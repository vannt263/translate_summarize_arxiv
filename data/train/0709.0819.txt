    "the two values of @xmath327 can be thought of as due to a different coupling strength between rotational inertia and the two helicity states of the muon .",

    "these values are significant in view of the precision with which @xmath337 have been determined .",

    "the external gravitational field only appears in the phase of the wave function .",
    "we have shown that the coupling of spin to inertia and gravitation follow from the solutions given .",
    "this allows a unified treatment of the interaction of gravity with spin and angular momentum without requiring ad hoc procedures .",
    "according to equations ( [ l ] ) and ( [ sol ] ) , the spin term @xmath417 finds its origin in the skew - symmetric part of the space - time connection . in the case of fermions",
    ", @xmath90 is accounted for by the spinorial connection .",
    "the terms that contain @xmath90 gives rise to the skrotskii effect for both electromagnetic @xcite and gravitational waves @xcite .    from the phases we have derived the geometrical optics of the particles and verified that their deflection is that predicted by general relativity .",
    "in addition , the background gravitational field acts as a medium whose index of refraction can be calculated for any metric from ( [ gph ] ) , ( [ photonmomentum ] ) and @xmath418 .      a more detailed treatment of the geometrical optics of single flavor neutrinos can be found in @xcite where we also calculate corrections due to the neutrino mass",
    ". for propagation parallel to the axis of rotation of the source , the rotation corrections vanish at infinity . not so for propagation perpendicular to the axis of rotation .",
    "we can finally conclude that the validity of covariant wave equations in an inertial - gravitational context finds support in experimental verifications of some of the effects they predict @xcite , in tests of the general relativistic deflection of light rays and also in the phase wrap - up in global position system measurements @xcite .",
    "we have then asked ourselves the question whether , beside the phase wrap - up in gps , there is a wider role for spin - gravity coupling in physics .",
    "in particular , we have considered muon @xmath280 experiments and helicity transitions in neutrino physics .",
    "we have found that spin - rotation coupling is largely responsible for producing the correct @xmath280 factor in the spin - flip angular frequency @xmath419 .",
    "measurements of this factor already provide the most stringent test yet of einstein s time dilation formula @xcite .",
    "however , muons in storage rings are also rotating quantum gyroscopes and inertia must be an essential ingredient of their description in experiments of high and ever increasing sensitivity . possibly these experiments also concern problems like the violation of the equivalence principle in quantum mechanics and the conservation of discrete symmetries in inertia - gravitation .",
    "we have , in fact , shown that a slightly anomalous inertial contribution to ( [ 11 ] ) at a level of the values @xmath420 and @xmath421 of section vii can produce violations of the discrete symmetries at the same level .",
    "the upper limits on the violations of @xmath24 and @xmath341 that can be reached by @xmath0 experiments are in fact as sensitive as those obtained by other means @xcite , but with an important difference .",
    "the @xmath280 measurements are performed in strictly controlled laboratory conditions rather than in astrophysical situations .    in derivations based on the covariant dirac equation",
    ", the coupling of inertia and gravitation to spin is identical to that for orbital angular momentum .",
    "a suggestive interpretation of this result is that the internal distributions of the gravitational mass , associated with the interaction , and of inertial mass , associated with the angular momentum , equal each other .",
    "this is no longer so when @xmath422 .",
    "there is almost a similarity , here , with the electromagnetic case where @xmath423 is required by the dirac equation , but not by quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the deviations of @xmath424 and @xmath425 from unity that are consistent with @xmath241 experiments are both of the order of @xmath282 , or @xmath426 , and differ from each other by @xmath427 . while small values of @xmath428 do not give rise to measurable mass differences in macroscopic objects @xcite , violations of the discrete symmetries can have interesting astrophysical and cosmological implications .",
    "next , we have calculated the helicity transition amplitudes of ultra - relativistic , single flavor neutrinos as they propagate in a lense - thirring field .",
    "these transitions are interesting because at high energies chirality states are predominantly helicity states and right - handed neutrinos do not interact @xcite .",
    "the transition probabilities are of @xmath429 .",
    "two directions of propagation have again been selected and the results contain contributions from both mass and angular momentum of the source",
    ". the transitions also occur in the absence of rotation or with spin parallel to rotation , which is unexpected on semiclassical grounds .",
    "the mass contributions predominate when the neutrinos propagate from @xmath430 to @xmath431 ( and matter effects are neglected ) , provided the impact parameter @xmath432 .",
    "there is , however , a narrow region about the axis of propagation in the equatorial plane where the @xmath433 contribution is larger .",
    "the rotational contribution behaves differently in the two cases .",
    "it vanishes as @xmath434 for propagation along @xmath134 , but not so as @xmath435 in the second case .",
    "in addition , when the neutrinos propagate from @xmath436 to @xmath437 , the mass term dominates in the neighborhood of the poles , while the contribution of @xmath433 is larger close to the equator , with no attenuation at @xmath438 .",
    "in @xcite we have also calculated gravity induced , two - flavor oscillations and derived the relative equation and effective hamiltonian .",
    "the transition probabilities do indeed oscillate for the lense - thirring metric , and the curvature of space - time enters the oscillation probability through the gravitational red - shift of the local energy @xmath439 and the proper distance @xmath440 .",
    "the results presented in this paper can be applied to a number of problems in astroparticle physics and cosmology @xcite .",
    "for instance , an interesting question is whether gravity induced helicity and flavor transitions could effect changes in the ratio @xmath441 of the expected fluxes at earth",
    ".    lepton asymmetry in the universe @xcite also is an interesting problem .",
    "it is known that the active - sterile oscillation of neutrinos can generate a discrepancy in the neutrino and antineutrino number densities .",
    "the lepton number of a neutrino of flavor @xmath442 is defined by @xmath443 , where @xmath444 is the number density of neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) and @xmath445 is the number density of photons at temperature @xmath341 .",
    "as noted above , the gravitational field generates transitions from left - handed ( active ) neutrinos to right - handed ( sterile ) neutrinos .",
    "if , in primordial conditions , ( [ alfa infinito ] ) and ( [ pinfinitox ] ) become larger , then helicity transitions may contribute in some measure to lepton asymmetry .    finally , we have recently re - examined the behavior of the spin - gravity interaction and found that gravity can distinguish between chirality and helicity @xcite .",
    "we have also found that the spin - gravity interaction can distinguish between dirac and majorana wave packets @xcite . a spin - flip does in fact change a majorana neutrino into an antineutrino and",
    "behaves like a charge conjugation operation .",
    "the spin - gravity couplings discussed in our work make use of the weak field approximation in which gravity enters as a non - dynamical field .",
    "there are , of course , physical situations in which this approach can be trusted and the general agreement between the quasi - classical and the quantum mechanical approaches has been established @xcite .",
    "one could then be tempted to extend our approximation procedure to any order in the metric deviation , as suggested by equations ( [ n ] ) , ( [ phasephi ] ) and ( [ phase ] ) .",
    "this would however lead to inconsistencies that can only be removed , as shown by deser @xcite , by making use of the full non - linear apparatus of general relativity .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed , in calculating the phases induced by gravity , that all possible particle paths reduce , in the average , to the phase integration paths .",
    "this approximation worsens the more `` quantum mechanical '' particles and gravity become .",
    "an additional point concerns the use of the locality hypothesis in replacing non - inertial frames with inertial ones . as shown by mashhoon @xcite , this hypothesis has limitations and important consequences for the measuring process . for standard",
    "accelerated measuring devices , for instance , it entails the introduction of a maximal acceleration @xcite . in the absence of inertial frames , of a complete formulation of spin - gravity couplings in curved space - time and of direct experimental observations , assigning a role to curvature in spin related problems",
    "may then prove difficult , though worthy of investigation .",
    "a final question regards the validity of the equivalence principle in spin - gravity interactions . in @xmath280 experiments",
    "the interaction of spin with gravity depends on the relative direction of spin and rotation of the source . as such it is not universal and",
    "may be regarded as violating those formulations of the equivalence principle that hinge on universality . but a more fundamental violation has been introduced in section vii where the strength of the coupling itself depends on the helicity of the particle @xcite .",
    "this is a violation of the post - newtonian equivalence principle , recently discussed by silenko and teryaev @xcite , by which a particle s spin and angular momenta precession frequencies coincide .",
    "this principle must be the object of rigorous experimental verifications and the authors themselves suggest a number of tests to find even more precise upper limits than those determined by using muon @xmath280 experiments @xcite . in a closely related paper @xcite ,",
    "the same authors show that the spin - gravity dipole coupling term found by obukhov @xcite using the eriksen - korlsrud transformation @xcite does not lead to observable effects .",
    "recently , impressive technical developments in the field of masers @xcite have succeeded in placing an upper limit of @xmath446 on violations of lorentz and @xmath290 symmetries .",
    "higher sensitivities are expected to be reached in the near future .",
    "since the interaction energy for a spin-@xmath447 particle in the rotation field of earth is of the same order of magnitude , these developments bode well for the physics of spin - gravity interactions .",
