    "many of the physical challenges of solar and stellar physics arise from magnetic processes taking place in the outer regions of the atmosphere .",
    "unfortunately , our present empirical knowledge on the magnetism of the chromosphere , transition region and corona is still very crude . in our opinion , there are two key avenues that should be pursued to improve the situation .",
    "firstly , new instrumentation is needed , including a space - borne uv polarimeter and a large ground - based solar telescope optimized for ( spectro-)polarimetric observations ( e.g. , the advanced technology solar telescope ) . secondly , but equally importantly ,",
    "we need appropriate diagnostic tools that will permit us to infer the magnetic field vector from the observed polarization in suitably chosen spectral ( chromospheric and coronal ) lines .",
    "the present paper represents a contribution to this second line of research .",
    "in particular , our aim here is to demonstrate that the determination of the magnetic field vector via the analysis of the observed polarization in the 10830   multiplet must be carried out considering the wavelength positions and the strengths of the zeeman components in the incomplete paschen - back effect regime .",
    "previous research done with this multiplet has ignored this effect ( with the only exception of @xcite @xcite ) , which resulted in considerable confusion surrounding the formation physics of these lines .",
    "the 10830   multiplet originates between a lower term ( @xmath1 ) and an upper term ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore , it comprises three spectral lines ( see , e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) : a ` blue ' component at 10829.09    with @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( hereafter transition  1 , or tr1 for abbreviation ) , and two ` red ' components at 10830.25    with @xmath5 ( hereafter , tr2 ) and at 10830.34     with @xmath6 ( hereafter , tr3 ) which appear blended at solar atmospheric temperatures . as shown in fig  [ energy ] , the energy difference between the levels with @xmath6 and @xmath5 is such that their respective magnetic substates cross each other for magnetic strengths between 400  g and 1500  g , approximately",
    ". therefore , _ at least _ in this range of strengths , the zeeman splitting of such @xmath7-levels is comparable to their energy separation . as a result , the perturbation theory of the familiar zeeman effect is no longer valid .",
    "the energy positions of the magnetic substates as a function of the field strength have to be calculated in the incomplete paschen - back effect regime , which requires to diagonalize the _ total _ hamiltonian ( see , e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , as we shall see below , the proper calculation of the zeeman components results in significant differences in the stokes profiles that emerge from a magnetized stellar atmosphere . furthermore",
    ", such differences do not vanish in the limit of weak fields .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 presents a brief review of the paschen - back effect theory , illustrating the range of magnetic strengths for which the @xmath7-levels of the @xmath2 term cross .",
    "section 3 shows a detailed comparison of the results that we have obtained assuming linear zeeman splitting ( lzs ) or incomplete paschen - back splittings ( ipbs ) , including an analytical demonstration that explains our numerical radiative transfer results in a milne - eddington model .",
    "finally , section 4 gives our concluding remarks .",
    "according to the theory of the zeeman effect ( see , e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) the corrections to the degenerate energy @xmath8 of any atomic level of total angular momentum quantum number @xmath7 are obtained by diagonalizing the matrix @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the magnetic hamiltonian , given by : @xmath11 with @xmath12  erg  g@xmath13 being the bohr magneton . by choosing the quantization z - axis of total angular momentum along the magnetic field vector , one finds : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the land factor .",
    "this equation shows that , to first order of perturbation theory , any atomic level of total angular momentum quantum number @xmath7 is split by the action of a magnetic field into @xmath16 _ equally spaced _",
    "sublevels , the splitting being proportional to the land factor @xmath15 and to the magnetic field strength .",
    "it is important to note that a state of the form @xmath17 is an eigenvector of the _ total _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath18 , with eigenvalue @xmath19 , only when the z - axis of the reference system points in the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the previous well - known results of first - order perturbation theory are correct only if the splitting produced by the magnetic field on a @xmath20level is small compared to the energy separation between the different @xmath20levels of the @xmath21 term under consideration . in other words , the standard theory of the zeeman effect is valid only in the limit of `` weak '' magnetic fields . here ,",
    "`` weak '' means that the coupling of either the spin or the orbital angular momentum to the magnetic field is _ weaker _ than the coupling between the spin and the orbital angular momentum ( the spin - orbit coupling ) .",
    "this is the so - called _ zeeman effect regime_.    in the opposite limit , the magnetic field is so `` strong '' that the spin - orbit interaction can be considered as a perturbation compared to the magnetic interaction . in this case",
    "the magnetic field dissolves the fine structure coupling  that is , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are practically decoupled and precess independently around @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the quantum number @xmath7 loses its meaning . in this so - called _ complete paschen - back effect regime _",
    "the magnetic hamiltonian is diagonal on the basis @xmath25 , and the eigenvalues are given by : @xmath26 in this `` strong '' field regime , the term @xmath21 splits into a number of components , each of which corresponds to particular values of @xmath27 . in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the corrections to the energy of the state @xmath28 due to the spin - orbit interaction has the form @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a constant with dimensions of energy .",
    "it is of interest to note that , since the spin - orbit coupling increases rapidly with increasing nuclear charge , the conditions for a `` strong '' field are met at a much lower field with light atoms ( like helium ) than with heavy atoms . in fact , as shown in fig  [ energy ] , the levels with @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the upper term @xmath33 of the 10830   multiplet cross for magnetic strengths between 400  g and 1500  g , approximately .",
    "this level - crossing regime corresponds to the _ incomplete paschen - back effect regime _ ,",
    "in which the energy eigenvectors are gradually evolving from the form @xmath34 to the form @xmath35 as the magnetic field increases .",
    "this range between the limiting cases of `` weak '' fields ( zeeman effect regime ) and `` strong '' fields ( complete paschen - back regime ) is more difficult to analyze since it implies the evaluation of matrix elements of the form @xmath36 , which ( in general ) can only be done numerically . to this aim",
    ", we have developed a numerical code capable of computing , for a magnetic field of arbitrary intensity , the strenghts and the splittings of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 components in a line multiplet arising from the transition between two @xmath21 terms .",
    "this code is very similar to a previous one that solves the problem of the intermediate paschen - back effect in a line with hyperfine structure ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "we have developed a numerical code for the synthesis and inversion of stokes profiles in a milne - eddington atmosphere , considering ipbs as described in  [ ipb ] .",
    "this code has been built with the aim of analyzing spectropolarimetric observations of solar active regions , but we shall use it here to explore the effects of ipbs on the 10830 polarization profiles .",
    "we consider a reference model atmosphere and calculate the multiplet component positions and strengths for various magnetic fields ( ranging from 0 to 3  kg ) .",
    "the zeeman components are calculated accounting for ipbs and then compared to the usual approximation of lzs",
    ". the most relevant parameters of the chosen milne - eddington model are @xmath39 , @xmath40  m , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( see , e.g. , @xcite @xcite for definitions of the milne - eddington parameters ) .",
    "sample profiles are depicted in fig  [ fig : profiles ] for a 500  g field with an inclination of 50@xmath44 from the line of sight .",
    "there are a few obvious differences between the ipbs and lzs stokes  v profiles : a )  the blue component of the multiplet , tr1 , shows a net asymmetry with a global offset towards negative values ; components of this transition , with the red component being stronger . ]",
    "b )  a small non - doppler blueshift of the same component ( which is actually related to the asymmetry ) ; c )  a reduced amplitude of the red and blue lobes of the red component of the multiplet ( tr2 and tr3 ) .",
    "the linear polarization profiles exhibit also some small asymmetry .",
    "these differences are due to ipbs effects on the zeeman components of the transitions , discussed in  [ comp ] below .",

    "these are listed in table  [ tblatom ] .",
    "note that some of the values do not coincide with those used by other authors in previous works .",
    "for example , concerning the lzs calculations the effective land factor ( @xmath49 ) of tr3 is 1.25 , whereas @xcite ( @xcite ) and @xcite ( @xcite ) take it to be 0.875 .",
    "the relative strengths , which is used here and in other previous works on this multiplet , refers to the relative strengths of the components .",
    "these are not the `` oscillator strengths '' of the transitions , which are also commonly denoted by @xmath50 . ]",
    "( @xmath50 ) of tr1 , tr2 and tr3 are here 0.111 , 0.333 and 0.556 , respectively .",
    "our @xmath50 agree with those of @xcite ( @xcite ) , but not with @xcite ( @xcite ) ( these authors quote _ relative oscillator strengths _ , but the conversion is straightforward ) .",
    "it is not completely clear to us what the source of the discrepancy is . for the @xmath49 we used its standard definition ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) applied to the quantum numbers shown in the table .",
    "the @xmath50 are calculated according to the usual formulae ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "thus , both of these quantities are derived straightforwardly from well - known atomic parameters . as we discuss below",
    ", it is not possible to reproduce the observations using the lzs approximation .",
    "it is conceivable that other authors had to modify their atomic parameters in an attempt to compensate for ipbs effects .",
    "this would allow them to fit observed profiles with those calculated using lzs .",
    "for example , the ratio of stokes  v amplitudes of the blue and red components calculated with lzs is significantly larger than it should be . artificially reducing the @xmath49 of tr3 reduces the amplitude of the red component without affecting the intensity profiles , thus bringing the profiles closer to the observations .",

    "tables  2 to  4 list the actual ipbs values at 500  g , which are also useful to match the curves in the left and right panels .",
    "note that the positions of the tr1 components are not significantly disturbed by the presence of the other levels ( @xmath7=1 and @xmath7=2 ) in the field range depicted in the plots .",
    "however , the strength of the @xmath37 components is indeed perturbed , introducing an asymmetry between the left- and right - handed polarizations . for our discussions in  [ weak ] below it is important to note that this asymmetry increases linearly with the magnetic field .",
    "the positions of the tr2 and tr3 components feel a much stronger perturbation for fields stronger than @xmath0500  g. this is due to the close proximity in the energy diagram of the upper levels of these transitions ( the @xmath32 and @xmath31 levels ) . similarly to the case of tr1 , the component strengths of tr2 and tr3 become asymmetric .",
    "the asymmetry is rather linear for weak fields . as the field increases above @xmath0500  g , however , the behavior of the component strengths becomes non - linear .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note the presence of a @xmath38 component in tr2 that does not exist in the lzs approximation .",
    "this new component appears for non - zero fields in ipbs and becomes more important as the field increases .",
    "the asymmetries between left- and right - handed @xmath37 components in all three transitions , are important .",
    "they ultimately manifest themselves as asymmetries in the profiles and lead to net circular polarization even in the absence of velocity or magnetic field gradients .",
    "fig  [ components ] shows that the zeeman components of the various transitions tend towards the lzs values as the magnetic strength goes to zero .",
    "one may thus expect that the ipbs profiles ( plotted in the top row ) would become similar to the lzs profiles in the weak field limit . however , this is not the case .",
    "the profiles obtained from our calculations maintain their shape unchanged down to the lower limit of our simulation ( 0.1  g ) .",
    "this apparent paradox has a simple , albeit slightly counterintuitive , explanation .",
    "the stokes  v profiles can be described conceptually as the subtraction of two bell - type functions , similar to gaussians or lorentzians . in the weak field limit",
    "the separation between these functions is much smaller than their width , and the resulting stokes  v profile is essentially a small residual of the subtraction .",
    "a slight asymmetry between the two functions will show more conspicuously the closer together they are .",
    "therefore , reducing the field results in `` amplifying '' the red / blue asymmetries .",
    "let us analyze this in some detail considering a very simple scenario .",
    "suppose that we have a stokes  v profile that is the result of subtracting two gaussians separated by a small distance @xmath53 : @xmath54 the zero - crossing wavelength ( @xmath55 ) of @xmath56 is given by the condition : @xmath57 which , taking logarithms on both sides , leads to : @xmath58 if the asymmetry is small ( @xmath59 ) , a taylor expansion of the logarithm yields : @xmath60 for weak fields , the asymmetry @xmath61 depends linearly on the field ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "we then conclude that : @xmath63 i.e. , the zero - crossing wavelength is shifted and does _ not _ depend on the magnetic field . in the derivation above we have been concerned only with strength asymmetries , neglecting the effect of asymmetric component positions .",
    "if we denote by @xmath64 and @xmath65 the ( different ) component positions , a similar straightforward reasoning can be conducted to conclude that : @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "it is evident from eq  ( [ x02 ] ) that position asymmetries have only a second - order effect on @xmath55 , since @xmath68 is proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "we verified this property with our simulations .",
    "consider now the area asymmetry : @xmath70 in the weak - field limit , the denominator of eq  ( [ area ] ) is directly proportional to the field .",
    "thus : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a constant . expanding the exponentials in eq  ( [ prof ] ) in a taylor series and truncating to first order",
    ", we obtain that for @xmath73 : @xmath74 thus : @xmath75 inserting this into eq  ( [ area2 ] ) and taking into account the odd parity of the second term in eq  ( [ vweak ] ) , it is evident that : @xmath76 therefore , the net area asymmetry @xmath77 remains constant even for fields approaching zero .",
    "all of the asymptotic properties of stokes  v derived in this section ( constancy of the zero - crossing wavelength , net asymmetry , relative importance of weight and position asymmetries ) have been confirmed by further modeling using our numerical code .",
    "it is important to note that the results we present here do not violate the principle of spectroscopic stability , since the zeeman components ( and their center of gravity ) approach asymptotically the lzs values .",
    "the asymptotic values that we obtained for tr1 are @xmath55=340  m  s@xmath13 and @xmath78=0.11 ( with the red lobe having a larger area ) .",
    "it must be noted that this value of @xmath77 is influenced by the blend with the blue wing of the red component .",
    "we estimated the effect of this blend by calculating @xmath79 for the lzs profile ( which should be zero ) , obtaining @xmath80=0.04 . in this case",
    "it is the blue lobe that has larger area .",
    "therefore , the presence of the blend has the effect of reducing the @xmath78 of the ipbs profile .",
    "the actual value of @xmath55 is significantly model - dependent .",
    "in particular , it is very sensitive to the doppler width of the line . doubling this parameter in our model ,",
    "resulted in a factor 4 increase of @xmath55 .",
    "for the red component of the multiplet ( tr2 and tr3 ) , we obtained @xmath55=95  m  s@xmath13 and @xmath78=0.05 . here , as opposed to tr1 , the zero - crossing is redshifted and the blue lobe has a larger area .",
    "the dependence of @xmath55 and @xmath78 for both lines are plotted in figs  [ zerocross ] and  [ asym ] .",
    "the calculations reported in this paper show that ipbs effects need to be taken into account for proper diagnostics based on the multiplet at 10830   .",
    "this is a very interesting set of lines , with some unique properties that make it an ideal tool for the exploration of chromospheric and coronal magnetism .",
    "care must be taken , however , to consider all the relevant physical processes that intervene in the formation of the lines .",
    "the ( still few ) works existing in the literature regarding stokes observations of these lines do not seem to agree on such fundamental parameters as : the rest wavelength of the tr1 line ; the effective land factor of the tr3 line ; the relative strengths of the transitions ( compare the values given in @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; this work ) .",
    "these are basic parameters that should be well known , either from laboratory experiments or from very simple calculations .",
    "we believe that , at least partly , the existing confusion might have its origin in neglecting ipbs effects .",
    "we have shown that ipbs is responsible for a non - doppler blueshift of tr1 , systematic profile asymmetries and a reduced amplitude of stokes  v in the tr2+tr3 blend . as an illustrative example , consider the simple line - ratio experiment represented in fig  [ vratio ] . for a fixed model atmosphere ,",
    "the ratio of stokes  v amplitudes in the red ( tr2+tr3 ) and the blue ( tr1 ) components of the multiplet depends smoothly on the magnetic field .",
    "it is clear from the figure that neglecting ipbs leads to an erroneous estimate of the field .",
    "interestingly , the ipbs curve is steeper than the lzs one , indicating that it is more sensitive to the field .",
    "some ipbs signatures described in this paper are probably present in published observations .",
    "if one compares the tr1 stokes  v profile depicted in our fig  [ fig : profiles ] ( upper right panel ) with those of @xcite ( @xcite ) ( figs  4 and  5 ) , the resemblance is striking . more specifically , the ipbs blueshift and the net offset towards negative values both become immediately apparent .",
    "profile asymmetries are also present in their observations .",
    "however , it is not possible to assess whether these arise from ipbs or from velocity or magnetic field gradients ."
