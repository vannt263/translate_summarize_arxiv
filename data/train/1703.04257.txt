    "alternatively , we may think of such a map as a rank 1 null subbundle of the trivial bundle @xmath75 .",

    "it should come as no surprise that the sphere @xmath48 corresponding to @xmath154 coincides with the classical notion of a curvature sphere , i.e. , a sphere tangent to the surface @xmath121 with radius @xmath164 . therefore , for any point @xmath74 , @xmath165 has second order contact with @xmath121 in the principal curvature direction @xmath166 .      let @xmath167 denote @xmath10 union its ( possible empty ) ideal boundary @xmath168 .",

    "mbius transformations are of course a special case of this .",
