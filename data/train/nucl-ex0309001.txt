    "the current interest in @xmath11 decay is due to the fact that its existence is closely linked to the following fundamental aspects of particle physics @xcite : + -lepton number non - conservation ; + -existence of neutrino mass and its nature ; + -existence of right - handed currents in the electroweak interactions ; + -existence of the majoron ; + -the higgs sector structure ; + -existence of leptoquarks ; + -heavy sterile neutrino and composite neutrino .",
    "+ all these questions lie beyond the scope of the standard model of electroweak interactions and so the detection of @xmath12 decay will give rise to \" new physics \" .",
    "the primary interest in this process is the question of neutrino mass :  -the detection of @xmath11 decay will allow to establish the absolute neutrino mass scale and will indicate that this mass is of majorana type .",
    "the recent results from atmospheric @xcite , solar @xcite , and reactor @xcite neutrino experiments indicate that neutrinos have mass and they mix .",
    "this very exciting result has greatly renewed the interest in @xmath13 decay since the oscillation experiments show that the next generation of double beta decay experiments will have a good chance of measuring the absolute mass of the neutrino . to date , only lower bounds on half - lives ( @xmath14 ) have been obtained experimentally for a number of double beta decay isotopes .",
    "these bounds are used to deduce upper limits on the majorana neutrino mass , the right - handed current admixture parameter , the majoron - majorana neutrino coupling constant etc .",
    "however , uncertainties in nuclear matrix element ( nme ) calculations do not allow reliable limits to be placed on these fundamental values . in this context the detection of two - neutrino",
    "double beta decay @xmath15 becomes of particular importance because information on experimental values of nme ( 2@xmath3 ) for different nuclei enables a more accurate calculation of both nme ( 2@xmath3 ) and nme ( 0@xmath16 ) .",
    "+ a liquid argon detector @xcite was designed by the dba collaboration to study the double - beta decay of @xmath0mo .",
    "the @xmath0mo isotope was selected for the study because of its large @xmath17 transition energy ( e@xmath18 = 3033 kev ) . in 1996",
    "the experimental setup was installed in the gran sasso underground laboratory ( italy ) . in this work",
    "we describe the technique used in the experiment .",
    "special attention is paid to the design of the experimental setup , calibration procedure and performance of the detector components .",
    "the experiment was carried out in the gran sasso underground laboratory located at a depth of 3500 m w.e .",
    "( meters of water equivalent ) . the experimental setup ( fig .",
    "[ exsetup ] ) consists of a liquid argon ionization detector enclosed in passive lead shielding , a gas supply system , a radon protection system , a mechanical crane used for detector assembling and disassembling , electronics and a data acquisition system . the equipment was mounted on a special concrete platform with dimensions of 4@xmath190.6 m. to suppress mechanical vibrations the platform was supported on a rubber sheet .",
    "the platform carried a special \" house \" which protected the equipment from the moist atmosphere underground .",
    "the data acquisition and readout system of the detector was placed in another \" house \" located 2 m away from the platform .          the detector is mainly constructed of titanium and its alloys .",
    "all the insulators in the electrode system were made of fluoroplastic .",
    "a sketch of the detector is shown in fig .",
    "[ chamber ] .",
    "the detector was cooled with liquid nitrogen that was fed into a nitrogen volume ( 2 ) from a 4000 l dewar vessel .",
    "the liquid nitrogen was pumped to the detector through a pipeline , enclosed in vacuum heat insulation to reduce the liquid nitrogen flow rate , which was necessary for long period of routine data taking .",
    "the nitrogen volume ( 2 ) was thermally insulated from the environment with a vacuum casing ( 3 ) .",
    "the inner wall of the volume was coated with 12 layers of 10 @xmath20m - thick aluminized mylar .",
    "this thermal insulation allowed the liquid nitrogen flow rate to be reduced to 6 l / h .",
    "the nitrogen volume ( 2 ) was connected to a chamber ( 4 ) , in which a vessel ( 1 ) with liquid argon was housed , with a tube to equalize the nitrogen vapor pressure in these volumes .",
    "heaters ( 5 ) located on the outside wall of the vessel ( 1 ) regulated the liquid argon temperature .",
    "the electrode system that formed the sensitive volume of the detector was placed in the vessel ( 1 ) , 40 cm in diameter and 70 cm high .",
    "the active detection portion of the detector was composed of identical sections ( fig .",
    "[ elsy ] ) each section consisted of two combined flat ionization chambers with screening grids ( 2 ) and a common cathode ( 3 ) . a foil made of the isotope under study ( molybdenum )",
    "was inserted into a circular cathode frame .",
    "the sensitive volume was 30 cm in diameter and 56 cm high .",
    "the detector contained 14 cathodes , 15 anodes , and 28 screening grids .",
    "the grid - anode and grid - cathode gaps were 5.5 and 14.5 mm , respectively .",
    "the anodes ( 4 ) had the same design as the grids .",
    "the screening grids and anodes were made with 110 @xmath20 m ni - cr wires wound with a 1 mm spacing .",
    "the top and the bottom anodes ( 1 ) of the electrode system were solid titanium discs .",
    "the high voltage applied to the cathodes and the grids was -4.8 and -2 kv , respectively .",
    "charge sensitive preamplifiers converted the charge , produced on each anode , into a voltage pulse .",
    "the detector cathodes were made of molybdenum foil 50 mg/@xmath21 thick .",
    "the four cathodes of enriched molybdenum ( 98.4 % of @xmath0mo ) were first investigated in three experimental runs of 202 , 238 , and 313 h duration . to suppress the radioactive background these cathodes",
    "were mounted at the center of the electrode system and interleaved with cathodes of natural molybdenum ( containing 9.6 % of @xmath0mo ) .",
    "the activity of radioactive impurities in the molybdenum foil samples was less then 0.015 bq / kg for @xmath22bi , 0.0015 bq / kg for @xmath23ti and 0.04 bq / kg for @xmath24pa .",
    "the total mass of @xmath0mo under study was 138.7 g. later , the @xmath0mo mass in the detector was increased to 306 g ( eight cathodes of @xmath0mo ) .",
    "the interleaved arrangement of the natural and enriched molybdenum cathodes allowed a differential measurement to be made . in this method",
    "one can subtract the natural sections spectrum from the enriched sections spectrum yielding a pure 2@xmath3 effect .",
    "the total measurement time with eight @xmath0mo cathodes was 2706 h.          the gas supply system ( fig .",
    "[ gas ] ) consisted of 22 40 l stainless steel bottles with gaseous argon under a pressure of about 150 bar , a gas purification system ( 3 ) , and a gas purity control system ( 1 ) .",
    "six of these bottles were housed in stainless steel dewar vessels .",
    "after the measurements they were used as a cryogenic pump to transfer the liquid argon from the chamber to the bottles .",
    "the gas purification system ( 3 ) had a titanium sponge as its main element due to a low concentration of radioactive impurities in this getter .",
    "for example , a purification system based on an oxysorb absorber or a molecular sieve releases 1001000 times more @xmath8rn because the @xmath25u content in these materials ( approximately 10@xmath26 to 10@xmath27 g / g ) exceeds that of titanium by the same factor .",
    "after a single pass of gaseous argon through the titanium sponge at a temperature of 850 @xmath28c the concentration of electronegative impurities was under 1.9@xmath29 equiv .",
    "o@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the content of electronegative impurities in argon was monitored with a two - phase detector ( 1 ) @xcite .",
    "the absorber vessel , made of high - temperature steel , was a cylinder 50 mm in diameter and 300 mm high filled with the titanium sponge .",
    "the argon flow rate during the purification phase was 0.6 m@xmath31/h .",
    "the 15 cm thick passive shielding of lead was installed on a concrete platform .",
    "note that the measured radon activity in the ambient air was 200 bq / m@xmath31 ( for comparison , the radon activity in the other halls of the gran sasso underground laboratory was 40 bq / m@xmath31 ) . to suppress radon diffusion from the environment the nitrogen vapor from the detector s cooling system was flushed through a heat exchanger , heated to 20 @xmath28c and directed inside the passive shielding . with the same aim in mind hollow organic glass blocks",
    "were placed next to the detector inside the passive shielding ( in order to reduce the volume of air inside the shielding ) . as a result",
    ", the background due to @xmath8rn near the detector ( inside the passive shielding ) was suppressed to a level of @xmath32 2 bq / m@xmath31 ( before installation of the organic glass blocks it was 50 bq / m@xmath31 ) .",
    "the passive neutron shielding included a 25 cm thick water layer to thermalize neutrons and a 1 cm thick layer of boric acid ( h@xmath33 ) powder to capture the thermalized neutrons .",
    "preliminary estimates showed that such shielding should provide an almost tenfold suppression of the background due to high - energy gamma s produced from the neutron capture in the detector .",
    "the experimental test demonstrated that the suppression factor for energies above 4 mev was approximately eight .",
    "a diagram of the electronics and data readout system used in the experiment is shown in fig .  [ electron ] .",
    "the outputs from all 15 anodes go to 15 ceramic feedthroughs .",
    "these signal feedthroughs , mounted on the lid of the liquid argon chamber ( ( 1 ) in fig.2 ) , were connected to the charge sensitive preamplifiers located on the upper lid of the detector .",
    "each electronic channel consisted of a charge sensitive preamplifier , an amplifier , and an analog to digital converter ( adc ) with a 20 mhz sampling frequency .",
    "since each channel recorded both shaped ( @xmath34= 3.6 @xmath20s ) and unshaped ( no filtering ) signals , 30 flash adcs were used .",
    "spatial information on the events was obtained by analyzing the shape of the unfiltered pulses .",
    "a macintosh computer with the macua 1 data acquisition software was used for both recording the data and controlling the electronics .",
    "the programs for raw data histograming and an event display were written in the same software environment .",
    "the trigger for data collection required that at least one anode signal exceeded the 700 kev threshold .",
    "each trigger caused digitized signals from all anodes to be written to a data tape .",
    "such a universal triggering pattern allowed the use of the power of pulse shape analysis to reduce the background and allowed the investigation of single electron spectra and the extraction of limits on @xmath7ar and @xmath8rn content in liquid argon ( see section 3 ) .",

    "df / dn is the first derivative of the polynomial fit to the calibration spectrum ; f(n ) - counts number per one channel ;  n - channel number.,width=340 ]    the detector filled with liquid argon was calibrated with external gamma sources .",
    "the calibration was aimed at ( a ) providing a relationship between the amount of energy deposited in the detector s fiducial volume and the ionization signal amplitude recorded by the readout electronics and ( b ) determining and monitoring the stability and energy resolution of the detector .",
    "the response of the electronics was regularly tested for linearity and stability with a voltage pulse generator .",
    "the integral nonlinearity was @xmath32 1 % throughout the dynamic range .",
    "a small 2 % drift of the amplifiers gains was observed over the period of data taking and was corrected using the pulse generator data .",
    "two @xmath36-ray sources were selected for the calibration : @xmath37na ( t@xmath38 = 2.6 yr , e@xmath39 = 1275 kev ) and @xmath35y ( t@xmath38 = 106.6 days , e@xmath40= 1836 kev ) .",
    "since the photoelectric effect probability depends heavily on the atomic number of the element ( p@xmath41 ) and the atomic number of argon is relatively small ( z = 18 ) , it is virtually impossible to use the photoelectric effect to calibrate the liquid argon detector .",
    "however , the energy spectrum of compton electrons is appropriate for this purpose if the source intensity is high enough to allow the fitting of the high energy edge of the compton spectrum followed by its differentiation .",
    "this approach was used in the calibration procedure .",
    "a fifth degree polynomial function was chosen to fit the spectrum .",
    "the peak of the first derivative of the fit function corresponds to the maximum energy of the compton electrons . for @xmath37na and @xmath35y",
    "this energy is 1063 and 1610 kev , respectively .",
    "each channel was calibrated independently .",
    "typical single channel calibration spectra of @xmath37na and @xmath35y sources are shown in fig .",
    "[ calibr ] .",
    "the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the distribution for the channel shown was about 18 % for 1063 kev ( @xmath37na ) and 12 % for 1610 kev ( @xmath35y ) .",
    "the resolution of the other channels varied from this value by no more than @xmath4210 % .",
    "it is worth noting that the relative energy resolution changed with energy as 1/e rather than @xmath43 .",
    "this is because the major contribution to the energy resolution is capacitive noise in the electronics readout chain ( note the high value of the electrode s capacitance - 500 pf ) and the \" microphone effect \" .",
    "the latter is caused by mechanical vibrations of the anode and grid wires in the boiling liquid argon resulting in oscillation of the electrode capacitance value .",
    "the extrapolation of the @xmath37na and @xmath35y calibration results gives a 6 % energy resolution ( fwhm ) at the energy of the @xmath0mo @xmath17 decay transition ( 3033 kev ) .",
