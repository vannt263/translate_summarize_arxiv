    "recently the babar collaboration has observed a structure at 2175 mev in @xmath10 via initial - state radiation , which is consistent with @xmath4 resonance with a mass @xmath11 and width @xmath12@xcite .",
    "henceforth , this structure is denoted as @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the babar collaboration demonstrates that this structure is not due to the dominant @xmath13 intermediate states , and there is no known meson resonance with @xmath14 near this mass .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", we suggested that this structure is a @xmath4 strangeonium hybrid(@xmath15 ) and the decay properties are studied from both the flux tube model and the constitute gluon model .",
    "both the mass and decay width are consistent with the current experimental data in the hybrid scenario .",
    "moreover , we suggested that the tetraquark hypothesis for y(2175)@xcite is not favored by the current data in@xcite , although this picture can not be completely excluded .",
    "the mass of @xmath16(2175 ) which is assigned as a tetraquark state , has been calculated in qcd sum rule@xcite . to confirm that @xmath0 is hybrid or another exotic state , it is necessary to examine the radial excitation of quarkonium in the quark model to determine whether they imitate the decay and production properties of the hybrid state .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the decay of @xmath4 strange quarkonium(2@xmath17 ) and reveal possible experimental signals that can discriminate between the hybrid and the higher quarkonium .",
    "its quantum numbers @xmath18 implies that the possible quarkonium states are @xmath19 ( in the notation @xmath20 , denoting the @xmath21 state with spin @xmath22 , orbital angular momentum @xmath23 , and total angular momentum @xmath24 ) and so on . among these states , only the @xmath25 and @xmath26 strange quarkonium states have masses consistent with @xmath0 within the experimental error@xcite .",
    "the decay of @xmath25 strange quarkonium has been studied in detail in the @xmath3 model by t.barnes et al.,@xcite , and this state is predicted to be a rather broad resonance , @xmath27mev in the @xmath3 model , and it mainly decays into @xmath28 .",
    "however , the @xmath4 strangeonium hybrid that we predicted is much narrower @xmath29mev , and the @xmath6 mode is forbidden@xcite . since the width of @xmath25 strange quarkonium is much larger than that of @xmath0(@xmath12 ) , it is very difficult to identify @xmath0 as a @xmath25 strange quarkonium .    in this paper",
    ", we will calculate the partial widths of @xmath26 strange quarkonium to all okubo - zweig - iizuka-(ozi ) allowed two- body final states allowed by phase space . to assess the correctness of our analysis",
    ", we calculated the widths by using both the @xmath3 decay model@xcite and the flux tube breaking model@xcite .",
    "our goal is to shed some light on the nature of @xmath0 and reveal some promising signals that can discriminate the @xmath4 strangeonium hybrid picture form the @xmath26 strange quarkonium .    in this paper",
    ", we will study the decay of @xmath26 strange quarkonium from the @xmath3 model in sec .",
    "ii and from the flux tube model in sec .",
    "we use the simple harmonic approximation in both models so that the amplitudes can be derived analytically . finally , we present our summary and some discussions .",
    "the @xmath3 model ( quark pair creation model ) , which describes the process that a pair of quark - antiquark with quantum number @xmath30 is created from the vacuum was first proposed by micu@xcite in 1969 . in the 1970s ,",
    "this model was developed by yaouanc et al .",
    "@xcite and applied to study hadron decays extensively .",
    "the @xmath3 model is applicable to ozi - allowed strong decay of a meson into two other mesons , as well as the two body - decay of baryons and other hadrons@xcite . in the @xmath3 model ,",
    "the created quark pairs with any color and any flavor can be generated anywhere in space , but only those whose color - flavor wave functions and spatial wave functions overlap with those of outgoing hadrons can make a contribution to the final decay width .    it is widely assumed that @xmath3 model is successful because it provides a good description of many of the observed decay amplitudes and partial widths of open flavor meson strong decays .",
    "several published papers study the decay of light mesons , open charm mesons and charmonium using different wavefunction and phase space normalization@xcite .",
    "we will use the diagrammatic technique developed in ref.@xcite to derive the amplitudes and the @xmath3 matrix elements . in this formalism",
    ", the @xmath3 model describes decay matrix elements using a @xmath31 pair production hamiltonian , which is the nonrelativistic limit of , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a dirac quark field , @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the strength of the conventional @xmath3 mode , and @xmath36 is the mass of both created quarks . to determine a decay rate , we evaluate the matrix element of the decay hamiltonian between the initial and final states , @xmath37 to compare with the experiment , we transform the helicity @xmath38 into the partial wave amplitude @xmath39 by the recoupling calculation@xcite .",
    "then the decay width is : @xmath40 where relativistic phase space normalization has been taken , and @xmath41 is the momentum of the final states in the rest frame of @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath43^{1/2}}{2m_a}$ ] .",
    "the decay amplitudes for @xmath44 , @xmath45 etc can be derived analytically under the simple harmonic oscillator wavefunction approximation .",
    "the mass difference @xmath46 is ignored in the wavefunctions as ref.@xcite .",
    "however , this approximation may not be good in some channels , and we will clearly see the effect of large strange quark mass in the flux tube model in sec.iii . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the authors assume that the harmonic oscillation parameter @xmath47 of the initial state is the same as the @xmath48 of the final states . in the present paper ,",
    "we relax this assumption by allowing @xmath47 to be different from @xmath48 .",
    "we assume that the harmonic oscillation parameter of the final states and the pair - production amplitude respectively are @xmath49 as in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is theoretically expected that the magnitude of @xmath47 for higher excited states are smaller than those of lower states by @xmath50 gev , so we take @xmath51gev in our numerical calculations of the partial decay widths .",
    "meson mass are taken from the particle data group(pdg)-2006@xcite .",
    "if a state was not included in the meson summary table of pdg , we use an estimated mass motivated by the spectroscopy predictions@xcite , adjusted in the absolute value relative to the known masses . for the pseudoscalar @xmath52 and @xmath53 , we assume perfect mixing , and the flavor structures are as follows , @xmath54 the mixing angle is consistent with the angle obtained from the @xmath55 mass matrix . using the analytical decay amplitudes and including the flavor factors , summing over all final flavor states",
    ", we obtain the numerical value of the partial decay width for @xmath56 @xmath2 decay in the @xmath3 model , which are listed in the second column of the table i.    .the decay of y(2175 ) as @xmath56 strange quarkonium in the @xmath3 model and the flux tube model .",
    "@xmath57 is partial decay width , where @xmath23 represents the relative angular momentum between two final states , and @xmath24 is the total angular momentum of the final states .",
    "we choose @xmath58gev , @xmath51gev .",
    "the starred amplitudes vanish exactly with the simple harmonic oscillator wavefunction .",
    "the large difference in some channels is due to the large strange quark mass of the nodal suppression effect . for comparing the above predictions for y(2175 ) as a @xmath56 @xmath2 state with those of the possible hybrid interpretation in @xcite and of the possible @xmath59 quarkonium assignment in @xcite ,",
    "the corresponding results of @xcite and @xcite are listed in the final two columns of the table .",
    "note , the mass of @xmath25 @xmath2 state in @xcite was set to be 2050mev . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the @xmath60 @xmath2 state is predicted to be rather narrow in the @xmath3 model , @xmath61mev , so we can not exclude the possibility that @xmath0 could be a @xmath60 @xmath2 state . in the case of @xmath51gev ,",
    "the dominant decay modes are : @xmath62 all these lead to the important @xmath63 final state .",
    "we suggested in @xcite that if y(2175 ) is assigned as a hybrid , the decay modes of @xmath7 and @xmath6 are forbidden due to the famous selection rule@xcite and since @xmath64 is @xmath65 state , and @xmath66 is @xmath22-wave state .",
    "however , when y(2175 ) is as @xmath67 strange quarkonium discussed in this present paper , in contrast with the strangeonium hybrid picture , the widths of decay modes @xmath7 and @xmath6 are significantly larger ( please see table i ) .",
    "this remarkable feature is a criterion to distinguish the quarkonium interpretation from the hybrid assignment for y(2175 ) .",
    "therefore , experimentally observing the @xmath7 and @xmath6 decay modes of @xmath0 is crucial for exploring the nature of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 modes are near the nodes of the decay amplitudes , as a result , the decay widths corresponding to them are predicted to be rather small .",
    "furthermore , we can see another interesting property that @xmath60 @xmath2 prefers to decay into @xmath71 final states(table i ) .",
    "namely , @xmath72 has a large branch ratio if the problematical @xmath73 is a @xmath74 state .",
    "the @xmath6 mode is especially interesting and there are four partial widths , i.e. , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 . if y(2175 ) is a pure @xmath1 @xmath2 state , we predict @xmath79 , @xmath78 is the largest , and the ratio @xmath80 , which is independent of the radial wavefunction ( in table i @xmath81 , because we keep only two effective numbers in numerical results of partial widths there ) . however ,",
    "if y(2175 ) is assigned as a @xmath9 @xmath2 state , both @xmath76 and @xmath78 are predicted to be zero , and @xmath82 .",
    "determining the @xmath6 decay width ratios is very important to examine whether y(2175 ) is a @xmath1 or @xmath9 @xmath2 state .    to test the robustness of the these conclusions",
    ", we should study the stability of these results with respect to independent variations in @xmath47 and the mass of the initial state .",
    "we show the @xmath47 dependence of the partial widths and total width respectively in fig.1 and fig.2 .",
    "we can see that the width of @xmath83 depends weakly on @xmath47 , however , the partial width of the modes @xmath7 , @xmath72 , @xmath84 , @xmath6 and @xmath8 vary dramatically with @xmath47 . for small @xmath47(@xmath85 ) ,",
    "@xmath60 @xmath2 dominantly decays into @xmath7 , @xmath72 , @xmath86 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 , while it dominantly decays into @xmath84 , @xmath8 , @xmath6 , @xmath86 for large @xmath47 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "experimental observations of @xmath7 , @xmath6 or @xmath5 modes would be strong indications of a @xmath60 @xmath2 component . since a @xmath4 strangeonium hybrid decay into @xmath8",
    "is forbidden due to the `` spin selection '' rule@xcite , the @xmath8 mode is also very important in determining the nature of @xmath0 .     as a @xmath1 @xmath2 state in the @xmath3 model.,width=302 ]     as a @xmath1 @xmath2 state in the @xmath3 model.,width=302 ]    the variation of the partial decay width and total width with the mass of the initial state are shown in fig.3 and fig.4 , respectively , where the initial state mass is denoted as @xmath88 , and we choose @xmath51 gev .",
    "the total width becomes large with increasing @xmath88 .",
    "interestingly , the partial decay widths @xmath89 and @xmath90 decrease when the mass of @xmath1 state increases .",
    "this is because the modes @xmath84 and @xmath8 are closer to the nodes of the decay amplitude with increasing @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , both the @xmath7 and @xmath6 modes always have a sizable branch ratio in the mass region @xmath91 gev .     as a @xmath1 @xmath2 state in the @xmath3 model.,width=302 ]     as a @xmath1 @xmath2 state in the @xmath3 model.,width=302 ]",
    "the flux tube model is extracted from the strong coupling limit of the qcd lattice hamiltonian@xcite . in flux tube mode ,",
    "a meson consists of a quark and antiquark connected by discretized quantum string . for conventional mesons ,",
    "the string is in its ground state .",
    "vibrational excitation of the string corresponds to the hybrid mesons@xcite .",
    "the flux tube model extends the @xmath3 model by including the dynamics of the flux tube .",
    "this is done by including a factor that represents the overlap of initial meson flux tube with those of the two final mesons . though the two models are not identical , their quantitative futures are similar@xcite , and the flux tube model coincides with the @xmath3 model in the limit of infinitely thick flux - tube .",
    "in the rest frame of @xmath42 , the decay amplitude of an initial meson a into two final mesons @xmath92 and @xmath93 is , @xmath94 where both the flavor and spin overlaps have been omitted in the above amplitude , and @xmath95 is the flux - tube overlap function , which measures the spatial dependence of the pair creation amplitude .",
    "the initial quark and antiquark of the initial meson @xmath42 are assumed to be of the same mass @xmath96 , and @xmath97 is the mass of the created quark pair .",
    "@xmath98 is the pair creation position , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are respectively the quark - antiquark axes of a , b , and c mesons , they are related by @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "for the conventional meson decay , the flux - tube overlap function is usually chosen as the following form@xcite , @xmath104 here @xmath105 . with these elements",
    ", the decay amplitude can be calculated analytically under the simple harmonic oscillator wavefunction approximation following the procedure for the calculation of widths in ref.@xcite .",
    "the amplitudes for @xmath106 , @xmath45 etc are derived by using the harmonic oscillation parameter @xmath48 of the outing mesons .",
    "the overall normalization factor @xmath107 was phenomenologically found to be equal to 0.64 for creating light quark pairs@xcite .",
    "we take the string tension @xmath108 , and the constitute quark mass @xmath109gev , @xmath110gev . as usual , the estimate value @xmath111 and @xmath112 is used , a detailed discussion about these quantity can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the mesons masses are chosen in the same way as in the above @xmath3 model case .",
    "the numerical values for the partial decay width and total width are shown in the third column of table i , where we assume @xmath51gev .",
    "we see that the overall behaviors of the decay modes in flux tube model is similar to those in the @xmath3 model .",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath86 , @xmath72 , @xmath6 , @xmath5 are still the dominant decay modes for @xmath51 gev .",
    "although there is large difference comparing with the @xmath3 model in some channels , such as @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , which is due to the large strange quark mass and the dynamical nodal suppression .",
    "this is strongly supported by the fact that the partial decay width of @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 are similar to those in the @xmath3 model within @xmath119 , even when considering variations in @xmath47 and @xmath88 , where a @xmath2 pair is created from the vacuum .",
    "additional evidence would be that the widths for the @xmath120 and @xmath121 final states(@xmath122 etc ) in the flux tube model would be the same as those in the @xmath3 model within @xmath119 , if we set @xmath123 . for simplicity ,",
    "the effect of @xmath46 is ignored in the above @xmath3 model , following ref.@xcite , whereas this effect is included explicitly in the flux tube model .",
    "a more delicate study of radial strange quarkonium with the mass difference between the original quark and the created quark considered may be necessary to improve the overall agreement between the predictions and experimental data , which has been done for the higher charmonium decay in the @xmath3 model@xcite .",
    "for the interesting @xmath6 mode , @xmath78 is predicted to the dominant as well , and the partial widths ratios are the same as the @xmath3 model results .    in order to illustrate the parameter dependence of the model prediction , we show the @xmath47 dependence of partial width and total width for @xmath1 @xmath2 decay respectively in fig.5 and fig.6 , and the @xmath88 dependence is displayed in fig.7 and fig.8 .",
    "we can see that the @xmath47 and @xmath88 dependence is very similar in the @xmath3 model and the flux tube model , we expect the agreement will be improved further if the effect @xmath46 is considered .",
    "the width is predicted to be around @xmath124mev , which is large than the width of @xmath4 strangeonium hybrid@xcite .",
    "although the predicted decay width is large than present experimental value ( @xmath12 ) , we can not exclude the @xmath1 @xmath2 hypothesis considering the uncertainties of the model and the experimental errors .",

    "@xmath0 has mass that is consistent with @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath9 @xmath2 meson . in this paper",
    ", we examine the possibility that @xmath0 is a @xmath1 @xmath2 meson .",
    "we would like to mention that the @xmath9 @xmath2 state is predicted to be a rather broad state by t.barnes et al .",
    "( please see the last column of table i ) so that it can not be identified with @xmath0@xcite .",
    "we have studied @xmath1 @xmath2 decay from both the @xmath3 model and the flux tube model , and the results are similar in the two models , despite the large difference in some channels .",
    "this is due to large strange quark mass and dynamic nodal suppression .",
    "the agreement will be better , if the mass difference between the origin quarks in the initial state and the created quarks is considered in the @xmath3 model .    it has been found that the difference between the decays of @xmath4 strangeonium hybrid and that of @xmath1 @xmath2 is significant .",
    "for the hybrid suggestion of @xcite , @xmath125 are the main decay channels , and the decay modes of @xmath126 are forbidden . for the @xmath127 scenario discussed in this present paper",
    ", however , the decay modes of @xmath128 should be visible and the corresponding decay widths are large in contrast to the hybrid picture of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that according to the studies in @xcite and the present paper the experimental search of the @xmath0 s decay modes @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 @xmath8 is a criteria to identify the structure of @xmath0 . in the other words ,",
    "if these signals would be observed in the experiment , @xmath0 as a @xmath127 quarkonium is favored , otherwise the interpretation of @xmath0 as a hybrid is preferred . at the present stage , because of the lack of such experimental data , we can not exclude the possibility that @xmath0 is @xmath1 @xmath2 meson .",
    "obviously , it is crucial and significant to detect the @xmath0 s decay modes @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 experimentally in order to identify whether @xmath0 is a @xmath1 @xmath2 quarkonium or an exotic @xmath15 hybrid meson .",
