    "central to many of these investigations is the behavior of matter fields minimally coupled to gauge fields .",
    "several key results in these theories were noted long ago by fradkin and shenker @xcite ( complemented by treatments in @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps the best known result of @xcite is the demonstration that ( when matter fields carry the fundamental unit of charge ) the higgs and confinement phases of gauge theories are smoothly connected to each other and are as different as a liquid is from a gas .",
    "this result remains one of the cornerstones of our understanding of the phases of gauge theories .",
    "although derived long ago , the physical origin of this effect does not seem to be universally agreed upon .    in the current article , we revisit this old result and rederive it for the original @xmath0 theory investigated in @xcite .",
    "our proof relies merely on duality and the lee - yang theorem .",
    "we further illustrate why similar results are anticipated for other gauge theories .",
    "our derivation highlights the origin of this phenomenon as akin to the absence of phase transitions in spin systems in a magnetic field .",
    "notwithstanding the absence of true non - analyticities , some such spin models display a percolation crossover line @xcite at which the surface tension of an oppositely oriented spin cluster vanishes . in this article , we firmly establish the existence of precisely such * a sharp percolation crossover * line for one of the most trivial @xmath0 theories ( the d = 1 + 1 dimensional theory ) .",

    "what follows , we focus for concreteness on @xmath99 ( or @xmath100 ) theories .",
    "first , we note that along the @xmath79 axis , the pure non - interacting links in the effective magnetic field @xmath17 ( leading to @xmath101 [ with @xmath102 a bessel function of order @xmath103 for @xmath104 fields ) display no singularities in the free energy . along the @xmath105 axis , irrespective of the value of @xmath52 , all the gauge invariant bonds @xmath106 in the @xmath99 theory are pinned to 1 .",
    "no transitions occur as @xmath52 is varied along the @xmath107 line as all bond variables are already frozen at their maximally magnetized unit value .",
    "in fact , increasing @xmath52 for finite @xmath17 can only make this magnetization stronger .",
    "the partition function has no dependence on @xmath52 along this line .",
    "thus , we see that in general no phase boundaries can traverse the @xmath105 or the @xmath79 line even in the absence of self - duality and lee - yang results which allow us to make matters more elegant and provide rigorous numerical bounds .",
    "thus , the higgs and confining phases are one and the same for all of these theories .",
    "we must nevertheless mention that in non self dual theories , relying only on the above we can not immediately exclude a transition boundary ending in the bulk at @xmath93 . to exclude this for different individual theories , we need to examine the radius of convergence in @xmath52 .",
    "and @xmath108 axes parameterize the classical two dimensional ising hamiltonian @xmath109 .",
    "the low temperature solid line along the @xmath110 axis denotes the usual first order transition , while the fainter lines denote kertesz transitions .",
    "here , in phase a there is an exponentially rare number of droplets whose spin points opposite to the applied field @xmath108 with a finite surface tension . in phase b , the surface tension of oppositely oriented spin droplets vanishes .",
    "the lines @xmath111 and @xmath112 denote the droplet cluster transition across which the surface tension ( @xmath113 of eq.([kerteq ] ) ) drops to zero.,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ] [ fig ]    ) in @xmath114 dimensions ) as derived from fig.([kertesz ] ) following the duality transformations of eqs.([j1.],[h1 . ] ) .",
    "albeit appearances , this gauge theory has a percolation transition . as we establish here , the two dimensional ising theory of eq.([intro ] ) , by an application of the duality relations of eqs.([j1 . ] , [ h1 . ] ) , a percolation transition separates phase @xmath115 ( spanning the confining regime ) and phase @xmath49 ( which overlaps with the higgs phase ) .",
    "the solid line along the @xmath116 axis signifies the disordered phase of the simple ferromagnet .",
    "( at @xmath117 , eq.([intro ] ) reduces to @xmath118 , the action of a ferromagnet.),title=\"fig:\",width=151 ] [ fig ]    with all stated thus far , it would appear that the single higgs - confining phase is one bulk phase and no transitions occur within it .",
    "we now illustrate that this is not the case- at least not within the simplest of all matter coupled lattice gauge theories- the two dimensional @xmath0 theory which we now show to possess a richer phase diagram than anticipated ( a single phase ) . with no matter , as is well known e.g. @xcite , @xcite , the pure two dimensional @xmath1 gauge theory given by the plaquette term of eq.([intro ] ) is equivalent ( by a trivial gauge fix , e.g. @xmath119 on all horizontal bonds in the plane ) to a stack of decoupled one dimensional ising chains ( all of which are horizontal ising chains formed by the vertical bonds in the gauge alluded to here ) .",
    "as ising chains are disordered at any finite coupling , the two dimensional @xmath1 gauge theory is always confining .",
    "now let us introduce matter coupling ( a finite @xmath17 in eq.([intro ] ) ) and consider the following thought experiment : we color every appearance of @xmath120 in the two dimensional @xmath0 theory by one of two colors and ask ourselves whether the bonds of a uniform sign ( the @xmath121 bonds for @xmath19 ) percolate , upon a trivial mapping , across the sample and if so whether a transition between a percolative and non - percolative clusters can exist within the single higgs - confining phase .",
    "although this question is very general , we can make easy progress and establish rigorous results by relying on the exact duality of eqs.([j1.],[h1 . ] ) to the well studied model of a two dimensional ising magnet in a magnetic field .",
    "some time ago , kertesz argued @xcite that although there might not be ( via the lee - yang theorem ) any thermodynamic singularities in various spin models when subjected to an external magnetic field , sharp crossovers related to vanishing surface tension ( of droplets of oppositely oriented spins ) and a change of character of the high field series ( for quantities such as the free energy or magnetization ) occur .",
    "as is well established by now , this crossover may be discerned by the percolation of clusters constructed via the fortuin - kastelyn representation @xcite .",
    "we would like to suggest that the massive character of the photons in the confining / higgs regimes may reflect such a difference . here",
    ", the spins of @xcite are replaced by a functional of the gauge invariant meson variables @xmath122 .",
    "for the 1 + 1 dimensional @xmath0 theory , we now readily establish this result : by eqs.([j1.],[h1 . ] ) , the d=1 + 1 dimensional @xmath0 theory may be directly mapped to a two dimensional ising model in a magnetic field given by eq.([lye ] ) . however , as established by @xcite the two dimensional ising model in a magnetic field displays a kertesz line . in general dimension",

    "although for any finite @xmath108 , the radius of convergence in @xmath131 is finite ( as indeed no transitions occur by the lee - yang theorem ) , the radius of convergence increases across the percolation line ( appearing as jumps in @xcite ) . for couplings",
