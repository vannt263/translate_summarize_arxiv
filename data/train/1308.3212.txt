    "since the discovery of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 ( lao / sto ) interface ,  @xcite oxide heterostructures have attracted renewed attention .",
    "@xcite in addition to having high carrier densities  @xcite ( @xmath1 /@xmath2 ) with mobilities as high as @xmath3 @xmath2/(v@xmath4s ) ,  @xcite such a 2deg is also the host to a wide variety of electronic phenomena , including superconductivity ,  @xcite magnetism ,  @xcite and rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "@xcite these phenomena , together with the demonstrated tunability of interface conductivity through electric ,  @xcite chemical and photosensitive means ,  @xcite offer promising potential for device applications with novel functionality .",
    "@xcite as a first step , it is imperative to understand the nature and the origin of the 2deg .    in the lao / sto system , it is now generally accepted that the _ intrinsic _ 2deg behavior is driven by the polarization discontinuity between the non - polar sto substrate and the polar lao film .",
    "@xcite along the [ 001 ] direction , the lao film consists of alternating layers of ( lao)@xmath5 and ( alo@xmath6)@xmath7 , which leads to a divergent electrostatic potential , i.e. , the so - called polar catastrophe",
    ". electronic reconstruction ,  @xcite which is facilitated by the presence of transition metal ions , and polar distortions ,  @xcite are the two main competing mechanisms that counter this divergent potential .",
    "while polar distortions screen the electrons at the interface or surface , thereby partially compensating for the polar catastrophe , electronic reconstruction cancels the divergent potential through a transfer of charge between the interface and the surface , with the excess charge partially occupying the ti @xmath8 states , giving rise to a 2deg . as such ,",
    "a fundamental understanding of how these two effects compete with each other is important for tuning the properties of 2degs at oxide heterointerfaces .    motivated by the above question ,",
    "in this article we investigate the surface electronic structure of sto ( 111 ) slabs . along the [ 111 ] direction ,",
    "a sto slab consists of alternating stacks of nominally charged ( ti)@xmath9 and ( sro@xmath0)@xmath10 layers , which already lead to a divergent electrostatic potential , even in the absence of a lao overlayer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : unrelax ] ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to a sto ( 001 ) slab , which consists of alternating charge neutral layers of sro and tio@xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , the presence of multivalent transition metal ions ( ti ) suggests that electronic reconstruction can also take place in sto ( 111 ) .",
    "hence , sto ( 111 ) slabs offer us a unique opportunity for studying both the polar distortion and electronic reconstruction in a chemically homogeneous system .",
    "our work is also relevant to the recent experimental and theoretical progress on oxide ( 111 ) interfaces and surfaces .",
    "experimental studies have reported the growth of ti - rich sto ( 111 ) surface  @xcite and the creation of 2degs at ( 111 ) interfaces in the lao / sto system , with carrier densities comparable to the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "@xcite theoretically , exotic topological phases such as the quantum spin hall state have also been predicted for cubic perovskite ( 111 ) bilayers .",
    "@xcite understanding the surface electronic properties of the sto ( 111 ) slabs will have important implications for these phenomena as well .",
    "using density functional theory ( dft ) , we study sto ( 111 ) slabs of various thicknesses and different surface terminations . we show that for ti - terminated sto slabs ( figs .",
    "[ fig : globfig]a and  [ fig : globfig]b ) it is indeed possible to create a 2deg",
    ". however , the carrier density of the 2deg displays a strong thickness dependence due to the competition between electronic reconstruction and polar distortion .",
    "our calculations suggest that relatively thick slabs ( @xmath11 layers ) are required to reach the ideal carrier density ( 2 electrons / surface unit cell ) expected from the nominal charge counting argument .",
    "in contrast , we find that the tio - terminated slab ( figs .  [",
    "fig : globfig]c and  [ fig : globfig]d ) exhibits no charge transfer to the surface .",
    "this is because the surface oxygen functions to nullify any potential that could develop across the sto slab .",
    "a thermodynamic stability analysis shows that the ti - terminated sto slab can be stable , albeit within a very narrow region of phase space .",
    "our results show that both electronic reconstruction and polar distortions must be taken into account when analyzing the 2deg behavior for ( 111 ) and ( 110 ) interfaces .",
    "in this work we examine sto ( 111 ) slabs with various thickness and two surface terminations : ti ( top)/sro@xmath0 ( bottom)-terminated ( referred to as ti - terminated ) and tio(top)/sro@xmath6(bottom ) terminated ( referred to as tio - terminated ) . both are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : globfig ] .",
    "the electronic ground - state calculations were performed using dft with the local density approximation ( lda ) for exchange and correlation as implemented in the quantum espresso simulation package .",

    "@xcite for all calculations , a hubbard @xmath15 = 5 ev for ti @xmath16 states was found to be appropriate .",

    "we first consider the ideal ti - terminated sto ( 111 ) slab , which consists of alternating stacks of ti and sro@xmath0 layers with nominal charges of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : stoichiometryldos]a shows the typical layer - projected dos for a slab with 6 layers of srtio@xmath0 unit .",
    "we observe the occurrence of a surface metallic state for the top surface layer ( ti surface ) .",
    "this is similar to the results for the sto ( 110 ) surface@xcite and with previous semi - empirical hartree - fock calculations for the sto ( 111 ) surface.@xcite the atomic projected dos indicates that these surface states are comprised mainly of ti @xmath25 and @xmath16 orbitals .",
    "the excess electrons are derived from the depletion of the valence band of the bottom layer due to the depopulation of o @xmath22 orbitals .",
    "this can be clearly seen from the orbital dependent electronic band structure , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stoichiometryldos]b .",
    "the dispersive energy bands clearly indicate that those excess charges are mobile carriers .",
    "the number of excess electrons ( holes ) at the surface is obtained by performing an integration of the layer - averaged orbital projected dos in a small neighborhood below ( above ) the fermi level .",
    "@xcite ( n.b . this typically underestimates the electron count relative to the total dos by @xmath180.1 e@xmath7 . ) for the 6-layer slab , we found a total transfer of 0.7 electrons per surface unit cell .",
    "however , if electronic reconstruction is the only working mechanism , nominal charge counting dictates that there should be two electrons per unit cell transferred from the sro@xmath0 surface to the ti surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : unrelax]c ) .",
    "this is a strong indication of the vital role polar distortions  @xcite play in avoiding the polar catastrophe in oxide heterostructures .",
    "@xcite .    to analyze the effect of the polar distortions",
    ", we have calculated the total transferred charge between the surface layers for different layer thicknesses for both the relaxed and the unrelaxed systems ( fig .  [",
    "fig : totalchg ] ) .",
    "there are two main features .",
    "first , there is a critical thickness ( 3 layers ) above which electronic reconstruction between the surfaces takes place , as indicated by the appearance of a 2deg .",
    "second , we observe a smooth increase in transferred charge with a thickness dependence for the relaxed system , which is in sharp contrast to the abrupt increase of transferred charge with very little thickness dependence for the unrelaxed system .",
    "we also note that for the unrelaxed structure , the transferred charge is very close to 2 electrons per unit cell .",
    "( color online ) the total charge transferred between the surfaces as a function of thickness for relaxed ( red ) and unrelaxed ( black ) system . ]    the origin of the critical thickness can be explained by comparing this situation to the lao / sto ( 001 ) heterostructure counterpart .",
    "it is well established that for these systems above an overlayer thickness of 3 layers , there is an occurrence of a 2deg.@xcite there the polar catastrophe is built up in the lao overlayer and electronic reconstruction occurs when the divergent potential exceeds the band gap of sto .",
    "a similar effect occurs for the sto ( 111 ) slab .",
    "when the slab is thick enough to make the divergence in potential comparable to the band gap an electronic reconstruction occurs .",
    "this is clearly seen in our results for the unrelaxed surfaces ( fig .",
    "[ fig : totalchg ] ) . in these systems",
    ", we observe a transfer of two electrons between the surfaces once the layer thickness is beyond a critical thickness of 2 layers .",
    "this is very abrupt and as immediate as the closing of the band gap and is a consequence of the fact that the electronic reconstruction is the only mechanism available for countering the polar catastrophe in the unrelaxed slabs .",
    "more interestingly , the thickness dependence of the magnitude of the charge transfer can be attributed to the effect of polar distortions .",
    "figures  [ fig : pd1]a  and  [ fig : pd1]b depict the layer - by - layer off - center ( polar ) distortions , @xmath26 , of sr and ti atoms , respectively , for ti - terminated slabs of varying sto thicknesses .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : pd1 ] , the net effect of the ( 111 ) surface geometry and the ti - termination is to polarize the individual layers of sro@xmath0 and ti layers relative to their respective oxygen cages . for all slab thicknesses",
    ", we find that in the middle of the slab there is a nearly constant shift of ti and sr relative to their corresponding oxygen layers , with the magnitude of the displacements decreasing with slab thickness .",
    "more important are the large off - center displacements for the surface ti cations . figure  [ fig : pd1]c shows a schematic of the effect of relaxation for 6 layers of the ti - terminated sto slab with the percentage relaxation calculated which emphasizes the large surface distortions ( n.b .",
    "these large relaxations are similar to other oxides ) .",
    "the net effect of such surface dipoles is to counter the divergent potential across the slab . as the thickness of the slabs increase , however , we observe a decrease in the magnitude of these distortions . below three layers the polar distortions are able to completely cancel out the polar catastrophe . as the thickness",
    "is increased , it becomes more energetically favorable to have an increase in the transferred charge and a decrease in polar distortion .",
    "we infer from the trend in fig .",
    "[ fig : totalchg ] that for very thick sto slabs , the total amount of transferred electrons will converge to two electrons per unit cell after relaxation , just like in the case of the unrelaxed system .",
    "the competition between the electronic reconstruction and polar distortion is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : unrelax ] .",

    "( b ) off - centering of ti relative to planes of o anions above and below ti . surface ti off - centering is computed relative to bulk positions .",
    "( c ) a schematic of the effect of relaxation for the case of ti - termination with 6 layers of sto . ]",
    "next we consider the tio - termination of the sto ( 111 ) slab , which is made by transferring one o atom from the bottom sro@xmath0 terminated surface to the top ti terminated surface , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : globfig]c and d. when we remove one o atom from the sro@xmath0 layer , the 6 identical o sites around the sr atom are broken into a group of 4 identical sites and 2 identical o \" vacant  sites . to identify the most stable location for placing the o atom on the ti termination , we compared the energies of 5 possible high symmetry sites as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : globfig]c , and found that the o vacant site ( 1 ) is the preferred site .",
    "we are interested in this situation because according to the polar catastrophe argument , one should not expect any significant electron transfer between the surfaces as the transfer of one o atom between the surfaces should stabilize the system .",
    "an analysis of the total dos ( see total dos for 6 layers of sto in fig .  [",
    "fig : odtdos ] ) confirms that the system is indeed insulating for all sto layer thicknesses studied ( @xmath28 6 , 9 , 12 ) .",

    "( top ) split between sr and o@xmath0 in sro@xmath0 layers .",
    "( bottom ) off - centering of ti relative to planes of o anions above and below ti . ]    from this we note that there is no charge transfer between any bulk layers , similar to the ti - terminated case .",
    "nevertheless , we find a striking difference between the tio- and ti - terminated surfaces .",
    "in particular , in the case of the tio - terminated surfaces there are no electrons transferred between the surface layers . here",
    ", the polar catastrophe is avoided without any contribution from electronic reconstruction , unlike the case of the ti - termination .    the atomic relaxation for each sto layer for different layer thickness of sto for the tio - termination is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd2 ] .",
    "here we see that , unlike the ti - terminated slabs , the bulk ti and sr cations exhibit negligible off - center displacements .",
    "such displacements are indicative of having a reduced electric potential across the slab .",
    "however a larger polar distortion develops on the topmost plane of ti ions , which is a local relaxation effect . to conclude , the effect of polar distortion in this case is much less compared to the ti - termination ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pd1 ] ) as the transfer of one oxygen atom is effective in screening the polarization , with the help of some local relaxation .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation of the lack of charge transfer for different thicknesses for this system .",
    "the imminent question is the relative thermodynamic stability of these different surface terminations . in this section",
    "we analyze the thermodynamic stability of the various terminations of the sto ( 111 ) surface , following the formalism proposed by f. bottin _ et.al .",
    "_  @xcite the energy required to split a crystal in half with complementary surfaces is called the cleavage energy . the cleavage energy ( e@xmath29 ) per surface area for the unrelaxed ti / sro@xmath30 terminations and unrelaxed tio / sro@xmath31 terminations respectively are defined in the following @xmath32    where e@xmath33 stands for the total energy of the bulk sto system , _",

    "it should be noted that for the sto ( 111 ) surface a stable ti - rich surface has already been observed ( albeit without any knowledge of o content).@xcite nevertheless , these results highlight the possibility of creating the ti - terminated surface and may have specific consequences for the electronic states that could be created at a heterostructure interface .",
    "in summary , we have studied sto ( 111 ) slabs of various thicknesses and different surface terminations using density functional theory .",
    "we observe that for the ti - sro@xmath0 terminated sto ( 111 ) slab there is charge redistribution which is dominated by the transfer of electrons from the sro@xmath0 terminated surface to the ti surface , giving rise to a metallic surface states for this configuration .",
    "the carrier density of the 2degs display a strong thickness dependence due to the competition between electronic reconstruction and polar distortions . in comparison , for the tio - terminated surface , no such surface states exist and the compensation mechanism is dominated by the new surface boundary conditions created by the transfer of an o ion from one surface to the other . by studying the relative stability of these different terminations we observe that the ti termination can indeed be stabilized depending upon the experimental conditions . naturally , the ability to tune the magnitude of charge transfer / compensation at an oxide surface / interface has consequences on numerous applications including surface catalysis and oxide electronics as well as important implications for novel phenomena such superconductivity and magnetism in confined dimensions .",
