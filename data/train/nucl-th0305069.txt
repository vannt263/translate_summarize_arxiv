    "particle interferometry based on the hanbury - brown twiss ( hbt ) effect has been used extensively in heavy ion collisions to extract the information on the emission source of particles @xcite . in particular , the long emission time as a result of the phase transition from the quark - gluon plasma to hadronic matter in relativistic heavy ion collisions may lead to an emission source which has a much larger radius in the direction of the total transverse momentum of detected two particles ( @xmath2 ) than that perpendicular to both this direction and the beam direction ( @xmath3 ) @xcite . since the quark - gluon plasma is expected to be formed in heavy ion collisions at rhic , it is surprising to find that the extracted ratio @xmath4 from a gaussian fit to the measured two - pion correlation function in au+au collisions at @xmath5 gev is close to one @xcite , very different from predictions of hydrodynamical models @xcite .",
    "since particle interferometry probes the phase - space distributions of particles at freeze - out , it is natural to apply transport models to hbt .",
    "the reason is that particle freeze - out is dynamically generated in transport models when the mean - free - path exceeds the system size at later stage of expansion , whereas freeze - out has to be imposed in hydrodynamical models . using a multi - phase transport ( ampt ) model , we have found that the small pion @xmath1 ratio could be due to a large and positive space - time correlation in the emission source @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the pion source at freeze - out is highly non - gaussian , leading to much larger pion source radii than the radius parameters from a gaussian fit to the three - dimensional correlation function .    in this study",
    ", we extend the work of ref.@xcite by studying the kaon interferometry in central au+au collisions at rhic energies . using the ampt model ,",
    "we find that , unlike the pion case , the kaon source radii extracted directly from the emission function are close to the fitted radius parameters extracted from a gaussian fit to the three - dimensional correlation function . our results also show that the kaon emission source has a large and positive correlation between time and position along the @xmath6-direction at freeze - out , similar to what we have found earlier for the pion emission source .",
    "we expect that the study of kaon interferometry , as well as other observables such as the strange hadron elliptic flow , will be useful in understanding the dynamics of strange quarks and hadrons in heavy ion collisions at rhic .",
    "the ampt model is a hybrid model that uses the minijet partons from hard processes and excited strings from soft processes in the hijing model @xcite for the initial condition of relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the time evolution of partons is then described by the zpc @xcite parton cascade model , and that of hadrons by an extended art model @xcite . in the default ampt model , only minijet partons are included in the parton cascade with a parton scattering cross section of @xmath7 mb .",
    "after partons freeze out , they combine with their parent strings and then fragment to hadrons according to the lund string fragmentation as implemented in pythia @xcite .",
    "the default model has been quite reasonable in describing the measured rapidity distributions of charge particles @xcite , particle to antiparticle ratios @xcite , and the spectra of low transverse momentum pions , kaons @xcite , multi - strange baryons @xcite and @xmath8 mesons @xcite in heavy ion collisions at sps and/or rhic .    since the initial energy density in au+au collisions at rhic is expected to be much larger than the critical energy density at which the transition from hadronic matter to quark - gluon plasma would occur @xcite , the ampt model has been extended to allow the conversion of initial excited strings to partons at rhic energies @xcite . in this _ string melting _",
    "scenario , hadrons that would have been produced from string fragmentation are converted instead to valence quarks and/or antiquarks .",
    "interactions among these partons are again described by the zpc parton cascade model .",
    "the transition from the partonic matter to hadronic matter at parton freeze - out is achieved using a simple quark coalescence model by combining two nearest partons into mesons and three nearest partons into baryons ( or anti - baryons ) @xcite . with the energy in excited strings taking part in the early partonic interactions and using quark coalescence to model hadronization ,",
    "the extended ampt model with string melting @xcite is able to describe the observed elliptic flow at rhic @xcite , which the default ampt model failed to reproduce .    at present , the zpc parton cascade @xcite in the ampt model includes only two - parton elastic scatterings .",
    "the in - medium differential cross section is given by @xmath9 , where the effective screening mass @xmath10 in principle depends on the temperature and density of the partonic matter@xcite .",
    "in this study , we take @xmath10 as a parameter in order to study the effect of partonic scatterings .",
    "also , for simplicity , we assume the same scattering cross section for partons of different flavors .",
    "we note , however , that comparisons of high - quality data on the elliptic flow of strange hadrons @xcite with theoretical predictions @xcite is expected to provide very useful information on the interactions of strange quarks in dense matter .",
    "to evaluate the two - kaon correlation function requires the knowledge of the single kaon emission function @xmath11 . in the ampt model , it is obtained from the kaon space - time coordinate @xmath12 and momentum @xmath13 at kinetic freeze - out .",
    "the hbt correlation function for two identical hadrons of momenta @xmath14 and @xmath15 is then given by @xcite @xmath16 } { \\int d^4x_1 s(x_1,{\\bf p_1 } ) \\int d^4x_2 s(x_2,{\\bf p_2 } ) } , \\label{emission}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "expecting that the emission function is sufficiently smooth in momentum space , one can evaluate the correlation function by using @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath19 in the numerator of above equation .",
    "first , the size of the emission source can be extracted from the emission function via the curvature of the correlation function at @xmath20 : @xmath21 in the above , @xmath22 with @xmath23 denotes the average energy of the two kaons ; @xmath24 are spatial coordinates of a kaon at freeze - out ; and @xmath25 with @xmath26 denoting the average value of @xmath12 . in this study",
    "we use the usual `` out - side - long '' ( @xmath27 ) coordinate system @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the measured correlation function @xmath28 is usually fitted by a gaussian function in @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 we note that , for central heavy - ion collisions , the above fitted radius parameters would be identical to the source radii given by the curvature of the emission function at @xmath20 ( i.e. eq .",
    "( [ source ] ) ) only when the emission source is gaussian in space and time .",
    "using the program correlation after burner @xcite , we have evaluated the correlation function @xmath28 of two kaons in their longitudinally comoving frame for central ( @xmath31 fm ) au+au collisions at @xmath32 gev . in figure  1 , we show the invariant correlation function , i.e. , the correlation function as a function of @xmath33 , and its projections onto one of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 axes . in evaluating the projected correlation function ,",
    "the other two @xmath29-components have been integrated over the range @xmath36 mev/@xmath37 .",
    "the dash - dotted curves in figure  1 represent results from the default ampt model ( no string melting ) , while the other curves are from the extended ampt model with string melting but using different values for @xmath38 .",
    "it is seen that the one - dimensional kaon correlation functions become narrower as @xmath39 is increased in the extended ampt model .",
    "their dependence on @xmath39 seems , however , to be much weaker than that of the pion correlation function @xcite .",
    "the source radii for kaons within @xmath40 and @xmath41 mev@xmath42 are shown in figure  2 ( a ) .",
    "the results are obtained from both the default ampt model ( shown at @xmath43 ) and the extended ampt model with string melting . for the latter ,",
    "we have used different parton cross sections of @xmath44 , 6 , 10 , and 15 mb .",
    "it is seen that these radii have values between 2 and 5 fm , and they are much smaller than the source radii for low @xmath45 pions ( between 7 and 25 fm ) @xcite . the @xmath1 ratio ( solid curves without symbols ) from the kaon emission function",
    "is also shown in figure  2 ( a ) , and it increases appreciably with increasing parton scattering cross section .    [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     figure  3 ( a ) shows the extended ampt results with @xmath46 mb for kaon source radii as functions of @xmath47 in the six @xmath45-bins , @xmath48 gev@xmath42 , for au+au collisions at @xmath5 gev .",
    "we see that for all @xmath47 the source radii ( solid ) are close to the corresponding fitted radius parameters ( filled squares ) .",
    "we note that , before making quantitative predictions on kaon correlations , abundances of strange resonances such as @xmath49 and @xmath8 need to be checked , and the effects of other resonances not yet included in the ampt model also need to be investigated .",
    "figure  3 ( b ) and ( c ) show the @xmath51 and @xmath52 distributions at freeze - out for @xmath53 with @xmath41 mev@xmath42 and @xmath40 .",
    "the kaon emission source shows a positive shift in @xmath54 as in the pion case @xcite , consistent with a strong transverse flow .",
    "the emission source also appears to be highly non - gaussian , which leads to different values of radius parameters extracted from the two methods in section  [ khbt ] @xcite .",
    "the solid curve with open diamonds in figure  3 ( c ) gives the average value @xmath55 as a function of freeze - out time @xmath56 .",
    "the kaon emission source is seen to have a strong positive @xmath57 correlation as in the pion emission source @xcite .    since @xmath58 , but @xmath59 the ratio @xmath4 contains information about the duration of emission ( in the last term ) and has been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that a direct relation between @xmath2 and the emission duration exists only if the @xmath57 correlation term @xmath60 is small , which is not the case according to our results from the extended ampt .",
    "e.g , the above equation for the kaons is numerically written as @xmath61 in units of @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath57 correlation term @xmath60 is thus positive ( @xmath63 @xmath62 ) and comparable to the magnitude of @xmath64 ( @xmath65 @xmath62 ) , making it difficult to extract information about the duration of emission from @xmath4 .",
    "the situation is similar for the pion emission source , e.g. , for mid - rapidity pions with @xmath66 mev@xmath42 , numerically the corresponding eq .",
    "( [ rout ] ) is @xmath67 in units of @xmath62 .",
    "figure  4 shows the correlation functions for both neutral and charged kaons within @xmath40 and @xmath41 mev@xmath42 from ampt model with string melting and @xmath46 mb for @xmath5 and @xmath68 gev .",
    "the effect due to coulomb interactions is included for @xmath69 correlation functions using the program correlation after burner @xcite .",
    "the kaon correlation functions are found to change only slightly from @xmath70 to @xmath68 gev at rhic .",
