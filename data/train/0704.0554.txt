    "the knowledge of the properties of highly compressed and heated hadronic matter is an important issue for the understanding of astrophysical processes , such as the mechanism of supernovae explosions and the physics of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "heavy ion collisions provide the unique opportunity to explore highly excited hadronic matter , i.e. the high density behavior of the nuclear eos , under controlled conditions ( high baryon energy densities and temperatures ) in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "of particular recent interest is also the still poorly known density dependence of the isovector channel of the eos .",
    "suggested observables have been the nucleon collective flows @xcite and the distributions of produced particles such as pions and , in particular , particles with strangeness ( kaons ) @xcite .",
    "because of the rather high energy threshold ( @xmath7 gev for nucleon - nucleon collisions ) , kaon production in hics at energies in the range @xmath8 is mainly due to secondary processes involving @xmath9 resonances and pions ( @xmath10 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "secondary processes require high baryon density .",
    "this explains why the kaon production around threshold is intimately connected to the high density stage of the nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "furthermore , the relatively large mean free path of positive charged ( @xmath4 ) and neutral ( @xmath5 ) kaons inside the hadronic environment causes hadronic matter to be transparent for kaons @xcite .",
    "therefore kaon yields and generally _ strangeness ratios _ have been proposed as important signals for the investigation of the high density behavior of the nuclear eos .",
    "this idea , as firstly suggested by aichelin and ko @xcite , has been recently applied in hic at intermediate energies in terms of strangeness ratios , e.g. the ratio of the kaon yields in au+au and c+c collisions @xcite . in these studies",
    "it was found that this ratio is very sensitive to the stiffness of the nuclear eos .",
    "indeed comparisons with kaos data @xcite favored a soft behavior of the high density nuclear eos , a statement which is particularly consistent with elliptic flow data of the fopi collaboration @xcite .",
    "the idea of studying particle ratios in hics around the kinematical threshold has been recently applied in the determination of the isovector channel of the nuclear eos , i.e. the high density dependence of the symmetry energy @xmath11 .",
    "it has turned out that particle ratios , such as @xmath2 @xcite or @xmath3 @xcite , are sensitive to the stiffness of the symmetry energy and , in particular to the strength of the vector isovector field . however in medium effects on the kaon propagation have been neglected so far . here",
    "we will test the robustness of the yield ratio against the inclusion and the variation of the corresponding kaon potentials .",
    "at the same time in ref .",
    "@xcite the role of the in - medium modifications of nn cross sections has been studied in terms of baryon and strangeness dynamics .",
    "it was found that the pion and kaon yields are sensitively influenced by the reduced effective nn cross sections for inelastic processes . here",
    "we will see that the kaon yield ratio appears robust even with respect to the density dependence of the in - medium inelastic nn cross sections , while at variance the pion ratio seems to be more sensitive .",
    "the collision dynamics is rather complex and involves the nuclear mean field ( eos ) and binary @xmath12-body collisions . in the presence of a nuclear medium the treatment of binary collisions represents a non - trivial problem .",
    "the nn cross sections for elastic and inelastic processes , which are the crucial physical parameters here , are experimentally accessible only in free space and not for @xmath12-body scattering at finite baryon density .",
    "recent microscopic studies , based on the @xmath13-matrix approach , have shown a strong decrease of the elastic nn cross section @xcite in a hadronic medium .",
    "these in - medium effects of the elastic nn cross section considerably influence the hadronic reaction dynamics @xcite .",
    "obviously the question arises whether similar in - medium effects of the _ inelastic _ nn cross sections may affect the reaction dynamics and , in particular , the production of particles ( pions and kaons ) .",
    "furthermore , the strangeness propagation inside the nuclear medium is even more complex and involves the additional consideration of kaon mean field potentials in the dynamical description .",
    "this is an important issue when comparing with experimental kaon data @xcite . in a chiral perturbation approach at the lowest order ( chpt potentials )",
    ", the kaon ( antikaon ) potential has an attractive scalar and a repulsive ( attractive ) vector part @xcite .",
    "this leads to weakly repulsive ( strongly attractive ) potentials for kaons ( antikaons ) with corresponding scalar and vector kaon - nucleon coupling constants depending on the parametrization @xcite accounted for .",
    "similar results can be obtained in an effective meson - coupling model ( obe potentials , in the rmf spirit ) , where the @xmath14-meson couplings are simply related to the nucleon - meson ones , in the spirit of ref .",
    "the latter approach has the advantage of being fully consistent with the covariant transport equations used to simulate the reaction dynamics @xcite .",
    "we remind that the high density dependence of the kaon self energies is still an object of current debate , e.g. see refs .",
    "@xcite in which the role of the kaon potential has been investigated in terms of kaon in - plane and out - of - plane flows .",
    "moreover for studies aimed to the determination of the symmetry energy from strangeness production one has to consider with particular care the isospin dependence of the kaon mean field potential .",
    "the main focus of the present work is on a detailed study of the _ robustness _ of the pionic @xmath2 and , in particular , the strangeness ratio @xmath3 with respect to the in - medium modifications of the imaginary part of the nucleon self energy , i.e. the nn cross sections , and to the in - medium variations of the kaon self energy , i.e. the density dependence of the kaon potential .",
    "this analysis , which goes beyond our previous investigations of @xcite , is also motivated by new measurements of the fopi collaboration @xcite by means of the strangeness ratios .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the next section describes the theoretical treatment of the reaction dynamics within the relativistic boltzmann - uheling - uhlenbeck ( rbuu ) transport equation .",
    "a detailed discussion on the in - medium modifications of the inelastic nn cross sections is presented . in section 3",
    "we discuss the kaon mean field potentials ( in both chpt and obe / rmf schemes ) and their expected isospin dependence .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a short introduction to the dynamical calculations .",
    "results are then shown in section 5 , mostly for central @xmath15 collisions at @xmath16 , in terms of pion and kaon yields .",
    "the initial presentation of the _ absolute _ yields is relevant for a detailed discussion as well as for a comparison with theoretical results of other groups and with experimental data of the kaos and fopi collaborations .",
    "all together this intermediate step is important for testing the reliability of the calculations , since ratios do not do it .",
    "finally we present the pion and strangeness ratios and discuss their dependence on the in - medium modifications of the cross nn cross sections and of the kaon potentials , including the isospin effects . in section 6",
    "we conclude with a summary and some general comments and perspectives .",
    "in this chapter we briefly discuss the transport equation focusing on the treatment of two features important for kaon dynamics : ( a ) the collision integral by means of the cross sections ; ( b ) the kaon mean field potential and its isospin dependence .",
    "the theoretical description of hics is based on the semiclassical kinetic theory of statistical mechanics , i.e. the boltzmann equation with the uehling - uhlenbeck modification of the collision integral @xcite .",

    "the attractive scalar field @xmath22 enters via the effective mass @xmath23 and the repulsive vector field @xmath24 via the kinetic momenta @xmath25 and via the field tensor @xmath26 .",
    "the dynamical description according to eq.([rbuu ] ) involves the strangeness propagation in the nuclear medium .",

    "( 8.,7.3 ) ( 3.0,0.3 )    in the kinetic equation ( [ rbuu ] ) both physical input quantities , the mean field ( eos ) and the collision integral ( cross sections ) should be derived from the same underlying effective two - body interaction in the medium , i.e. the in - medium t - matrix ; @xmath29 , respectively . however , in most practical applications phenomenological mean fields and cross sections have been used . in such approach",
    "the strategy is to adjust to the known bulk properties of nuclear matter around the saturation point , and to try to constrain the models at supra - normal densities with the help of heavy ion reactions @xcite .",
    "medium modifications of the nn cross sections are usually not taken into account . in spite of that for several observables the comparison to experimental data appears to work astonishingly well @xcite .",
    "however , in particular kinematical regimes a sensitivity to the elastic nn cross sections of dynamical observables , such as collective flows and stopping @xcite or transverse energy transfer @xcite , has been observed .",
    "microscopic dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) studies for nuclear matter above the fermi energy regime show a strong density dependence of the elastic @xcite and inelastic @xcite nn cross sections . in such studies",
    "one starts from the bare nn - interaction in the spirit of the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) model by fitting the parameters to empirical nucleon - nucleus scattering and solves then the equations of the nuclear matter many body problem in the @xmath28-matrix or ladder approximation .",
    "it is not the aim of the present work to go into further details on this topic .",
    "an important feature of such microscopic calculations is the inclusion of the pauli - blocking effect in the _ intermediate _ scattering states of the @xmath28-matrix elements and their in - medium modifications , i.e. the density dependence of the nucleon mass and momenta .",
    "here of particular interest are the in - medium modifications of the inelastic nn cross sections since they directly influence the production mechanism of resonances and thus the creation of pions and kaons according to the channels listed later ( see sect.3 ) .",
    "dbhf studies on inelastic nn cross sections are rare and in limited regions of density and momentum @xcite .",
    "for this reason we will first discuss in the following the in - medium dependence of the elastic nn cross sections , which will be then used as a starting basis for a detailed analysis of the density dependence of the inelastic nn cross sections .    the microscopic in - medium dependence of the elastic cross sections can be seen in fig .",

    "these results are obtained from relativistic dirac - brueckner calculations @xcite .",
    "the presence of the medium leads to a substantial suppression of the cross section which is most pronounced at low laboratory energy @xmath34 and high densities where the pauli - blocking of intermediate states is most efficient . at larger @xmath34 asymptotic values of 15 - 20 mb",
    "are reached .",
    "also the angular distributions are affected by the presence of the medium .",
    "e.g. the initially strongly forward - backward peaked @xmath35 cross sections become much more isotropic at finite densities , mainly due to the pauli suppression of intermediate soft modes ( @xmath10-exchange ) @xcite . as a consequence",
    "a larger transverse energy transfer can be expected .",
    "the case of the inelastic nn cross sections is similar , but more complicated .",
    "the presence of the medium influences not only the matrix elements , but also the threshold energy @xmath36 , which is an important quantity at beam energies below or near the threshold of particle production . in free space it is calculated from the invariant quantity @xmath37 with @xmath38 the @xmath39-momenta of the two particles in the ingoing collision channel , e.g. @xmath40 .",
    "this quantity is conserved in binary collisions in free space , from which one determines the modulus of the momenta of the particles in the outgoing channel .",
    "the threshold condition reads @xmath41 .",
    "cross sections in free space are usually parametrized in terms of @xmath42 or the corresponding momentum in the laboratory system @xmath43 within the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) model , see e.g. @xcite for details .",
    "at finite density , however , particles carry kinetic momenta and effective masses and obey a dispersion relation @xmath44 modified with respect to the free case .",
    "these in - medium effects shift the threshold energy in the free space according to @xmath45 and the threshold condition for inelastic processes inside the medium reads now @xmath46 . the requirement of energy - momentum conservation can be carried out in terms of the quantity @xmath47",
    "@xmath48 @xmath49 , @xmath50 as long as the in - medium mean fields or the corresponding self energies do not change between ingoing and outgoing channels .",
    "the application of free parametrizations of cross sections for inelastic processes in dynamical situations of hics at finite density leads thus to an inconsistency , since the threshold condition is performed in terms of effective quantities , but the matrix elements are carried out in free space , e.g. by fitting their parameters to free empirical nn scattering .",
    "this effect can be seen in fig .",

    "the corresponding threshold value of the laboratory energy @xmath56 is @xmath57 gev . however , at finite density the threshold is shifted towards lower energies , i.e. the free cross section increases , due to the reduction of the free masses of the outgoing particles in the threshold condition @xmath58 .",
    "obviously at higher energies far from threshold the free cross section does not depend on the density .",
    "a more consistent approach is the determination of the inelastic cross section under the consideration of in - medium effects , i.e. the pauli - blocking of intermediate scattering states and in - medium modified spinors in the determination of the matrix elements within the obe model .",
    "a simultaneous treatment of the transport equation and the structure equations of dbhf for actual anisotropic momentum configurations is not possible , due to its high complexity .",
    "for this reason we have applied the same method as for the case of elastic binary processes , i.e. in - medium parametrizations of the _ inelastic _ cross sections of the type @xmath40 within the same underlying dbhf approach as already used for the elastic processes .",
    "haar and malfliet @xcite investigated this topic for infinite nuclear matter with the result of a strong in - medium modification of the inelastic cross sections due to the reasons given above .",
    "however , these studies were performed at various densities but only in a limited region of momenta .",
    "for a practical application in hics we have thus extended these dbhf calculations using an extrapolation technique .",
    "we have imposed an exponential decay law of the form @xmath59 on the values of the in - medium cross sections of the channel @xmath60 given in ref .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 normalizes to the last value of the extrapolated cross section and @xmath62 is defined by fitting the slope of the free cross section , since it does not change with density . for the density dependence",
    "we have enforced a correction of the form @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , with @xmath65 saturation density , are extracted from the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "the same modification is imposed on the cross sections of all the inelastic channels , in a form of the type @xmath66 , with @xmath67 taken from the standard free parametrizations of ref . @xcite .",
    "such a procedure is well appropriate at low energies but at higher momenta can be less accurate .",

    "more suitable results would come from a dbhf approach to isospin asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "only recently such studies have been started @xcite , however , limiting to low momenta regions , below the threshold energy of inelastic channels .",
    "before starting with the presentation of the results , it is important to analyse the in - medium kaon potential , since it could be relevant when theoretical results will be compared with experiments .",
    "in fact it has been widely discussed whether the kaon potential plays a crucial role in describing kaon production and their dynamics @xcite .",

    "the results are in good agreement and this is not surprising on the basis of a simple physics argument .",
    "it is well established @xcite that kaons ( @xmath70 ) feel a weak repulsive potential in nuclear matter , of the order of @xmath71 at normal density .",
    "this can be described as the net result of the cancellation of an attractive scalar and a repulsive vector interaction terms .",

    "the effects of the in medium kaon potentials are also largely compensating in the @xmath94 yield ratio , due to the similar repulsive field seen by @xmath5 and @xmath4 mesons .",
    "such a result can be modified by the isospin dependence of the kaon potentials which is expected to act in opposite directions for neutral and charged kaons rates .",
    "actually this is a rather stimulating open problem . in our analysis with two completely different approaches , @xmath68 vs. @xmath96",
    ", we get a good agreement for the isoscalar kaon potential but a rather different prediction for the isovector part .",
    "however , a study in terms of the different choices of the isovector kaon field has shown that the relative dependence of the strangeness ratios on the stiffness of the isovector nuclear eos remains a well robust observable .",
    "this is an important issue in determining the high density behavior of the symmetry energy in more systematic analyses in the future , when more experimental data will be available .",
