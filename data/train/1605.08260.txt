    "we denote by @xmath8 the ( weak ) @xmath9 partial derivative of a locally integrable function @xmath10 , and by @xmath11 the ( weak ) gradient .",
    "then for @xmath12 we define the sobolev space as @xmath13 with the norm @xmath14 for @xmath15 , and @xmath16    it is a fundamental property of sobolev spaces that smooth functions defined in @xmath1 are dense in @xmath17 for any domain @xmath0 when @xmath15 .",
    "if each function in @xmath17 is the restriction of a function in @xmath18 one can then obviously use global smooth functions to approximate functions in @xmath19 .",
    "this is in particular the case for lipschitz domains .",

    "more recently , in @xcite it was shown by giacomini and trebeschi that , for bounded simply connected planar domains , @xmath22 is dense in @xmath3 for all @xmath23 .",
    "motivated by the results above , koskela and zhang proved in @xcite that for any bounded simply connected domain and any @xmath4 , @xmath2 is dense in @xmath3 , and @xmath20 is dense in @xmath3 when @xmath1 is jordan .    in this paper , we extend the main idea in @xcite so as to handle both multiply connected and higher dimensional settings .",
    "it turns out that simply connectivity ( or trivial topology ) is not sufficient for approximation results in higher dimensions .",
    "[ example ] given @xmath24 , there is a bounded domain @xmath25 homeomorphic to the unit ball via a locally bi - lipschitz homeomorphism , such that @xmath26 is not dense in @xmath3 for any @xmath27 .",
    "recall that @xmath28 is locally bi - lipschitz if for every compact set @xmath29 there exists @xmath30 such that for all @xmath31 @xmath32    the above example shows that the planar setting is very special .",
    "the crucial point is that a simply connected planar domain is conformally equivalent ( by the riemann mapping theorem ) to the unit disk , and conformal equivalence is in general much more restrictive than topological equivalence .",
    "one could then ask if the planar approximation results extend to hold for those spatial domains that are conformally equivalent to the unit ball .",
    "this is trivially the case since the liouville theorem implies that such a domain is necessarily a ball or a half - space .",
    "a bit of thought reveals that bi - lipschitz equivalence is also sufficient .",
    "our results below imply that bi - lipschitz equivalence can be relaxed to quasiconformal equivalence to the unit ball or even to quasiconformal equivalence to a uniform domain , a natural class of domains in the study of ( quasi)conformal geometry .    in order to state our main result",

    "we give some preliminaries .",
    "after this we decompose a bounded domain @xmath1 ( which is @xmath39-gromov hyperbolic with respect to the quasihyperbolic metric ) into several parts via lemma  [ eqdef ] , and then construct a corresponding partition of unity . in @xcite conformal mappings and planar geometry were applied to obtain the desired composition . in our setting , we can not rely on mappings nor on simple geometry . instead of this",
    "we employ two characterizing properties of gromov hyperbolicity : the ball - separation condition and the gehring - hayman inequality ; see lemma  [ eqdef ] below .",
