    "@xcite , that in the presence of an oscillating magnetic field , the ionization rate of a hydrogen atom interacting with intense laser dwindle , and the electron density becomes ionized with a less rate by keeping the magnetic field strength constant and increasing the intensity of the laser .",

    "<S> we scrutinize the behavior of eigenvalues of an electron of helium atom as it interacts with electric field directed along @xmath0-axis and exposed to linearly polarized intense laser field radiation . in order to achieve this , we freeze one electron of the helium atom at its ionic ground state and the motion of the second electron in the ion core is treated via a more general case of screened coulomb potential model . using the kramers - henneberger ( kh ) unitary transformation , which is semiclassical counterpart of the block - nordsieck transformation in the quantized field formalism , the squared vector potential that appears in the equation of motion is eliminated and the resultant equation is expressed in kh frame . within this frame , the resulting potential and the corresponding wave function have been expanded in fourier series and using ehlotzkys approximation , we obtain a laser - dressed potential to simulate intense laser field . by fitting the more general case of screened coulomb potential model into the laser - dressed potential , and then expanding it in taylor series up to @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the solution ( eigenvalues and wave function ) of an electron of helium atom under the influence of external electric field and high - intensity laser field , within the framework of perturbation theory formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the variation in frequency of laser radiation has no effect on the eigenvalues of an electron of helium for a particular electric field intensity directed along @xmath0-axis . </S>",
    "<S> also , for a very strong external electric field and an infinitesimal screening parameter , the system is strongly bound . </S>",
