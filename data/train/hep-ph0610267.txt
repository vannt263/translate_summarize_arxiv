    "supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite is one of the best motivated extensions of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "if susy exists at the electroweak scale , experiments at future high energy colliders should be able to discover the superpartners of known particles , and to study their properties @xcite . from the precise measurement of the masses , production cross sections and decay branching ratios of these superpartners , the fundamental parameters of the underlying susy models can be determined .",
    "this will help us to reconstruct the susy breaking mechanism .    in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite with conserved @xmath8-parity , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which in many scenarios is the lightest neutralino @xmath1 , appears at the end of the decay chain of each supersymmetric particle .",
    "the lsp escapes the detector , giving the characteristic susy signature of missing energy .",
    "while this helps to suppress backgrounds from sm processes , it also makes the measurement of supersymmetric particle masses more difficult .",
    "this is true in particular at hadron colliders like the lhc , where the total energy in a given partonic collision is not known .    at the lhc",
    ", the total susy production cross section is expected to be dominated by the production of gluinos and squarks , which decay into lighter charginos or neutralinos .",
    "of particular interest are decay chains leading to the next - to - lightest neutralino @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath4 in turn can always undergo the three - body decays @xmath9 , at least for light sm fermions @xmath10 . depending on the neutralino , sfermion and higgs boson masses",
    ", the two - body decays @xmath11 and/or @xmath12 may also be open , where @xmath13 stands for one of the three neutral higgs bosons of the mssm ; of course , higgs intermediate states will contribute negligibly if @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "these leptonic final states are of particular interest , since they can be identified relatively easily even at the lhc .",
    "moreover , the dilepton invariant mass distribution can be measured accurately .",
    "in particular , the endpoint of this distribution is used in several analyses that aim to reconstruct ( differences of ) supersymmetric particle masses @xcite . under favorable circumstances",
    "it has been shown that this endpoint can be measured to an accuracy of @xmath16 at the lhc @xcite . in order to match this accuracy ,",
    "at least one - loop corrections to @xmath4 decays have to be included .    turning to the planned @xmath17 linear collider ilc ,",
    "@xmath18 production is often the first process that is kinematically accessible @xcite ( other than @xmath19 pair production , which leads to an invisible final state ) .",
    "the detailed analysis of @xmath4 decays can then yield information about heavier supersymmetric particles . under favorable circumstances",
    ", @xmath20 @xmath21 decays may be observed at the ilc , again making the inclusion of quantum corrections mandatory to match the experimental precision . in this paper",
    "we present a complete calculation of these corrections in the mssm .",
    "the general mssm has more than one hundred unknown free parameters .",
    "therefore , it is not practicable to scan over the entire parameter space . instead , several `` benchmark scenarios '' have been suggested @xcite , which are meant to illustrate characteristic features of various scenarios of susy breaking . among those ,",
    "the so - called sps1a parameter set , which has been defined in the framework of the msugra scenario @xcite , has been studied particularly widely .",
    "it gives rise to a particle spectrum where many states are accessible both at the lhc and at a 500 gev ilc @xcite .",
    "the masses of the relevant neutralinos and sleptons at this benchmark point are listed in table  [ spstab ] .",
    "note in particular that the two - body decays @xmath22 are kinematically allowed ; here @xmath23 stands for the lighter one of the two charged sleptons of a given flavor .",
    "no other two - body decay mode is open .",
    "moreover , squarks are so heavy that non - leptonic @xmath4 decays can be neglected in this scenario .",
    "note that @xmath19 is mostly a @xmath24 gaugino ( bino ) , while @xmath25 is dominated by its neutral @xmath26 gaugino ( wino ) component ; this is typical for most scenarios where the gaugino mass unification relation holds @xcite .",
    "leptonic two - body decays of @xmath4 have been investigated at tree - level in ref .",
    "@xcite , three - body decays of @xmath0 have been also studied at tree - level in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ spstab ]    .masses of the relevant neutralinos and sleptons for parameter set sps1a @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     turning to the various partial widths of leptonic decays , we notice that the @xmath27 final state is still the largest decay mode of @xmath4 ( @xmath28 at tree level , @xmath29 at one - loop level ) since @xmath30 is smaller than the selectron and smuon masses and the large @xmath31 mixing exists only in the @xmath32 sector .",
    "note that exchange of the @xmath26 doublet sleptons now dominates for @xmath33 since the size of the @xmath34 coupling exceeds that of the @xmath35 coupling by nearly a factor of 10 and all the sleptons are off shell in this scenaro .",
    "this dominance of @xmath36 exchange also explains why the @xmath37 and @xmath38 final states now have quite similar partial widths : in the limit where @xmath4 and @xmath39 are pure @xmath26 and @xmath24 gauginos , respectively , the product of couplings involved in @xmath36 and @xmath40 exchange is exactly the same ( up to an overall sign ) .",
    "the pattern of one - loop corrections to leptonic decays is different from the original sps1a scenario .",
    "the partial width into electrons and muons is still enhanced by about 14.3% .",
    "but now the invisible partial widths are also increased , diminishing the correction of the branching rations . in the original sps1a scenario ,",
    "the one - loop partial widths of the invisible decays are almost unchanged in comparison with the tree - level ones , see table [ twobodytotal ] .",
    "note that we assumed three exactly degenerate sneutrinos here , unlike in the original sps1a scenario , where @xmath41 is slightly lighter than @xmath40 . in the modified scenario a tiny difference between the partial widths for @xmath42 and @xmath43 final states nevertheless results from one - loop corrections involving the @xmath44 mass or yukawa coupling ( e.g. from the @xmath45 and @xmath46 two - point functions ) .",
    "the hadronic final states have very large partial decay widths and branching ratios : @xmath47 kev ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 kev ( @xmath50 ) , though the squark masses are much larger than the slepton masses .",
    "part of the reason is that the @xmath51-exchange diagrams give larger contributions to hadronic final states than to leptonic ones .",
    "moreover , the interference between @xmath51 and sfermion exchanges is large and positive for the hadronic final states , while it is also large but negative for the leptonic final states .",
    "this is the main reason why the hadronic decays of @xmath4 obtain so large branching ratios .",
    "we have performed a complete one - loop calculation of the decays @xmath52 . the necessary renormalization is briefly described in sec .  2 .",
    "in most cases we used on - shell renormalization , which leaves the masses of the relevant neutralinos and sleptons ( almost ) unchanged . this is convenient for our purpose , since one important goal in the experimental study of leptonic @xmath4 decays is the determination of ( differences of ) supersymmetric particles masses from the dilepton invariant mass ( @xmath5 ) distribution .    for the cases where the intermediate charged sleptons can be on shell",
    ", these decays were calculated both completely and in a single - pole approximation at one - loop level . in the complete calculation",
    "one has to employ complex slepton masses in the relevant propagators and one - loop integrals .",
    "the single - pole approximation in this case is performed in the way that the @xmath0 decays are treated as a sequence of two two - body decays .",
    "we checked that for the well - studied sps1a parameter set , this approximation reproduces the integrated partial widths to better than 0.5% accuracy even after one - loop corrections are included . for this parameter set",
    "we find a rather small one - loop correction to the total @xmath4 decay width , but the branching ratio for the most easily detectable electron and muon final states are increased by about 13.6% at one - loop level .",
    "we also studied the effect of higher - order corrections on the @xmath53 distribution .",
    "if only one exchanged particle can be on - shell , as in the sps1a scenario , the shape of this distribution is altered only by real photon emission contributions , i.e. its peak is shifted by several gev below the endpoint .",
    "this is very important since the shape of the distribution near the endpoint should be known if the endpoint is to be determined accurately from real data . in our calculation we define collinear photons as being emitted at an angle @xmath54 relative to the emitting lepton . since the selectrons and smuons have equal masses and the light lepton mass @xmath55 is neglected except when it appears in the one - loop integrals , one will obtain identical distributions for @xmath56 and @xmath57 if the momentum of a collinear photon is added to that of the emitting lepton .",
    "the actual effect of the collinear - photon radiation depends on details of the measurement apparatus , and therefore has to be calculated anew for each experiment .",
    "we have focused on the lhc experiment in our calculation . at the lhc",
    "the electron energy is determined calorimetrically . in this case",
    "a collinear photon would hit the same cell of the calorimeter as the electron , so the two energies can not be disentangled .",
    "hence we add the momentum of a collinear photon to the one of the emitting electron in our calculation .",
    "since muons pass through the calorimeter , where the photons are detected , and measured further outside in the muon detector at the lhc ( their 3-momenta are measured through the curvature radius of their track in the magnetic field ) , the momentum of a collinear photon is not added to the one of its emitter muon in our calculation . in this case the mass effect can be seen in the dilepton invariant mass distribution .",
    "we find that the peak of the @xmath56 distribution is moved downwards by about @xmath58 gev once the one - loop corrections are added . in comparison to the @xmath56 distribution ,",
    "the peak of the @xmath59 distribution is shifted slightly to lower invariant - mass values at one - loop level .",
    "this is due to the different treatment of the collinear - photon radiation .",
    "we have also analyzed a modified sps1a scenario , with increased slepton masses , so that @xmath0 can only undergo genuine three - body decays . in this case",
    "we again find a moderate , if slightly larger , correction to the total @xmath4 width when one - loop corrections are considered , but the branching ratios for the electron and muon final states are still enhanced by about 13.6% at the one - loop level .",
    "we have seen in fig .",
    "[ universal ] that for the simpler case @xmath60 the bulk of the non - qed correction to the partial width can be absorbed into new @xmath61 couplings , which are sensitive to the spectrum of sfermions . in the case of @xmath44 final states ,",
    "significant @xmath62 mixing as well as the @xmath44 yukawa coupling have to be included in the analysis .",
    "we have not attempted to define such effective couplings and , perhaps , mixing angles here .",
    "in this modified sps1a scenario , the dilepton invariant mass distributions have a rather complicated shape , showing the contributions from @xmath51 exchange near the upper endpoints of the distributions . in this case",
    "the shape of these distributions is affected not only by real photon emission , which again leads to significant negative corrections for large @xmath53 , but also by virtual corrections , which can e.g. differ for @xmath51 and slepton exchange diagrams . in this case",
    "the shape of the distribution away from the endpoint also carries information about slepton masses and neutralino mixing angles . fitting tree - level distributions to real data",
    "might therefore give wrong results for these physical parameters .",
    "in this context a careful analysis of collinear radiation is also important , since differences in the energy measurements of electrons and muons could lead to spurious differences of fitted selectron and smuon masses . here",
    "the collinear - photon radiations for electrons and muons are treated as discussed beforehand .",
    "one finds that the one - loop shapes of the @xmath56 and @xmath59 distributions are different , though the selectrons and smuons have equal masses in our calculations .",
    "we conclude that higher - order corrections to leptonic @xmath4 decays can exceed the 10% level both in integrated partial widths and branching ratios , and in the shape of the dilepton invariant mass distribution .",
    "attempts to absorb much of the large virtual corrections into effective running couplings might be rewarding .",
    "an accurate understanding of @xmath25 decays is of considerable importance , since this is one of the lightest visible particles that can be produced directly at future @xmath17 colliders , and plays a prominent role in the analysis of cascade decays of gluinos and squarks at the lhc .",
    "we would like to thank t. fritzsche , t. hahn , and h. rzehak for helpful discussions , as well as a. bredenstein and m. roth for help with calculating the hard photon bremsstrahlung contribution .",
    "md thanks the school of physics at kias , seoul , as well as the theory group at the university of hawaii for hospitality .",
    "for the numerical evaluation , the following values of the sm parameters are used : @xmath63 the on - shell renormalization scheme requires @xmath64 for one - loop calculations . for the tree level expressions we instead use the effective coupling for the overall normalization , @xmath65 we saw in sec .  5 that this choice leads to good perturbative stability of the total @xmath4 decay width .",
