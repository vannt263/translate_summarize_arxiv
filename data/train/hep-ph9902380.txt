    "the topic of structure formation in the early universe is still an open problem which has challenged many cosmologists in the past years . in the last decade",
    "great attention was devoted to the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) model , characterized by a flat universe with cold particles as dark matter , and by density fluctuations evolving from a primordial scale invariant ( harrison - zeldovich ) spectrum .",
    "this model turned out quite successful and its predictions about the properties of the different kinds of galaxies that form agreed well with observations @xcite .",
    "however , more recent results @xcite showed that , once normalized at large scale by cobe data , the standard cdm model predicts more power than observed at small scale .",
    "several ideas have been proposed to improve the situation .",
    "a possibility is to change the inflationary prediction on the primordial spectrum .",
    "a non flat spectrum can be achieved for example in supergravity inflationary models @xcite , in models with more than one inflaton @xcite , or also by considering a non adiabatic evolution of the inflaton field @xcite .",
    "another possibility is offered by mixed hot plus cold dark matter @xcite and by `` warm '' dark matter models @xcite , since light particles have high speed at the decoupling era and can not cluster on small scales .",
    "another way to fit the observations is the introduction of a non - zero cosmological constant @xmath0 @xcite . at present",
    "this is the most appealing solution , since an incoming agreement about a cosmological constant is being provided by supernovae measurements @xcite . by examining high - redshift sne ia and using them as candles to determine the distances to faraway galaxies",
    ", it is indeed possible to find evidence for an accelerating universe and thus exclude models with @xmath1 .    while statistics of these experiments is becoming more and more solid with the increasing of the number of observed high-@xmath2 supernovae ( 42 for @xcite and 16 for @xcite ) , still  as the authors of @xcite say themselves",
    " some doubts can be cast on their systematics .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark here that the introduction of a cosmological constant opens many other unsolved puzzles .",
    "first of all , if one associates the cosmological constant to the energy of the vacuum , one would expect either @xmath1 ( if some symmetry prevents it ) or @xmath3 , while @xmath4 appears as an incredibly fine - tuned small value .",
    "second , it is not clear why @xmath5 should be of the same order of @xmath6 . in order to solve these problems , quintessential models",
    " where @xmath5 is a dynamical parameter associated to the energy of a slow evolving scalar field  are becoming popular , but they are far from being conclusive @xcite .",
    "another point in favor of the option of a non - vanishing vacuum energy contribution comes from measurements of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the latter quantity can be observationally determined from the position of the first acoustic peak of the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) .",
    "preliminary results ( which are still plagued by large errors ) indicate a preference for @xmath9 ( see @xcite and references therein ) . clearly , also theoretical arguments based on inflation strongly favor a flat universe . as for @xmath7 ,",
    "its best determination comes from measurements of the baryon fraction in clusters . using clusters as `` fair samples '' of matter in the universe , the bound on @xmath10 from the standard nucleosynthesis , and determinations of the amount of baryons and the total matter in clusters",
    ", it has been inferred that @xmath7 should not exceed 40% @xcite .  other circumstantial evidences for @xmath11 related to the evolution of the abundance of rich cluster with redshift",
    "are more controversial . as convincing as this",
    "arguments look for @xmath11 , we think that they should not be considered conclusive on the intriguing issue of the matter present in the universe .    in view of the present uncertainties ,",
    "we think it is still valuable to consider other options tackling the failure of the standard cdm model .",
    "in this paper we focus on the possibility that , in addition to the cdm , there exist decaying ( or sometimes called volatile ) particles . the decay products of these particles can be used to increase the horizon length at the equivalence time , hence increasing the power at large scales @xcite .    in the past years",
    ", only a couple of schemes which implement this idea have been proposed ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the candidate models must have among the decay products only very weakly interacting particles , since stringent cosmological and astrophysical bounds apply when more interacting particles are produced .",
    "the most popular scenario for the realization of the shift of @xmath12 involves an @xmath13mev @xmath14 neutrino decaying in majoron plus a lighter neutrino .",
    "an alternative possibility is given by decays with the presence of the axion field and its superpartners .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to update and extend the above analyses in light of some other candidate models and of the most recent observational data .",
    "the main new possibility that we suggest involves decays with production of high energy neutrinos .",
    "these processes must be handled with care since they can enter in conflict with bounds imposed by the non observations of the neutrinos ( mainly for very late decays ) or ( for early enough decays ) by big - bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "these last bounds apply because the produced neutrinos can scatter off background antineutrinos , generating an electromagnetic cascade which can photodissociate the light elements previously produced .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii@xmath14 we present the general idea of the shift of the equivalence scale . in sec .",
    "iii@xmath14 we report the main cosmological and astrophysical bounds which apply in case of production of high energy neutrinos . in sec .",
    "iv@xmath14 we discuss the possibility to implement this idea in a supersymmetry context .",
    "in secv@xmath14 we switch to the option involving @xmath15 mev @xmath14 unstable neutrinos and we study two other decaying processes ( namely the decay into three neutrinos and into neutrino plus familon ) in addition to the more common decay into neutrino plus majoron .",
    "the results and some prospects for the future are presented in the conclusions .",
    "as we said in the introduction , the standard cdm model fails to describe the observed spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "however , an agreement with observations can still be reached in an @xmath16 context if the horizon length at the equivalence scale is increased .",
    "the reason is that during the radiation dominated era super horizon fluctuations can grow , while sub horizon ones can not .",
    "thus , if we delay the matter domination ( or , in other words , we increase the horizon length @xmath17 ) we give the large modes more time for growing , while the small ( sub horizon ) ones are kept frozen by a sort of `` pressure of radiation '' .    in standard models ( with relativistic particle at present provided by cbr photons and three species of relic neutrinos ) the length of the horizon at the equivalence time",
    "is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the ratio density of the universe over critical density ( @xmath20 for a flat universe ) and @xmath21 is the hubble parameter in units of @xmath22 .",
    "inflationary models strongly prefer @xmath23 , while observations constrain @xmath24\\:$ ] .",
    "more recent data suggest to tighten this interval for @xmath21 ( @xmath25 @xcite ) .",
    "however , since a stable agreement on the value of the hubble constant has not been reached so far , in our analysis we prefer to stick to the more conservative range @xmath26\\,$ ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed spectrum of fluctuations is well fitted by cdm models only for @xmath27 i.e. , for @xmath28 .    instead of lowering @xmath29 , a raising of @xmath30",
    "can be achieved by considering an unstable matter which decays into relativistic particles @xcite .",
    "photons can not accomplish this task : indeed @xmath31 produced after @xmath32 must be of negligible amount or they would distort the shape of the cbr ( see next section ) , while photons emitted at early times thermalize and just contribute to rising the temperature of the ( thermal ) background to the value we measure today [ and from which we get eq .",
    "( [ leq ] ) ] .",
    "if the decay products are not photons ( let us call them `` invisible '' ) , the result is that the relativistic energy is greater than the one that we infer just measuring the temperature of the cbr .",
    "thus , for appropriate choice of the decay time @xmath33 , @xmath34 can increase .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( inspired by the work of h.b .",
    "kim and j.e .",
    "kim @xcite ) we give a schematic representation of the model that we have described .",
    "we denote by @xmath35 the matter which decays , by @xmath36 its ( comoving ) energy density ,  following the standard notation , @xmath37 is the mass of the particle , while @xmath38 is the ratio between its number density and the entropy density of the universe . and by @xmath39 the part of it which goes into relativistic particles .",
    "for example , in sec .",
    "iii@xmath14 we will discuss the decay gravitino @xmath40 sneutrino @xmath41 neutrino .",
    "the sneutrinos produced by this process have a mass which is typically of the same order of the one of the gravitinos , and thus they quickly derelativizes .",
    "hence , the only energy which contributes to the shift of @xmath30 and which we denote by the suffix @xmath42 is the one associated to the neutrinos .",
    "thus , in this case @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath35 particle is not relativistic before decaying , thus its energy density increases with respect to the thermal one . in order to realize the shift of @xmath17 , we see from fig .  [ fig1 ] that @xmath35 must decay only after it dominates .",
    "thus the main peculiarities of this scheme are ( i ) that @xmath44 , and ( ii ) that a new matter domination era  starting at @xmath45  arises .",

    "those stated here are somehow model independent and represent general constraints that have always to be taken into account . in the next section",
    "we will instead discuss limits which apply in case of production of high energy neutrinos .",
    "the first bound comes from nucleosynthesis and requires that at the time of neutrino decoupling the energy density of @xmath35 is less than that of one neutrino species @xcite : @xmath49 the demand that the fraction of the energy density into relativistic decay products is high enough to realize the shift yields : @xmath50 notice that imposing eqs .",
    "( [ kimeq ] ) , ( [ upplim ] ) , and ( [ lowlim ] ) , we safely avoid overclosure of the universe by the decay products .",
    "as already remarked , the bounds considered in the previous section are certainly necessary , but they can be not sufficient if the decay products affect our present observations in some other ways than the only shift of the equivalence scale .",
    "the bounds  ( [ upplim ] ) and  ( [ lowlim ] ) are sufficient for processes like axino @xmath40 axion @xmath41 gravitino @xcite , or for decays with production of low energy neutrinos , since all these particles have very weak interactions .",
    "for example , severe limits exclude the possibility of realizing the shift of @xmath51 if the decay produces a non negligible amount of photons .",
    "the authors are grateful to s.  bonometto for remarking this point . indeed , eq .  ( [ kimeq ] )",
    "is satisfied only if the relativistic energy density is about @xmath52 times @xcite larger than the thermal one ( that is the one that we infer by measuring the temperature of the microwave background radiation ) . as a consequence ,",
    "if the decay occurs at early time , the produced photons thermalize and thus must not carry more than @xmath53 of the total energy density of the decaying particles . on the other hand , if the decay happens later the photons produced must be much less than the thermal ones , or they would appear as a clear distortion in the observed black - body spectrum .",
    "in both cases , it follows that the amount of energy density in form of photons must be much less than the one undergone into other relative particles .    from the above discussion",
    "we realize that the shift of @xmath51 can not be implemented in decays with the production of photons .",
    "we thus switch to the case of high energy neutrinos among the decay products , which needs a more detailed discussion .",
    "in fact , in this case one has to discuss some limits which come from the non observation of the neutrinos and from bbn .    *",
    "non observation : the limits coming from the imb nucleon decay detector are low enough @xcite  see also @xcite , where the specific case of a decaying fermion with abundance determined by annihilation via standard model gauge bosons is considered . to rule out a flux of neutrinos necessary to shift @xmath12 if they have at present an energy @xmath54mev .",
    "+ the energy interval @xmath55 has been in the past or it is currently monitored by several experiments @xcite and no claim has been made about an anomalous diffuse neutrino flux .",
    "+ we thus impose the safe requirement @xmath56 , i.e. that neutrinos coming from the decay of the x matter do have a present energy lower than @xmath57 .",
    "+ making the approximation @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the energy of the neutrinos at their production , we get @xmath60 we see that , for a given value of energy density of the produced neutrinos @xmath61 , decays with lower values of the energy of each neutrino ( and higher numerical density ) are less constrained . *",
    "bbn : neutrinos produced at early times can annihilate off background antineutrinos and produce @xmath62 pairs ; then the charged particles can photodissociate  via electromagnetic cascade  the light elements produced during bbn @xcite .",
    "+ in the limit of fermi approximation  valid for @xmath63 , i.e. , @xmath64 that is for all cases of our interest .",
    "the fraction of neutrinos `` converted '' into radiation is @xcite @xmath65 thus , once the neutrinos from the decay have enough energy to generate @xmath62 pairs ,  i.e. , for @xmath66 we must calculate the density of radiation produced @xmath67 and analyze if it can spoil the good agreement between the observational data and the standard big - bang nucleosynthesis ( that is in absence of decaying particles ) . in this way",
    "we can get an upper limit on @xmath68 as a function of the decay lifetime @xmath69 .",
    "+ we do not review here the whole analysis about the impact of an electromagnetic cascade on the abundance of the light elements , but we just state the results of the numerical work @xcite , addressing the interested reader to the references listed there .",
    "see also @xcite , where a detailed analysis including electromagnetic cascade has been performed for lifetime bigger then @xmath70 sec .",
    "the two primordial abundances that most constrain the theoretical predictions are the @xmath71he and the deuterium ones . at present , different observations give the amount of these abundances with some discrepancies : @xmath72 we discuss the implications considering the different above ranges . + in the case of low d and low @xmath71he , the predictions of the standard bbn ( i.e.  without decaying particles ) are excluded at @xmath73 confidence level .",
    "a non - vanishing @xmath74 is preferred in order to destroy a sufficient amount of the primordial deuterium .",
    "thus , if this case will turn out to be the right one , it could be worth to examine if the scheme that we are proposing here can be advocated both to realize the shift of @xmath30 and to explain the would be `` standard bbn failure '' .",
    "+ the other three cases give qualitatively similar results .",
    "for all of them standard bbn is allowed and we have upper bounds on @xmath74 for each value of @xmath69 .",
    "+ the results are summarized in fig .",
    "first we report ( from @xcite ) the bounds imposed by bbn on @xmath75 .",
    "we show only the case of low d and low @xmath71he and the case of low d and high @xmath71he ( the other two being similar to the last one ) .",
    "the gray area denotes the points in the plane @xmath76 excluded at @xmath77 c.l .",
    "the region within the dotted lines corresponds to points allowed at @xmath73 c.l .",
    "( in the lower panel these regions extends over the entire blank space ) .",
    "+ then we analyze the impact on these regions of the implementation of the shift of @xmath30 with a decay in high energy neutrinos with the subsequent production photons .",
    "the straight lines refer to a decay in which the initial energy density is equally shared between neutrinos and a massive decay particle which quickly derelativises ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the horizontal lines correspond to the upper and lower bounds @xmath79 [ eq .  ( [ upplim ] ) ] and @xmath80 [ eq .  ( [ lowlim ] ) ] , while the two diagonal ones indicate for each @xmath81 the amount of @xmath82 produced when the shift of @xmath30 is realized [ eq .  ( [ kimeq ] ) ] .",
    "+ the results shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] put a severe constraint on @xmath83 , since they show that the amount of neutrinos `` converted '' in photons must be a very small fraction of the total one in order to respect the limits imposed by bbn .",
    "for example , we see that at @xmath84 the quantity @xmath85 must be smaller than about @xmath86 ( according to different values of @xmath87 ) .",
    "the same limit must be imposed also on the branching ratio of the decay channels in which photons are produced . in the next section",
    "we study if it is possible to implement the shift of @xmath51 in supersymmetric models with and without @xmath88 parity .",
    "the main part is devoted to the study of two processes with the production of high energy neutrinos .",
    "we show there that the only one of the two model which is workable satisfies also the bounds discussed in this section .",
    "in supersymmetric models , the terms @xmath89 are usually dropped away from the superpotential in order to avoid fast proton decay . to do this ,",
    "a discrete symmetry which is called @xmath88 parity and which is violated by the above terms is imposed .",
    "@xmath88 parity forbids terms in which supersymmetric particles are in odd number . as a consequence",
    ", superparticles can be produced or destroyed only in pairs , and the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) is stable .",
    "an advantage of supersymmetry is that this particle , for adequate but natural choices of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) parameters , is a good cold dark matter candidate  @xcite .",
    "however , proton decay requires the violation of both baryon and lepton number .",
    "thus it is not in disagreement with the present limits on proton lifetime to make vanishing the last term in eq .",
    "( [ rvio ] ) while keeping different from zero some ( or all ) of the first three , or viceversa to take only the last term non - vanishing .",
    "another phenomenologically acceptable possibility is to break @xmath88 parity spontaneously . in these scenarios",
    "one typically introduces some isosinglets which acquire a @xmath90 and break @xmath88 and lepton symmetries , without entering in conflict with the bounds imposed by the @xmath91 width .",
    "whatever possibility one may choose , as a result in both cases the lsp is non longer stable and , unless we take very a very small breaking of @xmath88 @xcite , it can not be invoked as cdm .",
    "nevertheless , it may be possible for its decay to implement the shift of @xmath34 .    in the next two subsections we discuss the possibility of realizing the shift of @xmath51 in a supersymmetric context ,",
    "first in schemes with conserved @xmath88 parity and then in others where this symmetry is broken .      in the context of supersymmetry with conserved @xmath88 parity",
    "one would like to implement the shift of the equivalence scale through the decay of the next lsp to the lsp .",
    "the main difficulty is that `` ordinary '' superparticles decay extremely fastly .",
    "for example , the lifetime of the decay @xmath92 is @xmath93 and a strong fine tuning is required in order to have a late decay .",
    "it is thus mandatory to consider processes with very low interacting particles .",
    "one of these particles is the gravitino ( that is the spin @xmath94 superpartner of the graviton ) since its interactions are suppressed by inverse powers of the planck mass .",
    "this option is already present in @xcite , where the decay axino @xmath40 axion @xmath41 gravitino is considered .",
    "this scheme implements the shift of @xmath34 for several values of the axino decoupling temperature with respect to the reheating temperature , and its good `` flexibility '' is essentially due to the very little danger that both the produced particles have on our observations .",
    "another interesting scheme involving an unstable gravitino is present in @xcite , where the scenario characterized by the process  we do not consider here other decay modes of the gravitino into `` ordinary '' superparticles , since they typically produce photons .",
    "gravitino @xmath40 neutrino @xmath41 sneutrino is discussed in details , but without considering the problem of the shift of the equivalence scale .",
    "the scheme proposed in @xcite is a very interesting one , since it has the following advantages :    * in standard models either @xmath95 kev @xmath96 ( if stable ) or @xmath97 tev @xmath96 ( if it decays , this bound is imposed by bbn ) . here",
    "the primordial gravitinos are diluted away by inflation , and the ones considered are generated by the reheating .",
    "for appropriate values of the reheating temperature , intermediate masses are allowed @xcite . *",
    "usually the sneutrino is not assumed as the lsp , since its relic abundance is very small . in this case",
    "we have instead @xmath98 .",
    "* there is absence of direct @xmath31 production .",
    "the following relations hold @xcite :    * abundance from the reheating : @xmath99 * decay lifetime : @xmath100 * fraction of energy transferred to the neutrino : @xmath101 * closure by @xmath102 : @xmath103    in these equations , @xmath104 is the reheating temperature and @xmath105 is the contribution to the critical density of the sneutrinos from the decay . we ask for @xmath106 .    the conservative experimental bound @xmath107 @xcite limits [ from eq .  ( [ gra4 ] ) ] @xmath104 and thus the abundance @xmath108 .",
    "it follows that , when we try to implement eq .",
    "( [ kimeq ] ) , we must delay @xmath81 by a fine tuning @xmath109 . however , in this case the fraction @xmath110 of energy to the neutrinos become very low and the bound @xmath111 is never satisfied ( in other words , we have neutrino domination only if we delay the decay after the allowed time )",
    ".    we can ask how we can improve the situation .",
    "one possible way is to require that the sneutrino is not the lsp and thus the ones produced by gravitino decay go in turn into neutrino plus neutralino ( now the lsp ) . in this case",
    "we can expect an improvement since , even with fine tuning , the second neutrino has about half the energy of the initial gravitino .    in order for this scheme to work ,",
    "the direct decay gravitino @xmath40 neutralino @xmath41 its ordinary partner must be forbidden by kinematics , or it would be the dominant channel ( with consequent production of photons ) .",
    "the best that we can do is to choose @xmath112 pure higgsino and forbid the direct decay by suitably rising the mass of the corresponding higgs particle .",
    "this mass must also be kept high in order to avoid the decay @xmath113 via virtual higgs .",
    "however , it turns out that this scheme requires @xmath114 and thus raising the higgs mass at this scale appears rather unnatural .",
    "a possible solution is to consider the inverse process with the sneutrino as nlsp which decays into the gravitino plus neutrino .",
    "the first problem is the possible overclosure of the universe by the relic gravitinos .",
    "also in this case we can overtake it by requiring that inflation dilutes away the gravitinos from the big - bang and by appropriately bounding the reheating temperature @xcite .",
    "the second difficulty of this scenario comes from the low relic sneutrino abundance , due to the high @xmath115 annihilation cross section .",
    "however , this relic density increases in presence of an asymmetry between the sneutrinos and the antisneutrinos ( this is possible since sneutrinos and antisneutrinos can be distinguished by their opposite lepton number ) . indeed in this case",
    "almost only the sneutrinos ( or the antisneutrinos ) in excess survive the annihilation .  the other annihilation channel @xmath116 through zino exchange",
    "must also be suppressed by suitably rising the mass of the mediator . in this way one can consider the sneutrino relic abundance @xmath117 as a free parameter dependent on the choice of the initial asymmetry .",
    "the lifetime of this decay is given by @xcite @xmath118 consequently , the shift of @xmath51 is achieved for  when we use this notation , the underlined value is referred to the @xmath119 case , while the other one to @xmath120 .",
    "@xmath121 however , this value is too high , since the gravitinos produced by the decay would contribute to the critical density by @xmath122 in eq .",
    "( [ gravclos ] ) the dependence of @xmath123 on the gravitino mass cancels out and one is left with the only free parameter @xmath124 . since @xmath125 @xcite from accelerator experiments , the scheme here described can not work because the produced gravitinos would overclose the universe .",
    "this discussion shows that the realization of the shift of @xmath126 in an @xmath88 conserving supersymmetric scenario is problematic , although one has _ a priori _ the possibility to consider particles very low interacting and thus with long enough lifetimes . in particular",
    ", finding alternative schemes to the one involving gravitinos and axinos together ( as discussed in @xcite ) appears a very difficult task .      in models with",
    "broken @xmath88 parity one may try to implement the shift of @xmath51 through the decay of the lsp .",
    "indeed , one can consider very long lifetimes for this particle simply lowering enough the breaking of the @xmath88 symmetry .    if the breaking is made via one ( or more ) of the soft terms listed in eq .",
    "( [ rvio ] ) , the decay typically leads to a nonnegligible production of photons or charged particles . as an example",
    ", if neutralino is the lsp and if one breaks @xmath88 through the term @xmath127 , the process @xmath128 ( through sneutrino or selectron exchange ) constitutes the main decay channel .  if @xmath88 is broken by another of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ rvio ] ) , also quarks are produced in the decay .",
    "the same problem also arises in gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) models @xcite , where the lsp is typically an @xmath13kev gravitino . in presence of soft",
    "breaking of @xmath88 parity the gravitino is very long living and it typically decays via loop into photons and neutrinos . we thus conclude that these schemes offer very little chances to implement the shift of @xmath129 , since  as we said above  decays with the production of photons must be excluded .",
    "a completely different and more workable scenario is offered by the possibility of breaking @xmath88 parity spontaneously . in the model",
    "described in @xcite this is achieved by the extension of the mssm with three isosinglet scalars  the presence of all these new fields is necessary if one wants to break the lepton symmetry at tree level .",

    "the coupling familon - neutrinos can be written @xmath192 if the natural assumption of universality between the couplings of the familon to neutrinos and to charged leptons is made , the scale of symmetry breaking must be taken @xmath193 in order to avoid problems with stellar energy loss due to familon bremsstrahlung of the electrons in the stellar medium @xcite .",

    "( [ limtau ] ) we have @xmath196 the upper limits are below the allowed value for @xmath190 stated above .",
    "the stellar energy loss bound can be considerably weakened if we consider a goldstone boson which directly couples only to neutrinos .",
    "this is the case for the majoron @xcite which arises in models with the spontaneous breaking of the lepton symmetry ( @xmath136 ) .    the gelmini - roncadelli model @xcite makes use of only left - handed neutrinos and has lepton number spontaneously broken by the vev of an su(2)@xmath197 higgs triplet .",
    "nowadays this option is ruled out by the invisible width of @xmath198 .",
    "we consider , instead , majoron models _  la _ chikashige - mohapatra - peccei @xcite , with right - handed neutrinos and @xmath136 broken by the vev of an isosinglet scalar @xmath199 .",
    "this scalar carries @xmath200 and is coupled to two right - handed neutrinos through a yukawa interactions . when @xmath188 acquires a vev , @xmath201 , l breaks and a majorana mass term is recovered .",
    "in addition to this term , a dirac mass term couples left - handed and right - handed neutrinos via the usual yukawa interaction with the standard model higgs doublet .",
    "if @xmath190 is taken much bigger than the electroweak scale @xmath202 , the diagonalization of the neutrino mass matrix splits the eigenvectors into heavy ( mainly @xmath203 , with mass of the order of v ) and light ( mainly @xmath204 , with mass of the order @xmath205 ) neutrinos ( see - saw mechanism @xcite ) .",
    "however , this minimal model gives for the decay @xmath206 a lifetime bigger than the age of the universe , since the leading order term vanishes for flavor changing processes @xcite .",
    "this problem can be circumvented in non minimal models ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for natural values of the couplings ,",
    "these models give lifetimes of the order @xcite @xmath207 from eqs .",
    "( [ neuk ] ) and ( [ majo ] ) we get @xmath208 the main bounds on the scale @xmath190 come in this case from majoron emission in supernovae explosions , and in particular from the neutrino pulse observation from sn1987a .",
    "although this bounds depend on the model used and the discussion about them is not yet completely set @xcite , from @xcite we see that values @xmath209 tev can be reasonably allowed . from eq .",
    "( [ majres ] ) we see that scales @xmath190 about @xmath210 gev ( values well above the sn limits ) are suitable to obtain the shift of the equivalence scale .",
    "in this paper we have considered several models with @xmath211 plus the presence of a late decaying particle in order to match the observed spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "while having such late decaying particles is not unnatural in the most popular extensions of the standard model , our analysis shows that in most cases these models are severely constrained by cosmological and astrophysical considerations .",
    "the main reason is that in the scheme we are considering the decaying particle must dominate over the cold dark matter and the relic radiative background before it decays .",
    "thus the decay products have high abundance and easily enter in conflict with bounds imposed , for example , by their non observation or by nucleosynthesis .",
    "the stiffness of the problem becomes clear when one considers decays with the production of photons ( or charged particles ) . in this case",
    "severe bounds force the photon energy density to be much less than the one needed to shift the equivalence scale . as a consequence ,",
    "all the decays that give rise to the shift must have a negligible production of photons .    less constrained but still delicate",
    "is the case when high energy neutrinos are produced .",
    "in addition to the bounds imposed by their non observation , we can not neglect the possibility that they scatter off background thermal neutrinos , with consequent production of photons .",
    "we have seen that these bounds are strictly related to the energy of each neutrino .",
    "thus  for equal amount of energy density of the produced neutrinos  bigger abundances and lower energies of the single particles are preferred .    among the models studied , we focused in particular on supersymmetric extensions of the standard model .",
    "we have split the discussion in models with conserved and with broken @xmath88 parity .    in the case of conserved @xmath88 parity",
    "the main problems come from the necessity of delaying the decay time",
    ". rather than fine tuning the masses ( we saw that , in typical cases , masses must differ less than one part over @xmath212 ) we have studied models with very weakly coupled particles , like gravitinos or axinos . however , we saw that even in this case many difficulties arise .    if we instead choose to break @xmath88 parity , the natural candidate for the decaying particle is the lsp .",
    "models where @xmath88 is explicitly broken via soft term can hardly accomplish the shift of the equivalence scale , since avoiding with the latter the production of photons or charged particles is very difficult .",
    "the situation improves in schemes where @xmath88 parity is spontaneously broken by the @xmath90 of an isosinglet , where decays like neutralino into neutrino and majoron can easily implement the shift of the equivalence scale .",
    "although we have presented particular processes in some detail , we have tried to maintain the discussion on the most possible general ground , underlying the main difficulties that each different class of models faces and ( when possible ) some ways to overcome them .",
    "given that evidences for @xmath11 need more solid confirmation , the option @xmath213 with a delayed equivalence scale remains still interesting . in case future observational work would favor this latter options , we hope that this work will be a basis for further more detailed investigations .",
    "in particular , we think that important indications will come out from the observation of the acoustic peaks of the cbr @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the peaks produced by the decays that we analyzed here could constitute an important complement to the present work .",
