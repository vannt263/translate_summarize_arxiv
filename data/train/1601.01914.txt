    "generally , one of the purpose of inverse scattering problem is to identify locations of small electromagnetic inhomogeneities from measured scattered field or far - field pattern .",
    "this problem is known as a difficult problem due to the its nonlinearity and ill - posedness but still interesting and challengeable problem because this arises in mathematics , physics , medical imaging , engineering sciences , etc , highly related to the modern life .",
    "related works can be found in @xcite and references therein .    motivated this ,",
    "various algorithms for solving inverse scattering problem have been developed .",
    "following various researches @xcite , most of which are based on the least - square method so , for guarantee a successful performance , _ a priori _ information of unknown inhomogeneities , appropriate regularization terms highly depends on the specific problems , calculation of complex frchet ( or domain ) derivative must be considered beforehand .",
    "if any one of these conditions is not fulfilled , serious problems such as non - convergence , the local minimizer problem , and a considerable increase in the computational costs due to the large number of iteration procedures will arise .",
    "for an alternative , fast identification algorithms have been developed . among them , single- and multi - frequency kirchhoff and subspace migration have shown their feasibilities in detection of small inhomogeneities for full- and limited - view inverse scattering problems , refer to @xcite .",
    "however , exact value of the applied frequency must be known in order to detect locations of inhomogeneities accurately . if not",
    ", it would only be possible to recognize the existence of inhomogeneities , i.e , .",
    "identification of exact locations of inhomogeneities is impossible . throughout various simulation results ,",
    "this fact has been examined ( see @xcite ) and recently , related mathematical theory of multiple signal classification ( music ) algorithm for detecting small electromagnetic inhomogeneities has been concerned ( see @xcite ) ; however , reliable mathematical theory has not yet been developed satisfactorily .    in this paper",
    ", we carefully analyze subspace migration imaging function with inaccurate frequency by establishing a relationship with bessel functions of order zero and one of the first kind .",
    "this is based on the asymptotic expansion formula in the presence of a set of electromagnetic inhomogeneities with small diameter and the structure of singular vectors associate with the nonzero singular values of the so - called multi - static response ( msr ) matrix collected from the far - field pattern .",
    "the identified relationship explains why the subspace migration yields inaccurate locations of small inhomogeneities with inaccurate frequency .",
    "remaining parts of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    ", we introduce the direct scattering problem , far - field pattern , and asymptotic expansion formula . in section [ sec:3 ] , the subspace migration algorithm for detection of small inhomogeneities",
    "is surveyed . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    ", we establish a relationship between subspace migration imaging function and bessel functions , and investigate the cause of inaccurate results . in section [ sec:5 ] , the results of the numerical simulations are exhibited in support of our analysis .",
    "a short conclusion follows in section [ sec:6 ] .",
    "let @xmath0 be a homogeneous inclusion with a small diameter @xmath1 in the two - dimensional space @xmath2 . throughout this paper , we assume totally @xmath3 different small inhomogeneities @xmath0 exist in @xmath2 such that @xmath4 where @xmath5 denote the location of @xmath0 and @xmath6 is a simply connected smooth domain containing the origin . for the sake , we assume that @xmath7 is a unit circle and @xmath0 are separated from each other .",
    "let @xmath8 be a given positive angular frequency with @xmath9 denotes given wavelength",
    ". throughout this paper @xmath10 is sufficiently large enough and satisfying following condition @xmath11 for all @xmath12 with @xmath13 .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we denote @xmath14 and @xmath15 be the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability of @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "similarly , we let @xmath16 and @xmath17 be those of @xmath0 . for simplicity ,",
    "let @xmath18 be the collection of @xmath0 , @xmath19 and we define the following piecewise constants : @xmath20 in this paper , we assume that @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 for the sake of simplicity .    at a given positive angular frequency @xmath10 ,",
    "let @xmath24 be the time - harmonic total field that satisfies the helmholtz equation @xmath25 with transmission conditions on @xmath0 for all @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 be the solution of ( [ helmholtzequation ] ) without @xmath18 . in this paper , we consider the following plane - wave illumination : for a vector @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "here , @xmath30 denotes a two - dimensional unit circle and throughout this paper , we assume that the set @xmath31 spans @xmath30 .",
    "generally , the total field @xmath24 can be divided into the incident field @xmath27 and the unknown scattered field @xmath32 , which satisfies the sommerfeld radiation condition @xmath33 uniformly in all directions @xmath34 .",
    "notice that we assumed @xmath21 so , we set @xmath35 from now on .",
    "as given in @xcite , @xmath36 can be written as the following asymptotic expansion formula in terms of @xmath1 @xmath37 where @xmath38 is uniform in @xmath39 and @xmath28 , @xmath40 is a @xmath41 symmetric matrix defined as @xmath42\\mbox{area}(\\mathbf{b}_m),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath43 is the two - dimensional time harmonic green function ( or fundamental solution to helmholtz equation ) @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is the hankel function of order zero and of the first kind .",
    "the far - field pattern is defined as function @xmath46 that satisfies @xmath47 as @xmath48 uniformly on @xmath34 .",
    "subspace migration algorithm for identifying locations of small defects introduced in @xcite used the structure of a singular vector of the multi - static response ( msr ) matrix @xmath49_{j , l=1}^{n}=[u_\\infty({\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}}_j,{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_l)]_{j , l=1}^{n}$ ] . note that by combining ( [ scatteredfield ] ) , ( [ farfield ] ) , and the asymptotic behavior of the hankel function , @xmath50 the far - field pattern @xmath51 with observation number @xmath52 and incident wave number @xmath53 can be represented as @xmath54    now ,",

    "this decomposition leads us to introduce subspace migration for detecting locations of @xmath0 as follows .",
    "first , let us perform the singular value decomposition ( svd ) as follows : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the left and right singular vectors of @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "then , by comparing ( [ decomposition ] ) and ( [ svd ] ) , we introduce the following test vector @xmath65^te^{i\\omega{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_1\\cdot{\\mathbf{x}}},{\\mathbf{c}}_3\\cdot[1,{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_2]^te^{i\\omega{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_2\\cdot{\\mathbf{x}}}\\cdots,{\\mathbf{c}}_n\\cdot[1,{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_n]^te^{i\\omega{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_n\\cdot{\\mathbf{x}}}\\bigg]^t.\\ ] ] notice that since @xmath66 and @xmath67 are unit vectors , we introduce following unit vector @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "then , based on the orthonormal property of singular vectors , we can easily observe that for a proper choice of @xmath70 , @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "correspondingly , we can introduce following imaging function : @xmath73 the value of @xmath74 will be close to @xmath75 at @xmath76 and close to @xmath77 at @xmath78 . this is the subspace migration algorithm for identifying locations of small inhomogeneities .",
    "based on the observation discussed in section [ sec:3 ] , accurate value of @xmath10 must be applied to ( [ vecw ] ) for identifying locations of @xmath0 accurately . if not , it has been heuristically confirmed that inaccurate locations of @xmath0 are detected via subspace migration . from now on ,",
    "we analyze structure of ( [ imagingfunction ] ) and explain why this phenomenon occurs . before starting , we assume that @xmath10 is unknown so , a fixed positive value @xmath79 applied to ( [ vecw ] ) instead of @xmath10 . since , we have no _ a priori _ information of targets , we can not select optimal vectors @xmath70 in ( [ vecw ] ) .",

    "[ bessel ] let @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "then for sufficiently large @xmath86 , the following relations hold : @xmath87 where @xmath88 denotes the bessel function of integer order @xmath89 of the first kind .",
    "now , we state the main result of this paper .",
    "[ theoremfrequency ] assume that total number of incident and observation directions @xmath86 is sufficiently large enough .",
    "then , @xmath90 can be represented as follows : @xmath91    since @xmath86 is sufficiently large and @xmath55 for all @xmath52 , by comparing ( [ ed ] ) and ( [ svd ] ) , we can observe that @xmath92    first , applying lemma [ bessel ] yields @xmath93 thus @xmath94 next , applying lemma [ bessel ] again , we can evaluate @xmath95 hence , @xmath96 similarly , we can get @xmath97    by combining ( [ term1 ] ) , ( [ term2 ] ) , and ( [ term3 ] ) , we can obtain @xmath98 hence , ( [ structureimagingfunction ] ) can be derived .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "[ remark ] from the relationship ( [ structureimagingfunction ] ) , we can observe that since @xmath99 has its maximum value @xmath75 at @xmath100 and @xmath101 , @xmath90 will plot the magnitude of @xmath75 at @xmath102 instead of the true locations @xmath5 .",
    "this is the reason the inexact locations of cracks are extracted via subspace migration when inaccurate value of applied frequency applied .",
    "note that if @xmath103 , one can extract true locations of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath104 , identified locations will be concentrated to the origin . otherwise , if @xmath105 , identified locations will be located far from the origin .",

    "some result of numerical simulations are exhibited in this section in order to examine validation of theorem [ theoremfrequency ] . for performing , we consider the detection of three different small inhomogeneities @xmath0 .",
