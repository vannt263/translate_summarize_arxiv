    "<S> ( [ ol60 ] ) shows that non - intrinsic xpc generates an intensity @xmath96 that scales quadratically with @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior can not be ascribed to the intrinsic xpc exhibited by the incident beam since the latter is due to the beam - divergence only and the consequent cross - polarized intensity scales with @xmath97 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , eq . ( [ ol80 ] ) shows two important things . </S>",
    "<S> first , we see that even at brewster angle of incidence the extinction of a @xmath69-polarized beam is not perfect , as @xmath98 and @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , although the input beam is @xmath69-polarized , a @xmath70 component appears after reflection . </S>",
    "<S> second , the two expression in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ol80 ] ) show that after reflection the cylindrical symmetry about the axis of propagation of the beam is lost and two orthogonally polarized @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes are generated . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath100 has a @xmath3 profile , as opposed to the cloverleaf @xmath101 pattern typical of the cross polarization intensity of the incident beam , is consistent with the hypothesis that such a term originates from non - intrinsic xpc and it is not a simple beam - divergence effect . </S>",
    "<S> we verified these theoretical results in our laboratory by using a super - luminescent light emitting diode ( sled ) operating at @xmath102 ( inphenix ipsdd0802 ) as a light source . </S>",
    "<S> the output of the sled was first spatially filtered by a single - mode optical fiber to prepare the input beam into the fundamental gaussian mode , and then collimated by a microscope objective to produce a very large beam waist , ( @xmath103 ) before passing across a polarizer selecting @xmath69-polarization . a second lens put behind the polarizer generated the desired waist for the input beam . </S>",
    "<S> the so - prepared beam was sent upon the surface of a right - angle bk7 glass ( @xmath104 ) prism mounted on a precision rotation stage with a resolution of @xmath105 ( newport urs - bcc ) to accurately determine the brewster angle ( @xmath106 ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the polarization - dependent beam intensity profiles after reflection were recorded by a ccd - based beam intensity profiler ( spiricon lba - fw - scor-@xmath107 ) mounted behind a polarizer put along the axis of the reflected beam , at large distance from the interface ( far field measurement ) .    </S>",
    "<S> - and @xmath70-polarized modes of the reflected beam . </S>",
    "<S> the beam waist of the incident beam was @xmath108 . ]    a qualitative comparison between calculated and measured intensity distributions is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the _ measured _ ratio @xmath109 of the @xmath70-polarization component power to the @xmath69-polarization one at brewster incidence , was @xmath110 in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ol90 ] ) giving , for bk7 glass , @xmath111 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we found that when a @xmath0-polarized fundamental gaussian beam is reflected at brewster incidence it generates a two - mode beam with both a dominant and a cross - polarized component . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the latter scales quadratically with the angular divergence of the incident beam and can be , therefore , orders of magnitude bigger than the intrinsic cross - polarized intensity of the incident beam that scales with the fourth power of @xmath8 .    </S>",
