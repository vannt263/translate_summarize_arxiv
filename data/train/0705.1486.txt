    "solving einstein s equation in 3 + 1 form @xcite requires that a set of elliptic ( or quasi - elliptic ) constraint equations be satisfied at all times .",
    "the bianchi identities ensure that , given a set of initial data which analytically satisfy the constraints , the subsequent analytically evolved variables will also satisfy the constraints . in numerical solutions of einstein s equations ,",
    "however , the constraints are not preserved exactly .",
    "thus errors will arise as the simulation proceeds , and the extent to which the numerical solutions actually reflect the true solutions of the analytic equations is an ongoing area of research ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the issue of the accuracy of the solutions obtained , there is also the problem of numerical ( in)stability , may in some cases be related to the lack of preservation of the constraints .",
    "there is active interest in constrained general relativity evolution schemes ( which repeatedly solves the constraint equations during the evolution@xcite ) .",
    "the multigrid method is a particularly attractive method to solve elliptic equations because it is an optimal method , i.e. it requires only @xmath0 operations , where @xmath1 is the number of unknowns ( proportional to the number of locations at which knowledge of the independent variable is required ) .",
    "furthermore , the multigrid method is not especially difficult to implement .",
    "we study the multigrid problem on domains with holes , because while many formulations now can produce moving black holes without excising the holes , evolution with excision in a necessary requirement for fully studying and understanding black hole evolution .",
    "for instance , posing data for black holes with kerr parameter @xmath2 very near unity are straightforward in excised data , but very difficult to achieve in non - excised data ( such as _ puncture _ data@xcite ) .",
    "it has long been thought infeasible in practice to obtain generic results which have everywhere the same order of accuracy as the finite difference scheme employed , for domains containing holes .",
    "this argument was refuted in @xcite for 3d solutions of second - order accuracy .",
    "this paper addresses the problem for domains with coordinate - spherical holes in the context of higher order accuracy .",
    "multigrid provides a simple , robust method to achieve solutions in such cases .",
    "if the multigrid solver is to be used to provide initial data for a numerical evolution code , the error of the initial solution need only be below the truncation error of the finite difference scheme used for evolution @xcite .",
    "however high order methods are still extremely valuable in this context because they require much smaller computational resources for the same accuracy .",
    "thus this high order approach may dramatically lower the elliptic - solution load in constrained evolutions .",
    "furthermore , to correctly demonstrate the convergence of evolution codes ( now typically written in terms of fourth - order stencils ) , one must have data of at least the same order of convergence .",
    "finite difference techniques to solve the constraint equations are a standard activity in relativity , and the properties of the constraint equations are well known ( for the euclidean , constant - mean - curvature background and for the signs of the solutions we use here @xcite ) .",

    "_ smoothing operator_again similar to the 2d case , we have to make exceptions for the interior points near the boundary . with regular spacing the usual estimate used to calculate @xmath66",

    "( [ x - diruneq ] ) the error during smoothing and hence the final solution near the inner boundary will be first - order instead of second .",
    "( this problem should not exist for traditional implementations that maintain a regular grid spacing . ) unlike the 2d case , we have found it essential in the 3d case to have consistent differencing order at the boundary ; otherwise smooth convergence at the desired order could not be achieved .",
    "thus , in order to maintain second - order error bounds near the boundary , we include an extra interior point .",
    "so a total of four points ( @xmath83 ) are used to calculate the second derivative in each of @xmath79 coordinates .",
    "then we solve the taylor expansions for @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85 as we can see in fig [ second - order ] we maintain second - order convergence on all points .",
    "given the success in second - order convergence we now attempt to extend this to fourth order .",
    "we find successful fourth - order convergence by increasing the size of the smoothing stencil to five points in each ( @xmath79 ) direction : @xmath86 notice that we increase the order of accuracy of the smoothing operator _",
    "only_. we do _ not _ modify the interpolation or prolongation operators .    for points near the boundary",
    "we need to include one additional point , and describing the taylor expansions .",
    "the taylor equations for the values over a total of six points can then be solved for @xmath87 to @xmath88 accuracy .",
    "the use of stencils that include these additional points could create problems with the the red - black sweeping of the gauss smoothing .",
    "points updated in the red sweep can immediately be used in calculations for other points within the same sweep . thus with these additional points gauss",
    "smoothing can introduce a bias in the direction of the sweep that could affect the error .",
    "we in fact observed this bias .",
    "we correct this bias as follows , in a sort of red - black jacobi method .",
    "we assume a red - black labeling of the vertices ( every nearest neighbor of a red is a black , every nearest neighbor of a black is a red ) .",
    "we then compute the update of each red vertex , using as many points as appropriate to the the discretization order , but these updated red values are stored in a separate auxiliary grid ( rather than being written back into the original grid as would be done in the gauss procedure ) . after all red points are updated ,",
    "they are all copied back into the original grid .",
    "then the black points are similarly updated , stored in an auxiliary grid , and then copied back into the original grid .",
    "the extra memory required to hold intermediate results is not a concern since other steps in the multigrid always require extra work arrays , which are available for use at this time .",
    "notice that we increase the order of accuracy of the smoothing operator _",
    "only_. we do _ not _ modify the interpolation or prolongation operators .",
    "a further complication is that with larger stencils of high - order methods , there may not be enough `` room '' on the coarsest grid to construct the stencil .",
    "an obvious solution is to ensure that the coarsest grid _ is _ sufficiently fine that that the stencils _ do _ fit .",
    "instead , we use the following approach : if there is insufficient room to construct a stencil at the desired order , we drop back to the next highest order that _ does _ fit . in practice",
    "this means the solution on the coarsest grid is always second ( or even first ) order .",
    "regardless of the simplifications , increasing only the order of the smoothing , and even dropping back to low - order differencing on coarse grids , this approach has yielded fourth - order solutions .",
    "figure [ fourth - order ] shows the fourth - order convergence we get with the combination of the new stencils and modified red - black smoothing .",
    "figure [ comp ] shows a comparison between the second - order and fourth - order methods of the error norms produced . we do need a larger number of v - cycles and/or smoothing cycles to get fourth - order convergence , compared to the second - order case .",
    "we have not yet attempted to reduce or optimize this , but with fourth - order convergence the error behavior is so much better than with lower - order schemes that the extra time spent on additional v - cycles is not a matter of concern .    a plot of the errors across the entire domain is useful to visualize the performance of the second - order and fourth - order methods .",
    "figures [ xy-3d - second ] and [ xy-3d - fourth ] are plot of the error across the central slice of the domain .",
    "the error is highest close to the inner boundary but the fourth - order runs contain the error to a very small neighborhood of the inner boundary , and the maximum error is a factor @xmath89 smaller than that for the second - order solution .      the work was further extended to convergence of higher order than fourth .",
    "we include additional points into the stencil to explore sixth- and eighth - order convergence .",
