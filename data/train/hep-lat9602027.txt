    "for many years now , aoki  @xcite and collaborators  @xcite have been advocating the existence of a parity - flavor breaking phase in qcd with wilson fermions as a means of explaining why the pion mass in this model approaches small values as the wilson parameter @xmath4 approaches , for every value of inverse square coupling @xmath3 , a critical value @xmath7 .",
    "this in spite of no - go theorems  @xcite that forbid such a phase in the continuum limit .",
    "indeed analytic arguments have been presented to support the existence of such a phase at @xmath8 . for",
    "finite and , in particular , larger values of @xmath3 where current lattice simulations are undertaken , such evidence is lacking  @xcite .",
    "although the picture advocated by aoki may explain the smallness of the pion masses as @xmath4 approaches @xmath7 it also explicitly states that these pions are not the goldstone modes of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this presents a problem in that it is not then clear that any of the soft pion and other theorems associated with this phenomenon will be respected on the lattice . in other words",
    "this would not be the expected simulation of true qcd .",
    "in fact the large @xmath9 analytic analysis which indicates the existence of this phase at @xmath8 also shows the non - vanishing of the @xmath10 scattering length which is contrary to the the expected spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of qcd .",
    "this is of course unimportant at @xmath8 but is very important , if true , at the values of @xmath11 where current simulations are performed .",
    "the alternative picture where the explicit chiral symmetry breaking wilson term causes the ( otherwise goldstone ) pions to acquire a small mass proportional to the lattice spacing does not have such a problem . indeed , that all these extra effects would disappear as the lattice spacing is made smaller with the approach to the continuum limit was formally demonstrated some time ago  @xcite .",
    "several models exhibit a parity - flavor breaking phase . in the nambu - johna - lassinio  @xcite model with wilson fermions",
    "this phase was numerically and , in the large @xmath9 approximation , analytically @xcite confirmed for values of @xmath3 up to a specific cutoff value .",
    "this phase disappears for larger values of @xmath3 .",
    "the schwinger model with two flavors of wilson fermions exhibits this phase at strong coupling and also loses it at weak coupling  @xcite .",
    "whereas the picture advocated by aoki does not anticipate such a quenching effect for the phase in qcd , recent phenomenological arguments by creutz  @xcite tend to show a preference for quenching of this phase if it exists .",
    "thus it becomes necessary to explore this important feature by explicit simulations of qcd with wilson fermions on volumes larger than those already studied  @xcite .",
    "following arguments presented by aoki and aoki and gocksch  @xcite , it is necessary , in order to investigate the presence of the parity - flavor - breaking phase in simulations , to introduce first an explicit breaking term into the action and then extrapolate the measured order parameter as this term tends to zero . since the extrapolation is to be done , in principle , after the ` infinite volume ' limit",
    "is taken , such simulations must be done for larger volumes and any order parameter extrapolation be studied as a function of this increasing volume . in such a situation a typical behaviour of the data at finite volumes that one might expect",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "it is expected that the functional dependence of the ( measured ) order parameter on @xmath5 be such that for any @xmath12 volume this order parameter vanishes at @xmath13 .",
    "the variation of this dependence with increasing volume is crucial to the initial determination of the existence of a broken phase or its absence .",
    "the existence of a broken phase in the infinite volume limit is signaled by a flattening of this dependence for larger values of @xmath5 and a sharper drop to zero as @xmath5 approaches zero .",
    "thus it is clear that a significant volume dependence of the order parameter at smaller values of @xmath5 is a necessary indicative factor for this phase . if , on the other hand , the approach to zero is not varying significantly as the volume increases , the infinite volume limit will not sustain a broken phase .",
    "one may use the slightly varying values of the order parameter there to extrapolate these to @xmath14 @xmath15 . if this step is then followed by a linear extrapolation to @xmath16 a non - zero value for the order parameter at @xmath16 may be obtained . at this stage",
    "it is tempting to conclude that a broken phase exists in that limit",
    ". this may be the wrong conclusion if this is not accompanied by a significant increase in the value of the order parameter at smaller values of @xmath5 . ]",
    "we report here on simulations done with two flavors of wilson fermions at @xmath17 , and @xmath18 on volumes of @xmath19 , and @xmath2 for a variety of values of @xmath4 ranging from less than the appropriate @xmath7 to values greater than @xmath7 .",
    "the choice of these three values of @xmath3 was determined as follows .",
    "the value @xmath20 represents current simulations on larger lattices where spectrum and matrix element calculations are being done ; that at @xmath21 represents a lower value below which relevance to continuum physics is not expected , and the last value at @xmath22 is to extend the search to a much larger value of @xmath3 in case the parity - flavor breaking phase were to be confirmed at the two smaller values .",
    "we introduce into the qcd action a term of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a @xmath25 matrix representing the third element of the generators of flavor su(2 ) algebra . upon integrating the fermionic variables",
    "this is reflected in the simulation by the product of two determinants : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is given by a simple modification of the wilson matrix @xmath28 as :    @xmath29 as pointed out by aoki , we also have here @xmath30 and : @xmath31    simulations were done for the parameter @xmath5 taking values ranging from 0.001 to 0.3 . for the volume dependence we concentrate on the smaller values of @xmath5 and in particular @xmath32 and @xmath33 for all three volumes considered and mostly for values of @xmath4 greater than @xmath7 .",
    "the order parameter we compute is the expectation value of the operator @xmath34 . with our notation",
    "this is given as    @xmath35",
    "for the three values of @xmath3 considered , simulations were performed , as mentioned above , at various values of @xmath4 both below and above @xmath7 .",
    "we shall present the data and results for each value of @xmath3 considered separately .    in all cases these simulations",
    "were also done at various values of the external parameter @xmath5 . for each @xmath4 the results of the compuations on the three volumes @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 were compared at the two values of @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "the variation of the order parameter with @xmath41 is then used to obtain an ` infinite volume ' limit for all values of @xmath5 used .",
    "the choice of @xmath41 is indicated here by the naive dimension of the order parameter . following this",
    ", the order parameter at these values of @xmath5 were fitted to : @xmath42 a separate fit to the pure quadratic polynomial @xmath43 was also done .    the initial aim in this case is to detect the possible existence of any non - zero constant @xmath44 at @xmath16 as the limit of the order parameter at that point .",
    "this is of particular interest for comparing results at values of @xmath4 above @xmath7 with those below @xmath7 .",
    "it is useful to point out here that in the presence of a parity - flavor breaking phase the order parameter is expected to vary with @xmath5 as :    @xmath45 this being the behaviour of the root of the cubic equation determining the position of the minimum of the quartic effective potential . in the absence of such a phase the same behaviour follows with @xmath46 .",
    "as the quartic potential becomes quadratic the leading behaviour becomes : @xmath47    this should , when compared to the data , be also a useful tool in determining which situation one is in .",
    "the value of @xmath7 at this value of @xmath3 is known to be about @xmath48 .",
    "we consequently performed simulations well below that value at @xmath49 and well above it at @xmath50 and intermediate values in between .",
    "we present in table  [ table - one ] the results of these simulations .",
    ".parameters and measured order parameter @xmath51 for the case of @xmath21 on lattices of volume @xmath36 , for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath38 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table - three ]    we show in fig .  [ fig8 ] the variation of the computed order parameter with @xmath4 over the range used . no sharp change is indicated as the value of @xmath54 is crossed .",
    "we concentrate here on the data at the values of @xmath55 above @xmath7 . using the same procedure as above",
    "essentially the same conclusion follows .",
    "[ fig9]a and b show that no significant change in the evaluation of the order parameter at the larger volumes exists for @xmath56 at @xmath40 and as seen by the overlapping histograms for @xmath57 at @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , quadratic fits in @xmath5 at , for example , @xmath58 and @xmath59 again have a leading ` constant ' that is consistent with zero as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig10]a and b , respectively .",
    "therefore , one is led again to the absence of any signal for a parity - flavor breaking phase at this value of @xmath3 .",
    "finally the obvious leading linear dependence of the fit indicates again a dominant quadratic effective potential at this value of @xmath3 as well .",
    "it is clear from the discussion above that qcd with two flavors of wilson fermions does not exhibit a parity - flavor breaking phase at @xmath60 as postulated by aoki and collaborators . since it has been demonstrated that at @xmath8 such a phase may exist in a large @xmath9 ( color ) limit , it is also clear that if this phase does extend beyound @xmath8 , it must pinch out in a manner similar to that in the njl model at @xmath61 . in either case",
    "this phase would not be relevant for the discussion of the approach to the chiral limit in qcd and the ensuing goldstone nature of the pions for @xmath62 .",
    "in fact , all indications are such that , as shown formally sometime ago , this is simply related to the approach to zero lattice spacing and infinite volume .",
    "i wish to thank urs heller for providing a modified qcd code for performing the simulations reported in this paper .",
