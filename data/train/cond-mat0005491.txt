    "the tunneling of macroscopic object , known as macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) , is one of the most fascinating phenomena in condensed matter physics . in the last decade ,",
    "the problem of quantum tunneling of magnetization in nanometer - scale magnets has attracted a great deal of theoretical and experimental interest.@xcite mqt in magnetic systems are interesting from a fundamental point of view as they can extend our understanding of the transition from quantum to classical behavior . on the other hand ,",
    "these phenomena are important to the reliability of small magnetic units in memory devices and the designing of quantum computers in the future . and the measurement of magnetic mqt quantities such as the tunneling rates could provide independent information about microscopic parameters such as the magnetocrystalline anisotropies and the exchange constants . all this makes magnetic quantum tunneling an exciting area for theoretical research and a challenging experimental problem .",
    "the problem of quantum nucleation of a stable phase from a metastable one in ferromagnetic films is an interesting fundamental problem which allows direct comparison between theory and experiment.@xcite consider a ferromagnetic film with its plane perpendicular to the easy axis determined by the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy depending on the crystal symmetry . a magnetic field *",
    "h * is applied in a direction between perpendicular and opposite to the initial easy direction of the magnetization * m * , which favors the reversal of the magnetization .",
    "the reversal occurs via the nucleation of a critical bubble , which then the nucleus does not collapse , but grows unrestrictedly in volume .",
    "if the temperature is sufficiently high , the nucleation of a bubble is a thermal overbarrier process , and the rate of thermal nucleation follows the arrhenius law @xmath0 , with @xmath1 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath2 being the height of energy barrier . in the limit of @xmath3 , the nucleation is purely quantum - mechanical and the rate goes as @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being the classical action or the wkbexponent which is independent of temperature . because of the exponential dependence of the thermal rate on @xmath6 , the temperature @xmath7 characterizing the crossover from quantum to thermal regime can be estimated as @xmath8 .",
    "the problem of quantum nucleation was studied by privorotskii@xcite who estimated the exponent in the rate of quantum nucleation based on the dimensional analysis .",
    "chudnovsky and gunther@xcite studied the quantum nucleation of a thin ferromagnetic film in the presence of an external magnetic field along the opposite direction to the easy axis at zero temperature by applying the instanton method in the spin - coherent - state path - integral representation .",
    "ferrera and chudnovsky extended the quantum nucleation to a finite temperature.@xcite kim studied the quantum nucleation in a thin ferromagnetic film placed in a magnetic field at an arbitrary angle.@xcite    it is noted that the previous results@xcite of quantum nucleation were obtained for ferromagnetic sample with the simplest form of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy such as the biaxial symmetry , and the model considered in refs . 4 and 5 was confined to the condition that the magnetic field be applied along the opposite direction to the easy axis .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the previous results of quantum nucleation in ferromagnetic system with simple biaxial symmetry to that of system with a more general symmetry , such as tetragonal and hexagonal symmetry .",
    "the generic quantum nucleation problem , however , and the easiest to implement in practice , is that of ferromagnets with a general structure of magnetocrystalline anisotropy in a magnetic field applied at a some angle @xmath9 to the anisotropy axis . this problem does not possess any symmetry and for that reason is more difficult mathematically .",
    "it is worth pursuing , however , because of its significance for experiments.@xcite in this paper the magnetic field is applied in an arbitrary direction between perpendicular and opposite to the initial easy axis ( @xmath10 axis ) .",
    "our interest in studying quantum nucleation of magnetic bubbles with a more general structure of magnetocrystalline anisotropy in an arbitrarily directed magnetic field is stimulated by the fact that the corresponding experiment would be most easy to perform and to interpret . within the instanton approach",
    ", we present the numerical results for the wkb exponent in quantum nucleation of a thin ferromagnetic film with the magnetic field applied in a range of angles @xmath11 , where @xmath9 is the angle between the initial easy axis ( @xmath10 axis ) and the field .",
    "we also discuss the @xmath9 dependence of the crossover temperature @xmath7 from purely quantum nucleation to thermally assisted processes .",
    "our results show that the distinct angular dependence , together with the dependence of the wkb  exponent on the strength of the external magnetic field , may provide an independent experimental test for quantum nucleation in a ferromagnetic film .",
    "quantum nucleation ( the description involves space - time instantons ) , being a field theory problem , is more difficult than tunneling of magnetization in single - domain particles , both at the conceptual and at the technical level",
    ". therefore , this paper provides _ a nontrivial generalization of uniform rotation of magnetization vector ( homogeneous spin tunneling ) in single - domain magnets@xcite to a nonuniform rotation of magnetization in bulk magnets with a more general structure of magnetocrystalline anisotropy in the presence of a magnetic field at an arbitrary angle_. compared with the tunneling in single - domain particles , a local tunneling event in a bulk magnet can trigger instability on a much greater scale , which leads to really macroscopic consequences.@xcite in experiments , it may be easier to monitor single nucleation events in a thin film than to detect the magnetization reversal in a nanometer - scale particle .",
    "therefore , our theoretical results for a general structure of magnetocrystalline anisotropy in an arbitrarily directed field will be more applicable for experimental tests of quantum nucleation . besides the importance from the fundamental point of view , processes of quantum nucleation and collapse of magnetic bubbles are potentially important for quantum limitations on the density and long - term reliability of the data storage in magnetic memory devices and designing of quantum computer .",
