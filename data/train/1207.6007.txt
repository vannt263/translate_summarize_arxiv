    "<S> dipole interaction is an exchange process @xcite , this regime is dominated by excitations hopping , leading to loss or dephasing of the polariton read - out @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the ability to control the quantum state of rydberg polaritons opens some interesting prospects for advances in quantum information and quantum simulation of strongly correlated systems . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the competition between resonant energy exchange ( hopping ) and localisation is reminiscent of the jaynes - cummings - hubbard model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , rydberg polaritons provide a powerful platform for studying strongly coupled atom  light interactions without a cavity , quantum simulation of spin liquids @xcite , and quantum metrology using dicke states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to control the interactions between polaritons using microwave fields allows a second blockade scale to be established . </S>",

    "<S> it is also an ideal system to study resonant energy transfer @xcite . </S>",
