    "at cdf , the search for a light higgs boson has been a subject of increasing interest and focus in recent years .",
    "while there have been numerous successful @xmath0-jet identification algorithms ( commonly referred to as `` @xmath0 taggers '' ) over the years , most have been intended for use in analyses other than searches for @xmath2 .",
    "aspects of a given analysis , however , such as the optimal signal - to - background ratio , or the relative rate of non-@xmath0 jets originating from gluons in the data sample before tagging , can influence whether a tagger is optimal for the analysis in question .",
    "traditional taggers have tended toward a higher purity and lower efficiency than would be ideal for higgs boson searches given the relatively low cross section of higgs boson production at tevatron energies .",
    "while this problem has been circumvented somewhat by taking the logical or of several taggers , a more elegant and flexible solution can be found in the continuous output of a neural network , tunable for each analysis application .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the higgs optimized @xmath0 identification tagger ( hobit ) .",
    "the strategy used in developing hobit is to build upon the strengths of previous cdf @xmath0 taggers , address their weaknesses , and construct a new tagger that is highly optimized specifically for finding light higgs boson decays .",
    "hobit produces a continuous output variable , allowing efficiency and background rejection to be tuned to meet the requirements of a given search . in the next section ,",
    "we review some of the general features of @xmath0 quark decays used by hobit to distinguish jets containing @xmath1 hadrons from jets produced by gluons or light quarks ( up , down , or strange ) .",
    "section [ sec : algorithms ] then describes some of the previous @xmath0-tagging algorithms used by cdf upon which hobit is built .",
    "we then discuss some features of the cdf detector in sec .",
    "[ sec : detector ] , followed by a detailed description of the hobit algorithm and training regimen .",
    "the performance of hobit as characterized by the @xmath0-jet tagging efficiency and background rejection rates in data and monte carlo ( mc ) is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : scale_factors ] .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "jets containing high-@xmath4 @xmath1 hadrons such as are created in a light higgs boson decay possess several features that distinguish them from jets produced by light quarks or gluons .",
    "the most important of these is the relatively long lifetime of a @xmath1 hadron , augmented in the lab frame by its relativistic boost , which allows it to travel a distance on the order of a millimeter times the rest frame lifetime of a @xmath5 ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) hadron is 460 @xmath9 m ( 501 @xmath9 m , 441 @xmath9 m , 367 @xmath9 m ) . ] . the @xmath1 hadron s travel across these macroscopic distances results in a displacement between the location of the @xmath10 collision ( the `` primary '' vertex ) and the @xmath1 hadron decay ( the `` secondary '' , or `` displaced '' vertex ) .",
    "these displacements are resolvable by the cdf tracking system , and in particular by its silicon detector .",
    "almost all information as to whether or not a given jet originates from @xmath0-quark production is carried in the tracks reconstructed from detector signals left by the jet s charged particles .",
    "specifically , it is possible to identify the decay of a @xmath1 hadron through the displacement from the primary vertex of the individual tracks it leaves in the detector , and also through the displacement of a @xmath1-hadron decay vertex formed by combining multiple displaced tracks in a fit .",
    "other features also distinguish the @xmath0 jet from other jets . due to the large mass of the @xmath0 quark",
    ", the collective invariant mass of the decay products of @xmath1 hadrons will be larger than those from the decay products of hadrons not containing @xmath0 quarks .",
    "furthermore , the large relativistic boost typical of a @xmath1 hadron will result in decay products which tend to be more energetic and collimated within a jet cone than other particles .",
    "finally , particle multiplicities tend to be different for jets containing @xmath1 hadron decays compared to other jets ; in particular , muons or electrons appear in approximately 20% of jets containing a @xmath1 hadron , either directly via semileptonic decay of the @xmath1 or indirectly through the semileptonic decay of charm hadrons resulting from a @xmath1 decay .",
    "as a tremendous amount of effort has gone into the construction of @xmath0 taggers at cdf and other experiments  @xcite , we build upon previous experience when constructing hobit .",
    "in particular , hobit explicitly uses as inputs the output of the secvtx algorithm set to its `` loose '' operating point  @xcite , the output of cdf s soft muon tagger  @xcite , and inputs to the earlier romann  @xcite and bness  @xcite multivariate taggers .",
    "consequently , it is useful to describe these taggers .",
    "secvtx is a displaced vertex tagger and the most commonly used @xmath0 tagger at cdf .",
    "secvtx only uses tracks which are significantly displaced from the primary vertex , accepted by quality requirements , and within a distance of @xmath11 of the jet axis .",
    "here , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the azimuthal angle of the track around the beam axis , and @xmath14 is its pseudorapidity defined as @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the polar angle of the track with respect to the beam axis . with these tracks , secvtx uses an iterative method to fit a displaced vertex within the jet , where the @xmath17 of the vertex fit is employed to guide the process .",
    "assuming that this displacement is due to the long lifetime of the @xmath1 hadron , the significance of the two - dimensional decay length @xmath18 in the plane perpendicular to the beampipe axis is used to select @xmath0-jet candidates .",
    "the algorithm is utilized with different track requirements and threshold values in order to achieve different efficiencies and purity rates . in practice , three operating points are used , referred to as `` loose '' , `` tight '' , and `` ultra - tight '' .",
    "the loose secvtx operating point decision is used as an input to both the romann and hobit tagger .",
    "one drawback of the secvtx tagger is that it is unable to fit a vertex in every @xmath0 jet . in the pythia  @xcite 120 gev/@xmath3 higgs boson monte carlo ( mc ) whose",
    "@xmath0 jets are used to train hobit , secvtx operating at its `` loose '' setting fails to find a vertex in 44.3% of these jets .",
    "soft lepton taggers  @xcite ( slt ) take a different approach to @xmath0 tagging . rather than focusing on tracks within a jet , they select @xmath1 hadron decays by identifying charged leptons inside a cone around the jet axis .",
    "since the @xmath0 semileptonic branching ratio is approximately 10% per lepton flavor , this class of tagger is not competitive with secvtx or the other taggers described below if used alone .",
    "however , because a soft lepton tagger does not rely on the presence of displaced tracks or vertices , it has a chance to identify @xmath0 jets that the other methods can not . in practice",
    ", cdf uses only a soft muon tagger since high - purity electron or @xmath19 identification within jets is difficult",
    ". hobit uses as inputs the number of soft muon tags within a jet as well as the momentum transverse to the jet axis of the muon with the highest - likelihood tag .",
    "the  romann tagger \" has been used at cdf in light higgs boson searches  @xcite and employs neural network architectures .",
    "neural networks ( nns ) can use as many flavor - discriminating observables as is computationally feasible ; hence the efficiency of nn taggers is equal to or greater than that of conventional taggers for a given purity . while the secvtx tagger attempts to find exactly one displaced vertex in a jet , the romann tagger uses a vertexing algorithm that can find multiple vertices , as may be the case when multiple hadrons decay within the same jet cone ( for example , in a @xmath20 decay ) .",
    "the romann tagger uses several types of nns : one to distinguish vertices which come from a heavy flavor ( @xmath1 or charm ) hadron from false vertices or vertices coming from other hadrons ; another to identify unvertexed tracks which come from a heavy flavor hadron ; and then another nn which takes as inputs the output of the first nns along with other inputs , including the loose secvtx tag status , the number of slt - identified muons , and the vertex displacement and mass information",
    ". distinct versions of this third nn are trained to separate @xmath0 jets from light jets , charm jets from light jets , and @xmath0 jets from charm jets ; the outputs of these three flavor - separating nns are then used to train a final nn whose output is the romann discrimination variable .",
    "the romann tagger not only has superior performance to that of secvtx at equivalent purities ( see fig .",
    "[ roc_comp ] ) , but also allows for an `` ultra - loose '' operating point yielding greater efficiency , particularly useful in light higgs boson searches .",
    "however , the romann tagger is not guaranteed to fit a vertex or to have sufficient input information to reliably tag a jet . in the event that the romann tagger fails to receive sufficient information from its inputs , it is unable to assign an output value to that jet . this is the case with 20.6% of the @xmath0 jets in the aforementioned light higgs boson mc sample . regardless , due to the usefulness of the romann inputs ,",
    "a majority of them are employed as inputs into the hobit tagger , which allows hobit to take advantage of the same extensive vertex information that the romann tagger uses .      while the romann tagger focuses on the vertices it finds within a jet , in the event that it is unable to fit any vertices",
    ", it is unable to distinguish @xmath0 jets from light jets .",
    "however , a significant proportion of @xmath0 jets ( approximately 20% in higgs boson candidate events ) do not contain a sufficient number of well - reconstructed tracks to allow for a vertex fit in the romann tagger .",
    "the bness tagger  @xcite uses not only vertex information within a jet , but also the properties of individual tracks to determine whether a jet is @xmath0-like .",
    "( the romann tagger only examines individual tracks based on their proximity to a displaced vertex ) . to evaluate the information from individual tracks , the bness tagger utilizes an nn which is applied to all tracks passing loose requirements , and which takes positional ( e.g. , impact parameter ) and kinematic ( e.g. , @xmath21 ) information on a track to determine whether it appears to have come from the decay of a @xmath1 hadron .",
    "the bness tagger is therefore able to extract information from all but a few percent of @xmath1 jets , and can achieve a very high efficiency for a reasonable level of purity .",
    "this robust property of the tagger makes it useful for analyses where efficiency is critical , as is the case with light higgs boson analyses or even searches for hadronic decays of heavy gauge bosons ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "a track - by - track nn very similar to that employed by the bness tagger is used to evaluate tracks in hobit ; this will be described in section  [ sec : hobittagger ] .",
    "one drawback of the bness tagger is that , like secvtx and unlike romann , it is only able to fit one vertex per jet .",
    "additionally , it uses fewer vertex - based inputs than the romann tagger , and therefore only its track - by - track algorithm is used in hobit .",

    "three of the five layers combine an @xmath38-@xmath13 measurement on one side and a @xmath39 stereo measurement on the other , and the remaining two layers combine an @xmath38-@xmath13 measurement with small angle stereo at @xmath40 .",
    "the typical silicon hit resolution is 11  @xmath9 m .",
    "additional intermediate silicon layers ( isl ) at radii between 19 and 30 cm from the beam line in the central region link tracks in the cot to hits in the svx .",
    "silicon hit information is added to cot tracks using a progressive  outside - in \" tracking algorithm in which cot tracks are extrapolated into the silicon detector , associated silicon hits are found , and the track is refit with the added information of the silicon measurements .",
    "the initial track parameters provide a width for a search road in a given layer .",
    "then , for each candidate hit in that layer , the track is refit and used to define the search road into the next layer .",
    "this stepwise addition of precision svx information at each layer progressively reduces the size of the search road , while also accounting for the additional uncertainty due to multiple scattering in each layer .",
    "the search uses all candidate hits in each layer to generate a small tree of final track candidates , from which the tracks with the best @xmath41 are selected .",
    "the efficiency for associating at least three silicon hits with an isolated cot track is @xmath42 .",
    "the extrapolated impact parameter resolution for high - momentum outside - in tracks is much smaller than for cot - only tracks : @xmath43 m , dominated by a @xmath44 m uncertainty in the beam position .    outside the tracking systems and",

    "five hundred cycles were used in the training .",
    "the training regimen used @xmath0 jets in pythia  @xcite 120 gev/@xmath3 higgs boson monte carlo ( mc ) and light jets from alpgen - generated pythia @xmath59jets mc . charm jets were not considered during training due to preliminary studies which indicated a relative insensitivity of light higgs boson searches to charm jet contamination . here , `` @xmath0 jet '' denotes a jet with a @xmath1 hadron within a cone of @xmath11 of the jet axis , while a `` charm jet '' contains a charm hadron but no @xmath1 hadrons within this cone and a `` light jet '' contains neither @xmath1 hadrons nor charm hadrons within this cone .",

    "in the event that there are fewer than ten tracks in a jet , the value of the remaining track - by - track nn inputs are set to -1 as this is the light - jet - like value of the nn output .",
    "the number of tracks which pass the track - by - track nn selection criteria is found to have additional discriminating power and is also used as an input to hobit .",
    "track selections differ between tracks used for romann inputs and tracks evaluated with the track - by - track nn .",
    "tracks used for romann inputs must have @xmath62 gev / c and be within @xmath11 of the jet axis ( the same selection used in the published romann tagger ) , while tracks used by the track - by - track nn inputs had a looser requirement of @xmath63 gev / c and a distance of @xmath64 from the jet axis ( the original requirement was @xmath11 ) .",
    "other selection cuts were considered , but none resulted in an improvement in the performance of hobit .",
    "note that one of the romann inputs used ( also used in the bness tagger ) is the @xmath4 of the jet itself .",
    "the various hobit inputs are correlated with @xmath4 , so the @xmath4 provides additional useful information to hobit .",
    "we prevent kinematic biasing of hobit by weighting the light jet training sample to have the same @xmath4 distribution as the @xmath0-jet training sample .",
    "as previously mentioned , one potential weakness of the romann tagger is its inability to produce a useable output when there is insufficient input information .",
    "this requirement of `` romann taggability '' can be a liability when very high @xmath0-jet tagging efficiency is sought . in the mc sample",
    "used to train the hobit tagger , 21% of @xmath0 jets fail to be romann taggable , versus 30% of light jets .",
    "the track - by - track nn in hobit compensates for this shortfall of romann . while jets in hobit are required to have at least one track with an evaluated track - by - track nn output , only 3.0% of @xmath0 jets and 2.1% of light jets in the mc fail this requirement , indicating a very efficient taggability requirement .",
