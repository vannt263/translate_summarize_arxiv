    "it has shown eight outbursts so far , observed with a recurrence time of approximately 34 years . the high time and/or spectral resolution of x - ray telescopes like _ rxte _ , _ xmm - newton _ , _ integral _ , _ chandra _ , _ swift _ and _ suzaku _ has allowed a thorough study of the pulsations ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , its aperiodic timing variability @xcite and x - ray spectral properties @xcite .",
    "the coherent timing of the pulsations has revealed the lack of a strong spin up during the outbursts  @xcite and a constant spin - down in quiescence that is compatible with magnetic dipole energy loss ( surface magnetic field @xmath2 g , see  @xcite ) .",
    "there is also indirect observational evidence that turns on as a radio pulsar during quiescence , although no radio pulsations have been detected so far  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the optical counterpart of is over - luminous with respect to a non - irradiated brown - dwarf model @xcite during this phase . a source of irradiation",
    "is required to explain this behavior , but the feeble x - ray irradiation coming from the accretion disk / neutron star surface during quiescence  @xcite can not account for the donor luminosity .",
    "it has been speculated that a pulsar wind impinging on the donor surface  @xcite might be responsible for the observed excess luminosity .",
    "optical modulation at the orbital period is now well established in black - widow and redback radio pulsar systems @xcite and something similar has been found for too during quiescence @xcite . in recent works ,",

    "is expected to be angular momentum loss due to gravitational wave emission and the expected orbital evolution timescale in this case is @xmath5 gyr  @xcite , which is almost two orders of magnitude longer than the observed one .",
    "this behavior might require that an additional mechanism has a strong influence on the orbit , beside the gravitational wave emission .",
    "anomalously fast orbital evolution is not unique to .",
    "several other low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , comprising both neutron star and black hole accretors , are also observed to show a faster evolution than expected ( see section  [ sec : discussion ] for an in - depth discussion ) .",
    "there is also a similar behavior in many ( non - accreting ) binary radio millisecond pulsars with orbital parameters similar to , known as `` black - widows '' ( bws ) , where the rotational power emitted in form of wind and radiation by the pulsar is impinging and ablating the semi - degenerate donor companion @xcite .",
    "these systems have a companion star with a typical mass of @xmath6 and several ( but not all ) of them have orbital periods of about 13 hours .",
    "most bws have very short binary evolution timescales too , orders of magnitude shorter than the expected theoretical values for their secular evolution .",
    "these short timescales variations are believed to reflect some short - term effects rather than the secular evolution of the binary .    for @xcite",
    "proposed a scenario in which the pulsar wind , powered by the rotational spin - down of the neutron star in quiescence , causes the ejection of the gas flowing through the inner lagrangian point @xmath7 ( radio - ejection scenario ; see also @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite proposed an alternative mechanism where the binary evolution is not necessarily driven by the matter expulsion , but it is rather a quasi - stochastic process due to the development of a significant mass quadrupole in the donor star that results in a coupling between the donor spin and the orbital period of the binary .",
    "@xcite in particular showed that the so - called applegate mechanism @xcite , which assumes that a mass quadrupole develops in the donor star due to quasi - periodic magnetic cycles , seems to be a promising candidate surviving the observational scrutiny .",

    "the deep radio pulse search was done with the greenbank radio telescope in august 2014 ( during quiescence ) to answer the question : does really turn on as a radio pulsar during quiescence ?",
    "a detection could help to solve two problems : the first is that it would allow a continuous monitoring of the orbital evolution not only during outbursts but also during quiescence .",
    "the second is that it can allow the precise measurement of the spin - down power of the pulsar which might play a fundamental role in the ablation of the companion .",
    "the x - ray monitoring campaign was made with the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , the _ integral _ and _ chandra _ telescopes during the 2015 outburst .",

    "we extracted x - ray count rates averaged per spacecraft orbit using the online _",

    "one type i ( i.e. , thermonuclear ) x - ray burst was detected and excluded from our analysis ( see figure  [ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "we also used data recorded with the _ integral _ spacecraft , which carries three high - energy instruments : a high - angular resolution imager ibis , a high - energy resolution spectrometer spi and an x - ray monitoring instrument jem - x .",
    "these instruments are equipped with coded aperture masks enabling image reconstruction in the hard x - ray / soft @xmath9-ray band .",
    "driven by sensitivity considerations , we used only data from the _ integral _ soft gamma - ray imager isgri  @xcite , the upper detector layer of ibis  @xcite , sensitive to photons with energies in the range @xmath10 kev  1 mev ( effectively @xmath11 kev ) .",
    "typical integration times are in the range 18003600 s. we used the imaging software tools  @xcite of the offline scientific analysis ( osa ) package version 10.1 distributed by the _",

    "each data point represents the averaged count rate of a combination of typical 35 science windows .",
    "the onset of the outburst , somewhat before mjd 57121 , is clearly visible in this figure .    for the timing analysis we use _ chandra _ data taken with the high resolution camera ( hrc ) with the hrc - s detector operating in timing mode .",
    "the observation started on may 24 , 2015 at 22:23:18 ut ( mjd  57166.9 ) and ended on may 25 , 2015 at 07:15:30 ut ( mjd  57167.3 ) for a total exposure time of 29.6-ks . in this configuration",
    "the data are collected with a time resolution of 16 @xmath12s and very limited energy resolution .",
    "chandra _ data were processed with the ciao software ( v 4.6 ) and were barycentered with the _ faxbary _ tool by using the most precise optical position available @xcite and the jpl de405 solar system ephemeris .",
    "the pulse profiles are generated by folding the data in stretches of @xmath13s in pulse profiles composed by 32 bins .",
    "the folding procedure uses the ephemeris reported in @xcite and extrapolates the solution to the time of the _ chandra _ observation .",
    "given the low signal - to - noise of the observations we only measured the time of arrivals of the fundamental pulse frequency ( @xmath14 ) which also prevents that pulse shape variability affects the fiducial point defining the pulse time of arrival ( toa ; see @xcite and @xcite for details of the procedure ) . to follow the evolution of the orbit and the pulsar spin we fit the toas with the software tempo2 @xcite and after obtaining a new ephemeris we re - fold the data and repeat the procedure until convergence of the solution .",

    "the poissonian noise level was measured by taking the average power between 3000 and 4000 hz , a region dominated by counting statistics noise alone . after obtaining the mean poissonian value we subtracted it from the power spectra .",
    "we used 128-s long segments to calculate the power spectra so that our frequency boundaries are @xmath15 hz and 4096 hz .",

    "it was known to be in x - ray quiescence , with the previous outburst having ended in 2011 , and the next outburst starting 2015 april .",
    "the data were recorded using the green bank ultimate pulsar processing instrument ( guppi ) backend .",
    "this combination of gbt with guppi provides a high sensitivity to faint millisecond radio pulsations  arguably the deepest search that can be done with current radio telescopes , given that the source is well outside the arecibo - visible declination range .",
    "the distance to the source ( @xmath22kpc ) suggests a relatively high expected dispersion measure ( dm@xmath23pc@xmath24 , based on the ne2001 model of @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , there is the potential for radio eclipses from intra - binary material  in analogy with the rotation - powered black widow and redback millisecond pulsar systems , where the eclipse duration is typically longer at lower radio frequencies , e.g. @xcite .",
    "hence , our observations were conducted at a relatively high central observing frequency of @xmath25ghz to mitigate these effects , while still maintaining sensitivity to the typically steep spectra of radio pulsars ( @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation ; see @xcite ) .",

    "however , the short - orbital - period black widow and redback millisecond pulsar binaries are known to show non - deterministic orbital variations ( see , @xcite ) and such variations should also be expected in the case of , meaning that any previously derived ephemeris may not extrapolate well to future observations .",
    "x - ray pulsation searches in the redback transitional millisecond pulsar psr  j@xmath60 ( e.g. , @xcite ) have established that one can successfully account for such non - deterministic orbital variations by searching over a small deviation in the time of ascending node ( @xmath61 ) . therefore , when folding the gbt radio data with x - ray derived ephemerides , we searched both over dm and a @xmath62 value compared to the fiducial ephemeris value .",
    "given the integration times of @xmath63 and @xmath64hr respectively during the first and the second observation epochs , we could ensure significant orbital coverage of s @xmath652hr orbit ( see table  [ table : obssum ] ) .",

    "it then transitioned into a faster linear decay for about 5 days when the source reached a luminosity of @xmath71 , before entering a prolonged outburst reflaring tail that lasted another @xmath72 days .    during the outburst reflaring tail , typical of all previous outbursts @xcite",

    "we exclude the presence of a 1  hz modulation ( similar to that observed in several previous outbursts ) with rms amplitude larger than 10% at the 95% confidence level .",
    "this upper limit is derived by looking at the power in the 0.0510 hz range as done for example in @xcite .",
    "the x - ray pulsations are very clearly detected in each data segment at the 4 - 8@xmath75 level , where we define the significance as the ratio between the pulse amplitude and its statistical error .",
    "the sinusoidal fractional amplitude of the pulsations is , on average , around 2% ( sinusoidal amplitude or semi - amplitude ) and does not show any significant variation during the duration of the observations .",
    "the pulse time of arrivals are fitted with a constant pulse frequency plus a keplerian circular orbit and the statistical errors on the fitted parameters are obtained with standard @xmath76 minimization techniques .",
    "since we do not see any significant timing noise in the data ( at the timescales of the observations ) and the variance of the pulse toas is compatible with that expected from measurement errors alone , we take our statistical errors as a good representation of the true _ statistical _ ones . in previous work ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "it was shown that when observing the pulsations of a strong timing noise is always observed on timescales of the order of hours to days .",
    "part of this noise is correlated to x - ray flux variations and introduce systematic errors on the determination of the spin frequency of the order of @xmath77@xmath78 .",
    "these systematic errors are particularly pronounced during the reflares when strong pulse shape variability is observed  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of such systematic errors can be estimated by looking at long data stretches that are longer than the typical timing noise timescales . however , since the pulsations available in our analysis refer only to a short data span ( @xmath79-ks ) we can not determine the size of the systematic errors in our analysis .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite estimated the average systematic error on the pulse frequency over the entire baseline of the observations , which lasted for weeks / months . here",
    ", instead , the much shorter data span implies that the systematic effect of timing noise can be substantially larger than average .",
    "for example , by looking at figure  1 in @xcite we see that on timescales of few hours the timing noise can induce pulse phase shifts of the order of 0.10.3 cycles . for this work",
    "such a phase shift would translate in systematic errors on the determination of the pulse frequency of up to a few @xmath80hz .",
    "even if our statistical errors on the pulse frequency are large ( @xmath81 ) we can not neglect the effect of systematic errors , although we can only use a rough estimate of its magnitude by looking at the behavior of the pulsations recorded during previous outbursts . the orbital and pulse frequency solution is reported in table  [ tab:1 ] .    .",

    "this value suggests that the donor star must be extremely efficient in converting the incident power into mass loss since @xmath130 .",
    "@xcite estimated that the irradiating power  kpc as determined by @xcite ] required to explain the bright optical counterpart of ( observed with vlt data in 2002 ) amounted to @xmath131 ( see also @xcite for a similar estimate made with observations taken in 1999 ) .",
    "therefore the optical data require a conversion of a fraction @xmath132@xmath133 of incident power into thermal radiation by the donor star ( the range provided takes into account the @xmath134 error bars on the irradiation luminosity and the possibility that the distance is 2.5  kpc rather than 3.5  kpc ) .",
    "since from the observational constraint we have that @xmath135 and @xmath136 is bound to be equal to @xmath63 by the conservation of energy , this scenario is energetically plausible for a range of parameters compatible with the observations .",
    "if we assume that the mass loss from the donor of is constant , then one still needs to explain the @xmath61 of the 2011 outburst . this data point deviated by approximately 7 seconds from the predicted value that can be obtained in eq",
    "( [ eq : tasc ] ) by using a constant @xmath137 .",
    "the 7-s deviation can be explained if the mass loss rate has increased by about @xmath138 during the 2008 - 2011 period , which would require a proportionally larger spin - down power than assumed above .",
    "indeed the relation between the mass loss and the spin - down power is linear ( see e.g. a discussion in @xcite ) : @xmath139 since we have seen that the donor needs to convert the incident spin - down power into mass - loss with extraordinary efficiency , close to 40% ( @xmath140 ) , then the spin - down power is larger than initially estimated either because of a larger moment of inertia of the neutron star or because the spin - down @xmath141 is slightly larger than observed . in the first case one would need @xmath142 and this can be used in principle to constrain the equation of state of ultra - dense matter ( under the assumption that mass - loss is the main mechanism responsible for the binary evolution ) . in figure  [ fig : eos ] we plot an illustrative example of the type of constraints that can be obtained when using this method for a selection of equations of state  @xcite .    in conclusion , this mechanism is energetically feasible if :    * has a neutron star with a large moment of inertia * the incident pulsar power can be converted into mass loss with a @xmath143 efficiency .",
    "when looking at the whole sample of pulsar binaries , the behavior of other black - widow pulsars can not be explained by this model since at least two of them are _ shrinking _ their orbit .",
    "therefore if the mass - loss model is correct we need two different mechanisms to explain the population of binary pulsars . furthermore ,",
    "in a recent work ( patruno 2016 ) we have studied the orbital evolution of another amxp , namely .",
    "this system can be considered a `` twin '' system of since its orbital and physical parameters are extremely similar ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in that case the orbit of the binary is varying at a very slow pace ( @xmath144 gyr ) , compatible with a conservative scenario where the binary evolution is driven by gravitational wave emission . in that case",
    "we constrained the efficiency of the pulsar spin - down to mass - loss conversion to be @xmath145 .",
    "it is not clear therefore why is unable to convert spin - down power into mass - loss whereas is so efficient .",
    "we stress that the observations of _ both _ systems suggest a donor irradiated by a pulsar wind / high energy radiation and the donor mass is almost identical .",
    "an exchange of angular momentum between the stellar spin and the orbit can generate variations of the orbital period .",
    "this variations of the orbital angular momentum are encoded in the term @xmath146 in eq.([jdot ] ) .",
    "the so - called applegate model was developed by  @xcite and @xcite to explain the orbital variability observed in a sample of eclipsing variables and then later applied to the case of the black - widow pulsar psr b1957 + 20  @xcite .",
    "the model has been then further extended to roche lobe filling systems like cataclysmic variables  @xcite .",
    "the model can be briefly summarized as follows .",
    "if the donor star has internal deformations , then the gravitational potential outside of the active star is ( terms higher than quadrupolar are ignored here ) : @xmath147 where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are cartesian coordinates measured from the center of mass of the star and @xmath150 is the quadrupole tensor ( related to inertia tensor ) .",
    "for simplicity one can assume a circular orbit ( as is legitimate to do in a binary like ) , an alignment between the donor spin axis and orbital angular momentum , and that the stellar spin and orbit are synchronized .",
    "if the cartesian system is chosen so that the z - axis is the angular momentum axis and the x - axis points from the center of mass to the companion star , then @xmath150 reduces to @xmath151 . in a circular orbit",
    ", the relative velocity can be written as : @xmath152 therefore from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot ] ) one can see that the relative velocity @xmath153 is related to the time varying quadrupole @xmath154 . since @xmath153 is also related to the orbital period of the binary",
    ", it is clear that a time varying mass quadrupole term induces a variation of the orbital period .",
    "@xcite suggests that the cause of the time varying quadrupole @xmath154 might be related to magnetic cycles of period @xmath155 ( in a way analogous to the familiar 11 years - long magnetic solar cycles ) . during these cycles ,",
    "the magnetic field induces a redistribution of the angular momentum in different layers of the star and allows a transition between different equilibrium configurations .",
    "the strength of the surface magnetic field @xmath156 required to explain a variation @xmath157 of the orbital period can be written as : @xmath158 the transport of angular momentum inside the star needs of course some energy which @xcite suggests might come either from the donor internal nuclear burning reservoir or from tidal heating  @xcite .",
    "this is in essence the applegate model which has been propose as a viable way to explain the behavior of many binary systems .",
    "it seems therefore natural to extend it to the case of lmxbs . for the case of one needs to assume a value for @xmath159 since the @xmath61 variations observed so far do not show a complete cycle . by assuming @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162",
    ", @xmath163 one finds @xmath164 .",
    "+ there are , however , two main problems with the applegate model applied to and to many other compact binaries considered here .",
    "the first is that the required b field is of the order of @xmath165 which is much larger than typical values thought to be present in fully convective stars .",
    "however , some isolated low mass stars and brown dwarfs have been observed with relatively strong surface b fields  @xcite and in some cases with fields larger than 1 kg  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent studies have provided observational evidence for the presence of magnetic activity in at least four fully convective stars , suggesting that the dynamo mechanism that produces stellar magnetic fields operates also through convection despite the absence of the tachocline , which is the boundary layer between radiative and convective envelope where the magnetic fields are generated  @xcite .",
    "the second problem , which seems more difficult to circumvent , was discussed in a critical review by @xcite , who found that for very low mass stars like nn - serpentis ( which is a non - accreting post - common envelope binary with a 0.15@xmath1 companion and an orbital period of 3 hours ) , the internal energy budget of the donor star might be insufficient to generate the required donor distortion .",
    "even if one invokes the tidal heating mechanism proposed in @xcite there would still be insufficient energy available to generate the required stellar distortions ( see e.g. @xcite ) . as was the case for the mass - loss model ,",
    "the only source of energy left is the spin - down energy of the pulsar . in this case",
    "there needs to be a viable mechanism to transport energy deeper in the donor star which is able to generate a varying mass quadrupole . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "if the donor star becomes more oblate then the mass quadrupole @xmath166 and the orbital period decreases .",
    "the opposite happens if @xmath167 : the orbital period increases .",
    "the observed behavior of most binaries considered in this work might then be explained if , for some reason , some of them ( like and other diverging binaries ) have @xmath167 whereas all other converging binaries have @xmath166 .",
    "this idea remains highly speculative at the moment since the problem of what happens in the deep layers of irradiated stars has not been investigated yet .",
    "this model could explain the sign and strength of @xmath84 in only if the donor magnetic field is sufficiently strong .",
    "indeed , the mass lost by the donor can not be larger than the one estimated in section  [ sec : ml ] since the energy budget does not allow it . as an example , we follow the recipe provided by @xcite , in which case the angular momentum lost by the binary via magnetic braking is : @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the angular rotational frequency of the donor star , @xmath170 is its dipolar magnetic field at the surface and @xmath171 is the amount of wind loss rate .",
    "if we assume that is changing orbital parameters mainly because of angular momentum loss , then by rearranging eq.([eq : orb ] ) we obtain : @xmath172 assuming that the donor is tidally locked , then eq.([eq : mb ] ) gives the strength of the minimum @xmath170 field required which is of the order of @xmath173@xmath174 g for a maximum wind loss rate of @xmath175 , even stronger than the value calculated for the applegate model .",
    "this shows that the magnetic braking model is unlikely to be the correct one .",
    "furthermore , such explanation can not work in several other binaries since at least in some neutron star lmxbs the sign of the observed orbital period derivative is opposite to that expected when magnetic braking is the main driver of binary evolution .",
    "we have studied the amxp at radio - wavelengths during quiescence in 2014 and during its last 2015 outburst .",
    "we have not detected radio pulsations and we place strong constraints on the flux density of the putative radio pulsar which , if really active , needs to be either among the 10% dimmest pulsars known or fully obscured by radio absorbing material ( which would also be atypical at the relatively high radio observing frequencies we searched at ) .",
    "the study of the orbital evolution of the system has been extended to include the 2015 outburst , and we find two possible interpretations of the data : either the orbit is expanding with stochastic fluctuations around the mean or the system is shrinking with a change of sign around 2011 .      alternatively",
    "the applegate model can explain the behavior of if a strong surface magnetic field of the order of a kg is present .",
    "the source of energy that powers this field needs to be the spin - down power of the pulsar but there is no evidence that such large fields exist in the donor star of or that they can be generated by the pulsar wind / high energy irradiation .",
    "this requires further theoretical investigation .                                                                                    ,",
