    "on september 14 , 2015 the advanced ligo interferometer ( aligo ) detected the event gw150914 , which has been interpreted as the first direct observation of gravitational waves ( gws ) from the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes ( bhs ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the event gw150914 was produced by two bhs with masses of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( in the source frame ) , at a redshift @xmath6 assuming standard cosmology @xcite .",
    "the detection of the gravitational - wave signal of gw150914 has provided the first direct evidence that black holes with mass @xmath7 exist and that they can reside in binary systems .",
    "assuming that the source - frame binary bh merger rate is constant within the volume in which gw150914 could have been detected , and that gw150914 is representative of the underlying binary bh population , the bh - bh merger rate is inferred to be @xmath8 in the comoving frame @xcite .",
    "@xcite reviews various channels for the formation of bh binaries that can coalesce within a hubble time thus becoming potentially detectable by aligo .",
    "these include dynamical formation in dense stellar environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and isolated binary evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while most of the former literature focused on bh binaries forming in globular clusters ( gcs ) , little attention has been devoted to the formation of such binaries in nuclear star clusters ( nscs ) . yet",
    "nscs have total stellar masses that are comparable to the whole stellar mass of the gc system for the galaxy , at least in the milky way , and are the densest and most massive star clusters observed in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , representing therefore a natural environment where dynamical processes can efficiently lead to the formation of bh binaries . in this paper",
    "we consider the dynamical formation scenario , and explore the contribution to the bh binary merger rate from nscs .    in a stellar cluster , stellar mass bhs formed from the death of massive stars ,",
    "quickly segregate to the center through dynamical friction @xcite . in these high - density environments ,",
    "bhs can efficiently interact with each other and dynamically form new binaries .",
    "such binaries will subsequently harden through three - body interactions @xcite . via such dynamical processes",
    ", gcs can produce a significant population of bh binaries that , after being ejected from the cluster , will be able to merge in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "over the last years our understanding of the evolution of bhs in star clusters has improved considerably thanks to numerical efforts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , the role of nscs and their contribution to the bh binary merger rate in the local universe remains quite obscure . as discussed in what follows , nscs differ from lower mass gcs in at least three important ways , each of these can significantly enhance the bh merger rate and affect the properties of the merging binaries in nscs .",
    "\\(i ) _ nscs retain most of their bhs_. while natal kicks can easily eject bhs from gcs , the natal kick magnitudes are unlikely to be large enough to eject a considerable number of bhs from nscs given the large escape speed in these latter systems .",
    "whether dynamically formed bh binaries will merge , and whether the merger will occur inside the cluster also depends on the cluster escape speed . the low escape speed ( @xmath9 ) from low mass clusters ( @xmath10 )",
    ", implies that most bh binaries are ejected early after their formation with an orbital semi - major axis which is typically too large for gw emission to become efficient and drive the merger of the binary in one hubble time .",
    "the vast majority of dynamically formed bh binaries in gcs are also kicked out before merging , but they are able to merge in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . as argued by @xcite given that nscs have escape speeds that are several times those of globulars , they can retain most of their bh binaries .",
    "moreover , as we show below , even when accounting for the recoil kick due to anisotropic emission of gw radiation a large fraction of merger products is likely to be retained inside nscs .",
    "\\(ii ) _ nscs contain young stellar populations . _",
    "the common finding emerging from spectroscopic surveys is that nscs are characterized by complex star formation histories with a mixture of morphological components and different stellar populations spanning a wide range of characteristic ages ( from 10 myr to 10 gyr ) and metallicities @xcite .",
    "this implies that unlike gcs , nscs can still form fresh bhs and bh binaries at the present time .",
    "the presence of significant additional gas not found in old globular clusters could also result in differences in the black hole mass distribution , as well as the dynamics of the underlying black hole population @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) _ nscs reside at the center of galaxies .",
    "_ therefore , unlike gcs , nscs are not isolated . in time , newly formed star clusters could migrate by dynamical friction from the galaxy into the nsc itself replenishing bhs that have been kicked out by three - body processes or by gw recoil kicks .",
    "the orbital decay of massive star clusters through dynamical friction constitutes an additional source which can repopulate the bh binary population in the nuclei of galaxies @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the dynamical formation of bh binary mergers in nscs , with particular focus on nscs which do not host a central massive black hole ( mbh ) which we define here as bhs having a mass of @xmath11 .",
    "our cluster models are based on a semi - analytical approach which describes the formation and evolution of bh binaries in static cluster models .",
    "although necessarily approximated , these models are shown to give reasonable results when compared to recent monte carlo models of massive gcs @xcite and previous bh binary merger rate estimates from nscs @xcite .",
    "we stress that although the mbh occupation fraction in nscs is largely unconstrained observationally , it has been long recognized that some nscs do not have mbhs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that nscs with mbhs are very different , dynamically , than nscs without .",
    "if a mbh is present the velocity dispersion keeps growing towards the mbh , which means that no binary will be hard all the way to the center . here",
    "we make use of the semi - analytical galaxy formation models presented in @xcite to predict the occupation fraction of mbhs in nscs and the nsc initial mass function , which combined with the results of our cluster models allows an estimate of the aligo detection rate and properties of bh mergers forming in nscs .",
    "our results suggest that the bh merger event rate from nscs is substantial , with several tens of events per year detectable with aligo .",
    "in addition , we propose a new dynamical pathway to the formation of high mass bh binary mergers similar to gw150914 .",
    "this merger path is exclusive to nscs and to the most massive gcs . due to their large escape speeds",
    ", such massive clusters can keep a large fraction of their bh merger remnants while also evolving rapidly enough that the holes can sink back to the central regions where they can form a new binary , which will subsequently harden and merge .",
    "we find that this process can repeat several times and produce bh mergers of several tens of solar masses and up to a few hundreds of solar masses , without the need of invoking extremely low metallicity environments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections  [ 3rec ]",
    "we discuss the processes leading to the formation and merger of bh binaries in the high density cores of gcs and nscs , focusing on the processes that can lead to the full ejection of bhs . in section  [ sam ] we describe our semi - analytical approach and derive the expected merger rate of bh binaries in nscs . in section  [ disc ]",
    "we discuss the implications of our results including the aligo detection rate and the contribution to the bh merger rate from nscs hosting central mbhs .",
    "finally , we summarize the main results of our study in section  [ summ ] .",
    "due to to asymmetries in the mass ejection or in the neutrino flux during core - collapse supernovae the black holes might receive appreciable natal kicks which could eject them from the cluster .",
    "thus , before we discuss the dynamical processes that can lead to the formation and merger of bh binaries in star clusters it is useful to consider natal kicks as a phenomenon that can fully eject bhs from a star cluster thereby aborting the dynamical formation channel for bh mergers .",
    "the histograms in figure  [ fig0 ] show the distribution of escape velocities from nscs and gcs .",
    "the escape velocities of gcs are central escape velocities calculated using the photometric data from the catalog by harris @xcite and using single - mass king models with a constant mass - to - light ratio @xmath12 .",
    "the nscs escape velocities ( from the cluster half - mass radius ) were computed from the expression ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the cluster half - light radius and mass ; the coefficient @xmath16 takes into account the dependence of the escape velocity on the concentration of the cluster ( i.e. , @xmath17 , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 the cluster tidal and core radii ) .",
    "the cluster radii and masses were taken from the sample of late - type galaxies of @xcite . for more than half of the nscs in these galaxies @xcite",
    "find that a king profile with a high concentration index , @xmath20 , provides the best fit .",
    "this concentration parameter corresponds to @xmath21 @xcite  this latter is the value of @xmath22 that we adopted in evaluating eq .",
    "( [ vesc ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig0 ] shows that escape velocities from nscs are substantially larger than those from gcs although the two distributions somewhat overlap near @xmath23 where the two type of systems have similar structural properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the distributions of natal kicks ( @xmath24 ; blue lines ) in figure  [ fig0 ] were taken from figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "these authors consider two different neutron star natal kick distributions .",
    "one is the @xcite distribution , the other is the bimodal distribution for neutron star kicks proposed by @xcite which has a lower peak at @xmath25 and the higher peak at @xmath26 .",
    "we also show two modified versions of these distributions ( blue dot - dashed lines ) , which were obtained by assuming that the momentum imparted on a bh is the same as the momentum given to a neutron star taken from the two former distributions .",
    "thus the kick velocities are reduced in these latter models by the neutron star to bh mass ratio @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig0 ] shows that bhs receiving natal kicks as large as @xmath27 will escape from gcs before they can dynamically interact , which will suppress the dynamical formation of bh mergers in these systems .",
    "however , from figure [ fig0 ] we also see that bhs will be easily retained in nscs even for natal kicks as large as a few @xmath28 . hence , if bhs receive natal kicks of @xmath29 , we expect that this will greatly reduce the bh merger rate from gcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as that from isolated binary evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) virtually to zero , but it will not significantly alter the merger rate of bh binaries formed dynamically in nscs unless the birth kick velocities are @xmath30 . as we will show in section [ bkick ] these basic predictions are in agreement with the results of our cluster models ; for now we note that the obvious consequence of the comparison shown in figure  [ fig0 ] is that the nsc @xmath31 gc relative contribution to the bh merger rate will depend on the poorly constrained natal kick velocity distribution . in the following",
    "we assume that at least some bhs are retained inside the cluster and consider the subsequent formation and dynamical evolution of binary bhs .",
    "after few million years from the birth of a star cluster , the most massive stars explode in supernovae or collapse directly to form bhs .",
    "if the bhs are not ejected by their natal kicks , being more massive than a typical main - sequence star , they will migrate to the cluster center via dynamical friction in a process that is generally referred to as mass segregation . in the dense environment of the cluster core bhs",
    "can efficiently form binaries which will then harden and eventually merge .",
    "a useful reference time is the two - body relaxation timescale evaluated at the half - mass radius of the star cluster @xcite : @xmath32 with @xmath33 the coulomb logarithm . on a time @xmath34 ,",
    "two - body gravitational interactions of stars are important in driving the dynamical evolution of the cluster .    .",
    "such systems are still in the process of forming a bh subsystem . for the majority of the systems we considered , including most nscs and ucds , the bulk of the stellar mass bhs are likely to have already experienced significant mass segregation .",
    "systems that lie to the left the solid black line have @xmath35 .",
    "this is an indicative value of cluster escape velocity below which bh binaries will be ejected from the cluster before merging . in systems that are within the green hatched region",
    "the bhs are more likely to merge while still inside their host cluster . ]",
    "while low - mass nscs have short relaxation times , for some of the most massive nscs the half - mass relaxation time can exceed the hubble time .",
    "however , even in the most massive nscs the bhs can still segregate at the center on the much shorter dynamical friction timescale @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the bhs will decay to the cluster core on the timescale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 the mass of a typical cluster star and bh respectively .",
    "after a time @xmath39 the bhs will dominate the densities inside the cluster core . ) and eq .",
    "( [ df ] ) are strictly valid only for a singular isothermal sphere model . ]    in figure  [ fig2 ] we plot the half - mass radius ( or effective radius ) versus the total stellar mass for various types of compact clusters : nscs , gcs and ultra compact dwarfs ( ucds ) .",
    "the dashed line delineates the region below which the dynamical friction timescale becomes shorter than @xmath40 suggesting that the bhs in these systems will sink to the center in much less than a hubble time .",
    "virtually all systems we considered but the most massive nscs and ucds ( @xmath41 ) can evolve rapidly enough so that the bhs will sink to the center where they can participate in dynamical interactions and swap into hard binaries . the formation of such binaries and their dynamical evolution is discussed in the following .      after the bhs segregate to the cluster core , bh binary formation can efficiently occur through the processes described below .    during core - collapse ,",
    "if the densities of bhs become sufficiently high , bh binaries can be assembled through three - body processes in which a binary is formed with the help of a third bh , which carries away the excess energy needed to bound the pair @xcite .",
    "the timescale for three - body binary formation can be written as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath42 with @xmath43 the number density of black holes near the center .",
    "the constant @xmath44 in the previous expression parametrizes the departure of the cluster from equipartition and we have used the relation @xmath45 in order to express @xmath46 in terms of the cluster stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "in addition to three - body binary formation , bh binaries can potentially form through exchange interactions involving primordial stellar binaries @xcite .",
    "exchange interactions can lead to the efficient formation of bh binaries only if the cluster contains a number of hard binaries .",
    "thus , this channel might be somewhat suppressed in nscs  because of the larger velocity dispersion than in gcs a larger fraction of binaries will be soft and will be quickly ionized in nscs .",
    "however , as argued in @xcite , the reduction is not going to be by a large fraction given that binaries are typically born with roughly equal probability per logarithmic interval of semi - major axis , @xmath47 , in the range @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "if , for example , we consider a nsc with velocity dispersion @xmath49 all binaries with semi - major axis @xmath50 will be hard . if we assume a constant probability per @xmath51 for @xmath52au , then the probability of finding a binary in the range of @xmath53 au is substantial , @xmath54 percent .",
    "when a bh gets within a couple of semi - major axis lengths of a binary , the binary will be broken apart and the bh will tend to acquire a companion",
    ". the characteristic timescale on which such exchange interaction occurs is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 $ ] is the interaction cross section for periapsis distances @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the total mass of the interacting objects .",
    "if the cluster core is dominated by stellar binaries , then the timescale for a bh to be capture into a binary is @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the typical semi - major axis of hard binaries and @xmath61 is the core binary fraction . by comparing the previous equation to eq .",
    "( [ t3bb ] ) we see that even under quite standard conditions ( but even more so during core - collapse ) , three - body binary formation likely dominates the initial dynamical formation of bh binaries in nscs @xcite .",
    "two - body binary formation can also occur through gravitational bremsstrahlung in which two initially unbound bhs become bound after a close encounter in which energy is dissipated through gravitational wave radiation .",
    "if a bh binary is formed in this manner it mergers almost immediately , without further interactions .",
    "however , @xcite showed that for velocity dispersions @xmath62 and numbers of bhs @xmath63 expected in the most massive star clusters we study here , the rate of binary formation from gravitational bremsstrahlung is much less than that of regular three - body binary formation .",
    "therefore , for our investigation , we do not account for binary formation though gravitational bremsstrahlung , but we caution that this process could become important in the most massive nscs . in addition , we assume that after bh binaries are formed , binary - single interactions dominate over binary - binary interactions , which will be the case unless the binary fraction is very high ( @xmath64 ; * ? ? ?",
    "after bh - binaries are formed they will dominate the dynamics inside the cluster core . assuming the interaction is now between three bhs each with mass @xmath65 , the typical timescale on which a three - body interaction occurs is :",
    "@xmath66 given that three - body encounters tend to pair the most massive bhs participating in the interaction , we expect that after a time @xmath67 the most massive bhs in the cluster will become part of a hard binary .",
    "after a hard binary is formed it will tend to harden at a constant rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath68 in this last expression @xmath69 is the local density of stars and bhs , @xmath70 is the binary hardening rate and we have assumed all equal mass interlopers .    if after a single interaction with a cluster member of mass @xmath38 the semi - major axis of the binary decreases from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , then a binary with components of mass @xmath73 and @xmath74 will recoil with a velocity @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in deriving the previous expression we have assumed that in the interaction the binding energy of the binary increases by a fraction @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "the previous expressions can be used to derive the limiting semi - major axis below which a three body interaction will eject the binary from the system : @xmath81    the binary keeps hardening at a constant rate until either gw radiation takes over and drives its merger or it is ejected from the cluster .",
    "the time evolution of the binary semi - major axis due to gw radiation is described by the orbit averaged evolution equation @xcite : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the binary eccentricity .",
    "the merger time for the two bhs is : @xmath84 comparing the above expression with the expression for @xmath85 demonstrates an important point : since the larger the escape velocity from the cluster the smaller @xmath85 , bh binaries that are produced in nscs will have shorter merger time and are therefore more likely to merge within one hubble time than bh binaries from lower - mass gcs .",
    "let @xmath86 be the semi - major axis at which gw radiation begins to dominate the energy loss from the binary .",
    "a reasonable choice is to set @xmath86 equal to the semi - major axis at which @xmath87 where @xmath88 . if @xmath89 merger happens before ejection . by comparing eq .",
    "( [ agw ] ) with the expression for @xmath85 we see that bh binaries that are produced in nscs are less likely to be ejected from the cluster .",
    "the binary will continue to interact with other cluster members until it reaches a semi - major axis @xmath90 .",
    "after the binary has decayed to @xmath91 ( where it spends most of its lifetime ) the timescale between two consecutive interactions becomes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath92 if we assume as before that each interaction removes a fraction @xmath93 of the binary binding energy@xcite , then the timescale required to decay to @xmath91 from a much larger separation is of order @xcite : @xmath94    during the hard interaction the interloper will recoil at the speed @xmath95 .",
    "thus the field bhs will start being ejected when @xmath96 , at this point the binary semi - major axis is @xmath97 . at a fractional hardening of @xmath80 per interaction ,",

    "given that @xmath85 decreases with the cluster escape speed , the previous equation implies that the larger the cluster mass the fewer bh interlopers will be ejected , in addition to fewer binaries being ejected ; when @xmath102 the bh binary will merge without ejecting any of the field bhs .    from the condition @xmath103",
    ", we derive the critical cluster escape velocity above which binaries will merge before being ejected through hard scattering with surrounding stars : @xmath104 so that for @xmath105 we have @xmath106 .",
    "the solid line in figure  [ fig2 ] shows the locus of points where the escape velocity from the clusters , @xmath107 ( see eq.([vesc ] ) above ) , is equal to @xmath108 .",
    "the bh binaries forming in clusters lying to the left of this line are likely to be ejected before merger .",
    "the approximate relation @xmath109 implies that only clusters with velocity dispersion @xmath110 will be able to retain their binaries . in many nscs and ucds stellar mass bh binaries",
    "will merge while still inside the cluster , while most bh mergers in gcs are expected to occur outside the cluster unless an initially already massive bh ( @xmath111 ) is present in the system@xcite .",
    "this result is consistent with monte carlo simulations of gc models where the vast majority of bh binary assembled dynamically through @xmath112-body interactions are found to merge after escaping from their host systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows that in many nscs and ucds , the bh merger remnants are likely to be retained so they might form new bh - binaries , that will subsequently harden and merge .",
    "it is therefore possible that bhs in these massive star clusters will undergo a number of repeated mergers and grow considerably .",
    "in addition to the recoil kick due to three - body interactions , as two compact objects merge , asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation will also induce a recoil velocity which can eject the merger product from the system . in the next section",
    "we discuss this additional effect .",
    "the gw recoil velocity of a merged bh depends on the mass ratio and spins of the progenitor bhs .",
    "hence , in order to make predictions about the distribution of recoil velocities for dynamically formed bhs in star clusters we first define the pre - merger bh spin and mass distributions .",
    "the mass distribution of bh binaries is quite uncertain . here",

    "the distribution of bh spins is also very uncertain .",
    "if the bh inspiral is driven predominantly by random gravitational interactions with other bhs and stars we might expect the spin orientations to be close to random .",
    "we note that if there is significant coherent gas accretion , the spins might align in a way that might lead to low recoil kicks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "but stellar - mass bhs are unlikely to accrete enough mass from the interstellar medium for this process to be effective @xcite . for these reasons , in our computations the misalignment angle of each bh is chosen at random in cos@xmath114 .    for the spin magnitudes of the bhs we consider two choices .",
    "the blue solid line in the left panel of figure [ fig1 ] corresponds to a `` uniform '' model in which the initial spin magnitudes are drawn uniformly from the range @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the dimensionless spin of the bh ( @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the spin angular momentum in units of @xmath119 ) .",

    "our choice is motivated by observations : typical estimates of stellar - mass bh spins suggest high values , @xmath121 , in many cases ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , equal - mass non - spinning binaries produce a rotating ( kerr ) bh with final spin magnitude @xmath122 @xcite , so that bhs undergoing more than one merger inside the cluster will have a finite spin magnitude @xcite .",

    "however , as also noted by @xcite their merger rate estimates are likely to be an overestimate of the true merger rate from the lk process as they used optimistic values for both the merger fraction as well as for the bh binary fraction .",
    "the efficiency of the lk process in inducing bh mergers in nscs with mbhs is sensitive to major uncertainties .",
    "the major challenge to this being that a continuous supply of bh binaries is needed in order to obtain a finite merger rate .",
    "in fact , a continuous formation of binaries is part of the assumptions made in the rate estimates of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "binaries well inside the influence radius of a mbh will be essentially all soft and will be disrupted over the typical timescale @xcite : @xmath284 because @xmath285 is much shorter than the lifetime of any nsc , we expect that most primordial binaries will be disrupted by now in these systems .",
    "@xcite describe various processes which may affect the replenishment rate of compact binaries and/or their progenitors in nscs with a mbh .",
    "@xcite suggested that disruption of triple stars could leave behind a binary in a close orbit around the mbh and could serve as a continuous source of replenished binaries close to the mbh .",
    "in addition , in - situ star formation can also repopulate the binary population of nscs .",
    "central star formation bursts may occur continuously ( or episodically ) throughout the evolution of the stellar cusp and lead to a steady population of massive binaries near the center .",
    "finally , nscs might result from the merger of stellar clusters in the inner galactic regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such clusters may harbor an inner core cluster of bhs that formed during the cluster evolution .",
    "if these bhs are retained in the cluster this mechanism may also contribute to the bh and bh - binary populations in nscs @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that in the dense stellar environments such as those of nscs bh binaries can efficiently form out of gw radiation during bh - bh ( single - single ) encounters .",
    "interestingly they show that most of the mergers from this channel will have a finite eccentricity while they enter the @xmath286 frequency band of aligo .",
    "this processes could become important for sufficiently large cluster masses .",
    "however , the predicted rate of bh - bh mergers from this channel , although very uncertain , is estimated to be only @xmath287 @xcite , and therefore it is sub - dominant with respect to the rate from the other processes discussed in this paper .",
    "finally , we note that @xcite argued that even the rate of _ eccentric _ mergers from bh - bh scattering in nscs is likely to be much smaller to that of eccentric mergers from bh triples formed in gcs .    in conclusion",
    ", the role of nscs containing mbhs in producing bh mergers is a subject of considerable interest , which will likely require high precision @xmath112-body simulations of large number of particles . for now , theoretical models suggest that the merger rate of bhs in these systems might be considerably lower than that from nscs without mbhs .      as mentioned above , most nscs are known to have undergone a complex star formation history characterized by recurrent episodes of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus nscs might still be forming bhs and bh binaries at the present epoch .",
    "this is different from gcs where all stars are old ( ages @xmath288 ) and many ( if not all ) bhs are expected to have been already ejected by now .    as an example",
    ", our galactic center contains a large population of young massive stars , many of which reside in a stellar disk .",
    "these stars most likely originated in - situ following the fragmentation of a gaseous disk formed from an infalling gaseous clump ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such stars formation bursts are thought to occur episodically throughout the evolution of the central cusp .",
    "eclipsing and close binaries are observed among the galactic center young stars , suggesting star formation as an additional process which can repopulate the binary population ( including bh binaries ) in the nsc @xcite .",
    "observational studies of nscs in external galaxies , including high resolution spectroscopic surveys , have been used to characterize the star formation history and ages of nscs @xcite .",
    "the common finding emerging from these studies is that most nscs are characterized by a mixture of morphological components and different stellar populations spanning a wide range of characteristic ages from 10 myr to 10 gyr .",
    "observations also suggest that the ages of nscs and masses depend on the host galaxy hubble type , with nscs in early - type spirals being older and more massive than those of late - type spirals @xcite .",
    "more generally the growth of the nuclei might be a continuous and ongoing process occurring during and after most of the host galaxy was formed .    as shown in figure [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ,",
    "most massive bh mergers ( @xmath289 ) occur at early times in the lifetime of a single stellar population star cluster .",
    "this is because the most massive objects segregate earlier and are ejected earlier through dynamical interactions",
    ". this will not be the case if the clusters form new stellar populations at later times .",
    "new episodes of star formations in nscs will lead to the formation of new bhs with a substantial contribution to the merger rate in the local universe .",
    "in - situ star formation could therefor contribute significantly to the detection rate of high mass mergers we previously derived ( c.f .",
    ", eq . [ [ ncs2 ] ] ) , although it will likely not affect the total detection rate of bh mergers in nscs .",
    "understanding the distribution of bhs at the centers of galaxies is crucial for making predictions about the expected event rate and source properties for high - frequency gravitational wave detectors .",
    "since the distribution of stellar bhs is not known , and monte carlo simulations of star clusters are still limited to a few @xmath290 particles , we opted here for a semi - analytical approach which we used in order to make predictions about the properties and rate of bh binary mergers that are dynamically assembled in nscs . in the future",
    "we plan to explore this topic using more accurate , although computationally more demanding , monte carlo simulations .",
    "the main conclusions of our work are summarized below .",
    "* nscs produce bh binary mergers at a realistic rate of @xmath291 . *",
    "bhs in nscs can experience a number of mergers and grow to masses up to a few hundred solar masses .",
    "although rare , such high - mass bh mergers at low redshift are unique to nscs , because these are the only clusters with sufficiently high escape velocities such that they can retain a large fraction of their merging bhs .",
    "* assuming that bhs receive low natal kicks , with an imparted momentum equal to the momentum imparted to neutron stars , then the nsc detection rate of high mass bh mergers similar to gw150914 ( @xmath292 ) is @xmath293 .",
    "this rate is comparable or larger tan the corresponding merger rate of dynamically formed bh binaries in gcs . *",
    "if bhs receive natal kicks as large as @xmath29 then bh binary mergers produced dynamically in nscs could dominate over the merger rate of similar sources produced either in gcs or through isolated binary evolution .",
