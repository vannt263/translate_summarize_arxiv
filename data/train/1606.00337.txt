    "recently , it has been found that realistic mhd models are required for more accurate coronal seismology related measurements where realistic magnetic field and initial atmospheric conditions have typical influence on the properties of evolved mhd waves .",
    "for instance , measured parameters ( e.g. , magnetic field ) show deviation from the one estimated by classical mhd seismology ( e.g. , de moortel & pascoe , 2009 ; ofman et al . ,",

    "extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) waves are one of the most significant phenomena discovered by the euv imaging telescope ( eit , delaboudinire et al . , 1995 ) onboard the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) .",
    "these waves are described in terms of various wave and non - wave models , e.g. , the fast magnetoacoustic wave models ( ofman & thompson , 2002 ) , stationary wave fronts on qsls ( delanne and aulanier , 1999 ) , flux - rope stretching model ( chen et al . , 2002 , 2005 ) ,",

    "the flux - rope stretching model also describes the presence of fast mode waves ahead of it ( chen et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "it has recently been found that even the fast component of the eit wave can be stationary at the qsls ( chandra et al . ,",
    "2016 ) , which is also evident in the numerical simulation by chen et al .",
    "obviously , euv waves do interact with the localized magnetic structures to exchange the energy .",
    "the large - scale wave fronts can propagate across ( or at any angle ) w.r.t the coronal magnetic field likewise fast magnetoacoustic waves , and show the reflections from magnetic field ( thus alfvn velocity ) discontinuities ( ofman & thompson , 2002 ) .",

    "these magnetic structures are basically associated with the slow solar wind in the near equatorial corona ( see the review by abbo et al . , 2016 ) . therefore",
    ", understanding its physical conditions is of great importance in solar coronal physics . in the present paper , we describe the rare observations of the interaction of multiple euv waves with a coronal streamer .",

    "in the present work , we observe two euv waves using observational data from stereo - b spacecraft .",
    "first and second euv waves are triggered respectively at 00:05 ut and 01:05 ut on 7 march 2012 .",
    "observations of euv wave propagation in the lower corona are seen in 195 euv data from extreme ultraviolet imager ( euvi ) . to understand the upper coronal counterpart of these euv waves as well as streamer oscillations , we use cor-1 coronagraphic observational data .",
    "cor-1 has a field of view of 1.5 to 4.0 solar radii .",
    "both these instruments have time cadence of 5 minutes .",
    "euvi and cor-1 instruments on board stereo - b have a spatial resolution of 2.2 mm and 23 mm respectively for 2 pixels .",
    "stereo data has been downloaded from `` '' and basic calibrations and background removal of data is done using solarsoft idl program `` secchi_prep.pro '' and associated sub - routines .",
    "the details of stereo spacecraft , and its instruments , i.e , euvi & cor-1 , are given in detail by howard et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and wuelser et al .",
    "[ 1 ] shows the running difference images for both euvi and cor-1 data .",
    "euv wave fronts are clearly visible in these snapshots .",
    "top three image panels show the propagation of euv wave fronts as seen by euvi instrument in 195 wavelength .",
    "overlaying on the solar - disk is a curved path that is the path in most visible expansion of both the euv wave - fronts . along this path",
    "the first euv disturbance shows the propagation speed of approximately 900 km s@xmath0 in the inner corona near its origin .",
    "the euv disturbance at 1.6 solar radii possess enhanced speed near its origin which is approximately 1200 km s@xmath0 ( cf .",
    ", bottom - left panel of fig .  2 ) .",
    "this amplification is obvious with height in the stratified atmosphere .",
    "however , at a given height in the outer corona , both the euv wave fronts decelerate with position angle ( p.a . ) on both the sides of their origin .",
    "we illustrate it in more detail below .",
    "we basically aim to understand the kinematics of both the euv wave fronts in the outer corona as seen in the stereo - b / cor-1 observations .",
    "we choose a circular path at 1.6 solar radii ( see fig .  1 as indicated by black arrow ) to capture the expansion of both the euv wave - fronts .",
    "by stretching this path into a straight line and stacking horizontally with time , we get the time - position angle plots .",
    "this approach is used to get the kinematics properties of euv wave disturbances as seen in cor-1 . as shown in the bottom - middle image of fig .  1 , we take the pixels of a circular path at a particular height ( here represented by @xmath1traced path 2@xmath1 ) .",
    "we then straighten this circular path to a line and stack with all the lines in a time series horizontally .",
    "the result is a time - position angle ( p.a . )",
    "plot as shown in top panel of fig .  2 .",
    "two distinct euv wave - fronts can be seen in this plot .",
    "we traced these fronts ( black triangles ) . after converting pa - time data to distance - time data",
    ", we found the speeds of these wave fronts by using three - point ( quadratic ) lagrangian interpolation .",
    "the results have been reported in bottom - left and bottom - right panels of fig .  2 .",
    "both waves were decelerating in nature with different initial speeds as they spread in the corona from their origin on both the sides .",
    "the wavefronts of both the euv waves , which propagate towards the coronal streamer situated adjacent in right hand side from their origin site , decelerate .",
    "this qualitatively suggests their interaction with the coronal streamer and other localized magnetic fluxtubes in their path and thus the energy exchange ( see murawski et al . , 2001 ; ballai et al . ,",
    "such energy exchange may cause the resonant mhd oscillations in the confined magnetic fluxtubes ( e.g. , streamer here ) , and generates the localized tubular mhd modes , i.e. , kink wave in the present case .",
    "3 is a white light image from cor-1 coronagraph formed by adding three polarization of 0 , 120 and 240 degrees .",
    "this image is taken at 01:50 ut on 7 march 2012 .",
    "we can see that the kink wave is triggered in the streamer by its interaction with euv waves . to get the phase speed of this wave ,",
    "we see the portion of streamer at different heights for a time period .",
    "we take time slices as shown in fig .",
    "3 ( top - panel ) from the cor-1 temporal image data and stack them in a distance - time map .",
    "each row of the bottom panel shows such distance - time maps for various heights from 2.0 to 2.8 solar radii .    at a given particular height ,",
    "when the first euv wave strikes , it deflects the coronal streamer transversely .",
    "streamer further tries to restore its transverse displacement towards its equilibrium position .",
    "we consider this motion due to the effect of any energetic pulse of certain duration ( by euv wave ) that bends the axis of the streamer tube as a whole .",
    "we have examined it by fitting a sinusoidal function on it ( not shown here ) , and the nature of this transverse oscillation is found to be similar as previously observed by kwon et al .",
    "this propagates as a kink wave at various heights of the streamer .",
    "similarly , when second euv wave acts upon the coronal streamer , it generates kink perturbations propagating - up . in case of first transverse perturbation ( due to first euv wave ) when it was restoring , the second perturbation ( due to second euv wave )",
    "does occur .",
    "therefore , it appears like a wave train at different heights of the streamer in distance - time maps .    for each transversal kink perturbation (",
    "first and second ) , we track it multiple times manually at a particular height in the streamer .",
    "we repeat this at different heights of streamer also .",
    "we find the standard deviation and thus the inherent error in the peak position of the displacement at various heights . in both the cases",
    ", we fit second order curves to this data . by differentiating the fitted function",
    ", we find the phase speed at these heights .",
    "speed evolution of these two kink oscillations with height is shown in top - left and top - right panels of fig .",
    "both these waves show increase in propagation speed with the height within the streamer .",
    "similar methodology is also adopted in even small - scale fluxtubes ( e.g. , spicules ) to measure the phase speed of kink waves with height ( zaqarashvili et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "we use polarized brightness images of cor-1 to obtain the electron densities in and outside of the streamer as a function of height .",
    "we use spherically symmetric polynomial approximation ( sspa ) method to estimate the densities ( wang & davila , 2014 ) .",
    "this method measures the polarized brightness ( pb ) from cor-1 observational data at defined points along a chosen path in the corona .",
    "hayes et al . ( 2001 ) assumed the radial electron density distribution in the corona in polynomial form and utilized it to the inversion of total brightness observations .",
    "wang & davila ( 2014 ) have used this technique for the pb inversion .",
    "the density distribution is assumed to be in a polynomial form , but the expression of pb is not in the polynomial form , but pb is a linear function of the coefficients of polynomial .",
    "they determine the coefficients of the polynomial by a multivariate least - squares fit to the curve of pb .",
    "the radial distribution of electron density is then obtained by substituting the resulting coefficients directly into the polynomial form .",
    "they have performed some experiment using coronal density models for the region between 1.5 and 6.0 solar radii to select appropriate degrees of polynominal as outlined in saito et al .",
    "( 1977 ) , and found that choosing the first five terms can determine radial electron density with the relative errors lying within 5% and reproduce the observed pb measurements with the relative errors within 1% . therefore , they use the 5-degree polynomial fits for all the sspa inversions in their study .",
    "this inversion method provides resonably small errors in the electron density estimation , and reproduce well the observed polarized brightness .",
    "however , it should be noted that due to the limitation that a spherically symmetric geometry is assumed for the analyzed coronal structure , the method may underestimate coronal density by 20% to 40% ( e.g. for streamers ) .    to convert electron densities into mass density , we assume streamer plasma made - up of 90% h atoms and 10% he atoms by mass . the density profile as found by this method",
    "is shown in right panel of fig .",
    "the density inside the streamer is found to be approximately two times larger than outside ambient corona .",
    "each sspa inversion for the chosen path within the streamer measures the density at various heights along with it .",
    "the relative error estimation is mentioned above using sspa technique .",
    "we have further chosen ten paths by slightly varying the position angle within the streamer ( left panel of fig .",
    "5 ) , and measured the ten values of the density at each height by sspa inversion technique .",
    "the standard deviation is calculated on average electron density value at a given height in the streamer .    between 2 - 3 solar radii in the coronal streamer ,",
    "the mass density varies from @xmath2(4.5@xmath30.05)@xmath4 to @xmath2(4.9@xmath30.1)@xmath5 g @xmath6 .",
    "between 2 - 3 solar radii , the mass density varies outside the streamer from @xmath2(2.75@xmath30.02)@xmath4 to @xmath2(2.0@xmath30.015)@xmath5 g @xmath6 . in the sspa method ,",
    "the polarized brightness inversion has minimal relative error less than 1% .",
    "therefore , the devised density in the corona though 3-d model provides its fairly accurate values with less uncertainities .",
    "we use the kink speed ( @xmath7 ) , density inside ( @xmath8 ) and outside ( @xmath9 ) the streamer to find the magnetic field strength within it at different heights .",
    "we assume streamer as a cylindrical coronal waveguide , and theory of kink waves in it ( roberts , 1984 ; nakariakov & ofman , 2001 ) .",
    "the equations that relate kink speed , densities , and alfvn speed which in turn depends upon the magnetic field , are given as follows :    @xmath10    @xmath11    here , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the plasma densities inside and outside the streamer respectively , @xmath14 is the kink speed , @xmath15 is the alfvn speed and @xmath16 is the magnetic field strength . using these equations , we estimate the magnetic field strength in the streamer .",
    "diagnosed magnetic fields along the streamer as estimated using the principle of mhd seismology are shown in fig .",
    "first ( blue ) and second ( red ) profiles of streamer s magnetic field are diagnosed respectively by using first ( during first impact of euv wave ) and second ( during second impact of euv wave ) kink wave motions in the streamer . it should be noted that both the euv waves are well distinguished in time with an approximate difference of one hour .",
    "both the magnetic field profiles show the exponential decay with a radial dependence , i.e. , b@xmath17=@xmath18@xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath18=0.54 , 0.29 and @xmath20=-2.40 , -1.84 respectively for first and second magnetic field profiles .",
    "estimation of the streamer s magnetic field profile observed with stereo / cor-1 on 7 march 2012 is performed using two kink wave episodes when two consecutive euv waves were interacting with the streamer .",
    "early statistical studies have found that the coronal magnetic field strength falls off as a function of height , with an exponent of -1.5 within 0.02 - 9.0 solar radii ( dulk & mclean , 1978 ; lin et al . , 2000 ) . in the outer corona , at 2.0 solar radii , the empirical relation of dulk & mclean ( 1978 ) gives the magnetic field value of @xmath20.5 g , while kwon et al .",
    "( 2013 ) measures as 0.6 g. our measured value , as diagnosed by first kink wave , estimates the magnetic field of 0.11@xmath30.01 g at 2.0 solar radii , while it was 0.085@xmath30.01 g as measured by second kink wave at the same height after one hour .",
    "cho et al . ( 2007 ) observers 0.4 g magnetic field at a height of 2.2 solar radii , while our diagnosed values lie between 0.075 and 0.095 g. chen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) measures on average the magnetic field strength around 3.0 solar radii as 0.1 g , while our diagnosed values in the streamer at this height is @xmath20.045 g. keeping in view the uncertainty in measuring the electron density by spherically symmetric polynomial approximation ( sspa ) method ( wang & davila , 2014 ) , and also in the measurement of kink speed , it is obvious to have some mismatch with the typical magnetic field profiles of the outer corona .",
    "however , the diagnosed values of the magnetic field using principle of mhd seismology infer average magnetic field of streamer reasonably well with the value 0.1 gauss at @xmath21 2.0 solar radii .    the power law for estimated magnetic field profile in the streamer",
    "are found to be @xmath22=@xmath18@xmath19 , where @xmath18=0.54 , 0.29 and @xmath20=-2.40 , -1.84 in the difference of one hour time epoch .",
    "it is seen that during the evolution of second kink motion in the streamer , it increased in brightness ( thus mass density ; see fig .",
    "2 ) , as well as in slight areal extent also , which may be associated with the decreased photospheric magnetic flux at the footpoint of the streamer ( poland et al . , 1981 ) . therefore",
    ", it is most likely that the diagnosed magnetic field profile by second kink wave is reduced in value within the same streamer compared to the one diagnosed by first one .",
    "this kind of fine details about the temporal variation of magnetic field profiles even in the large - scale coronal structures ( e.g. , coronal rays , streamers , flux - ropes ) can only be possible by its estimation using principle of mhd seismology .",
    "therefore , mhd seismology of large - scale coronal structures , and thus the deduction of coronal magnetic fields has certain advantage over the classical methods of the magnetic field determination in the outer solar corona by assuming it to be isotropic ( dulk & mclean , 1978 ; lin et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "additional achievement with coronal seismology is the precise measurement of streamer s magnetic field with uncertainty @xmath2310% . by precise measurements of densities ( e.g. , with @xmath235 % error in the present case as estimated by sspa inversion ) as well as wave parameters ( e.g. , phase - speed with @xmath2310 % error in the present measurements )",
    ", we can constrain more accurate magnetic field values ( e.g. , with @xmath2310 % error in present observations ) of the outer coronal structures .",
    "such accurate estimations of the magnetic field is very important as it could be utilized to understand more realistic coronal heating as well as solar wind models , and also in understanding the solar eruptions and their propagation in the outer corona .",
    "however , the utilized theory of mhd modes in the cylindrical fluxtube may not mimic exactly the morphology of the coronal waveguides ( e.g. , streamer here ) . due to this underlying limitation of coronal seismology ( cs ) ,",
    "we need more realistic magnetic field topology and density model in 3d mhd simulations of kink waves to invert the observational parameters in order to devise more accurate magnetic field . however , this work will be devoted to our future project , which will test the diagnosed magnetic field by using realistic model and observations , and will compare it with the one derived from basic method of coronal seismology .",

    "<S> the magnetic field profile produced by the second kink wave is reduced within the streamer compared to the one diagnosed by the first one . </S>",
    "<S> the precisely estimated magnetic field profiles with the uncertainty less than 10% , using principle of mhd seismology , match reasonably well with the empirical profile as well as various observational estimations of the outer coronal magnetic fields .    </S>",
