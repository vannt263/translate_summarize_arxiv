    "the efficient generation of finite spin polarizations and/or spin - polarized currents in paramagnetic semiconductors by all - electrical means is one of the principal challenges in semiconductor spin - based electronics.dassarma2004,semibook2002 for this purpose several interesting ideas have been proposed based on the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction character of electrons in some semiconductor systems.das90,hirsch1999,murakamiscience2003,sinovaprl2004 one such interesting idea is the so - called _ intrinsic spin hall effect_,murakamiscience2003,sinovaprl2004 which is the generation of a finite spin current perpendicular to an applied charge current in a paramagnetic semiconductor with intrinsic so coupling .",
    "such ideas have attracted much theoretical interests recently@xmath0 and substantial achievements do have been obtained along these lines,@xcite while at the same time they also raised a lot of debates and controversies.@xcite a central problem related to these debates and controversies is that , what is the correct definition of spin current in a system with strong so coupling and what is the actual relation between the spin current and the induced spin - accumulation in such a system.@xcite in most recent studies the conventional ( _ standard _ ) definition of spin current ( i.e. , the expectation value of the product of spin and velocity operators ) have been applied .",
    "as is well know , this conventional definition of spin current can describe properly spin - polarized transport in a system without intrinsic so coupling . however , since spin is not a conserved quantity in a system with intrinsic so coupling , the physical meanings of spin current calculated based on the conventional definition are somewhat ambiguous and the actual relations between the spin current and the induced spin - accumulation are not much clear . in fact , as has been noticed in several recent papers , murakami04,sun05,shijunren , jin05 there may exist some serious problems with this conventional definition of spin current when using it to describe spin - polarized transport in a system with intrinsic so coupling . in order to avoid such serious problems , several alternative definitions of spin current",
    "were proposed in these papers based on different theoretical considerations , which are significantly different from the conventional one and also significantly different from each other.murakami04,sun05,shijunren,jin05 another possible way to circumvent this problem is to study a _",
    "so coupled system attached to external leads .",
    "if no so couplings present in the leads or the so couplings in the leads are much weak , then the conventional definition of spin current can be well applied without ambiguities in the leads .",
    "several recent works have adopted this strategylshengprl2005,nikolicprb2005,onoda2005,hankiewicz2005,jli2005 and some interesting results were also obtained . of course , the study of spin transport in mesoscopic so coupled systems is not only of theoretical interest but also might find some practical applications in the design of spin - based electronic devices.@xcite    in this paper we study theoretically some interesting problems related to spin - dependent transports in multi - terminal mesoscopic so coupled systems .",
    "we focus our study on the symmetry properties of equilibrium and nonequilibrium spin currents and spin polarizations in such mesoscopic structures .",
    "as is well known , symmetry analysis is usually of great theoretical importance in the study of many physical phenomena , including the spin - dependent transport phenomena in so coupled systems.@xcite based on the analyses of symmetry properties of equilibrium and nonequilibrium spin currents and spin polarizations in multi - terminal mesoscopic so coupled systems , some controversial issues related to spin - dependent transports in mesoscopic so coupled systems will be investigated in some detail in this paper .",
    "some symmetry properties discussed in this paper might also be helpful for clarifying some controversial issues encountered in the study of spin - dependent transports in macroscopic so coupled systems .",
    "the study carried out in this paper is based on a scattering wave function approach within the framework of the standard landauer - bttiker s formalism . from the theoretical points of view , this scattering wave function approach is in principle exactly equivalent to the more frequently employed green s function approach in literature@xcite .",
    "the main merit of this scattering wave function approach is its conceptual simplicity , and due to its conceptual simplicity , some symmetry properties of equilibrium and nonequilibrium spin currents and spin polarizations in a multi - terminal mesoscopic so coupled system can be more explicitly shown .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we will first give a brief introduction of the structure considered and the approach applied . in section iii we will use the approach introduced in section ii to investigate whether there can exist nonvanishing equilibrium spin polarizations or nonvanishing equilibrium terminal spin currents in a multi - terminal mesoscopic so coupled system . in section iv we will study the symmetry properties of nonequilibrium spin polarizations and nonequilibrium terminal spin currents in a typical two - terminal mesoscopic structure with both rashba and dresselhaus so coupling . finally in section v a brief summary of the main conclusions obtained in the paper will be given .",
    "we consider a general multi - terminal mesoscopic structure as shown in fig.[fig : fig1 ] , where a so coupled mesoscopic system is attached to several ideal leads . in a discrete representation ,",
    "both the so coupled region and the ideal leads are described by a tight - binding ( tb ) hamiltonian , and the total hamiltonian for the entire structure reads : @xmath1here @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the hamiltonian for an isolated lead @xmath4 , with @xmath5 denoting the annihilation operator of electrons with spin index @xmath6 at a lattice site @xmath7 in lead @xmath4 _ _  _ _ and _ _  _ _ @xmath8 the hopping parameter between two nearest - neighbored lattice sites @xmath9 and @xmath7 in the lead .",
    "we assume that the external leads are ideal and nonmagnetic , i.e. , no any so couplings ( or other kinds of spin - flip processes rather than that induced by the scatterings from the central so coupled region ) present in the leads .",
    "in such ideal cases the standard definition of spin current can be well applied without ambiguities in the leads . usually ( if not specified ) we will choose the @xmath10 axis ( normal to the 2deg plane ) as the quantization axis of spin .",
    "@xmath11 is the hamiltonian for the isolated so coupled region , in which @xmath12 describes the so coupling of electrons and @xmath13 describes the spin - independent hopping of electrons between nearest - neighbored lattice sites ( denoted by @xmath14 ) in the region .",
    "the discrete version of @xmath12 will depend on the actual form of the so interaction , e.g. , for the usual rashba and k - linear dresselhaus so coupling , one has    @xmath15 ,   \\label{2a}\\ ] ]    @xmath16 ,   \\label{2b}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the rashba and dresselhaus so coupling strength , respectively , @xmath19 denotes the spinor annihilation operators , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the lattice vectors between two nearest - neighbored lattice sites along the @xmath22 _ _  _ _ and _ _  _ _ @xmath23 directions , respectively .",
    "the last term in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) describes the coupling between the leads and the so coupled region , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes a boundary lattice site in lead @xmath4 connected directly to a boundary lattice site @xmath26 in the so coupled region and @xmath27 the hopping parameter between lead @xmath4 and the so coupled region .",
    "it should be noticed that in general the tb hamiltonian will also contain an on - site energy term , which is not explicitly shown above .",
    "now we consider the scattering of a conduction electron incident on a lead @xmath28 by the so coupled region . for conveniences",
    ", we will adopt a separate local coordinate frame in each lead , i.e. , we will use a double coordinate index @xmath29 to denote a lattice site in lead @xmath4 , where @xmath30 ( away from the border between the lead and the so coupled region ) and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the width of lead @xmath4 ) . in the local coordinate frame , the spatial wave function of a conduction electron incident on lead @xmath4 will be given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denotes the longitudinal wave vector and @xmath35 the transverse spatial wave function and @xmath36 the label of the transverse mode .",
    "the longitudinal wave vector will be determined by the following dispersion relation , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the eigen - energy of the @xmath36th transverse mode and @xmath39 the energy of the incident electron .",
    "it should be noted that , due to the presence of so coupling in the central scattering region , spin - flip processes ( e.g. , the spin - flip reflection ) will be induced in the leads when a conduction electron is scattered or reflected by the central scattering region , even if the leads are ideal and nonmagnetic ( which is the just case assumed in the present paper ) . due to this fact , for a conduction electron incident from the @xmath36th transverse channel of lead @xmath4 and with a _ given _ spin index @xmath6 , both the scattering wave function @xmath40 in the central so coupled region and",
    "the scattering wave function @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) in a lead @xmath43 will be inherently a superposition of a spin - up and a spin - down components ,    @xmath44    where @xmath45 stands for the vacuum state .",
    "the spin - resolved components @xmath46 of the scattering wave function in lead @xmath43 can be expressed in the following general form ,    @xmath47    where @xmath48 stands for the scattering amplitude from the ( @xmath49 ) channel of lead @xmath4 ( the _ incident _ mode ) to the ( @xmath50 ) channel of lead @xmath43 ( the _ out - going _ mode ) .",
    "if @xmath51 , the second term on the right - hand side of eq.(4 ) will denote actually the spin - resolved reflected waves in lead @xmath4 and @xmath52 denote the spin - flip ( @xmath53 ) and non - spin - flip ( @xmath54 ) reflection amplitudes .",
    "the scattering amplitudes @xmath55 can be obtained by solving the schrdinger equation for the entire structure . since eq.(eq : swavefunction )",

    "the matrix elements @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be written down directly from the hamiltonian ( 1 ) .",
    "eq.(5a ) and ( 5b ) are the match conditions of the scattering wave function on the borders between the so coupled region and the leads , from which both the scattering wave function in the entire structure and all scattering amplitudes can be obtained simultaneously .",
    "some details of the derivations are given in the appendix .",
    "a controversial issue encountered in the study of spin - polarized transports in intrinsically so coupled systems is that wether there can exist nonvanishing _ equilibrium background spin currents _ in such systems .",
    "recently rashba pointed out that , in a bulk two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with rashba so coupling , a finite equilibrium background spin current could be obtained if the conventional definition of spin current is applied to such systems.@xcite if this equilibrium background spin current does exist , it would imply that nonvanishing equilibrium spin polarizations should also exist near the edges of such a system due to the flow of the equilibrium background spin current .",
    "it was argued in ref.[8 ] that such equilibrium background spin currents are an artefact caused by the improper use of the conventional definition of spin current to an intrinsically so coupled system , i.e. , the conventional definition of spin current can not be applied in the presence of intrinsic so coupling . since it seemed that no consensus had been arrived on whether there is a uniquely correct definition for spin current in a so coupled systemmurakami04,sun05,shijunren , jin05 , it would be meaningful if this controversial issue can be investigated in a somewhat different way . in this section",
    "we will use the scattering wave function approach introduced in section ii to investigate wether there can exist nonvanishing equilibrium background spin currents and/or nonvanishing equilibrium spin polarizations in a multi - terminal mesoscopic so coupled system . based on some simple but rigorous arguments , we will show that no finite equilibrium spin polarizations and/or finite equilibrium terminal spin currents can exist in a multi - terminal mesoscopic so coupled system .      in the tight - binding representation ,",

    "it should be noted that in arriving at this conclusion we have only made use of the assumption that the total hamiltonian @xmath96 for the entire system is time - reversal invariant ( which should be the case in the absence of magnetic fields ) and did not involve the actual form of the so coupling in the system , so it is a much general conclusion .      in this subsection",

    "eq.(13a ) is just the usual landauer - bttiker formula for terminal charge currents in a multi - terminal mesoscopic system@xcite .",
    "the second line in eq.(13a ) indicates clearly that the terminal charge current flowing in lead @xmath112 can be expressed as the subtraction of the contributions due to all incident modes ( corresponding to the terms proportional to @xmath131 ) and the contributions due to all out - going modes ( corresponding to the terms proportional to @xmath141 ) , which include both the transmitted waves from other leads ( @xmath142 ) and the reflected waves in lead @xmath112 ( @xmath126 ) , noticing that @xmath143 denotes actually the spin - flip or non - spin - flip reflection probabilities from lead @xmath112 to lead @xmath112 if @xmath126 .",

    "the arguments given above seem to be more simple and more transparent in principle .",
    "it also should be noted that , based on a similar landauer - bttiker formalism , it was argued in ref.[38 ] that the equilibrium terminal spin currents should indeed take place in a three terminal system with spin - orbit coupling@xcite , in contradiction to the conclusion obtained in the present paper and in ref.[37 ] . to our understandings ,",

    "when a multi - terminal mesoscopic so coupled system is driven into a nonequilibrium state ( i.e. , there is charge current flow between different leads ) , nonequilibrium spin polarizations and/or terminal spin currents may be induced by the charge current flow . in this section",
    "we discuss some symmetry properties of such nonequilibrium spin currents and spin polarizations . for clarity , we take a typical two - terminal mesoscopic structure as shown in fig.[fig : twoterminal ] as the example , where a ballistic two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with rashba and/or k - linear dresselhaus so coupling is attached to two ideal leads .",
    "the study of nonequilibrium lateral edge spin accumulation induced by a longitudinal charge current in a thin strip of a two - dimensional electron gas with intrinsic so coupling is of great theoretical interest because of its close relations with the intrinsic spin hall effect in such systems .",
    "it was generally believed that the principal observable signature of the intrinsic spin hall effect in a so coupled system is that , when a longitudinal charge current circulates through such a system with a thin strip geometry , _ antisymmetric _ lateral edge spin accumulation ( polarized perpendicular to the 2deg plane ) will be induced at the two lateral edges of the strip due to the flow of the transverse spin hall current .",
    "several recent numerical calculations had demonstrated that a longitudinal charge current circulating through a thin strip of a ballistic two - dimensional electron gas with rashba so coupling does can lead to the generation of antisymmetric edge spin accumulation at the two lateral edges of the strip , and the antisymmetric character of the transverse spatial distribution of the lateral edge spin accumulation ( i.e. , @xmath150 ) had been argued to be a strong support of the existence of intrinsic spin hall effect in such mesoscopic so coupled systems@xcite .",
    "here we discuss this issue from a different point of view .",
    "we will show that , when a longitudinal charge current circulates through a thin strip of a ballistic two - dimensional electron gas with both rashba and dresselhaus so coupling , the transverse spatial distribution of the induced nonequilibrium lateral edge spin accumulation ( polarized perpendicular to the 2deg plane ) are in general non - antisymmetric .",
    "the non - antisymmetric character of the lateral edge spin accumulation contradicts seriously with the usual physical pictures of spin hall effect , though according to some theoretical predictions , intrinsic spin hall effect should also survive in the presence of both rashba and dresselhaus so coupling@xcite .",
    "the non - antisymmetric character of the lateral edge spin accumulation implies that , in addition to the intrinsic spin hall effect , there may exist some other physical reasons that might also lead to the generation of nonequilibrium lateral edge spin accumulation in a so coupled system ( with a thin strip geometry ) when a longitudinal charge current circulates through it.@xcite    firstly let us look at what symmetry relations can be obtained for the nonequilibrium lateral edge spin accumulation induced by a longitudinal charge current based on the symmetry analysis of the hamiltonian of the system under study ( sketched in fig.2 ) .",
    "if only rashba ( or only dresselhaus ) so coupling presents , based on the symmetry properties of the hamiltonian of the structure under study , one can show rigorous that the nonequilibrium lateral edge spin accumulation does should be antisymmetric at the two lateral edges .",
    "let us consider first the case in which only rashba so coupling presents ( i.e. , the dresselhaus so coupling strength is zero ) .",
    "if only rashba so coupling presents , from eq.(2a ) and fig.2 one can see that the hamiltonian of the entire structure is invariant under the combined transformation of the real space reflection @xmath151 and the spin space rotation around the @xmath152 axis ( with an angle @xmath153 ) . from this invariance",
    "one can get immediately that @xmath154 , where @xmath155 denotes the nonequilibrium spin density induced by a longitudinal charge current flowing from lead 1 to lead 2 .",
