    "the coherent control of a two - level atom in free space with resonant laser fields is important both from a fundamental as well as a practical standpoint . in particular , for quantum information processing purposes , where the two - level atom encodes a single quantum bit ( qubit ) , coherent control accuracy plays a crucial role .",
    "fault - tolerant quantum error correction schemes , necessary for large scale quantum computing , demand that the error in a single quantum gate is below a certain , typically very small , threshold @xcite .    in recent years",
    "the fundamental limitation to qubit control accuracy imposed by the quantum nature of the control light fields has been the focus of several studies @xcite . for a coherent state of light ( cl ) , where both phase and amplitude fluctuations are at the standard quantum limit ( sql ) , it was found that the gate error is determined by the qubit spontaneous decay rate . at a time shorter than the qubit decay time , part of that error can be interpreted as due to entanglement between the control field mode and the qubit ( forward scattering ) .",
    "this entanglement is a measure of the information on the atomic state carried away by the pulse field and could , in principle , be exploited as a resource in quantum communication schemes . for a cl pulse of duration @xmath0 , the entanglement , measured by the tangle @xmath1 ,",
    "was found to be @xcite , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the average number of photons in the pulse .",
    "thus , in agreement with the correspondence principle , quantum entanglement becomes very small as the pulse approaches the classical limit , i.e. @xmath4 .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether a control with non coherent light field states would reduce or increase both the operation error and atom - light mode entanglement . in this paper",
    "we investigate the fundamental quantum limitation to the fidelity of qubit coherent control with squeezed light ( sl ) fields .",
    "as opposed to cl , sl has phase - dependent quantum fluctuations , where one field quadrature has reduced and the other increased fluctuations compared with the sql .",
    "reduced phase fluctuations of squeezed light have been shown to , in principle , improve the fundamental limitation to phase metrology accuracy @xcite .",
    "the use of squeezed light states was also shown to be beneficial for continuous variable quantum key distribution @xcite . here",
    ", we explore the possible advantage of the use of squeezed light for qubit coherent control .",
    "both the error of a single - qubit quantum gate and the entanglement between the atomic qubit and the sl mode are calculated .",
    "atom - sl interactions were studied extensively in the past @xcite . in most cases",
    "the atomic dynamics was found to be modified in a squeezing - phase - dependent way .",
    "gardiner @xcite found that a two - level atom damped by a squeezed vacuum reservoir exhibits squeezing - phase - dependent suppression or enhancement of atomic coherence decay .",
    "carmichael @xcite added a coherent field that drives the atom and showed that the dynamics of the atomic coherence depends on the squeezed vacuum and the coherent driving field relative phase .",
    "both assumed a broadband squeezed vacuum reservoir whereas the finite bandwidth case was studied in @xcite .",
    "milburn , on the other hand , studied the interaction of a single - mode sl with an atom using the janes - cummings model and found a squeezing - phase - dependent increase or decrease of the collapse time @xcite .    here",
    "we assume a qubit that is encoded in an atomic , two - level , superposition and a control field that is realized with a pulse of sl in a single electromagnetic ( em ) field mode and of duration shorter than the typical atomic decay time , in free space .",
    "we find that the squeezing phase , the phase of the light field and the atomic superposition phase , all determine whether atom - pulse mode entanglement and the gate error are enhanced or suppressed .",
    "it is found that , although reduced for certain qubit initial states , when averaged over all possible states the minimal gate error is comparable to that with cl fields .",

    "we briefly describe the paraxial model following a similar approach to that in @xcite .",

    "the pulse is assumed to propagate with a small diffraction angle , so that the paraxial approximation is valid . a natural description for such a pulse is as a superposition of gaussian beams with a well - defined transverse area @xmath10 at the position of the atom , each with wave number @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , analogous to a narrowband wave packet of fourier modes in 1d .",
    "in this approximation the pulse is effectively a one - dimensional beam with transverse area @xmath10 similar to a gaussian beam .",

    "we wish to analyze and calculate the error caused by quantum fluctuations as well as the degree of atom - pulse mode entanglement . the model outlined in sec .",
    "ii is sufficiently general to describe a pulse in any quantum state and its interaction with the atom . in @xcite calculations for cl state",

    "iii b we consider a rotation of the bloch vector by 180 degrees about an axis lying in the bloch sphere equatorial plane ( a @xmath35 pulse ) as an example and neglect the reservoir ( i.e. the rest of the em modes ) .",
    "this allows to obtain analytic expressions for the atom - pulse entanglement which , in this case , is the sole generator of gate error . for longer pulses ,",
    "reservoir effects become increasingly dominant for both entanglement and error generation . in sec .",
    "iii c we obtain the results in the presence of the reservoir , i.e. including spontaneous emission into all modes .      in order to determine the final state of the bipartite photon pulse - atom system in the presence of the reservoir of free em modes , an appropriate master equation should be used .      here",
    "we assume the light mode @xmath27 to be a single pulse mode in a squeezed state and choose the following initial state for the em field @xmath36 here @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the squeezing operator with the squeezing parameter @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the displacement operator with the field average @xmath41 .",
    "the phases @xmath42 and @xmath43 together with the phases associated with the initial state of the atomic qubit will play an important role in the following .",
    "it is convenient to transform the problem into a representation where the initial state of the pulse mode is the vacuum state . to achieve this",

    ". here however , such terms appear as a result of squeezing , and indeed vanish for @xmath52 .",
    "these terms reflect the fact that unlike the ordinary vacuum the squeezed vacuum contains photons that can be absorbed by the atom .",

    "in fact , in @xcite it was found that the assumption @xmath67 is actually a necessary _ condition _ for the validity of the markovian assumption and the master equation ( [ master ] ) , together with the condition @xmath68 .",
    "an intuitive argument for the requirement @xmath67 can be based on the time scales related to the pulse mode that is excluded from the reservoir .",
    "while the correlation time of the reservoir is @xmath0 , this correlation s effect on the dynamics should be of the order of @xmath69 .",
    "therefore markovian dynamics is obtained by requiring @xmath66 .",

    "the probability to absorb a photon from the pulse and then to emit one to the reservoir is negligible .",
    "then , one can indeed neglect any modification to the atom - pulse entanglement due to the presence of the reservoir .",
    "however , gate error calculated in this approximation is induced only by the quantum fluctuations of the pulse mode .",

    "for fixed pulse phase , the change in entanglement for initial states that lie in the bloch sphere equatorial @xmath110 plane depends on the difference between the squeezing phase and @xmath111 .",

    "we thus expect to get a lower error in this operation as compared with the cl operation . for @xmath103",
    ", the field has an increased amplitude noise ( @xmath188 ) , which results an increased error compared to the cl case . now consider the @xmath53 axis pointing initial state again for @xmath76 .",
    "since the rabi vector is also pointing to the @xmath53 direction the average `` moment '' obtained from the cross product is zero . here",
    "only the @xmath189 `` phase '' noise , in the @xmath112 direction , affects the qubit state .",
    "when this noise is increased ( @xmath102 ) the error is larger than in the cl case , and when it is reduced ( @xmath103 ) the error gets lower . for an initial state pointing to the @xmath112 direction",
    ", one can see that in general , both @xmath182 and @xmath181 affect the operation , and therefore squeezing in any quadrature typically increases the operation error .",
    "we now wish to examine how accounting for the spontaneous emission into the reservoir of empty modes will modify the above results . to this end",
    "the full master equation , eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) , has to be solved .",
    "we again assume @xmath79 and work in the truncated basis @xmath88 .",
    "we solve eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) numerically in this basis using @xmath106 and calculate the density matrix @xmath73 of the bipartite final state .",
    "we then use @xmath73 to evaluate the tangle and the error probability .      within the truncated basis ,",
    "the pulse mode is also a two - level system .",
    "we follow @xcite where a procedure for the tangle calculation of a two - qubit mixed state is given .",
    "figure [ tir ] presents the tangle as a function of the pulse duration @xmath0 .",
    "we assume squeezing of @xmath108 , which corresponds to @xmath190 pulse mode quadrature noise reduction .",
    "the interaction with the reservoir changes atom - pulse entanglement when @xmath191 and should generally decrease it for @xmath192 . whenever the tangle is not suppressed by the sl operation",
    ", pulses shorter than @xmath193 are well accounted by neglecting the reservoir , i.e. extending the initial linear part of the plots . when sl operation suppresses the entanglement ,",
    "the interaction with the reservoir becomes more dominant , and the effect of the reservoir can only be neglected for pulses shorter than @xmath194 .",
    "the error probability is calculated using eq .",
    "( [ per ] ) .",
    "figure [ pir ] shows the results for @xmath105 pulse duration .",
    "let us now compare between fig .",
    "[ pir ] and fig .",
    "2 , where the reservoir has been neglected .",
    "we focus on the case of the initial state @xmath195 . for @xmath52 ,",
    "i.e. a cl pulse , the error of about @xmath196 seen in the left hand part of fig .",
    "[ pir ] is actually due to spontaneous emission to all the em modes , as can be understood from the mollow picture ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the corresponding error in fig .",
    "2 is only @xmath197 .",
    "this suggests that owing to its small solid angle ( @xmath106 ) , the error due to coupling to the laser mode is overwhelmed by that due to coupling to the reservoir modes .",
    "when squeezing is introduced ( @xmath198 ) , for @xmath103 , the atom - pulse entanglement is suppressed as seen in fig .",
    "this suppression is hardly noticeable when the reservoir modes are included as one can see from fig .",
    "[ pir ] . numerically , for @xmath199 , we find that the error decrease is @xmath200 .",
    "this matches what could be expected from fig . 2 and demonstrates that the reservoir is the major cause of error in this case . on the other hand , for @xmath102 , an increase of the error seen in fig .",
    "2 persists also in the presence of the reservoir , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ pir ] . for very large",
    "squeezing this increase may become of the same order of magnitude as the error due to the spontaneous emission to all the em modes .",
    "e.g. for @xmath199 the increase seen in both figs .",
    "2 and [ pir ] is @xmath201 , about @xmath202 of the @xmath196 error induced by spontaneous emission .",
    "the results of sec .",
    "iii show that the entanglement between the pulse mode and the atom is indeed modified in a squeezing - phase - dependent way .",
    "however , the use of squeezed light would not reduce the average error compared with the cl case by a practicably useful amount . despite its inapplicability for quantum computing , the entanglement between sl and a single atom is of scientific interest , and would be interesting if observed experimentally .",
    "contrary to cl , where atom - light entanglement is probably too small to be detected , sl with a large squeezing parameter @xmath80 and a right choice of phases , will eventually enhance sl - atom entanglement to experimentally detectable values .",
    "a direct measurement of entanglement would be through complete state tomography of the combined sl - atom state .",
    "the tangle would then be calculated from the reconstructed density matrix .",
    "the requirements for this experiment would be a squeezed light source with a sufficiently large squeezing parameter @xcite , atomic state detection and photodetectors with sufficient efficiency . alternatively , ignoring the light mode , the error in the final atomic state can be measured for various parameters , such as different squeezing phases , thus relaxing the need for an efficient photodetector .",
    "examples for squeezed light sources include four wave mixing in a nonlinear medium , optical parametric amplifiers , second harmonic generation and amplitude squeezed light from diode lasers among others @xcite .",
    "all these sources can be pulsed , e.g. via electro - optic modulators .",
    "the initial light state we assumed for the control field was a single - mode squeezed state .",
    "parametric down conversion ( pdc ) of short pulses could be considered as one example of a realization for such a light source . in @xcite",
    "the multimode pulsed sl produced by pdc is analyzed and described by a discrete set of squeezed modes .",
    "in fact , for some conditions of phase matching and pump pulse duration , only one of the modes of the discrete set is squeezed , resulting in a pulse in a single - mode squeezed state .",
    "even the most advanced single - mode squeezed light sources to - date can not reach quadrature noise suppression greater than @xmath203db ( @xmath108 ) @xcite .",
    "this means that the maximal error increase and tangle expected and therefore the minimal required detection error , will be of the order of a few @xmath204 ( see fig . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "current state - of - the - art atomic state detection has an error which is of similar magnitude @xcite .",
    "however the efficiency of even the most advanced photodetectors is far from satisfying such low error rates .",
    "it therefore seems that a direct tangle measurement is currently unfeasible , however , an indirect indication for entanglement , detected through gate error enhancement , is within experimental reach .",
    "one important limitation for observing the error modification effects in free space is the spacial overlap between the atom and the paraxial pulse mode .",
    "similar limitations make up a major difficulty in observing the effect of the inhibition of the atom coherences decay in a squeezed vacuum reservoir , found by gardiner @xcite . in this context , other schemes , involving atom - squeezed vacuum interaction in a cavity ,",
    "were considered @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical analysis and experiment however have shown a possibility of strong coupling of a laser mode to a single atom in free space @xcite .",
    "the use of such beams , where the overlap between the incoming beam and the atomic dipole radiation pattern is large ( @xmath205 ) , may greatly enhance the effects discussed above .    in many experiments , a pair of ground , e.g. hyperfine ,",
    "states of an atomic system is used as a qubit .",
    "although the energy separation between ground states is typically in the radio - frequency range , quantum gates are often driven with a laser beam pair , off - resonance with a third optically excited level , in a raman configuration .",
    "the limitations to hyperfine qubit coherence and gate fidelity due to the quantum nature of the raman laser fields was investigated both experimentally and theoretically @xcite . in this case too , it is interesting to ask whether the use of , either independently or relatively , squeezed light fields would influence the gate error .",
    "an experiment , similar to that described above , but with a ground state qubit could benefit from the ground state qubit intrinsic longevity .",
    "in fact , a gate averaged error of few @xmath206 , dominated by laser classical noise and photon scattering , was recently measured on a single trapped - ion hyperfine qubit and a raman laser gate @xcite .",
    "+ to conclude , we have calculated the entanglement between a short pulse of resonant squeezed light and a two - level atom in free space during a qubit @xmath207 gate ( a @xmath35 pulse ) and the resulting gate error .",
    "several differences arise when comparing to coherent control with cl .",
    "as could be expected for squeezed light , three phases determine the error magnitude - the squeezing phase , the light phase and the phase of the initial qubit superposition . in comparison with the coherent light case , the error and the entanglement can be either enhanced or suppressed depending on the above phase relations .",
    "these entanglement enhancement and suppression effects naturally become stronger with squeezing and can get to a few orders of magnitude . for quantum information processing purposes the relevant error is that averaged over all possible initial states .",
    "we have shown that although in principal the average error can be reduced by using sl within a specific range of parameters , the resulting minimum error however would be of the same order of magnitude as that with cl .",
    "in fact , even when not averaged , but when taking into account the free space environment , the error is still mostly dominated by the atomic decay to the em reservoir owing to a very small atom - pulse spacial overlap , so that any reduction is not likely do be detected experimentally . on the other hand , the effect of enhanced atom - pulse entanglement is of scientific interest and might even prove useful as a resource in some quantum communication schemes .",
    "a measurement of the increased error would be an indirect indication for the enhancement of entanglement by squeezing .",
    "we appreciate useful discussions with ilya averbukh , eran ginossar and barak dayan .",
    "ro acknowledges support from the isf morasha program , the chais family fellow program and the minerva foundation .",
    "here we would like to derive the model hamiltonian of the atom - pulse mode interaction in free space seen in eq .",
    "( [ h_i ] ) .",
    "we start from the usual atom - field hamiltonian in the dipole approximation @xmath208 where @xmath18 are the indices of a fourier mode and its polarization respectively , and @xmath6 is the position of the atom .",
    "the dipole matrix element @xmath209 is assumed to be real and @xmath210 , where @xmath211 is the polarization vector with polarization @xmath212 and is perpendicular to the propagation direction @xmath213 .",
    "we first divide the sums on fourier modes into the paraxial subspace modes , @xmath214 , and the nonparaxial subspace modes .",
    "the paraxial subspace modes include the modes centered around some carrier wave vector in the @xmath5 direction @xmath7 : @xmath215 where the bandwidths for ( x , y , z ) directions are narrow , i.e. @xmath216 the nonparaxial modes are simply the rest of the modes @xmath217 not included in @xmath214 and we denote them with indices @xmath218 .",
    "the paraxial subspace @xmath214 can be approximately spanned by the modes which are the solutions of the paraxial wave equations in free space with carrier frequencies @xmath219 , @xmath220 . these modes are denoted by the functions @xmath221 .",
    "their fourier coefficients are @xmath222 so that their mode operators are @xmath223 note that the fourier modes here , @xmath224 , are only those included in the paraxial subspace . using ( [ a_nmk ] )",
    "it is easy to show within the paraxial approximation that @xmath225 where @xmath226 .",
    "we denote all the @xmath227 and @xmath228 modes by @xmath229 , where @xmath230 are the two polarizations .",
    "the rest of the modes , @xmath231 , have gaussian transverse profile and are denoted @xmath232 .",
    "we thus get @xmath233 where @xmath234 and @xmath235 , @xmath236 are the atom - mode dipole couplings for the modes @xmath237 .",
    "the dipole couplings for the @xmath232 modes are seen explicitly in ( [ h_tot_gk ] ) , @xmath238 we note that @xmath239 is just the overlap of the @xmath240 mode with the atom .",
    "this overlap includes some normalization of a quantization length in the beam direction , @xmath241 , which should eventually be taken to be infinity , and which is multiplied by some effective area of the mode , @xmath10 , evaluated at the atom s position , i.e. @xmath242 . considering the narrow band of @xmath240 values around @xmath243 , @xmath10 is approximately independent of @xmath240 .",
    "the couplings @xmath244 are then written @xmath245 as for @xmath246 , since all the modes discussed here , @xmath247 , are eigenmodes of free space in the paraxial approximation , they have well - defined single - particle energies @xmath248 , @xmath249 and @xmath250 respectively . the total hamiltonian from eq .",
    "( [ h_tot_k ] ) thus becomes @xmath251 we would now like to describe a pulse mode with a gaussian transverse profile composed of gaussian beams of different frequencies around the carrier frequency @xmath252 .",
    "the pulse mode is then spanned by the @xmath232 modes .",
    "we can choose a new orthonormal basis @xmath253 which spans the same subspace as that of the @xmath232 basis and that includes a pulse mode @xmath27 as one of its members .",
    "both @xmath232 and @xmath253 modes share a similar gaussian @xmath110 profile , we therefore focus only on their @xmath5 dependence .",
    "we write the relation between the @xmath240 and @xmath254 mode functions as @xmath255 where @xmath256 is a @xmath240 mode while @xmath257 is an @xmath254 mode .",
    "an @xmath254 mode is thus defined by its envelope @xmath258 . in a similar way ,",
    "the transformation for the field operators is @xmath259 the pulse mode is then characterized by the operator @xmath16 , whereas the hilbert space of the two - level atom is spanned by the pauli spin matrices .",
    "the atom and the pulse mode make for the relevant bipartite system .",
    "the rest of the em modes , @xmath260 , @xmath261 and @xmath262 , interact with the bipartite system via the atom and make up a reservoir .",
    "we now focus on the part of the hamiltonian that includes only the atom and the gaussian paraxial modes @xmath232 , and their interaction @xmath263 moving to the interaction picture in the rotating wave approximation , assuming no detuning ( @xmath264 ) and using equations ( [ g_k ] , [ phi_f ] , [ a_f ] ) , we get @xmath265 , \\label{a6}\\ ] ] with @xmath266 the system hamiltonian of the relevant bipartite system comprised of the atom and the pulse mode is then @xmath267 , \\label{a8}\\ ] ] where we take the envelope of the pulse , @xmath13 , to be real and set @xmath32 . denoting all the rest the em modes apart from @xmath27 with indices @xmath26 we get the total hamiltonian in the interaction picture in eq .",
