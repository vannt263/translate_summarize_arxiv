    "it is theoretically argued that the heavy mass of the @xmath0 meson , which is around @xmath3 , originates from the interplay between the @xmath1 anomaly in quantum chromodynamics and the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when chiral symmetry is partially restored at finite density , the mass is expected to be reduced .",
    "for example , @xmath4 mass reduction at the normal nuclear density is estimated in the nambu  jona - lasinio model calculation  @xcite , and a recent calculation using the linear sigma model predicts @xmath5 reduction  @xcite . in the qmc ( quark - meson coupling )",
    "model , a rather small mass reduction of @xmath6 is predicted for the case of an @xmath7-@xmath0 mixing angle of @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the mass reduction at finite density is , in other words , the outcome of an attractive interaction between an @xmath0 meson and a nucleus .",
    "if the attraction is strong enough , an @xmath0-nucleus bound state may be formed .",
    "for the experimental observation of such a bound state , the decay width is one of the important ingredients .",
    "the chiral unitary model including a lagrangian term which couples the singlet meson to the baryons indicates that the real part of the optical potential is in general deeper than the imaginary part , while the coupling constant is an unknown parameter  @xcite .    from the experimental side ,",
    "two kinds of measurements , @xmath0 photoproduction off nuclei  @xcite and @xmath0 production in proton - proton collision  @xcite , have been used to extract the information on @xmath0-nucleus interaction and @xmath0-nucleon interaction , respectively , by taking different approaches .",
    "the cbelsa / taps experiment determined both the real part  @xcite and the imaginary part  @xcite of the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential . the imaginary part , which is half of the absorption width , was obtained to be @xmath9 through a measurement of the transparency ratios for different nuclear targets  @xcite .",
    "in addition , by comparing the excitation function and the momentum distribution of @xmath0 mesons for the photoproduction off carbon with corresponding theoretical calculations , the real part was derived as @xmath10  @xcite . through these studies",
    ", they concluded a possible existence of @xmath0 mesic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the near - threshold behavior of the cross section of the @xmath11 reaction supplies information on the @xmath0-nucleon interaction .",
    "the cosy-11 experiment determined the @xmath0-proton scattering length in free space , as @xmath12 .",
    "it indicates a shallow depth of the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential if one assumes no energy and density dependence  @xcite .",
    "the investigation of @xmath0 mesic nuclei will be an alternative way to extract direct information of the @xmath0-nucleus interaction .",
    "we plan a series of missing - mass spectroscopy experiments with the @xmath13 reaction  @xcite at gsi and fair . as the first step",
    ", we performed an inclusive measurement at gsi .",
    "moreover , a semi - exclusive measurement , with the coincidence of decay particles from @xmath0 mesic nuclei , will be studied in the future at fair .",
    "@xmath0-mesic nuclei will be produced by impinging a @xmath14 proton beam onto a @xmath15-thick carbon target .",
    "the incident energy is slightly above the @xmath0 production threshold in the @xmath16 reaction .",
    "the missing - mass is obtained by analyzing the momentum of the ejectile deuterons with the fragment separator ( frs ) used as a high - resolution spectrometer .",
    "the missing - mass resolution is estimated to be less than @xmath17 in @xmath18 , which is dominated by the uncertainty of the reaction vertex inside the target .",
    "it would be sufficiently smaller than the decay width of @xmath0 mesic nuclei , and this feature is one of the advantages of our experiment .",
    "figure  [ missingmass ] shows a simulated spectrum corresponding to 4.5 days of data acquisition for different @xmath0-nucleus optical potentials parameterized as @xmath19  @xcite . in the simulation",
    ", the cross section in the @xmath13 reaction is assumed to be the sum of a theoretical calculation  @xcite , in which @xmath0 production is involved , and contributions of background processes of multi - pion production , evaluated from past measurements of proton - nucleon cross sections  @xcite .",
    "the experimental sensitivity of finding peak structures above a huge background will be large enough in case of a large @xmath20 and a small @xmath21 . while the signal - to - noise ratio will be of the order of 1/100 even in such a case",
    ", a high - statistics measurement with an intense primary beam will compensate the poor signal - to - noise ratio .    the first experiment ( gsi s-437 )",
    "was carried out at gsi in august 2014 .",
    "figure  [ frs_setup ] shows the experimental setup at frs .",
    "two sets of multi - wire drift chambers ( mwdc s ) were installed close to a dispersive focal plane at s4 , and the momentum of ejectile deuterons could be analyzed by measuring their tracks with them . for particle discrimination between deuterons and protons from inelastic scattering , we measured the time - of - flight between s2 and s4 by plastic scintillators labelled with sc2h , sc2v , sc41 , and sc42 .",
    "in addition , we prepared erenkov detectors with high refractive - index ( @xmath22 ) silica aerogel radiators , which were developed at chiba university  @xcite , ( hirac and mini - hirac ) and a total - reflection erenkov detector with an acrylite radiator ( torch ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that we could make the main trigger for the @xmath13 reaction with a tight coincidence of the signals of the scintillators in s2 and s4 , and without an anticoincidence of these erenkov detectors .",
    "this removes the influence of a possible position - dependence of the overkill rate of each erenkov detector on the missing - mass spectrum .",
    "figure  [ tof2h41 ] shows the tof distribution between s2 and s4 obtained by an unbiased trigger .",
    "the two peaks are @xmath23 distant from each other , which is consistent with the tof difference between protons and deuterons within the momentum acceptance .",
    "the deuteron - to - proton ratio is found to be approximately 1/200 .",
    "later on , we could achieve a deuteron - to - proton ratio around unity by tuning the coincidence timing in order to remove the protons on the trigger level .",
    "the remaining background , which is seen beneath the deuteron peak in fig .",
    "[ tof2h41 ] , is due to sequential protons with a short ( @xmath23 ) time interval .",
    "the waveforms of the scintillator signals will serve to distinguish one - pulse events from two - pulse events .",
    "we have been working to improve the purity without losing the efficiency in particle identification .",
    "we have taken data for the following reactions with changing the frs magnetic field to cover a wide range of excitation energies between @xmath24 and @xmath25 relative to the @xmath0 emission threshold .",
    "* @xmath26 reaction at @xmath14 incident energy * @xmath27 reaction at @xmath14 incident energy ( for background study ) * @xmath28 reaction at @xmath29 incident energy ( for calibration )    the analysis of the mwdc s is in progress .",
    "for example , the overall missing - mass resolution for the @xmath26 reaction has been estimated to be @xmath30 ( preliminary ) from the missing - mass resolution of the proton peak in the calibration process .",
    "while we will proceed with an inclusive measurement with higher statistics in a future experiment , another way is to make a coincidence of the forward going deuteron with decay particles from the decay of @xmath0 mesic nuclei ( semi - exclusive measurement ) .",
    "we aim to tag a proton from the two - nucleon absorption process ( @xmath31 ) , which is one of the major decay modes of @xmath0 mesic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "this proton has a kinetic energy around @xmath32 .",
    "such a fast proton will be hardly emitted from the main background of multi - pion production processes , even if rescattering takes place , and the coincidence is expected to improve the signal - to - noise ratio significantly .",
    "more quantitative evaluation of the proton distribution from the background processes as well as the decay of @xmath0 mesic nuclei , by an intra - nuclear cascade simulation using a microscopic transport model jam  @xcite , is under way .",
    "we plan to develop a proton counter to be installed surrounding the target , by which protons can be distinguished from charged pions .",
    "this experimental setup will be possible at super - frs , which is to be built in the fair complex .",
    "we are investigating @xmath0 mesic nuclei by means of missing - mass spectroscopy with the @xmath13 reaction .",
    "an inclusive measurement of the @xmath13 reaction on @xmath33 at frs / gsi was carried out in august 2014 .",
    "the expected resolution will be around @xmath17 , which is much smaller than the width of @xmath0 mesic nuclei .",
    "the analysis is under way .",
    "furthermore , we plan to perform a semi - exclusive measurement at super - frs / fair , with tagging decay protons from the two - nucleon absorption process in @xmath0 mesic nuclei",
    ". the signal - to - noise ratio , which is of the order of 1/100 at most in the inclusive spectrum , will be improved significantly .",
    "a detailed monte carlo simulation with a microscopic transport model jam is in progress .",
    "the experiment was performed in the framework of the super - frs collaboration for fair .",
