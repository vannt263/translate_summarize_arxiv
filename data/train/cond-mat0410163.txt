    "the a@xmath1b@xmath1o@xmath2 pyrochlore family of compounds has been the object of many recent studies , principally because of the appearance of colossal magneto resistance ( cm ) in the @xmath1@xmath1@xmath2 compound .",
    "this material was reported as ferromagnetic , metallic and with enormous negative magneto resistance in the region of temperatures corresponding to the ferromagnetic transition ( tc @xmath5 121 k ) .",
    "the principal interest created for this material is that the double exchange ( de ) zener model does not explain the cm in this material .",
    "experimental studies show that , when compared with other a@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2 compounds , the tl one is unique .",
    "it has a very high tc , a property shared with the in pyrochlore , but it is the only compound of the series that presents metallic conductivity , which can not be explained by doping because it is present in the stoichiometric compound .",
    "several recent band calculations@xcite show that the material is expected to be almost half metallic at low temperatures , that is , the conductivity is driven within only one of the spin directions .",
    "this property is the same for the de perovskites , but in that case the conductivity and the ferromagnetism appear only with doping .",
    "the whole family of mn pyrochlores shows ferromagnetism,@xcite and their bands present similarities , with a band gap reducing its value from y  to tl , where the compound is slightly metallic with very different conductivity for the both spin directions .",
    "the ferromagnetism in the mn pyrochlore compounds is explained by the kanamori - goodenough rules , as the result of superexchange through the o ligands .",
    "however , the curie temperatures do not scale with the bond angles , which seems to indicate a different mechanism for the in and tl compounds@xcite(the calculated values of the exchange parameter _",
    "j _ for the tl , in , and y compounds are respectively 0.11 k , 2.52 k , and 1.1k , but their corresponding measured tc s are 124 k , 129 k and 16 k ) .    the experimental paper published by raju et al.@xcite  tries to explain the ferromagnetism of the tl compound through de , but several evidences proved afterwards that the origin of ferromagnetism is only superexchange .",
    "a small number of carriers , of the order found in doped semiconductors @xmath6 $ ] , was found in the tl compound by measuring hall effect@xcite@xmath7 _ _ several authors obtain a large enhancement of the magnetoresistance@xcite by doping the tl sites with in and sc , or the mn sites with ru .",
    "the behavior of the resistivity is sample dependent @xcite at high t , which created a controversy about the compound behavior in this region of temperatures .",
    "imai et al@xcite present the more complete set of measurements of hall effect and magneto - thermopower .",
    "_ _ they measured the anomalous hall coefficient at low ( below tc ) and high temperatures , and they found it small in both cases . following",
    "singh@xcite they assume a very simple  quasi spherical fermi surface and fit the thermopower to the effective mass model .",
    "the pressure reduces the value of tc for all the mn pyrochlores.@xcite nuez- regueiro and lacroix@xcite developed a theory for this effect that gives good agreement with the experimental results , confirming that the ferromagnetism is due to superexchange .",
    "ventura and alascio@xcite used an intermediate valence ( iv ) model for the tl , and they could explain both the conductivity and the cm of the pure tl compound .",
    "here we refine their calculations , using the same iv model , but employing hubbard x operators.@xcite we calculate both the static and dynamic conductivity and a qualitative agreement with the measured quantities was obtained@xcite , without having to assume an o deficiency .",
    "this agrees with the result of the published band studies@xcite . following schweitzer and czycholl@xcite we calculate the thermopower and magnetothermopower , and our results agree with the experiments.@xcite    in section",
    "ii we reformulate the model of ventura and alascio , employing the hubbard operators .",
    "we discuss the approximate gf that we employ in the calculation , and give the formulae to calculate the resistivity , optical conductivity and thermopower . in section",
    "iii we  discuss the parameters we shall use , and calculate the transport properties and in section iv we present our conclussions .",
    "finally , we give an appendix with the atomic states employed to calculate the gf .",
    "the model employed @xcite is a lattice of local states hybridized with a conduction band .",
    "each local state has two magnetic configurations with spin @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively , that are hybridized with the conduction electrons .",
    "the local state with @xmath11 of the @xmath10 configuration is discarded , so that we have two independent systems with spin up and spin down respectively because the hybridization conserves the spin direction .",
    "each local site @xmath12 has then two states @xmath13 with @xmath14 and two states @xmath15 with @xmath16 , and their respective energies are @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    ".    we can give assume arbitrary properties and energies for the relevant localized states of this model , and it is then convenient to describe them employing hubbard operators @xmath19 , which transform the state @xmath20 into the state @xmath21 i.e. @xmath22 .",
    "these operators do not satisfy wick s theorem , and their product rules at the same site have to be used instead : @xmath23 when the operators are at different sites we chose properties equivalent to those of the usual fermi or bose : we say that @xmath24 is of the fermi type  ( bose type ) when the number of electrons in the two states @xmath25 and @xmath26 differ by an odd ( even ) number . for @xmath27",
    "we then use @xmath28 when the two operators are of the fermi type  and @xmath29   = 0 $ ] when at least one is of the bose type  ( as usual@xcite @xmath30=ab - ba$ ] and @xmath31 ) .",
    "we write the model s hamiltonian employing : @xmath32 where we denote the hubbard operators @xmath33 with @xmath34 ( note that @xmath35 ) .",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the creation and destruction operators of a conduction electron with energies @xmath38 , wave vector @xmath39 , and spin component @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , and the hybridization constant is@xmath42 where @xmath43 is independent of @xmath39 when the mixing is purely local and @xmath44 is the number of sites .",
    "the cumulant expansion was extended by hubbard@xcite to study a quantum problem with fermions , and he derived a diagrammatic expansion involving unrestricted lattice sums of connected diagrams that satisfies a linked cluster theorem .",
    "the extension of this technique to the anderson lattice@xcite is sufficiently general to treat the model described by eq .",
    "( [ e2.3 ] ) , and is the basis of the present treatment .",
    "one has to use the grand canonical ensemble of electrons , and it is then convenient to introduce @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the chemical potential and @xmath47 is the number of electrons in the state @xmath48 , and without any restriction for the treatment we shall use @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce @xmath51 because these are the forms that consistently appear in the calculations .",
    "the last term in eq . ( [ e2.3 ] ) will be considered as the perturbation , and the exact and unperturbed averages of any operator @xmath52 shall be respectively denoted by @xmath53 and @xmath54 .      as in the anderson lattice@xcite with @xmath55 one",
    "can introduce one - particle green s functions ( gfs ) of local electrons @xmath56 as well as gfs  for the c - electrons @xmath57  and crossed  gfs of the type @xmath58 , all of them defined in the intervals @xmath59 .",
    "it is possible to associate a fourier series to these gfs because of their boundary condition in this variable,@xcite and the coefficients @xmath60 correspond to the matsubara frequencies @xmath61 ( where @xmath62 are all the positive and negative odd integer numbers ) .",
    "one can also transform the gf to reciprocal space,@xcite and because of the invariance against time and lattice translations @xmath63 transforming the eigenstates of the c - electrons to the wannier representation , one also obtains the equivalent relations for @xmath64 and @xmath65 . considering that the coefficients of the @xmath66 fourier series for each @xmath39 are the values of a function of the complex variable @xmath67 at the points @xmath68 ,",
    "it is possible to make the analytic continuation to the upper and lower half - planes of @xmath69 in the usual way,@xcite obtaining , e.g. from the @xmath70 , a function @xmath71 which is minus the fourier transform of the double time gf.@xcite    the one - electron gf of ordinary fermions or bosons can be expressed as a sum of infinite proper  ( or irreducible ) diagrams,@xcite and a similar result was obtained for the hubbard model employing the cumulant expansion@xcite with the hopping as perturbation . in the cumulant expansion of the anderson lattice@xcite we employed the hybridization rather than the hopping as a perturbation , and",
    "the exact solution of the conduction electrons problem in the absence of hybridization was included in the zeroth order hamiltonian .",
    "it was then necessary to extend metzner s derivation@xcite to the anderson lattice , and the same type of results he derived were also obtained for the anderson lattice . as with the feynmann diagrams , one can rearrange all those that contribute to the exact @xmath70 by defining an effective cumulant @xmath72 , that is given by all the diagrams of @xmath70 that can not be separated by cutting a single edge ( usually called proper  or irreducible  diagrams ) .",
    "the exact one - particle gfs of the anderson lattice@xcite  were then obtained by introducing the @xmath72 in the cumulant expansion , and the model employed in those works was sufficiently general , so that their results could be easily extended to the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ e2.3 ] ) in the present work",
    ".    by analytical continuation one then obtains the formal expressions of the exact one - particle gfs of our model:@xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the free c - electron propagator .",
    "the calculation of @xmath76 is as difficult as that of @xmath70 , and it is then convenient to use an approximation : we shall replace@xmath77 by the corresponding quantity @xmath78 of an exactly soluble hamiltonian , namely the one describing the atomic limit of the same model .",
    "although the hopping is neglected in this system , described by the hamiltonian of eqs .",
    "( [ e2.3 ] ) with @xmath79 and with a local hybridization @xmath80 , the @xmath81 implicitly contains all the higher order cumulants that appear in the exact quantity . in the case of the anderson lattice",
    ", the atomic limit contains the basic physics of the formation of the singlet ground state and of the appearance of the kondo peak,@xcite and we expect that it would provide an adequate description of the present model . because of its atomic character , the approximate effective cumulant @xmath81 thus obtained is independent of @xmath39 ,  and can be calculated exactly as discussed below .    with the approximations introduced above and employing the wannier representation for the @xmath82-electron operators",
    "the whole system becomes a collection of local systems , described by a hamiltonian @xmath83 , where @xmath84  is the local hamiltonian at site @xmath12 .",
    "this @xmath84 can be solved exactly:@xmath85 where @xmath86 is the eigenstate at site @xmath12 with energy @xmath87 , that is characterized by @xmath88 and its number @xmath62 of electrons . because of the translational invariance we shall drop the site index @xmath12 when it is not necessary , and we shall also use the quantities @xmath89 , more adequate for the @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ e2.6 ] ) than the @xmath87 ( for convenience we use @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) . in the appendix",
    "we give in table [ t1 ] the properties of the @xmath91 states : the number @xmath88 that identifies the state , the @xmath69 component of spin @xmath92 and the quantities @xmath93 .",
    "it is now straightforward to express the fourier transform @xmath94 of the f - electron gf in the atomic limit @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the grand canonical potential.@xcite the equivalent equations for the c - electrons are obtained by just replacing @xmath97 in eq .",
    "( [ e2.12 ] ) by @xmath98 .",
    "the f - electron gf can be written in the form @xmath99 and the poles @xmath100 and residues @xmath101 of @xmath102 are all real ( cf .",
    "( [ e2.12 ] ) ) .",
    "there are only eight different @xmath103 for the f - electron gf , because different transitions have the same energy and the residues of some transitions are zero , and by analytic continuation one obtains @xmath104 , but there are more transitions for the @xmath105 .",
    "the approximation employed in the present work consists in substituting @xmath106 in eq .",
    "( [ e2.8 ] ) by the approximate @xmath107 , derived from the exact @xmath104 by solving for @xmath108 in the equation that is the atomic equivalent of eq .",
    "( [ e2.8 ] ) .",
    "one then obtains @xmath109 and from the point of view of the cumulant expansion , it contains all the irreducible diagrams that contribute to the exact @xmath110 .",
    "it should be emphasized that this diagrams contain loops of any size , because there is no excluded site in this expansion , but all the local vertices correspond to the same site , although they appear as different vertices in each diagram .",
    "when a local hybridization is used ( i.e. @xmath80 ) , the only difference between the exact and approximate quantities is that different energies @xmath38 appear in the c - electron propagators of the effective cumulant @xmath110 , while these energies are all equal to @xmath111 in @xmath112 .",
    "although @xmath112 is for that reason only an approximation , it contains all the diagrams that should be present , and one would expect that the corresponding gf would have fairly realistic features .",
    "one still has to decide what value of @xmath111 should be taken .",
    "as the most important region of the conduction electrons is the fermi energy , we shall use @xmath113 , leaving the freedom of small changes @xmath114 to adjust the results to particular situations , but fixing its value for a given system when @xmath46 has to change to keep the total number of electrons @xmath115 fixed , as for example when changing the temperature @xmath116 .",
    "another important point , is that concentrating all the conduction electrons at @xmath111 would overestimate their contribution to the effective cumulant , and we shall then reduce the hybridization by a coefficient that gives the fraction of c - electrons which contribute most .",
    "we consider that this is of the order of @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the density of states of the free c electrons per site and per spin , and to be more definite we chose @xmath119 , so the effective hybridization constant @xmath120 coincides with the usual mixing strength  @xmath121 .",
    "this is essentially the same choice made by alascio et.al.@xcite in their localized description of valence fluctuations .",
    "note that @xmath120 is only used in the calculation of @xmath108 , and that the full value must be substituted in the @xmath122 that appears explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ e2.8 ] ) , because the whole band of conduction energies is used in @xmath123 .",
    "two particle gf should be used in the well known kubo formula,@xcite that relates the dynamic conductivity @xmath124 to the current current correlations . to simplify the calculations for the pam , schweitzer and czycholl@xcite employed the expression of the conductivity for dimension @xmath125 as an approximation of the static conductivity for @xmath126 .",
    "only one - particle gfs are then necessary to obtain @xmath127 in that limit , because the vertex corrections cancel out,@xcite and we shall use the same approximation . as",
    "the hybridization is a hopping of electrons between two different bands , it contributes to the current operator,@xcite but this contribution cancels out in our model because we employ a local hybridization @xmath128 .",
    "the expression obtained contains explicit sums over @xmath39 , but it is possible to make a further simplification by considering nearest - neighbor hopping in a simple cubic lattice,@xcite and the sums over @xmath129  can be transformed@xcite in integrals over the free conduction electron energy @xmath130 .",
    "this transformation is possible because in our method the @xmath131 only depends on @xmath39 through the @xmath132 , as both @xmath108 and @xmath128 are @xmath39 independent .",

    "we shall generally use a rectangular band with @xmath141 @xmath142 , and we set @xmath143 to estimate the hopping parameter @xmath144 of the hypercubic lattice , and use @xmath126 .    employing reference [ ]",
    "we obtain the expression for the thermopower @xmath145 : @xmath146      as the system consists of two independent subsystems ( spin up and spin down ) we could attribute arbitrary probabilities @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) to the spin up ( spin down ) subsystem , and calculate the corresponding properties of the system . following the work of ventura and alascio , we shall estimate the probability @xmath147 from the system magnetization , that we calculated employing the weiss molecular field approximation : @xmath149 here @xmath150 is the local magnetic moment , @xmath151 the magnetic field , @xmath152 the curie temperature and @xmath153 the saturation magnetization . following those authors we use @xmath154 , as intermediate between the @xmath155local moment of the @xmath156 and the @xmath157 corresponding to the @xmath158 .    to calculate the probability @xmath147",

    "gf it is possible to calculate @xmath160 for each value of @xmath147 and @xmath116 , and it is necessary to find the chemical potential @xmath46 that gives the required number of electrons per site .",
    "we shall consider the stoichiometric @xmath1@xmath0@xmath2 compound , and we shall then fix the total number of electrons per site as @xmath161 . to keep this value constant , it might be necessary to change the chemical potential @xmath46 with the temperature @xmath116 , and we shall employ the approximate gf @xmath104 and @xmath162 to calculate the number @xmath160 at each @xmath116 and then solve numerically the equation @xmath161 .",
    "we shall use a rectangular band centered at the energy origin and with a half width @xmath163 ev , and take the energies for the spin @xmath164 and @xmath165 in the presence of the field @xmath151 as @xmath18 = @xmath166 and @xmath17 = @xmath167 , with @xmath168 ev , so that the spin @xmath164 has the lowest energy of the local states at @xmath169 .",
    "it seems clear that the basic scattering mechanism in our calculation of @xmath170 is the hybridization , because the otherwise free conduction electrons are scattered by the localized f electrons through this interaction .",
    "this is apparent if we notice that the relaxation effects are described by the imaginary part of the usual self - energy @xmath171 , defined through @xmath172 and that the exact relation @xmath173 follows from eq .",
    "( [ e2.8b ] ) .",
    "the relaxation mechanism of the c - electrons is then provided by the hybridization , and in our approximation the self energy @xmath174 is independent of @xmath39 .",
    "it seems then clear that the resistivity at low temperatures depends sensitively on the value of @xmath122 .",
    "this quantity also determines the position of the peak of the dynamic conductivity that is close to @xmath175 e.v at @xmath176 k , and to try and adjust the two different properties we have employed a temperature dependent hybridization @xmath122 , using values that decrease from @xmath177 ev to @xmath178 ev as @xmath116 increases to @xmath179 k.    we have also employed a value of @xmath180 that changes from @xmath181 ev to @xmath182 ev in the same temperature range , because it gives a better overall agreement with the experimental results .    to alleviate somehow the use of a zeroth width conduction band in the calculation of the effective cumulant we have added an extra imaginary part @xmath183 @xmath184 ev to the complex variable @xmath69 .",
    "addition of @xmath183 to the argument of @xmath108 leads to similar effects as those already obtained by mutou and hirashima@xcite through introducing a small imaginary part @xmath185 to the conduction electrons , i.e. replacing @xmath186 by @xmath187 in the gfs @xmath71 and @xmath188 .",
    "their justification is the existence in real systems of scattering processes due to phonons and impurities , and we should also consider this mechanisms as contributing to the @xmath189 . within this interpretation",
    "one could also consider a temperature dependence of @xmath183 , but we have not implemented this change in the present calculation .      a very useful quantity is the local spectral density of the conduction electrons , namely @xmath190 because it illuminates the dependence with @xmath116 of the static conductivity . in figure [ fg01 ]",

    "asuming that the system is stoichiometric we have calculated the resistivity , optical conductivity and thermopower as a function of temperature and magnetic field of the model of @xmath1@xmath1@xmath2 introduced by ventura and alascio.@xcite differently from other studies , we have calculated these transport properties employing kubo s formula , that is directly related to the electronic gfs . to derive these gfs we introduced hubbard operators to describe the model , and used a treatment previously employed to study with the dependence of resistivity and thermopower with magnetic field we have also calculated the magneto resistance and the magneto thermopower .",
    "we obtain a semiquantitative agreement with the experimental results by an adequate choice of the system parameters , and we can conclude that the model gives a fair description of all the calculated properties .",
