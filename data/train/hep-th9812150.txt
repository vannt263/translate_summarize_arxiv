    "the complex angular momentum analysis was widely used in the sixties , in particle physics , for describing the high - energy asymptotic behaviour of the scattering amplitude . with the arrival of qcd much attention",
    "was diverted away from the `` old - fashioned '' approach to the strong interactions .",
    "interest was reignited ( see [ 1 ] and references therein ) within the particle physics community with the arrival of colliders capable of delivering very large centre - of - mass energies ( e.g. the hera collider at desy and the tevatron collider at fnal ) ; from the theoretical viewpoint , this revival was made possible by the much earlier important results of bfkl[2 ] who discovered and characterized the regge - like asymptotic properties of appropriate resummations of perturbative amplitudes for similar results in the case of scalar fields ] in qcd .    in the deep inelastic lepton - proton scattering a central role is played by the so - called `` structure - functions '' which parametrize the structure of the target as `` seen '' by the virtual photon .",
    "they are usually denoted by @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the momentum transfer @xmath10 and @xmath11 being respectively the incoming and outgoing lepton four - momenta ) , while @xmath12 it is now possible to explore the structure functions in a region where the momentum transfer is much smaller than the centre- of - mass energy , i.e. for small values of @xmath13  in the parton model one can show that the @xmath14-dependence , in the limit @xmath15 is related to the behaviour of hadronic scattering cross - sections at high energy [ 4 ] .",
    "this behaviour , which appears to exhibit regge - like asymptotic properties , is reminiscent of the concept of `` exchange of families of particles with different spins '' . a detailed analysis of small @xmath14 structure function measurements , at fixed target energies [ 5 ] ,",
    "show that they are indeed approximately consistent with the predictions of such a model .",
    "we can thus say that , on one side , the phenomenology calls for an extension of the conventional exchange process and suggests an exchange mechanism involving families of particles ; on the other side , from a theoretical viewpoint , these families could be described by `` moving poles '' , namely , poles in a certain `` complex angular momentum plane '' .    the complex angular momentum theory originated long ago in connection with some problems of classical mathematical physics , mainly",
    "the diffraction [ 6 ] .",
    "then regge [ 7 ] extended these methods to quantum mechanics and specifically to the scattering by yukawian potentials ( see also [ 8 ] ) . in these works ,",
    "the complex angular momentum analysis was produced by a direct analytic interpolation to complex values of the angular momentum variable of the relevant differential equations for partial waves .",
    "then several authors ( see [ 9 ] and references therein ) conjectured that the results proved by regge , at non - relativistic level , might as well be applied to the high energy relativistic dynamics where the method could really display all its power .",
    "this relativistic extension , which of course could no more be justified in a simple framework of differential equations , was given a tentative formulation [ 9 ] in the approach of the so - called `` @xmath16-matrix theory '' based on the general , but rather loose concept of `` maximal analyticity '' .",
    "however , it must be emphasized that since that time no genuine relativistic complex angular momentum theory relying on the general principles of quantum field theory ( q.f.t . ) has been given at all .    in view of the considerations developed above",
    ", one is then led to set the following question whose conceptual interest is of primary importance :    is it possible to find in the framework of general q.f.t .",
    "a mathematical structure which leads to poles moving in the complex angular momentum plane and that are responsible for an exchange mechanism involving families of particles and giving rise to regge - like asymptotic properties , as suggested by the analyses of bfkl[2 ] and bergre et al.[3 ] in the philosophy of resummations of perturbative qft ?    we have already announced and briefly sketched a positive answer to this question in a previous work [ 10 ] . here we shall provide a detailed proof of the first basic result of [ 10 ] , namely the existence of a field - theoretical off - shell version of the froissart - gribov representation of the partial - waves [ 11,12 ] ; the latter had been discovered by these authors in 1961 in the analytic @xmath16-matrix approach of particle physics , requiring that the scattering amplitude should satisfy the mandelstam representation .",
    "in order to prove our field - theoretical result we make use of a basic analyticity property of the four - point function @xmath17 implied by the standard axioms of locality , spectrum and lorentz invariance ; moreover we use a majorization of @xmath18 which is a consequence of the `` temperateness axiom '' of quantum field theory . the result which can be derived from these properties",
    "is the following : for each given two - field channel called the @xmath0channel , with total squared energy - momentum @xmath19 and ( off - shell ) scattering angle @xmath1 , there exists an appropriate fourier ",
    "laplace type transform of @xmath18 with certain analyticity properties in the complex angular momentum @xmath2 which is the natural conjugate variable of @xmath1 .",
    "one thus obtains a generalization of the relationship which exists in the standard laplace transform theory between analyticity properties ( including possible poles ) of the transform and the asymptotic behaviour of the original function .  from our viewpoint",
    "this laplace - type transform can be regarded as the mathematical structure which relates the complex angular momentum poles ( moving poles ) to the high - energy asymptotic behaviour.moreover this approach presents further advantages :    \\i ) the analysis is completely worked out in the complex momentum space scenario appropriate to q.f.t.[13 ] ( see , on this point , our comment below ) .",
    "\\ii ) it is the joint exploitation of harmonic analysis on orbital manifolds of the lorentz group together with basic analyticity properties of q.f.t .",
    "which entails the complex angular momentum structure ; this method holds in any space - time dimension @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "\\iii ) by the use of our fourier - laplace - type transformation one can perform a partial diagonalization ( namely a diagonalization with respect to the angular variables ) of the convolution product involved in the bethe ",
    "salpeter integral equations",
    ". this rigorous mathematical structure , which pertains to the general framework of q.f.t .",
    ", is thereby directly responsible for the existence of poles in the complex angular momentum variable .",
    "this is the content of our second basic result presented in [ 10 ] , whose detailed proof will be given elsewhere[14 ] .",
    "one can specify the advantage mentioned in i ) under two respects :    _ a ) with respect to the s - matrix approach . _",
    "the absorptive parts of @xmath18 in the crossed two - field channels have their supports inside regions of appropriate one - sheeted hyperboloids determined by the future cone ordering relation ( in view of the spectral conditions ) .",
    "this geometrical property can be properly specified in terms of energy - momentum configurations , which are of more controllable interpretation than the sets of lorentz invariants , as they were used in the mandelstam representation . as a matter of fact , the mandelstam double spectral region ( used in [ 11,12 ] ) corresponds to complex energy - momentum configurations which have no simple physical interpretation .",
    "_ b ) with respect to the approach of euclidean q.f.t .. _ the fact that the `` euclidean partial - waves '' admit an analytic interpolation in the complex angular momentum variables is explicitly shown to be equivalent to the property of analytic continuation of the four - point function from euclidean momentum - space to minkowskian momentum - space ( through a domain which is permitted by the requirements of locality and spectral conditions ) .",
    "we now wish to stress that the conceptual interest of the present study can be envisaged from two viewpoints , according to whether the fundamental fields considered are those of the qcd - theory or the `` elementary meson and baryon fields '' used at the age of dispersion theory . in the latter case , which is the traditional case of application of the axioms of q.f.t .",
    ", our results appear as `` off - shell results '' ; but in order to get rid of this restriction , one can use the analytic continuation technique adopted in the proof of dispersion relations ( see [ 15 ] and references therein ) and/or positivity constraints ( analogous to those used by martin[16 ] ) to reach the mass - shell values and possibly a positive interval in the energy variable @xmath19 , so that a range of possible bound - states might be included in our analysis .",
    "we now conjecture that our results might be applicable with even more interest to the former case , in which the phenomenon of confinement is present , so that the off - shell character of our study not only remains relevant but is even the only one to be relevant !  in fact , it seems admitted that the general principles used here ( locality , spectrum , lorentz covariance , temperateness ) still apply to theories of qcd - type in suitable gauges : our results on complex angular momentum analysis then follow without requiring the existence of asymptotic elementary particles of the fields and are fully consistent with confinement .",
    "moreover , the possible production of _ a discrete spectrum of composite particles ( namely hadrons and possibly `` glueballs '' ) appearing as `` regge - type particles '' _ via appropriate bethe - salpeter - type equations is built - in [ 10,14 ] in this general field - theoretical framework . in the present study",
    ", we only considered ( for simplicity ) the case of scalar fields ; but one can expect that the joint exploitation of harmonic analysis on lorentz orbital manifolds together with axiomatic analyticity still yields similar results for more general fields in lorentz covariant gauges .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sec.2 is devoted to an appropriate analysis of the complex geometry associated with a given two field @xmath0channel .  in sec.3",
    "we derive axiomatic analyticity properties and bounds of the four - point functions with respect to the ( off - shell ) scattering angle @xmath1 in manifolds bordered by the @xmath20cut and @xmath21cut of the crossed channels .",
    "it is then shown in sec.4 that these properties of the four - point function are equivalent to the existence of a laplace - type transform of the latter with respect to the corresponding complex angular momentum variable @xmath2 .",
    "this transform , which is explicitly defined in terms of the ( off - shell ) absorptive parts of the crossed @xmath20 and @xmath21channels , is studied in arbitrary space - time dimension @xmath22 : analyticity and bounds in a half - plane @xmath23 and the property of carlsonian interpolation of the euclidean partial - waves satisfied by this laplace - type transform ( froissart - gribov - type equalities ) are established .",
    "the inverse of the transformation is also described and , as a by - product , the connection ( mentioned above ) between the analytic continuation from euclidean to minkowskian space and the analytic interpolation in the complex angular momentum plane is displayed . in appendix",
    "a , we give mathematical tools used for the analytic completion of sec.3 .",
