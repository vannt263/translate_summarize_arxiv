    "we propose a seesaw model built upon the hypercharge zero fermionic weak quintuplet which , in isolation , provides a viable dark matter ( dm ) particle within the so - called minimal dark matter ( mdm ) model @xcite .",
    "we explore the conditions under which the quintuplets @xmath10 could simultaneously generate the masses of the known neutrinos and provide a stable dm candidate .",
    "the proposed model goes beyond the three tree - level realizations of weinberg s effective dimension - five operator @xmath11 @xcite : type i @xcite , type ii @xcite , and type iii @xcite seesaw mechanisms , mediated by a heavy fermion singlet , a scalar triplet , and a fermion triplet , respectively .",
    "a seesaw mediator of isospin larger than one has to be accompanied by a scalar multiplet larger than that of the standard model ( sm ) higgs doublet .",
    "our previous model @xcite based on an exotic nonzero hypercharge weak quintuplet dirac fermion @xmath12 generates the neutrino masses both at the tree level and at the loop level . at the tree level it corresponds to dimension - nine seesaw operator which reproduces the empirical neutrino masses @xmath2 ev with @xmath13 few 100 gev states testable at the lhc , while for heavier masses , which are outside of the lhc reach , these exotic leptons generate radiative neutrino masses",
    ". however , if one expects from new states to accomplish simultaneously the dm mission , they should have zero hypercharge .    a recent `` r@xmath14mdm model '' @xcite of purely radiative neutrino ( @xmath15 ) masses employs hypercharge zero quintuplets @xmath10 which , taken in isolation , provide a viable mdm candidate @xcite . in a separate paper @xcite",
    "we identify an omitted term in @xcite which spoils the claimed dm stability .",
    "therefore , we adopt here a more general approach in which we analyze in detail both the tree - level and the radiative neutrino masses generated by hypercharge zero quintuplets @xmath10 .",
    "thereby we address also the phenomenology of these states at the lhc and recall that by imposing a @xmath9 symmetry , one can reconcile the seesaw mission with the viability as a dm .",
    "as announced above , the model we propose here is based on the symmetry of the sm gauge group @xmath16 .",
    "in addition to usual sm fermions , we introduce three generations of hypercharge zero quintuplets @xmath17 , transforming as @xmath18 under the gauge group .",
    "also , in addition to the sm higgs doublet @xmath19 there is a scalar quadruplet @xmath20 transforming as @xmath21 .",
    "this is in contrast to a recent model for radiative neutrino masses @xcite adopted subsequently in @xcite , where a use of the scalar sextuplet @xmath22 avoids the tree - level contribution . in a tensor notation suitable to cope with higher @xmath23 multiplets @xcite our additional fields are totally symmetric tensors @xmath24 and @xmath25 with the following components : @xmath26 @xmath27 the gauge invariant and renormalizable lagrangian involving these new fields reads @xmath28 here , @xmath29 is the gauge covariant derivative , @xmath30 is the yukawa - coupling matrix and @xmath31 is the mass matrix of the heavy leptons , which we choose to be real and diagonal .",

    "the fermionic quintuplet of this paper was selected previously as a viable mdm candidate in @xcite . to employ it as a seesaw mediator requires additional scalar multiplets , what makes the neutral component of the quintuplet unstable .",

    "the new states could be within reach of the lhc . to ensure a large enough mass splitting",
    ", the coupling @xmath59 can not be too small .",
    "accordingly , from eq .",
    "( [ loop ] ) , it follows that the yukawa couplings have to be smaller , suppressing the lfv effects .",
    "in this account we propose a tev - scale model for neutrino masses based only on the gauge symmetry and the renormalizability of the sm .",
    "the model employs fermion quintuplets with zero hypercharge , which in isolation correspond to cosmological minimal dark matter candidate .",
    "such tev - scale fermions in conjunction with the scalar quadruplet can generate neutrino masses both by the tree - level contributions in fig .",
    "[ dim9op ] and the loop level contributions in fig .",

    "the decays of these states to sm charged leptons have an interesting multilepton signature .",
    "there are , in addition , same - sign dilepton events displayed in table 2 .",
    "these events have a negligible sm background , as demonstrated @xcite in generic new physics scenario with lepton number violation .",
    "in particular , the detailed studies of fermionic triplets from type iii seesaw scenario @xcite apply to our case of fermionic quintuplets .",
    "the multilepton events listed in our table 2 are in direct correspondence with the items from type iii seesaw given in table 13 of ref .",
    "@xcite , to which also the analysis in @xcite refers . the signals which are good for the discovery correspond to a relatively high signal rate and small sm background , which is calculated by madgraph @xcite .",
    "in order to compare the signal and sm background cross sections , we assume a particular choice of parameters leading to the branching ratios given in table 2 , restricted to @xmath111 leptons in the final states . in this respect we distinguish four classes of events containing @xmath112 decaying to @xmath113 or @xmath114 lepton and @xmath115 resonance to help in @xmath112 identification : @xmath116 which has too small of a cross section ( 0.03 fb with respect to the sm background of 0.6 fb ) at 7 tev lhc ; @xmath117 which has a cross section of 0.7 fb , comparable to the sm background of 0.8 fb ; @xmath118 the lnv event having 0.7 fb with the same - sign dilepton state , which is nonexistent in the sm and thus devoid of the sm background ; @xmath119 having a relatively high signal rate ( 1.1 fb with respect to sm background of 0.8 fb ) . the classes @xmath120 and @xmath121 lead to signals elaborately detailed in @xcite , which can be rescaled to infer on the lhc discovery reach",
    "the model of neutrino mass generation presented here represents a generalization of the fermion triplet seesaw mediator from the type iii seesaw model to a hypercharge zero quintuplet , which we postponed at the time of elaborating first its nonzero - hypercharge variant in @xcite .",
    "the hypercharge zero quintuplet has been proposed subsequently in @xcite .",
    "one can question the possibility to distinguish between the present hypercharge zero quintuplet with a doubly - charged component and previously considered nonzero hypercharge states @xcite , which provide spectacular falsifiable triply - charged signatures .",
    "consequently , a nonobservation of the latter would put in a forefront the hypercharge zero quintuplets , which provide their neutral components as potential mdm candidates .",
    "however , a blow to the stability of such dm comes from the presence of additional fields needed to generate the described small neutrino masses . as usual ,",
    "the stability can be restored by introducing the discrete symmetry under which the new states are odd , in which case neutrinos get mass only from radiative contributions .",
