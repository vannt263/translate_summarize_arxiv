    "master source catalogs based on all robust @xmath15 detections to @xmath43 mag and @xmath20 mag in the hudf09 and ers imaging , respectively , were constructed as follows .",
    "first , ` sextractor ` ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) was run on each of the reduced @xmath15 science images with four different choices of deblend parameters representing _ hot _ ( ` nthresh ` @xmath44 64 ) , _ medium _ ( ` nthresh ` @xmath44 16 ) ,",
    "_ cold _ ( ` nthresh ` @xmath44 8) , and _ very cold _ ( ` nthresh ` @xmath44 2 ) extractions . in each case , the rms frames output from ` multidrizzle ` were scaled to reflect the true signal - to - noise of the reduced science images before their application as weight maps , and the following key control parameters were adopted : ` detect_thresh ` @xmath44 @xmath45 , ` detect_minarea ` @xmath44 12 , and ` min_cont ` @xmath44 0.0001 .",
    "based on these @xmath15 extractions we then re - ran ` sextractor ` in dual image mode to recover aperture - matched fluxes and kron magnitudes from the remaining optical - to - nir hst images ( @xmath28 to @xmath26 ) .",
    "careful visual inspection of the output kron ellipses of sources identified in each extraction was then performed to remove spurious detections , and to identify the most appropriate aperture for flux measurement of each real source . when choosing the best aperture we considered both the positions of possible matches in the goods - music catalog and the appearance of each source in all seven acs plus wfc3 ( @xmath28 through @xmath15 ) filters .",
    "in ambiguous cases we favoured the deblending of objects into distinct concentrations of @xmath15 flux ( the filter expected to best trace the underlying stellar mass distribution , modulo some uncertainty regarding the role of tp - agb stars ) . for calibration of the nir magnitudes we employed the latest ( ab system ) wfc3/ir zero - points available from the stsci webpage , and for the optical magnitudes we adopted the acs zero - points determined by the goods team .",
    "a total of 1052 and 3078 sources were thereby recovered to @xmath46 mag and @xmath20 mag in the hudf09 and ers imaging , respectively . to define the master source catalogs employed in this analysis",
    "we limit our samples to those systems with high s / n coverage in all 7 available acs plus wfc3 filters and lying within the region of sky covered by the goods - music catalog , a total of 993 and 2630 objects in the hudf09 and ers , respectively .    for all objects in our master source catalogs we searched for counterparts in the goods - music catalog ( santini et al .",
    "2009 ) with matching positions and photometric apertures .",
    "all object pairs with centroid differences of @xmath470.24 arcsec ( i.e. , 4 pixels in our drizzled wfc3 images ) and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 magnitudes differing by less than 0.5 mag between the two catalogs were classified automatically as successfully matched426 sources in the hudf09 and 1954 in the ers fields .",
    "the remaining object pairs not satisfying these criteria were visually inspected , and a further 44 and 294 matches were thereby recovered for the hudf09 and ers fields , respectively .    for most galaxies at @xmath48 mag no counterpart could be identified due to the brighter goods - music selection limits ( @xmath49 mag or @xmath50 mag ) . in total , 523 and 382 objects in our master source catalogs from the hudf09 and ers , respectively , were ultimately deemed to be missing valid counterparts in the goods - music catalog .      star - galaxy separation in our hudf09 and ers samples was performed as follows .",
    "first , all sources matched to counterparts in the goods - music catalog with spectroscopic redshift quality flag @xmath472 and @xmath51 ( 2 objects in the hudf09 , and 29 in the ers ) and all objects with centroids matched within @xmath52 arcsec to members of the pears - s star catalog of pirzkal et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ( an additional 3 and 16 sources in the hudf09 and ers , respectively ) were identified as spectroscopically - confirmed stars .",
    "in addition , all ultra - compact outliers from the observed @xmath15 apparent magnitude@xmath53kron radius distributions at @xmath54 ( with @xmath55 0.2 for the hudf09 and 0.075 for the ers ) not already identified as spectroscopically - confirmed stars were visually - inspected and classified as candidate stars ( 2 in the hudf09 , and 35 in the ers ) unless resolved structure was clearly evident .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows these candidate stars on the @xmath15 apparent magnitude@xmath53kron radius diagnostic diagram .",
    "we exclude these sources from our analysis of galaxy color - selection efficiencies in section [ results ] .",
    "we have computed photometric redshifts for all objects in our hudf09 and ers source catalogs via template fitting to the observed spectral energy distributions in the hst acs and wfc3 filters ( @xmath28 to @xmath15 ) , supplemented by the additional photometry in the goods - music catalog ( for a total of 15 passbands ) where a valid counterpart could be identified .",
    "the actual template fitting was performed using the _ zurich extragalactic bayesian redshift analyzer _ ( zebra ; feldmann et al.2006 ) . to recover optimal photometric redshifts",
    "zebra modifies an empirical template library ( polletta et al .  2007 ; plus model seds for very blue objects from bruzual & charlot 2003 ) to account for systematic mismatches against the observed spectral energy distributions .",
    "we quantify empirically our mean photometric redshift uncertainties by comparison against matched objects with confident ( quality flag @xmath472 ) spectroscopic redshifts in the goods - music , daddi et al .",
    ", cimatti et al . , and roche et al .  catalogs ( 86 in the hudf09 , and 446 in the ers ) , as illustrated in the panels in the left most columns of fig .",
    "we thereby estimate typical uncertainties ( @xmath56 ) of @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the hudf09 and ers master source catalogs , respectively .",
    "the larger uncertainties in the hudf09 photometric redshifts reflect the relatively small number of confident spectroscopic measurements available in this field for calibration of our sed template library .",
    "we also note low rates of catastrophic failures for the zebra photometric redshift pipeline , namely that @xmath475% of galaxies in the hudf09 , and @xmath479% of galaxies in the ers , are in disagreement with their spectroscopic redshifts by @xmath59 .    at @xmath60 ,",
    "where the greatest numbers of spectroscopic redshifts are available ( 78 in the hudf09 , and 355 in the ers ) , the mean uncertainties are reduced to @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , at @xmath63 our photometric redshift accuracy remains satisfactory with uncertainties of only @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , respectively ",
    "although we note that in the case of the hudf09 the reliability of this comparison is limited by the small number ( 8) of spectroscopic redshifts in this interval .",
    "hence , as a further stage of quality control on our zebra photometric redshifts we also evaluate here the performance of the output confidence intervals derived from the posterior probability distribution in redshift space for each galaxy .",
    "specifically , we examine the ratio between @xmath66 ( i.e. , the absolute difference between the maximum likelihood photometric redshift and the true spectroscopic redshift ) and the width of the one sigma confidence interval for each galaxy ( cf .",
    "ilbert et al .",
    "if our posterior probability distributions are well estimated then we would expect the value of this quotient to be less than one for roughly 68% of each sample .",
    "in fact , our investigation reveals a slight underestimation of uncertainties by zebra such that a rescaling of these confidence interval widths by 1.25 and 1.35 for the hudf09 and ers samples , respectively , is required in order to achieve the 68% target .",
    "having calibrated our photometric redshift uncertainties we fold these via monte carlo simulation into our subsequent error calculations for the selection efficiencies of the color - color criteria presented in section [ results ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we summarize graphically the key properties of our hudf09 and ers galaxy redshift catalogs .",
    "in order from the lefthand side of the page the four columns of this figure each contain two panels demonstrating for the hudf09 and ers ( top and bottom rows , respectively ) : ( i ) the close agreement between our photometric redshift estimates and the benchmark spectroscopic values where available in each sample ; ( ii ) the necessity of our ( slight ) re - scaling of the ( zebra ) estimated uncertainties to ensure consistency in the cumulative distribution functions for ( absolute ) empirical redshift error divided by one sigma confidence interval width , i.e. , @xmath67/(1@xmath68 error ) ; ( iii ) relative frequency histograms contrasting the redshift distributions of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts against those for galaxies without ( further subdivided according to presence / absence of additional goods - music photometry)the latter distinction thereby highlighting the unique power of wfc3/ir imaging for exploring the @xmath69 discovery space ; and ( iv ) the overall redshift distributions for all galaxies in our magnitude limited samples  both of which peak around @xmath70 , as is typical for untargeted , deep imaging surveys with optical / near - ir selection ( e.g.  rudnick et al .",
    "2001 ; ilbert et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "finally , we note that our hudf09 @xmath19 mag master source catalog contains both @xmath13 candidates at this brightness from oesch et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ( udfz-42566566 and udfz-38807073 ) plus the probable supernova ( udfz-34537360 ) , all of which were assigned photometric redshifts @xmath71 by zebra .",
    "however , the remainder of the recently reported @xmath13 and @xmath72 candidates in the hudf09 and ers fields ( bouwens et al .",
    "2010a , b ; oesch et al .  2010 ; wilkins et al .",
    "2010 ) are fainter than the apparent magnitude limits employed in this study .      specific star formation rates ( ssfrs ) and stellar masses for all galaxies in our hudf09 and ers samples were estimated using an updated version of zebra , zebra+ ( oesch et al .",
    "2010 , in prep . ) .",
    "zebra+ computes various galaxy physical properties based on template fitting to model seds with the ( previously - computed ) photometric redshift , or measured spectroscopic redshift , held fixed .",
    "for this analysis we employed a library of sed templates based on the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) stellar population synthesis code with a chabrier imf ( chabrier 2003 ) , drawn from a grid of exponential decay star formation rate models well - sampled over a wide range of ages ( 0.01@xmath5312 gyr ) , decay rates ( @xmath73 @xmath44 0.05@xmath539 gyr ) , and metallicities ( 0.05@xmath532 @xmath74 ) .",
    "the impact of dust reddening is accounted for during template fitting via a calzetti extinction law ( calzetti 2001 ) with the e@xmath75 value a free parameter ( see sargent et al .",
    "2010 for a demonstration of the impact of dust reddening on galaxies at intermediate redshift ) .",
    "of course , there is a substantial degree of degeneracy in the choice of stellar population template and dust extinction model inherent in the fitting of broad - band seds , which is expected from previous studies to dominate the error budget ( contributing @xmath76 dex ) in samples for which broad - band flux measurements are available in a significant number of filters adequately sampling each galaxy sed ( e.g.  bolzonella et al .",
    "2010 ; taylor et al .",
    "thus , for galaxies in our sample matched to counterparts in the goods - music survey we expect to achieve roughly this level of accuracy , although for galaxies with hst - only photometry our uncertainties will be necessarily higher .",
    "details for zebra+ , including a further investigation into the relevant uncertainties , are given in oesch et al .",

    "two selection limits are indicated on each plot : ( i ) the sed-_dependent _ completeness limit corresponding to the lower bound on luminosity / mass of the faintest / least massive systems detectable at a given redshift above our @xmath15 magnitude threshold  all members of our hudf09 and ers samples thus lie above , or on , this line ; and ( ii ) the sed-_independent _ completeness limit corresponding to the respective lower bound under the constraint of full detectability for galaxies of _ all _ spectral types .",

    "interestingly , many galaxies at @xmath63 exhibit genuinely disturbed / interacting morphologies , i.e. , not only the young stellar populations visible in uv light , but , rather , most of the stellar mass in these galaxies , is arranged in an irregular manner . with the significantly higher angular resolution and uniformly high imaging sensitivity of wfc3/ir , the new hudf09 and ers @xmath15 images offer the most detailed view to - date of the high - redshift galaxy population at rest - frame optical wavelengths . through visual classification of the galaxies in our @xmath9 color - selected hudf09 and ers samples ,",
    "we thus investigate here , qualitatively , the diversity of galaxy structure as revealed by the wfc3/ir @xmath15 ( rest - frame optical ) images relative to the acs @xmath31 ( rest - frame uv ) images .    the first indication of the paramount importance of the rest - frame wfc3 images in understanding the @xmath0 galaxy population comes from the comparison with the goods - music catalog discussed in section [ catalog ] . in most cases where no counterpart to one of our @xmath15 sources was found in the goods - music catalog , the centroid offset that prevented automatic catalog matching was due to morphological differences between the rest - frame uv @xmath31 image ( used as a basis for most goods - music detections ) and the new rest - frame optical @xmath15 image provided by the wfc3 . in a number of instances ,",
    "the greater sensitivity of the wfc3 @xmath15 image to the smoother , underlying stellar mass distribution provided a confident aperture definition and centroid conflicting significantly with that adopted in the goods - music analysis , and no match was possible .",
    "it is evident that the rest - frame uv images on which the goods - music catalog was based often identify , as the galaxy center , a knot of star formation substantially displaced from the true galaxy center .",
    "this is , on the other hand , well identified in the rest - frame optical wfc3 images .    also , the combination of passive - sed color - selection ( _ passive yhvz _ ) and rest - frame optical morphologies ( see section [ pyhvz ] ) reveals that passive galaxies at such early epochs are indeed mostly spheroids , as shown in previous studies ( e.g.  van dokkum et al .",
    "2004 , 2010 ; daddi et al .  2005 ; trujillo et al .  2006 ; cimatti et al .  2008 ; franx et al .  2008 ) , but , in addition , a substantial fraction ( @xmath215 - 20% ) show disk morphologies .",
    "we speculate that this population of ` quenched ' disks at such early epochs might be a smoking gun for disk galaxies which have been cut out of their feeding streams of cold gas , as seen in numerical simulations and expected on theoretical grounds ( e.g.  kere et al .",
    "2005 ; dekel et al .",
    "mergers of such disks would be ` dry ' while nonetheless involving galaxies with a dynamically - cold disk component",
    ". foreseen large @xmath15-band surveys with the hst will be instrumental in understanding what fraction of dry mergers at @xmath38 - 3 involve disk galaxies  an important constraint for galaxy evolution models .",
    "furthermore , by comparison of the acs and wfc3 morphologies of all galaxies in our master source catalogs within the @xmath0 redshift window we identify four main galaxy sub - types . the first category ( class 1 ) are galaxies which , in the @xmath15-band wfc3 images , reveal a regular disk morphology ( with or without a bulge)in contrast with their irregular rest - frame uv morphologies .",
    "these class 1 galaxies are the only ones which show a morphological difference between their rest - frame uv and rest - frame optical images .",
    "the remaining three classes do separate galaxies with very different morphologies , but , strikingly , these morphologies are unchanged in rest - frame uv and rest - frame optical light .",
    "these classes are , respectively : galaxies which , both in the rest - frame uv and rest - frame optical nir wfc3 images maintain a regular , spheroid - like morphology ( class 2 ) ; galaxies which retain , in the nir wfc3 images , a highly irregular / disturbed morphology , similar to that observed in the acs rest - frame uv images ( class 3 ) ; and , finally , the population of small - sized , smooth and rather symmetric ` blobs ' of light in both the @xmath15 and @xmath31 images for which it is unclear whether these systems are proto - disks or spheroids ( class 4 ) .",
    "examples of each class are given in figures [ fig8 ] , [ fig9 ] , [ fig10 ] , and [ fig11 ] .    in class 1",
    "objects , the rest - frame optical morphology is substantially smoother , i.e. , less clumpy , and also more centrally concentrated , than in the rest - frame uv .",
    "indeed , in such systems , the wfc3 @xmath15 images expose a well - defined center  in contrast with the clumpy / asymmetric appearance of these galaxies in the rest - frame uv light .",
    "two such galaxies in our sample ( udf0093 , ers2047 ) exhibit clear bulge - dominated morphologies , and a number of others ( e.g.  udf0590 , ers3032 ) indicate the presence of small , central , disk light excesses , most likely small(er ) bulges , consistent with counterparts identified by papovich et al .",

    "systems in our color - color selection criteria ( section [ pyhvz ] ) , we stress that a non - negligible fraction of them have instead star - forming seds , indicating that such smooth , compact morphologies , while more typical of the passively - evolving galaxy population at these redshifts , can also , to a smaller extent , be achieved by galaxies that are still actively forming stars at those epochs ( e.g.  ers0556 , ers1202 ) .    class 3 objects exhibit a wide variety of morphologies , from systems with a compact nucleus plus a highly asymmetric disk - like structure ( e.g.  udf0124 ) to systems with multiple bright nuclei ( e.g.  udf0435 , ers2010 , ers1203 ) .",
    "interestingly , the disk - like structures in these systems are often warped ( e.g.  udf0124 , udf0870 ) , a phenomenon that is observed to occur in high - resolution , hydrodynamical numerical simulations in cdm cosmology , as disk galaxies stream down the hot gas filaments of the cosmic web ( steger et al 2010 , in prep . ) . in a number of cases ( e.g.  udf0435 , udf0870 )",

    "i.e . , ` clumpy'star formation activity , and thus history , in these systems .",
    "since these systems will most likely evolve into relatively massive galaxies by redshift zero , a substantial stellar population mixing , through mergers or internal dynamical instabilities , must occur over cosmic time to achieve the massive galaxy population with rather smooth stellar population gradients that we observe today .",
    "one class 3 irregular galaxy in our sample , a lop - sided disk ( udf0870 ) at @xmath98 , might exhibit a large - scale bar . while a decline in the bar fraction with increasing redshift has been demonstrated by several studies out to redshifts of @xmath99 ( e.g.  abraham et al .",

    "; cameron et al .  2010 ) , it is only with the newly available rest - frame optical , deep and high - resolution images of high-@xmath100 galaxies that a firm statement on the bar fraction at @xmath101 will become feasible .",
    "the discovery of one such system in the hudf09 images indicates that large - scale , coherent dynamical instabilities such as bars can and do exist at such early epochs ( see also the @xmath102 ` bar - like structures ' classified in the rest - frame uv by ravindranath et al .",
    "2006 ) , although they may be not as frequent as at redshift @xmath70 , given that disks at such early times appear to be , on average , substantially hotter and more turbulent than at later times ( e.g.  genzel et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "class 4 objects are relatively small - sized systems exhibiting smooth , symmetric morphologies , but with less centrally - concentrated light distributions than the class 2 objects . as such , these class 4 objects could either be diffuse counterparts of the class 2 spheroids , or else small proto - disks in the earliest stages of growth",
    ". future studies of the quantitative structural parameters and , ideally , kinematical properties of this object class are required to establish the place of these systems within the cosmic history of galaxy structural assembly .    in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] we present the morphological mix of these galaxy types in each of the @xmath21.2 gyr intervals , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , based upon counts in mass - limited samples of 30 galaxies at @xmath82@xmath4 in the hudf09 and 30 galaxies at @xmath83@xmath4 in the ers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for the relationship between our mass completeness limits and the distribution of galaxies in our hudf09 and ers source catalogs as a function of redshift ) .",
    "interestingly , as we confirm via artificial noise degradation analysis of the hudf09 images in the appendix to this paper , despite a @xmath214@xmath105 shorter exposure time the depth of the ers imaging is sufficient to perform morphological classification of the ( relatively crude ) nature described here at comparable accuracy to that in the hudf09 .",
    "the combined ( i.e. , @xmath106@xmath3@xmath4 ) fractions of objects in the four different classes are , respectively , @xmath107% , @xmath108% , @xmath109% and @xmath109% at @xmath103 , and @xmath110% , @xmath111% , @xmath112% and @xmath112% at @xmath104 ( with 1@xmath68 binomial uncertainties estimated using a bayesian approach ; cf .",
    "cameron 2010 ) .",
    "note that the evolution of these fractions likely implies substantial morphological transformations across the redshift @xmath38 epoch of peak star formation activity .",
    "we highlight , in particular , the emergence of a substantial population of regular disk morphologies , and a substantial increase in the fraction of spheroidal morphologies at epochs @xmath113 .",
    "importantly , the four morphological classes show different redshift and stellar mass distributions . at @xmath104 class",
    "3 objects ( with highly irregular morphologies also in rest - frame optical light ) and class 4 objects ( with small - sized , ` blob'-like morphologies ) are overwhelmingly dominant at both intermediate and high mass scales , while class 2 spheroids are largely restricted to above @xmath5 @xmath4 . at @xmath103 class 3 and class 4 objects are now largely restricted to intermediate masses , while the class 2 spheroid population now dominates at high masses . at @xmath103 the class 1 systems",
    "emerge and contribute @xmath225% of the morphological mix at both mass scales . at and around the epoch of peak cosmic star formation rate in the universe , therefore , the statistical census of the brightest galaxies indicates that the most massive of them are assembled in regular , hubble - type elliptical and disk ( plus bulge ) rest - frame optical morphologies , while less massive systems often reveal , in their rest - frame optical images , clear signs of dynamical youth .",
    "perhaps the most striking morphological difference between these two redshift intervals is the transition across the @xmath38 epoch for galaxies at the highest stellar masses , @xmath106@xmath114 , from a diversity of structural types to a dominant population of spheroids .",
    "although sed - fit based ssfrs suffer from large uncertainties , and our samples of galaxies with masses above @xmath114 at these redshifts are only small ( 16 at @xmath6 and 15 at @xmath7 ) , we note that the assembly of the massive spheroids appears to be accompanied by a rapid ` quenching ' of star formation .",
    "adopting a redshift - dependent division between star - forming and passively - evolving systems based on the ssfr necessary for a galaxy to double its stellar mass between its observed redshift and the present day , and employing our sed - fit ssfrs computed with zebra+ ( see section [ ssfrs ] ) , we find the fraction of star - forming galaxies at @xmath106@xmath114 falls from @xmath115% at @xmath6 to @xmath116 at @xmath7 .",
    "using our own color - based criteria for identification of a `` passively - evolving '' sed , i.e. , _ passive yhvz _ , the fraction of quenched galaxies above @xmath3 @xmath4 increases from @xmath117% at @xmath6 to @xmath118% at @xmath7 .",
    "this is consistent with the observed decline in the star - forming fraction estimated by feulner et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for a selection of galaxies in the fors - deep and goods - south fields .",
    "if confirmed by larger samples , these results would indicate that @xmath8 is the epoch when both morphological transformations first produce a significant population of massive spheroids and physical processes quench their star formation activity and move them to the red sequence , as expected in recent models ( peng et al .",
    "the wealth of wfc3 imaging of the high redshift universe achieved or planned , coupled with archival acs optical imaging , is self - sufficient , without additional ground - based photometry , to robustly identify galaxies in the @xmath0 redshift window . in this paper",
    "we have presented , to this aim , new , robust and efficient color - selection criteria established primarily on the @xmath85 vs.@xmath86 color - color diagram ( and similar ones , slightly less efficient but still valuable , which use combinations of the hst @xmath26 , @xmath15 , @xmath29 , and @xmath119 filters , or simply the @xmath29 , @xmath119 , and @xmath15 filters ) .",
    "we have also shown that an additional color selection on the @xmath85 vs.@xmath86 color - color diagram further enables the disentanglement of passively - evolving , ` quenched ' galaxies from actively star - forming galaxies at these redshifts .    as a first use of the new galaxy catalog that we have produced , starting from the @xmath15 wfc3 images ,",
    "we have performed a qualitative comparison of @xmath0 galaxy morphologies between rest - frame uv and rest - frame optical light .",
    "regular disk galaxies  with or without a bulge  are present at these epochs  the disk components being unseen or irregular in rest - frame uv images , and being clearly revealed in the rest - frame optical images .",
    "together with the population of smooth spheroids , these regular disk galaxies have substantial stellar masses , @xmath106@xmath120 ( or , for the spheroids , even above this threshold ) . at masses",
    "@xmath106@xmath114 , the wfc3 nir images reveal a transition of morphologies from a variety of structures at @xmath121 to a marked dominance of elliptical - like stellar distributions at @xmath113 . across the @xmath8 boundary the fraction of star - forming galaxies at @xmath106@xmath114 decreases from @xmath260% to @xmath25% .",
    "consistent with analysis of the @xmath122 population ( peng et al .",
    "2010 ) , and observed here in rest - frame optical morphologies and colors , @xmath38 appears therefore to be the epoch at which assembly and quenching of the massive spheroid population begins in earnest .",
    "the wfc3 nir images also reveal , however , that , less massive galaxies at the same epochs often keep a highly irregular morphology , also in the rest - frame optical light , as they had in the rest - frame uv light .",
    "this indicates that their previously reported irregular morphologies in rest - frame uv are not driven by detection of star - forming populations on top of settled , underlying older stellar populations , but rather an indication of a genuine juvenile dynamical state for much of the @xmath123@xmath4 galaxy population at these redshifts .",

    "we confirm through statistical image degradation that the limited depth of the ers imaging with wfc3/ir is indeed sufficient to allow for confident morphological classification of @xmath8 galaxies in the rest - frame optical , at least to the relatively crude level of detail employed in the analysis of section [ morph ] .",
    "adopting the ultra - deep hudf09 @xmath15 images of our @xmath9 master sample as the benchmark for morphological classification at these redshifts we thus aim to demonstrate a consistency of visual appearance following artificial degradation to the noise level of the ers . in particular , the net exposure time of the master udf @xmath15 image is a factor of @xmath214 times greater than that of the ers @xmath15 image ; indeed such an extraordinary depth at these wavelengths was crucial to the principal aim of the hudf09 program ",
    "namely , the search for @xmath124 - 10 candidates appearing as @xmath18/@xmath26 drop - outs ( bouwens et al .  2010a , 2011 ) .",
    "consequently , the contributions of both background sky noise and shot noise in the ers are @xmath2@xmath125 times higher than in the hudf09 .",
    "the final image noise in our master frames is , moreover , weakly correlated between adjacent pixels as a result of the reduction process .",
    "hence , rather than simply adding an independent noise component to each pixel to simulate the degradation in sky noise we attempt to at least partially approximate the impact of pixel - to - pixel correlation by degrading our udf images instead through the stacking of blank regions of real background sky . for the addition of shot noise ,",
    "however , we simply suppose that all flux detected above the 3@xmath68 sky noise level in the original udf images corresponds to real object flux , and we directly resample this flux ( with poisson uncertainty ) in the @xmath126 statistical package at the ers rate .    in figure [ fig13 ]",
    "we compare the original ( @xmath15 ) hudf09 postage stamp images of three archetypal class 1 ( disk , or bulge / disk ) systems from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , and three archetypal class 3 ( irregular ) systems from fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , against our new versions of these images degraded to the noise level of the ers .",
    "it is clear from inspection of this figure that the impact of the additional noise is to reduce the relative prominence of certain faint and/or fine - structure features in these @xmath8 galaxies , but that the broad morphological properties of each system ( e.g. , the presence / absence of multiple nuclei , a central bulge , an outer disk , or a warped disk ) remain readily discernable , and thus each galaxy remains clearly recognisable as a member of its assigned class .",
    "of course , studies attempting to achieve finer morphological classifications than those conducted here , or else attempting to perform quantitative ` clump - science ' ( e.g. , frster - schreiber et al .",
    "2011 ) , may well prove more sensitive to the imaging depth than our relatively crude analysis of section [ morph ] .",
    "further , one should not attempt to infer from the results of this appendix that certain quantitative morphological analysis procedures ( e.g. , bulge - disk decomposition ) will also prove insensitive to the difference in the hudf09 and ers imaging depths  such a statement clearly requires a more detailed investigation tailored to each morphological analysis tool under study .    as a further robustness test of the morphological evolution described in section [ morph ]",
    "we have investigated the possibility that the decreasing fraction of massive spheroids with increasing redshift ( past @xmath8 ) is an artifact of the impact of cosmological surface brightness dimming ( and band - pass shifting ) on our observations .",
    "in particular , we have verified that our visual classifications of all massive elliptical galaxies in our @xmath103 sub - sample remain consistent after artificial redshifting of their @xmath15 images to @xmath127 .",
    "the results of this redshifting for six archetypal @xmath128 ellipticals from our sample are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] .",
    "the extremely centrally - concentrated light profiles of these systems ensure that even under substantial cosmological surface brightness dimming they remain quite distinct in appearance from the remaining three classes ."
