    "reverberation mapping @xcite is the most widely applied method for measuring black hole masses in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it employs spectroscopic monitoring to derive the mass from the dynamics of the broad - line region ( blr ) clouds that orbit in the gravitational potential of the black hole .",
    "the emission - line width provides an estimate of the cloud velocity , while the time lag between the continuum and emission line ( usually h@xmath3 ) variability , caused by the light - travel time between the central continuum and the clouds , yields the blr size .",
    "thus , accurate flux calibration is essential for lag measurement in reverberation mapping .",
    "the most widely used method is the spectral scaling algorithm of ( * ? ? ?",

    "this level of uncertainty may lead to erroneous interpretation of agn light curves for objects with weak variability , as shown by @xcite for mrk 142 , whose variabilities in the @xmath11 and @xmath4 bands are @xmath12 3% @xcite .",
    "new methods for flux calibration in reverberation mapping observations would be valuable .",
    "the spectral fitting method has been used for emission - line measurements in several reverberation mapping studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it has proved to be an improvement in these cases to the traditional integration method . by measuring the flux of the [ o  iii ]  emission line , spectral fitting also naturally can be used for flux calibration , with the potential to achieve higher accuracy than the `` standard '' method of vgw92 . however , spectral fitting has not been adopted yet for flux calibration in previous reverberation studies ; @xcite and @xcite still used the method of vgw92 for flux calibration , while @xcite used a flux calibration strategy that does not rely on the [ o  iii ]  emission line but on simultaneous observations of a comparison star .",

    "the details of the observations and data reductions of lamp 2008 were presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the photometric monitoring of mcg6 - 30 - 15  included 48 epochs of @xmath11-band observations with a median cadence of 1.08 days and 55 epochs of @xmath4-band data with a median cadence of 1.04 days .",
    "the spectroscopy covered 42 epochs with a median cadence of 1.00 days .",

    "the scaled spectra are not calibrated accurately enough for studying the variability of h@xmath3  flux in this object .",
    "the spectral scaling algorithm of vgw92 does not depend on the measurement of the narrow - line flux , in order to avoid the uncertainty in the determination of the continuum , which is significant when the continuum is defined as a simple straight line set between two wavelength windows .",

    "thus , we recalibrate the reduced spectra by scaling to the [ o  iii ]  flux measured from an initial spectral fitting . then , we perform a second , more refined fitting on the recalibrated spectra to measure the light curves . before the initial fitting , we correct the reduced spectra for galactic extinction using the @xmath17-dependent law of @xcite and @xcite .",

    "compared to the preliminary fitting in section [ sec - recal ] , broad and narrow he ii  @xmath104686 and several narrow coronal lines are added , and some parameters are fixed to their values obtained from the best fit to the mean spectrum .",
    "note that the apparent flux variation of the host galaxy described in appendix a of @xcite also exists here , because the size of the [ o  iii]-emitting region is different from that of the host galaxy .",
    "this is evident from the absorption features in the root - mean - square ( rms ) spectrum in figure 6 of @xcite .",

    "the only difference between the procedure here and that of @xcite is that we now include narrow h@xmath3  in the fit , because it can be decomposed well in the mean spectrum .",
    "for each individual - night spectrum , we constrain the velocity width and shift of narrow h@xmath3  to be the same as those of [ o  iii ] , and we fix the intensity ratio of narrow h@xmath3  to [ o  iii ]  @xmath105007 to 0.13 , as given by the best - fit mean spectrum .",

    "the rms spectrum is preferred for representing the variable part of the emission line ( @xcite ; but see @xcite for biases ) .",
    "however , as mentioned in section [ sec - lc ] , the rms spectrum of mcg6 - 30 - 15  shows h@xmath3  absorption instead of emission because the apparent spectral variability is dominated by variations in the level of host galaxy contamination . here , following @xcite , we produce two sets of mean and rms spectra , an original set generated in the standard manner and another generated after subtracting the best - fit agn power - law continuum and host galaxy component from each individual spectrum .",
    "because only a scaling factor was applied to the reduced spectra ( see section [ sec - recal ] ) , our recalibrated spectra still suffer from small nightly offsets in wavelength shift and spectral resolution . skipping the corrections for these offsets does not influence our measurements afterwards because the widths and shifts of both h@xmath3  and [ o  iii ]  are free to vary in our fitting ; it conveniently allows us calculate the error of the recalibrated spectrum .",
    "however , the rms spectrum around strong narrow emission lines ( e.g. , [ o  iii ] ) is strongly affected by these nightly offsets .",
    "thus , before generating the mean and rms spectra , we correct the offsets by applying a linear wavelength shift and a gaussian broadening to each individual spectrum according to the [ o  iii]velocity shift and width measured in our preliminary fitting used for recalibration .        figure [ fig - rms ] shows the two sets of mean and rms spectra . the standard rms spectrum ( upper - middle panel ) resembles that presented in figure 6 of @xcite .",
    "it shows no h@xmath3  emission but absorption , because the variability of the h@xmath3  line is overwhelmed by the variations in the agn power - law continuum and the level of host galaxy contamination .",
    "after subtracting the best - fit continuum components , which includes both the agn power - law and the host galaxy from each individual spectrum , the resulting rms spectrum ( black curve in the bottom panel ) has much lower intensity than the original one , and shows emission features of h@xmath3  and [ o  iii ] .",
    "the blue curve in the bottom panel is the mean of the errors of individual - night spectra in each wavelength bin , which represents the minimal level of rms variations that could be generated .",
    "it is the expected rms spectrum of a non - varying object , for which the variations in the observed spectra are totally caused by the observational errors . by comparing the continuum - subtracted rms spectrum and the error spectrum ,",
    "the apparent variation of the [ o  iii ]  line can be mostly attributed to observational error ; it also illustrates that our recalibration works well . on the other hand ,",
    "the h@xmath3  line revealed in the continuum - subtracted rms spectrum is much stronger than the error , which means that the variability of the h@xmath3  line is observable and successfully measured by our spectral fitting .",
    "fitting a single gaussian with a local continuum to the h@xmath3  line in the continuum - subtracted rms spectrum yields a fwhm of 1104 @xmath6  ( after instrumental broadening correction ) , which is much narrower than the mean fwhm of the individual spectrum listed in table [ tab - meas ] , a possible consequence of biases due to the weak variability of the feature ( see @xcite for detailed discussions ) .      combining the time lag @xmath31 with the emission - line width @xmath57 provides an estimate of the virial mass of the black hole , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the speed of light , @xmath60 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath7 is a virial factor that absorbs the unknown geometry , kinematics , and orientation of the blr . as shown above , the usual way of measuring @xmath57 from the rms spectrum is not suitable for mcg6 - 30 - 15  here .",

    ", we analyze archival _ hst_/wfc3 images of this galaxy ( go-11662 , pi : bentz ) , for two purposes : ( 1 ) determining the bulge classification and ( 2 ) measuring the starlight flux contribution to the spectroscopic flux at 5100  .",
    "mcg6 - 30 - 15  was observed by the wfc3 ultraviolet - visible ( uvis ) channel with the f547 m filter ( see @xcite for the details of the observations ) .",
    "two sets of exposures with integration times of 25 , 370 , and 750 s were taken .",
    "we retrieve the flat - fielded images of the six exposures from the _ hst _ archives and replaced the saturated pixels in the long - exposure images with scaled versions of unsaturated pixels from the shallower exposures .",
    "then , we use the drizzlepac task astrodrizzle ( version 1.1.16 ; @xcite ) to clean cosmic rays , correct geometric distortion , and create the final combined image ( figure [ fig - host]a ) and error image .",
    "we generate point - spread function ( psf ) models using tiny tim ( version 7.5 ; @xcite ) for each exposure , and combine them in the same way as the galaxy images .",
    "we use galfit ( version 3.0.5 ; @xcite ) to perform two - dimensional surface brightness decomposition .",
    "the model includes the following components : ( 1 ) two psf profiles for the agn and the nearby bright star to the south , ( 2 ) two @xcite profiles for the bulge and disk of the host galaxy , and ( 3 ) a constant background sky .",
    "a dust mask is needed for the central dust lane ( figure [ fig - host]d ) .",
    "we generate it iteratively .",
    "we first fit the image without a dust mask and generate an initial mask using the pixels with negative residual values that exceed 5 times the error .",
    "then we refit the image with the dust mask and generate a new dust mask based on the new residuals .",
    "after a few iterations , both the dust mask and the best - fit parameters converge .",
    "the final converged dust mask is shown in figure [ fig - host](e ) ; its shape resembles that of the fuzzy dust lane .",
    "the final best fit using the converged dust mask has a reduced @xmath24 of 0.994 .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( c ) of figure [ fig - host ] show images of the best - fit model and residuals .",
    "panel ( f ) shows the one - dimensional surface brightness of the data ( with and without the dust mask ) , the best - fit model , and each component of the model , plotted in different colors .",
    "panel ( g ) shows the residuals .",
    "table [ tab - host ] lists the best - fit values of the parameters , which yield a bulge - to - total ( @xmath68 ) light ratio of 0.06 and a bulge srsic index @xmath62 = 1.29 .",
    "thus , we classify the bulge of mcg6 - 30 - 15  as a pseudobulge based on its low @xmath68 and @xmath62 @xcite .      using the results of the surface brightness decomposition",
    ", we measure the starlight contribution to the spectroscopic flux , following @xcite .",
    "the blue rectangle in figure [ fig - host](d ) shows the aperture ( 4@xmath697 ; @xcite ) in which the lamp 2008 spectra were extracted .",
    "we subtract the best - fit agn and sky components from the data image , and measure the flux within the aperture .",
    "then , we determine the color correction using the iraf _ synphot _ package and the galaxy template adopted in our spectral fitting ( section [ sec - lc ] ) .",
    "the host galaxy flux density contribution to the spectra at rest - frame 5100   is @xmath70 erg s@xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath20 , after correcting for galactic extinction . for comparison , our spectral decomposition in section [ sec - lc ]",
    "yields a somewhat lower average host galaxy flux density of @xmath71 erg s@xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath20 .",
    "the difference may come from the uncertainty in the spectral decomposition , especially when the spectral slope of the agn continuum has strong dust reddening , which is not tightly constrained @xcite .",
    "also , measuring the flux contribution from the image has an uncertainty of @xmath110% @xcite .",
    "finally , we obtain a starlight - subtracted agn flux density at 5100   of @xmath72 erg s@xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath20 .",
