    "the minos ( main injector neutrino oscillation search ) experiment is a complete long - baseline neutrino oscillation study .",
    "the numi ( neutrinos from the main injector ) neutrino beam created at fermi national accelerator laboratory ( fermilab ) is sampled first by the near detector ( nd ) , on - site at fermilab , at 1 km from the target , and then by the far detector ( fd ) , 735  km away in the soudan underground laboratory in minnesota .",
    "neutrino oscillation phenomena are studied by comparing the reconstructed neutrino energy spectra at the near and far locations .",
    "the numi neutrino beam is produced using 120gev protons from the main injector .",
    "the protons are delivered in 10@xmath2s spills with up to 4.0@xmath3 protons per spill .",
    "positively charged particles produced by the proton beam in a graphite target ( mainly @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) are focused by two pulsed parabolic horns and are then allowed to decay in a 675 m long , 2 m diameter decay pipe . the target position relative to the first horn and the horn current",
    "are variable .",
    "the data employed in this analysis were obtained using the low energy beam configuration , in which the peak neutrino energy is 3.3gev  @xcite , and were recorded between may 2005 and july 2007 , corresponding to a total exposure of 3.18@xmath6  protons on target ( pot ) .",
    "the charged current ( cc ) neutrino event yields at the nd are predicted to be 91.8% @xmath7 , 6.9% @xmath8 , 1.2% @xmath9 and 0.1% @xmath10 .",
    "the minos detectors are designed to be as similar as possible in order to minimize systematic uncertainties .",
    "the detectors are fine - grained tracking calorimeters with an inch thick absorber layer of steel and a 1  cm active layer of plastic scintillator constituting one `` plane '' .",
    "each scintillator layer is constructed from 4.1  cm wide strips .",
    "signals from the scintillator are collected via wavelength - shifting ( wls ) fibers and carried by clear optical fibers to photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "the nd and fd are both magnetized with a current - carrying coil producing an average field of 1.3 t in the fiducial volume .",
    "the 0.98kton nd , 103 m underground , has 282 irregular 4@xmath116m@xmath12 octagonal planes .",
    "the detector consists of two sections , a calorimeter encompassing the upstream 121 planes and a spectrometer containing the downstream 161 planes . in both sections , one out of every five planes",
    "is fully covered with 96 scintillator strips attached to the steel plates . in the calorimeter section , the other four out of five planes",
    "are partially covered with 64 scintillator strips whereas in the spectrometer section no scintillator is attached to the steel .",
    "the 5.4kton fd , 705 m underground , has 484 octagonal , 8 m wide instrumented planes . due to the nd proximity to the target ,",
    "the signal rate in the nd is @xmath13 times larger than in the far detector .",
    "there are two main types of neutrino interactions observed in the minos detectors : charged current ( cc ) interactions , proceeding through the exchange of a @xmath14 boson with creation of the associated charged lepton , typically defined by a long muon track accompanied by a small hadronic shower at the event vertex caused by nuclear fragmentation ; neutral current ( nc ) interactions , proceeding through exchange of a @xmath15 with the neutrino leaving the detector , which appear as diffuse showers with typical length much shorter than the length of a muon track in a cc event .",
    "correct identification of nc events in the minos detectors is difficult due to to short cc events with high hadronic inelasticity , featuring a short muon track often concealed by the hadronic shower or easily confused with the short charged pion tracks also found in nc events .    [ !",

    "events reconstructed in the fiducial volume of the near and far detectors are very similar .",
    "however , in the nd , an average of 16 neutrino interactions are produced for each 1.8@xmath16 spill during typical running with intensities of @xmath17pot per beam spill .",
    "reconstruction algorithms are designed to handle this high interaction rate , but for certain event subclasses shortfalls have been identified and quantified using special studies including low intensity beam data and visual scanning .",
    "reconstruction failures are classified into three main categories : i ) _ split events _ , ii ) _ leakage events _ , and iii ) _ incomplete events_. split events occur when a single neutrino interaction results in two or more reconstructed events .",
    "leakage events are due to incorrectly assigned event vertices causing neutrino interactions outside the fiducial volume to be reconstructed within it .",
    "the incomplete event category is a looser classification that refers to further types of failures in shower reconstruction to be described below . in all three categories , the visible energy of a neutrino candidate",
    "may be underestimated , resulting in a background to nc events at low energies . as nd data are used to predict the expected spectra at the fd , reconstruction failures specific to the nd",
    "must be minimized .",
    "a set of selection requirements based on spatial and timing criteria , as well as on activity on the nd sparsely instrumented regions , was developed  @xcite to reduce the occurrence of these failure modes .",
    "the selection criteria can be summarized as follows : i ) the time separation between events , @xmath18 , must exceed 40ns ; ii ) if 40ns  @xmath19  120ns , the spatial separation between events , @xmath20 , must exceed 1 m ; iii ) the ratio between the number of active strips per event plane and total number of active planes in the event must be less than unity ; iv ) for events with less than 5gev of reconstructed energy in which the number of planes is larger in the reconstructed shower than in the reconstructed track , the number of event strips reconstructed in the detector s veto regions should be less than four , or else the total pulse - height in those regions must be less than 2mip ; and v ) the total number of strips reconstructed in the event must be more than four .",
    "only events that satisfy these criteria are used for further analysis . after applying these requirements ,",
    "the background of poorly reconstructed events having visible energy below 1gev has been reduced from 34% to 8% . the distribution of the number of occupied strips per event is shown in fig .  [ fig : strips_cleaning ] .",
    "after the selection criteria described above are applied , the analysis proceeds by distinguishing nc events from cc events .",
    "the goal of the event classification is to maximize the efficiency and purity of selected samples of nc and cc events , with efficiency defined as the number of true events of one type which are classified as that type , divided by the total number of true events of that type .",
    "purity is defined as the ratio of the number of true events of one type selected to the total number of events selected as that type .",
    "a sample of candidate nc events is obtained by applying specific requirements on three classification variables : _ event length _",
    ", expressed as the difference between the first and last active plane in the event ; _ number of tracks _ reconstructed in the event ; and _ track extension _ , defined as the difference between track length and shower length .",
    "events crossing fewer than 60 planes and for which no track is reconstructed are classified as nc .",
    "events crossing fewer than 60 planes that contain a track are classified as nc if the track extends less than 5 planes beyond the shower .",
    "the values chosen maximize sensitivity for detection of sterile - neutrino admixture .",
    "finally , events that are not classified as nc - like are checked to determine if they are cc - like according to classification procedures described in a previous minos publication  @xcite .",
    "these requirements are applied to both nd and fd to obtain nc and cc event samples .",

    "the predictions of the energy spectra of the nc and cc samples at the fd are based on the observed nd data and make use of the expected relationship between the neutrino fluxes at the two sites .",
    "the process of making the predictions is called `` extrapolation '' and may be viewed as making corrections to the simulation of interactions in the fd based on the energy spectrum measured in the near detector .",
    "the current analysis uses an extrapolation technique called the `` far over near ( f / n ) '' method  @xcite .",
    "this method makes the prediction of the fd spectrum by taking the product of two quantities : the ratio of the expected number of events from the monte carlo simulation for each energy bin in the fd and nd spectra ; and the number of observed nd data events .",
    "the f / n method prediction is robust against distortions arising from differences between data and monte carlo simulation in the nd as these distortions are translated to the fd and do not affect the oscillation measurement  @xcite .",
    "for instance , for the case of the @xmath7  cc component of the nc and cc samples , the f / n extrapolation predicts the number of events at the fd for the @xmath21-th bin of reconstructed energy to be @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of selected events in the @xmath21-th reconstructed energy bin in the nd and @xmath24 is the number of events expected in that bin from the nd monte carlo simulation .",

    ", @xmath27 is the true neutrino energy and @xmath28 the probability of muon neutrino transition to any other flavor .",
    "the main sources of systematic uncertainties in the analysis are : i ) _ absolute scale of the hadronic energy _ ; ii ) _ relative calibration of the hadronic energy _ in the two detectors ; iii ) _ relative normalization _ between the two detectors ; iv ) _ cc background _ in selected nc events ; and v ) _ uncertainties due to the nd selection requirements _ in the nd event counts .",
    "monte carlo studies have been performed where for each single uncertainty the monte carlo spectrum is varied by @xmath291 standard deviation independently , in order to estimate the effect of each on the extrapolated spectrum .",
    "beam and cross - section uncertainties that are common to the two detectors effectively cancel when using the f / n extrapolation .",
    "the absolute hadronic energy scale has an uncertainty of 12% .",
    "this value is a combination of the uncertainty in the hadronization model and intranuclear effects ( 10% ) and uncertainty of the detector response to single hadrons ( 6% ) .",
    "the relative energy scale between the two detectors has an uncertainty of 3% .",
    "the relative normalization between the two detectors has an uncertainty of 4% .",
    "this is a combination of the uncertainties due to fiducial mass , live time , and reconstruction differences between the two detectors .    to evaluate the uncertainties due to the nd selection , the requirement that the total number of reconstructed strips in an event is at least four was shifted by @xmath30 strip .",
    "the effects on the reconstructed energy spectrum were determined for each shift .",
    "the uncertainty has been estimated to be 15.2% for @xmath310.5gev ; 2.9% for 0.5gev  @xmath32  1.0gev ; 0.4% for 1.0gev@xmath33  1.5gev and is negligible fpr higher visible energies .    finally , the uncertainty in the number of cc background events is determined using nd data taken in several different beam configurations . using the observed differences in energy spectrum between the low - energy beam configuration and each of the other beam configurations along with information from monte carlo simulation of each configuration , the uncertainty on the cc background number",
    "is found to be 15% for all energy ranges at the near and far detectors  @xcite .",
    "results from the miniboone experiment@xcite , which looked for @xmath34 or @xmath35 appearance on a short baseline of 540@xmath36 using a neutrino beam with a mean energy of @xmath37@xmath38 , mostly rule out the potential scenario of oscillations at the mass - squared @xmath39 scale , a possibility reported by the lsnd experiment@xcite .",
    "scenarios including active - sterile neutrino mixing with one or more sterile neutrinos have been put forward to explain the lsnd result .",
