    "hundreds of diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) are seen in the spectra of stars dimmed and reddened by interstellar dust @xcite .",
    "there have been many unsuccessful attempts to assign neutral or charged molecular carriers to either individual or families of these bands .",
    "@xcite proposed that a pair of dibs which they had detected at 9632 and 9577 were due to the fullerene ion c@xmath1 because of their proximity to laboratory absorption wavelengths observed in a neon matrix @xcite .",
    "@xcite have now proved that these dibs are indeed due to c@xmath1 .",
    "this is based on measurement of not only the wavelengths , but also the fwhm and relative intensities of these bands in the gas phase at @xmath0 .",
    "this successful identification , which came long after kroto first predicted the presence of @xmath2 in the interstellar medium @xcite , may be regarded as a first step towards unlocking the 90 year old mystery of the dib carriers ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also reported two weaker bands of roughly equal strength ( 3:2 ) at 9428.5 and 9365.9 in their laboratory spectra ( their table 1 ) . unfortunately , for ground based observations , both of these wavelengths lie in spectral regions heavily contaminated by telluric water vapour ( wv ) lines as can be seen in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "the standard technique for their removal is division of the reddened star spectrum by one from an unreddened star of similar spectral type observed through the same air mass .    in this paper , we report observations of hd 183143 chopped with those of a similar standard lying within @xmath3 on the sky . atmospheric wv absorption is likely to change with both time and direction as well as with air mass which is the reason for frequent chopping .",
    "hd 183143 is a bright , reddened , b7 supergiant which exhibits all of the known dibs with considerable strength @xcite including those at 9632 and 9577 .",
    "it also passes through the zenith at cfht where the atmospheric precipitable water level can be significantly lower than for sites at lower altitude .",
    "we were granted two hours of cfht director s discretionary time with espadons @xcite on the night of 2015 - 07 - 28 ut .",
    "hd  183143 and a nearby standard of similar spectral type , hr  7437 , were observed within one hour of meridian crossing with a sky temperature of @xmath4 indicating a low water vapour level .",
    "espadons was configured in spectropolarimetric mode consequently , a single spectrum consisted of four individual sub - exposures taken at different polarimeter retarder configurations .",
    "all of the spectra were reduced at cfht with the upena pipeline using the libre - esprit code @xcite .",
    "the spectral resolution is approximately 65,000 or 0.05 per pixel .",
    "details of the stars are given in table 1 which includes v and i magnitudes , and colour excess , @xmath5 .",
    "observations alternated between the two targets . in this way , four sets of spectra were acquired with air masses differing by @xmath6 within each pair .",
    "the total exposure times of 600 and @xmath7 within each set for hd  183143 and hr  7437 , respectively , were chosen to give similar signal levels for both stars in the 9400 region .",
    "telluric lines in typically 20 regions of interest in the spectrum of hd  183143 were removed using the subsequent hr  7437 spectrum as standard in the iraf telluric program .",
    "the four corrected spectra of hd  183143 from each of these spectral regions were then combined to produce the single high s / n spectra in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "estimation of s / n is complicated by the presence of the telluric lines within which s / n is low .",
    "based on our calculations , s / n @xmath8 1500 @xmath9 ( @xmath8 330 per pixel ) for hd  183143 in the region of the 9577.5 line after wv removal .",
    "there is a short gap in the espadons spectral coverage between 9608 and 9636 where the order lies off the detector .",
    "this gap prevented our looking for the 9632.7 band .",

    "the wavelength region of interest from 9300 to 9600 is covered in a single chelle spectral order ( 24 ) and shown in the lower plot of figure [ figure1 ] for hd 183143 .",
    "all of the strong lines , some near saturation , are due to telluric wv .",
    "the upper plot is the result of division by the spectrum of hr 7437 .",
    "note that the telluric line cancellation has not been optimized in the figure since in this case a single correction was applied to the full 300 region displayed .",
    "the narrow stellar hydrogen p8 line at 9546 in hd  183143 is superimposed on the reflex of the much broader p8 line in hr  7437 illustrating the impact of absorption lines in the standard star . the strong 9577.5 band of @xmath2 is easily seen .",
    "several other dibs are also visible .    to optimize telluric line removal we performed these corrections over more limited spectral ranges containing the wavelengths of the @xmath2 laboratory absorptions .",
    "this produced higher s / n spectra for the 9577.5 , 9428.5 and 9365.8 regions as well as a region centered on the interstellar potassium line at 7699.0 in order 29 .",
    "small zero point adjustments were made to the levels of the hd  183143 and hr  7437 spectra to minimize residuals in the ratios at the centres of the strongest wv lines .",
    "the ratios are shown for the four regions in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "the persistence of some residuals at the centres of the strongest telluric lines is likely associated with non - linearity of the analog to digital converter over the extreme range of intensity of the lines rather than inequality of water vapour optical depth .",
    "figure [ figure2 ] also shows the two components of the hd  183143 interstellar 7699.0 potassium absorption line after removal of nearby telluric lines .",
    "the stronger component has a radial velocity of @xmath1012 km s@xmath9 , the other component + 4 km s@xmath9 . at 9577.5 , 9428.5 and 9365.8",
    ", @xmath11 corresponds to a displacement of @xmath100.4 .",
    "we use this value in what follows assuming that the corresponding cloud is the main contributor to the detected dibs .",
    "@xcite fitted gaussians to the laboratory absorptions at @xmath0 and listed wavelengths and fwhms ( their table 1 ) . the dibs in figure [ figure2 ] were also fitted with unconstrained gaussians as shown by the dashed lines including the obvious dib at @xmath12 .",
    "no dibs could be observed in the region of the @xmath13 laboratory absorption because of the emission feature at 9429 .",
    "the emission must be associated with hd  183143 because the comparison star , hr  7437 , is a rapid rotator ( @xmath14 ) such that absorption lines in hr  7437 would produce much broader ( @xmath15 8 ) apparent emission features in the ratio .",
    "there are many such emission lines between 9300 and 9600 for hd  183143 .",
    "@xcite published spectra in this region , and encountered emission lines in either their reddened or standard stars ( their figure 4 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the latter study , which was published long before the gas phase spectrum of c@xmath1 was recorded , both a ` depression ' near @xmath16 and the suggestion of a weak feature around @xmath17 were reported .",
    "figure [ figure3 ] shows the regions of the 9577.5 , 9428.5 and 9365.9 laboratory bands for the b1 ia star hd  169454 divided by the spectrum of the rapidly rotating ( @xmath18 ) ao v star hd  177724 , again using the iraf telluric program .",
    "details of the stars are given in table 1 .",
    "these processed spectra were downloaded from the canadian astronomy data centre s cfht archive .",
    "both stars were observed in the `` object only '' spectroscopic configuration of espadons on 2005 - 05 - 21 ut .",
    "we selected hd 169454 because it has none of the emission features found in hd 183143 .",
    "unfortunately , the standard was not observed at an identical air mass and so there are large wv line residuals at 9427.5 and 9428.2 which have been omitted and replaced by averages in the plots and when fitting a gaussian .",
    "the principal interstellar k line ( 7699.0 ) is unresolved with a radial velocity of @xmath1011 km  s@xmath9 which translates to @xmath100.4 at 9400 .",
    "table  2 summarises the results of unconstrained gaussian fits to the features in all of the ratioed spectra .    given",
    "the weakness ( @xmath19 ) of the detected bands and the presence of apparent emission features , setting of continua was subjective , particularly in the case of hd  169454 .",
    "further , the ccd detector is partially transparent at such long wavelengths which generates interference fringes .",
    "these are not well cancelled in the flat fielding process but the additional normalization when dividing by the telluric standard considerably reduces their amplitude .",
    "consequently , it is hard to establish values for systematic errors with confidence particularly for the fwhm in the case of hd  169454 . in the table ,",
    "only formal fitting errors are given .",
    "the agreement of the astronomical and laboratory wavelengths is remarkably good considering the somewhat ad hoc nature of assigning an interstellar velocity .",
    "in addition , support for the assignment to @xmath2 comes from comparison with the relative intensities reported in the laboratory measurements .",
    "the depth of the astronomical bands ( table 2 ) can be used to estimate the relative intensity of the absorption bands for symmetric profiles .",
    "the observations towards hd  183143 give a ratio of 1:0.3 for the 9577.5 and 9365.9 bands .",
    "this matches with the laboratory ratio of 1:0.2 which was reported with an estimated uncertainty of around 20% @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of the depth values derived from the archive hd  169454 spectra , 1:0.3:0.2 for the 9577.5 , 9428.5 and 9365.9 dibs , are also in agreement with 1:0.3:0.2 measured in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "the fwhm of 3.3 for the interstellar 9577.5 band in hd  183143 is comparable to the value of 2.85 reported by @xcite and 3.0 by @xcite for other reddened stars . in the laboratory study at @xmath0",
    "the measured fwhm are @xmath20 . at this low temperature ,",
    "the fwhm of the @xmath2 rotational profile is around 1 @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the laboratory bands are broadened by the @xmath21 lifetime of the excited electronic state . only at temperatures above 30 k",
    "would one see a further broadening of the rotational profile .",
    "the fwhm values for hd  169454 are not robust because of incomplete correction for telluric contamination and arbitrariness in setting the continuum . a more likely source for the extra broadening of the 9577.5 band in hd  183143 would be near coincidence with another dib .",
    "for example , there is a close dib to the 9365.9 band at 9362.5 ( figure [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "the confirmation of the presence of @xmath2 in diffuse clouds raises the question of its interstellar abundance .",
    "this has been considered previously , see , for example @xcite , and references therein .",
    "the calculation of column density relies on the knowledge of the individual band oscillator strength , @xmath22 , the wavelength of the absorption band maximum , @xmath23 , and the equivalent width , @xmath24 . for this purpose",
    "the value for the electronic transition which was estimated in the matrix isolation spectroscopy study by @xcite , @xmath25 , has invariably been used .",
    "however , this value is an order of magnitude smaller than indicated by theory @xcite .",
    "we believe that the value from the matrix study is underestimated and in the following @xmath26 is used .    in order to evaluate the @xmath22 value for the @xmath27 band",
    "the electronic oscillator strength must be weighted by the franck - condon factor . in the case of @xmath2 ,",
    "most of the oscillator strength is localized in the two strong features at @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "based on observation of only weak @xmath2 laboratory absorptions to shorter wavelength than @xmath13 , we estimate the 9577.5 band to account for @xmath30 of the intensity and therefore obtain @xmath31 . for the 9577.5 dib observed towards hd  183143",
    "the equivalent width is estimated to be @xmath32 ( table 2 ) .",
    "using these values gives a column density , @xmath33 , of around @xmath34 .",
    "for comparison , this is an order of magnitude smaller than that of @xmath35 but similar to @xmath36 , both of which were observed towards hd  183143 @xcite .",
    "two weak diffuse interstellar bands have been detected with wavelengths , fwhm and relative intensities in agreement with the laboratory spectrum of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these results provide further compelling evidence for the presence of this molecular ion in the interstellar medium .",
    "it has been suggested that the @xmath37 and @xmath27 absorptions , and hence @xmath2 , are also present in protoplanetary nebulae @xcite .",
    "the existence of the neutral fullerenes @xmath38 and @xmath39 in a young planetary nebula @xcite and reflection nebulae @xcite has been confirmed through their infrared ( ir ) transitions .",
    "there is also a report of ir emission features from a reflection nebula which have been proposed to be due to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the identification of @xmath2 in diffuse clouds leads to intriguing questions regarding the role of fullerenes with respect to the formation of smaller carbon based molecules such as those identified in dense interstellar clouds by radioastronomy .",
