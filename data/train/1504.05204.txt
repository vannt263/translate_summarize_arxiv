    "we model the expansion of the pressure - inflated radio cocoon in a spherically symmetric external atmosphere with an arbitrary density and temperature profile .",
    "the external atmosphere is partitioned into small radial regions in which the external density and temperature are each approximated by a simple power law profile . the density profile in each small region",

    "dynamical models of powerful type ii radio sources show that the overpressured cocoons expand self - similarly , i.e. the shape of the cocoon remains fixed @xcite .",

    "we therefore model the cocoon as an ensemble of small volume elements in pressure equilibrium , where the growth of each element is otherwise independent . in the subsonic phase we further consider rayleigh - taylor instabilities expanding about the surface of this volume ( see section [ sec : rayleigh - taylor mixing ] ) .    in order to quantify the energetics of the adiabatic expansion of the radio source we need expressions for the volume of the cocoon and its pressure .",

    "the subsonic expansion phase , however , must be considered separately from the supersonic phase due to the discontinuity in cocoon pressure in equation [ hotspot pressure 4 ] .",
    "we note that the hotspot diameters of typical fr - ii sources are approximately 100 times smaller than the linear size of their cocoons @xcite .",
    "the energy stored in these high pressure hotspots can therefore be neglected from equation [ adiabatic expansion ] since it is small compared to that stored in the rest of the cocoon .",
    "we first consider the supersonic phase expansion of ensemble elements in the cocoon .",
    "substituting the relevant expressions for the pressure and volume of each element into equation [ adiabatic expansion ] yields a second order differential equation , which can not be solved analytically in general .",
    "we therefore adopt a numerical scheme using a fourth order runge - kutta method by rewriting the differential equation as a system of two first order odes .",

    "the solution to this differential equation is of the form @xmath60 .",
    "however , this expression can only be used to model the evolution of a radio source that is subsonic for its entire lifetime . in particular , the ensemble element radius predicted by the subsonic solution at the sonic boundary differs from that of the supersonic phase ( equation [ supersonic system ] ) , because the subsonic solution ignores the previous ( supersonic ) expansion history of the radio cocoon .",
    "the expansion in the subsonic phase must therefore be solved numerically , using the supersonic phase solution as an initial condition .",
    "we thus rewrite our analytic solution as a system of differential equations ,    @xmath61    where again the first equation gives the velocity and the second the acceleration for each ensemble element .",

    "we approximate the density and temperature profiles as a series of power law segments ( typically 100 segments per source ) , and ensure the continuity of ensemble element sizes and pressures across the region boundaries .",

    "synchrotron - emitting electrons will lose energy through adiabatic , synchrotron and inverse compton losses .",
    "we follow the formalism of @xcite , modifying their equation 16 to include our multi - power law pressure profile .",
    "the total cocoon luminosity ( i.e. both lobes ) at frequency @xmath69 is then given by    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the thompson cross - section , @xmath72 is the speed of light , @xmath73 is the adiabatic index of the magnetic field , @xmath74 is the electron energy injection index and @xmath75 @xcite .",

    "that is , the source age decreases as roughly @xmath88 in agreement with equations 4 and 5 of @xcite for supersonic expansion . in this work ,",
    "we calculate our results using @xmath87 but retain this uncertainty factor in equations so these results can be readily scaled for any realistic choice of this variable , e.g. @xmath89 .    a typical luminosity  size track produced by our model is shown in figure [ fig : pdtrack ] . our new model predicts a very different temporal evolution of agn size and luminosity compared to the standard fr - ii models .",
    "this has a large effect on the derived jet powers and ages of observed agn .",
    "the luminosity increases initially in the core regions where the density of the host environment is roughly constant ( with radius ) before decreasing as the density profile steepens towards @xmath90 .",
    "this behaviour is similar to that found in 3d mhd simulations of radio jets in a range of environments @xcite .",
    "by contrast , dynamical models which assume a single @xmath91 power law profile ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* not shown in figure ) predict the luminosity decreases monotonically with increasing size .",
    "our model also predicts the source luminosity will rise suddenly upon entering the transonic expansion phase .",
    "this increase occurs since the cocoon pressure equilibrates with that of the host environment rather than continuing to drop off at the rate predicted by the fr - ii model .",
    "@xcite find a similar increase in luminosity using their pressure - limited expansion model for fr - is .",
    "the fall in luminosity beyond @xmath67 is due to the rayleigh - taylor mixing of the cocoon with the host environment as detailed in section [ sec : rayleigh - taylor mixing ] .",
    "as the radio source expansion slows down , the cocoon becomes susceptible to the rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "different parts of the cocoon become subsonic with respect to the ambient medium at different times . as the cocoon plasma becomes entrained by this surrounding medium , the high energy synchrotron electrons in the cocoon will be collisionally reduced to the ambient energy level of the much denser surrounding atmosphere .",

    "the mean jet power of the herg population is higher than that of the lergs by @xmath242 ( @xmath243 significance ) , as shown in figure [ fig : qtplot ] .",
    "this result holds even when the nine hergs are compared with a sub - population of lergs with the same distribution of stellar masses .",
    "these higher herg jet powers are expected due to the higher black hole accretion rates in minor mergers .",
    "moreover , the mean active lifetime of the hergs is @xmath244 lower than for the low - excitation population , with this difference significant at the @xmath245 level .",
    "these younger herg active ages likely result from these galaxies being associated with short lived epochs of high accretion arising from the merger of the host with a gas rich system @xcite .",

    "although 43% of all radio sources in our sample have emission below the formal line flux uncertainties at the 3@xmath160 level , this fraction falls to less than 10% for objects classified as either hergs or lergs by @xcite .",
    "following on from their work we adopt the @xmath241 upper limit to [ oiii ] luminosity for such sources . in order to compare our accretion rate estimates with the theoretical expectations we need to correct for the survey selection effects .",
    "there are two factors we must consider : first , the drop - out of lower luminosity sources due to rayleigh - taylor mixing and late time loss mechanisms ; and second , the greater likelihood of detecting long - lived sources from the total population compared to their younger counterparts .",
    "specifically , the number density of sources in the population is probabilistically expected to be inversely proportional to its active age , @xmath255 .",
    "the number of radio agn missing due to the drop - out of low - luminosity sources is insignificant in comparison , as we discuss here .",

    "by contrast , all high jet power sources ( @xmath258 ) younger than @xmath259 can be detected with our survey .",
    "the distribution of counts of these high jet power sources in active lifetime space can thus be scaled to the source count at lower jet powers to predict the number of missing objects . in this manner",
    ", we find that at least half of the @xmath260 jet power sources expected from the counts of @xmath261 sources are observed . by contrast",
    ", correcting for the likelihood of observing objects based on their lifetimes yields a factor of ten increase in number density of radio sources for each order of magnitude decrease in the active age .",
    "moreover , the derived active ages cover a much larger range ( 4 orders of magnitude ) than the jet power ( @xmath262 ) .",
    "hence , correcting observations for age bias is more important than the effects of different jet powers .",

    "the smaller `` bump '' in the observed distribution ( dashed red line ) at an efficiency of approximately @xmath286 is not consistent with this theoretical model .",
    "these sources have median radio luminosities a factor of 45 greater than the rest of the lerg population , whilst sizes , jet powers and active lifetimes are 25 times larger .",
    "the typical sizes of these sources radio cocoons are of the order of @xmath287 with a median active lifetime of @xmath288 .",
    "the transit time of plasma along their jets leads to a lag of order @xmath289 to @xmath290 between changes in the central engine being reflected in the radio lobe emission .",
    "the observed radio luminosity from the cocoon may therefore reflect an earlier time with higher accretion rates than the present .",
    "we speculate that these objects predicted by our model may be `` dying '' quasars .",
    "the jet production efficiency of a thin disk accretion flow agn ( observationally identified with a herg ) is similarly derived using equation 5 of @xcite .",
    "that is ,    @xmath291    the highest efficiency that can be produced by this mechanism for the accretion rates of our sample is @xmath292 .",
    "two of the nine hergs in our sample have lower jet production efficiencies , however , seven have efficiencies exceeding this value rising up to @xmath293 .",

    "* noting that the high efficiency sources have such accretion rates ) .",
    "these accretion flows have a geometrically thin outer disk but a puffed up inner region like an adaf .",
    "black holes fuelled by such accretion flows could produce jets moderately efficiently due to the adaf core but still exhibit the strong emission lines of hergs .",
    "we presented a new dynamical model for jet - driven radio source evolution .",
    "this model differs in three respects from previous models : ( 1 ) it includes both the supersonic and subsonic cocoon expansion phases , ( 2 ) uses external pressure profiles based on semi - analytic galaxy formation models and x - ray observations , and ( 3 ) includes the rayleigh - taylor mixing of the cocoon with the surrounding material .",
    "we applied our model to a low - redshift volume - limited sample of radio agn , and estimated the jet powers and active lifetimes of these objects .",
    "radio sources in massive galaxies were found to remain active for longer , spend less time in the quiescent phase , and inject more energy into their hosts than their less massive counterparts .",
    "the majority of agn energy output in the low - redshift universe is provided by sources in massive hosts with @xmath230 luminosities .",
    "the relationship between the agn jet powers and the stellar masses of their host galaxies , @xmath205 , is in agreement with the theoretically expected ( lack of ) dependence for maintenance - mode agn feedback .",
    "the host haloes of these agn are likely to be in or close to long - term heating - cooling balance , when considering both thermal conduction and the suppression of gas cooling by the agn .",
    "our dynamical model can also explain the observed fr - i / ii radio morphology dichotomy .",
    "high - excitation radio galaxies were found to have active lifetimes on average a factor of twelve lower and jet powers a factor of four higher than the low - excitation radio galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the sporadic nature of their merger - driven cold gas accretion .",
    "the bimodality in lerg / herg accretion rates is consistent with the divide between the adaf and thin disk accretion flow mechanisms at approximately @xmath4 .",
    "the high - excitation radio galaxies in our sample were found to be a factor of three times less efficient at producing jets than the lergs .",
    "the derived jet production efficiencies are broadly consistent with the ranges allowed by radiatively efficient and inefficient flow jet production models .",
    "the jet production efficiency of the lowest accretion rate hergs exceeds the maximum predicted for a thin disk accretion flow , which we suggest provides support for the `` combined disk '' accretion flow model .",
    "the improved characterisation of the interaction between agn and their host galaxies resulting from this work should provide valuable input into galaxy formation and evolution models .",
    "this model will also be a useful tool in the interpretation of high redshift survey data , especially for _ square kilometre array _",
    "( ska ) pathfinder surveys .",
    "an important development will be extending the model to estimate source ages from observed spectral indices , since the resolution of the radio cocoons may not be possible except for the largest sources ( e.g. @xmath295 at @xmath296 for askap emu ) . at lower redshifts , future sensitive x - ray surveys of the gas density and temperature profiles of the agn environments ( e.g. athena )",

    "the working surface pressure at each angle @xmath29 differs from that along the jet axis due to the non - spherical nature of the cocoon .",
    "there are two relevant pressures here : the external pressure due to the ambient medium , and ram pressure due to the cocoon expansion .",
    "the latter requires a conversion from the radial expansion rate of each cocoon element to the velocity normal to its surface .",
    "sections of the cocoon expanding supersonically will maintain self - similar growth ( approximately self - similar when outside strong - shock limit ) and can thus be modelled by an ellipsoid with a constant axis ratio @xmath32 .",
    "the component of the velocity normal to the surface at angle @xmath29 is related to the expansion rate along the jet axis @xmath297 through      where we have defined a dimensionless velocity @xmath46 .",
    "this coefficient can be calculated with a typical value of the cocoon axis ratio for powerful fr - ii sources .",
    "we now need to relate this normal velocity along the jet axis , @xmath297 , to the rate of cocoon expansion in the @xmath29 direction for the assumed ellipsoidal cocoon .",
    "the radial distance to the working surface at angle @xmath29 from the central black hole is related to the radius along the jet axis @xmath31 by      where we have defined a dimensionless radius @xmath45 .",
    "the velocity normal to the surface at each angle @xmath29 is therefore related to the radial expansion rate of the relevant cocoon volume element through @xmath300 .",
    "these definitions for the dimensionless radius and velocity are also useful in describing the initial self - similar growth phase of the entire cocoon . here , these equations allow for analytically tractable solutions for the expansion of each volume element and thus the fraction of the jet power required by each element to maintain self - similarity . in the strong - shock supersonic limit",
    "we find the jet power is proportional to the angular location of the volume element as"
