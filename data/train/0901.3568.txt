    "recently @xcite , we have shown how two - way quantum communication can profitably be exploited to enhance the security of continuous variable quantum key distribution @xcite . in particular , we have investigated the security of two - way protocols in the presence of collective gaussian attacks which are modelled by combinations of entangling cloners @xcite . even though this situation is the most important one from the point view of the practical implementation , the effect of other kind of gaussian attacks ( i.e. , not referable to entangling cloners ) must also be analyzed . in this paper , we study the security of the two - way coherent - state protocol of ref .",
    "@xcite against individual attacks where an eavesdropper ( eve ) combines two different gaussian quantum cloning machines ( also called _ gaussian cloners _ ) .",
    "in particular , we are able to show the robustness of the two - way protocol when the first cloner is fixed to be symmetric in the output clones .",
    "this symmetry condition enables us to derive the results quite easily but clearly restricts our security analysis to a preliminary stage .",
    "for this reason , the _ optimal _ performance of gaussian cloners against two - way quantum cryptography is still unknown at the present stage .",
    "consider a stochastic variable @xmath0 with values @xmath1 distributed according to a gaussian probability @xmath2 \\ , ,   \\label{real_gauss}\\]]with variance @xmath3 .",
    "this variable is taken as input of a classical channel that outputs another stochastic variable @xmath4 with values @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , the classical channel is called _ additive gaussian channel _ if , for every input @xmath6 , the conditional output @xmath7 is gaussianly distributed around @xmath6 with some variance @xmath8 note . as a consequence ,",
    "the output variable @xmath4 is a gaussian variable with zero mean and variance @xmath9 . according to shannon s theory @xcite ,",
    "the classical correlations between the input and output variables lead to a mutual information @xmath10where @xmath11 is the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "this formula gives the maximal number of bits per gaussian value that can be sent through a gaussian channel with a given snr ( on average and asymptotically ) .",
    "in quantum information theory , an example of additive gaussian channel is provided by the gaussian quantum cloning machine ( gqcm ) @xcite .",

    "a @xmath18  gqcm is a completely - positive trace - preserving linear map @xmath19such that the single clone states , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , are given by a gaussian phase - space modulation of the input state @xmath22where @xmath23 \\text { , }   \\label{gamma}\\]]and @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , the quantities @xmath25 are the error variances induced by the cloning process on both the @xmath6 and @xmath26 quadratures of the @xmath27-th clone . notice that here we consider a gqcm which clones symmetrically in the quadratures ( in general , one can have a gaussian cloner which is asymmetric both in the clones and the quadratures , with four different noise variances @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 . )",
    "the previous variances do not depend on the input state ( _ universal _ gqcm ) and satisfy the relation@xmath32imposed by the uncertainty principle .",
    "in particular , the previous gqcm is said to be _ optimal _ if @xmath33 . in terms of shannon s theory ,",
    "each of the two real variables , @xmath6 and @xmath26 , is subject to an additive gaussian channel with noise equal to @xmath25 during the cloning process from the input state to the output @xmath27-th clone .",
    "the protocol is sketched in fig.[fig1 ] and consists of two configurations , _ on _ and _ off _ , that can be selected by alice with probabilities @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "let bob prepare a _ reference _ coherent state @xmath36 , with amplitude @xmath37 randomly chosen in the complex plane ( e.g. , according to a gaussian distribution with a _",
    "large _ variance ) .",
    "such a state is sent to alice on the forward use of the quantum channel . in the on  configuration , alice encodes a _ signal _ on this reference state via a phase - space displacement @xmath38 whose amplitude @xmath39 is chosen  in the @xmath40-plane according to a random gaussian distribution @xmath41 with _",
    "variance @xmath3 .",
    "notice that    ( i ) : :    the _ signal _ amplitude @xmath42 symmetrically encodes two    signal quadratures , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , i.e. ,    two independent and real random variables distributed according to    gaussian distributions @xmath45 and @xmath46 . (",
    "ii ) : :    the output state    @xmath47encodes the    signal amplitude @xmath42 , masked by the reference    amplitude @xmath48 chosen by bob .",
    "the state is finally sent back to bob , who tries to guess the two alice s numbers @xmath43 and @xmath44 by a joint measurement of conjugate observables @xcite .",
    "this is accomplished by a heterodyne detection @xcite of the state , which will give an outcome @xmath49 .",
    "after the subtraction of the known value @xmath37 , bob achieves an estimate @xmath50 of alice s complex amplitude @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    in the case of a noiseless channel between alice and bob , the only noise in all the process is introduced by the heterodyne detection .",
    "this measurement can be seen as a further gaussian additive channel at bob s site , which gives a gaussian noise equal to @xmath54 for each quadrature .",
    "thus , according to shannon s formula , we have @xmath55with @xmath56 .",
    "let us now consider a noisy channel adding gaussian noise with variances @xmath57 ( in the forward path ) and @xmath58 ( in the backward path ) for each quadrature .",
    "then , the total noise of the channel is @xmath59 and the total noise which bob tests , after detection , is equal to @xmath60 , giving a snr @xmath61 . in the off configuration , alice and",
    "bob estimate the noise in the channel by performing two heterodyne detections .",
    "after receiving the reference state , alice simply heterodynes it with outcome @xmath62 and then reconstructs a coherent state @xmath63 .",
    "this state is sent to bob , who gets the outcome @xmath64 after detection . in this way ,",
    "alice and bob collect the pairs @xmath65 and @xmath66 from which they can estimate the two noises @xmath8 and @xmath67 of the channel via public communications .",
    "notice that here we are using the on configuration to encode the key and the off configuration to check the noise of the channel .",
    "this means that we are implicitly assuming that eve s attack is disjoint between the two paths of the quantum communication ( i.e. , eve is using two distinct one - mode gqcms ) .",
    "more generally , in order to exclude joint attacks between the two paths , the on and off  configurations must be used symmetrically for encoding and checking @xcite .",
    "in the previous two - way quantum communication , the choices of the reference @xmath68 and the signal @xmath42 are two independent processes . as a consequence , eve has to extract information on both the reference @xmath37 and the total displacement @xmath69 in order to access alice s encoding @xmath42 ( this is true until the attack is disjoint ) .",
    "let us consider two different attacks , one on the forward use of the channel and the other one in the backward use , by using two optimal gqcms which we call @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "since the reference @xmath37 and the signal @xmath42 are chosen with large variances , such machines must be universal , and since the information is symmetrically encoded in the two quadratures , we consider equal cloning noises in @xmath6 and @xmath26 .",
    "for these reasons , eve s gqcms are exactly of the kind specified by eq .",
    "( [ gauss_clon ] ) with @xmath72 . after cloning",
    ", eve must extract the information about @xmath73 from her clones .",
    "she can directly heterodyne the clones .",
    "alernatively , she can send the clones to a beam - splitter ( bs ) , with suitable reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and then heterodynes the output ports .",
    "in order to study the eavesdropping depicted in fig .  [ fig1 ] , it is not sufficient to consider the reduced states @xmath76 of the two single clones at the output of @xmath77 , but we have to compute explicitly the whole bipartite state @xmath78  of modes @xmath54 and @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , mode @xmath54 is sent to alice ( who displaces it ) and then cloned by @xmath71 into the output modes @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the second mode @xmath81 then interferes with the previous mode @xmath79 on the beam - splitter .",
    "for this reason , we have to keep all the correlations between the various modes till the interference process .",
    "one can prove that the bipartite state @xmath78 at the output of the optimal gqcm @xmath77 is a gaussian state with correlation matrix ( cm ) equal to@xmath82where @xmath83 is the @xmath84 identity matrix .",
    "the cm of eq .",
    "( [ cm ] ) has _ positive partial transpose _ for every @xmath85 , and , therefore , @xmath78 is always a separable state @xcite .",
    "this means that eve can not exploit strategies based on the entanglement between her clones and the ones of alice and bob . in the particular case of symmetric cloning ( @xmath86 )",
    ", we can write the useful decomposition@xmath87then , let us consider the case where the first cloner @xmath77 is optimal and symmetric ( @xmath88 ) , while the second cloner @xmath89 is optimal but asymmetric , with @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in this case , at the output modes @xmath92 and @xmath93 of the bs",
    ", we have the bipartite state@xmath94where@xmath95and @xmath96if we now take a balanced bs ( i.e. , @xmath97 ) we have @xmath98 and , therefore , the output port @xmath93 does no longer contain the reference @xmath37 . here , the action of the bs  is very similar to the sum(mod2 ) performed over a binary key ( @xmath27 ) and the corresponding encrypted message ( @xmath99 ) , operation that reveals the message in the classical case ( @xmath100 ) . on the other hand , the other port @xmath92 still contains a mixing between @xmath42 and @xmath37 and , therefore , does not provide further information about the signal .",
    "tracing out this port , we have@xmath101heterodyning such a state , eve can estimate the value of @xmath42 up to a gaussian noise with variance @xmath102for each quadrature . for bob , instead , we have a total noise @xmath103equal to the sum of the heterodyne noise ( @xmath54 ) and the total channel noise @xmath104according to shannon , bob ( @xmath105 ) and eve ( @xmath106 ) will share with alice ( @xmath107 ) a mutual information equal to @xmath108 with @xmath109 for @xmath110 . since @xcite @xmath111we can easily compute a security threshold for this kind of attack , which is equal to @xmath112such a threshold must be compared with the security threshold ( @xmath113 ) which characterizes one - way coherent - state protocols @xcite against individual gqcm attacks .",
    "in this paper we have considered one of the two - way protocols introduced in @xcite .",
    "then , we have explicitly studied its security in the presence of particular kind of individual attacks which are based on combinations of one - mode gaussian cloners .",
    "our analysis indicates that the superadditive behavior of the security threshold should also hold against this kind of gaussian attacks .",
    "however , our analysis is far to be complete since we have considered only particular combinations of cloners and we have also excluded the possibility of a two - mode cloner ( acting coherently on both the paths of the quantum communication ) .",
    "furthermore , the analysis covers the case of direct reconciliation only . despite these restrictions ,",
    "the present work represents the first step in the security analysis of two - way protocols against more exotic kind of gaussian interactions .",
