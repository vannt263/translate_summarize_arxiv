    "in condensed matter systems with nodal fermionic spectra , quantum description of low - energy excitations can resemble that of the ultrarelativistic electron .",
    "the crystal space group imposes a generic restriction on such quasiparticles known as fermion doubling : they come in pairs of opposite chirality species that can be mapped to the conventional `` right - handed '' ( rh ) and `` left - handed '' ( lh ) fermions of the dirac theory .",
    "@xcite the most recently studied examples are graphene , where two distinct fermi points in the brillouin zone give rise to both chiral species ,  @xcite and 2d hgte quantum wells where spin - orbit coupling effectively results in a pair of the rh and lh fermions at low energies .",
    "@xcite the fermion doubling brings the symmetry with respect to the exchange of the chiralities , rh @xmath0 lh , related to the parity symmetry of the dirac equation .",
    "@xcite it is of considerable interest to investigate the consequences of the violation of such a symmetry , since they could be observable in materials where quasiparticles imitate dirac electrons . besides , the dirac fermion parity is distinct from other discrete symmetries ( e.g. time - reversal invariance ) , and , therefore , through its violation one could achieve additional control over electronic properties of the material .    it has been noticed  @xcite that discrete symmetries of a dirac fermion system can be broken , along with the translational invariance , by the boundaries of the system . in this paper",
    "we focus on the parity violation due to such a boundary effect and suggest how to detect and , possibly , use it in electronic devices .",
    "our main assumption is that the boundary does not cause scattering between the opposite chirality quasiparticles .",
    "to model this we use effective boundary conditions ,  @xcite interpolating between the infinite mass confinement  @xcite and the zigzag graphene boundary .  @xcite the parity breaking occurs as long as the boundary deviates from the infinite mass confinement toward the zigzag edge .",
    "this is due to the structural sublattice asymmetry : a zigzag - type crystal face has unequal numbers of sites from the two sublattices of the honeycomb structure .",
    "@xcite more generally , the parity in this continuum model can can not be preserved simultaneously with the time - reversal invariance near the edge of the system .",
    "this is closely related to the existence of time - reversal symmetric , propagating edge states  @xcite which have become a topic of vigorous graphene - related research ( see , e.g. , refs .  , ) .",
    "the time - reversal symmetry requires that the edge states from the different valleys propagate in the opposite directions , forming a kramers pair at a given energy . as a result , even in the absence of the intervalley scattering the problem does not reduce to a single valley , in the sense that the valley contributions to observables are not identical . for the low - energy states ( imitating the rh and lh fermions ) , this implies broken dirac fermion parity .",
    "we intend to demonstrate several new properties of the broken - parity edge states :    * ( i ) * nonanalytic particle - hole asymmetry of local and global densities of states ,    * ( ii ) * time - reversal invariant pseudospin polarization ( which in graphene is associated with the sublattice degree of freedom ) , and    * ( iii ) * asymmetric nonlinear bias - voltage dependence of the tunneling conductance .",
    "our finding * ( i ) * can be tested by means of scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) of the density of states ( dos ) .",
    "in fact , some sts experiments  @xcite have already reported a particle - hole asymmetric dos with a peak at -20 - 50 mev for monoatomic zigzag graphene edges .",
    "by contrast li et al .",
    "@xcite have observed a symmetric linear dos in graphene bulk . in our model ,",
    "the crossover from an asymmetric edge dos to a symmetric bulk one follows naturally from the existence of the broken - parity dirac fermion edge states .",
    "the results of experiments  @xcite could therefore provide some evidence for the dirac fermion parity violation . such an interpretation is also supported by the observation that the position of the dos peak in the experiment of niimi et al .",
    "@xcite can be described very accurately by our model .",
    "this is achieved by taking into account not only the structural asymmetry but also a potential - energy difference between the sublattices  @xcite that generates weakly dispersive edge states rather than the singular zero - energy band .",
    "@xcite it was shown earlier  @xcite that the next - nearest - neighbor hopping on the honeycomb lattice could also result in a particle - hole asymmetric edge dos . however , this symmetry - breaking mechanism results in the dos peak at significantly larger energies , of the order of next - nearest - neighbor hopping energy @xmath1 mev .",
    "another our result * ( ii ) * demonstrates that broken - parity edge states carry a time - reversal - invariant pseudospin polarization .",
    "this agrees with the general perception that in graphene electronic properties and those arising from the sublattice degree of freedom ( pseudospin ) are interrelated .",
    "however , there is a great deal of uncertainty as to how such a relation can be studied .",
    "the specific feature of our edge problem is that it is possible to establish a one - to - one correspondence between the pseudospin polarization and the edge dos .",
    "we suggest that the pseudospin polarization can be detected via measurements of the electric conductance in lateral tunnel contacts between zigzag - terminated graphene and a suitably chosen metallic electrode .    our proposal is based on finding * ( iii ) * that the edge - state ( i.e. polarization - dependent ) contribution to the conductance is asymmetric with respect to the bias voltage .",
    "therefore , it can be separated from the symmetric contribution of the bulk graphene states .",
    "in addition , the edge - state tunnel conductance turns out to be strongly nonlinear : it exhibits kink - like switching as the sign of the voltage reverses .",
    "such a behavior could serve as a prototype for the potentially useful electronic functionality .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we formulate the boundary problem for the green s function of the dirac equation and discuss the role of the parity symmetry . in sec .",

    "the last section  [ discussion ] summarizes our results and discusses their validity as well as possible applications .",
    "edge - state spectroscopy usually deals with isolated edges in large samples where finite - size effects are presumably irrelevant .",

    "@xcite in graphene , where @xmath17 label the valleys , the case of the zigzag edge corresponds to  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the out - of - plane unit vector .",
    "this implies that one of the sublattice green s functions must vanish at the edge , reflecting the structural sublattice asymmetry of the zigzag boundary .",
    "@xcite the other nontrivial limit is @xmath24 it is the infinite mass confinement of berry and mondragon  @xcite ( @xmath25 is the unit vector along the edge ) . as shown in ref .  ,",
    "the intermediate case , when @xmath26 interpolate between ( [ z ] ) and ( [ mc ] ) , can be treated as a zigzag edge where the _ structural _ sublattice asymmetry coexists with a _ potential _ ( energy ) sublattice asymmetry that could result from electron - electron interactions within atomic distances near the edge .",
    "@xcite this does not however exhaust the applicability of the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) , since it can be derived from the only requirement that the dirac particle current is zero in the normal direction at the edge .",
    "@xcite    unless restricted to the infinite mass confinement case ( [ mc ] ) , the boundary parameters are not identical , @xmath27 , which is verified below on the basis of the time - reversal ( @xmath28 ) symmetry [ see , eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , boundary condition  ( [ bc ] ) ( and , in particular , eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) ) explicitly contains the chirality , @xmath10 .",
    "this violates the symmetry under the exchange of the rh and lh quasiparticles , @xmath29 since it reverses the sign of @xmath10 ( in contrast , @xmath11 is even under such operation ) . on the other hand",
    ", the rh @xmath0 lh exchange is involved in the parity transformation ,  @xcite @xmath30 and in the particle - hole conjugation , @xmath31 both leaving the dirac equation ( [ eq ] ) invariant .",

    "( [ p3 ] ) , no particle - hole symmetry . the symmetry breaking persists in the limit of the zigzag edge , eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the parity breaking is due to the structural sublattice asymmetry of the zigzag - type lattice termination .",
    "@xcite for practical calculations , we need to take into account deviations of @xmath32 from @xmath23 ( e.g. due to potential - energy sublattice asymmetry  @xcite ) , because it eliminates the green s function singularity at @xmath33 characteristic to dispersionless zero - energy edge states .",

    "this imposes the following restrictions on @xmath45 : @xmath46 leaving a single free boundary parameter - the direction of the unit vector @xmath47 .",
    "the edge - state spectrum is now manifestly kramers degenerate and particle - hole asymmetric :  @xcite @xmath48 the role of the parity breaking is quite apparent from the behavior of the edge - state green s function  ( [ g3_1 ] ) : it vanishes identically for the infinite mass confinement ( @xmath49 ) which preserves the parity symmetry ( see , also eq .  ( [ mc ] ) ) .",

    "we will see that in addition to the exponentially localized states ( [ g3_1 ] ) there is another type of edge states decaying algebraically as a consequence of the lack of the energy gap in the 2d bulk .",

    "<S> the parity breaking reflects the structural sublattice asymmetry of zigzag - type edges and is closely related to the previously predicted time - reversal symmetric edge states . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the local and global densities of the edge states and show that they carry a specific polarization , resembling , to some extent , that of spin - polarized materials . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of the parity leads to a nonanalytical particle - hole asymmetry in the edge - state properties . </S>",
    "<S> we use our findings to interpret recently observed tunneling spectra in zigzag - terminated graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose a graphene - based tunneling device where the particle - hole asymmetric edge states result in a strongly nonlinear conductance - voltage characteristics , which could be used to manipulate the tunneling transport . </S>"
