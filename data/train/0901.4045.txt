    "although many authors relate the dominance of the kl mechanism to a large @xmath13 component in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons and to the proximity of the @xmath13 threshold to the scalar meson mass , in fact the kl mechanism is a feature of the chiral dynamics and reflects the important role of the pseudoscalar mesons in low- and intermediate - energy interactions .",

    "@xcite based on the short - distance constraints on the flavor - changing @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 scalar form - factors it was shown that the values of @xmath22 and @xmath21 couplings in the @xmath90 resonance chiral lagrangian satisfy the relation [ eq : jamin ] c_m = c_d = 46.2 .",
    "this relation , in particular , allows us to reduce the number of adjustable parameters in the fit .",
    "the expression for the invariant mass distribution in the kl model is obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , and its physical meaning is explained in terms of the @xmath91 and @xmath92 couplings  @xcite .",

    "the mass of the @xmath2 and the mixing angle @xmath46 turn out to be strongly correlated in the fit .",
    "the masses of the scalar resonances obtained from the fit with the propagator ( [ scalar - propagator ] ) are overestimated .",
    "we observe that the account for the real part of the scalar - meson self energy , even in a simple flatt - like approximation , results in a considerable decrease of the @xmath42 mass in the fit . therefore there is a strong motivation for the careful treatment of the self - energy and the effects related to a specific behavior of the scalar meson spectral function .",
    "the importance of these aspects is discussed also in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "usually the experimental results are interpreted in terms of the constant values of the @xmath91 couplings @xmath104 instead of @xmath105 functions .",

    "an importance of the derivative - coupling interactions was emphasized in ref .  @xcite some time ago , and recently discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the replacement of @xmath105 functions by the constant values may have a dramatic influence on the invariant mass distributions .",
    "in fact , in these distributions @xmath37 varies within the wide region  from the @xmath107 threshold up to the @xmath12 mass squared  and the scalar resonances may `` feel '' the variation of @xmath105 along the spectrum . this becomes more manifest in the case of a broad @xmath108 meson , which is sometimes included in the fit .",
    "we fit the @xmath3 and @xmath109 spectra by varying only the masses of scalar mesons and the singlet - octet mixing angle @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath101 meson is not included yet .",
    "it is interesting that the strict constraint @xmath110  mev  @xcite still leaves a possibility to fit the data with a reasonably small @xmath111 . at the same time",
    "one realizes that the subtraction of a rather nontrivial non - scalar resonance contributions may be very important for a study of scalar resonance features .",
    "although our fit gives somewhat overestimated values for the mass of @xmath2 scalar resonance , there may be a way out .",
    "an inclusion of the self - energy in the scalar meson propagator in an advanced form may result in the mass lowering .",
    "the dominant scalar resonance contribution of fig.[fig : e+e - scalar - scheme ] exhibits just a part of the @xmath112 and @xmath113 mechanisms .",
    "the other contributions , which interfere with the scalar meson contribution , are in general complicated . for example , in the case of the neutral particles in the final state there are @xmath114 , @xmath115 ,  @xmath116 and other processes .",
    "such non - scalar resonance channels and background are important for the precise analysis of the data ( see , for example , ref .",
    "these contributions can also be included in framework of with a relatively few number of free parameters .",
    "the approach can be extended to a wide interval of the @xmath5 center - of - mass energy , covering not only the @xmath12 resonance  @xcite .",
    "the model allows for an extension to the charged particles production in @xmath5 annihilation .",
    "in addition to the @xmath12 decays , the framework is useful for a detailed study of other radiative decays involving the light scalar mesons . among the most interesting ones there are the radiative decays into vector mesons @xmath117 , @xmath118 , currently under study in jlich  @xcite .    to summarize ,",
    "the approach for the decays with scalar mesons at order @xmath119 is outlined .",
    "though it does not specify the internal structure of scalar mesons , the important features of these resonances are reproduced .",
    "the model allows to investigate a complicated interplay of kaon loop mechanism , scalar - meson mixing and momentum dependence of the effective couplings in the invariant mass distributions .",
