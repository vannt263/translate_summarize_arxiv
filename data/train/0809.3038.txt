    "the charmed and bottomed baryons which contain a heavy quark and two light quarks are particularly interesting for studying dynamics of the light quarks in the presence of a heavy quark .",
    "they behave as the qcd analogue of the familiar hydrogen bounded by the electromagnetic interaction , and serve as an excellent ground for testing predictions of the constituent quark models and heavy quark symmetry @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks form an @xmath10 flavor triplet , @xmath11 , two light quarks can form diquarks of a symmetric sextet and an antisymmetric antitriplet . for the @xmath12-wave baryons ,",
    "the sextet contains both spin-@xmath13 and spin-@xmath14 states , while the antitriplet contains only spin-@xmath13 states .",
    "there have been many theoretical approaches dealing with the heavy baryons with one heavy quark , for example , the relativized potential quark model @xcite , the feynman - hellmann theorem and semi - empirical mass formulas @xcite , the faddeev equation @xcite , the combined expansion in @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite , the lattice simulations @xcite , the relativistic quark - diquark approximation @xcite , the hyperfine interactions @xcite , the qcd sum rules in the heavy quark effective field theory @xcite , the variational approach @xcite , and the full qcd sum rules @xcite , etc .",
    "the @xmath17 antitriplet states ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and the @xmath17 and @xmath20 sextet states ( @xmath21 ) and ( @xmath22 ) have been established ; while the corresponding bottomed baryons are far from complete , only the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 have been observed @xcite .",
    "recently the d0 collaboration reported the observation of the doubly strange baryon @xmath27 in the decay channel @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) in @xmath31 collisions at @xmath32 tev @xcite .",
    "the experimental value @xmath33 is about @xmath34 larger than the existing theoretical calculations @xcite , while the theoretical prediction @xmath35 @xcite is consistent with the experimental data @xmath36 @xcite .    in previous work ,",
    "we have calculated the masses and the pole residues of the @xmath37 heavy baryons @xmath38 and @xmath39 with the qcd sum rules @xcite",
    ". in this article , we extend our previous work to study the corresponding @xmath0 heavy baryons @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    in ref.@xcite , the masses of the heavy baryons @xmath40 and",
    "@xmath41 are studied in the full qcd sum rules with the same interpolating current as the present work .",
    "the authors choose the tensor structure @xmath42 and obtain different spectral density . and @xmath41 in the full qcd sum rules with the same interpolating current @xmath43 @xcite . ]",
    "the masses of the @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 have been calculated with the full qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the masses of the @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 have been calculated with the qcd sum rules in the leading order of the heavy quark effective theory @xcite , and later the @xmath15 corrections were studied @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the masses of the orbitally excited heavy baryons with the leading order approximation @xcite and the @xmath15 corrections @xcite in the heavy quark effective theory have also been analyzed .",
    "recently the @xmath0 and @xmath37 bottomed baryons were studied with the qcd sum rules in the heavy quark effective theory including the @xmath15 corrections @xcite .    in the qcd sum rules ,",
    "the operator product expansion is used to expand the time - ordered currents into a series of quark and gluon condensates which parameterize the long distance properties of the qcd vacuum .",
    "based on the quark - hadron duality , we can obtain copious information about the hadronic parameters at the phenomenological side @xcite .    the article is arranged as follows : we derive the qcd sum rules for the masses and the pole residues of the @xmath40 and @xmath41 in section 2 ; in section 3 numerical results are given and discussed , and section 4 is reserved for conclusion .",
    "in the following , we write down the two - point correlation functions @xmath50 in the qcd sum rules approach , @xmath51 where the upper index @xmath52 represents the @xmath53 and @xmath54 quarks respectively , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are color indexes , @xmath58 is the charge conjunction matrix , the @xmath59 and @xmath60 stand for the dirac spin vector and the pole residue of the heavy baryon @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "the correlation functions @xmath50 can be decomposed as follows : @xmath62 due to lorentz covariance .",
    "the first structure @xmath42 has an odd number of @xmath63-matrices and conserves chirality , the second structure @xmath64 has an even number of @xmath63-matrices and violate chirality . in the original qcd sum rules analysis of the nucleon masses and magnetic moments @xcite , the interval of dimensions ( of the condensates ) for the odd structure is larger than the interval of dimensions for the even structure , one may expect a better accuracy of the results obtained from the sum rules with the odd structure .    in this article , we choose the two tensor structures to study the masses and the pole residues of the heavy baryons @xmath40 and @xmath41 , as the masses of the heavy quarks break the chiral symmetry explicitly .",
    "the components @xmath65 with the odd structure have smaller dimension of mass than the components @xmath66 with the even structure , naively we expect the components @xmath65 have better convergent behavior in the operator product expansion , and the numerical results confirm this conjecture , see tables 1 - 2 .",
    "we insert a complete set of intermediate baryon states with the same quantum numbers as the current operators @xmath67 into the correlation functions @xmath68 to obtain the hadronic representation @xcite . after isolating the pole terms of the lowest states @xmath61 , we obtain the following result : @xmath69    in the following , we briefly outline the operator product expansion for the correlation functions @xmath50 in perturbative qcd .",
    "the calculations are performed at large space - like momentum region @xmath70 , which corresponds to small distance @xmath71 required by validity of the operator product expansion .",
    "we write down the `` full '' propagators @xmath72 and @xmath73 of a massive quark in the presence of the vacuum condensates firstly @xcite , @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 , then contract the quark fields in the correlation functions @xmath50 with wick theorem , and obtain the result : @xmath77\\gamma_5 \\gamma_\\mu s_q^{kk'}(x)\\gamma_\\nu \\gamma_5\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substitute the full @xmath9 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 quark propagators into above correlation functions and complete the integral in the coordinate space , then integrate over the variable @xmath57 , we can obtain the correlation functions @xmath78 at the level of quark - gluon degree of freedom .",
    "once analytical results are obtained , then we can take the quark - hadron duality and perform borel transform with respect to the variable @xmath79 , finally we obtain the following two sum rules with respect to the tensor structures @xmath42 and @xmath64 respectively : @xmath80    @xmath81    where @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "we carry out the operator product expansion to the vacuum condensates adding up to dimension-6 and calculate the same feynman diagrams as in the sum rules for the @xmath37 heavy baryons @xcite ( where the two tensor structures @xmath85 and @xmath86 are chosen ) , the contribution from each of the feynman diagrams differs from the corresponding one in our previous work .    in calculation ,",
    "we take assumption of vacuum saturation for the high dimension vacuum condensates , they are always factorized to lower condensates with vacuum saturation in the qcd sum rules , factorization works well in large @xmath87 limit . in this article",
    ", we take into account the contributions from the quark condensates @xmath88 , @xmath89 , mixed condensate @xmath90 , gluon condensate @xmath91 , and neglect the contributions from other high dimension condensates , which are suppressed by large denominators and would not play significant roles .",
    "differentiate the above sum rules with respect to the variable @xmath92 , then eliminate the pole residue @xmath93 , we obtain two qcd sum rules for the masses @xmath94 with respect to the tensor structures @xmath42 and @xmath64 , respectively .    in the heavy quark limit @xmath95",
    ", the quarks @xmath53 and @xmath54 degenerate , we replace the heavy quark field @xmath96 in the baryon current @xmath43 with the effective field @xmath97 to obtain the interpolating current @xmath98 in the heavy quark effective theory , which differs from the corresponding one constructed from the heavy quark effective theory remarkably and does not warrant the tensor structure @xmath99 @xcite .    in the heavy quark limit , the correlation function @xmath100 ( with @xmath101 )",

    "the calculations of the operator product expansion can be performed in the coordinate space and are greatly facilitated , as we do not need the mixed picture both in coordinate and momentum spaces .",
    "we calculate the same feynman diagrams as in the full qcd , the contributions of some diagrams vanish in the heavy quark limit .",
    "finally we obtain two sum rules with respect to the tensor structures @xmath109 and @xmath64 respectively : @xmath110 where we have used the definitions for the binding energy @xmath111 and the pole residue @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , the @xmath115 is the dirac spin vector in the heavy quark limit .",
