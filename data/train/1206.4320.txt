    "[ figs - band - nosoc](c ) one clearly sees that here , too , the system remains gapless in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "thus for both os / graphene and ( cu - os)/graphene the gaps indeed originate solely from spin - orbit interactions .      in the main text we remarked that cu and os co - adsorbates energetically prefer to form vertical dimers over the h - site in graphene . here",

    "the vertical dimer in ( a ) is nonmagnetic ( with or without spin - orbit coupling ) , whereas the other configurations are magnetic .",
    "finally , we briefly highlight our results for ir adatoms on graphene .",
    "we found that ir slightly prefers the h site over the bridge site , the binding energy being 2.17 ev in the former configuration and 2.12 ev in the latter .",

    "figure [ figs - ir - band](d ) shows that restoring spin - orbit coupling introduces a huge band gap @xmath69 ev below the fermi level ( green dashed line ) .",
    "moreover , in fig .",
    "[ figs - ir - band](c ) we see that this gap results from hybridization between the ir @xmath6 orbitals and graphene s @xmath48 bands , similar to os / graphene and the tight - binding model described in the main text .",
    "spin - orbit interactions also , however , produce small spin and orbital moments for ir given respectively by 0.30 @xmath56 and 0.13 @xmath56 ; these are responsible for the weak band splittings in fig .",

    "[ figs - ir - coverage ] . as in all other cases studied here ,",

    "observing a true topological insulator phase in ir / graphene is complicated by the magnetic moments predicted by dft and the fact that the fermi level resides in the conduction band .",

    "furthermore , it may be feasible to gate the system back to the insulating regime by conventional means at low coverages . ) in the main text we described how co - doping with cu eliminates both potential challenges . here",
    "we simply wish to note that cu - ir dimers carry yet another advantage ",
    "they strongly enhance binding to the h - site compared to isolated ir adatoms , similar to the os case .",
    "indeed , the binding energy for cu - ir dimers over the h - site is larger by 0.62 ev and 0.79 ev compared to the bridge and top sites , respectively . by contrast the differences for pure ir are only 0.05 ev and 0.23 ev as we saw above ."

    "<S> reference @xcite revived graphene as a viable topological insulator candidate by predicting that dilute concentrations of heavy in or tl adatoms dramatically enhance the gap to detectable values of order 0.01 ev . essentially , these adatoms mediate enhanced spin - orbit interactions of the type present in the kane - mele model @xcite for pure graphene .    </S>",
    "<S> our approach here also relies on hybridizing graphene with dilute heavy adatoms , though the underlying physics is entirely different and can not be understood in terms of an effective graphene - only model . </S>",
    "<S> rather , we will show using density functional theory that certain adatoms  specifically os , ir , cu - os dimers , and cu - ir dimers  form spin - orbit - split impurity bands that hybridize with graphene s dirac states in such a way that a highly robust topological insulator regime emerges . </S>",
    "<S> in fact here it is more appropriate to view the adatoms as the dominant low - energy degrees of freedom , with _ their _ coupling effectively mediated by graphene ; from this perspective this mechanism represents the inverse of that invoked in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> numerous practical advantages arise in this scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the topological insulator gaps are extremely large  typically exceeding 0.2 ev  and take on nearly the full _ atomic _ spin - orbit splitting for the adatoms . </S>",
    "<S> such values reflect more than an order - of - magnitude enhancement compared to the gaps induced by in or tl , and are competitive with the largest gap predicted for any topological insulator . </S>",
    "<S> somewhat counterintuitively , these gaps are remarkably insensitive to the adatom concentration , taking on comparable values at least over coverages ranging from @xmath1% . in the case of os adatoms and cu - ir dimers </S>",
    "<S> , the fermi level also naturally resides within the topological insulator band gap . </S>",
    "<S> this eliminates perhaps the most serious challenge with in and tl , both of which substantially electron - dope graphene even at quite low coverages . </S>",
    "<S> these features suggest that the observation of a topological insulator state in graphene may be within reach .    </S>",
    "<S> we first elucidate the mechanism uncovered here using a tight - binding model that exposes the physics in a very transparent manner . consider @xmath2 adatoms residing at positions @xmath3 located at ` hollow ' ( h ) sites in graphene as in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> it is convenient to define vectors @xmath20 that point from an adatom to the six surrounding carbon sites [ see fig .  [ bandstructurefig](a ) ] . </S>",

    "<S> the gapless excitations at zero momentum exhibit the following two crucial properties : @xmath32 they arise from _ weakly perturbed adatom orbitals _ since at the zone center the nearest carbon bands reside well over 1 ev away in energy , and @xmath33 they are protected by time - reversal , spatial rotation , and su(2 ) spin symmetries that coexist when @xmath34 . breaking the last of these symmetries by turning on spin - orbit coupling </S>",

    "<S> the gap opening indeed drives the system into a topological insulator phase . </S>",
    "<S> since our hamiltonian is inversion symmetric this can be readily verified by computing fu and kane s formula for the @xmath36 invariant in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> [ edgestatefig](b ) illustrates the dos for the random case , again at 6.25% coverage . even in our finite system </S>",

    "<S> next we demonstrate using density functional theory ( dft ) that the mechanism described above can be realized in graphene with 5@xmath0 adatoms , notably os and ir . </S>",
    "<S> all dft calculations were carried out with the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite at the level of the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite , including spin - orbit coupling unless specified otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> positions of all atoms were fully relaxed using the conjugated gradient method for energy minimization until the calculated force on each atom became smaller than 0.01 ev /  . </S>",
    "<S> most results were obtained using the supercell in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bandstructurefig](a ) , with one adatom per cell . for additional details see . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath41-grid mesh @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energy cutoff of the plane wave expansion was set to 500 ev . ] below we report our results for os and then turn to ir .    </S>",
    "<S> since the thermal stability of adsorption structures is relevant for both experiments and applications , candidate adatoms should ideally exhibit large h - site binding energies [ defined as @xmath42 and high diffusion energy barriers [ defined as @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> osmium satisfies both criteria . </S>",
    "<S> the binding energy for os at the h site in graphene is 2.42 ev  much larger than the ` top ' ( directly above a c ) and ` bridge ' ( above the midpoint of a c - c bond ) configurations for which @xmath44 is 1.70 and 1.59 ev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the calculated diffusion barrier for an os adatom to diffuse from an h site through the top site is found to equal the difference between the binding energies at these positions , 0.72 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the barrier for diffusion through the bridge site is similarly given by 0.83 ev . </S>",
    "<S> therefore os adatoms should be stable over h sites even at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast most 3@xmath0 transition metals have @xmath45 ev @xcite and are much more mobile @xcite ; for example , the diffusion barrier is only 0.40 ev for co on graphene @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ bands](a ) displays the dft band structure for periodic h - site os adatoms on graphene at 6.25% coverage using the @xmath24 supercell in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bandstructurefig](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> each os adatom forms a charge state of @xmath46 ( based on the bader charge division scheme @xcite ) , indicating that the os - graphene bonds mix covalent and ionic features . </S>",
    "<S> clearly these bonds dramatically modify the characteristic dirac bands at the @xmath31 point of pure graphene similar to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bandstructurefig ] . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , os induces a large band gap @xmath47 ev , _ right at the fermi level _ given by the green dashed line in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> bands](a ) . as in our tight - binding model </S>",
    "<S> the gap here results solely from spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> ( without spin - orbit interactions a gapless spectrum arises ; see the supplemental material . ) more precisely , the partial density of states ( pdos ) for the os @xmath2 orbitals displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bands](b ) indicates that the gap arises from the hybridization between graphene s @xmath48 states and the spin - orbit - split @xmath4 and @xmath5 adatom orbitals , also as in our tight - binding model . </S>",
    "<S> the pdos for the @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 orbitals , by contrast , is concentrated at much lower energies . </S>",
    "<S> thus the gap - opening mechanism introduced earlier indeed appears in the realistic os / graphene system .    </S>",
    "<S> the os - induced gap depends exceptionally weakly on coverage . </S>",
    "<S> to illustrate this important point we performed simulations of graphene with one os adatom in @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 supercells ( corresponding to coverages of 4% , 2.04% , and 1% ) . </S>",
    "<S> circles in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bands](c ) show the dft - predicted gaps , which remain close to 0.2 ev even at 1% coverage . </S>",
    "<S> this striking feature is actually rather natural since the local atomic spin - orbit splitting for the os @xmath4 and @xmath5 orbitals essentially sets @xmath55 .    strictly speaking </S>",
    "<S> , a true topological insulator phase does not arise in the dft simulations described above since os forms small spin and orbital magnetic moments of 0.45 @xmath56 and 0.05 @xmath56 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this produces visible splittings of the bands at the @xmath57 and m points corresponding to time - reversal - invariant momenta ; see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bands](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> one should keep in mind , however , that dft can sometimes overestimate moment formation . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , even if a moment @xmath58 indeed appears in an experiment , there are practical means by which this can be quenched to zero to reveal a bona fide topological phase . </S>",
    "<S> one effective approach is to apply an external electric field @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ modifying](a ) illustrates that @xmath58 of os on graphene depends sensitively on @xmath59 . in particular @xmath60 transfers additional </S>",
    "<S> charge from os to graphene and kills the moment for @xmath61 v /  . the electric fields required to restore time - reversal symmetry only weakly affect the band structure . </S>",
    "<S> see , for example , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ modifying](b ) corresponding to 6.25% os coverage with @xmath62 v /  , where a time - reversal - invariant topological insulator appears with a gap @xmath63 ev .    </S>",
    "<S> co - doping provides another means to quench the os magnetic moment . to preserve the main features of the band structure while attracting charge away from os ( as accomplished by a negative @xmath59 ) , co - adsorbates should interact weakly with graphene and exhibit larger electronegativity than os . following this guidance , we considered cu , ag , and au in several configurations as described in the supplemental material . </S>",
    "<S> whereas os repels ag and au adatoms , cu prefers to climb over os to form a vertical cu - os dimer over the h site . </S>",
    "<S> the binding energy @xmath64 for these dimers is 5.96 ev , higher by 2.50 ev compared to that of well - separated cu and os adatoms . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , cu more strongly anchors os to the h site since the binding energy for the vertical dimers over the top ( bridge ) site is weaker by 1.27 ( 1.42 ) ev . </S>",
    "<S> this is not the only relevant criterion , however , since in practice isolated cu and os adatoms must be able to dimerize without overcoming substantial energy barriers . </S>",
    "<S> we explored this issue by computing the total energies along the diffusion path depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ modifying](c ) , where a cu adatom beginning at position d ends up above an os at position a. figure [ modifying](d ) illustrates the change in energy @xmath65 relative to the dimer state for various positions along this trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> the energy barrier for a cu adatom to diffuse from location d to b is only @xmath66 ev ; once at position b the cu strongly attracts to the top of os and forms the vertical dimer.(d ) . ] </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that dimer formation ought to proceed quite efficiently .    </S>",
    "<S> because of the hybridization and charge transfer between the cu and os atoms  the bader charges of cu and os are respectively @xmath67 and @xmath68dft predicts that graphene with cu - os dimers is nonmagnetic . the spectrum for ( cu - os)/graphene at 6.25% coverage again supports a large topological insulator gap @xmath69 ev as evident in the band structure of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ modifying](e ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the triangles in fig .  [ bands](c ) show that this gap exhibits similarly weak coverage dependence as for os / graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the drawback here , however , is that the fermi level [ green line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ modifying](e ) ] now resides in the valence band . </S>",
    "<S> returning the fermi level to the insulating regime should be possible with conventional gating techniques , provided one works at low coverage .    </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the hole introduced by each cu - os dimer can be compensated by replacing os with ir , which has one additional electron . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that vertical cu - ir dimers also strongly bind to the h - site in graphene without forming a magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> hybridization between cu - ir dimers and graphene produces nearly the same band structure as for ( cu - os)/graphene , but with the fermi level lying in the band gap . </S>",
    "<S> see the band structure for 6.25% cu - ir coverage in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ modifying](f ) , where the gap is @xmath70 ev . </S>",
    "<S> additional results for ir / graphene  which behaves similarly to os / graphene  can be found in the supplemental material .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced a mechanism by which graphene covered with heavy adatoms realizes a topological insulator protected by a giant gap comparable to atomic spin - orbit energies , even at exceptionally dilute coverages . </S>",
    "<S> using dft we predicted that os , ir , cu - os dimers , and cu - ir dimers all give rise to this mechanism and produce gaps exceeding 0.2 ev at coverages as low as 2% . </S>",
    "<S> although our dft calculations of necessity invoked periodic adatom configurations , our tight - binding simulations indicate that readily observable bulk ( mobility ) gaps should survive also in the random case relevant for experiments . </S>",
    "<S> these findings are expected to greatly facilitate the realization of a topological insulator phase in graphene - based systems . </S>",
    "<S> we suspect , however , that the mechanism exposed here has much broader applications since ( contrary to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) the physics has nothing to do with the kane - mele model specific to graphene . </S>",
    "<S> hybridizing trivial metals or insulators with heavy - element impurity bands may therefore provide a generic method for designing new topological phases , which would be interesting to investigate in future work . </S>"
