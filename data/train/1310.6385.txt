    "the reflectance r(@xmath8 ) of naoso@xmath0 is shown in fig . 1 in the 0 - 1000 @xmath9 frequency range .",
    "at 450 k it shows a metallic response , approaching unity at zero frequency . after crossing t@xmath4",
    "this metallic behavior depletes progressively and , in the antiferromagnetic insulating phase , two complex phononic structures start to appear as a consequence of the reduced screening . at 5 k",
    "there is a well visible double phonon peak with characteristic frequencies around 300 @xmath9 and 330 @xmath9 and another phonon resonance at 650 @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , r(@xmath8 ) shows a rising tail for @xmath10 related to a low - frequency mode centered around 20 @xmath9 ( see discussion below ) . in the inset of fig .",
    "1 we show instead the reflectance over the entire measured range in the metallic ( 450 k ) and in the insulating state ( 5 k ) .",
    "it is well evident that the mit determines a strong modification of the electronic properties of naoso@xmath0 over a frequency scale up to nearly 10000 @xmath9 .",
    "the main panel of fig .",
    "2 shows the optical conductivity @xmath11 on a linear scale in the 0 - 10000 @xmath9 frequency range as obtained from reflectance data by kramers - kronig relations .",
    "the same quantity is represented in the inset on a logarithmic scale for selected temperatures above and below t@xmath4 .",
    "the symbols on the vertical axis indicate the dc conductivity values calculated from resistivity data measured on samples coming from the same batch @xcite . at all temperatures there is a good agreement between the zero frequency limit of @xmath11 and the measured @xmath12 .",
    "the optical conductivity at 450 k shows a metallic behavior with a broad pseudo plasma - edge around 12000 @xmath9 which separates the low energy excitations from a huge interband transition around 20000 @xmath9 .",
    "this absorption band is mainly associated to charge - transfer excitations among os 5d and o 2p states @xcite .",
    "below t@xmath4 the metallic conductivity sharply decreases in the far - infrared through a transfer of spectral weight ( sw ) to a mid - infrared ( mir ) band centered around 3000 @xmath9 .",
    "the low - frequency sw depletion is nearly exhausted at 200 k where the mir is located at about 4000 @xmath9 .",
    "a broad feature centered around 22 @xmath9 can be seen in the insulating phase between 5 and 200 k and it is probably hidden at higher - t by the free carrier background .",
    "we associate this peak to an antiferromagnetic resonance .",
    "indeed , the insulating phase of naoso@xmath0 corresponds to a g - type af configuration @xcite where the spins are oriented along the _ c_-axis .",
    "the antiferromagnetic mode corresponds to a precession of spins along @xmath13 induced by some degree of magnetic anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the loss of sw in the far - infrared mirrors the opening of an optical gap e@xmath14 already distinguishable at 380 k , whose size increases for decreasing t. one can then extract e@xmath14 from data in fig . 2 and compare its temperature dependence with that expected for a second order ( slater ) phase transition .",
    "the optical conductivity in the insulating af phase can be described through the following equations :    @xmath15    and    @xmath16^\\alpha \\hspace{0.5cm}\\mbox{for}\\hspace{0.2 cm } \\omega\\geq e_g \\label{parabolic}\\ ] ]    here , the linear term describes the low - frequency background which is mainly due to thermally excited charge - carriers across the insulating gap ( see below ) . for higher frequencies instead",
    ", we assumed a behavior of @xmath11 similar to that of a semiconductor in the presence of direct band to band transitions @xcite .",
    "the resulting curves , reported as dashed lines in the inset of fig .",
    "3 , nicely fit the rising edge of @xmath11 at all temperatures with @xmath17 . an estimation of the gap e@xmath14 is then obtained through the intersection between eq .",
    "[ linear ] and eq .",
    "[ parabolic ] , and its temperature behavior , plotted as empty circles in fig .",
    "3 , resembles that of a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) function in good agreement with the second order character of the mit .",
    "let us mention that similar gap values can also be achieved by substituting the linear conductivity ( eq . [ linear ] ) with an overdamped drude term",
    ". therefore the error bars in fig .",
    "3 take into account the small variation of e@xmath14(t ) in terms of different extracting methods and the smearing effect in the conductivity edge due to the temperature .",
    "a bcs - like analytic expression for e@xmath18 can be written as @xcite :    @xmath19",
    "this function well describes data in fig .",
    "3 furnishing a value of e@xmath14(0)=825 @xmath20 25 @xmath9 and a t@xmath4=400 @xmath20 10 k in fair agreement with the value ( t@xmath4=410 k ) obtained through transport and magnetic measurements @xcite .",
    "moreover , e@xmath21/k@xmath22t@xmath4=3.0@xmath23 0.1 , thus suggesting a weak coupling regime in agreement with a slater scenario .    as mentioned before",
    ", the gap opening corresponds to a loss of sw in the infrared which is transferred to higher frequencies .",
    "the energy scale involved in this process can be estimated from fig .",
    "4 where the optical spectral weight is reported .",
    "it can be written as follows :    @xmath24    and it is proportional to the number of carriers taking part to the optical absorption up to a cutoff frequency @xmath25 .",
    "the sw is nearly conserved for @xmath2615000 @xmath9 .",
    "this energy scale is well captured by the lda+u calculation reproducing , for a g - type antiferromagnetic order , the insulating state for a moderate value of _ _ u__@xmath271 - 2 ev @xcite .",
    "the sw redistribution can be analyzed in detail by fitting @xmath11 through a multi - component drude - lorentz ( d - l ) model .",
    "the complex optical conductivity is written in terms of a drude contribution and five lorentzian curves as :    @xmath28    in the drude term @xmath29 is the plasma frequency , @xmath30 is the scattering time , while the lorentz oscillators are peaked at finite frequencies @xmath31 with strength @xmath32 and width @xmath33 .",
    "we used a lorentzian oscillator both for the mid - infrared band and for the charge - transfer transition around 20000 @xmath9 .",
    "the phonon absorption is described in terms of three lorentzian components .",
    "examples of d - l fits are represented in the main panel of fig . 2 both at 450 k ( metallic phase ) and 5 k ( insulating phase ) .",
    "from the fit we have extracted @xmath34 whose values vs. t are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "4 as open diamonds .",
    "one can observe a drastic collapse of @xmath34 at the mit .",
    "below t@xmath4 the residual drude weigth is mainly determined by the charge - carriers thermally excited above the insulating gap .",
    "indeed @xmath34 can be fitted by an exponential t - dependence @xmath35=@xmath36 ( red symbols ) with @xmath37 @xmath38 , nearly corresponding to the square of the plasma frequency at 410 k. by employing the gap values in fig .",
    "3 , this exponential equation properly reproduces the experimental points from 200 k , where the drude contribution is still zero , to 380 k where the gap is nearly closed .    even more importantly the plasma frequency at 450 k can be used for a quantitative determination of the degree of electronic correlation in naoso@xmath0 .",
    "indeed the drude plasma frequency is related to the experimental kinetic energy of mobile carriers by the relation @xmath39 .",
    "due to correlation effects this value is renormalized ( reduced ) with respect to the kinetic energy provided by local density approximation calculations @xmath40 @xcite . in a mott - hubbard insulator",
    "@xmath41=0 as charge - carriers are completely localized due to coulomb correlation , at variance with the band - structure results predicting a metallic response with a finite @xmath40 .",
    "conversely , for conventional metals like gold and copper , the ratio @xmath421 , indicating the scarce relevance of electronic correlations . from the drude - lorentz fit at 450 k shown in the main panel of fig .",
    "2 we estimate @xmath431.6 ev ; lda calculations provide @xmath44 ev instead . from these data",
    "we achieve a ratio @xmath420.6 , thus locating naoso@xmath0 at the border between correlated metals and uncorrelated systems suggesting a relatively weak electronic correlation .",
    "naoso@xmath0 shows a half - filled 5__d__@xmath7 electronic configuration . since 5__d _ _ orbitals are spatially more extended than those in 3__d _ _ and 4__d _ _ systems , theoretical calculations argue that electron - electron interactions should play a minor role in the low - energy electrodynamics suggesting a slater origin of the mit @xcite . in this paper",
    "we provide robust experimental evidence for the slater mechanism .",
    "indeed , the @xmath45 ratio , which has been demonstrated to well estimate the electronic correlation degree in many materials , gets a value @xmath420.6 .",
    "this firstly suggests that naoso@xmath0 lies near the band - like itinerant regime @xcite . secondly , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "3 , the gap develops in a continuous way in naoso@xmath0 , by following a bcs - like temperature dependence .",
    "conversely , in mott - hubbard materials as v@xmath2o@xmath0 , ni(s , se)@xmath2 and ndnio@xmath0 , a gap abruptly appears while crossing t@xmath4@xcite .",
    "moreover , both the e@xmath21/k@xmath22t@xmath4=3.0 @xmath20 0.1 ratio and the gap temperature dependence are in good agreement with the second order character of a slater mit .",
    "finally , the concomitance of the mit with the af ordering , as measured through neutron scattering , suggests that magnetism is the main cause for the mit .",
    "all these findings clarify the mit in terms of the slater mechanism , showing that naoso@xmath0 is the first known 3d slater insulator .",
    "a high - density polycrystalline pellet sample of naoso@xmath0 was synthesized starting from na@xmath2o@xmath2 and oso@xmath2 powders through a high pressure technique ( see ref . ) . a powder x - ray diffraction study using cu @xmath46 radiation confirmed the absence of impurities .    * optical measurement .",
    "* we performed near - normal reflectance measurements on an accurately polished sample using a michelson interferometer in the frequency range from 10 @xmath9 ( this limit varies for some temperatures ) to 15000 @xmath9 .",
    "terahertz and subterahertz ( @xmath4750 @xmath9 ) measurements were performed using radiation produced at the sissi @xcite and iris @xcite infrared beamlines at elettra and bessy - ii synchrotrons respectively .",
    "a gold or silver ( depending on the spectral range ) coating was evaporated _ in situ _ over the sample surface and used as a reference .",
    "the optical conductivity was calculated by kramers - kronig transformations .",
    "low - frequency reflectance data were extrapolated with standard methods ( hagen - rubens or constant lines ) taking into account the resistivity dc values measured in samples of the same batch .",
    "a high - frequency tail @xcite was instead merged to the data above 15000 @xmath9",
    ".    * lda calculation . *",
    "the @xmath40 was obtained from first - principles calculations within local density approximation ( lda ) of density functional theory .",
    "the electronic structure was calculated from full - potential augmented plane wave ( apw ) methods with the wien2k package @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction was included within self - consistent calculations .",
    "the lattice constants and atomic positions were taken from experimental values @xcite .",
    "the muffin - tin radii were chosen as 2.0 , 1.8 and 1.7 a.u . for na , os , and o , respectively .",
    "the cutoff wave number k in interstitial region was set to rk = 8 , where r is the smallest atomic radius , i. e. , 1.7 a.u . for o.",
    "the integration over brillouin zone was performed by a tetrahedron method with up to 1960 k - points in an irreducible zone . the optical conductivity and plasma frequency were estimated from the momentum matrix elements as described in ref . .",
    "since naoso@xmath0 has orthorhombic symmetry with _ pnma _ space group , the optical conductivity tensors are characterized by three diagonal elements @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
