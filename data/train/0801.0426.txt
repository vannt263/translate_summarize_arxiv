    "with the advances in acoustic communication technology , the interest in study and experimental deployment of underwater networks has been growing @xcite .",
    "however , underwater acoustic channels impose many constraints that affect the design of wireless networks .",
    "they are characterized by a path loss that depends on both the transmission distance and the signal frequency , a feature that distinguishes an underwater acoustic system from a terrestrial radio system .",
    "thus , not only the power consumption , but also the useful bandwidth depend on the transmission distance @xcite .    from an information theoretic perspective , both the distance between two nodes and the required capacity determine the power consumption for that link and the optimal transmission band .",
    "it is thus of interest to have a simple , closed - form expression that relates the transmission power to the desired capacity .",
    "this would enable an efficient design of both point to point links and underwater networks , eventually leading to a minimum cost overall network optimization .",
    "thus , these expressions may be useful from both a theoretic and an engineering standpoint .    in this paper ,",
    "simple closed - form approximations for the power consumption and operating frequency band as functions of distance and capacity are presented .",
    "this approximate model stems from an information theoretic analysis that takes into account a physical model of acoustic propagation loss , and colored gaussian ambient noise .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the transmission power as a function of the distance could be well approximated by @xmath0 .",
    "a similar relationship was shown to exist for the operating bandwidth .",
    "the coefficients in this model were determined as functions of the required signal to noise ratio .",
    "the present work extends this idea of modeling the power and bandwidth as functions of distance , but the problem is cast into a slightly different framework .",
    "namely , instead of using the snr as a constraint , i.e. a fixed design parameter , the desired link capacity is used as a figure of merit . in few words",
    ", this work proposes approximate models for the parameters as functions of the capacity .",
    "this resulting model is useful for a broad range of capacities and distances .",

    "is outlined . in section 3 , a brief description of the numerical evaluation procedure is described . in section 4 ,",
