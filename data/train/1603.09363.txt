    "the filtered signal @xmath5 is used as a control signal for vco .",
    "the equations describing the model of pll - based circuits in the signals space are difficult for the study , since that equations are nonautonomous ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , the equations of model in the signal s phase space are autonomous @xcite , what simplifies the study of pll - based circuits .",
    "the application of averaging methods @xcite allows one to reduce the model of pll - based circuits in the signals space to the model in the signal s phase space ( see , e.g. , @xcite .        the main difference between the physical model ( fig .  [ ris : pllsigspace ] ) and the simplified mathematical model in the signal s phase space ( fig .",
    "[ ris : pll_pf_space ] ) is the absence of high - frequency component of the phase detector output .",
    "the output of the phase detector in the signal s phase space is called a phase detector characteristic and has the form @xmath6 the maximum absolute value of pd output @xmath7 is called a phase detector gain ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the periodic function",
    "@xmath8 depends on difference @xmath9 ( which is called a phase error and denoted by @xmath10 ) .",
    "the pd characteristic depends on the design of pll - based circuit and the signal waveforms @xmath11 of input and @xmath12 of vco",
    ". for pll with impulse signals the pd characteristic is as follows ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath13    let us describe a model of classical pll with impulse signals in the signal s phase space ( see fig .",
    "[ ris : pll_pf_space ] ) .",
    "a reference oscillator and a voltage - controlled oscillator generate the phases @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the frequency of reference signal usually assumed to be constant : @xmath16    the phases @xmath14 and @xmath15 enter the inputs of the phase detector .",
    "the output of phase detector is processed by filter .",
    "further we consider the active pi filter ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) with transfer function @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the considered filter can be described as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the filter state .",
    "the output of filter @xmath22 is used as a control signal for vco : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the vco free - running frequency and @xmath25 is the vco gain .",
    "relations ( [ eq : input ] ) , ( [ eq : filterorig ] ) , and ( [ eq : vco ] ) result in autonomous system of differential equations @xmath26 denote the difference of the reference frequency and the vco free - running frequency @xmath27 by @xmath28 . by the linear transformation @xmath29 we have @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the loop gain . here ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) describes the model of pll with the impulse signals and active pi filter in the signal s phase space .    by the transformation",
    "@xmath32 ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) with odd pd characteristic ( [ eq : pdchartriangle ] ) is not changed .",
    "this property allows one to use the concept of frequency deviation @xmath33 and consider ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) with @xmath34 only .",
    "the pll state for which the vco frequency is adjusted to the reference frequency of input is called a locked state .",
    "the locked states of the pll correspond to the locally asymptotically stable equilibria of ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) , which can be found from the relations @xmath35    since ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) is @xmath36-periodic in @xmath37 , we can consider ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) in a @xmath36-interval of @xmath37 , @xmath38 $ ] . in interval",
    "@xmath38 $ ] there exist two equilibria : @xmath39 as is shown below ( see [ sec : applockin ] ) the equilibria @xmath40 are locally asymptotically stable . hence , the locked states of ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) are given by equilibria @xmath41 .",
    "the remaining equilibria @xmath42 are saddle equilibria ( see [ sec : applockin ] ) .",
    "the model of classical pll with impulse signals and active pi filter in the signal s phase space is globally asymptotically stable ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the pll achieves locked state for any initial vco phase @xmath2 and filter state @xmath4 .",
    "so , there exist no limit cycles of the first kind , heteroclinic trajectories , and limit cycles of the second kind on the phase plane of ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) ( see fig .",
    "[ ris : cyclesphaseplane ] ) .    ) . ]",
    "however , the phase error @xmath37 may significantly increase during the acquisition process . in order to consider the property of the model to synchronize without undesired growth of the phase error @xmath37 , a lock - in range concept",
    "was introduced in @xcite : `` _ if , for some reason , the frequency difference between input and vco is less than the loop bandwidth , the loop will lock up almost instantaneously without slipping cycles . the maximum frequency difference for which this fast acquisition is possible",
    "is called the lock - in frequency _ '' .",
    "the lock - in range concept is widely used in engineering literature on the pll - based circuits study ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is said that a cycle slipping occurs if ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath43        however , in general , even for zero frequency deviation ( @xmath44 ) and a sufficiently large initial state of filter ( @xmath4 ) , cycle slipping may take place , thus in 1979 gardner wrote : _ `` there is no natural way to define exactly any unique lock - in frequency '' _ and _",
    "`` despite its vague reality , lock - in range is a useful concept '' _ @xcite .    to overcome the stated problem , in @xcite the rigorous mathematical definition of a lock - in range",
    "is suggested :    @xcite _ the lock - in range of model ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) is a range @xmath45 such that for each frequency deviation @xmath46 the model ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) is globally asymptotically stable and the following domain @xmath47 contains all corresponding equilibria @xmath48 [ def : lockin ] _    for model ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) each lock - in domain from intersection @xmath49 is bounded by the separatrices of saddle equilibria @xmath50 and vertical lines @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the behavior of separatrices on the phase plane is the key to the lock - in range study ( see fig .",

    "consider an approach to the lock - in range computation of ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) , based on the phase plane analysis . to compute the lock - in range of ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) we need to consider the behavior of the lower separatrix @xmath52 , which tends to the saddle point @xmath53 as @xmath54 ( by the symmetry of the lower and the upper half - planes , the consideration of the upper separatrix is also possible ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 shifts the phase plane vertically . to check this",
    ", we use a linear transformation @xmath55 .",
    "thus , to compute the lock - in range of ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) , we need to find @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 is called a lock - in frequency ) such that ( see fig .
