    "the foundational claim of the metamaterial research community is the ability to engineer artificial materials with deliberate electromagnetic responses . however , despite considerable developments in the metamaterial field over the last 10 plus years , the question of how to quantify the electromagnetic response of a metamaterial is still very much an open one . the electromagnetic response of any material is quantified by the so called constitutive parameters of the materials ( permittivity , permeability , etc . )",
    "the determination of these constitutive parameters in the long wavelength limit is the subject of this paper .",
    "one of the earliest attempts to assign values to the constitutive parameters of a metamaterial was the method sometimes referred to as as s - parameter retrieval  @xcite .",
    "this method lacks generality in that it assumes that the metamaterial in question is isotropic and has no electromagneto coupling , though it is recognized that it can be used to characterize anisotropic materials with diagonal constitutive tensors .",
    "it has since been generalized to accommodate bi - anisotropic metamaterials obeying certain symmetry requirements  @xcite as well as reciprocal bi - isotropic ( isotropic chiral ) metamaterials  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there have been many other modifications of the original s - parameter retrieval method which are less useful , either because they are trivial or because they use the retrieval method in ways that are inappropriate considering the assumptions the original method is based on .",
    "in addition to the fact that s - parameter retrieval is only applicable to highly symmetric metamaterials , it should also be noted that this method assumes no spatial dispersion in the material it is applied to .",
    "this simplification affects many other assumptions implicit in the retrieval method regarding the symmetry of the constitutive parameters and the boundary conditions of the material , limiting the validity of the s - parameter retrieval method , as well as introducing apparently non - physical characteristics to the retrieved constitutive parameters due to the presence of spatial dispersion  @xcite . despite these limitations , s - parameter retrieval is today the most widely used method for assigning values to the constitutive parameters of metamaterials .",
    "in addition to s - parameter retrieval , there have been several attempts at developing a more general homogenization theory for metamaterials  @xcite .",
    "there has been limited success with these methods but none can be considered a general theory for metamaterial homogenization .",
    "one trait that all of these methods have in common is that none of them are related to the classical method of homogenization known as asymptotic homogenization .",
    "asymptotic homogenization , sometimes referred to as classical homogenization , is a old and established method for homogenizing differential equations that is limited to the long wavelength limit . for an introduction to the asymptotic homogenization method",
    "see refs .  .",
    "the fact that asymptotic homogenization only works in the long wavelength limit is the main reason that it has been largely ignored by the metamaterial theory community .",
    "many of the more interesting metamaterial phenomenon , negative index of refraction for example , involve resonances which difficult to characterize using asymptotic homogenization . however , one advantage of asymptotic homogenization is that it can characterize very asymmetric and therefore anisotropic materials , something many other homogenization procedures can not do .",
    "there have been a number of attempts to apply this method to metamaterials  @xcite .",
    "in addition there is a similar homogenization method that involves placing a metamaterial between two metal plates and calculating the macroscopic permittivity by treating the metamaterial as a capacitor  @xcite .",
    "this method is less general than asymptotic homogenization in that it requires certain symmetries in the metamaterial to be performed correctly .",
    "however , within this limitation the method is mathematically equivalent to asymptotic homogenization . in this paper",
    "we apply the asymptotic theory of homogenization to metamaterials with microscopically bianisotropic inclusions .",
    "our use of the method is distinguished from many of the previously mentioned references in that we work with potential fields , as opposed to the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the normal implementation of asymptotic homogenization method is typically applied to a potential field .",
    "one example of this is the homogenization of electrostatic permittivity tensors using the electrostatic potential .",
    "other examples include the homogenization of a stiffness tensor using the displacement vector as the potential field , the homogenization of thermal conductivity using the temperature as the potential field , and the homogenization of a permeability tensor using density as the potential field .",
    "our first implementation of the asymptotic homogenization will use the electromagnetic four - potential , consisting of the electrostatic scalar potential @xmath0 and the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath1 . following the standard method of asymptotic expansion , we assume that the four - potential can be represented as an expansion in terms of the unitless small parameter @xmath2    @xmath3 \\textbf{a}^{\\alpha}(\\textbf{x } ) = & \\textbf{a}^0(\\textbf{x},\\textbf{y } ) + \\alpha \\textbf{a}^1(\\textbf{x},\\textbf{y } ) + \\alpha^2 \\textbf{a}^2(\\textbf{x},\\textbf{y } ) + \\cdots\\ . \\end{array}\\ ] ]    here @xmath4 is a vector coordinate describing the rapidly changing values of the four - potential inside the unit cell and",
