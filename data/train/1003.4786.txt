    "we have considered the @xmath6-zgnr that has @xmath6 units of the c - c pair in the @xmath7-direction per unit cell and repeats along the @xmath8-axis with the periodicity of 2.46  .",
    "the unit cell of the pvdf also repeats along the @xmath8-axis , but with a different equilibrium unit cell length of 2.54    which is 3.15% longer than that of the zgnr ( figure 1a ) . for convenience ,",
    "the unit cell size of the pvdf is set to be reduced in the @xmath8-direction so that it matches the length of the zgnr ( 2.46  ) in studying the joint system ( figure 1b , c ) .",
    "the unit cell in this system is indicated in figure 1c .",
    "we confirm that our atomic models with the slightly compressed pvdf on the zgnr give essentially the same results as the ones obtained from a fully relaxed geometry ( without compression ) in a very large commensurate unit - cell for the pvdf and the zgnr .",
    "we will discuss this issue later .",
    "the vacuum along the @xmath7-axis is set to be longer than 70    in order to avoid the spurious dipole interactions between the adjacent pvdfs in repeated supercells .",
    "all properties remain the same when the supercell size is doubled , and the dipole correction is negligible for our purpose . in determining the most stable position of the pvdf on the zgnr , three parameters have to be optimized simultaneously : directions of the dipole moment of the pvdf , heights of the pvdf from the zgnr plane , and distances between the pvdf and the edge of the zgnr along the @xmath7-axis . from a combinatorial search ,",
    "the structure is found to be stabilized when the dipole orientation is parallel to the surface of the zgnr , the height of the lowest atom of the pvdf from the zgnr is 2.5  , and the pvdf lies on the middle position of the zgnr ( figure 1b , c ) .    from theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite studies , the dipole orientation of the pvdf is known to depend highly on the kind of substrate .",
    "when the substrate is a conductor , the image dipole is induced by the dipole of the pvdf on conducting substrates and the interaction energy between two dipoles should be taken into account .",
    "if we regard the pvdf as a single dipole , the energy of perpendicular dipoles is @xmath9 from the dipole - dipole interaction energy equation  @xcite , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the magnitude of the dipole moment and the distance between the dipole of the pvdf and its image dipole , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy of parallel dipoles is @xmath12 .",
    "thus , on the conducting substrate , the perpendicular dipole direction of the pvdf is energetically favored  @xcite . on the contrary , in the case of an insulating or semiconducting substrate , for example , kbr  @xcite or kcl  @xcite , the dipole is aligned parallel to the surface plane because the image dipole is negligible  @xcite . from the calculations , we find that the pvdf favors lying flat to the zgnr plane since the zgnr is semiconducting with its low screening capability .    the distance from the zgnr to the lowest atom of the pvdf",
    "is found to be 2.5  , and it is 3.5    from the zgnr to the c - c bond of the pvdf ( figure 1b ) . from the fully relaxed geometries , we can infer that the pvdf weakly binds to the zgnr and the pvdf affects the electronic structure of the zgnr not through chemical bonding between the pvdf and the zgnr , but through the electronic potential induced by the strong dipole moment .",
    "the structure shown in figure 1c , where the c - c bonds of the pvdf and those of the zgnr cross each other at the middle of the zgnr , has been found to a ground state . even if the pvdf deviates its ground state geometry slightly , we find that no essential variation occurs in the electronic structures due to the weak bonding between the pvdf and the zgnr .",
    "it is also noticeable that , with the pvdf , the antiferromagnetic spin configuration of the zgnr is still more stable than the ferromagnetic one . for a single pvdf on the 8-zgnr , the interedge antiferromagnetic ordering",
    "is more stable by 2.1 mev per edge atom .",
    "the isosurface of the charge density difference between the up - spin and the down - spin ( @xmath1 ) in this case is presented in figure 1d .",
    "now , we analyze the band structure of this joint system , a single pvdf on the 8-zgnr .",
    "the pristine 8-zgnr shows a small band gap of 0.3 ev for both spins . with one pvdf deposited on the 8-zgnr , the band structure of the zgnr",
    "is changed as if it were under external transverse electric fields  @xcite ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the electric potential energy is raised at the fluorine side and lowered at the hydrogen side of the pvdf .",
    "since the dipole field decays slowly in space , the potential drop induced by this dipole field takes place over a large area which can cover both edges of the zgnr .",
    "the energy eigenvalues of the zgnr are also modified by this potential variation so that the band gap of the , say , up - spin state is reduced to 0.18 ev , and that of the down - spin state is increased up to 0.41 ev ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we can estimate the potential profile generated by a single pvdf chain on the zgnr by averaging the potential energies in the @xmath8-axis with the position of the zgnr fixed in @xmath13 direction .",
    "its drop across two edges of the pvdf is 1.2 v and that of the 8-zgnr is 0.8 v. according to previous works  @xcite , such a band gap change corresponds to the case of homogeneous electric field of 0.05 v /    applied to the 8-zgnr , that is , the total potential difference between two edges of the 8-zgnr is 0.89 v ( = 0.05 v /    @xmath14 17.85  , where 17.85    is the length of the 8-zgnr ) , which agrees reasonably well with the present calculation of 0.8 ev .",
    "thus , the change of the bandgap mainly originates from the potential difference between two edges of the zgnr .",
    "when the electric field is applied , the energy eigenvalues of the states localized on the left side of zgnrs are pulled up , and those on the right side are pushed down  @xcite .",
    "then , the energy gap of the up - spin state decreases , and that of the down - spin increases . we conclude that the energy eigenvalues of zgnrs are modified because of interplay between the antiferromagnetic interedge ordering and the dipole field of the pvdf .    .",
    "( they overlap in most places . )",
    "the inset displays the band structure in the range of @xmath15 @xmath16 100 mev and @xmath17 . in all figures , the fermi level ( @xmath18 )",
    "is set to zero . ]    before proceeding further , we check the lattice mismatch problem between the pvdf and the zgnr in the unit cell .",
    "as we mentioned before , the lattice of the pvdf is reduced to that of the zgnr in the @xmath8-axis . to verify the effect of the compressed pvdf on the zgnr",
    ", same calculations are performed for a large supercell amounting to 32 unit - cells of the zgnr and 31 unit - cells of the pvdf , in which the bonds experience almost no strain . very little change of the band structure is observed with a different width of the pvdf along the periodic direction .",
    "hence , the role of the pvdf is only to generate the electric field by its dipole moment , and the position of the pvdf or the reduced cell size does not appreciably influence the electronic and magnetic properties of the system .",
    "in addition , a typical domain size of the ferroelectric thin film of the pvdf is around 200 nm so that , if considering a nanoscale channel device geometry , the effect of phase changes along the pvdf would not be serious in the present case .",
    "@xcite    next , we increase the number of pvdfs deposited on the 8-zgnr one by one ( figure 2 ) .",
    "dipole moments of pvdfs are all aligned in the same direction .",
    "the total dipole moment of pvdfs is increased , and the potential drop across the zgnr becomes 1.26 , 2.0 , and 3.0 v if the number of pvdfs is 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively , in the 8-zgnr case .",
    "( the local potential drop between two edges of pvdfs increases to 2.1 , 3.4 , and 5.0 v as increasing the number of pvdfs . ) the band gap of the up - spin state is decreased while that of the down - spin state increases as the number of pvdfs increase .",
    "eventually , if four pvdfs are coated on the 8-zgnr , the system turns to a half - metal .",
    "the up - spin states cross the fermi level while the down - spin states still have a band gap of 0.37 ev .",
    "four pvdfs generate enough of a potential difference ( 3.0 ev ) between two edges of the zgnr to give rise to the half - metallicity of the zgnr .",
    "with low defect concentrations at the edges , the half - metallic nature of zgnrs is already shown to be robust under the applied external transverse electric field in the previous work .",
    "@xcite since pvdfs here play the same role as do external fields in ref 11 , we note that the induced half - metallicity of the zgnrs will occur as long as weak edge defects or imperfections do not alter the magnetic ordering at the edges .",
    "( red ) denotes the direct bandgap of the up - spin , and @xmath19(blue ) the gap of the down - spin as a function of the coverage of pvdfs for the 8-zgnr ( filled circles ) , 12-zgnr ( open circles ) , and 16-zgnr ( squres ) .",
    "when the coverage reaches @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the width of the zgnr in angstrom , the zgnr becomes half - metallic . ]",
    "our calculations indicate that four pvdfs create a potential drop of 3.0 v across the @xmath6-zgnr irrespective of the width ( @xmath6 value ) of zgnrs ( for @xmath6 @xmath22 8 , tested up to @xmath6 = 32 ) .",
    "the @xmath6-zgnr becomes half - metallic when the potential drop across the system generated by pvdfs reaches 3.0 v , which has been suggested to be the critical value for half - metallicity in the previous work  @xcite . in terms of the percentage coverage ( _ i.e. _ ,",
    "the area of covered pvdfs divided by the area of the zgnr ) , the critical value for the transition to half - metal can be calculated by the width of four pvdfs ( 16.0  ) divided by the width of the zgnr ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is in angstrom ) .",
    "this can be regarded as a scaling behavior in the pvdf coverage and the width of zgnrs as follows , similar to the previous study on scaling in the strength of transverse electric fields and the width of the zgnr  @xcite ( figure 3 ) .",
    "finally , another advantage of our proposal compared with others lies in the fact that the half - metallic state can return to the insulating state by changing of the dipole orientation of pvdfs .",
    "if the dipole direction of pvdfs is set perpendicular to the zgnr plane by a perpendicular external electric field as in the usual experiments with back gates , then the potential drop across the zgnr vanishes and the half - metallicity disappears as well .",
    "we have calculated variations of the total energy by rotating a single pvdf on zgnrs .",
    "we have found that , without a perpendicular electric field , the perpendicular dipole direction of the pvdf to the zgnr is also at the local energy minimum ( or quasi - stable configuration ) , 30 mev higher than the ground state ( the parallel dipole direction ) . upon application of perpendicular electric fields ,",
    "the energy differences between parallel and perpendicular dipole configurations are decreased and eventually , with an electric field of @xmath230.07 v /  , the perpendicular dipole direction becomes the ground state .",
    "an energy barrier for @xmath24 rotation of the pvdf on the zgnr , that is , parallel to perpendicular direction change , is 96 mev per unit cell without an electric field and decreases to @xmath2377 mev with an electric field of 0.07 v /  .",
    "therefore , it is practically possible to switch between half - metallic and insulating states by applying a perpendicular gate field greater than 0.07 v /  .",
    "we have proposed a method to construct the half - metallic zgnrs by depositing the ferroelectric material pvdfs on them .",
    "the pvdfs generate the electrostatic potential on the zgnr because of their strong dipole moments . when the number of pvdfs coated on zgnrs increases beyond a critical value , the system becomes be half - metallic .",
    "the dipole direction of pvdfs is changeable by an external electric field , and switching between half - metallic and insulating states in zgnrs is made possible .",
    "we performed the first - principle calculations based on the density - functional theory ( dft ) within the local spin density approximation ( lsda )  @xcite and spin polarized general gradient approximation ( gga ) with the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) functional  @xcite , respectively , by using the siesta package  @xcite .",
    "the standard norm - conserving troullier - martins pseudopotentials  @xcite were employed , and split - valence double-@xmath25 plus polarization basis  @xcite was used .",
    "we have chosen a 400 ry energy cutoff for a real space mesh size and 96 @xmath26-points , uniformly distributed in the 1d brillouin zone .",
    "all edges were saturated with hydrogen atoms and relaxed by conjugate gradient minimization until the maximum force was less than 0.04 ev /  . to overcome an intrinsic error due to the pseudoatomic orbital basis set in the weakly binding system , the basis set superposition error ( bsse )",
    "was corrected using a counterpoise procedure  @xcite . in calculations with the pbe functional",
    ", we added a pairwise interatomic @xmath27 term ( @xmath28 ) to the pbe - dft energy in order to include the van der waals ( vdw ) interaction  @xcite . to obtain accurate vdw energies , the effective @xmath29 coefficients of each atom in the systems",

    "the comprehensive methods and comparisons are in the supporting information .",
