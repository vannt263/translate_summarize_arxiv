    "the most extraordinary phenomenon of wave transport in random media is anderson localization@xcite , which is shared by various systems , such as , electronic , photonic and accoustic systems@xcite . in anderson localized system",
    "the ensemble average of logarithmic transmission @xmath0 , not transmission @xmath1 , is additive with system length @xmath2@xcite .",
    "naturally , the localization length can be defined as @xmath3 . in strongly localized systems(@xmath4 ) , the transmission is generally small , but also shows large fluctuations@xcite .",
    "those extreme large @xmath5 values will dominate the transmission of localized systems . in the past years",
    ", the study of the physical origins of those large @xmath5 values yielded abundant results for understanding the transport phenomena in random systems and the anderson localization@xcite .",
    "previously , it was pointed out by m. a. azbel et al.@xcite that the resonant transport through those localized states lying near the system center can contribute very large @xmath5 values , being of order unity .",
    "although such a mechanism can generate high resonant transmission peak @xcite , its contribution to the transmission is vanishingly small in strongly localized system because the resonant peak is exponentially sharp ( @xmath6)@xcite . laterly , pendry@xcite and tartakovskii@xcite independently predicted a kind of quasi - extended state , called the _ necklace state(ns)_. the ns is formed through the coupling between nearly - degenerated localized states which are evenly distributed in the system . despite the spatial overlaps between localized states are small , _ because of the degenerate coupling _ , the ns contributes very wide transmission `` mini - bands '' , which can dominate the transmission of strongly localized systems .",
    "the nss have been demonstrated experimentally in photonic systems@xcite .",
    "their fundamental characters and statistical consequences to the transmission are widely studied@xcite .",
    "recently , it is demonstrated that the nss have evident contribution to the short - time transport of wave package@xcite and the dynamics of fluctuations of localized waves@xcite .",
    "more profoundly , the number of ns can increase dramatically as approaching the anderson transition point , which strongly supports a modes - coupling induced quantum percolation scenario for the anderson localization - delocalization transition@xcite .",
    "even though nss can contribute very large transmission , their formation has rigorous conditions , i.e. , the nearly - degenerated localized states are required to be _ evenly distributed _ inside the system@xcite . in general the localized states with similar frequency are not such well distributed in a specific random configuration . in such cases , _ _ ideal nss__@xcite crossing the whole configuration are not formed . but eventually , those nearly - degenerated states which are also _ spatially close to each other _ couple together , forming short chains of coupled - localized - states embedded inside the configuration . since those coupled - localized - states have similar properties as the ns , we call them _ short necklace state_(sns)@xcite",
    ". the sns also manifests as high transmission plateau which has significant transmission contribution . in transmission",
    "spectra the sns is hardly to be distinguished from isolated localized states since the valley between coupled peaks seems very low .",
    "but it can be clearly identified from the logarithmic transmission spectra , for instance , see the coupled - peaks in fig.1 .",
    "because of the strong coupling between the neighboring localized states inside the sns , on top of the plateau there are sharp peaks and valleys , which correspond to un - smooth changes of the transmission phase between the coupled - peaks@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the nss , the snss have special properties@xcite that ( 1 ) the snss exist widely in every random configuration while the ns only occurs once in millions of random configurations with large length(@xmath4 ) ; ( 2 ) the plateau - width of the snss only depends on the coupling strength between the neighboring localized states and is insensitive to the system length . with these properties ,",
    "snss are superior _ qualitatively _ compared with the nss .",
    "however , how to _ quantitatively _ characterize statistical properties and scaling behaviors of snss are still unexplored topic .",
    "even more , some essential quantities of sns study , such as the  half - width \" of sns plateaus in @xmath7 spectra , need to be defined since there is no obvious physical quantity in previous studies can directly describe sns .    in this paper",
    ", we study the statistical manifestation of the sns using physical quantities which are defined in the _ logarithmic _ transmission spectra .",
    "to characterize sns , we find out two different approaches , whose results can be compared with each other .",
    "the first approach is based on the correlation functions @xmath8 ( defined in the @xmath7 spectra ) and @xmath9 ( defined in the transmission coefficient @xmath10 spectra ) .",
    "from @xmath8 , we show that there is a typical frequency correlation range of logarithmic transmission , which is explained as the typical sns plateau - width . from this frequency range and compared with the results of @xmath9 , we can find the most - probable order of sns .",
    "the second approach is from the direct measurement of peak / plateau - width in @xmath7 spectra .",
    "we find the statistical distribution of peak / plateau - width is quite abnormal and can be fitted very well by the summation of two gaussian distribution functions , where the primary gaussian center gives the typical width of resonant peaks of localized states while the secondary one gives exactly the typical width of the sns plateaus .",
    "excellent agreements are found between two approaches .",
    "the dependencies of sns s properties on the scaling parameter @xmath11 are also studied .",
    "we find the plateau - width of sns almost does not depend on @xmath11 while the peak - width of localized states decays exponentially with @xmath11 , indicating the snss have more significant transmission contribution in longer systems .",
    "the essential quantities defined in this work also provide new ways for further quantitative study on statistical properties of the transmission of anderson localized systems .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce our model and basic properties of the @xmath7 spectra . in section iii , we present our numerical results and theoretical analysis of three correlation functions : the correlation of transmission @xmath12 , the correlation of logarithmic transmission @xmath8 and the field correlation @xmath9 . we show that the half - width of @xmath8 gives the typical plateau - width of sns .",
    "the most - probable order of sns can be obtained by comparing @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in section iv , we study statistical distributions of the peak / plateau - width ( defined in the @xmath7 spectra ) .",
    "the probability distributions are calculated from very large numbers of samples and can be fitted very well by the summation of two gaussian distributions , where the first gaussian center gives the typical width of resonant peaks of localized states and the second one gives the typical width of the sns plateau . in section v , we discuss the system length dependency of the sns . finally ,",
    "a summary of this work is given in section vi .",
    "we study 1d random stacks composed of binary - dielectric layers(called a and b ) with thicknesses @xmath13 and with refractive indices @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a random number uniformly distributed in @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath18 gives the randomness strength .",
    "such a periodic on average model is an optical counterpart of the anderson model of electronic systems and is widely used for localization studies@xcite .",
    "the transmission coefficients of optical waves are calculated by standard transfer matrix method@xcite . without randomness , @xmath19 ,",
    "the system exhibits a pass band in frequency range @xmath20 .",
    "our study will focus on the range @xmath21 , where the localization length is almost a constant for a certain randomness @xmath18(@xmath22)@xcite .",
    "the localization length is calculated by @xmath3 , where @xmath0 is averaged from the @xmath23 configurations satisfying @xmath4 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "fig.1(a ) shows two typical logarithmic transmission spectra with the same @xmath25 but with different localization lengths , @xmath26(black thin ) and @xmath27(red bold ) .",
    "we can see they have similar average height , being approximately @xmath28 .",
    "after averaged over a large number of configurations , the @xmath7 spectrum becomes a flat line exactly falls on the mean value @xmath29 .",
    "this is a natural result according to the single parameter scaling theorem that @xmath7 follows the gaussian distribution with mean value @xmath30 .",
    "an interesting phenomenon in the @xmath7 spectra is that there are some clear plateau - structures , such as the one marked by arrows in fig.1(a ) . from the wave intensity distributions one can find those plateaus",
    "are formed by the snss(i.e .",
    ", from the degenerate coupling between some spatially close localized states ) embedded inside the configuration@xcite .",
    "since the peaks of localized states in the spectra are extremely sharp ( @xmath31 ) , the fluctuation of @xmath7 is dominated by those plateaus .",
    "more importantly , these sns may be essential for understanding the anderson transition phenomenon@xcite .",
    "after observed a large number of @xmath7 spectra for fixed @xmath32 and @xmath11 , we find the plateaus appear with some intuitionistic regularities , ( 1 ) most plateaus have similar frequency width for a configuration ; ( 2 ) the number of peaks on each plateau are similar .",
    "for example , for most plateaus of the @xmath27 system shown in fig.1 , the plateau width is about @xmath33 and the number of peaks are about @xmath34 . in the following",
    "we will focus on the statistical properties of these snss and try to characterize them quantitatively .    to quantitatively study the sns , we need to find proper physical quantities .",
    "fig.1 shows that the plateaus of snss can hardly be distinguished from localized states in a @xmath5 spectrum ( see fig.1(b ) ) , but can be clearly identified by the plateaus in the @xmath7 spectra ( fig.1(a ) ) .",
    "so we try to define physical quantities in the @xmath7 spectra for the sns study . in the following",
    ", we will define and study the correlation function of @xmath7 spectra in our first approach .",
    "then , we will define the @xmath7 peak / plateau width@xmath35 and study the statistical distribution of @xmath35 in our second approach .",
    "according to the standard definition of mathematics , we define the correlation functions of @xmath5 and @xmath7 in frequency domain as : @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath5 is the transmission coefficient , @xmath38 is the standard deviation @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the covariance @xmath41 . physically @xmath12 implicates the frequency correlation of transmitted wave intensity .",
    "its fourier transformation corresponds to the dynamical response at the outgoing interface , which have been intensively studied in weakly localized systems@xcite . if two frequencies are on the same transmission peak , @xmath12 is close to unity .",
    "otherwise @xmath12 will close to zero .",
    "hence the half - width of @xmath12 is usually used to characterize the linewidth of localized states@xcite .",
    "similarly , on the @xmath7 spectra , since @xmath7 of two frequencies on the same plateau are much larger than the mean value @xmath0 and contribute a significantly large @xmath8 .",
    "we expect @xmath8 is close to unity when @xmath42 is smaller than a typical plateau - width and decays to zero when @xmath42 is larger than a typical plateau - width .",
    "meanwhile , we also study the field correlation function , @xmath43 where @xmath10 is complex transmission coefficient and @xmath44 .",
    "the complex amplitude of incident wave is chosen to be @xmath45 so that at the outgoing interface @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the complex electronic field and @xmath48 is its phase .",
    "similar to @xmath12 , the physical implication of @xmath9 is simply the frequency correlation of transmitted field , i.e. , the field correlation(@xmath12 is the intensity correlation ) .",
    "the definition of @xmath9 is the same as that in ref.@xcite , which could be negative valued , depending on the averaged phase difference @xmath49 between @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "generally , when @xmath42 crosses a resonant peak , the phase of @xmath10 jumps @xmath52@xcite .",
    "hence the phase difference between @xmath53 and @xmath54 is approximately @xmath55 . then latexmath:[$t_{\\omega}t_{\\omega+\\delta\\omega}^*+t_{\\omega}^*t_{\\omega+\\delta\\omega}=    negative and so that @xmath9 is negative .",
    "when @xmath42 gets to the value which typically contains two peaks ( plus one average distance between two peaks ) , @xmath9 will be positive since @xmath57 , and so forth .",
    "hence when increasing @xmath42 , we expect @xmath58 to oscillate between positive and negative .",
    "each time @xmath58 changes its sign , the average number of resonant peaks in @xmath42 increases one .",
    "so @xmath58 provides a way to check the average resonant peak number in a certain frequency range .    in our calculations we set the original frequency point @xmath59 without lose of generality .",
    "the correlation functions calculated from a very large number ( @xmath60 ) of configurations for different @xmath32 are shown in fig.2(a ) , where the ratio @xmath11 is fixed at @xmath61 .",
    "the solid , dashed and dotted curves respectively represents @xmath12 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "the red curves marked by crosses correspond to the smaller @xmath32 system and the black curves marked by solid dots correspond to the larger @xmath32 system . in fig.2(b ) the transverse axis is shown in logarithmic scale .",
    "let us first discuss @xmath12 .",
    "fig.2(a ) shows @xmath12 is a very singular function at the origin @xmath62 .",
    "the linewidth @xmath42 of localized states , corresponding to @xmath63 , is larger in the smaller @xmath32 systems .",
    "this is in consistent with the observation in fig.1 that the linewidth of resonant peaks in smaller @xmath32 system is larger .",
    "detailed data gives that the halfwidth of the larger @xmath32 system ( black solid curve ) is about @xmath64 and the smaller @xmath32 system ( red solid curve ) is @xmath65 .",
    "this is also quantitatively in consistent with the observation from the @xmath7 spectra .",
    "@xmath8 is a much smoother function than @xmath12 in the @xmath62 limit .",
    "take the @xmath66 system ( red curves ) for example .",
    "@xmath67 rapidly falls to zero near @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath8 exhibits a plateau at the origin , then drops to @xmath69 at @xmath70 , i.e. , its half - width is about @xmath71 , being much larger than that of @xmath12 .",
    "such contrast reflects the different geometry properties between the @xmath5 and @xmath7 spectrum . on the @xmath5 spectrum",
    ", @xmath12 falls to zero typically when two frequencies are not on the same peak .",
    "since the peaks of localized states are exponentially sharp , @xmath12 decreases rapidly as increasing @xmath42 .",
    "however , on the @xmath7 spectrum , there exist many plateaus formed by snss , as shown in fig.1(a ) .",
    "those plateaus are usually higher than the average transmission background @xmath0 .",
    "when two frequencies are on the same plateau but not the same peak , it will still contribute a significantly large value to @xmath8 .",
    "hence _ the halfwidth of @xmath8 , which is denoted as @xmath72 in this paper , approximately gives the typical plateau - width of sns in @xmath7 spectrum_.    with the help of @xmath9 , we can find more detailed information of sns , such as the average sns order , which is the average number of coupled localized states in one sns .",
    "similar to @xmath12 , @xmath9 also shows sharp singularity at the origin and falls quickly as increasing @xmath42 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath9 shows some oscillations around @xmath73 in the region where @xmath12 falls to nearly zero , see fig.2(c ) .",
    "as discussed earlier in this section , those oscillations can be understood from the @xmath52-phase jumps of resonant peaks of the localized states .",
    "the different order minimal / maximal points of the @xmath9 correspond to the frequency ranges which can accommodate certain number of resonant peaks .",
    "we denote the @xmath42 at the first minimum of @xmath9 as @xmath74 , which is the the typical frequency width of a resonant peak .",
    "we also denote @xmath75th order minimal / maximal points @xmath76 as the average frequency range which can accommodate @xmath75 resonant peaks .",
    "so @xmath9 is the ruler of the number of resonant peaks in a frequency range . with @xmath76 in our mind",
    ", we can see that the mean width of sns plateaus , obtained by @xmath8 , can accommodate about @xmath34 resonant peaks , as indicated by the green arrows in the fig.2(c ) .",
    "actually , this average number of resonant peaks in a sns agrees very well with our direct observation of many spectra .",
    "to make a test and verify of the characters of sns obtained from @xmath8 and @xmath9 , we next try our second approach , _",
    "i.e. _ direct measure of the peaks / plateaus - width in a large number of @xmath7 spectra . since the ensemble average of @xmath7 spectra@xmath0 is well defined , it is natural to _ define the peaks / plateaus - width @xmath35 as the frequency interval where @xmath7 is always higher than @xmath0_. from direct observation of the @xmath7 spectra , one can find that @xmath0 crosses lots of sharp peaks of localized states and fewer sns plateaus .",
    "more precise statistical results should be obtained from a large number of realizations .",
    "we find that the statistical distribution of @xmath35 is extremely skewed .",
    "the reason is that in anderson localized systems the peak - width of localized states is exponentially small and the width of coupled - peaks also scales exponentially with the system length@xcite .",
    "this is very similar to the probability distribution of the dimensionless conductance @xmath77 , which is extremely skewed ( nearly log - normal ) .",
    "early study@xcite on anderson localization has shown that it is better to study the additive quantity@xmath78 , which is nearly gaussian distributed .",
    "similarly , instead of @xmath35 , we will study the @xmath79 distribution , which is likely gaussian distributed .",
    "we have measured @xmath35 in @xmath80 spectra with high frequency precision that can distinguish each resonant peak in the @xmath81 systems@xcite .",
    "the probability distributions of @xmath79 for two different @xmath32 systems are shown in fig.3 .",
    "take the @xmath82 system as the example .",
    "( all the following discussions also apply to the @xmath26 system . )",
    "the probability distribution is roughly gaussian - like , where a clear maximum is found at @xmath83(@xmath84 ) .",
    "this is exactly the @xmath85 at first minimum of @xmath9 shown in fig.2 .",
    "as shown before , this value corresponds to the typical frequency range occupied by one single resonant peak .",
    "such a result is coincident with our direct observation of the @xmath7 spectra that the most probable peaks / plateaus crossed by @xmath0 are those single peaks .",
    "suppose the spectrum contains only sharp peaks but none plateaus .",
    "@xmath86 should be nearly gaussian distributed with a single maximum at the mean value .",
    "however , the real probability distribution of @xmath79 shows a strange shoulder at @xmath87(@xmath88 ) . comparing with fig.2 we find it exactly corresponds to the halfwidth of @xmath8 , @xmath72 , which is just the typical width of sns plateau , referring to the physical meaning of @xmath8 .",
    "actually , the measured probability distribution can be fitted very well by the summation of two gaussian distributions , as shown by the curves in fig.3 .",
    "the primary(left )",
    "gaussian center gives the width of single resonant peaks while the secondary(right ) one gives exactly the typical width of the sns plateau .",
    "such a strange probability distribution implies substantial sns plateaus with similar frequency widths contribute significantly to the probability distribution function of @xmath79 , resulting the characteristic shoulder of sns .",
    "it is first time to see directly from the statistical distribution that the sns is clearly distinguished from other localized states . from the distribution",
    ", we can see that the logarithmic plateau - width of sns is gaussian distributed and its mean value agrees excellently with the results of correlation functions in third section , as expected .",
    "so , both @xmath8 and the probability distribution of @xmath79 provides proper physical values for characterizing the sns .",
    "both the correlation functions and the probability distribution of @xmath79 suggest that the sns favors a specific frequency width and a specific number(order ) of localized states .",
    "but those studies are done with certain @xmath11 .",
    "next , to drive this conclusion further , we will calculate the correlation functions in the systems with different @xmath11 .",
    "fig.4(a ) shows @xmath9 ( the lower four blue curves ) and @xmath8 ( the upper four red curves ) functions for several @xmath11 values , where @xmath32 is fixed at @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) and @xmath91 from left to right .",
    "it clearly shows the peak width @xmath74 of resonant peaks of localized states ( marked by blue arrows ) decreases dramatically as increasing @xmath2 while the decrease of plateau - width @xmath72(halfwidth of @xmath8 marked by red arrows ) is much smaller .",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath72 versus @xmath11 are shown in fig.4(b ) and ( c ) .",
    "we can see @xmath74 decays exponentially with @xmath2 ( @xmath92 , as expected from traditional understanding@xcite .",
    "however , the decrease of @xmath72 is almost negligible and obviously much slower than @xmath74 .",
    "actually , the plateau - width of sns is determined by the intrinsic coupling strength(repulsing distance ) between localized states , which almost does not depend on @xmath2@xcite .",
    "such a distinction naturally results a picture that , as increasing @xmath2 more and more , the peaks of localized states become so sharp that they are almost undetectable , but the sns plateaus are still there . in our numerical statistics , the number(order ) of localized states increases nearly linearly with @xmath11 . in ref.@xcite",
    "it is further argued that those snss ( called intrinsic short necklace states ) have main contribution to the fluctuation of transmission and also affect the value of localization length .",
    "in summary , we have defined the basic quantities for sns study and investigate the statistical properties of sns in the strongly localized systems .",
    "we find two approaches to quantitatively study sns properties .",
    "the first approach is based on the correlation functions and the second one is based on direct measurements of the peak / plateau - width in logarithmic transmission spectra . in the first approach , we defined the correlation function @xmath8 in @xmath7 spectra and show that the typical width of sns plateaus can be characterized by the half - width of @xmath8 . and , with the help of @xmath93 ( correlation function of transmission coefficient @xmath10 ) , the most - probable order of sns can be obtained . in the second approach , we defined the peak / plateau - width @xmath35 in @xmath7 spectra and studied the probability distribution of @xmath94 directly measured from a large number of spectra .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath94 shows a novel shoulder and it can be fitted very well by the summation of two gaussian distributions .",
    "we showed that the first one is from the distribution of localized state peaks and the second one is from the plateaus of sns .",
    "the center of the second distribution gives the average frequency width of sns plateaus , which agrees very well with the value obtained from correlation function .",
    "as increasing the system length @xmath2 , the plateau - width of sns decays very slowly , compared with the exponentially - decayed peak - width of localized states .",
    "finally , we note that the methods we used in our paper is not limited to the transport properties of localized system .",
    "they may be used for studying other statistical quantities which have similar properties with the transmission of localized systems .",

    "note that each spectrum covers a wide frequency range , where a lot of peaks and plateaus will be cutted by @xmath0 .",
    "such that the ensemble of @xmath80 spectra is considerably large , with about @xmath95 sample peaks / plateaus ."
