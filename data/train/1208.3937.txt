    "inflation , a stage of accelerated expansion in the very early universe , is now widely accepted as part of the standard evolutionary scenario of the universe . on the other hand , many models of inflation have been proposed but we are still far from being able to narrow down the possible models sufficiently . among those many models of inflation ,",
    "much attention has been paid recently to the ones based on string theory  @xcite , which is considered to be a promising candidate for the ultimate unified theory . in particular , it is of great interest if the string theory landscape  @xcite , in which there are many local minima , or false vacua , and the universe jumps from one minimum to another by quantum tunneling , can be observationally tested  @xcite .",
    "quantum tunneling of a scalar field with gravity is usually treated with the coleman - de luccia ( cdl ) instanton method  @xcite , where the evolution of a scalar field is described with an o(4)-symmetric instanton , which is a solution of the euclidean equations of motion . motivated by the string landscape , inflation models with multi - scalar fields and/or with tunneling",
    "are now keenly studied .",
    "extension of the cdl instanton method to a multi - scalar field system is already discussed in @xcite . in those studies , however , many inflation models have been proposed , and now it is important to distinguish those models by observation .",
    "observations of the power spectrum of cmb temperature anisotropies have convinced us of the existence of an inflationary stage in the very early universe . on top of that , if a non - gaussian feature such as skewness or bispectrum is detected in the cmb anisotropy , it will have a strong impact on the physics of the early universe  @xcite .",
    "in particular , since any single - field slow - roll inflation model with canonical kinetic term predicts almost gaussian fluctuations  @xcite , any non - zero non - gaussianity will exclude all these models .",
    "observations of non - gaussianity use templates , such as local type  @xcite , equilateral type  @xcite , and orthogonal type  @xcite , in order to increase the statistical significance",
    ". however , since all of these templates assume statistical isotropy , there may be anisotropic non - gaussianities which may not have been detected by these templates . in this letter",
    ", we study a multi - field model in which a nonlinear interaction between two scalar fields , one of which being responsible for the curvature perturbation of the universe ( that is , for the formation of the large scale structure ) and the other for quantum tunneling via a cdl instanton , induces an anisotropic non - gaussianity . to be specific , we introduce an inflaton field @xmath2 that realizes slow - roll inflation , a tunneling field @xmath1 that governs the tunneling dynamics , and a curvaton field @xmath0 that contributes to the curvature perturbation of the universe  @xcite .",
    "the inflaton dominates the energy density of the universe during inflation but rapidly decays to radiation after the end of inflation , on the other hand , the energy density of the curvaton field is negligible during inflation but its decay is delayed after inflation so that it gradually begins to dominate the universe .",
    "approximating the universe during inflation by an exact de sitter spacetime , the inflaton behaves as a cosmic clock and determines an appropriate time - slicing , namely , a spatially flat time - slicing of the de sitter spacetime . in this setup , assuming that the energy scale associated with the tunneling field is much smaller than the energy scale of inflation , the bubble nucleation can be well described by a single - field cdl instanton with no backreaction to the geometry , that is , on the exact de sitter background  @xcite .",
    "the curvaton @xmath0 is affected by the background bubble through a coupling with the tunneling field @xmath1 . for simplicity and definiteness",
    ", we consider a potential of the form , @xmath3 . assuming that @xmath4 is non - vanishing only at or inside the bubble wall",
    ", we expect that @xmath0 may have a spatially localized , bubble - shaped non - gaussianity due to the background bubble - shaped configuration of @xmath1 .",
    "this leads to an anisotropic , bubble - shaped skewness of the cmb temperature anisotropy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first illustrate the background spacetime and the configuration of the bubble .",
    "next , we briefly review a useful formalism for computing the equal - time @xmath5-point functions , the tunneling in - in formalism , and calculate the skewness of the curvaton fluctuations .",
    "then we demonstrate that a sky map of an anisotropic non - gaussian parameter @xmath6 in our model .",
    "finally , we end with a few concluding remarks .",
    "let us start from a brief description of de sitter spacetime  @xcite .",
    "a lorentzian 4-dimensional de sitter spacetime is o(4,1)-symmetric , which is obtained by analytical continuation of an o(5)-symmetric 4-dimensional euclidean sphere , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : penrose_ds ] .        among various coordinatization of the spacetime ,",
    "the uniform tunneling field slicing is most appropriate to see o(4)(o(3,1))-symmetry of the cdl instanton , which corresponds to the time - slicing inside the bubble that describes a spatially homogeneous and isotropic open universe . for brevity ,",
    "let us call it open slicing .",
    "open slicing in the c - region in fig .",
    "[ fig : penrose_ds ] is a time - like slicing , an the metric in the c - region may be expressed as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the metric on the unit 2-sphere .",
    "theses coordinates can be extended to the other regions of the spacetime by analytical continuation : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the coordinates for the r- , l- , and e - regions , respectively , in fig .",
    "[ fig : penrose_ds ] .",
    "the metric for the flat time - slicing is @xmath15 as mentioned in the introduction , the @xmath16 slices are on which the inflaton is uniform , and give the cosmic rest frame of our universe .",
    "let us briefly describe the bubble configuration of @xmath1 under the thin - wall approximation .",
    "the o(4)-symmetric cdl instanton for @xmath1 can be described as a function of @xmath17 , which we denote by @xmath18 hereafter .",
    "we denote the wall radius by @xmath19 .",
    "hence @xmath20 though @xmath21 is homogeneous in the r- or l - regions , the physical bubble radius @xmath22 on flat slices increases as time goes on .",
    "we take the origin @xmath23 of the flat slicing metric ( [ flatslicing ] ) to be the center of the bubble at the time of nucleation .",
    "then the relations between the coordinates in the metrics  ( [ openslicing ] ) and ( [ flatslicing ] ) are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which gives @xmath26 .",
    "as seen from this expression , a bubble once nucleated with radius @xmath27 ( @xmath28 for @xmath29 ) expands to the hubble horizon scale within one or two @xmath30-folds of time , @xmath31 , and then expands comovingly as @xmath32 .",
    "it should be noted that models with multiple nucleation is possible .",
    "if those bubbles do not interact each other , we can take into account the effect of all bubbles by summing up the effect of each bubble .",
    "hereafter , we consider a model with a single bubble for simplicity .",
    "here we calculate the skewness in the curvaton fluctuations on the single bubble background .",
    "we consider the lagrangian for the curvaton @xmath0 as @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "we expand the above by setting @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a homogeneous classical part and @xmath37 is a quantum fluctuation .",
    "we assume that @xmath36 is approximately constant during inflation , and we concentrate on the evolution of @xmath37 .",
    "further , for simplicity , we assume @xmath38 is non - vanishing only on the wall . hence we approximate it as @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "then the lagrangian for @xmath37 is given as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is free - part and @xmath43 is interaction - part , @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "to calculate the quantum fluctuations on the instanton background , we extend the in - in formalism to euclidean spacetime , which we call the tunneling in - in formalism .",
    "this formalism is based on the wkb analysis of a tunneling wave function for free theory  @xcite to the case with nonlinear interactions .",
    "a detailed derivation will be given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the tunneling in - in formalism tells us that the @xmath5-point function of @xmath37 is given by @xmath46 where the tunneling in - in path @xmath47 and @xmath16 surfaces @xmath48 are as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : path_pen ] . the first half of @xmath47 ( the arrowed green line in fig .",
    "[ fig : path_pen ] ) goes from one end of the euclidean region to future infinity in the lorentzian region through the bubble nucleation surface . the second half of @xmath47 ( the arrowed blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : path_pen ] ) goes back from future infinity through the nucleation surface to the other end of the euclidean region .",
    "the slicing @xmath49 covers the whole euclidean region and the future half of the lorentzian region twice . in the lorentzian region",

    "the operator @xmath51 in eq .",
    "is the path - ordering operator . in the lorentzian region",
    ", @xmath51 reduces to the time - ordering and anti - time - ordering operators @xmath52 and @xmath53 on the first and second halves of @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that eq .",
    "is independent of the choice of coordinates .",
    "eq .   is evaluated in the same way as in the usual perturbation theory . after expanding the interaction part perturbatively ,",
    "operators are transformed to products of the free correlation function @xmath54 using wick s theorem .",
    "we note that @xmath55 is not the correlation function for the bunch - davies vacuum due to the non - trivial nature of @xmath42 .",
    "it may be obtained by studying the `` evolution '' of the mode functions in the euclidean space  @xcite .    while @xmath55 is a single - valued function when @xmath56 and @xmath57 are in space - like separation , when they are in time - like separation , @xmath52 or @xmath53 in the expression singles out the feynman or anti - feynman propagator , respectively .",
    "a branch of @xmath55 , when @xmath57 is in the euclidean region , is determined by analyticity on @xmath57 along @xmath47 .",
    "it may be noted that by this way of choosing branches the expression in eq .",
    "is equivalent to that obtained by analytical continuation of euclidean quantum field theory  @xcite , and o(4)(o(3,1 ) ) symmetry of the result is guaranteed .    , but with all domains of integration given in eq .  .",

    "in the following calculations , we approximate @xmath55 by that of the bunch - davies vacuum , by neglecting corrections due to the non - trivial part of @xmath42 in eq .  . this effect may affect the value of the skewness , but since it only induces a statistically homogeneous non - gaussianity , we simply ignore it here .",
    "the free correlation function @xmath55 of the bunch - davies vacuum is given by  @xcite @xmath60 , \\label{eq:31}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the geodesic distance between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we have @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , for a timelike ( imaginary @xmath67 ) , null ( @xmath68 ) , and spacelike ( real @xmath67 ) separation , respectively . as mentioned before , a branch of @xmath69 should be specified when @xmath64 and it can be done by adding small imaginary part @xmath70 to @xmath71 as @xmath72 .",

    "is straightforward in principle , but it is significantly simplified if we use the o(4)-symmetry of the @xmath5-point functions in the tunneling in - in formalism .",

    ", computing @xmath81 at @xmath82 , where integration over @xmath17 and @xmath83 is trivial , is enough since the value at any other point in the r - region can be known from the o(4)-symmetry .    after integrating over @xmath17 and @xmath83 , the integration over @xmath84 along @xmath47 remains .",
    "since the original path @xmath47 passes near the singularity , it makes the integral difficult to evaluate numerically . to avoid it",

    "now we study signatures of our model in the cmb anisotropy . in our model ,",
    "the evolution of the universe after the inflaton and the tunneling field decay , is exactly the same as the ordinary curvaton scenario  @xcite . here",
    ", we estimate the curvature perturbation after the curvaton decay by using the sudden - decay approximation  @xcite .",
    "after inflation the curvaton starts to roll down the potential and undergoes damped oscillations when the hubble parameter becomes smaller than @xmath98 .",
    "the curvaton energy density behaves like a pressureless matter during this stage of damped oscillations . at the time @xmath99",
    "when the curvatons decay , the energy density of the universe consists of that of radiation @xmath100 generated from the decay of the inflatons and that of the curvaton @xmath101 .",
    "the contribution of each component to the total curvature perturbation of the universe may be conveniently expressed in terms of @xmath102 and @xmath103 , which are defined as the curvature perturbations on the uniform energy density slices of the radiation and the curvaton , respectively .",
    "it is known that each of them is separately conserved on superhorizon scales at @xmath104 . as for @xmath103",
    ", it may be evaluated by the energy density fluctuations on the uniform inflaton field slice at the end of inflation , @xmath105 , as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the time at the end of inflation .",
    "after the curvaton decay , the total curvature perturbation on the slices of uniform total energy density , @xmath108 , is conserved on superhorizon scales .",
    "it is given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "for the moment , we ignore the contribution from @xmath111 and concentrate on the skewness generated by the nonlinear interaction with the tunneling field .",
    "then we have @xmath112 where @xmath113 is given by eq .  .",
    "an important feature is that the skewness of the curvature perturbation depends on the position of the bubble due to the spatial dependence of @xmath113 .",
    "to proceed , we focus only on the large angular scale cmb anisotropy for which the sachs - wolfe effect dominates . in this regime",
    ", the cmb temperature anisotropy can be written in terms of the curvature perturbation as @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the comoving position of the observer measured from the bubble center , @xmath116 is the directional cosine of the sky seen by the observer , @xmath117 is the comoving distance from the observer to the last scattering surface and @xmath118 is the time at the last scattering surface .",

    "let us discuss the additional contributions to @xmath6 which we have ignored .",
    "the contribution of @xmath102 to non - gaussianity is known to be very small as long as the vacuum is in the bunch - davies vacuum  @xcite .",
    "a deviation from the bunch - davies vacuum may give rise to a non - zero non - gaussianity .",
    "it is expected to be statistically homogeneous and isotropic but scale - dependent ( in the fourier space ) .",
    "it may be detected by the templates of the equilateral or orthogonal types .",
    "the contribution from the part of @xmath103 quadratic in @xmath121 gives rise to a local type non - gaussianity which is again statistically homogeneous and isotropic , and which may be detected by the squeezed type templates .",
    "this contribution from the nonlinearity of @xmath121 in @xmath103 may be estimated as follows . roughly speaking",
    ", @xmath122 for @xmath123 , and the contribution to @xmath124 is about @xmath125 .",
    "thus , the condition that @xmath6 is dominated by the nonlinear interaction with the bubble is given as @xmath126 this is satisfied in an example we compute below .",

    "for the variance @xmath134 we simply impose the observational result , @xmath135  @xcite , assuming that it is dominated by @xmath102 .",
    "a curvaton , since it never dominates the curvature perturbations .",
    "nevertheless , we call it a curvaton for notational convenience . ] since @xmath136 when @xmath123 , this assumption is justified if @xmath137 , which is marginally satisfied in the above example",
    ".    the typical value of @xmath6 at the center of the bubble when the parameters satisfy the above conditions is estimated as @xmath138 this gives @xmath139 for the parameters given above and agrees with the result in fig .",
    "[ fig : skymap ] within the errors shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f_mh ] . from this estimation , we find that the resultant @xmath6 is rather sensitive to the values of @xmath91 and @xmath140 .",
    "it is enhanced for smaller @xmath91 and larger @xmath140 .    .",
    ", width=264 ]",
    "in this paper , we calculated the skewness in the cmb temperature anisotropy in a model with bubble nucleation during inflation , motivated by the string theory landscape .",
    "we considered bubble nucleation in the curvaton scenario of inflation in which the curvaton vacuum fluctuations are affected by the bubble nucleation through interaction with the tunneling field .",
    "the calculation was done by extending the in - in formalism to the instanton background  @xcite .",
    "we found that there can be spatially localized , bubble - shaped skewness which is large inside the bubble .",
    "as far as we know , bubble - shaped non - gaussianities have not been studied carefully yet in observation .",
    "so it seems interesting to look for such a non - gaussianity already in the current observational data .",
    "as pointed out by komatsu and spergel  @xcite , the bispectrum , corresponding to the 3-point function , contains much more information than the single value of the skewness .",
    "thus , analysis beyond skewness may improve the observability of bubble - shaped non - gaussianities .",
    "we hope to come back to this issue in a future publication .",
    "since the string theory landscape gives a strong motivation for inflation models with bubble nucleation , studies of such inflation models may be regarded as testing string theory using the universe as a laboratory . in any case , if any signature of bubble nucleation during inflation is found in observation , it gives a huge impact on the physics of the early universe , including string theory .",
    "finally , we note that in the evaluation of the skewness we neglected the effect of deviations from the bunch - davies vacuum .",
    "this may affect details of our result , though generic features are expected to remain the same .",
