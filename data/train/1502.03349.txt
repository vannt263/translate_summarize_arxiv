    "the wilson fermion doubling phenomenon on the regular periodic lattices has been discovered long ago in @xcite .",

    "however , there exists a fundamental difference between the propagation of doubling modes on regular and irregular lattices . in the first case",
    "the propagator of the irregular modes is the same as the propagator of the regular modes from the spectrum origin , i.e. power - behaved . on the contrary ,",
    "the propagation of irregular modes on irregular lattice is similar to the markov process of a random walks .",
    "thus the propagator of irregular modes on irregular lattice decreases very quickly ( exponentially ) : the doubled irregular modes are `` bad '' quasiparticles .",

    "note that a part of information is lost in passing from the microscopic description to the long wavelength limit , and thus the property 3 ) becomes true .",
    "indeed , the information about the lattice is lost completely in the long wavelength limit and the lattice action ( [ dqg110 ] ) transforms to the usual continuum dirac action ( [ cor385 ] ) .",
    "therefore the correlator ( [ pr90 ] ) transforms to the expression ( [ pr40 ] ) with @xmath164 .",
    "now let s proceed to the estimation of the irregular quanta correlator . in this case",
    "the information related with the lattice is determinative . because of this ,",
    "eq . ( [ pr130 ] ) should be used . since the direct correlator estimation with the help of eq .",
    "( [ pr130 ] ) is impossible , i apply a simple and adequate computational model which describes the problem in terms of continuum theory .",
    "thus the model forgets the details of the lattice .",
    "it is supposed here that the microscopic geometry of the lattice is not fixed .",
    "this means that the elementary vectors ( [ dqg100 ] ) connecting the nearest vertices @xmath26 and @xmath104 are quantum variables , so that their quantum fluctuations are described by the corresponding wave function .",
    "this point of view is necessary in the lattice quantum theory of gravity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "though this theory is not satisfactory at present , i hold to the following point of view : if the space - time is discrete on microscopic level , then the corresponding lattice is irregular and the geometrical values describing the lattice are quantum variables .",
    "such lattice is called as `` breathing '' one .",
    "it seems that the propagation of an irregular fermion on the considered `` breathing '' lattice is similar in a sence to the dynamics of a brownian particle : in the process of successive movements of fermion from one vertex to another the information of a previous jump is forgotten due to the irregularity and `` breathing '' of the lattice .",
    "thus the propagation of irregular fermions can be described by a slightly modified markov process which must model the correlator ( [ pr130 ] ) in the 4-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "it is seen from eqs .",

    "it is seen that the direction of the jump vector @xmath204 is unconstrained , but the jump step value is constrained by the gauss distribution .",

    "therefore @xmath230 thus contour @xmath224 in the integral ( [ pr210 ] ) can de deformed up , so that the integral becomes a sum over poles residue .",
    "the sum is saturated by the pair of poles which are nearest to the real axis and placed at @xmath231 , where @xmath232 ( @xmath233 in ( [ pr230 ] ) ) .",

    "\\label{pr240}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the right - hand side of the relation ( [ pr50 ] ) simulates the obtained result ( [ pr240 ] ) in minkowski space - time with restored dimensionality .",
    "we see that the irregular quanta are `` bad '' quasiparticles .",
    "the fermion lines , such as in fig . 1 , represent creation ( at @xmath171 ) , propagation and annihilation ( at @xmath170 ) of a fermion quantum , and the quantum creation and annihilation events are induced by the external sources only . if the fermion line is everywhere continuous and endless in the space then it describes the propagation of a real particle .",
    "instead of a conclusion i would like to present briefly the motivational factor for the irregular doubled quanta study .",
    "let us suppose that the space - time is discrete on microscopic level , the corresponding lattice is irregular and `` breathing '' one ( see the previous section ) .",
    "suppose also that there are the nonzero densities of the irregular quanta of the three known neutrinos .",
    "the nonzero densities @xmath235 of the irregular quanta does not contradict the fundamental notions of astrophysics since the irregular quanta energy can be arbitrarily small ( see the end of section iv ) .          does the nonzero densities of the neutrino irregular quanta form dark matter in cosmology ?",
    "it seems that this hypothesis does not contradict to the main properties of dark matter : ( i ) the irregular quanta are `` bad '' quasiparticles , so such dark matter can be localized ; ( ii ) the irregular quanta interact very slightly with all normal quanta .",
    "the neutrino oscillations , i.e. the mutual oscillating transitions of the neutrinos of different generations , are observed for a long time now .",
    "the common explanation of the phenomenon is based on the assumption the neutrino mass matrix is non - diagonal",
    ". moreover , in order to match all the experimental evidences , the extra neutrino fields are introduced , which are sterile regarding to all interactions ( naturally , except gravitational one ) .",
    "the sterile neutrinos can not be observed directly : they are coupled to the three known neutrino generations only by means of a common mass matrix , and this is the way they give a contribution to the neutrino oscillations .",
    "the introduction of sterile neutrinos does not exhaust all difficulties of the theory : possibly , the most confounding factor of the theory consists in the fact that the electroweak interaction becomes nonrenormalizable one .",
    "now let s consider the possibility of another physics which may provide the neutrino oscillations .",
    "the basis for this physics is the wilson fermion doubling phenomenon on irregular lattices discussed above .",
    "let s consider the scattering of the usual normal long - wavelength electron neutrino quantum with the momentum @xmath236 , @xmath237 , by the condensate of muon irregular quanta .",
    "suppose the interaction is mediated by the gravitational field .",
    "this scattering process is pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . obviously , time - mean value of the irregular quantum momentum is equal to zero , and the corresponding necessary minimal averaging time @xmath238 .",
    "this means that the latter has zero momentum in the interaction process of the long - wavelength neutrino quantum with neutrino irregular excitation .",
    "suppose also that vacuum is translation invariant . then the scattering process in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] conserve the momentum of the long - wavelength neutrino : @xmath239 . the same process as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] takes place under @xmath240 and @xmath241 interchanging .",
    "finally , we conclude that the neutrino oscillations should be observed since there are mutual transitions of the electron and muon neutrinos with fixed and equal momenta ."
