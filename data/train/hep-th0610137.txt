    "the combinatorial structure underlying renormalization in perturbative quantum field theory was transparent in the original approach of bogogliubov , hepp , parasiuk and zimmerman ( cf . for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.5 ) ) .",
    "it was realized by kreimer in @xcite that this structure is in fact organized by a hopf algebra of rooted trees .",
    "one year later , connes and kreimer @xcite reformulated this combinatorial structure directly in terms of a ( commutative ) hopf algebra of feynman graphs and understood the bphz - procedure as a birkhoff decomposition in the group that is dual to this hopf algebra .    in physics",
    ", however , one usually works in the setting of functional calculus since  although defined only formally  functional integrals are particularly well - suited for the perturbative treatment of quantum gauge theories .",
    "for example , the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities that are the reminiscents of the gauge symmetry of the classical field theory , can be gathered elegantly in a single equation known as the _ zinn - justin equation _ , and involving the effective action .",
    "although this approach is very powerful in showing for example renormalizability of gauge field theories , the applicability of the graph - per - graph approach of the bphz - renormalization procedure is not so transparent any more , and the same holds for the combinatorial structure underlying it .",
    "recent developments @xcite give more insight in the combinatorial aspects of non - abelian gauge theories . in @xcite , we considered the hopf algebra of feynman graphs in quantum electrodynamics and found that certain ward ",
    "takahashi identities can be imposed as relations on this hopf algebra .    in this article",
    ", we continue to explore the combinatorial structure of gauge theories in terms of a hopf algebra .",
    "more precisely , we will show that the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities between the coupling constants can be implemented as relations on the hopf algebra , that is , in a way compatible with the counit , coproduct and antipode .",
    "this then provides a combinatorial proof of the compatibility of the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities with renormalization .",
    "we start in section [ sect : prel ] with a precise setup of the hopf algebra of feynman graphs in a generic theory , including gauge theories , and derive a formula for the coproduct on 1pi green s functions .",
    "such green s functions are sums of all 1pi graphs with a certain fixed external structure , including symmetry factors .",
    "it is the latter that make this derivation slightly involved .",
    "section [ sect : ward ] we will be a warming - up for the non - abelian case , by considering quantum electrodynamics , which is an abelian gauge theory . using the expression for the coproduct on the green s functions ,",
    "we show that certain ward identities can be imposed as ( linear ) relations on the hopf algebra .",
    "in other words , they define a hopf ideal .",
    "the case of non - abelian gauge theories will be consided in section [ sect : st ] , where we will show that the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities define quadratic relations in the hopf algebra .",
    "in fact , as we will see , it is in the very nature of the combinatorial factors that are involved that the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities appear .",
    "we have added two appendices . in the first , we rederive the compatibility of ward identities with the hopf algebra structure in qed obtained in section [ sect : ward ] from our previous result on ward  takahashi identities in @xcite .",
    "in the second appendix , we list some useful basic combinatorial identities used throughout the text .",
    "we start with some definitions on feynman graphs and their symmetries , thereby making precise several properties needed later .",
    "the feynman graphs we will consider are built from a certain set of edges and vertices @xmath0 , and we write @xmath1 . for example , in @xmath2-theory , the set @xmath3 contains the bi- and trivalent vertex and @xmath4 the straight line , but more interesting theories such as gauge theories contain different types of edges and vertices ( for example involving curly , dotted and straight lines ) corresponding to different particles .",
    "more precisely , we have the following definition @xcite .    a feynman graph @xmath5 is given by a set @xmath6 of vertices each of which is an element in @xmath3 and @xmath7 of edges in @xmath4 , and maps @xmath8 that are compatible with the type of vertex and edge as parametrized by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the set @xmath9 labels the external lines , so that @xmath10 for all @xmath11 .",
    "the set of external lines is @xmath12 and its complement @xmath13 in @xmath7 is the set of internal lines .",
    "we remark that the elements in @xmath14 can thus be labeled as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and we understand this labeling as being fixed . with this definition ,",
    "the notion of a graph automorphism can be defined as follows .",
    "an automorphism of a feynman graph @xmath5 is given by an isomorphism @xmath17 from @xmath6 to itself , and an isomorphism @xmath18 from @xmath7 to itself that is the identity on @xmath14 and such that for all @xmath19 , @xmath20 moreover , we require @xmath17 and @xmath17 to respect the type of vertex / edge in the set @xmath0 . + the automorphism group @xmath21 of @xmath5 consists of all such automorphisms ; its order is called the symmetry factor of @xmath5 and is denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "similarly , there is a notion of an isomorphism of two graphs @xmath5 and @xmath23 as a pair of maps that intertwines the maps @xmath24 as in eq . .",
    "we remark that we correct in this way for the apparent orientation given by the two maps @xmath25 and @xmath26 and we stress that the fermionic lines are unoriented .",
    "we take the complex character of the fermionic fields into account by summing over all possible orientations once we apply the feynman rules .",
    "the above definition of automorphism differs from the usual notion of graph automorphism ( cf .",
    "for instance @xcite ) in that the latter might also permute the elements in @xmath27 when understood as external vertices . in the above notation",

    "equivalently , one has for a 1pi graph @xmath23 , @xmath36 with @xmath37 the number of connected components of @xmath38 that are isomorphic to @xmath23 .",
