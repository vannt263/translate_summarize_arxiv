    "modulation and direct detection ( im / dd ) is widely used in optical communications . in im / dd ,",
    "information is conveyed by the varying intensity of transmitted optical signal , and the receiver detects the intensity of the received signal .",
    "there have been extensive studies on design and realization of im / dd based optical wireless communication systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this paper focuses on a simplified im / dd channel model , known as the optical intensity channel with gaussian noise .",
    "this model is suitable for some kinds of im / dd systems , e.g. , indoor free space optical communications @xcite . in optical intensity channels , typically the average and/or peak optical power",
    "is constrained due to safety reasons and practical considerations .",
    "therefore the optical intensity channel we considered has two fundamental differences with electrical channel models like the classical awgn channel : 1 ) a nonnegativity constraint on the input signal , 2 ) a different input cost metric .",
    "it is clear that typical signaling methods for electrical channels can not be applied directly in optical intensity channels because of these differences .",
    "a number of information theoretic studies on optical intensity channels have been reported , mostly on discrete - time optical intensity channels ( dtoic ) ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "for dtoic with only an average power constraint , the exact capacity is still unknown , whereas tight upper and lower bounds have been established .",
    "when the input is further bounded from above due to a peak power constraint , the optimal input distribution and the capacity can be numerically computed @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent works have provided systematic results on capacity - achieving input design for dtoic @xcite , @xcite .",
    "only a few information theoretic studies have considered continuous - time optical intensity channel models . in @xcite ,",
    "sphere packing based capacity upper bounds for multicarrier optical intensity channels ( mcoic ) were established .",
    "capacity bounds for bandlimited optical intensity channels ( bloic ) with an average power constraint were studied in @xcite . in another aspect ,",
    "the design of isi - free signaling over bloic was studied in @xcite , while the information rate was not considered therein .",
    "the bloic model considered in this paper is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is bandlimited to @xmath2 $ ] , @xmath3 is white gaussian noise ( the definition follows that in @xcite ) of one - sided power spectral density @xmath4 with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "the bandwidth constraint of bloic is due to the optoelectronic components and multipath distortion @xcite . in ( [ eqn : bloic ] ) , without loss of generality we set the channel gain ( including , e.g. , the responsivity of the photodiode and the optoelectronic conversion factor in im / dd systems ) to be unity , as in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the dtoic @xmath6=x[n]+z[n],\\mspace{16mu}x[n]\\ge 0\\ ] ] is the discrete - time analog of ( [ eqn : bloic ] ) , where @xmath7\\sim \\mathrm{n}(0,\\sigma^{2})$ ] ( @xmath8 denotes gaussian distribution with mean @xmath9 and variance @xmath10 ) is independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) .    to model the input constraint",
    ", we define the instantaneous powers as @xmath11 and @xmath12)=x[n]$ ] for bloic and dtoic , respectively .",
    "these definitions are different from those of the electrical power which is proportional to the squared amplitude of the signal . then the average power is @xmath13\\right]$ ] in dtoic . in bloic ,",
    "the average power is defined as @xmath14.\\ ] ] here we follow the definition of [ [ lapidoth ] , definition 14.6.1 ] .    for most classical channels such as the awgn channel , the linear gaussian channel or fading channels , we have the following relationship between the capacity of the continuous - time bandlimited channel model and its discrete - time analog with the same signal - to - noise ratio : @xmath15 this relationship can be established by orthogonal transforms , e.g. , by nyquist rate signaling / sampling or more rigorously by karhunen - love expansion and the 2wt theorem . has essentially @xmath16 degrees of freedom ( dofs ) in a length-@xmath17 time interval , where @xmath18 and dof is defined as the dimension of the signal space in that time interval .",
    "] moreover , signaling schemes designed based on discrete - time models can be directly utilized in bandlimited communications by simple modulation / demodulation methods . because of these facts , many studies based on classical channels reasonably consider only the discrete - time channel models , where the relationship between the discrete - time channel inputs ( i.e. @xmath19 $ ] ) and the continuous - time signal they represent ( i.e. @xmath20 ) is @xmath21 \\frac{\\sin \\pi ( 2wt - n)}{\\pi ( 2wt - n)}.\\ ] ]    however , in this paper we emphasize that the aforementioned equivalent relationship does not hold between dtoic and bloic .",
    "according to ( [ eqn : xidealbl1 ] ) , it is easy to verify that the equivalent bandlimited waveform of a given nonnegative input sequence is not necessarily nonnegative everywhere . in other words , it is possible that an admissible input sequence in dtoic corresponds to an inadmissible input waveform in bloic",
    ". then it is clear that the capacity of bloic can not be obtained by solving the capacity problem of dtoic and using ( [ eqn : bldt ] ) .",
    "therefore , when a bandwidth constraint exists , using dtoic as the model of a continuous - time optical intensity channel is an _ oversimplification _ of the capacity problem .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", @xcite is the only information theoretic study directly on the bloic model ( [ eqn : bloic ] ) .",
    "this study is restricted to time - disjoint signaling ( tds ) based on a finite ( typically low ) dimensional signal space model over a finite time interval . using that model , the continuous - time channel is converted to a discrete - time vector gaussian channel and the input nonnegativity constraint",
    "is correspondingly converted to an admissible region in the signal space .",
    "capacity bounds are derived based on the converted vector gaussian channel with the admissible input region .",
    "it is thus clear that the upper bounds obtained therein are only information rate upper bounds of specific tds schemes , rather than capacity upper bounds for the bloic .",
    "moreover , due to the finite time length of the signal space model , the bandwidth constraint can only be approximately satisfied by permitting an @xmath22-fractional out - of - band energy .",
    "since the bandwidth is sensitive to @xmath22 , varying @xmath22 causes the achievable spectral efficiency to vary significantly .",
    "when @xmath22 tends to zero the achievable spectral efficiency tends to zero . even for a fixed @xmath22 and",
    "given bandwidth , the signaling rate is limited due to the poor time - frequency concentration of the rectangular basis function needed in the bloic signal space model .",
    "so the available dofs of the bandlimited channel is hardly exploited in the most efficient way .      in this paper , we study the fundamental limits of communication over the bloic under different types of input constraints . by designing admissible pulse amplitude modulated ( pam ) input waveform ensembles with i.i.d .",
    "input symbols and lower bounding their maximum achievable information rates , we derive two kinds of capacity lower bounds : the dof - optimal lower bounds and the isi - free signaling based lower bounds .",
    "the dof - optimal lower bounds achieve the optimal pre - log factor of the channel capacity by comparing with capacity upper bounds derived from constraint relaxation .",
    "thus we characterize the high - snr capacity of the bloic to within a finite gap . for example , the high - snr asymptotic gap between the tightest lower and upper capacity bounds for the only average power constrained case is 4.34 db in snr .",
    "the isi - free signaling is preferred in practical communication systems because of its low detection complexity .",
    "we show that the isi - free signaling based lower bounds perform well for all practical snr values , especially for low to moderate snr . at high snr , introducing a direct current ( dc ) bias in the signal design is shown to be very helpful for boosting the information rate .",
    "we also study the effects of different peak - to - average - power ratios and different types of modulation pulses ( i.e. shaping filters ) on the capacity lower bounds , and give several conjectures and discussions .",
    "all these results provide understanding on fundamental limits and signaling scheme design for bandlimited communications using im / dd .",
