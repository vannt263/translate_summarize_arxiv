    "neutrino geoscience is a new interdisciplinary field aiming to measure the earth s radiogenic heat , providing an important benchmark for geosciences .",
    "these topics are briefly summarized here .",
    "due to the non - zero value of @xmath3 , a signature of the neutrino mass hierarchy is present in the oscillation of antineutrinos emitted by nuclear reactors  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino mass - squared differences @xmath4= @xmath5 cause energy - dependent @xmath6 disappearance , introducing a distortion of the reactor @xmath6 energy spectrum .",
    "the oscillation frequencies caused by @xmath7 and @xmath8 differ by only 3% according to measurements of @xmath9 .",
    "measurements of the mixing angles predict that the @xmath6 oscillation amplitude from @xmath7 is twice as large as that from @xmath8 .",
    "the mass hierarchy can be discerned by whether the smaller - amplitude @xmath8 oscillation is at a slightly lower ( normal ) or higher ( inverted ) frequency .",
    "discrimination of these two frequencies from the distortion of the reactor @xmath6 energy spectrum is most pronounced at the first @xmath9 oscillation maximum , or roughly @xmath060  km from a reactor .",
    "two experiments have been proposed to determine the mass hierarchy using reactor @xmath6 : the jiangmen underground neutrino observatory ( juno )  @xcite and the reno-50 experiment  @xcite .",
    "the juno experiment will be located in an new underground laboratory ( 700  m rock overburden ) in kaiping city , jiangmen region , guangdong province in southern china .",
    "reactor antineutrinos will be produced by the yangjiang and taishan commercial reactor facilities , each located 53  km from the planned site .",
    "each facility will have six reactors , with a total power of 17.4  gw@xmath10 and 18.4  gw@xmath10 respectively .",
    "both facilities are currently under construction , with 26.6  gw@xmath10 of power in operation by 2020 .",
    "as designed , the juno detector consists of a 20  kton target of liquid scintillator contained in a 35.4  m - diameter transparent acrylic sphere .",
    "light produced by @xmath6 interactions in the target is detected by 15000 20-inch photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) mounted on a stainless steel frame surrounding the target .",
    "the entire system is contained within an active water cherenkov veto detector , instrumented with 1500 additional pmts .",

    "current research and development is focused on increasing the collected light by scintillator purification to reduce light attenuation , exploring new designs for high efficiency pmts , and maximizing the pmt surface coverage .",
    "the mechanical integrity , stresses , and aging of the acrylic target container are also under study . to reduce the cabling required for the large number of pmts , the collaboration is testing prototype electronics for underwater installation close to the pmts . aside from the mass hierarchy , the juno experiment intends to measure @xmath14 , @xmath9 , and @xmath7 to better than 1% precision .",
    "measurements of solar neutrinos , atmospheric neutrinos , geoneutrinos , sterile neutrinos , proton decay , and other exotic models are being explored .",

    "combined , these discrepancies have been interpreted as possible evidence of oscillation to hypothetical sterile neutrino states  @xcite .    on average",
    ", six @xmath6 are emitted by the beta decays of the fragment isotopes from a single fission .",
    "direct calculation of reactor @xmath6 emission is complicated by the lack of detailed knowledge of the energy levels and decay spectra for the @xmath010000 unique beta decays which contribute . instead",
    ", existing models rely on prediction of the cumulative @xmath6 flux using measurements of the corresponding cumulative @xmath15 emitted by fissioning isotopes  @xcite .",

    "recent reevaluation increased the predicted @xmath6 flux by 6% relative to previous estimates .",
    "half of the increase is a result of improved modeling of the correlation between the cumulative energy spectra of @xmath15 and @xmath6 from fission fragments .",
    "the remaining increase is caused by inclusion of long - lived fission daughter isotopes , and updated measurements of the neutron lifetime which increase the predicted cross section for @xmath6 interaction with the detector .",
    "measurements of the reactor @xmath6 flux are on average 6% lower than these recent predictions",
    ".    preliminary measurements of the energy spectra of reactor @xmath6 reported this past summer disagree with the prevailing models  @xcite .",

    "direct calculations of the corresponding @xmath15 spectra also disagree with the measurements from refs .",
    "the measured @xmath6 and cumulative @xmath15 spectra seem inconsistent , although including spectral corrections from forbidden beta decays may be able to accommodate both .",

    "pulse shape discrimination improved identification of @xmath6 interactions from background due to energetic neutrons . with a detection efficiency of @xmath030% , a rate of @xmath16 @xmath6 interactions per day was measured from april to may 2013 .",
    "the sensitivity was limited by a large background of high energy gamma rays in close proximity to the reactor .",
    "the stereo experiment is a successor to the nucifer experiment .",
    "it will search for oscillation to sterile states using @xmath6 emitted by the 58  mw@xmath10 compact highly - enriched uranium core at the institut laue - langevin ( ill ) in grenoble , france .",
    "the detector is sensitive to oscillation via the relative rates and energy spectra measured by six 0.3  m@xmath17 cells of gd - loaded liquid scintillator arranged along the direction of @xmath6 emission .",
    "four pmts collect the light produced by interactions in each cell .",
    "based on geant4 simulations , the detector will have 11% energy resolution for 2  mev positrons , and have @xmath060% efficiency for neutron detection .",
    "validation of a prototype detector is planned for sep .",
    "extensive gamma ray and neutron shielding ( lead , polyethylene , b@xmath18c ) will be used to mitigate backgrounds from the research neutron beam lines at ill .",
    "two additional scintillator cells , one at the front and one at back of the detector , will veto external background and improve containment of gamma rays generated in the target .",
    "an signal rate of 400 @xmath6 per day is expected . with 300 days of data ,",
    "sensitivity to 5% sterile mixing with @xmath19 of 2  ev@xmath20 at the 95% confidence level is predicted .",
    "the experiment plans to begin operation in spring  2015 .",
    "the prospect experiment proposes to search for disappearance of reactor @xmath6 from the high flux isotope reactor ( hfir ) at oak ridge national laboratory  @xcite .",
    "this reactor uses a compact ( @xmath00.5  m diameter ) 85  mw highly - enriched uranium core .",
    "the first phase of the experiment consists of a 2.5  ton optically - segmented liquid scintillator detector located at @xmath07  m from the reactor core .",
    "the estimated signal rate is @xmath01000  @xmath6 inverse beta decay interactions per day within this detector . using the variation in the measured signal between detector segments over one year ,",
    "5% sterile mixing with @xmath19@xmath212  ev@xmath20 can be tested at the 3@xmath22 confidence level .",
    "the second phase adds an additional 20  ton detector at @xmath018  m from the reactor , with 5@xmath22 sensitivity over the region suggested by existing anomalies .",
    "the @xmath6 energy spectrum from the hfir reactor is dominated by fission of @xmath23u , and measurement would provide a stringent test of @xmath6 emission models .",
    "neutron and gamma ray detectors have been used to make recent measurements of the background radiation at the hfir site .",
    "significant spatial and temporal variations in the backgrounds have been found .",
    "observed gamma rays with energies up to 10  mev are attributed to thermal neutron capture on materials in the vicinity of the reactor .",
    "lithium - doped liquid scintillator has been developed to improve localization of the @xmath6 interaction position via n + @xmath24li @xmath25 @xmath26 + @xmath17h .",
    "initial tests using a @xmath27cf radioactive source also show significant pulse - shape discrimination of neutron captures on @xmath24li from gamma ray interactions , suggesting high - efficiency background rejection for the reactor @xmath6 measurement .",
    "instead of using reactor @xmath6 , the sox experiment will use @xmath6 and @xmath28 emitted by intense radioactive sources to test sterile neutrino models  @xcite .",
    "the existing borexino detector at the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ( lngs ) provides a convenient instrument to measure the neutrinos emitted by radioactive sources .",
    "the detector consists of a 300  ton spherical target of liquid scintillator suspended within a transparent nylon vessel .",
    "the target is surrounded by a 2.4  m thick transparent layer of buffer liquid shielding it from external radioactivity .",
    "scintillation light is detected by 2212 pmts .",
    "this inner detector is contained within a 2.1  kton water cherenkov veto detector to reject cosmic ray induced backgrounds .",
    "intense radioactive sources of @xmath6 and @xmath28 will be placed in a cavity 8.5  m below the center of the detector .",
    "the initial measurement will use a @xmath29ce-@xmath29pr antineutrino source .",
    "the slow beta decay of @xmath29ce gives the source a relatively long half - life of 285  days .",
    "the subsequent fast beta decay of @xmath29pr emits @xmath6 with a maximum energy of 3.0  mev , above the 1.8  mev threshold for detection via inverse beta decay .",
    "a 100  kci source is currently being manufactured by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel at the mayak facility in russia .",
    "measurement is planned to begin at the end of 2015 , and is predicted to be sensitive to 5% sterile mixing at the 95% confidence level after a year of operation .",
    "a @xmath30cr source emits monoenergetic 0.75  mev neutrinos via electron capture with a half - life of 27.7  days .",
    "these neutrinos can be detected via elastic scattering on @xmath31 in the scintillator target .",
    "capsules containing a total of 36  kg of chromium , enriched to 38% of @xmath32cr , will be neutron - activated to @xmath05  mci at the high flux isotope reactor ( hfir ) at oak ridge national laboratory . given the lower cross - section and larger background rate for @xmath28 detection , the source will need to be activated and measured twice to reach sensitivity similar to the @xmath29ce experiment .",
    "transport of these intense sources from the production sites to lngs requires significant planning .      coherent scattering of neutrinos on nuclei ( cenns ) is a yet unobserved weak interaction process  @xcite .",
    "the coherent recoil of all nucleons in the nucleus enhances the cross - section as @xmath33 .",
    "the resulting signal is a low energy nuclear recoil , visible as @xmath01  kev electron - equivalent ionization in a detector .",
    "measurement of cenns could be relevant to a wide range of topics including supernova dynamics  @xcite , sterile neutrinos  @xcite , and precision tests of the weak interaction  @xcite .",
    "a collaboration has recently been formed to organize disparate detector development toward a coordinated measurement of cenns using the spallation neutron source ( sns ) at oak ridge national laboratory .",
    "the decay - at - rest of spallation pions and muons provide a flux of @xmath34 neutrinos @xmath35 s@xmath36 at a distance of 20  m from the sns .",
    "backgrounds uncorrelated with the sns pulses are negligible due to the low duty factor @xmath0@xmath37 .",
    "background from energetic neutrons produced by the sns are significant .",
    "measurements of the neutron flux using a coded aperture neutron detector array identified the sns basement as promising detector location at 20  m from the source .",
    "additional background is predicted from neutrons produced by neutrino inelastic excitation of lead commonly used for detector shielding .",
    "a in - situ measurement of this background is imminent , with an expected detection of @xmath0300 neutrons over 60 days of operation .",
    "measurement of this process is relevant for the halo supernova neutrino detector  @xcite , as well as for supernova dynamics  @xcite .",
    "measurement of neutrino - inelastic neutron emission for other elements ( fe , w , cu , bi , etc . ) is also being considered .",
    "the theoretical solar neutrino fluxes are predicted by the standard solar model ( ssm )  @xcite , based on the stellar structure equations , solar chemical evolution paradigm , and observational constraints , including the surface composition . a reevaluation of the latter ( agss09  @xcite ) led to substantially lower abundances of heavy elements ( @xmath38 ) with respect to the previous work gs98  @xcite .",
    "the solar metallicity problem arose : the new agss09 compositional model , to the contrary of the older gs98 , leads to a strong discrepancy between helioseismological data and the ssm predictions .",
    "no fully satisfactory solution to this puzzle has been found yet , including attempts to vary solar opacity or to consider non - standard chemical evolution of the sun . since the predicted solar - neutrino fluxes depend on the solar metallicity , their measurement can help in solving this puzzle .",
    "recently , the abundances of volatiles ( c , n , o , ne ) and refractories ( mg , si , s , fe ) has been inferred from helioseismic and solar neutrino data  @xcite .",
    "the best - fit abundances are consistent at 1@xmath22 with gs98 , however it is not possible to disentangle the degeneracies among individual elements .",
    "the primary reaction of the so called @xmath39-cycle , a sequence of nuclear reactions that converts hydrogen into helium and powers the sun , is the fusion of two protons with the emission of a low - energy neutrino .",
    "these so - called @xmath39 neutrinos constitute nearly the entirety of the solar neutrino flux .",
    "borexino collaboration has reported the first spectral observation of these neutrinos  @xcite with 11% precision , demonstrating that about 99% of the power of the sun , 3.8431033 ergs per second , is generated by the proton - proton fusion process .",
    "this measurement also confirms the solar stability at @xmath40-years time scale , by showing that at this level of precision the photon and neutrino luminosities are in agreement .",
    "the gs98 and agss09 models predict the flux of 0.862kev @xmath41be solar neutrinos which differs by about 9%  @xcite .",
    "the best value of the 5% precision measurement of the interaction rate of these neutrinos , achieved by borexino  @xcite , falls just in between the two predictions ; thus , new measurements are still important . after an extensive purification of the 1kton of liquid scintillator in years 2008 - 2009",
    ", the kamland collaboration has performed the second direct measurement of the @xmath41be neutrinos  @xcite with 15% precision . utilizing a global three flavour oscillation analysis , the observed rate of @xmath42 ( kton @xmath43 day)@xmath36 corresponds to the @xmath41be solar neutrino flux of @xmath44 @xmath35 s@xmath36 , which is consistent with both ssm predictions .",
    "the main goal of the sno@xmath45 experiment  @xcite , placed in the snolab in canada , is the measurement of the neutrino - less double - beta decay ( @xmath46 ) by means of 0.3% loading of scintillator with 800 kg of @xmath47te ( using natural te ) planned for spring 2016 .",
    "the detector will be filled with water in spring 2015 , while with 1kton of lab scintillator in fall 2015 .",
    "@xmath48b solar neutrinos are one of the irreducible backgrounds for the @xmath46 measurement and are planned to be measured by sno@xmath49 .",
    "assuming that radio - purity similar to borexino is reached , a broader solar neutrino program is planned after the @xmath47te measurement . a major advantage for the sno@xmath49 measurement of @xmath50 and cno neutrinos is the 6000m.w.e of shielding provided by the rock overburden , reducing the @xmath51c cosmogenic background by a factor of 100 with respect to borexino .",
    "solar neutrinos have played a fundamental historical role in the discovery of the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations and thus non - zero neutrino mass .",
    "even today , their study provides an important insight not only to solar and stellar physics , but also into the physics of the neutrino itself .",
    "solar neutrino physics is pinning down the lma - msw oscillation solution and is testing non - standard neutrino interaction models by measuring the energy - dependent electron neutrino survival probability @xmath52 and matter effects .",
    "the latter can be tested by comparing the day and night rates of solar neutrinos , since only during the night the neutrinos cross the earth .",
    "after the exclusion of a day - night asymmetry at 1% precision level at @xmath41be -neutrino energies performed by borexino  @xcite , super - kamiokande has successfully provided the first direct indication that neutrino oscillation probabilities are modified by the presence of matter by measuring the night - regeneration of electron flavour for higher - energy @xmath48b solar neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "they determined the day - night asymmetry , defined as the difference of the average day and night rates , divided by their average , to be @xmath53 ( stat ) @xmath54 0.5(syst))% , which deviates from zero by 2.7@xmath22 .",
    "this asymmetry is consistent with neutrino oscillations for @xmath55m@xmath56ev@xmath20 and large mixing values of @xmath14 , at the 68% c.l . for what concerns @xmath52 , the vacuum - dominated low - energy region @xmath57 mev is directly tested by borexino data  @xcite while the matter - dominated high - energy region is tested at best by sno  @xcite and super - kamiokande  @xcite @xmath48b data .",
    "it is also worth mention that the current best fit values of @xmath58 based on solar neutrino data and kamland reactor antineutrino data  @xcite are in a slight tension at about 2@xmath22 level  @xcite .      a supernova ( sn ) explosion happens when a star at least 8 times more massive than the sun collapses .",
    "neutrinos with energies up to several tens of mev carry away in a burst lasting few seconds almost 99% of the released gravitational energy of the order of @xmath0@xmath59 erg  @xcite .",
    "supernova neutrino detection would provide significant information about star collapse physics and also about neutrino physics , by studying the energy spectra , time profile , and flavour composition of sn neutrinos .",
    "world - wide , several detectors currently running ( icecube , kamland , super - kamiokande , baksan , lvd , borexino , halo ) or nearing completion ( sno@xmath49 ) are sensitive to a core - collapse supernovae neutrino signal in the milky way ( expected @xmath03 sn/ 100 years ) .",
    "the neutrino signal emerges promptly from a supernova s core , whereas it may take hours for the first photons to be visible .",
    "putting several detectors in coincidence can provide the astronomical community with a very high confidence early warning of the supernova s occurrence .",
    "for this purpose , an international snews alarm system has been set - up  @xcite and soon will include also gravitational wave experiments",
    ". the super - kamiokande 32kton water cherekov detector would detect @xmath07300 inverse beta decay interactions and @xmath0300 elastic scatterings from a 10 kpc distant sn , providing statistics sufficient to test sn models  @xcite . in spite of the multi - gev energy threshold of ice - cube",
    ", the burst of galactic sn neutrinos would be recognized as a coincident increase in single pmt count rate .",
    "liquid scintillator detectors expect about 700 events / kton , dominated by the inverse beta - decay and neutral - current @xmath1 + proton interactions .",
    "the expected rate of sn from neighboring galaxy clusters ( mpc scale ) is quite high , about 1  sn per year .",
    "however , for their detection , next generation multi - mton detectors would be required .",
    "neutrinos emitted from the past sn at gpc scale are red - shifted by cosmic expansion and are often referred to as supernova diffuse or relic neutrinos ( dsn or rsn ) .",
    "the expected flux of @xmath60  @xcite of about 20 @xmath35 s@xmath36 would lead to the detection of few events per year per 20 kton ( the size of the juno detector planned to start data - taking in 2020 ) in 10 - 30 mev energy range . for their successful detection , an efficient technique to suppress the background from neutral current interaction of atmospheric neutrinos and fast neutrons",
    "is necessary .",
    "super - kamiokande s potential to detect rsn  @xcite via inverse beta decay is limited mostly due to the low efficiency of detection of 2.2 mev gamma from neutron capture on protons .",
    "the egads experiment is an ongoing r&d program for the gazooks !",
    "project  @xcite , in which super - kamiokande would be doped with gadolinium .",
    "gadolinium has a large cross section for thermal neutron capture , after which 3 - 4 @xmath61 s of 8 mev total energy are emitted and can be efficiently detected .",
    "the so called pre - supernova neutrinos are expected to be emitted during the si - burning phase  @xcite .",
    "their emission should start a few days before the core - collapse sn and their flux should gradually increase up to the sn burst .",
    "due to the reduced flux , their detection would be possible only from relatively close stars , such as antares ( 170 pc ) or betelgeuse ( 150 pc ) and could be used as an early alarm of core - collapse burst .",
    "the study of their possible detection at kamland and gadzooks ! is ongoing  @xcite .    in dense neutrino backgrounds present in supernovae and in the early universe",
    ", neutrino oscillations may exhibit complex collective phenomena , such as synchronized oscillations , bipolar oscillations , and spectral splits and swaps .",
    "the effects of decoherence by wave packet separation on these phenomena have been studied for the first time by akhmedov et al .",
    "it was shown that decoherence may modify the oscillation pattern significantly and can lead to qualitatively new effects , like for example strong flavour conversion , absent in the case of the usual msw oscillations .",
    "geoneutrinos , electron antineutrinos from natural @xmath62-decays of long - lived radioactive elements inside the earth , bring to the surface unique information about our planet .",
    "the new techniques in neutrino detection opened a door into a completely new inter - disciplinary field at the border of particle physics and geology .",
    "the main goal of this study is to estimate the earth s radiogenic heat , that is , the amount of heat released in the decays along the @xmath63u and @xmath64th chains and that of @xmath65k : a key parameter for both geophysical and geochemical models . the upper limit for the possible radiogenic heat is the measured integrated surface heat flux of @xmath66tw  @xcite .",
    "the total radiogenic power contributing to this flux is not well known ; different so - called bulk silicate earth s models , summarized for example in  @xcite , predict a wide range of possible values in the range of @xmath67tw . while the crustal radiogenic heat is relatively well known to be @xmath68tw @xcite , the mantle contribution",
    "is poorly known : its determination is the principal goal of geoneutrino studies .",
    "the current experimental technique to detect geoneutrinos , using large - volume liquid scintillator detectors , is based on the inverse beta - decay reaction @xmath69 , enabling a space - time coincidence tag between the prompt ( positron ) and delayed ( @xmath61 from neutron capture ) signal , strongly suppressing the background .",
    "the kinematic threshold for this reaction is 1.8 mev and thus only a high - energy tail of @xmath63u and @xmath64th geoneutrinos can be detected , while @xmath65k signal is completely out of reach . in geoneutrino measurement ,",
    "the most critical background sources are the antineutrinos from reactor power plants , while the dominant non - antineutrino backgrounds mimicking the coincidence tag are cosmogenically produced @xmath70li-@xmath48he decaying ( @xmath62 + n ) , ( @xmath26 , n ) interactions , and accidental coincidences .",
    "only two underground experiments have succeeded in detecting geoneutrinos : borexino in italy and kamland in japan , very far away from each other and placed in different geological environments .",
    "borexino with its about 280 tons of liquid scintillator is about 3 times smaller with respect to kamland , but has much better radiopurity , so its non - antineutrino background is completely negligible .",
    "both collaborations updated their results in 2013 .",
    "borexino has detected 14.3 @xmath54 4.4 geoneutrinos in @xmath71 proton @xmath43 year exposure collected from december 2007 to august 2012  @xcite .",
    "kamland has detected @xmath72 geoneutrino events in @xmath73 proton @xmath43 year exposure collected from march 2002 and november 2012  @xcite .",
    "a convenient unit for the measured signal is the normalized event rate , expressed as the so called terrestrial neutrino unit ( tnu ) , defined as the number of interactions detected during one year on a target of @xmath74 protons ( @xmath01kton of liquid scintillator ) and with 100% detection efficiency .",
    "the borexino and kamland results , expressed in this way , are @xmath75 and @xmath76 tnu , respectively .",
    "the total abundance of the long - lived radioactive elements and the radiogenic heat are in a well fixed ratio , while the geoneutrino flux at the earth s surface depends also on the distribution of the radioactive elements in the earth interior .",
    "thus , to extract from a measured geoneutrino flux the radiogenic heat is not straightforward and does include assumptions about the distribution of the heat producing elements .",
    "both existent results are compatible with geological expectations , confirming that the new interdisciplinary field is born .",
    "however , mostly due to limited statistics , firm geologically significant results are not available yet . keeping this in mind ,",
    "the first indications of a measured mantle signal and the radiogenic heat do exist , as it was shown for example in  @xcite combining both borexino and kamland data .",
    "both experiments will continue to take data , and some other experiments have geoneutrinos among their scientific goals ( 1 kton sno@xmath49 in canada  @xcite starting soon and 20 kton juno in china planned for 2020 ) .",
    "a real breakthrough will come from the next generation of experiments , eventually placed in a carefully selected locations in which the crustal contribution to the signal can be well predicted  @xcite or is small , like for example on the oceanic crust ( hanohano project  @xcite ) . measuring geoneutrinos around the globe has also its importance because it can test the homogeneity of the earth s interior .",
    "measurements of low energy neutrinos and antineutrinos have revealed the character of our natural world , and are expected to continue to produce interesting results .",
    "not only do measurements address the fundamental nature of these weakly - interacting particles , but they can also serve as unique probes of stars , supernovae , and the earth .",
    "the topics discussed during the `` oscillation at low energies '' parallel session of the neutrino oscillation workshop 2014 suggest that the coming years of neutrino research will continue to be fruitful .",
