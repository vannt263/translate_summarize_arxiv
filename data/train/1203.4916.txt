    "cluster synchronization , where certain clusters inside the network show isochronous synchronization , will be investigated in this paper .",
    "additionally , we describe the stability of group synchronization , i.e. , a generalization of cluster synchronization where the local dynamics of the nodes in each group differ",
    ".    the characterization of stability of isochronous synchronization has been widely studied , and the ground - breaking work by pecora and carroll @xcite which allows for a separation of network topology and local dynamics of the nodes was recently also applied to networks with delays in the links @xcite .",
    "such delay times can greatly change the synchronization properties and appear in many natural coupled systems .",
    "for example , in optical applications delay times arise from the finite speed of light and in neuronal networks delays play a role due to finite distances between interacting neurons , but also due to processing lags in the neurons .    for group and cluster synchronization , attempts have been made to treat stability within a master stability approach .",
    "sorrentino and ott @xcite considered two groups of nodes governed by different local dynamics . in the present paper , we show how this can be generalized to a higher number of groups and what restrictions for the topology of the network arise .",
    "moreover , our framework allows us to have multiple delay times in the network . making use of a separation of the topologies into multiple coupling matrices we can lift the restriction that no coupling may exist inside groups or clusters , i.e. , a restriction to multipartite topologies .",
    "this makes our theory accessible for a wide range of topologies .    after introducing the notion of cluster and group dynamics in sec .",

    "group synchronization describes a similar state of synchrony , but the node dynamics  determined by the functional form of the local dynamics",
    " differs from cluster to cluster .",
    "we refer to these clusters as _ groups_. as cluster synchronization is a special case of group synchronization , we use the more general notion of groups in the following .",

    "in general the dimension @xmath7 of the nodes @xmath8 may be different for each group @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , also the local dynamics @xmath9 can be different for each group , but must be identical for all nodes @xmath4 in a given group @xmath6 .",
    "for example , consider a network of neurons , where one group contains inhibitory neurons and another group contains excitatory ones .",
    "the local dynamics will be different for each group , and depending on the model used to describe both types of neurons also the dimension of the node dynamics may be different .",
    "let @xmath10 be the coupling strength for the coupling from the @xmath11-th to the @xmath6-th group .",
    "in the same sense , let @xmath12 be an @xmath13 coupling matrix , such that its entries @xmath14 represent the coupling of node @xmath15 ( which is in the @xmath11-th group ) to node @xmath16 ( which is in the @xmath6-th group ) .",
    "by this construction we obtain a multipartite topology in which one cluster has incoming links from only one neighbor while having outgoing links to another one .",

    "we apply our method to a neural network where the nodes are modeled as fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) systems . as in the last section we consider a network of two groups coupled via two coupling matrices @xmath109 ( intergroup coupling ) and @xmath111 ( intragroup coupling ) .",
    "we use a diffusive - like coupling . as discussed above this",
    "can be transformed to the coupling used in the previous sections by transforming the local dynamics of the @xmath16-th node in the @xmath6-th cluster as follows : @xmath165 with @xmath166 and @xmath160 . here",
    "@xmath167 and @xmath168 denote the activator and inhibitor variables , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath169 determines the threshold of excitability .",
    "a single fhn oscillator is excitable for @xmath170 and exhibits self - sustained periodic firing beyond the hopf bifurcation at @xmath171 .",
    "we will focus on the excitable regime with @xmath172 .",
    "the time - scale parameter @xmath173 is chosen as @xmath174 .",
    "the synchronized dynamics and the master stability equation are then given by eq .",
    "and eq .  , respectively .",
    "we assume the coupling scheme @xmath175 .",
    "the cluster synchronized dynamics is equivalent to a system of two coupled nodes with self - feedback . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that depending on the delay times , the coupling strength , and the strength of the self - feedback different dynamical scenarios , i.e. , in - phase synchronization , anti - phase synchronization , or bursting can arise .",
    "figure  [ fig : fhn ] shows the master stability function in panels ( a)-(c ) for in - phase synchronization , anti - phase synchronization and for synchronization in two bursting groups , respectively .",
    "the right hand panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fhn ] depict the corresponding time series : in panel ( d ) , ( f ) , and ( h ) for the activator variables and in panel ( e ) , ( g ) , and ( i ) for the inhibitor for in - phase , anti - phase , and bursting dynamics , respectively . because the different dynamical scenarios yield distinctively different stable regions , topologies might arise which show stable synchronization for one of the patterns but not for the others .",
    "however , for all scenarios the stable region contains the unity square , i.e. , @xmath176\\times [ -1,1]$ ] . with gershgorin",
    "s circle theorem @xcite it can easily be shown that the eigenvalues of symmetrical matrices with positive entries and unity row sum are always contained in the interval @xmath177 $ ] .",
    "thus , if @xmath109 and @xmath111 have only positive entries , i.e. , if the coupling is excitatory , synchronization is stable for the dynamics and parameters shown here . as a consequence ,",
    "only the introduction of inhibitory links can lead to desynchronization . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that for @xmath178 and @xmath179 this is the case for all @xmath180 and @xmath181 for which the synchronized dynamics is periodic .",
    "a detailed study of these phenomena for the eight - dimensional parameter space of @xmath182 ( @xmath183 ) is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "based on a master stability approach , we have studied patterns of cluster and group synchronization in delay - coupled networks and determined their stability . we have shown that the master stability function applied to cluster and group synchronization exhibits a discrete @xmath1-fold rotational symmetry for @xmath1 dynamical clusters .",
    "this reduces the numerical effort , such that for a larger number of clusters the master stability function must be evaluated only on a smaller angular sector in the complex plane . within our approach",
    "we can treat a wide range of multipartite network topologies . using multiple commuting coupling matrices",
    ", we have generalized our stability analysis beyond multipartite topologies , for instance towards hierarchical network structures . as concrete examples we have focused on delay - coupled lasers and neural networks .",
    "the interplay of complex topologies , multiple delay times , and possibly different local dynamics and different coupling functions extends the scope of the master stability framework and is a step towards understanding complex patterns of synchronization in real - world networks .",
    "this work was supported by dfg in the framework of sfb 910 .",
    "we investigate the eigenvalue spectrum of the coupling matrix @xmath195 @xmath64 has at least @xmath196 zero eigenvalues , where @xmath197 arises solely due to the block structure of @xmath64 : if all @xmath12 have maximum rank @xmath198 , there are exactly those @xmath196 zeros . in general , the exact number of zeros is given by @xmath199 , which may be larger than @xmath196 due to the particular structure of the @xmath12 .",
    "assume that the groups are arranged such that @xmath202 ( @xmath203 ) , which can always be achieved by an index permutation , and that each @xmath12 has maximum rank @xmath198 . then of the blocks in @xmath200 , @xmath204 has lowest rank , since it is an @xmath205 matrix .",
    "the non - zero eigenvalues of a matrix product are invariant against exchange of the factors , their number ( including degeneracy ) equals the rank of the product with lowest rank , i.e. , @xmath204 in our case . as a consequence , the non - zero eigenvalues of @xmath200 are given by the non - zero eigenvalues @xmath206 of @xmath204 .",
    "as there are @xmath1 blocks yielding exactly these eigenvalues , each of them is @xmath1-fold degenerate .",
    "in particular , since the row sum of @xmath200 is unity , there is an @xmath1-fold unity eigenvalue .",
    "the non - zero eigenvalues of @xmath64 are then given by the @xmath1-th roots of the non - zero eigenvalues of @xmath200 , and the whole spectrum @xmath207 of @xmath64 reads @xmath208{|\\lambda_1| } e^{[\\arg(\\lambda_1 ) + 2\\pi k ]        i / m},\\ldots\\\\    & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\ldots,\\sqrt[m]{|\\lambda_m| } e^{[\\arg(\\lambda_m ) +        2\\pi k ] i / m } \\}.",
