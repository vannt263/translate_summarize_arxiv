    "in the past two decades , a considerable progress has been made @xcite on understanding the phase structure of helfrich @xcite and polyakov - kleinert @xcite model , which is an elastic surface model with bending rigidity denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "the surface fluctuation can be viewed as a second order phase transition between the smooth phase at @xmath4 and the crumpled phase at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "numerical studies have also been concentrated on the phase transition @xcite .",
    "the scaling of the string tension @xmath6 was first investigated by ambjorn et .",
    "al @xcite .",
    "it has been recognized that @xmath6 vanishes at the critical point of the phase transition @xcite .",
    "the canonical monte carlo was used to extract information about @xmath6 .",
    "however , @xmath6 is originally defined in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to use grand canonical monte carlo simulations in order to see the scaling of @xmath6 more convincingly , although it has been demonstrated that the canonical mc can simulate the scaling of @xmath6@xcite .",
    "it was recently reported that the phase structure of the model depends on the choice of the integration measure @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the co - ordination number of the vertex @xmath9 @xcite . from a conformal field",
    "theoretical viewpoint , this @xmath10 is believed to be @xmath11 @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath12 is considered as a volume weight of the vertex @xmath9 in the integration @xmath13 .",
    "hence , it is possible to extend @xmath10 to continuous numbers by assuming that the weight can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to see the dependence of @xmath6 on the phase transitions which can be controlled by the parameter @xmath10 .    in this article",
    ", we would like to investigate the scaling property of @xmath6 .",
    "it will be confirmed by using the grand canonical mc that the string tension vanishes at the continuous transition .",
    "moreover , we would like to show a numerical evidence of the nonvanishing string tension in the smooth phase , which is distinguished from the wrinkled phase by the discontinuous transition at finite negative value of @xmath10 .",
    "we speculatively comment on why the result of nonvanishing string tension could be a relevant one .",
    "it is possible to consider that the nonvanishing string tension is connected to two interesting problems .",
    "the first is the problem of quark confinement , which is rather a problem in mathematical physics .",
    "the linear potential @xmath14 assumed between quark and anti - quark separated by the distance @xmath0 gives the finite string tension , which is compatible with our result of nonvanishing string tension .",
    "the second is the conversion of external forces into an internal energy and vice versa in real physical membranes , and is a rather practical problem .",
