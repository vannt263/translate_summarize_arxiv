    "we are mainly concerned with the stability and monotonicity @xcite of difference schemes for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws with source terms .",
    "such systems are used to describe many physical problems of great practical importance in magneto - hydrodynamics , kinetic theory of rarefied gases , linear and nonlinear waves , viscoelasticity , multi - phase flows and phase transitions , shallow waters , etc .",

    ", one is seeking to establish a numerical scheme that would be robust enough to eradicate spurious oscillations , i.e. a monotone scheme @xcite . at the present time",
    "there are several notions of scheme monotonicity .",
    "the notion of ` monotonicity preserving scheme ' originally appeared in godunov @xcite .",
    "such a scheme transforms a monotone increasing ( or decreasing ) function @xmath28 of space coordinate @xmath29 at a time level @xmath30 into a monotone increasing ( or decreasing , respectively ) function @xmath31 at the next time level @xmath32 .",
    "thus , with the use of a monotonicity preserving scheme , any discontinuity in the initial monotone data can be smeared in succeeding time steps but can not become oscillatory . nowadays monotonicity preserving schemes are also known as , e.g. , monotonicity conserving iterations ( or methods ) @xcite , monotone schemes ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , monotonicity preserving methods @xcite , and godunov - monotone schemes @xcite .",
    "harten et al .",
    "@xcite put forward their own definition of scheme monotonicity as follows : a difference scheme , @xmath33 , is said to be monotone if @xmath34 is a monotone increasing function of each of its arguments .",
    "the following definition is due to samarskiy : a scheme is regarded as monotone if the boundary maximum principle is maintained @xcite ( see also , e.g. , , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a difference scheme may also be referred to as monotone if a maximum principle , e.g. , the boundary maximum principle , the region maximum principle , the maximum principle for inverse column entries , the maximum principle for the absolute values , etc , holds for this scheme @xcite .",
    "a further important notion of difference scheme monotonicity was , in fact , done in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a scheme will be referred to as monotone if it is monotonicity preserving @xcite and transforms a `` @xmath35-function '' ( or `` @xmath36-function '' ) into a `` @xmath37 - function '' ( or into an `` @xmath38 - function '' , respectively ) .",
    "here and in what follows , a scalar grid function @xmath39 will be referred to as @xmath35-function ( or @xmath36-function ) if there exist grid nodes @xmath40 and @xmath41 such that @xmath42 ; @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the @xmath36-function ) if @xmath47 ; @xmath48 if @xmath49 ; @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 for the @xmath36-function ) if @xmath54",
    ". simply stated , the @xmath35-function ( or @xmath36-function ) is a scalar grid function @xmath55 that has only one generalized local maximum @xcite ( or generalized local minimum @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "the set of @xmath37-functions ( or @xmath38-functions ) is the union of @xmath35-functions ( @xmath36-functions , respectively ) and the set of monotone functions .",
    "hereinafter , for the sake of convenience , a monotonicity preserving scheme will be referred to as g - monotone for short , a scheme monotone in terms of harten et al .",
    "@xcite will be referred to as h - monotone , a scheme will be referred to as s - monotone if a maximum principle holds for this scheme ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and a scheme being monotone from the standpoint of ostapenko @xcite will be referred to as go - monotone @xcite .    for studying g - monotonicity of non - linear schemes the notion of total variation ( tv ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) turns out to be an useful tool , since any total variation diminishing ( tvd ) scheme is g - monotone @xcite , @xcite , .",
    "h - monotone as well as tvd schemes appear to be attractive for at least the following reasons : ( i ) h - monotone schemes are tvd @xcite and , hence , g - monotone @xcite ; ( ii ) any h - monotone scheme , being tvd , converges to the physically relevant solution , i.e. solutions of h - monotone schemes do satisfy the entropy condition @xcite , @xcite ; ( iii ) the notion of a tvd method is sufficient to prove convergence @xcite ; ( iv ) there exist simple sufficient conditions for a scalar scheme to be tvd @xcite . besides , it is widely believed that tvd methods are free from spurious oscillations ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) ; and thus , for the above - stated reasons , tvd schemes are in common practice ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "let us note that harten s theorem relative to g - monotonicity of h - monotone schemes ( i.e. , h - monotonicity @xmath56 tvd @xmath56 g - monotonicity ) was proven in @xcite for a specific class of schemes approximating a 1-d scalar partial differential equation ( pde ) , and hence it does not always happen that an h - monotone scheme is g - monotone .",
    "actually , let us consider the following linear scheme : @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 at @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , @xmath65 at @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath63 , @xmath69 .",
    "scheme ( [ in40 ] ) is h - monotone , since @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 . considering the monotone increasing function @xmath55 , namely @xmath76 for all @xmath77 and @xmath78 for all @xmath79",
    ", we obtain that @xmath80 for all @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 for all @xmath85 .",
    "we note that the grid function @xmath86 will not be monotone .",
    "thus , h - monotonicity is not sufficient as well as not necessary ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* example 4.2 ) ) condition for a scheme to be free of spurious oscillations .",
    "furthermore , as demonstrated in @xcite , a conservative scheme , h - monotone ( hence , consistent with the entropy condition @xcite ) , tvd ( hence , g - monotone @xcite ) , and s - monotone , be it non - linear @xcite or even linear with constant coefficients @xcite , can produce spurious oscillations comparable with the size of the jump - discontinuity ( cf .",
    "thus , the notions of tvd , s - monotonicity , and g - monotonicity are not sufficient for a numerical scheme to be non - oscillatory .",
    "as is shown in @xcite , the notion of go - monotonicity is a very helpful tool for the construction of non - oscillatory schemes .",
    "however , a go - monotone scheme can be not tvd @xcite and , hence , not s - monotone , since the notion tvd can be viewed as a concept within s - monotonicity @xcite .",
    "hence , if a numerical scheme will be go - monotone as well as s - monotone ( gos - monotone for short ) , then this scheme will be stable and , in general , free of spurious oscillations @xcite .    an approach to investigate non - linear difference schemes for s - monotonicity in terms of corresponding variational schemes",
    "was suggested in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the advantage of such an approach is that the variational scheme will always be linear and , hence , enables the investigation of the monotonicity for nonlinear operators using linear patterns .",
    "it is proven for the case of explicit schemes that the s - monotonicity of a variational scheme will guarantee that its original scheme will also be s - monotone @xcite .",
    "analogous theorem for the case of implicit schemes can be found in section [ non - linear schemes ] , theorem [ monotonicity due to variation ] .",
    "since a variational scheme carries such an important properties of its original scheme as s - monotonicity and go - monotonicity ( @xcite , see also section [ non - linear schemes ] , theorem [ monotonicity due to variation ] ) , the following definition will be useful in the investigation on scheme monotonicity .",
    "[ variational monotonicity]a numerical scheme is termed variationally monotone if its variational scheme is monotone .",
    "the notion of tv turns out to be an effective tool , @xcite , for studying the stability of non - linear schemes . actually , the following property @xmath87 is sufficient for stability of a two - step method @xcite , however it is , in general , difficult to obtain . here",
    "@xmath88 denotes the time increment , @xmath89 is a constant independent of @xmath88 as @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are any two grid functions ( @xmath92 will often be referred to as the variation of the grid function @xmath91 ) , @xmath93 denotes the scheme operator . at the same time , the stability of linearized version of the non - linear scheme is generally not sufficient to prove convergence @xcite , @xcite .",
    "instead , the tv - stability adopted in @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* s. 8.3.5 ) ) makes it possible to prove convergence ( to say , tv - convergence ) of non - linear scalar schemes with ease .",
    "however , the tvd property is a purely scalar notion that can not , in general , be extended for non - linear systems of equations , as the true solution itself is usually not tvd @xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover , one can see in @xcite that a tvd scheme can be non - convergent in , at least , @xmath94 , in spite that the scheme is tv - stable ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 12.2 ) ) .",
    "such a phenomenon is caused by the fact that tv is not a norm , but a semi - norm .",
    "nowadays , there exists a few methods for stability analysis of some classes of nonlinear difference schemes approximating systems of pdes ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is noted in @xcite that the problem of stability analysis is still one of the most burning problems , because of the absence of its complete solution .",
    "in particular , as noted in @xcite in this connection , the vast majority of difference schemes , currently in use , have still not been analyzed .",
    "leveque @xcite noted as well that , in general , no numerical method for non - linear systems of equations has been proven to be stable .",
    "there is not even a proof that the first - order godunov method converges on general systems of non - linear conservation laws @xcite .",
    "thus , a different approach to testing scheme stability must be adopted to prove convergence of non - linear schemes for systems of pdes .",
    "the notion of scheme in variations ( or variational scheme @xcite , @xcite ) has , in all likelihood , much potential to be an effective tool for studying stability of nonlinear schemes .",
    "such an approach goes back to the one suggested by lyapunov ( 1892 ) , namely , to investigate stability by the first approximation .",
    "this idea has long been exploited for investigation of the stability of motion @xcite ) as well as the stability of difference equations @xcite .",
    "we establish the notion that the stability of a scheme in variations implies the stability of its original scheme ( see section [ non - linear schemes ] , theorem [ linear - nonlinear stability ] and remark [ linear - nonlinear implicit stability ] ) .    aiming to demonstrate potentialities such notions as ` variational scheme ' and ` gos - monotonicity ' in construction numerical schemes",
    ", we will develop a novel version of the central lax - friedrichs ( lxf ) scheme ( e.g. , ) with second - order accuracy in space and time .",
    "the stability of this scheme is proven in section [ second - order central schemes ] .",
    "we restrict our proof mainly to the case when the solutions to ( [ ina10 ] ) are smooth .",
    "notice , such a property as smoothness is peculiar not only to vanishing - viscosity ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) solutions of a hyperbolic system . since the stiffness parameter , @xmath95 , in the system ( [ ina10 ] ) is like a viscosity @xcite , a solution to the system of conservation laws ( [ ina10 ] ) is expected to be smooth provided that input data are sufficiently smooth .",
    "this specific type of systems is interesting itself , as such systems are not uncommon in practice . for a detailed discussion on this subject , including the sufficient conditions for the global existence of smooth solutions , see @xcite .",
    "an extensive literature is devoted to central schemes , since these schemes are attractive for various reasons : no riemann solvers , characteristic decompositions , complicated flux splittings , etc .",
    ", must be involved in construction of a central scheme ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , and hence such schemes can be implemented as a black - box solvers for general systems of conservation laws @xcite .",
    "let us , however , note that the numerical domain of dependence @xcite for a central scheme approximating , e.g. , a scalar transport equation coincides with the numerical domain of dependence for a standard explicit scheme approximating diffusion equations @xcite .",
    "such a property is inherent to central schemes in contrast to , e.g. , the first - order upwind schemes @xcite .",
    "hence , central schemes do not satisfy the long known principle ( e.g. , @xcite ) that derivatives must be correctly treated using type - dependent differences , and hence there is a risk for every central scheme to exhibit spurious solutions .",
    "the results of simulations in @xcite can be seen as an illustration of the last assertion .",
    "notice , all versions of the , so called , nessyahu - tadmor ( nt ) central scheme , in spite of sufficiently small cfl number ( @xmath96 ) , exhibit spurious oscillations in contrast to the second - order upwind scheme ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the first order lxf scheme exhibits the excessive numerical viscosity .",
    "thus , the central scheme should be chosen with great care to reflect the true solution and to avoid significant but spurious peculiarities in numerical solutions .",
    "let us note that lxf scheme ",
    "the forerunner for central schemes @xcite , @xcite  does not produce spurious oscillations . while , from the pioneering works of nessyahu and tadmor @xcite and on , the higher order versions of lxf scheme can produce spurious oscillations .",
    "the reason has to do with a negative numerical viscosity introduced to obtain a higher order accurate scheme .",
    "let us illustrate it with the scheme ( 135 ) in @xcite , which is @xmath98 accurate .",
    "we rewrite this scheme to read @xmath99 @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes the derivative of the interpolant at @xmath102 .",
    "notice , the second term in the right - hand side of ( [ ina30 ] ) is , in fact , the negative numerical viscosity . without this term , scheme ( [ ina30 ] ) would be of the first order , namely lxf scheme .",
    "let us note that there is a possibility to increase the scheme s order of accuracy , up to @xmath103 , by introducing into scheme ( [ ina30 ] ) an additional non - negative numerical viscosity .",
    "such an approach is similar to the vanishing viscosity method @xcite , @xcite , and hence possesses its advantages , yet it appears to be free of the disadvantages of this method , since the additional viscosity term is not artificial . with this approach ,",
    "the second order scheme is developed in section [ second - order central schemes ] , where sufficient conditions for stability as well as a necessary condition for s - monotonicity of the scheme are found .",
    "the developed scheme is tested on several conservation laws in section [ exemplification and discussion ] .",
    "a stable numerical scheme may yield spurious results when applied to a stiff hyperbolic system with relaxation ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . specifically",
    ", spurious numerical solution phenomena may occur when underresolved numerical schemes ( i.e. , insufficient spatial and temporal resolution ) are used ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , during a computation , the stiffness parameter may be very small , and , hence , to resolve the small stiffness parameter , we need a huge number of time and spatial increments , making the computation impractical .",
    "hence , we are interested to solve the system , ( [ ina10 ] ) , with underresolved numerical schemes .",
    "it is significant that for relaxation systems a numerical scheme must possess a discrete analogy to the continuous asymptotic limit , because any scheme violating the correct asymptotic limit leads to spurious or poor solutions ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "most methods for solving such systems can be described as operator splitting ones , @xcite , or methods of fractional steps , @xcite .",
    "after operator splitting , one solves the advection homogeneous system , and then the ordinary differential equations associated with the source terms . as reported in @xcite , this approach is well suited for the stiff systems",
    ". let us however note that the schemes based on the operator - splitting techniques are of the first order in time , excluding rare cases such as , e.g. , the strang splitting @xcite .",
    "thus , following pareschi @xcite , we conclude that such schemes are , in general , not robust . fortunately , as applied to system ( [ ina10 ] ) , the second order schemes can be constructed on the basis of operator - splitting techniques with ease .",
    "we are mainly concerned with such an approach in section [ sosost ] .",
