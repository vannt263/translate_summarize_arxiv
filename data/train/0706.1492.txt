    "several hypotheses , mostly based on the properties of trehalose - high solubility , low reactivity , good glass - forming and antioxydant properties , etc . - have been proposed to explain why it is the most effective bioprotectant among sugars and polyols  @xcite .",

    "this figure was generated using vmd  @xcite ( http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/research/vmd/).,width=272 ]    in aqueous solutions proteins may be thermodynamically stabilized by the _ preferential exclusion _ of cosolvent molecules from the protein / solvent interface , which make thermodynamically unfavorable the increase of the solvent accessible surface area ( sasa ) of proteins upon denaturation  @xcite .",
    "this exclusion could arise from excluded volume effects and an increase in the surface tension of water induced by solutes  @xcite .",
    "this may explain why among many solutes trehalose was found to be the most excluded  @xcite , given its larger hydration number in comparison to other disaccharides such as maltose and sucrose  @xcite ( the structures of these sugars are shown in figures  [ sugars]b and c , respectively ) .",
    "moreover , solutes may hinder the formation of ice , which is generally lethal to organisms .",
    "et al . _ have suggested that trehalose would be more effective in inhibiting ice formation than other disaccharides , because it binds to a larger number of water molecules and would therefore have a greater _ destructuring effect _  @xcite .    at high temperatures or high osmotic pressures ,",

    "biological molecules may experience important stresses when _ hydration _ water molecules are removed  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the addition of stabilizing solutes may be two - fold .",

    "the glass formed may kinetically maintain the conformation of proteins and prevent the fusion of membranes .",
    "trehalose would then be a better bioprotectant than maltose or sucrose given its higher glass transition temperature @xmath2 , as suggested by green and angell  @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is generally well accepted , even though counter - examples have been reported  @xcite .",
    "the second effect of an increase of the concentration of stabilizing solutes upon dehydration is the formation of hydrogen bonds ( hbs ) between solutes and biological molecules .",

    "nevertheless , both appear necessary to achieve long - term preservation  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , belton and gil have suggested that the direct interaction of the solute glassy matrix with lysozyme is relatively limited , because the hydration water is trapped in an amorphous state ( non - crystalline ice ) by the solute glassy matrix  @xcite .",
    "the role of trehalose would be to concentrate residual water molecules close to the protein .",

    "many simulation studies of ternary systems have been published in the last few years  @xcite .",

    "they have suggested that the presence of lysozyme induces an aggregation of trehalose molecules , which trap a thin layer at the protein surface , in agreement with the suggestion of belton and gil  @xcite for solid lysozyme / trehalose / water samples .",
    "similarly , cottone  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that trehalose is preferentially excluded from the protein surface at 50 and 89 wt % .",

    "i.e. _ high enough so that the solvent structure and dynamics are quite different from those of pure water , but low enough to allow relatively large - scale motions of protein surface atoms",
    ". this concentration range is particularly important since it may link the protein properties in dilute solutions to those in solid matrices .",
    "for this purpose , we have probed the influence on some structural and dynamical properties of hen egg - white lysozyme , a model globular protein , of three well - known homologous disaccharides , namely trehalose [ @xmath4-d - glucopyranosyl-@xmath4-d - glucopyranoside ] , maltose [ 4-o-(@xmath4-d - glucopyranosyl)-@xmath1-d - glucopyranoside ] and sucrose [ @xmath1-d - fructofuranosyl-@xmath4-d - glucopyranoside ] ( see figure  [ sugars ] ) , in the 37 - 60 wt  % concentration range by means of molecular dynamics computer simulations .",
    "this specific concentration range was chosen because it corresponds to the range of concentrations where the hb network of the present sugars was shown to percolate in our previous numerical study of disaccharide / water solutions  @xcite .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations of hen egg - white lysozyme ( hereafter referred to as lysozyme ) in sugar / water solutions have been performed using the charmm program  @xcite , version 29b1 .",
    "the all - atom charmm22 force field  @xcite has been used to model the protein .",
    "the csff carbohydrate force field  @xcite has been considered for disaccharides and water molecules were represented by the spc / e model  @xcite .",
    "the production simulations were performed in the isochoric - isothermal ( n , v , t ) ensemble .",
    "the length of all covalent bonds involving an hydrogen atom as well as the geometry of water molecules were kept fixed using the shake algorithm  @xcite , with a relative tolerance of 10@xmath6 .",
    "a 2-fs timestep has been used to integrate the equations of motion with the verlet leapfrog algorithm  @xcite .    during the different stages of the simulations ,",
    "the temperatures have been maintained constant with weak coupling to a heat bath ( berendsen thermostat  @xcite ) with a relaxation time of 0.2 ps . a cutoff radius of 10   has been used to account for van der waals interactions , which were switched to zero between 8 and 10   .",

    "the starting structure of lysozyme was obtained from the x - ray crystal structure solved at 1.33   ( 193l entry of the brookhaven protein data bank )  @xcite .",
    "most probable charge states at ph 7 were chosen for ionizable residues .",
    "the total charge of lysozyme ( + 8 @xmath10 ) was then neutralized by uniformly rescaling the charge of protein atoms , similarly to ref .",
    "the disaccharide initial conformations have been deduced from neutron and x - ray studies of trehalose  @xcite , maltose  @xcite and sucrose  @xcite .",
    "the sugar concentrations on a protein - free basis are 37 , 50 and 60 wt % .",
    "these concentrations have been purposefully chosen based on our previous study of sugar / water solutions  @xcite .",
    "indeed , we showed that the relative effect of sugars on water may be distinguished above a threshold concentration of about 40 wt% .",
    "therefore , their relative influence on lysozyme at ambient temperature may be characterized above this concentration .",
    "lysozyme and its 142 crystallographic hydration water molecules were first placed in an orthorhombic box with cell parameters a = b = 46.7   and c = 62.2  .",
    "then , disaccharide molecules were located and oriented randomly around lysozyme , with minimum sugar - protein and sugar - sugar distance criteria , which ensure an isotropic distribution of sugars around lysozyme .",
    "finally , water molecules non - overlapping with either lysozyme or sugars were randomly added in the simulation box .",
    "initial configurations were minimized in three steps , keeping first lysozyme and sugars fixed , then keeping only lysozyme fixed and finally keeping free all molecules .",
    "this minimized configuration was heated to 473 k in the canonic ensemble during 1 to 3 ns , while maintaining fixed the conformation of lysozyme to prevent conformational changes .",
    "this aimed at equilibrating solvent configurations , particularly the position and orientation of sugars .",
    "then , the resulting configurations were thermalized at 300k and simulated in the isobaric - isothermal ( n , p , t ) ensemble .",
    "the stabilized volume of the simulation box during this simulation was considered to compute the averaged density of the system and used to perform the subsequent simulations in the ( n , v , t ) ensemble . a steepest - descent minimization procedure of 1000 iterations",
    "was then performed , whilst applying a decreasing harmonic potential on atoms of lysozyme .",
    "after the minimization procedure , the temperature was raised from 0 to 300 k , with a 5-k temperature increase every 250 steps .",
    "then , an equilibration at 300 k was performed during about 80 ps .",
    "finally , simulations of 10 , 12 and 17 ns were performed for the sytems at concentrations of 37 , 50 and 60 wt % , respectively , and configurations were saved every 0.25 ps .",
    "a control simulation of lysozyme in pure water was done in an analogous way as the one described above . in this simulation",
    ", the orthorhombic box was directly filled with water molecules . moreover , this system was not heated at 473 k , since water molecules are much more mobile than sugars .",
    "the first two and four ns were not considered to compute the structural and dynamical properties presented in this paper for the 0 - 50 and 60 wt % systems , respectively .",
    "table  [ table1 ] summarizes some simulation data for the different systems considered in the present study .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      solvent molecules do not form hbs with apolar groups of lysozyme . therefore , the number of protein - solvent hbs does not describe exhaustively protein - solvent interactions .",
    "we have thus characterized the relative local distribution of water molecules around lysozyme in a similar way to cottone  _ et al . _",
    "we have indeed computed the time - averaged normalized ratio @xmath11=@xmath12(r)/(@xmath13 ) , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the local numbers of water oxygen atoms and sugar hydroxyl group oxygens , respectively , located at a minimum distance @xmath16 from any heavy atom of lysozyme , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the total numbers of water oxygen atoms and sugar hydroxyl group oxygen atoms , respectively , in the simulation box . this ratio is greater than one in the close proximity of the protein surface if a given sugar is preferentially excluded from the protein surface ( in other words , if the protein is preferentially hydrated ) .",
    "conversely , the sugar preferentially interacts with the protein if this ratio is lower than one .",
    "this ratio is represented in the figure  [ gr ] for the different ternary studied systems .",
    "lysozyme clearly appears more and more preferentially hydrated when increasing sugar concentration . at distances larger than @xmath9 5 ",
    "there is a slight water depletion which results from the presence of sugars .",
    "this preferential hydration probably arise from excluded volume effects and is consistent with the relatively low proportion of sugar - lysozyme hbs relative to water - lysozyme hbs ( see table  [ hbs ] ) .",
    "this may confirm that sugars are good protein stabilizers in the framework of the preferential hydration hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "if we exclude the sucrose solution at 50 wt % , for which there may be shortcomings , we note that trehalose preferentially hydrates lysozyme slightly more than do maltose and sucrose .",
    "this seems to be especially true for the hydration of apolar groups of lysozyme , which is apparent in the small peak located around 3.7   .",
    "trehalose hydroxyl oxygens were indeed systematically more excluded from these groups than those of maltose and sucrose ( data not shown ) .",
    "this may arise from the larger hydration number of trehalose ( see figure  [ cluster]a ) , which would prevent it from remaining close to apolar groups of lysozyme .",
    "cottone  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have also shown that sucrose and trehalose at a concentration of 89 wt % preferentially hydrate carboxy - myoglobin ( mbco ) , but sucrose to a larger extent than trehalose .",
    "it is possible that the effect of trehalose is somewhat different at this much more elevated concentration , as exemplified by the differences between the water replacement  @xcite and the preferential hydration  @xcite hypotheses",
    ".     normalized fraction of water oxygen atoms @xmath11=@xmath12/(@xmath13 ) as a function of the minimal distance to any heavy atom from lysozyme .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the local numbers of water and sugar hydroxyl oxygen atoms , respectively . @xmath17 and @xmath18 correspond to the total numbers of water and sugar hydroxyl oxygen atoms found in the simulation box , respectively.,width=272 ]      an important issue of the bioprotection phenomenon involves the role of sugar - water interactions . indeed , the stabilizing effect of solutes is sometimes thougth to depend directly on their effect on the hb network of water",
    ", although this is controversed  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the larger hydration number of trehalose compared to maltose and sucrose  @xcite may explain its enhanced stabilizing effect .",
    "in the present solutions , the interaction of sugars with water molecules is rather analogous to that of binary water / sugar solutions  @xcite .",
    "first , the figure  [ cluster]a reveals that the hydration numbers of sugars are lower than in our previous simulation study of binary sugar / water mixtures  @xcite , even if we exclude the sugars hydrogen bonded to lysozyme ( data not shown ) .",
    "the analysis of additional simulations of dilute binary sugar / water solutions at a concentration of 4 wt % ( 1 sugar with 512 water molecules ) using the csff carbohydrate force field  @xcite suggests that the observed differences between binary and ternary solutions do not arise from the different force fields , ha  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and csff  @xcite , used for representing sugars in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the present study , respectively .",
    "it could thus rather be attributed to the preferential exclusion of sugars , which raises their concentrations within their corresponding accessible volumes , thus reducing their hydration numbers .",
    "trehalose is found to have a slightly larger hydration number than maltose and sucrose , with the exception of the 60 wt % solution , where it is found slightly less hydrated than maltose , as shown in the figure  [ cluster]a .",
    "it is possible that the hydration behavior of sugars in ternary solutions can not be perfectly extrapolated from that in binary aqueous solutions , because there should exist for sugars at high concentrations a compromise between having a large hydration number and being highly preferentially excluded from the protein surface .",
    "secondly , the numbers of sugar intramolecular hbs , shown in figure  [ cluster]b , are also in qualitative agreement with our previous study  : trehalose is found to form a lower number of intramolecular hbs than does sucrose , maltose being intermediate , whatever the concentration considered .",
    "this would explain why the hydration number of trehalose is slightly larger than those of maltose and sucrose , since hydroxyl groups involved in these hbs no longer remain available for interacting with water molecules .",
    "these numbers definitely depend on the force field used and are systematically found lower in the present study .",
    "this is consistent with the larger radii of gyration of sugars with the csff force field  @xcite ( 3.49  , 3.52  , 3.41   for t , m , s , respectively ) than with the ha  _ et al .",
    "_ force field  @xcite ( 3.40  , 3.46  , 3.30   for t , m , s , respectively ) in the dilute binary solutions ( 4 wt % ) .",
    "this result suggests that sugar conformations are sligthly more extended and that their rings are slightly further from each other with the csff force field .",
    "moreover , the sasas of sugars computed according to the lee and richards method  @xcite with a probe radius of 1.4   are shown in figure  [ cluster]c .",
    "the sasa of trehalose is found larger than that of sucrose , that of maltose being intermediate .",
    "this property may explain why trehalose interacts more with water than do maltose and sucrose  @xcite .",
    "besides , the presence of a furanose ring in sucrose ( see figure  [ sugars ] ) probably explain why several of its properties differ from those of maltose and trehalose .    finally , the percolation of the hb network of sugars was suggested to play a major role in the bioprotection phenomenon , and differences between the three sugars have been observed  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true for sugar concentrations above 50 wt % , where sugar - sugar interactions become important .",
    "the normalized mean sugar cluster size @xmath19 has been computed in the same way as in our previous work  @xcite to know if the percolation of the sugar hb network occurs in the same concentration range in presence of the protein .",
    "these sizes are presented in the figure  [ cluster]d .",
    "a transition clearly appears in the [ 37 - 50 ] wt % concentration interval and the hb network of sugars has almost completely percolated at 60 wt % , in good agreement with our previous results  @xcite .",
    "sucrose on one hand and maltose and trehalose on the other hand show quite different behaviors .",
    "indeed , the percolation transition in sucrose systems is shifted to higher concentrations compared to maltose and trehalose ones . in other words , a higher concentration of sucrose is needed to reach a given cluster size @xmath20 .",
    "this is well in line with the higher number of intramolecular hbs in sucrose ( see figure  [ cluster]b ) , as well as its slightly lower accessible surface area due to the presence of a furanose ring ( see figure  [ cluster]c ) .",
    "this behavior may then explain why the dynamics of lysozyme is less modified by the presence of sucrose than by the presence of maltose or trehalose , as shown in the section  [ dynamics ] .",
    "furthermore , trehalose and maltose , which are topologically closer to each other than to sucrose ( see figure  [ sugars ] ) , behave in a similar way .",
    "nonetheless , it seems that the hb network of maltose tends to percolate at a lower sugar concentration than that of trehalose , as observed previously  @xcite .",
    "this may originate both from the less symmetric conformation of maltose and from its lower affinity for water molecules . in our previous study ,",
    "maltose formed systematically larger clusters than trehalose , whereas this not always remains true in the present study .",
    "this difference may originate from the presence of the protein , with which maltose seems to interact more strongly than trehalose does and thus less with other maltose molecules .",
    "interestingly , the mean sugar cluster sizes @xmath19 seem to be consistent with the solubility of the three disaccharides .",
    "indeed , the experimental solubility at room temperature of sucrose is significantly larger than that of trehalose , whereas the solubility of maltose is slightly lower than that of trehalose ( see fig . 4 of ref  @xcite ) .",
    "recently , giuffrida  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have suggested that this enhanced tendency of maltose molecules to form clusters could be related to their larger dipole momentum .",
    "indeed , from ab initio calculations at the blyp/6 - 31 g * * level , they obtained values of 5.2 , 2.5 and 1.5 debyes for the crystallographic structures of maltose , sucrose , and trehalose , respectively .",

    "it is well known that proteins exhibit extremely diverse motions ( from local atomic to subunit motions ) which occur on time scales that span many orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "the broad distribution of the msfs and of the @xmath23 of lysozyme residues actually suggest that their structural relaxations are very heterogeneous , and thus that lysozyme dynamics is complex . a recent study of hydrated lysozyme ( @xmath24 = 0.43 ) indeed shows that the distribution of the effective rotational correlation times of methyl groups is very broad  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the effect of sugars on the msfs of lysozyme suggest that they slow down its diffusive motions",
    ". this would imply that they make lysozyme less sensitive to high temperatures by preventing large - scale motions that might lead to denaturation . in order to get a deeper insight into the influence of sugars on the relaxational behavior of lysozyme , we have computed incoherent intermediate scattering functions @xmath25 for each residue of lysozyme .",

    "these functions represent the time fourier transform of dynamic structure factors @xmath29 , obtained in neutron scattering experiments .",
    "we have chosen to probe the dynamics of lysozyme at a wavevector of 2.29 @xmath8 , which corresponds to the position of the first peak in the static structure factor @xmath30 of pure water and which was used in our study of binary sugar / water solutions  @xcite .",
    "characteristic relaxation times @xmath31 may then be defined as the decay times from 1 to 1/@xmath10 of the different @xmath25 .",
    "the figure  [ taures ] shows the relaxation frequencies 1/@xmath31 of residues of lysozyme in pure water and in the different trehalose solutions .",
    "these frequencies clearly appear diverse and , similarly to msfs , they seem to follow the fractional solvent accessibilies @xmath23 of residues of lysozyme ( see figure  [ fsares ] ) , since residues which are more exposed to the solvent relax faster than those which are buried in the protein _ core_.    the addition of sugars at the studied concentrations induces a strong reduction of the relaxation frequency of lysozyme residues .",
    "this slowing - down of the dynamics of lysozyme evidences that the higher the solvent viscosity , the lower the diffusive ( or @xmath4-like ) motions of lysozyme , in the studied concentration range .",
    "this would confirm the basic assumption that the structural or @xmath4 relaxation of the solvent - which is related to its viscosity - determines the influence of the solvent on the dynamics of proteins  @xcite .",

    ", width=272 ]    the dynamical slowing - down induced by sugars is more visible in the figure  [ taures2]a , which shows the probability distribution functions of the relaxation times @xmath31 of lysozyme residues in the pure water and in trehalose solutions ( the distribution functions for maltose and sucrose solutions exhibit comparable behaviors and are not shown for clarity reasons ) . a significant shift towards larger relaxation times as well as a broadening of distributions",
    "are observed when the sugar concentration increases .",
    "this may reflect the broadening of the energy barriers experienced by lysozyme residues resulting from an increased dynamical coupling between the solvent and the protein .",
    "furthermore , the correlation between @xmath23 and relaxation times @xmath31 remains relatively well established at the highest studied concentration ( 60 wt % ) , as shown in figure  [ taures2]b , where is represented the mean relaxation time of lysozyme residues as a function of their fractional accessible surface area @xmath23 , for @xmath23 up to of about 0.6 ( given the low number of residues with a @xmath23 larger than 0.6 as shown in figure  [ fsares ] , the related statistical errors are very large ) .",
    "this figure shows that sugars influence both the dynamics of _ core _ and _ surface _ residues .",
    "it seems therefore possible to modulate the internal dynamics of proteins by changing the solvent viscosity with the addition of sugars .",

    "therefore , a straigthforward comparison between sugars is possible by considering the mean relaxation time of the whole lysozyme .",
    "the mean relaxation times of sugar and water molecules have also been computed to interpret the effect of sugars on lysozyme and solvent dynamics .",
    "the figure  [ taudecomp ] shows that the dependences on the disaccharide concentration of the mean relaxation times of lysozyme , sugars and water molecules exhibit a similar slope change at a concentration close to 50 w % .",
    "this may be interpreted when considering the percolations of the sugar hb networks , which occur at a concentration of about 40 - 50 wt % in both the sugar binary  @xcite and ternary solutions ( see figure  [ cluster]d ) . at these relatively high concentrations , the hydration layers of sugars",
    "do not surround completely disaccharides because of sugar - sugar hbs , which strongly influence their dynamics .",
    "these dynamical changes have been observed experimentally by rampp  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for a series of carbohydrates - including sucrose and trehalose - at concentrations above 50 wt % .",
    "they also appear in the concentration dependences of the diffusion coefficient of sucrose and trehalose in aqueous solutions obtained by ekdawi - sever  _ et al .",
    "_ by nmr measurements  @xcite .",
    "sugar - sugar interactions are not large enough at 37 wt % for detecting significant differences between sugar solutions .",
    "but at 50 wt % , the hb network of maltose and trehalose is more developed than that of sucrose , so that each species relaxes more slowly in the maltose and the trehalose solutions than in the sucrose one .",
    "finally , the hb network of sugars has almost percolated in the 60 wt % solutions .",
    "their dynamics are then dominated by the relaxation of the hb network of sugars and differences among sugars emerge .",
    "sucrose clearly relaxes faster than trehalose and maltose , due to its lower ability to form clusters .",
    "this is well in line with experimental studies , which show that the dynamics of sucrose is faster than that of maltose and trehalose  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the relaxation times of maltose seem to be somewhat longer than those of trehalose .",
    "this appears consistent with the lower heat capacity at constant pressure @xmath32 of the ternary lysozyme / maltose / water solution at 40 wt % in comparison with the corresponding sucrose and trehalose solutions  @xcite , which suggests that the ternary maltose solution is more viscous .",
    "this result also seems to confirm the _ peculiar behavior _ of maltose observed by giuffrida  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where the matrix dynamics was found the most reduced in the _ dry _ maltose sample .",
    "experimental measurements suggest that binary trehalose / water solutions are sligthly more viscous than maltose ones  @xcite .",

    "@xcite ) , which may arise from ( i ) the roughness of the protein surface , ( ii ) a decrease of the dimensionality of the solvent diffusion at the protein - solvent interface and ( iii ) strong solvent - protein interactions with polar and charged groups of the protein . given that the conformation of lysozyme is similar in trehalose and maltose solutions , the stronger interaction of maltose with lysozyme ( see table  [ hbs ] ) may imply that its dynamics is more slowed down than that of trehalose .",
    "furthermore , a direct comparison between the expected biopreservative efficiencies of the three studied carbohydrates in the light of the present results is not straightforward since maltose is a reducing sugar , unlike trehalose and sucrose .",
    "it may thus react with lysine and arginine residues of lysozyme and other proteins to form carbohydrate adducts , especially at high temperatures , via a complex browning pathway called maillard reaction  @xcite ( which can not occur in md simulations ) .",
    "this may explain why maltose is rarely used experimentally for protein stabilization , in contrast to trehalose and sucrose , which are natural bioprotectants .",
    "maltose was actually found to induce the smallest shift of the denaturation temperature @xmath33 of lysozyme at a concentration of 40 wt % , as measured in modulated differential scanning calorimetry and raman scattering investigations  @xcite .",
    "in addition , figure  [ taudecomp ] reveals that the protein , sugar and water dynamics are slower in the trehalose solutions than in the sucrose solutions for concentrations above 40 - 50 wt % .",
    "these results are in agreement with the tighter coupling of carboxy - myoglobin ( mbco ) with trehalose - water matrices than with sucrose - water matrices observed experimentally by giuffrida  _ et al .",
    "_ by means of fourier transform infrared ( ftir ) measurements  @xcite .",
    "this enhanced slowing - down presumably arises from the larger sugar - sugar interactions in the trehalose solutions at these concentrations , as seen in figure  [ cluster]d .",
    "moreover , the larger hydration number of trehalose compared to sucrose allows a more important dynamical coupling with water molecules .",
    "therefore , trehalose would have a better preservation efficiency because of the quasi - absence of intramolecular hbs in its solution conformation ( see figure  [ cluster]b ) , which allows it to interact more strongly with both water and sugar molecules than sucrose does . on the other hand , this would explain its higher solubility than ( true ) maltose  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the greater _ homogeneity _",
    "@xcite of intermolecular interactions in the trehalose solutions ( water - trehalose and trehalose - trehalose ) might lead to their better preservation efficiency .",
    "this may explain why trehalose was found to induce the largest shift of @xmath33 and to increase the most the temperature interval of the denaturation process @xmath34 of lysozyme  @xcite .",
    "the shift of @xmath33 was indeed found to be of 9.4@xmath350.3 k , 4.2@xmath350.3 k and 2.9@xmath350.3 k in the trehalose , sucrose and maltose solutions , respectively , by raman scattering .",
    "similarly , the temperature domain @xmath34 of the denaturation process was extended by 0.9@xmath350.2 k , 0.4@xmath350.2 k and 0.5@xmath350.2 k in the trehalose , sucrose and maltose solutions , respectively ( see table 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "finally , it must be pointed out that the slowing - down of lysozyme dynamics follows the slowing - down of the solvent induced by the percolation of the sugar hb network , but not necessarily the number of lysozyme - sugar hbs .",
    "indeed , sucrose forms at 60 wt % a larger number of hbs with lysozyme than trehalose , but lysozyme relaxes faster in the sucrose solution .",
    "this would imply that the slowing - down of the solvent plays a more important role on the dynamics of lysozyme than specific sugar - lysozyme hb interactions in the studied concentration range .",
    "if we only compare trehalose and sucrose , this suggests that the hypothesis of green and angell  @xcite , as well as the preferential hydration hypothesis  @xcite might be valid for this kind of solutions . in presence of sugars ,",
    "the unfolding process would require a reorganization of the hb network of sugars , easier in the sucrose solutions than in the trehalose ones .",
    "mean relaxation times @xmath31 of lysozyme ( top ) , disaccharides ( middle ) and water ( bottom ) as a function of the disaccharide concentration.,width=272 ]",
    "this article reports the results from molecular dynamics simulations of lysozyme / disaccharide / water solutions for intermediate concentrations of disaccharides ( 37 - 60 wt % on a protein - free basis ) .",
    "this concentration range was chosen because it corresponds to the range of concentrations where the hb network of sugars was shown to percolate in our previous study of disaccharide / water solutions  @xcite .",
    "several parameters of lysozyme like its root - mean - square deviations ( rmsd ) from the crystallographic structure , its radius of gyration and its sasa indicate that its conformation in presence of sugars remains very similar to that in pure water .",
    "nevertheless , structural fluctuations of lysozyme as seen from mean - square fluctuations ( msfs ) are much reduced in presence of sugars .",
    "this reduction was shown to be quite homogeneous throughout the protein and follows the fractional solvent accessibilities @xmath23 of lysozyme residues .",
    "this points out the influence of the solvent on the internal dynamics of lysozyme .",
    "the analysis of the interactions of sugars with lysozyme via hbs as well as the relative concentration of water oxygen atoms around lysozyme suggest that lysozyme is preferentially hydrated , well in line with other studies  @xcite .",
    "when comparing the three sugars , it seems that trehalose is slightly more excluded than maltose and sucrose , although the observed differences may be not significant .",
    "this could be interpreted by the larger hydration number of trehalose compared to that of maltose and sucrose  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the number of intramolecular hbs of trehalose was found lower than that of maltose and sucrose .",
    "interestingly , trehalose was also found to have the largest sasa .",
    "this may explain why it interacts more with water than maltose and sucrose .",
    "in addition , the hb network of sugars was shown to percolate in the studied concentration range .",
    "sucrose forms smaller clusters than trehalose and maltose , probably because of its larger number of intramolecular hbs .",
    "dynamical properties of lysozyme have been analyzed via incoherent intermediate scattering functions @xmath25 .",
    "the relaxation times of lysozyme residues mimic both msfs and @xmath23 distributions and a broadening of the distributions of relaxation times of lysozyme residues is observed when increasing sugar concentration .",
    "this could reveal an enhanced dynamical coupling between solvent and lysozyme .",
    "moreover , a similar increase of lysozyme , sugar and water relaxation times is observed when increasing the sugar concentration from 37 to 60 wt % and may arise from the percolation of the hb network of sugars , as suggested from our previous results on binary sugar / water solutions  @xcite .",
    "since sucrose forms smaller clusters than trehalose and maltose , it appears to slow down the dynamics of lysozyme less strongly at concentrations above @xmath9 40 - 50 wt % .",
    "this appears consistent with experimental results , which sugggest a looser protein - solvent coupling in sucrose - water matrices than in trehalose - water matrices of various water contents  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , maltose slows down more efficiently the dynamics of lysozyme because it forms larger clusters and interacts more strongly with lysozyme than trehalose .",
    "this seems consistent with the lower heat capacity at constant pressure @xmath32 of lysozyme / maltose / water solutions at 40 wt % compared to that of trehalose and sucrose solutions  @xcite and with the _ peculiar behavior _ of maltose observed experimentally by giuffrida  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "our simulations only cover a limited concentration range of disaccharides at ambient temperature ( 300 k ) , so that lysozyme is not submitted to temperature and/or desiccation stresses .",
    "furthermore , the length of simulations is too short to account for phenonema which occur on much longer time scales in real systems , such as vitrification , ice formation or sugar crystalline phase transitions .",
    "nevertheless , our results suggest that the dynamical slowing - down of lysozyme induced by the presence of sugars may stabilize globular proteins against thermal denaturation .",
    "in addition , our results indicate that lysozyme remains preferentially hydrated in the studied concentration range , since the substitution of water - lysozyme hbs by sugar - lysozyme hbs is rather limited .",
    "the comparison of the expected biopreservative behaviors of the three studied disaccharides on lysozyme is not straightforward since maltose is a reducing sugar and may thus alter the structure of lysozyme when chemically reacting with its lysine and arginine residues via the maillard reaction .",
    "consequently , the comparison of sucrose and trehalose , which are naturally synthesized osmolytes , is more relevant in the context of preserving globular proteins .",
    "the results of this study indicate that trehalose has a stronger influence on the dynamics of water and lysozyme than sucrose and may therefore preserve more efficiently the native structure of lysozyme at higher temperatures , particularly at concentrations above @xmath9 40 - 50 wt % .",
    "these differences appear to primarily stem from their different topologies ( see figure  [ sugars ] ) , which cause the formation of intramolecular hbs in sucrose and - almost - none in trehalose .",
    "the main consequences are ( i ) a lower number of water molecules with which sucrose molecules may interact and ( ii ) the formation of sucrose clusters of lower sizes , which would have thus a reduced influence on the solvent and lysozyme dynamics .",
    "even though these differences between trehalose and sucrose appear relatively small at room temperature where lysozyme is in its compact native state , they may increase during the unfolding process of lysozyme and then play a major role . +",
