    "observations and theory suggest that complex multipolar magnetic fields prevail near the surface of neutron stars , and play an important role in the physics of rotation powered pulsars .",
    "the complexity of surface magnetic fields is determined by the evolution of magnetic fields in neutron stars . according to one scenario ( e.g. , blandford , applegate & hernquist 1983 ) ,",
    "the magnetic field is generated by currents flowing in the thin outer crust of the star , with thickness @xmath1 , where @xmath2  cm is the neutron star radius . in this case",
    ", the superposition of magnetic multipoles of order @xmath3 dominates the exterior field ( arons 1993 ) . assuming that the evolution of magnetic fields in isolated neutron stars is due to ohmic decay , mitra , konar & bhattacharya ( 1999 )",
    "show that the evolution of such high - order multipolar components ( @xmath4 ) is very similar to that of the dipolar field : the structure of the pulsar surface field does not vary much as the pulsar ages .",
    "an alternative approach by ruderman ( 1991a , b , c ) attributes the surface magnetic field evolution to changes in the magnetic field present in the core . due to stresses , caused by the spinning down or the spinning up of the neutron star , strong enough to drive the crustal lattice beyond its yield strength , moving magnetized crustal platelets",
    "are created and account for sunspot - like clumps of magnetic field at the stellar surface .",
    "one first reason for introducing non - dipolar magnetic fields close to the stellar surface lies in the inability for the pure surface dipolar field to provide sufficient pair production , as required for the generation of pulsar emission . in effect , in their classical paper , ruderman & sutherland ( 1975 ) state that the value of the radius of curvature of magnetic field lines , @xmath5 , should be about @xmath6  cm near the stellar surface , in order to fulfill the conditions for a copious pair production process in the polar vacuum gap .",
    "however , such small curvature radii can not be achieved assuming a pure dipolar magnetic field near the stellar surface : the contribution of non - dipolar magnetic components , present in the close vicinity of the neutron star in the form of either multipoles of order higher than the dipole one , or the sunspot - like clumps , is necessary .",
    "these components are supposed to be strong enough to change the local topology of the magnetic field in the vicinity of pulsar polar caps .",
    "arons & scharlemann ( 1979 ) also point out that pair creation in pulsars with very long periods is impossible without invoking magnetic fields more complex than the dipolar one . in a thorough study of the space - charge limited flow of electrons in combined surface dipolar and quadrupolar magnetic fields , barnard & arons ( 1982 )",
    "conclude that the curvature radii of resulting magnetic field lines can be much smaller than those of the pure dipolar field , and discuss the possible impact of this effect on both the pair creation process and the observations .",
    "chen & ruderman ( 1993 ) specify the conditions for a sufficient pair production to be triggered off , as required for the generation of pulsar emission .",
    "they conclude that only a very twisted ( @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the curvature radius at the stellar surface ) and strong ( @xmath9  g ) magnetic field ensures that on the @xmath10 diagram , the death line leaves all pulsars above itself , that is to say , permits their existence .",
    "however , an exception is the recently discovered psr j@xmath11 with period @xmath12  s ( young , manchester & johnston 1999 ) , which appears to lie even below this death line . with this latter observation in mind",
    ", gil & mitra ( 2001 ) study anew the pair creation process in a super - strong magnetic field .",
    "they conclude that all observed pulsars , including psr j@xmath11 , lie above the death lines deduced from their model , which adopts @xmath13 ( although still @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 . here , @xmath16",
    "g is the critical magnetic field strength above which the photon splitting phenomenon may inhibit the pair formation process ( daugherty & harding 1983 ) , while @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively the dipolar and the total - dipolar plus multipolar - magnetic field strengths at the stellar surface .",
    "thus , according to gil & mitra ( 2001 ) , such extremely strong and curved magnetic fields are able to resolve in a natural way the long - standing controversy about the so - called binding energy problem , from which vacuum gap models suffered so far , without the necessity to involve bare polar cap strange stars , as proposed by xu , qiao & zhang ( 1999 ) .",
    "unfortunately , only the dipolar component of the surface magnetic field , more exactly , only its component perpendicular to the line of sight , is inferred from the observed spin - down rate of a pulsar , thus leaving the possibility for different hypotheses .",
    "for instance , krolik ( 1991 ) assumes that the rotational energy loss of a pulsar @xmath19 results from the electromagnetic radiation generated by the ensemble of individual magnetic multipoles which are dominant at the pulsar light cylinder : this allows the surface value of each multipolar component to be constrained , so yielding limits on magnetic moments of high order ; the tightest limits are obtained for millisecond pulsars , due to their short periods @xmath20 and the small values of their derivatives @xmath21 .",
    "such restrictions on high - order field strengths at the light cylinder do not necessarily mean their absence close to the stellar surface , where they can even play a dominant role .",
    "krolik ( 1991 ) suggests that , if such is the case , the relative complexity of the profiles of millisecond pulsars results from the complexity of their actual magnetic field .",
    "recent interpretations of the observations of soft x - rays , probably emitted due to the heating of pulsar polar caps , lead to similar conclusions .",
    "page & sarmiento ( 1995 , 1996 ) for instance , show that it is impossible to obtain the high level of observed pulsed fractions , or to describe asymmetric x - ray profiles , under the assumption of a purely dipolar field : a much better fit to the observations is obtained by including a suitably oriented quadrupolar field component .",
    "on the other hand , cheng & zhang ( 1999 ) in their model suggest that a strong and complex surface magnetic field significantly affects the two hard thermal components , usually present in the x - ray emission of pulsars .",
    "interest in a multipole field dominant close to the star goes back to gil ( 1985 ) , who introduced a dominant quadrupolar magnetic field in order to explain peculiarities in the radio emission of the millisecond psr @xmath22 .",
    "recently observed features of radio emission of the pulsar psr b@xmath0 , reported by deshpande & rankin ( 1999 , 2001 ) , clearly indicate the existence of a system of 20 rotating sub - beams , in circulation around the magnetic axis of the star . this well organized and stable pattern of emission has been observed at three different frequencies , namely at 430  mhz , 111.5  mhz ( at arecibo ) and 34  mhz ( in india ) , which are supposed to represent three different altitudes above the stellar surface , according to the radhakrishnan & cooke ( 1969 ) model .",
    "this system of emission sub - beams can be associated with a set of plasma columns , with their feet in the acceleration region .",
    "the relativistic pair plasma flow in these columns is guided by the strong dipolar magnetic field up to ( and beyond ) the altitudes corresponding to the radio emission generation region . at these altitudes ,",
    "instabilities occurring in a particular plasma column give rise to a radio emission beam , independently of similar processes in adjacent columns .",
    "these beams form the emission cone .",
    "deshpande & rankin ( 2001 ) point out that the columns themselves are not drifting or rotating : it is the action in the acceleration region , located near the stellar surface , which is doing so while it feeds and maintains the plasma column just above it .",
    "several processes in the individual sub - beams are found to be stable : circulation time , intensities , polarisation characteristics and dimensions .",
    "however , as noticed by deshpande & rankin ( 2001 ) , there is no clear choice between a continuous drift effect and particle cascade sputters .",
    "they speculate that the memory of the sub - beam configuration may reside in either standing waves , or in heating of the surface ( varying along the magnetic azimuth ) , or in the seeding of the plasma columns , for instance , by sparks , created on a non - integer multiple of the circumference and thus apparently drifting .",
    "one way of describing successfully the observed set of discrete emission columns in the pulsar magnetosphere is to assume that close to the stellar surface the total magnetic field results from the superposition of a dipolar and a high - order multipolar components , both fields being axially symmetric and star - centered .",
    "moreover , to fulfill the requirements for an efficient pair creation just above the surface of the star , namely the possibility to have at the stellar surface a very twisted total magnetic field , one may consider that the strength of the assumed multipolar magnetic field is higher than the dipolar field strength , or at least comparable to it , and test that the radius of curvature of resulting magnetic field lines is less than the stellar radius .",
    "this concerns the domain of open field lines , as the latter includes the region where the emission process is supposed to arise ( at large distances from the stellar centre , @xmath23 ) .",
    "in this same domain , near the stellar surface , high magnetic multipolar components are supposed to be more efficient than the dipolar field in determining the properties of the vacuum gap and initiating the pair production process .",
    "let us remark that by ",
    "vacuum gap  is meant the domain located just above the surface of the star in which a non - zero component of the electric field in the direction parallel to the background magnetic field is able to accelerate charges .",
    "the likelihood of having a multipolar magnetic field with strength higher than , or comparable to the dipole field strength is reasonable if one takes into account the influence of the general - relativistic effect of inertial frame dragging on the electromagnetic field structure near a rotating neutron star , as suggested by muslimov & tsygan ( 1986 ) . in section  [ topology :",
    "intensification ] of this paper we estimate such amplification factors , using the formalism developed by muslimov & tsygan ( 1986 ) , and confirm that these factors increase with the multipolar order @xmath24 of the multipolar components involved .",
    "therefore , the actual strength of the high - order multipolar field components near the stellar surface may appear to be much higher than those estimated in the flat space - time .",
    "on the other hand , as mentioned above , the evolution of multipolar magnetic fields with @xmath4 due to ohmic diffusion follows the same pattern as that of the dipolar field ( mitra , konar & bhattacharya 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , there are reasonable grounds to believe that the dipolar and multipolar magnetic field components coexist and persist with their relative strengths .",
    "the above configuration can be used to explore pulsar radio emission theories . for instance , the pulsar emission cone , when associated with a stable configuration of an ensemble of emission columns , could possibly be traced back to spark discharges in the pulsar polar gap region .",
    "this could be done in reference to recent works involving sparks and non - stationary plasma in vacuum gap models ( usov 1987 ; ursov & usov 1988 ; asseo & melikidze 1998 ; melikidze , gil & pataraya 2000 ; gil & mitra 2001 ) . in a different way ,",
    "we model the whole system of observed twenty sub - beams as an ensemble of relativistic finite beams , flowing along the curved magnetic field lines of the open magnetosphere and immersed in external media . the two surrounding external media which limit these flowing sub - beams are , on one side , the medium that lies on closed field lines , and on the other side , the tenuous plasma present inside the hollow cone .",
    "the latter surrounds the pulsar magnetic axis , and is modified due to the presence of high - order multipolar magnetic field components near the stellar surface .",
    "we show how , in the case of millisecond or fast pulsars , the geometrical characteristics of the flowing beams in the radial and azimuthal directions allow us to treat each beam of the ensemble as isolated and immersed in external media .",
    "the complex dispersion relation for perturbations of the system is simplified , as the beams are extremely thin and as the propagating waves are excited close to resonance in the radio domain .",
    "such waves have simultaneously an electrostatic and electromagnetic character and thus are able to reach an observer . depending on the distance of the considered region to the surface of the star , either the finite beam , or the radiative , or the two - stream instability is the dominant one ( asseo 1995 ) . moreover ,",
    "whatever the altitude and the concerned instability , unstable waves with characteristics in agreement with observed waves can be considered as candidates for pulsar radio emission . in particular , close to the surface of the star , above the gap region in which the observed beams are supposed to have their origin , the finite beam instability , dominant there , may initiate the radio emission process in the plasma columns .",
    "farther away the classical emission processes are available .    in the case of slower pulsars , like psr @xmath0",
    ", the geometrical characteristics of the flowing beams in the radial and azimuthal directions prevent considering each particular beam of the ensemble as isolated , just above the gap region and up to some distance @xmath25 .",
    "there , all the beams forming the emitting region have to be treated simultaneously .",
    "this can be done by introducing the 3-dimensional dependence of the perturbed physical quantities , leading to a simple analytical treatment of the whole system of sub - beams . in between the gap region and the region located at and above @xmath25 , simultaneous dependence of the perturbations on the radial and azimuthal variables",
    "will complicate the character of the emitted waves . in effect , the 3-dimensional character of perturbed physical quantities results in the coupling of the features of excited waves in the radial and azimuthal directions . beyond the distance @xmath25 , the sub - beams of the ensemble can be considered as isolated , so that the resulting perturbations should resemble those described above for fast pulsars : the character of the unstable emitted waves should be recovered .",
    "however , the existence of the necessary transition between the two regions , below and above @xmath25 , and thus the required continuity of the wave - solutions through this transition zone , suggest the possibility for an apparent drift of the observed waves .    in the present paper",
    "we examine several magnetic configurations involving dipolar and strong multipolar magnetic field components , in order to determine those which provide small curvature radii , as required by standard magnetospheric models .",
    "note that our calculations only concern the simplified case of the so - called aligned rotator , i.e. a pulsar whose dipolar magnetic momentum @xmath26 is parallel , or anti - parallel , to the rotation axis @xmath27 , and similarly for the magnetic momenta of the different multipoles .",
    "however , we believe that most of our qualitative results also apply to inclined rotators .    as a starting point we suppose that magnetic multipoles of order @xmath28 , created by the currents flowing in the stellar crust ( blandford et  al .",
    "1983 ; arons 1993 ) , are superimposed on the total dipolar field . a multipole component with @xmath29",
    "we refer to as axially symmetric and uniform , and the one with a non - zero @xmath30  as axially symmetric and non - uniform. let us note that uniformity , and not the symmetry , is the main difference between these two structures of the magnetic field near the polar cap",
    ". indeed , while @xmath31 -type fields are simultaneously symmetric and uniform , @xmath32 -type fields are symmetric around the magnetic axis but non - uniform , being fragmented as shown below . in section  [ fields ] , we present the general formalism to describe the multipolar fields .",
    "we also consider the configurations composed of the global dipolar field and a single axially symmetric and uniform multipolar field , and find out that neutral points and neutral lines , i.e. places of zero magnetic field strength , may exist near the neutron star surface in such a geometry . in section  [ topology ] , we model the magnetic structure of complex configurations in the vicinity of the stellar surface , and calculate the curvature radii of resulting field lines near the stellar surface .",
    "we conclude that the curvature radii of field lines in configurations containing only axially symmetric and uniform multipolar fields are not small enough to ignite the pair creation process above the pulsar polar cap , even if contributing multipoles are of very high order . on the other hand",
    ", we find that configurations involving axially symmetric and non - uniform multipolar magnetic fields allow to achieve the small curvature radii of field lines , within a fraction of the modified polar cap .",
    "furthermore , the pair plasma flow at large altitudes from the stellar surface appears to be fragmented into a system of isolated filaments , distributed symmetrically around the pulsar magnetic axis , around the margin of the open dipolar flux tube .",
    "we apply this model to psr  b@xmath0 and find resemblance with the observed pattern of its radio emission ( deshpande & rankin 1999 , 2001 ) . in section  [ model",
    "] , we discuss radio emission processes in the system of discrete sub - beams of dense plasma , surrounded by media of reduced density , in relation with an analysis previously proposed by asseo ( 1995 ) .",
    "this is done for either millisecond and fast pulsars or for slower pulsars like psr b@xmath0 .",
    "a summary of our results is presented in section  [ summary ] .",
    "throughout this paper we use a system of spherical coordinates ( @xmath33 ) where @xmath34 is the distance measured from the stellar centre , @xmath35 is the polar angle ( in radians ) measured from the @xmath36-axis , and @xmath37 is the azimuthal angle ( in radians ) measured from an arbitrary origin . the @xmath36-axis",
    "is directed along the dipolar momentum of the star @xmath26 .      in the near zone limit",
    "( @xmath38 ) , the magnetic field vector , @xmath39 , associated with a given magnetic multipole @xmath40 , can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics @xmath41 ( jackson 1975 ) : @xmath42 spherical harmonics are written in terms of the associated legendre functions , as @xmath43 where @xmath44 , the associated legendre function , is defined as @xmath45    in a spherical geometry , the components of an individual multipolar magnetic field vector @xmath46 are written :    @xmath47    @xmath48    @xmath49    particular multipolar magnetic components are obtained for specific values of @xmath24 and @xmath30 , with @xmath50 .",
    "namely , dipolar components are obtained for @xmath51 and either @xmath31 or @xmath52 , quadrupolar components for @xmath53 and either @xmath31 , @xmath54 or @xmath55 and so on . if @xmath31 and @xmath24 is arbitrary , then one obtains axially symmetric and uniform multipolar components .",
    "the magnetic moment , associated with the strength of the magnetic multipole component @xmath40 at the surface of the star , is defined as @xmath56 .",
    "the total magnetic field of the neutron star can be written as a sum of the individual multipolar magnetic field components . in the hypothesis",
    "where all the multipoles are centered at the centre of the star , @xmath57    magnetic field lines for the total magnetic field are obtained , as usual , from an integration of the set of differential equations : @xmath58    a unit vector in the direction of the local magnetic field @xmath59 can be defined as : @xmath60    the absolute value of the derivative of @xmath61 along the field line is nothing else than the curvature of the magnetic field line . at a given point of space @xmath62 , the radius of curvature of the total magnetic field line is therefore defined as @xmath63    naturally , if one assumes the existence of only one pure individual multipolar magnetic field component around the star , the equations of its field lines and their curvature radii can be easily obtained from equations  ( [ equations ] ) and ( [ rho ] ) by substituting @xmath64 instead of the total field @xmath65 .      in this section",
    "we treat multipolar magnetic fields of type @xmath66 , i.e. those for which @xmath24 is arbitrary but @xmath31 .",
    "such fields can be regarded to as dipolar - like , as they are axially symmetric and uniform in the vicinity of pulsar polar caps , like the dipolar magnetic field .    according to equations",
    "( [ b_r ] @xmath67 [ b_total ] ) , for the case with @xmath31 , the components of the total magnetic field close to the surface of the star can be expressed in a general form as a sum of multipolar magnetic field components , namely @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the magnetic moment associated with @xmath72 , the strength of the multipolar magnetic field component at the surface of the star , @xmath73 being a positive quantity according to its definition ; @xmath74 is a constant which depends on the order @xmath24 of the multipole ; @xmath75 and @xmath76 are specific functions which only depend on powers of @xmath77 ; @xmath78 and @xmath79 are numerical coefficients .",
    "as implied by maxwell s equations , the static magnetic field vector can be defined through the magnetic vector potential @xmath80 , as @xmath81 .",
    "thus , one can associate a vector potential @xmath82 with any arbitrary magnetic multipole with indices @xmath24 and @xmath30 .",
    "obviously , in the axially symmetric and uniform case with arbitrary @xmath24 and with @xmath29 , each multipolar component of the magnetic field vector , @xmath83 , derives from a potential vector @xmath84 . assuming that the magnetic field is created by an extremely thin current that circulates all over the crust of the neutron star , the potential vector has only an azimuthal component @xmath85 , which can be specified for each particular magnetic multipole having indices @xmath86 and @xmath29 , in terms of the corresponding current , or equivalently in terms of the magnetic moment @xmath73 and the variables @xmath35 and @xmath34 , as @xmath87 where the functions @xmath76 have been introduced just above .",
    "magnetic field lines are obtained as usual from an integration of the set of two differential equations ( [ equations ] ) . here , for the axially symmetric and uniform case with arbitrary @xmath24 and @xmath88 , the @xmath37-component of the magnetic field being zero , it is sufficient to consider the multipole magnetic field components in a plane @xmath89 , and to integrate only the first differential equation , namely @xmath90    a systematic derivation of the equations of field lines of any particular magnetic multipole can also be obtained , introducing the function @xmath91 which is an integral of the field equations . effectively ,",

    "these functions , according to equation ( [ psi = const ] ) , provide magnetic field line equations for the appropriate particular multipolar fields .",

    "a study of the behaviour of the magnetic field around this point will probably show that it may be considered as a neutral point for particular configurations of the magnetic field in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "for instance , this should be the case when the total magnetic field can be represented by a combination of either dipolar and quadrupolar magnetic fields , or dipolar and octupolar magnetic field , or dipolar and 16-polar magnetic field and so on , the equations for the field lines being , respectively , @xmath136",

    "the solution @xmath140 depends on the ratio of the multipolar and the dipolar magnetic field strengths .",
    "more generally , for an arbitrary @xmath35-angle there is a neutral line on which the magnetic field is zero .",
    "for instance , if the magnetic field is taken as the simple combination of dipolar and quadrupolar magnetic fields , the function @xmath141 becomes zero at either @xmath142 or @xmath143 , or on the line where @xmath144 that is to say , on the circle defined by the equation @xmath145    in this case , there are three neutral lines : the two axes , @xmath146 and @xmath123 and a circle in the plane @xmath147 , on which the only acceptable @xmath34-solutions correspond to @xmath35-angles in the domain @xmath148 $ ] . indeed , depending on the respective values of @xmath149 and @xmath150 , the @xmath34-solutions on the neutral circle have a physical meaning , or none .",

    "a study of the behaviour of the magnetic field on lines close to the neutral line is necessary to conclude about the specific physical processes in this region .",
    "in this section we study the topology of magnetic field configurations near the stellar surface , which consist of a multipolar magnetic field @xmath159 ( with @xmath160 and @xmath50 ) , superimposed on the global dipolar field of the pulsar @xmath161 .",
    "we also introduce the ratio of the total and the dipolar magnetic field strengths , @xmath162 where @xmath163 .",
    "therefore , @xmath164 indicates how many times the strength of the total field exceeds the strength of its dipolar component , at a given point of space @xmath62 . in the calculations reported in sections  [ topology : m=0 ] and [ topology : m/=0 ] ,",
    "particular attention is paid to the cases where the curvature radius of magnetic field lines at the stellar surface is smaller than the stellar radius , i.e. @xmath165 , at least within a fraction of the modified polar cap .",
    "intuitively , one would expect that such configurations assume a significant contribution of the multipolar component , so that @xmath166 .    in order to test various magnetic configurations , we redefine the expression for the multipolar field components ( equation  [ b_lm ] ) by introducing an extra amplification factor @xmath167 as a free parameter , so that this expression now takes the following form : @xmath168 a specific choice of the @xmath167-factor in every particular example considered below , is justified by the output : it should allow us to obtain the expected structure and strength of the surface magnetic field above the modified polar cap .",
    "amplification of certain multipolar components is discussed in detail in section  [ topology : intensification ] .    in order to model the geometry of the total magnetic field , one has to solve the set of differential equations  ( [ equations ] ) , which is now convenient to rewrite in the following form : @xmath169 this set of equations has to be solved for the unknown functions @xmath170 and @xmath171 .    of course",
    ", the complex surface magnetic field should transform into the global pure dipolar field at large altitudes from the stellar surface , where multipolar components effectively vanish .",

    "moreover , this flow will also be fragmented azimuthally : pair plasma will flow only along the bundles of field lines which were stretched towards the local multipolar poles while emerging from the stellar surface . in the case of @xmath264 , presented above , this corresponds to four isolated bundles of field lines .",

    "as demonstrated in section  [ topology : m/=0 ] , the particular magnetic field topology which results from the superposition of the global dipolar magnetic field and a high - order multipolar field with @xmath190 , both with high strength , suggests that the pair plasma created at the bases of magnetic flux tubes is guided within isolated thin filaments , located at the outer margin of the bundle of open magnetic field lines .",

    "outside , the plasma is supposed to have a much smaller density , of the order of the goldreich & julian density , @xmath278 .",

    "the simplest case concerns one flowing annular beam of relativistic pair plasma surrounded by external plasmas .",
    "the dispersion relation giving the characteristics of perturbations able to propagate in such a system were obtained matching the solutions for the electromagnetic field components at the different beam - plasma interfaces ( asseo 1995 ) .",
    "the case of the ensemble of twenty isolated sub - beams discussed in section  [ psr ] is more complex : the beams are supposed to be regularly distributed over a ring that delimits the emission region ; they have different radial and azimuthal extents and are separated over the ring by distances of the order of their azimuthal extent .",
    "the radial variation of the density operates in two different ways : either there is an abrupt change of the density at the edges of the ring , or there is none .",
    "the azimuthal changes of the density from one beam to the next one are alike .",
    "the geometrical characteristics of the relativistic beams are evaluated taking into account the fact that the observed ensemble of twenty beams have their origin in the gap region , very close to the stellar surface , where the complex multipolar field determines the pair creation process . as concluded in the previous section ( see figs .",
    "[ all_theta_20](c ) and [ all_phi_20_frac](c ) for details ) , the radial angular width of an individual sub - beam constitutes a fraction equal to about 1/20 of the total radius of the open field lines tube at an altitude @xmath172 ( where @xmath279 ) , whereas its azimuthal angular width represents a fraction equal to about 1/40 of the circumference .",
    "therefore , at some distance @xmath172 ( see section  [ topology : general ] ) , the radial and azimuthal extents of individual sub - beams can be estimated as , respectively , @xmath280 } \\label{w_r}\\ ] ] and @xmath281 } , \\label{w_phi}\\ ] ] where equation  ( [ theta_max ] ) has been used in order to evaluate @xmath282 .",
    "for example , at a distance @xmath283 , far above the gap region , the numerical estimates for the individual sub - beam width yield @xmath284  cm and @xmath285  cm , respectively , for a pulsar with period @xmath286  s. the ratio of the azimuthal and radial sub - beam widths is constant , namely @xmath287 whatever the distance , but the typical wavelengths associated with observed radio frequencies are smaller than these characteristic widths .",
    "thus , one should test whether it is sufficient to consider two - dimensional perturbations of the whole system of beams immersed in exterior media , or if it is necessary to analyse the fate of 3-dimensional perturbations .",
    "this can be checked as in asseo , pellat & sol ( 1983 ) , considering the strongest instabilities which may develop in a thin beam surrounded by different plasmas .    in the previous sections we used the spherical system of",
    "coordinates @xmath288 , centered at the stellar centre . instead",
    ", in this section it is convenient to use a cylindrical system of coordinates @xmath289 , adequate for a local description . here",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath290 is measured along the local curvature radius of the magnetic field line ; @xmath291 is the azimuthal angle which corresponds to the angular variation along the circle with the radius @xmath5 , this circle being tangent to the magnetic field line passing through the point @xmath147 in the plane @xmath292 of the spherical geometry ; @xmath36 is the coordinate perpendicular to the plane @xmath293 .    assuming 3-dimensional perturbations in the cylindrical system depending on ( @xmath294 ) and characterized by wave - numbers @xmath30 and @xmath295 , the strongest instabilities are obtained at the resonant frequency @xmath296 and for transverse wave - numbers in the domain @xmath297 . in this case the analytical solutions obtained for the electromagnetic fields characterizing the perturbation in terms of bessel and hankel functions , result in an unmodified growth rate of the instabilities",
    "consequently , they are valid for beams with a spatial extent @xmath298 where we used the fact that the spatial extent of a sub - beam @xmath299 is nothing else but its azimuthal width @xmath300 ( equation  [ w_phi ] ) .",
    "numerical estimates show that in the case of millisecond and fast pulsars the constraint  ( [ fin ] ) is easily fulfilled just above the gap region and beyond , considering the domain of observed radio frequencies @xmath301 ( see figs .",
    "[ finite](a ) and ( b ) , respectively ) .",
    "this indicates that in such a case , finite transverse dimensions do not modify the results obtained in cylindrical geometry using two - dimensional perturbations to characterize radio emission features generated above the gap region within an annular hollow conical beam , or within an ensemble of discrete sub - beams similar to those observed in psr b@xmath0 .    in such conditions",
    ", one may consider that locally the propagating wave only sees the radial variations of the density , so that it is possible to treat the problem in a poloidal plane .",
    "while doing so , we ignore the density variations in the direction corresponding to the azimuthal @xmath37-direction of the spherical geometry , that is to say , in the transverse @xmath36-direction of the cylindrical geometry , and treat each beam of the ensemble of beams as isolated and immersed in infinite exterior media .",
    "this allows us to extend the results which concern the characteristics of the perturbations able to propagate in the system formed by relativistic beam and plasma flows which fill a hollow conical region and are immersed in exterior media , to the more complex situation of the ensemble of beams .    the dispersion relation specific to the case of a finite beam immersed in external media",
    "was obtained by matching the solutions for the electromagnetic field components at the different beam - plasma interfaces ( asseo 1995 ) .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of the dielectric constant for the relativistic beam plus relativistic plasma flows , @xmath302 , and of the dielectric constants of the exterior media , @xmath303 and @xmath304 .",
    "it is obtained close to the resonant frequency , @xmath305 where @xmath306 is the frequency associated with the circulation of relativistic particles along magnetic flux tubes and @xmath307 is the relative growth rate .",

    "such a dispersion relation for finite beam and plasma flows differs from the dispersion relation that characterizes the two - stream instability obtained for infinite and homogeneous beam and plasmas described in a straight geometry , namely @xmath312 .",
    "it is modified due to the presence of external media with dielectric constants @xmath303 and @xmath313",
    ". it is also modified due to geometric properties of the flow : more precisely the curvature of the magnetic field , as the radius of curvature @xmath5 of magnetic field lines is involved , the finite width of the beam @xmath311 and the azimuthal wave - number of the perturbation @xmath30 .",
    "the analysis of this modified dispersion relation in different limits shows that it allows the description of both the radiative ( see goldreich & keeley ( 1971 ) who first described it ) and two - stream instabilities , well - known in the context of pulsar physics , but also that there is an unexpected instability : the finite beam instability , which even develops for a one - component beam of relativistic mono - energetic particles bounded by external media .",
    "the characteristics of the finite beam instability were obtained in the most general conditions for a beam bounded by identical , or non - identical , external media from the above dispersion relation ( asseo 1995 ) .",
    "the case of a beam bounded by identical external media with @xmath314 , is of interest here for an ensemble of beams delineated by the superposition of a strong multipole magnetic field plus a dipole field . in the thin beam case with @xmath315 ,",
    "the dispersion relation simplifies to : @xmath316 the dependence on the presence of external plasmas appears through @xmath303 .",
    "the dependence on the geometric properties of the flow appears through the parameter : @xmath317 for the magnetic configuration which includes both dipolar and multipolar magnetic field components , the value of the radius of curvature of magnetic field lines varies with the distance from the stellar surface . within the gap region from which the beams are issued ,",
    "the radius of curvature of magnetic field lines is of the order , or even less , than the radius of the star , @xmath318 . beyond , in the region where the dipolar magnetic field is dominant ,",
    "the radius of curvature is approximately @xmath319 , ( indeed , @xmath320  cm at the distance @xmath321 ) .",
    "therefore , the azimuthal wavenumber which corresponds to the resonant frequency at which the instabilities are triggered off , fixed by the relation @xmath322 , slightly varies in the radio emission domain which starts above the gap region ( see asseo 1995 ) . at such resonant frequencies ,",
    "@xmath323 only depends on the radial extent of the involved annular beam or sub - beams .",
    "numerical estimates with usual parameters for a pulsar with @xmath252  s show that in the domain of observed radio frequencies @xmath324  hz and for the radius of curvature of magnetic field lines in the domain @xmath325  cm , @xmath326 is smaller than unity . above the gap region , but relatively close to it , the ratio of the ring width to the radius of curvature of magnetic field lines is very small , @xmath327 , for values of the radius of curvature in the domain @xmath328  cm .",
    "thus , we are in the thin beam case , the dispersion relation  ( [ dispersion ] ) is valid in its limiting form ( equation  [ dispersion_thin ] ) , and the approximation @xmath329 is adequate , the parameter @xmath326 being much smaller than unity . in this case , the dispersion relation  ( [ dispersion ] ) simplifies to @xmath330 .",
    "such a dispersion relation is adequate to describe a limited region of emission whatever its altitude . for a one - component beam of relativistic particles with lorentz factors",

    "therefore , the distance @xmath357 , at which @xmath358 , is not significantly different from the distance @xmath357 obtained in the case where there are no multipolar field components in addition to the dipolar field , as the relative contribution of the multipolar magnetic field , @xmath359 , is very small . in effect , @xmath357 is simply determined from the relation @xmath360 where @xmath361 and @xmath362 \\left(\\frac{r_{\\mathrm s}}{r } \\right)^3}. \\label{flim}\\ ] ] @xmath357 increases with the strength of the total magnetic field but decreases as the pulsar period and the frequency associated with the circulation of relativistic beam particles increase . in the extreme case of a millisecond pulsar with parameters",

    "the distance @xmath357 is important in delineating the different regions of instability : below @xmath357 the finite beam instability is dominant whereas beyond @xmath377 either the radiative or the two - stream instabilities prevail . as a matter of fact , the behaviour and growth rate of the finite beam instability is different according to the distance of the considered emission region to the stellar surface .",
    "the characteristics of the unstable waves excited trough the finite beam instability  frequency , polarisation , available electromagnetic energy and growth rate  are in agreement with pulsar radio observations ( asseo 1995 ) .",
    "thus , the finite beam instability will initiate the radio emission process in the ensemble of beams with their origin in the gap region , relatively close to the surface of the star .",
    "moreover , such an instability strongly depends on the ratio of densities at the basis of the magnetic tube within and outside the limited beam .",
    "as the density of the created pair plasma may vary , an observed apparent motion of the beams around the magnetic axis could be related to variations of the densities within and outside the successive tubes .",
    "numerical estimates concerning the above constraint on the spatial extension of the beams , required to ignore azimuthal variations of the perturbations ( equation  [ fin ] ) , show that in the case of psr b@xmath0 this constraint is not uniformly satisfied in the whole region above the gap ( see fig .",
    "[ finite](c ) ) . the distance @xmath25 from the center of the star beyond which the constraint is satisfied varies with the frequency of observation : as clear from fig .",
    "[ finite](c ) , larger distances correspond to lower frequencies .",
    "indeed , @xmath378  cm for a frequency of observation @xmath379  mhz , @xmath380  cm for @xmath381  mhz and @xmath382  cm for @xmath383  mhz .    consequently , between the gap region and the location @xmath384 , it is necessary to take into account the 3-dimensional character of the perturbations able to propagate in the system of discrete sub - beams : the density variations in the direction corresponding to the azimuthal @xmath37-direction of the spherical geometry , that is to say , in the transverse @xmath36-direction of the cylindrical geometry , can not be further ignored and the ensemble of sub - beams has to be considered as a whole system immersed in infinite exterior media .",
    "thus , an additional systematic azimuthal variation of the perturbations below @xmath25 will exist and modify the character of perturbations beyond @xmath25 , in the domain where 2-dimensional perturbations are dominant .",
    "in fact a coupling of the different perturbed physical quantities is involved as soon as one introduces an azimuthal dependence of the perturbations at relatively small distances from the surface of the star . a thorough treatment including the dependence on the coordinates @xmath385 of the specified cylindrical geometry of the perturbations is possible as in asseo et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , writing the perturbations as of the type : @xmath386 }    \\exp { [ -{\\mathrm i}(\\omega t - m \\phi)]}.\\ ] ] obviously , the character of the perturbations in the region located beyond @xmath25 has to approach the one described above for fast pulsars , whereas in the region below @xmath25 it is modified by the dependence on the variable @xmath387 and wave - number @xmath295 .",
    "although we here restrict to a qualitative explanation , and leave exact calculations concerning the character of 3-dimensional perturbations for future work , this suggests that for psr b@xmath0 , the observed rotation , and/or drifting , of the emitting columns may be a trace of the initial waves formed in the region below @xmath25 and of their transition towards the above region .",
    "most of the pulsars which exhibit beautiful drifting subpulses ",
    "psrs @xmath388 , @xmath389 , @xmath390 , @xmath391 , @xmath392 and @xmath0  show periodic drifts ( as observed and/or classified by rankin ( 1986 ) , see table  2 therein ) .",
    "we notice that all the quoted pulsars have sufficiently long periods to be modelled in analogy of psr b@xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that drifting effects , already known as intrinsically conal phenomena and associated with the circulation of disturbances within the annular polar cap region , could also result from similar perturbations moving within a hollow conical region fragmented into discrete sub - beams .",
    "then , azimuthal widths of the sub - beams will be reflected in the character of unstable excited perturbations .",
    "in this paper we study the complex magnetic topology in the vicinity of neutron stars .",
    "we restrict to the case of the aligned rotator , assuming parallel , or anti - parallel , orientation of the rotation and magnetic axes .",
    "we assume that the total magnetic field results from the superposition of the global dipolar field and of star - centered multipolar fields of comparable , or even of higher strength .",
    "we obtain the following results :    1 .   for configurations involving axially symmetric and uniform multipolar magnetic fields it is not possible to obtain small curvature radii of the magnetic field lines , even for multipoles of higher order and strength relative to the dipolar field .",
    "let us recall that according to pulsar polar gap models , curvature radii of the order of the stellar radius are crucial for an efficient pair creation process .",
    "an interesting consequence of such a magnetic topology is the existence of neutral points and neutral lines above one of the pulsar polar caps .",
    "we plan to study implications of such peculiar features of the magnetic field geometry in future works .",
    "3 .   for configurations involving axially symmetric and non - uniform multipolar magnetic fields , the magnetic field structure just above the polar cap",
    "is modified in such a way that the pair plasma flow at high altitudes appears as modulated in separate filaments regularly distributed around the outer margin of the open flux tube .",
    "such filaments have their feet in the modified polar cap .",
    "they are thin and have finite radial and azimuthal extents .",
    "therefore , the non - uniform pattern of the distribution of curvature radii over the polar cap is reflected in the inhomogeneous distribution of the pair plasma density within the cross - section of the open flux tube at high altitudes .",
    "4 .   for the particular superposition of a dipolar field and a multipolar field of order @xmath393 and @xmath268 ,",
    "the magnetic topology causes fragmentation of the pair plasma flow into twenty isolated thin filaments .",
    "this resembles the set of twenty sub - beams observed by deshpande & rankin ( 1999 , 2001 ) in psr b@xmath0 .",
    "emission in such a system of isolated thin beams , flowing along the curved magnetic field lines , can be described in terms of unstable waves excited by specific instabilities .",
    "relativistic finite beams flowing in the pulsar magnetosphere along a limited fraction of the hollow cone surrounding the magnetic axis can be treated as immersed in exterior media , namely the medium in the closed field line region and the medium within the hollow cone of the open magnetosphere ( asseo 1995 ) .",
    "three different instabilities may develop in such finite beams , depending on the distance to the center of the star : the finite beam , radiative and two - stream instabilities .",
    "as previously obtained by asseo ( 1995 ) , close to the surface of the star the finite beam instability will generate waves whose properties ( frequency , polarisation and available electromagnetic energy ) are in agreement with the observed pulsar radio emission .",
    "we check that the conditions for such a treatment are relevant for the configuration of discrete sub - beams that may exist in millisecond and fast pulsars .",
    "they are also relevant for slower pulsars , like psr b@xmath394 beyond some distance from the gap region . on the other hand , closer to the gap of such a slow pulsar , the radial and azimuthal variations of the flowing sub - beams",
    "can not be separated ; the system of sub - beams has to be treated as a whole ; the 3-dimensional character of the perturbations will introduce some drift of the emitted waves ; such a drift effect will be transferred to high altitudes due to the necessary continuity between the vicinity of the gap and the farther region . in this way , the continuity of the flow all along magnetic flux tubes and of the perturbations carried by it , accounts for the drifting character of the subpulses observed in pulsar radio profiles .",
