    "the spectrum of a high / soft state is dominated by blackbody - like component emitted from an optically thick , geometrically thin disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent x - ray observations of outbursts of gx 339 - 4 indicate that the source stays in the spectrally hard and luminous intermediate state during the transition from low / hard state to the high / soft state ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it has been suggested that relativistic ballistic ejections occur during the transition from this intermediate state to the optically thick , soft state @xcite .",
    "outbursts of black hole candidates are triggered by the increase of the mass accretion rate from the outer radius @xcite . in the early stage of an outburst , since a hot , optically thin , hard x - ray emitting disk is formed around the black hole , the black hole candidate is observed as staying in the low / hard state .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the disk increases as the accretion rate increases . @xcite",
    "obtained thermal equilibrium curves of optically thin accretion disks including both the bremsstrahlung cooling and advective cooling ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they showed that when the mass accretion rate ( and , hence , surface density ) exceeds some limit , optically thin disks can not be in thermal equilibrium because the radiative cooling overwhelms the heating .",
    "when this limit is reached , therefore , a thermal instability is triggered so that the disk should cool and shrink in the vertical direction ( @xcite ; lasota , narayan , & yi 1996 ) .    during this vertical contraction of the disk , magnetic fields in the turbulent disk",
    "will be amplified due to flux conservation or will be dissipated by magnetic reconnection . in the former case",

    "the possible existence of such low-@xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) disk was pointed out by shibata , tajima & matsumoto ( 1990 ) .",
    "although magnetic flux can buoyantly escape from the disk by the parker instability @xcite , once low-@xmath0 disk is formed , the disk stays in the low-@xmath0 state because magnetic tension prevents the growth of the parker instability .",
    "they called such disks as _ magnetic cataclysmic disks _ because explosive events will take place when the magnetic energy stored in the disk is released .",
    "mineshige , kusunose & matsumoto ( 1995 ) suggested that low-@xmath0 disks may correspond to the low / hard state .",

    "it has been shown that the mhd turbulence driven by magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) enhances the angular momentum transport rate and enables mass accretion .",

    "machida , nakamura & matsumoto ( 2004 ) showed that the radial structure of its innermost region ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the schwarzschild radius ) agrees well with that of one - dimensional steady transonic solutions , in which the radial advection and the radial dependence of @xmath2 are both taken into account .",

    "the average ratio of maxwell stress to the total pressure @xmath156 slightly decreases but stays around @xmath157 .",

    "this luminosity is normalized by the eddington luminosity .",
    "x - ray luminosity increases during the growth of the thermal instability because the equatorial density increases 10 times while the temperature decreases 100 times .",

    "the disk luminosity shown in figure [ fig : lum ] is an order of magnitude smaller than this limit because the innermost region ( @xmath111 ) still stays in radiatively inefficient optically thin , hot state",
    ". the saturation level of the luminosity will increase if we start simulation with larger @xmath85 because the maximum accretion rate from the outer torus increases as the initial density of the torus increases .",
    "when the accretion rate further increases , the conversion rate from rest mass energy to radiation will also increase because the inner region of the disk undergoes a transition to radiatively efficient cool disk . in this paper",
    ", we only included the bremsstrahlung cooling .",
    "it should be noted that in optically thin , hot , magnetized disks , synchrotron compton cooling may also contribute to increase the x - ray luminosity .",
    "in this paper , we have shown by direct numerical simulations without assuming @xmath2-viscosity that magnetically supported disk is created during the transition from a low / hard state to a high / soft state in black hole accretion flows .",
    "figure [ fig : f8 ] schematically shows the evolution of an optically thin accretion disk . as the accretion rate from the outer disk increases ( figure [ fig : f8]a ) , the density of the inner accretion disk increases .",
    "when the density of the disk exceeds the critical density for the onset of the cooling instability at some radius , the disk cools and thus shrinks in the vertical direction ( figure [ fig : f8]b ) . in such regions , magnetic pressure dominates the gas pressure because ( 1 ) gas pressure decreases due to cooling , while ( 2 ) the azimuthal magnetic field increases as the disk shrinks in the vertical direction .",
    "the latter is due to the formation of sector structures in azimuthal magnetic fields .",
    "if the magnetic fields in turbulent accretion disks are purely random , they will be dissipated by magnetic reconnection , when the disk shrinks in the vertical direction . if magnetic fields have coherent structures such that the azimuthal component has the same sign in some regions , however , they can survive during the contraction due to cooling .",
    "moreover , the field strength increases as the region shrinks conserving the toroidal magnetic flux .",
    "since magnetic pressure supports the disk even when temperature decreases , the disk stops shrinking in the vertical direction and approaches a new equilibrium state .",
    "the magnetically supported disk emits power - law hard x - rays because the disk still stays in optically thin state . since the critical surface density for the onset of the cooling instability in the inner radius is larger than that in the outer radius when bremsstrahlung cooling is assumed @xcite , the inward propagation of the cooling front stops and the innermost region stays in the hot state .",
    "we expect that when the accretion rate from the outer disk further increases , the transition radius between the hot , gas pressure dominated region and the cool , magnetic pressure dominated region will move inward ( figure [ fig : f8]c ) .",
    "the evolution of the innermost region of optically thin disks will depend on the cooling mechanism .",
    "when the synchrotron and/or compton cooling were included , transition to the magnetically supported disk may start from the inner region because the cooling rate in the innermost region of the disk will be enhanced .",
    "numerical results revealed that as the cooling instability grows , the disk approaches to a quasi - steady state when a low-@xmath0 disk is formed .",
    "the cooling time scale is @xmath174 , here @xmath175 represents the average of a quantity over a range of @xmath176 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3]b shows that the equatorial temperature stays @xmath177 at least for time scale of @xmath178 .",
    "this indicates that in this state , heating balances with cooling . since the dissipative heating rate of turbulent accretion disks is comparable to @xmath179 @xcite , the heating time scale can be estimated by @xmath180 $ ] , where @xmath181 . before the thermal instability grows , since the disk is dominated by gas pressure , and @xmath182 ( see figure [ fig : bxby]a ) , @xmath183 \\sim 2000 $ ] . after the cooling instability grows , the disk evolved toward a magnetic pressure dominated state in which @xmath184 .",

    "thus , when radiative cooling is included after a magnetically turbulent accretion disk is formed , subsequent evolution of the disk will not be sensitive to the initial configuration of magnetic fields .",
    "let us compare our numerical results with observations of black hole transients .",
    "@xcite pointed out that during the transition from the low / hard state to the high / soft state , gx 339 - 4 shows a sub - transition from hard intermediate state dominated by power - law x - ray radiation to soft intermediated state dominated by radiation from optically thick disk .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the hard intermediate state is 1 - 10% of the eddington luminosity in gx339 - 4 @xcite .",
    "this luminosity is much higher than the critical luminosity above which the optically thin , hot gas pressure dominated disk becomes thermally unstable . in our simulations ,",
    "the critical luminosity for this transition is about 0.2% of the eddington luminosity ( see figure [ fig : lum ] ) .",
    "the magnetic pressure dominated disk shows hard x - ray spectrum because it is still optically thin .",
    "thus , numerical results suggest that the luminous disk in the luminous hard state stays in the thermally stable low-@xmath0 branch .    the x - ray luminosity in our simulation results saturated at about 0.5% of the eddington luminosity because the mass accretion rate from the outer torus saturated at about @xmath170 ( figure [ fig : f9]b ) .",
    "we expect that when the mass accretion rate from the outer region continues to increase , the transition radius between the inner hot flow and the outer cool low-@xmath0 disk will move inward and the x - ray luminosity will continue to increase .",
    "such simulations will be possible by starting simulations from a torus initially located at larger radius .",
    "since the low-@xmath0 disk is supported by magnetic pressure , the transition to the optically thick ( soft intermediate ) state needs the dissipation or expulsion of magnetic fields supporting the disk .",
    "recently , @xcite pointed out that in galactic black hole candidates , relativistically moving blobs are ejected during the transition from a low / hard state to a high / soft state .",
    "our numerical results suggest that such ejections originate from the releases of magnetic energy stored in the low-@xmath0 disk .",
    "when magnetic flux inside the disk is ejected by such explosive events , the disk will again be supported by gas pressure and will be able to shrink further in the vertical direction .",
    "extraction of magnetic flux from the low-@xmath0 disk enables the disk to complete the transition to the optically thick , high / soft state .",
    "synchrotron and/or compton scattering are not included in the present study .",
    "if included , magnetically supported disks are expected to emit enhanced radiation from the inner parts of the disk .",
    "it may resolve the issue of overproduction of bremsstrahlung from the outer parts of the low luminosity mhd flow ( see @xcite for discussion ) .    in this paper",
    ", we assumed single temperature plasma . in optically thin , hot accretion disks ,",
    "electron temperature can be lower than the ion temperature .",
    "such two temperature global disk models including radial advection were studied by nakamura et al .",
    "( 1997 ; see also @xcite ) . to fit the observational spectra , two - temperature nature of accretion flow",
    "should be considered in the simulations .",
