    "bright hot spots of star formation ( sf ) in the circumnuclear regions of spiral galaxies are often closely connected to the existence of a bar . in many cases ,",
    "these hot spots make up a kpc  size ring or spiral pattern ( e.g. buta & crocker 1993 ) .",
    "multiwavelength studies have shown that these starburst rings have high sf and supernova rates ( e.g. hummel , van der hulst & keel 1987 , hereafter h87 ; genzel et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the circumnuclear sf rings are thought to arise as a consequence of a bar  driven gas inflow and dynamical resonances in the bar ( e.g. combes & gerin 1985 ; friedli & martinet 1993 ; piner , stone & teuben 1995 ) .",
    "dense gas accumulates in shocked regions of orbit crowding along the leading edges of the bar , loses angular momentum and flows inward .",
    "the gas accumulates in a ring between the two inner lindblad resonances ( ilr ) and experiences a starburst , either through collisions of molecular clouds or by gravitational collapse of the ring into dense fragments ( e.g. combes & gerin 1985 ; elmegreen 1994 ) .",
    "if no ilrs exist , the gas may continue to flow inward , resulting in a nuclear starburst without a ring ( telesco , dressel & wolstencroft 1993 ) .",
    "although there are plenty of examples of nuclear ring galaxies without nuclear activity , suggesting that the nuclear rings and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are not necessarily intimately related , there is , however , an indicative statistical correlation between the existence of nuclear rings and agn in barred galaxies ( knapen et al .",
    "one of the most important questions concerning the nuclear rings is , therefore , that of fuelling of the agn in their centers . since the large  scale flow slows down substantially at the ilr ring , additional mechanisms , such as bar instability within a central gas disk ( @xmath9bars within bars@xmath9 ; shlosman , frank & begelman 1989 ) , have been suggested to fuel the agn .",
    "multiwavelength studies of agn with circumnuclear rings can provide insights into how the massive star clusters in the rings and nuclear activity are related .",
    "the relatively unobscured near  infrared ( nir ) emission provides a better handle than optical emission to quantify the properties of sf in galaxies . in this paper",
    "we present high resolution broad ",
    "band @xmath0 images and the first nir br@xmath1 and h@xmath3 10 s(1 ) emission line images of two active galaxies with a circumnuclear sf ring , ngc 1097 and ngc 6574 .",
    "because of their brightness , large angular size and relatively face  on orientation , they provide excellent targets for studying these phenomena .",
    "br@xmath1 originates from h ii regions surrounding hot young ob star clusters , while h@xmath3 arises from hot molecular gas and traces the material available for sf .",
    "ngc 1097 is a nearby ( v@xmath10 = 1275 km s@xmath11 ; @xmath12 mpc ; 1@xmath13 = 90 pc ; h@xmath14 70 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 ) sbb galaxy with a strong bar ( @xmath15 ) , inclined at 46@xmath16 ( storchi  bergmann , wilson & baldwin 1996 ) .",
    "non  thermal emission due to shock compression of gas and dust associated with the smooth thin dust lanes at the leading edges of the bar is clearly visible in radio continuum ( ondrechen & van der hulst 1983 ) .",
    "ngc 1097 has an elliptical companion galaxy , ngc 1097a , which influences the western spiral arm by tidal interaction ( e.g. ondrechen , van der hulst & hummel 1989 ) .",
    "ngc 1097 contains a nuclear stellar bar ( @xmath17 ; quillen et al .",
    "1995 ) , almost perpendicular to the primary bar . based on optical emission line ratios , the nucleus of ngc 1097",
    "is usually classified as a liner ( phillips et al .",
    "1984 ) although the detection of broad , double peaked h@xmath4 emission ( storchi  bergmann et al . 1993 ) suggests a revised classification as a seyfert 1 .",
    "the most intriguing feature of ngc 1097 is the bright , almost circular circumnuclear sf ring ( diameter @xmath818@xmath13 = 1.6 kpc ) , which actually consists of two tightly wound clumpy spiral arms .",
    "it has been the target of extensive multiwavelength studies ( e.g. h87 ; gerin , nakai & combes 1987 : telesco et al .",
    "1993 ; barth et al . 1995 ; quillen et al . 1995 ; prez  olea & colina 1996 ; storchi  bergmann et al .",
    "according to storchi ",
    "bergmann et al . (",
    "1996 ) , the ring of ngc 1097 is situated between the two ilrs associated with the primary bar potential , in agreement with numerical simulations ( piner et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "ngc 6574 is a little studied sabbc spiral galaxy at v@xmath10 = 2282 km s@xmath11 ( @xmath18 mpc ; 1@xmath13 = 160 pc ) .",
    "it is inclined at @xmath840@xmath16 and is not strongly interacting with any other major galaxy , as evidenced by the symmetric rotation curve ( demoulin & chan 1969 ) .",
    "its nucleus is classified as a seyfert 2 . around the nucleus , there is an sf region consisting of spiral arms in the form of a wide pseudoring .",
    "this ring contains @xmath830 h@xmath4 emission regions ( gonzlez  delgado et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the observations , data reduction and the evolutionary model used . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we discuss the morphology of the circumnuclear rings , determine the extinctions to the sf complexes from comparison of the recombination line strengths , and constrain their sf properties , stellar populations and sf history by a detailed comparison among the nir tracers and with the radio emission .",
    "we also discuss the origin of the h@xmath3 emission in the ring .",
    "general discussion and conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "the observations of the br@xmath1 2.1661  @xmath2 m and h@xmath3 10 s(1 ) 2.121  @xmath2 m emission lines and the @xmath0 bands were carried out in september 1998 with the 3.8 m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) on mauna kea , hawaii , under fwhm 0607 seeing .",
    "we used the 256@xmath19256 px ircam3 camera , with pixel size 0281 px@xmath11 and field of view @xmath20 . for the emission line observations , we used cooled ( @xmath21 77 k ) narrow  band filters and a fabry  perot ( f  p ) etalon with spectral resolution @xmath8400 km s@xmath11 and equivalent width ( ew ) 0.0038 @xmath2 m .    for both emission lines ,",
    "five 60 sec observations were made at each on  line ( ol ) wavelength and at the nearby blue ( bc ) and red ( rc ) continuum , shifted with respect to the line centre by @xmath22 km s@xmath11 , following the sequence ol  bc  ol  rc and moving the telescope by @xmath810@xmath13 in a five point grid between the individual integrations for sky subtraction .",
    "this sequence was repeated until a sufficent on  line integration time was achieved . for the @xmath0bands ,",
    "five 30 sec integrations were made both centered on the galaxy and on sky 5@xmath9 east .",
    "the total integration times for the @xmath0bands and for the and h@xmath3 emission lines are 150 , 1800 and 2400 sec ( ngc 1097 ) and 150 , 2400 and 2400 sec ( ngc 6574 ) .",
    "faint standard stars were observed in both broad  band and narrow  band filters immediately after the galaxy observations at similar airmass .       was used to reduce the observations .",
    "the line images were divided by a flatfield made from linearized galaxy images , and sky  subtracted using the median of the five images at the same wavelength .",
    "these images were then aligned by using the nuclear position as reference , and merged into one on  line image and two continuum images .",
    "the alignment of the images is accurate to within a fraction of a pixel .",
    "finally , the continuum images were scaled with the continuum / line ratio measured from a standard star , combined , and subtracted from the on  line images , and the final line images were flux calibrated against the spectral type a standard stars hd 1160 ( m@xmath23 = 7.040 ) and hd 201941 ( m@xmath23 = 6.626 ) .",
    "the reduction of the broad  band images consisted of linearization , flatfielding using a sky flat , and sky subtraction using the median of five sky images .",
    "ukirt faint standard stars fs 29 and fs 35 were used to flux calibrate the broad  band images .",
    "the sensitivity of the f  p is a function of both the line  of  sight ( l.o.s . )",
    "velocity of the galaxy and the shift in the transmitted wavelength of the f  p over the field of view .",
    "these effects were corrected for by dividing the measured fluxes by an inverse airy function ( see e.g. bland ",
    "hawthorn 1995 ) . for ngc 1097 , a high resolution l.o.s .",
    "velocity field exists ( storchi  bergmann et al .",
    "the only available l.o.s .",
    "velocity data for ngc 6574 were published by demoulin & chan ( 1969 ) , who find the velocity to be constant to within 20 km s@xmath11 at distances 6@xmath1318@xmath13 from the nucleus , i.e. encompassing the ring .",
    "therefore , we have assumed that the velocity depends only on the angle with respect to the line of nodes and the inclination . according to demoulin & chan ( 1969 ) ,",
    "the rotational amplitude is 240 km s@xmath11 , inclination 40@xmath16 and the position angle pa = 159@xmath16 . using these values ,",
    "we have estimated the velocity field in the sf ring . in the nucleus",
    ", we assumed the l.o.s .",
    "rotational velocity to be 0 km s@xmath11 .",
    "the emission linewidths would also need to be considered .",
    "this would , however , require information about the line profiles in different parts of the rings , which is not available .",
    "however , usually the spectral lines are rather narrow , and this correction is likely to be small . in this paper , the emission line _ images _ have not been corrected for by the inverse airy function , because then noise would depend on the position in the image .",
    "however , the observed emission line _ fluxes _ have been corrected for this effect .",
    "the observed line emission is weak , so to enhance the s / n , all images were smoothed to 1@xmath13 resolution .",
    "photometry in all bands was performed at the location of the detected emission regions .",
    "the aperture used for each region was selected to include as much as possible of the radiation , while avoiding overlap with neighbouring regions . the smallest distance between the nearest emission regions in these galaxies",
    "is @xmath82@xmath13 , which is larger than the resolution of the smoothed images ( @xmath81@xmath13 ) and much larger than the seeing during the observations ( @xmath806 ) .",
    "the observed fluxes were corrected for galactic extinction ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) and redshift ( k  correction ) .",
    "we estimate a photometric accuracy in the @xmath0 magnitudes of @xmath80.03 mag , in the @xmath0 colours of @xmath80.05 mag , and in the emission line fluxes of @xmath810 % .",
    "optical observations of starburst regions are much more hampered by the large and spatially variable extinction than observations in the nir ( a@xmath23 @xmath80.1 a@xmath5 ) .",
    "the derived extinction depends on the assumed geometry of the absorbing dust with respect to the emission region . in this paper",
    "we assume for the sake of simplicity and for easy comparison with previous determinations , the case of a foreground screen of dusty cloud filaments .",
    "the true dust distribution is , however , probably clumpy and mixed with the star clusters , resulting in a somewhat larger extinction .",
    "therefore , the derived extinction values should be treated as approximations only .",
    "note that the exact value of extinction does not affect the ews of the emission lines , if the differential extinction between the lines and the continuum is small , as is usually the case in the nir ( calzetti 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "assuming standard interstellar dust properties , case b recombination ( intrinsic @xmath24 ; osterbrock 1989 ) , and the landini et al .",
    "( 1984 ) interstellar extinction curve , @xmath25 , extinction towards the ionized sources can be determined from the observed br@xmath1 and h@xmath4 fluxes .",
    "this extinction strictly refers only to the ionized gas .",
    "the extinction experienced by the continuum can be estimated by comparing the observed broad ",
    "band colours of the emission regions to the average colours of normal unobscured spiral galaxies ( @xmath26 = 0.75 , @xmath27 = 0.22 ; glass & moorwood 1985 ) .",
    "this method , however , may be biased toward low extinction regions , as the most heavily reddened regions may not be detectable in the @xmath0 images . also , the intrinsic colours of the galaxies may be bluer than in normal galaxies , leading to an underestimation of the continuum extinction .      to interpret the sf properties , we have used the stellar population synthesis model of leitherer et al .",
    "( 1999 ; hereafter l99 ) , which employs the latest stellar evolutionary tracks ( e.g. charbonnel et al . 1999 ) and stellar atmosphere models ( e.g. lejeune , buser & cuisinier 1997 ) .",
    "it predicts the evolution of a large number of nir , optical and uv spectral features as a function of the burst age , metallicity , and the initial mass function ( imf ) with lower and upper mass cutoff and slope @xmath4 , for the limiting cases of instantaneous burst of sf ( isf ) and constant sf rate ( csfr ) .",
    "the ew of br@xmath1 , which is sensitive to the age of the starburst , was estimated by subtracting a de vaucouleurs bulge model ( depicting the old stellar population ) from the @xmath28band image and dividing the br@xmath1 fluxes with the remaining @xmath28band fluxes .",

    "note that our general conclusions remain unchanged if one uses other evolutionary models , e.g. those of cervino & mas  hesse ( 1994 ) or lancon & rocca  volmerange ( 1996 ) .",

    "ngc 1808 has a nuclear starburst with a possible weak seyfert , and its morphology is rather smooth .",
    "the circumnuclear ring of ngc 1097 with a weak seyfert / liner nucleus is very clumpy , while the rings in the strong seyferts ngc 6574 and ngc 7469 are rather smooth .",
    "finally , ngc 1068 with a strong seyfert nucleus has a clumpy ring morphology .",
    "a stronger inverse correlation is , on the other hand , found between the strength of the agn and the strength of the bar .",
    "all three galaxies with a strong agn ( ngc 1068 , ngc 6574 and ngc 7469 ) have a rather weak primary bar , whereas the four galaxies with a strong bar ( ngc 1097 , ngc 1808 , ngc 7552 and ngc 7771 ) have either a weak or no agn .",
    "this relationship agrees with the paucity of strong nuclear bars in agn ( regan & mulchaey 1999 ) and argues against the @xmath9bars within bars@xmath9 scenario ( shlosman et al .",
    "1989 ) as the primary fuelling mechanism of nuclear activity",
    ". however , seyfert galaxies have large ",
    "scale bars more often than non  active galaxies ( knapen et al .",
    "1999 ) , therefore a much larger sample of barred galaxies with circumnuclear rings is needed to study the implications of this correlation for the fuelling of agn .",
    "the united kingdom infrared telescope is operated by the joint astronomy centre on behalf of the u.k . particle physics and astronomy research council .",
