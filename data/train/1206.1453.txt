    "despite the hint for a light higgs boson at 125 gev  @xcite , there has been keen interest in the search of new heavy chiral quarks at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , resulting in the stringent limit of @xmath6 gev / c@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "this is already above the perturbative , tree - level partial wave unitarity bound ( ub ) that is nominally around 550 gev / c@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "thus , if such heavy quarks exist , their yukawa couplings would already be in the strong coupling regime .",
    "with tev scale heavy quark masses , the actual ub violation ( ubv ) in the high energy limit for @xmath12 scattering may be out of reach .",
    "instead , the question to ask is : _ should the current search strategy for ultraheavy quark @xmath0 at the lhc be modified ? _ in this note we draw on the analogy of the proton to argue that @xmath4 ( @xmath14 is the longitudinal component of the vector boson ) may be the new signature at the lhc .    the @xmath2 coupling @xmath15  @xcite gives @xmath16 , which is very large and quite close to the @xmath2  yukawa coupling \" , @xmath17 .",
    "although @xmath18 ( @xmath19 gev is the electroweak symmetry breaking scale ) from the current @xmath20 bound is not yet as large , drawing analogy with @xmath21 annihilation , we expect that @xmath4 may be the dominant process for @xmath7 gev .",
    "let us briefly review the observed phenomena regarding @xmath21 annihilation , which is well known  @xcite to go mainly via a  fireball \" into @xmath5 pions .",
    "the salient features of the annihilation ",
    "fireball \" are ( see fig .",
    "1 ) :    * size of order @xmath23 ; * temperature @xmath24 mev ; * average number of emitted pions @xmath25 ; * a soft - pion @xmath26 factor modulates the maxwell  boltzman distribution for the pions .    -36 mm    it is worthwhile to elucidate these features a little further .",
    "the size @xmath23 means that the @xmath21 annihilation system , destined to shed the @xmath27 and @xmath28 content , extends over a region @xmath29 .",
    "the system seems to thermalize to a temperature of order 120 mev , hence  loses memory \" of its origins , and the emitted pions carry momenta that satisfy a thermal distribution .",
    "this rapid thermalization probably takes place due to the rather large @xmath2 ( as well as @xmath30 ) coupling , while the @xmath26 suppression  @xcite ( satisfied rather well by data ; see fig .",
    "12 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) for low pion momentum from the thermal distribution reflects the goldstone nature of pion couplings .",
    "that is , the @xmath31 as goldstone boson couples derivatively , hence can not get emitted at zero momentum .",
    "this seems to explain the enhancement factor of 1.3 for the mean kinetic energy @xmath32 beyond equipartition expectation of @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the relatively high @xmath34 mev gives rise to @xmath35 , as compared to the maximal allowed number of pions , @xmath36 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     at a more refined level , it is found that @xmath37 and @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , i.e. more neutral pions are emitted than charged ones .",
    "furthermore , the pion multiplicity distribution appears gaussian , @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "more specifically  @xcite , @xmath42 is argued from statistical models  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath43 gives a good fit to data  @xcite , which is given in table  i. note the rather small @xmath44 2-body fraction , and the cutoff of pion multiplicity above 8 .",
    "this successful  statistical model \" which accounts for gross features of @xmath22 annihilation goes back to fermi  @xcite , who considered a system of noninteracting pions .",
    "it has been refined through the years , and the strong interactions of the pions do play a role .",
    "one final aspect is a focusing of incoming waves by attractive potential that leads to strong absorption in a smaller region than originally suggested .",
    "we mean by @xmath0 a left - handed chiral doublet ( with corresponding right - handed weak singlets ) that is degenerate in mass , thereby possessing a _ heavy isospin _ symmetry @xmath46 , much like the nucleon @xmath47 .",
    "this is nothing but the 4th generation  @xcite . to draw true analogy with the @xmath2 case ,",
    "the @xmath3 yukawa coupling @xmath48 should be of order 1314 , i.e. @xmath49 tev .",
    "however , we will assume that analogous phenomena already appears for 1 tev , hence we will consider @xmath7 tev .",
    "with higgs mechanism already established , the goldstone boson @xmath14 carries a length @xmath50  @xcite , which defines the _ size _ of the @xmath12 annihilation fireball . besides the dynamical mechanism for @xmath51 and @xmath20 generation , comparing @xmath52 with @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the weak gauge coupling ,",
    "the size of the fireball is in part determined by unrelated ,  random \" parameters .",
    "the fireball temperature @xmath55 is harder to assess . noting that @xmath56 , likely @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the electroweak transition temperature . by this analogy",
    ", however , one notes that @xmath59 arises from the detailed underlying theory for hadron phenomena ( which includes @xmath22 ) , qcd .",
    "even though we believe ew symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) probably  @xcite arises from strong yukawa coupling , @xmath48 , we do not yet have an underlying theory for @xmath48 itself .",
    "thus , we do not have a good handle on @xmath60 , except that it is in the 100 gev scale , of order @xmath61 .",
    "we shall therefore take as nominal @xmath62 which can be interpreted as either @xmath63 ( here 1.3 corresponds to @xmath64 ) , or @xmath65 .",
    "the latter would give 170 gev , which is not so different from eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) .",
    "we stress , however , that the fireball temperature could be 1.5 , even twice as high , and should be determined eventually by experiment .",
    "the goldstone @xmath66 factor should still modulate the thermal @xmath67 distribution .",
    "but because of the smallness of @xmath68 compared with @xmath69 , the modulation is considerably milder than the @xmath22 case , so @xmath70 should be closer to @xmath33 .    assuming eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) but without applying the 1.3 enhancement factor over equipartition ( as is the case for @xmath22 ) , we take @xmath71 gev , hence @xmath72 gev , or @xmath73 with @xmath74 . for @xmath75 tev , or @xmath76 tev",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath77 where we artificially keep three digits of significance for generating a  realistic \" multiplicity distribution .",
    "assuming eqs .",
    "( [ pnpi ] ) and ( [ sigma ] ) , we have @xmath78 , and the multiplicity distribution is @xmath79 for @xmath75 tev .",
    "we note that a higher fireball temperature @xmath60 would result in lower @xmath8 , higher @xmath80 and a narrower distribution ( controlled by @xmath81 ) .",
    "we illustrate the @xmath4 process in fig .  1 ( gluon emission discussed later ) , and tabulate the multiplicity distributions in table i. for @xmath82 tev , about 90% of @xmath12 annihilations go into 58 prongs of @xmath83 .",
    "several @xmath84s should be considerably above 300 gev momentum , while 4-prong events ( at 6% ) are in general composed of @xmath84s with momentum @xmath85 500 gev .",
    "therefore , @xmath86-tagged  fat \" jets , @xmath87 , should become a useful tool for identifying these multi-@xmath84 events . for @xmath88 tev ,",
    "again over 90% of @xmath12 annihilations go into 1015 prong @xmath84s , which is a rather large number . for 912 prong events ( at @xmath89 ) ,",
    "a significant number of @xmath84s would have momentum above 400 gev , while for higher multiplicity , many should still carry momentum higher than the mean , eq .",
    "( [ pg ] ) .",
    "these high multiplicity @xmath90 events would be possible hallmark for heavy @xmath12 production .",
    "if our analogy with @xmath21 annihilation is already realized for @xmath82 tev , then even at 8 tev running of lhc , where of order 15 fb@xmath91 data is expected in 2012 , one could already get a hint .",
    "the cross section is of order a couple fb , so one might observe some number of 4 or more @xmath86-tagged jet ( @xmath87 ) events , with additional jet multiplicity that are less well @xmath86-tagged .",
    "the competing modes would be regular @xmath12 production , followed by  free quark decay \" , e.g. ( assuming @xmath92 ) @xmath93 , or @xmath94  @xcite ; we shall assume ckm hierarchy for simplicity .",
    "we see that the @xmath86-jet multiplicity is lower , associated with isolated high @xmath95 @xmath96-jets , and practically no @xmath97-jets  @xcite or @xmath98 .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "@xmath45 does not have isolated @xmath96-jets ( @xmath96-jets would come in pairs at lower fraction , to form a @xmath99 from @xmath100 ) , @xmath86-jet multiplicity is higher , and tend to have @xmath97-jets  @xcite .",
    "we expect the @xmath45 fireball process would dominate over the @xmath101 free quark decay process , as we would argue shortly .",
    "there are arguments that , if the heavy chiral quarks @xmath0 themselves are responsible  @xcite for ewsb , then @xmath102 tev is likely  @xcite .",
    "our earlier analogy with the @xmath2  yukawa \" coupling suggests @xmath103 tev .",
    "if so , the prospect for the 2012 lhc run at 8 tev is not good , and one would have to wait for the 1314 tev run , expected by late 2014 . running the hathor code  @xcite for @xmath12 production , we estimate the 14 tev cross sections to be of order 5060 fb for @xmath82 tev , dropping to @xmath104 fb for @xmath105 tev , and 0.20.3 fb for @xmath88 tev . from @xmath106 to 4 tev , one quickly runs out of parton luminosity .",
    "note that @xmath107 production dominates over @xmath108 production , as the valence quark supplies the needed large parton momentum fraction .    from the cross section and expected lhc luminosities , for @xmath109 tev , again we do not foresee a problem for discovery .",
    "note that , assuming @xmath46 symmetry , i.e. near degeneracy of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , then    * @xmath110 decay : + suppressed by both phase space and small goldstone momentum ; * @xmath111 : + suppressed by ckm element @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "+ with no sign of new physics in @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 , one expects  @xcite such ckm elements to be less than 0.1 .",
    "in contrast , once @xmath107 pulls the heavy quark pair out of the vacuum , the @xmath12 pair  sees \" a cross section of order @xmath117 , which is at the @xmath118b level . with @xmath107 production ,",
    "there is yukawa attraction  @xcite between @xmath12 that mimics the focusing attraction for @xmath22 .",
    "thus , there is good likelihood that @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath90 , would dominate over free quark decay .",
    "we comment that the produced @xmath12 is likely in a color - octet state , hence in general it would need to shed color .",
    "however , gluons have no way to sense the @xmath119 gev ( or higher ) of the fireball , which is of electroweak nature",
    ". instead , the heaviness of @xmath0 means gluon radiation is @xmath120 suppressed ( heavy quark symmetry ) .",
    "we illustrate gluon radiation in fig .  1 , but expect the associated gluon - jet to be soft and does not provide a discriminant . since the fireball is viewed as a nonperturbative process , it is hard to assess how this gluon is actually radiated .",
    "a natural question is whether the annihilation gets modified by heavy @xmath0 motion . here ,",
    "@xmath21 annihilation data again provide a guide . fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite illustrates , for example , that for @xmath121 ( lab frame ) , the annihilation cross section @xmath122 predominates the total cross section @xmath123 .",
    "in fact , @xmath122 always dominate over the elastic cross section @xmath124 even for @xmath125 greater than several times @xmath51 . only for @xmath126",
    "does the inelastic @xmath127 become significant , dominating beyond @xmath128 or so . for our purpose",
    ", we expect annihilation , in the way we discussed , to be dominant before the motion turns rather relativistic .",
    "if one really has a collider of much higher energy , then @xmath12 scattering becomes an issue related to ubv .",
    "if the analog to @xmath129 implies subsequent free @xmath0 decay , then one might still observe free quark decay .",
    "the question of how @xmath0 decays in large yukawa coupling limit needs to be investigated nonperturbatively .    in case",
    "@xmath130 tev , one quickly runs out of parton luminosities ( higher energy would be preferred ! ) , hence one would need high luminosity running of lhc at 14 tev .",
    "however , the situation need not be so pessimistic : the very large yukawa coupling suggests the existence of bound states below @xmath131 .",
    "for example , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is likely an isosinglet , color - octet @xmath132 resonance that can be produced via @xmath133 .",
    "how @xmath132 decays would depend on more details of the @xmath12 bound state spectrum and properties .",
    "the beauty of our analogy with @xmath22 annihilation is precisely the thermal nature of this fireball process  @xcite , with little  remembrance \" , either of the initial @xmath21 state , or detailed resonances in the hadron spectrum .",
    "thus , we make no assertion on @xmath132 decay properties here , except that it offers hope for an enhanced production cross section .",
    "if the decay of the @xmath132 is analogous to the fireball picture , then by @xmath134 and the resonance production nature , there is good hope for earlier discovery . if @xmath132 decays through similar chains as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , then it might lead to the discovery of several resonances .",
    "the study of ref .",
    "@xcite was done with 500 gev @xmath135 gev in mind , to avoid issues of boundstate collapse  @xcite .",
    "but since this region is now close to being ruled out , a numerical update , in particular also on obtaining the spectrum , is certainly called for .",
    "this would require nonperturbative solutions for strong yukawa coupling .",
    "an offshoot study of ref .",
    "@xcite provides an interesting contrast .",
    "if free quark decay is suppressed by very small @xmath136 , and some kinematic selections are operative , it is argued that @xmath137 ( @xmath138 is some isotriplet , color - octet yukawa - bound  meson \" ) , followed by @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is transverse , with the upshot of @xmath141 .",
    "this is an exception to our fireball discussion , in that 1 )  it is effectively 2-body in vector bosons ( @xmath142 ) ; 2 )  the gluon is energetic . if reconstructed  @xcite , one could discover _ two _ resonances .",
    "these signatures arise from special conditions that are unlikely to hold in general .",
    "multiple weak boson production has been considered below @xmath12 threshold  @xcite .",
    "there is a rise of high multiplicities as one starts to approach threshold of high @xmath20 .",
    "but that would be out of the range of validity for the @xmath143 amplitude via virtual @xmath0 loop considered .",
    "we remark that our multi-@xmath84 signature is in principle quite distinct from micro - blackhole production  @xcite .",
    "micro - blackholes in essence emit all types of particles democratically .",
    "in contrast , our fireball is heated in the electroweak sense , and by far prefers emitting the strongly coupled weak goldstone bosons @xmath83",
    ". however , since searches so far are based only on the simplified signature of high jet multiplicities , a refined search is needed to separate micro - blackholes from @xmath12 fireballs .",
    "a final remark is in regards @xmath144 scattering .",
    "if a very heavy chiral quark doublet @xmath0 exists above the tev scale , it would not be easily compatible with a light higgs because of the very large quadratic corrections to the light higgs mass .",
    "a corollary of our argument would then suggest that the traditional @xmath145 scattering study for heavy higgs case may be the wrong place to search for new physics enhancement .",
    "instead , one should again watch out for @xmath144 scattering to high(er ) multiplicity of @xmath84s  @xcite . in general",
    ", one should treat the ubv in @xmath144 and @xmath12 scattering as one single problem .    in conclusion , the ever - increasing mass bound on heavy sequential chiral quark @xmath0 , and the associated question of whether there might be a need to change the search strategy , prompt us to draw analogy with the observed @xmath22  fireball \" annihilation .",
    "we suggest that , in the range of @xmath7 tev , @xmath12 might annihilate via an analogous fireball into @xmath5 goldstone , or longitudinal vector bosons , with mean multiplicity @xmath8 ranging from @xmath146 to over 10 .",
    "the mean multiplicity @xmath8 is correlated with the fireball  temperature \" @xmath60 , which are the key parameters for experiment to measure .",
    "this process would at least dilute the usual free quark decay picture for on - shell @xmath12 production .",
    "strong yukawa boundstates below @xmath131 should further aid the discovery of new heavy chiral quarks , and the prospect appears optimistic beyond the unitarity bound .",
