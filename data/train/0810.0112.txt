    "events with a baryon carrying a large fraction of the proton beam energy have been observed in @xmath0 scattering at hera  @xcite .",
    "the dynamical mechanisms for their production are not completely understood .",
    "they may be the result of hadronization of the proton remnant , leaving a baryon in the final state .",
    "exchange of virtual particles is also expected to contribute . in this picture",
    ", the target proton fluctuates into a virtual meson - baryon state . the virtual meson scatters with the projectile lepton , leaving the fast forward baryon in the final state .",
    "leading neutron ( ln ) production occurs through the exchange of isovector particles , notably the @xmath1 meson . for leading proton ( lp )",
    "production isoscalar exchange also contributes , including diffraction mediated by pomeron exchange . in the exchange picture , the cross section for some process in @xmath0 scattering with e.g. ln production factorizes : here @xmath2 is the flux of virtual pions in the proton , @xmath3 is the fraction of the proton beam energy carried by the neutron , and @xmath4 is the virtuality of the exchanged pion .",

    "this result suggests the validity of factorization , i.e. independence of the photon and the proton vertices .",
    "the factorization relation can be rewritten replacing the cross sections by @xmath16 and @xmath6 . using the measurement of @xmath17 for @xmath18 , and the integral over @xmath4 of the pion flux factor at the center of this @xmath9 range , @xmath19",

    "the results are consistent with a previous zeus measurement  @xcite .",
    "the data are compared to predictions of parameterizations of the pion structure function  @xcite , and to the h1 - 2000 parameterization of the proton structure function  @xcite multiplied by the factor 2/3 according to naive expectation based on the number of valence quarks in the pion and proton respectively .",
    "the distributions show a steep rise with decreasing @xmath23 , in accordance with the pion and the proton structure function parameterizations .",
    "the scaled proton structure function gives the best description of the data .",
    "the energy dependences of hadronic total cross sections can be described simply as the sum of two powers :  @xcite , where @xmath24 is the hadron - hadron center - of - mass energy .",
    "the term with power @xmath25 is from pomeron exchange and is expected to be universal for all hadron - hadron reactions .",
    "this has been studied at hera in the @xmath26 total cross section , where the photon fluctuates into a virtual hadron .",
    "previous hera measurements had only one cross section measurement at high @xmath24 , and required results from lower @xmath24 fixed - target experiments to extract @xmath27 .    at the end of hera",
    "running the proton beam energy was lowered to half of its nominal value .",
    "zeus took data for @xmath26 total cross section measurements at both energies , identifying photoproduction events with a positron tagger . at these high values of @xmath24 the term with power @xmath28 can be neglected , and @xmath27 can be extracted from the ratio of @xmath29 at two energies . by making the measurement with the same apparatus , many acceptances and systematic effects in the ratio cancel .",
    "the value extracted from the preliminary zeus measurement is @xmath30 , consistent with the value @xmath31 extracted from low - energy data  @xcite .",
    "the error on the zeus value will be reduced , leading to an independent measurement of the high energy dependence of hadronic total cross sections with one apparatus ."
