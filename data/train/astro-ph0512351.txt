    "in stark contrast to most of the taurus - auriga star formation complex , which is characterized by very low efficiency formation of isolated stars ( palla & stahler 2002 ) , the l1551 molecular cloud has sustained a long and continuing period of star formation of relatively high efficiency .",
    "the cloud is surrounded by a halo of at least 30 classical and weak t tauri stars ( ctts , wtts ) and proto - brown dwarfs ( cudworth & herbig 1979 ; jones & herbig 1979 ; feigelson & decampli 1981 ; feigelson & kriss 1983 ; wood _ et al . _  1984 ; feigelson _ et al . _  1987",

    "2004 ) , indicating star formation activity over the past few million years .",
    "embedded within the cloud are two known groups of active star formation , one comprised of irs5 and l1551-ne ( hereafter ne ) , and the other the hl  tau group , located @xmath35  north of irs5 and consisting of hl  tau , xz  tau , lkh@xmath1 358 , and hh  30*. ( in the following discussion , hh  30 refers to the herbig - haro object(s ) , while hh  30 * ( also known as v1213 tau ) refers to the driving star . )",
    "the question remains , will this sustained star formation continue beyond the present epoch , and what is the reason for this sustained activity ?",
    "ldn 1551 ( lynds 1962 ) , a modest - sized ( @xmath4 50 , diameter @xmath5 1 pc ) ( moriarty - schieven & snell 1988 ) dark cloud , lies directly behind the hyades star cluster in taurus .",
    "its distance was recently constrained using hipparchos observations by bertout , robichon & arenou ( 1999 ) , who determined that the average distance to the taurus - auriga complex was 139@xmath6 pc , but found the distance to t tauri ( which is much nearer to l1551 than the rest of the tau - aur complex ) to be 168@xmath7 pc . extended optical emission from l1551",
    "was first discovered on photographic plates and cataloged as the diffuse [ hii ]  region s239 ( sharpless 1959 ) .",
    "this emission was later found to exhibit characteristics of a herbig - haro object ( shock excited optical emission powered by outflows from young stars ) and re - categorized as hh  102 ( strom , grasdalen , & strom 1974 ) .",
    "three bright and compact hh objects , hh  28 , hh  29 , and hh  30 , were also found in the region ( herbig 1974 ) .",
    "they were at first mis - identified as high velocity stars due to their high proper motions ( luyten 1963 , 1971 ) .",

    "1995 ) .",
    "new aspects of the l1551 star forming region continue to be uncovered as deep optical images , high angular resolution radio continuum maps , and other studies are obtained .",
    "high angular resolution radio continuum maps have shown that irs  5 , an _ fu ori _ type class i protostar ( sandell & weintraub 2001 ) , is a binary ( rodriguez _ et al . _",

    "deep optical imaging , proper motion studies , and spectroscopy have provided evidence that the nearby yso l1551  ne , a class 0 protostar ( moriarty - schieven , butner & wannier 1995 ) discovered by emerson _",
    "et al . _  ( 1984 ) , located about 1  to the east of irs  5 , may power the bright herbig - haro object hh  29 and possibly hh  28 ( devine , reipurth , & bally 2000 ; hartigan et al .",
    "2000 ) along with a highly collimated 1.5 parsec - long chain of fainter herbig - haro objects that are superimposed on the main co lobes of the l1551 outflow complex .",
    "the ne source is also a multiple system ( rodriguez , anglada & raga 1995 ; moriarty - schieven _",
    "et al . _  2000 ) , and possesses a molecular outflow ( moriarty - schieven , butner & wannier 1995 ) , although the outflow is aligned with and hence confused by that of irs5 .",
    "associated with irs5/ne is another low - velocity molecular outflow , the l1551 e - w flow ( moriarty - schieven & wannier 1991 ; pound & bally 1991 ) , which extends @xmath330nearly due west of irs5/ne , but whose origin is unknown .",
    "near hl  tauri is a compact group of four or five ysos , of which all but one have outflows and/or jets ( mundt , buhrke & ray 1988 ) .",
    "deep images obtained through narrow - band interference filters transmitting the light of h@xmath1and [ sii ]  show that the nearby sources hl and xz  tau and the source of the hh  30 stellar jet power optically visible herbig - haro flows which also criss - cross the irs  5 outflow lobes ( devine , reipurth , & bally 1999 ) .",
    "several molecular outflows have also been detected toward this group ( monin , pudritz & lazareff 1996 ) .",

    "850 @xmath0 m   and 450 @xmath0 m   continuum data were obtained using the scuba bolometer array ( holland et al .",

    "in addition to these data , the scuba archive was `` mined '' for all observations ( pointing , calibration , mapping , etc . )",

    "the data were flux calibrated using the archival values derived by jenness _",
    "et al . _  ( 2002 ) .",
    "images were reconstructed using a matrix inversion method described by johnstone et al .",
    "the reconstructed images are , however , still subject to large - scale `` features '' which are artifacts of the reconstruction and may not be real .",

    "the 450 @xmath0 m   image is shown in figure [ 450um ] .",
    "because of archive data mining , some portions of the region , particularly toward hl  tau ( which is a scuba secondary flux calibrator ) , have been observed multiple times , and hence the rms noise of the final image is significantly lower in these locations . in figure [ 850um - var ] we show a greyscale image of the variance across the image , with contours at 10 mjy beam@xmath13 intervals .",
    "( note that the variance towards hl  tau , irs 5 and ne has been skewed by the brightness of the sources . ) in the @xmath35@xmath105  region centered on hl  tau , the rms is @xmath32 mjy beam@xmath13 , towards irs5/ne the rms is @xmath36 mjy beam@xmath13 , and throughout much of the rest of the image the variance is @xmath310 mjy beam@xmath13 . at 450 @xmath0 m",

    "continuum ( centered on 7732with a fwhm of 1546 ) images were also obtained , but will be presented in another paper .    in order to increase our observing efficiency , we opted not to take a set of five images in the standard mosdither pattern which is normally used to eliminate cosmic rays and the gaps between the individual chips in the mosaic camera .",
    "instead , we took a single image in each filter for each pointing . as a result of this observing strategy ,",
    "most of our images still contain chip gaps , resulting in a loss of approximately 3% of the area coverage at each pointing .",
    "however , using this strategy , we were able to effectively cover a 7.5 square degree area in our allotted three nights .",
    "images were overscanned , trimmed , bias subtracted , and flat fielded ( using dome flats ) in the standard manner using the mscred package in iraf .",
    "cosmic rays were removed using crnebula . because we used single exposures in much of the survey",
    ", the images may contain a small number of cosmic rays which were not eliminated by the crnebula task , however we can safely distinguish the cosmic rays from objects by their morphology : cosmic rays have sharp edges and are often only one pixel in extent .",
    "we used the procedures msccmatch , mscimage , and mscimatch to remove relative distortions , generate a single extension fits image , and match the sky background between images .",
    "for the pointings for which we obtained multiple images in each filter in a dither pattern , we used the mscstack procedure to combine all images in each filter into a single image which eliminates the gaps between ccd chips .",

    "co j=2 - 1 observations were obtained at the ( former ) national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) 12 meter diameter cassegrain radio telescope located on kitt peak arizona in january and february of 1997 .",

    "the 200 to 265  ghz sis receiver had a single - sideband receiver noise temperature of about 200  k providing a system temperature around 500  k. this dual channel receiver acquires data in two orthogonal polarization states simultaneously .",
    "the system back - end consisted of a 768  channel hybrid spectrometer with each channel delivering a bandwidth of 195.3  khz for a total bandwidth of about 150  mhz . at 230  ghz this corresponds to 0.25  per channel and an overall bandwidth of 192  .",
    "spectra were acquired using on - the - fly ( otf ) mapping , wherein the telescope is rastered rapidly across the sky while data and antenna position information are recorded at a 10  hz rate ( mangum 1997 ) .",

    "the telescope pointing was checked several times during each observing session and the carbon star irc+10216 was used as an absolute intensity calibration source .",
    "the telescope raster orientation was chosen to be either aligned with or orthogonal to a position angle of 60which is close to the orientation of the irs  5 outflow . each field",

    "this artifact is produced by high order baseline ripples and calibration differences between receivers .",
    "the striping was partially eliminated by cross - calibration of orthogonal scans ( ` basket weaving ' ) and by fitting higher order baselines to the data .",
    "the entire data set was reduced using the aips data reduction package .",

    "we have analyzed the relatively few available @xmath27co 3 - 2 spectra taken with the jcmt and determine that the typical integrated line strength in the outflow lobes is @xmath330 k km s@xmath13 .",
    "this agrees well with the mapped @xmath27co 2 - 1 observations presented in this paper .",
    "about one third of the integrated line strength is due to the underlying molecular cloud and varies only slightly across the region .",
    "this emission is chopped out of the scuba observations .",
    "the remaining @xmath320 k km s@xmath13 is highly variable on scales of less than two arcminutes and may contribute to the observed scuba flux . at this strength ,",
    "the co contamination is estimated to produce @xmath315 mjy beam@xmath13 of contaminated emission , compared with the typical 100 mjy beam@xmath13 measurement in the main l1551 lobe .",
    "thus , contamination , while not negligible , is not the main source of the observed scuba emission , except possibly in the very weak continuum emission joining irs5 and hh  102 , and toward the south limb of the southwest lobe .",
    "the continuum emission , therefore , most likely comes from swept up dust around the outflow lobe .",
    "deep narrow - band images and proper motion measurements of hh  29 show that it is likely to be powered by a bipolar hh flow from l1551  ne and _ not _ irs  5 as had previously been thought ( devine _ et al . _",
    "hh  29 lies within a few degrees of the axis of a blueshifted jet visible in the 1.644 @xmath0 m  line of [ fe ii ] that originates from l1551  ne and points towards the bow shock hh  29 .",
    "a chain of compact [ sii ]  emitting hh objects , hh  454 , lie along the axis of this jet ( figure [ billawal.fig11.ps ] ; devine , reipurth , & bally 1999 ) . extending this jet axis through hh  454a ( which can be seen in figure [ ne - sii-850 ] as a compact knot of [ sii ]  emission adjacent to ne to the south - west )",
    "intersects hh  28 and hh  29 . extending the axis to the north - east intersects hh  454b/454c ( seen in figure [ ne - sii-850 ] as slightly more diffuse knots @xmath30.7  and @xmath31  from ne ) and the weak bow shock of hh  262e at @xmath28 @xmath29 .    in figure [ ne - sii-850 ] , hh  262",
    "has clearly been detected at 850 @xmath0 m .",
    "in addition , a weak ridge of emission appears to connect the north rim of hh  262 with ne , similar to the ridge of emission connecting hh  102 to irs5 .",
    "this emission , however , is of order 70 mjy beam@xmath13 ; though contamination due to co emission may be significant at this intensity , there is little apparent co emission at this location ( figure [ co-850 ] ) .    given the roughly parallel jets from irs5 and ne , it is likely that the outflows from these sources are interacting with each other .",
    "moriarty - schieven , butner & wannier ( 1995 ) first detected the ne outflow , but because of limited mapping and confusion with the irs5 outflow they concluded that the blue - shifted outflow lobe was oriented to the northeast , i.e. toward hh  262 . in figure [ co-850 ] ( lower ) , however , the northeast lobe red - shifted emission peaks at ne , and appears as a limb - brightened ellipse with one end at ne , suggesting a significant amount of the red - shifted outflow originates from ne .",
    "the blue - shifted emission within the northeast lobe ( figure [ co-850 ] upper ) appears disconnected from ne , and may be from the near side of the outflow cavity .",
    "there is significant blue - shifted emission peaking at ne , but extending toward the southwest , as suggested by the fan - shaped reflection nebula in this direction ( graham & heyer 1990 ) .",
    "this suggests that the ne outflow is mostly parallel to that from irs5 .",
    "indeed , devine , reipurth & bally ( 1999 ) have proposed that hh  29 is driven by ne based on proper - motion studies , and note that a nearly straight line can be drawn connecting ne and hh  29 with hh  28 , hh  262 , and hh  286 .",
    "devine , reipurth & bally ( 1999 ) were uncertain whether ne or irs5 were the originating source of hh  262 based on their proper - motion studies , although the orientation was suggestive .",
    "lopez et al ( 1998 ) , also using proper motion and kinematic studies , concluded that the proper motion of this source was `` roughly '' away from irs5 .",
    "they dismissed the possibility that ne was the origin , however , only because moriarty - schieven , butner & wannier ( 1995 ) assumed the ne blue lobe were oriented to the north - east toward hh  262 , whereas the kinematics of the hh object were red - shifted .",
    "our new co data confirm that the outflow orientation is the correct direction for ne to be the origin of hh  262e , and , by extension , hh  286 . with hh  29 and",
    "possibly hh  28 and hh  259 originating from ne , the south limb of the blue - shifted outflow lobe may also originate from ne .",
    "the `` hollow shell '' morphology proposed for this outflow ( snell , loren & plambeck 1980 ; moriarty - schieven _",
    "et al . _",
    "1987,1988 ) , may instead be due to two interacting outflows .",
    "a third outflow originates from the region containing irs5 and l1551ne that extends due west from the l1551 cloud core ( figure [ co - chan ] , 8 - 12 km s@xmath13 ) .",
    "this feature , called the e  w flow ( moriarty - schieven & wannier 1991 ; pound & bally 1991 ) , is a 30   ( 1.0  pc ) long finger of redshifted gas at pa = 270   extending from near irs  5 toward the west with a maximum width of 0.1  pc . the e  w flow has a relatively small velocity extent ranging from about 6.5  to 11.0  and has no obvious blueshifted counterpart .",
    "ne was originally proposed as the origin for this outflow , but we see that this source powers an outflow parallel to that from irs5",
    ". however , l1551  ne may be a multiple star system ( rodriguez , anglada , & raga 1995 ; moriarty - schieven et al .",
    "2000 ) and the companion star may be a viable candidate to drive the e  w flow .",
    "the new co data shows that the eastern end of the e  w outflow lobe coincides with the northwestern rim of the main l1551 outflow shell and the herbig - haro object hh  102 .",
    "the lobe consists of a pair of nearly parallel filaments of emission which delineate the walls of a 0.1  pc wide cavity .",
    "the filaments converge to pinch the cavity about 17  west of irs  5 at the location of a relatively high velocity and bright knot of co ( l1551  w ; pound & bally 1991 ) .",
    "there is no known cloud core or iras source at this location .",
    "the e  w flow continues west of this knot as a narrow and fading co filament right to the boundary of the mapped region .",
    "visual wavelength and near - infrared imaging have failed to reveal any emission line objects associated with the e  w outflow lobe .",
    "figure [ sii - co-850 ] compares the 850 @xmath0 m , co outflows , and optical emission from the cloud .",
    "there is no sign of hh objects , etc .",
    ", within the outflow , or ( especially ) toward the high - velocity peak  20west of irs5 .",
    "unfortunately the 850 @xmath0 m  image does nt extend far enough west to tell if there is a continuum source at that position .",
    "thus our data do not resolve the origin of this outflow .      in figure [ sii ] , a dark ,",
    "heavily extincted bar can be seen extending @xmath316  north - west of irs5 . about half way along this bar",
    "lies a lone herbig - haro object , hh  265 , whose origin is unknown .",
    "we have detected 850 @xmath0 m  emission associated with this dark bar , in the neighborhood of hh  265 .",
    "the emission ( fig .",
    "[ 850um ] ) appears as a roughly elliptical , weakly centrally condensed core , with peak intensity @xmath30.2 jy beam@xmath13 , and integrated intensity @xmath34.5 jy at 850 @xmath0 m .",
    "the 850 @xmath0 m  continuum emission coincides with an nh@xmath30 clump discovered by swift , welch & di francesco ( 2005 ) ( figure [ mc - nh3-ccs - co ] ) , which they ve dubbed l1551-mc .",
    "their nh@xmath30 core is roughly of size 2.5@xmath101.11   ( 0.110@xmath100.054pc at 168pc distance ) aligned with the orientation of the dark bar , and has an average density of 10@xmath31 - 10@xmath32 cm@xmath13 , kinetic temperature of t@xmath34 9k , and total mass of @xmath35 ( swift , welch & di francesco 2005 ) .",
    "if we , too , assume a dust temperature of 9k , then we derive a mass of the clump of 2.6 m@xmath2 , which is very similar to their value .",
    "( using t@xmath36=20k gives 0.6 m@xmath2 ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) . )    the column density of dust emission peaks at the same location as nh@xmath30 emission peaks ( figure [ mc - nh3-ccs - co ] ) .",
    "swift , welch & di francesco ( 2005 ) found that ccs emission , conversely , was depleted toward the column density peak .",
    "they found no evidence for an embedded protostar , but did find that the kinematics of the ccs emission suggests that the outer regions , at least , of the core are undergoing infall .",
    "if this core is indeed infalling and eventually collapses , will this core form an isolated protostar or fragment into a small cluster of stars similar to the hl / xz  tau group ?",
    "the total mass still within the hl / xz  tau core is of order 1 m@xmath2 or so , although we are likely to have missed some emission because of chopping .",
    "the mass of stars is also of order 1 - 2 m@xmath2 , so roughly 50% of the mass has gone into protostars .",
    "if the l1551-mc core is similar , then @xmath31 m@xmath2 will form into protostars , enough mass to form several low - mass stars .",
    "there is no evidence from the nh@xmath30 data ( figure [ mc - nh3-ccs - co ] , magenta contours ) that the clump has begun to fragment , at least at the @xmath330  resolution of the observations .",
    "the @xmath314  resolution 850@xmath0 m data is lumpier , but the `` lumpiness '' is of the same order as the variance in this part of the image , and thus shows no evidence for fragmentation of the clump .",
    "the hh object hh  265 lies on the south - eastern end of the l1551-mc core ( figure [ mc - nh3-ccs - co ] ) .",
    "it is unlikely that the origin of this object lies within the clump , since the clump appears to be prestellar .",
    "furthermore the morphology of the hh object is that of a working surface ahead of a bow shock ( figure [ mc - nh3-ccs - co ] ) , with orientation of the complex extending north - eastward toward the hl  tauri group ( fig .",
    "[ hltau - sii-850 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we see weak blue - shifted co emission within the bow shock , extending still further north - east in the direction of the hl  tau group , one member of which must therefore be the source of this hh object .",
    "none of the known jets ( figure [ hltau - co - jets ] ) , however , is oriented in the direction of hh  265 , and all members of the group except lkh@xmath1358 are known to have jets . thus lkh@xmath1358 is a likely candidate for the origin of this hh object , although it must be noted that a plume of emission associated with lkh@xmath1358 ( fig .",
    "[ hltau - sii-850 ] ) is oriented nearly due west , and not in the direction of hh  265 .",
    "a line linking hh  265 with lkh@xmath1358 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ hh265-sii - halpha ] ) passes very near to two faint h@xmath1 emission knots at @xmath37 @xmath38 ( knot a in fig .",
    "[ hh265-sii - halpha ] ) and @xmath39 @xmath40 ( knot b ) . extending this line",
    "further intersects another knot of h@xmath1 emission at @xmath41 @xmath42 ( knot c ) .",
    "this line also comes very close to passing through hl  tau , and comes within only a few arcsec of xz  tau .",
    "if these emission features are related , it would indicate a new , previously unknown jet originating from lkh@xmath1358 , or possibly from the binary companion of xz  tau , or a currently unkown binary companion of hl  tau .",
    "in this paper , we present new sub - millimeter dust continuum maps and j=2 - 1 co images of the l1551 cloud in the taurus cloud complex .",
    "these data are combined with deep visual wavelength images and analyzed in the context of the extensive literature on this nearby star forming cloud .",
    "all previously known class 0 and class i ysos in l1551 are detected in the 850 @xmath0 m sub - mm continuum images . furthermore , no new compact sub - mm sources were found .",
    "thus , the inventory of highly embedded young stellar objects appears to be complete .",
    "however , it is possible that the known class 0/i protostars contain additional members which remain unresolved in our data .",
    "the compact sub - mm emitters are concentrated in two sub - clusters .",
    "the binary system irs5 , the most luminous and massive yso in l1551 , and the l1551-ne multiple system , are located near the southeastern end of the cloud .",
    "both members of irs5 and one member of the ne system power nearly parallel jets which appear to be collectively responsible for powering the main co outflow in this cloud . while the irs5 binary and its hh  154 jet clearly power hh  102 and the northern rim of the co outflow complex , ne is responsible for the highly collimated hh  454 jet and [ sii ]  knots , the bright hh object hh  29 , possibly hh  28 , the eastern portion of hh  262 , and possibly the distant bow shock hh  286 .",
    "thus , one member of the ne system is responsible for the southern portion of the main co outflow lobes .",
    "the driving source of the large redshifted east - west co lobe originating near hh  102 remains unclear .",
    "our scuba observations did not find any additional yso candidates along the axis of this outflow lobe .",
    "however , the orientation of this limb - brightened low - velocity outflow lobe suggests that the driving source may one member of the l1551-ne multiple star syst .",
    "the second sub - cluster of sub - mm emitters consists of the sources clustered around hl  tau ( hh  30 * , xz  tau , and lkh@xmath1  358 ) .",
    "all four of these ysos are associated with 850 @xmath0 m emission with hl  tau being by far the brightest .",
    "lkh@xmath1  358 ( or perhaps the binary companion of xz  tau or a currently unknown binary companion of hl  tau ) may be the origin of a jet terminating at hh  265 .",
    "a very weak molecular outflow was detected associated with the end of this jet .",
    "in addition to the compact sources , the sub - mm continuum emission exhibits diffuse components .",
    "ridges of 850 @xmath0 m emission extends from irs5 to hh  102 , from irs5 towards the axis of the southwestern co lobe , from irs5 towards ne , and from from ne towards hh  262 .",
    "the brightest parts of both hh  102 and hh  262 are detected at 850 @xmath0 m .",
    "although co j = 3 - 2 emission may make a small contribution to this emission , most of the flux is likely to be produced by warm dust entrained by outflows .",
    "a complex halo of dust emission also surrounds the hl  tau region .",
    "this extended emission may compromise the use of this yso as a secondary calibrator for sub - mm continuum observations .",
    "the l1551 cloud is cometary , indicating progressive erosion from the general direction of orion , located to the southeast .",
    "deep wide - field visual wavelength images and co maps show that the l1551 cloud has a cometary morphology consisting of a dense head near the irs5 / ne and hl  tau region , and a diffuse tail extending more than a degree towards the northwest .",
    "the densest part of this diffuse tail can be clearly seen in our [ sii ]  image ( figure 4 ) .",
    "diffuse 850 @xmath0 m dust emission is produced by this region , dubbed l1551-mc .",
    "this object is likely to be a pre - stellar core showing signs of undergoing the first phases of gravitational collapse ( swift , welch , & di francesco 2005 ) .",
    "we do not see any signs of fragmentation of the clump . assuming a dust temperature of 9 k",
    ", our sub - mm continuum flux implies a total mass of order 3 m@xmath2 .    the wide - field [ sii ]  image ( figure 4 )",
    "shows that the southeastern rim of the l1551 cloud is illuminated from the southeast .",
    "the co maps show that the cloud has a sharp edge in this direction .",
    "many background galaxies are visible beyond the southeastern edge of the cloud , indicating that this portion of the cloud has been dispersed .",
    "the locations of the older class ii and class iii ysos born from the l1551 cloud indicate that stars formed relatively recently southeast of the current cloud edge ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the cometary shape of the l1551 cloud , the projected distribution of older ysos , the faint glow along the southeastern rim of l1551 , and the location of l1551-mc northwest of the recently formed class 0/i ysos indicate that the l1551 cloud has been irradiated and eroded from the general direction of orion .",
    "the currently active sites of star formation in orion are located between 380 and 470 pc from the sun . however , the older sub - groups of the orion ob association are located closer with some members of the 1a and 1b subgroup as near as 300 pc , about 150 pc from l1551 ( de zeeuw et al 1999 ) . the closest portion of the orion - eridanus supershell , the h@xmath1 feature known as the eridanus loop ( reynolds , & ogden 1979 ; boumis et al .",
    "2001 ) , has been estimated to be only 160 pc from the sun ( burrows & guo 1996 ) , which places it within 50 pc of l1551 .",
    "portions of the 21 cm hi supershell driven by the orion ob association and 100 @xmath0 m dust emission traced by the iras satellite are located well outside the h@xmath1 loops illuminated by orion s massive stars ( e.g. brown , hartnamm , & burton 1995 ; heiles , haffner , & reynolds 1999 ) .",
    "the two well - known massive stars , betelgeuse and rigel , are located in the closer - parts of the orion - eridanus supershell and southeast of l1551 .",
    "betelgeuse , is about 130 pc from the sun and has an 18  proper motion towards pa @xmath3 68 .",
    "rigel is located 240 pc from the sun and illuminates a small complex of star - forming molecular clouds associated with ic 2118 in the southwester portion of orion ( kun et al .",
    ". the proper motion of betelgeuse ( 7.6 milliarcsec /year ) would place it southeast of l1551 several million years ago .",
    "thus , both of these massive stars could have been within 100 pc of the l1551 cloud within the last several million years and may have contributed to the photo - erosion of this cloud .    in summary , distribution of ysos , the cometary shape , the external illumination , and location of the pre - stellar core l1551-mc",
    "indicate that the evolution of the l1551 cloud has been influenced by massive stars and photo - erosion from the general direction of orion .",

    "<S> the l1551 molecular cloud , unlike most of the taurus molecular complex , is undergoing a long and sustained period of relatively high efficiency star formation . </S>",
    "<S> it contains two small clusters of class 0 and i protostars , as well as a halo of more evolved class ii and iii ysos , indicating a current and at least one past burst of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we present here new , sensitive maps of 850 and 450 @xmath0 m   dust emission covering most of the l1551 cloud , new co j=2 - 1 data of the molecular cloud , and a new , deep , optical image of [ sii ]  emission ( 6730 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have detected all of the previously known class 0 and i ysos in l1551 , and no new ones . </S>",
    "<S> compact sub - millimetre emitters are concentrated in two sub - clusters : irs5 and l1551ne , and the hl  tauri group . </S>",
    "<S> both stellar groups show significant extended emission and outflow / jet activity . </S>",
    "<S> a jet , terminating at hh  265 and with a very weak associated molecular outflow , may originate from lkh@xmath1  358 , or from a binary companion to another member of the hl  tauri group . </S>",
    "<S> several herbig haro objects associated with irs5/ne were clearly detected in the sub - mm , as were faint ridges of emission tracing outflow cavity walls . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm a large - scale molecular outflow originating from ne parallel to that from irs5 , and suggest that the `` hollow shell '' morphology is more likely due to two interacting outflows . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the e - w flow east of hh  102 is undetermined . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the presence of a prestellar core ( l1551-mc ) of mass 2 - 3 m@xmath2 north - west of irs5 . </S>",
    "<S> the next generation cluster may be forming in this core . </S>",
    "<S> the l1551 cloud appears cometary in morphology , and appears to be illuminated and eroded from the direction of orion , perhaps explaining the multiple episodes of star formation in this cloud .    </S>",
