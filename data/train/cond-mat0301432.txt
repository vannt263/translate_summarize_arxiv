    "<S> we studied local electronic states near zn in optimally doped yba@xmath0(cu@xmath1zn@xmath2)@xmath3o@xmath4 and underdoped yba@xmath0(cu@xmath1zn@xmath2)@xmath5o@xmath6 via satellite signals of plane - site cu(2 ) nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) spectra . from the relative intensity of cu nqr spectra , </S>",
    "<S> the satellite signals are assigned to zn - neighbor cu nqr lines . </S>",
    "<S> the cu nuclear spin - lattice relaxation time of the satellite signal is shorter than that of the main signal , which indicates that the magnetic correlation is locally enhanced near zn both for the underdoped and the optimally doped systems . </S>",
    "<S> the pure yba@xmath0cu@xmath5o@xmath6 is a stoichiometric , homogenous , underdoped electronic system ; nevertheless , the zn - induced inhomogeneous magnetic response in the cuo@xmath0 plane is more marked than that of the optimally doped yba@xmath0cu@xmath3o@xmath4 .    epsf.sty </S>"
