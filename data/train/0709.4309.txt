    "globular clusters ( gcs ) have been long recognized as an important tracer to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies . to solve the mystery of galaxy formation and evolution ,",
    "several photometric properties of the gcs such as color distribution , spatial structure , and luminosity function have been used @xcite . however , it is still difficult to test the predictions of the formation models of galaxies and their gc systems using photometric data alone .",
    "recently , with an aid of large telescopes with apertures larger than 4 meter , a large sample ( @xmath0 ) of gc spectra for one galaxy has been obtained , which can be used for statistically meaningful kinematic studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . due to their wide spatial distribution , brightness , and compact size ,",
    "gcs are useful test particles to trace the gravitational potential of their host galaxies , and especially of the dark matter halo beyond several effective radii of the galaxy .",
    "therefore , a kinematic study of the gc system enables us to estimate the global mass distribution of their host galaxy , or to constrain the orbital properties of gcs using an independently determined mass profile ( e.g. , from x - ray emission ) of the galaxy .",
    "moreover , the kinematic difference between gc subpopulations ( blue and red gcs ) can be used as an observational constraint on the galaxy formation model .",
    "to date there are six giant elliptical galaxies ( ges ) for which the kinematics of the gc system have been studied to our knowledge : m87 @xcite , m49 @xcite , ngc 1399 @xcite , ngc 5128 @xcite , ngc 4636 @xcite , and m60 @xcite .",
    "m87 , cd galaxy of the virgo cluster , was studied recently by @xcite using @xmath1 velocity data of gcs .",
    "the velocity dispersions of the blue and red gcs were found to be @xmath2410 km s@xmath3 and @xmath2390 km s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "both the blue and red gcs appear to rotate around the photometric minor axis with a similar rotation amplitude of @xmath4 km s@xmath3 when averaged over the whole system , while the blue gcs appear to rotate around the photometric major axis inside a radius of @xmath5 kpc .",
    "the entire gc system has an isotropic velocity ellipsoid , while the blue and red gc systems show tangentially and radially biased one , respectively .",
    "@xcite studied the gc kinematics of m49 , the brightest member of the virgo cluster , using @xmath6 velocity data of gcs .",
    "they found a larger velocity dispersion of the blue gcs ( @xmath2350 km s@xmath3 ) than that of the red gcs ( @xmath2270 km s@xmath3 ) . the blue gcs rotate roughly around the photometric axis of m49 with a rotation amplitude of @xmath7 km s@xmath3 , while the red gcs show some evidences for weak rotation ( @xmath8 km s@xmath3 ) around the same axis but a different direction .",
    "the entire , blue , and red gc systems appear to have an isotropic velocity ellipsoid .",
    "ngc 1399 , cd galaxy of the fornax cluster , was studied by @xcite with the largest number ( @xmath9 ) of gc velocity data .",
    "the velocity dispersions of the blue and red gcs were estimated to be @xmath2291 km s@xmath3 and @xmath2255 km s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "no significant rotations were found for both the blue and red gcs , while there is a weak signature of rotation for blue gcs beyond 6@xmath10 .",
    "the velocity anisotropies for both the blue and red gcs are consistent with isotropic orbits . using @xmath11 gc data of ngc 5128",
    ", @xcite found that the red gcs exhibit a significant rotation , while the blue gcs do not show a clear hint of rotation .",
    "later , @xcite , using 340 gc data for ngc 5128 , showed that the rotation amplitude and the velocity dispersion for the subsamples are quite similar .",
    "for ngc 4636 , @xcite found that the velocity dispersions of the blue and red gcs are not different , but the rotation of the red gcs is stronger than that of the blue gcs . in summary , all these gc systems show diverse gc kinematics in velocity dispersion , rotation , and their radial variation ( see section [ comp_ge ] ) , making it difficult to draw any strong conclusion on the uniform formation history of the gc system in ges .",
    "m60 ( ngc 4649 ) is a giant elliptical galaxy in the virgo cluster , slightly less luminous than m87 and m49 .",
    "m60 has a nearby companion sc galaxy , ngc 4647 , located at @xmath12 from the center of m60 .",
    "while there were numerous photometric studies of the gc system in m60 based on the ground - based images @xcite and hubble space telescope images @xcite , there were few spectroscopic studies of the m60 gc system @xcite .",
    "@xcite published for the first time the spectroscopic observational results for 38 gcs ( 16 blue and 22 red gcs ) in m60 using gemini / gmos .",
    "they found no obvious signs of a recent starburst , interaction or merger by estimating the ages and metallicities from the spectra of m60 gcs .",
    "later , @xcite investigated the kinematics of m60 gc system using the velocity data of @xcite .",
    "they reported that the velocity dispersion of the blue gcs is smaller than that of the red gcs unlike the cases of other ges .",
    "they found no hint of rotation in the gc system of m60 .",
    "furthermore , orbital distribution of the gc system is found to be close to isotropic inside the radius of 100@xmath13 , but becomes tangentially biased beyond this radius .",
    "however , due to their small number ( @xmath14 ) of gc velocity data with limited radial and azimuthal coverage , it was difficult to derive the kinematic properties up to several effective radii , and to distinguish the kinematic difference between the blue and red gcs .",
    "we have carried out a photometric study of the gc system in m60 using deep wide - field @xmath15 images obtained at the kpno 4 m telescope @xcite , and a spectroscopic study using the spectra obtained at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) ( * ? ? ?",

    "is given in the final section .",
    "we adopt a distance to m60 , 17.3 mpc , given by @xcite based on a surface brightness fluctuation method , and the corresponding scale for one arcmin is 5.032 kpc .",

    "we selected gc candidates in deep , wide - field washington c and @xmath16 images ( @xmath17 ) obtained at kpno 4 m telescope @xcite and f555w ( v ) and f814w ( i ) images in the hst / wfpc2 archive data @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations were made using the multi object spectrograph ( mos ) at the 3.6 m cfht in february 2002 and in may 2003 for 165 gc candidates with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we determined the radial velocities of gc candidates by cross - correlating the candidate spectrum with that of three galactic gcs . among 165 gc candidates",
    ", we could extract the spectra and determine the radial velocities for 111 objects , except for 54 objects due to the poor quality of their spectra .",
    "we increased the number of gcs by combining our data of radial velocities with those of @xcite .",
    "the radial velocities of gcs in @xcite were transformed into our velocity system using equation ( 1 ) in paper i , and the transformed velocities were used for further analysis . of the entire spectroscopic sample of gc candidates ( 110 from paper i and 38 from @xcite ) , 121 genuine gcs were selected in paper i using a criteria of radial velocities ( @xmath20 ) and ( @xmath21 ) colors ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "there are 83 blue gcs with @xmath23 and 38 red gcs with @xmath24 in the total sample .",
    "foreground reddening toward m60 is very small , @xmath25 @xcite , corresponding to @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .    in figure [ fig - vmap ]",
    ", we show the spatial distribution of 121 gcs in m60 with measured velocities .",
    "two large dotted ellipses represent isophotes at the 25.0 b - mag arcsec@xmath29 of m60 ( larger one ) and ngc 4647 ( smaller one ) @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the majority of high velocity gcs ( open symbols ) with larger velocities than the systemic velocity of m60 ( @xmath30 km s@xmath3 , paper i ) , appear to be located to the north - west of m60 . on the other hand",
    ", the majority of low velocity gcs ( filled symbols ) with smaller velocities than the systemic velocity of m60 appear to be located to the south - east of m60 .",
    "it might be related to the overall rotation of the m60 gc system around the minor axis . however , a careful analysis is needed for further dynamical investigation due to the non - uniform spatial coverage of observed genuine gcs around m60 .",
    "using the master catalog of 121 gcs in m60 ( paper i ) , we have investigated the kinematic properties of the m60 gc system : the rotation amplitude , the position angle of the rotation axis , the mean line - of - sight velocity , the projected velocity dispersion , and the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "a detailed description of the relation between the intrinsic rotational velocity field and the projected one is given in @xcite .",
    "in summary , if we assume that the gc system is spherically symmetric with an intrinsic angular velocity field stratified on spheres , and that the gc rotation axis lies in the plane of the sky , then we can find that radial velocities of gcs depend sinusoidally on the azimuthal angles .",
    "for the m60 gc system , the assumption of spherical symmetry of the gc system is reasonable due to the modest projected ellipticity ( effective ellipticity , @xmath31 , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we fit the observed line - of - sight velocities ( @xmath32 ) of the gcs with the function ,    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the projected position angle of gcs relative to the galaxy center measured from north to east , @xmath35 is the projected position angle of the rotation axis of the gc system , @xmath36 is the projected galactocentric distance , ( @xmath37 ) is the rotation amplitude , and @xmath38 is the systemic velocity of the gc system .    in figure  [ fig - rotsub ] , we plot the radial velocities of gcs with measured uncertainties as a function of position angle for entire 121 gcs ( top panel ) , 83 blue gcs ( middle panel ) , and 38 red gcs ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the best fit rotation curve of equation ( [ eq2 ] ) for each sample is overlaid .",
    "the fitting was done using an error - weighted , nonlinear fit of equation ( [ eq2 ] ) with @xmath38 as a fixed value of m60 recession velocity ( @xmath39 km s@xmath3 ) rather than a free parameter for a better fitting . using the biweight location of @xcite , the systemic velocity of the m60 gc system",
    "is estimated to be @xmath40 km s@xmath3 ( see section [ dispersion ] ) , which agrees with the m60 recession velocity ( 1056@xmath41 km s@xmath3 ) and the biweight mean velocity ( 1066@xmath4245 km s@xmath3 ) for 38 gcs given by @xcite within the uncertainty .",
    "we derived the rotation amplitudes , @xmath37 , @xmath43 km s@xmath3 for the entire gcs , @xmath44 km s@xmath3 for the blue gcs , and @xmath45 km s@xmath3 for the red gcs .",
    "thus , the rotation amplitude of the blue gcs is slightly smaller than that of the red gcs , or is consistent with that of the red gcs within the uncertainty .",
    "our results based on 121 gcs are in contrast to the fact that @xcite found no rotation using only 38 gcs . to investigate the cause for difference of the rotation amplitudes between this study and @xcite",
    ", we estimate the rotation amplitude using all 121 gcs by dividing gcs into 54 gcs within the region of @xcite , and 67 gcs outside the region of @xcite . in the result",
    ", the rotation amplitude for the former sample is estimated to be @xmath46 km s@xmath3 , which is much smaller than that for the latter sample ( @xmath47 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "therefore , it is concluded that no rotation found in @xcite is because of a small spatial coverage in their study .",
    "in addition , the orientation of the rotation axis ( @xmath35 ) is estimated to be @xmath48 for the entire gcs , @xmath49 for the blue gcs , and @xmath50 for the red gcs .",
    "the orientations of rotation axes for all subsamples appear to be similar , and they are closer to the photometric minor axis ( @xmath51 , or @xmath52 , @xcite ) than the photometric major axis .",
    "interestingly , the position angle of ngc 4647 relative to m60 is 314@xmath53 from north to east .",
    "this means that the line connecting m60 and ngc 4647 is nearly perpendicular to the rotation axes of the gc system . in figure  [ fig - rotreg ]",
    ", we present the rotation of the gc system for the samples of different radial bins in order to investigate the radial variation of rotational properties .",
    "the top panel shows the gcs in the range of @xmath54 , while the lower two panels show the gcs for the inner region ( @xmath55 , middle panel ) and the outer region ( @xmath56 , bottom panel ) .",
    "the same fitting procedure used for the results in figure  [ fig - rotsub ] was applied for the entire , blue , and red gcs in each radial bin .",
    "the best fit rotation curves for each sample are overlaid as solid ( entire gcs ) , dashed ( blue gcs ) , and dotted ( red gcs ) lines .",
    "it appears that the orientation of rotation axes for all gc subsamples changes slightly from the inner region to the outer region with a large uncertainty .",
    "the change of the rotation axis from the inner region to the outer region for the blue gcs is seen in the cases of m87 @xcite and of m49 @xcite .",
    "the orientation of the rotation axis for the blue gcs in m87 drastically changes from the major axis in the inner region to the minor axis in the outer region .",
    "however , the blue gcs in m49 show the opposite change of rotation axis from the minor axis in the inner region to the major axis in the outer region . due to the limited number of gcs in this study",
    ", it is difficult to make a solid conclusion on the radial change of the rotation axis for the m60 gc system .",
    "a larger sample of gcs is needed for further study on the change of the rotation axis as a function of the radius .",
    "we summarize the kinematics of the m60 gc system derived in this study in table  [ tab - m60kin ] .",
    "several kinematic parameters for the entire , blue , and red gcs are presented for the entire region ( @xmath54 ) , the inner region ( @xmath57 ) , and the outer region ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the column ( 1 ) defines the range of the projected radial distance from the center of m60 for each region in arcsec , and the column ( 2 ) gives the median value of the radial distance in arcsec .",
    "the number of gcs in each region is shown in the column ( 3 ) . the column ( 4 ) and",
    "( 5 ) represent the mean line - of - sight velocity ( the biweight location of @xcite ) and the velocity dispersion about this mean velocity ( the biweight scale of @xcite ) , respectively .",

    "the column ( 8) gives the velocity dispersion about the best fit rotation curve .",
    "the column ( 9 ) gives the absolute value of the ratio of the rotation amplitude to the velocity dispersion about the best fit rotation curve .",
    "the uncertainties of these values represent @xmath58 @xmath59 confidence intervals that are determined from the numerical bootstrap procedure following the method of @xcite .",
    "the estimated velocity dispersion for entire 121 gcs ( @xmath60 km s@xmath3 ) agrees with the value ( @xmath61 km s@xmath3 ) of @xcite based on 38 gcs within the uncertainty . in addition , it is found that the velocity dispersion about the mean velocity of the gc system for the red gcs ( @xmath62 km s@xmath3 ) is marginally larger than that for the blue gcs ( @xmath63 km s@xmath3 ) , which confirms the result of @xcite with improved statistics .",
    "interestingly , the velocity dispersion about the best fit rotation curve for the red gcs ( @xmath64 km s@xmath3 ) is also marginally larger than that for the blue gcs ( @xmath65 km s@xmath3 ) .    in figure  [ fig - vel ] , we plot the radial velocities of gcs with measured uncertainties against projected galactocentric distances .",
    "the mean radial velocities in two radial bins are overlaid by squares with long horizontal errorbar .",
    "the velocity dispersion about the mean velocity in each bin is also represented by a vertical errorbar .",
    "the mean velocities of all samples agree well with the systemic velocity of m60 .",
    "both of the velocity dispersions about the mean velocity and about the best fit rotation curve in the inner region are marginally larger than or comparable to those in the outer region for all three samples ( see table  [ tab - m60kin ] ) .    to investigate the radial variation of velocity dispersion in detail , we present a smoothed radial profile of velocity dispersions about the mean radial velocity ( filled symbols ) and about the best fit rotation curve ( open symbols ) in figure  [ fig - disp ] . we calculate the velocity dispersion of the gcs lying within a bin with fixed radial width , @xmath66 kpc as increasing the bin center by a fixed step width , @xmath67 kpc .",
    "we define the radial width and the step width so that the number of gcs per bin exceeds 10 , and the calculation stops when the number of gcs in a bin is less than 10 .",
    "the velocity dispersions about the mean radial velocity of the entire and blue gcs are nearly constant for the range of radius .",
    "however , velocity dispersions of the red gcs are decreasing in the inner region ( @xmath68 kpc ) and are increasing in the outer region ( @xmath69 kpc ) although the variation is not large .",
    "the velocity dispersions about the best fit rotation curves of all three samples are not different from those about the mean radial velocities .",
    "if we assume the spherical symmetry of the m60 gc system , we can apply the jeans equation in the absence of rotation to the dynamical analysis of the gc system .",
    "the spherical jeans equation is    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is a three dimensional radial distance from the galactic center , @xmath72 is a three dimensional density profile of the gc system , @xmath73 is a radial component of velocity dispersion , @xmath74 is a velocity anisotropy , @xmath75 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath76 is a total gravitating mass contained within a sphere of radius @xmath71 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath77 is a tangential component of velocity dispersion that is equal to an azimuthal component of the velocity dispersion , @xmath78 , in a spherical case .",
    "several studies on the dynamics of the gc system have focused on determining the gravitational mass , @xmath76 , using the jeans equation by assuming a simple isotropic orbit with @xmath79 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , with an aid of an independent determination of the mass profile of an elliptical galaxy using x - ray data ( e.g. , @xcite for m60 ) , the velocity anisotropy itself can be investigated ( e.g. , @xcite ) . following the analysis of the m87 gc system by @xcite and the m49 gc system by @xcite",

    "calculated from the jeans equation using those inputs with the measured vdp @xmath80 , we determine the velocity anisotropy of the m60 gc system .",
    "we used the surface number density profiles of m60 gcs in @xcite .",

    "then they subtracted these background values from the original number counts to produce the radial profiles of the net surface number density of gcs .",

    "[ dark ] , we find that most x - ray mass profiles deviate significantly from the stellar mass profiles in the inner region at @xmath141 kpc , indicating that x - ray mass profiles are not reliable at the very small radius because of angular resolution limit and non - equilibrium energetics . in the intermediate region at @xmath142 kpc , the x - ray mass profiles derived using two component fit of the gas number density ( lower panel ) agree to the stellar mass profiles , while those derived using one component fit of the gas number density ( upper panel ) do not . in the outer region at @xmath143 kpc , all x - ray mass profiles are larger than the stellar mass profiles , confirming the need of an extended dark matter halo as shown in  [ dark ] . since the discrepancy between x - ray and stellar mass profiles is significant only in the inner region at @xmath141 kpc , where there are no gcs , and x - ray mass profiles that account for the dark matter halo are similar to or larger than the stellar mass profile at @xmath144 kpc , we conclude that the x - ray mass profiles are good enough to determine the velocity anisotropy of the m60 gc system for the following analysis .",

    "the kinematic properties of the gc system in m60 compared to those in other ges are useful to test the kinematic predictions of formation models of the gcs in ge .",
    "a summary of several model descriptions and predictions can be found in several literature @xcite .",
    "classical formation models can be divided into four broad categories : the monolithic collapse model , the major merger model , the multiphase dissipational collapse model , and the dissipationless accretion model .",
    "the monolithic collapse model describes that an elliptical galaxy and its gcs are formed through the collapse of an isolated massive gas cloud or protogalaxy at high redshift @xcite . in this model",
    ", the color distribution of gcs shows a smooth shape with a single peak , and the rotation of gcs can be generated by tidal torques from companions @xcite .",
    "although this model can explain some observational properties of elliptical galaxies successfully ( see @xcite ) , the bimodal color distribution of the gc system in many ges ( e.g. , @xcite ) make it hard to accept this model .",
    "in addition , the strong rotation of the gc system as seen in m60 and m87 is not expected from the collapse of a single , isolated protogalactic cloud . moreover ,",
    "several gc systems in ges show a globally isotropic velocity ellipsoid that needs some kinds of relaxation processes that the monolithic collapse model can not account for .",
    "the major merger model suggests that elliptical galaxies are formed by a merger of two or more disk galaxies @xcite . in this model ,",
    "younger , spatially concentrated , red gcs are formed during the merger , while spatially extended , blue gcs come from the halos of the disk galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as a result , the color distribution of gcs is expected to be bimodal .",
    "this model predicts that the newly formed red gcs show little rotation compared to the blue gcs since the angular momentum would be transported to the outer region during the merging process . this model has received particular attention since it could explain several photometric properties of the gc system in ges and little rotation of the red gc system in m49 @xcite .",
    "however , contrary to the case of m49 , the red gc system in m60 , m87 , ngc 5128 , and ngc 4636 show a strong or modest rotation . from the simulation of dissipationless major mergers of spiral galaxies , @xcite found that both pre - existing metal - poor clusters ( mpcs ) and metal - rich clusters ( mrcs ) obtain significant amounts of rotation beyond @xmath2 10 kpc , regardless of the orbital configuration of the merging galaxies .",
    "however , both the blue and red gc systems in ngc 1399 show weak rotation , which is not consistent with the result of @xcite . therefore , it is needed to explain what makes the complex rotational properties of the gc systems in ges . in the dissipationless major merger model , most gcs",
    "are formed before a last major merger event .",
    "there are several observational results based on the spectroscopy of the gcs in ges consistent with this : the blue gcs and red gcs show a small age difference and are both old : m60 @xcite , m87 @xcite , m49 @xcite , and ngc 1399 @xcite .",
    "then , what we observe today is the gc system that was affected by the orbital mixing caused by the last major merger event , and the observed kinematics can not reflect the circumstance when the gc system was formed .",
    "therefore , it is noted that it is difficult to trace the orbital history of the gc system from the observed kinematics @xcite , and to test the validity of the dissipationless merger scenario .",
    "@xcite proposed the multiphase dissipational collapse model that ellipticals form their gcs in distinct star formation phases through a dissipational collapse .",
    "in addition , there is a capture of additional gcs by tidal effects from neighboring galaxies or the accretion of dwarf galaxies . since the blue gcs",
    "are formed in the first star formation phase and the red gcs are formed in the subsequent star formation phase after the gas in the galaxy is self - enriched , the color distribution of gcs is expected to be bimodal .",
    "this model predicts that the blue gc system shows no rotation and a high velocity dispersion , while the red gc system shows some rotation depending on the degree of dissipation in the collapse . as the galactocentric distance increases up to 90 , the stellar velocity dispersion in m60 approaches to the value of 200 km s@xmath3 @xcite that is comparable to or smaller than the velocity dispersion of the blue gcs .",
    "this might support this model , as @xcite pointed out in the case of ngc 1399 and m87 .",
    "however , this model disagrees with the results that blue gc systems in several ges including m60 in table  [ tab - gesum ] show larger than or comparable rotation amplitude to that of the red gc system .",
    "@xcite proposed the dissipationless accretion model ; the red gcs formed in a dissipational collapse , while the blue gcs were subsequently captured from other galaxies through mergers or tidal stripping .",
    "this model predicts a bimodal color distribution of gcs in ges and a uniform color distribution in dwarf ellipticals .",
    "however , there is an example of low - luminosity elliptical galaxy ( e.g. , ngc 1427 ) that shows a bimodal color distribution @xcite .",
    "since the blue gcs are captured from other galaxies , they are expected to show extended spatial distribution .",
    "@xcite argued that if the scenario of @xcite is correct , then the blue gcs are expected to have radially biased orbits rather than the isotropic or tangentially biased orbits , and are also expected to show no rotation .",
    "although the kinematic data for the outer gcs are not complete to date , current data for the blue gcs in table  [ tab - gesum ] show negligible rotations and no signs of radially biased orbits , which is not consistent with the scenario of @xcite .",
    "since the classical models do not give quantitative predictions concerning the kinematic properties of the gc system , it is instructive to compare the observational results with those in the recent numerical simulations .",
    "although there are some numerical simulations of the gc system focusing on the color distribution @xcite , the spatial distribution @xcite , and the mass - metallicity relation for the blue gcs @xcite , there are few simulation results that can be compared directly with observational results summarized in table @xcite    in a pioneering work , @xcite numerically investigated the kinematics of the gc system in e / s0 galaxies formed from a dissipationless merging of spiral galaxies .",
    "they presented the kinematic properties such as rotation and velocity dispersion of the pre - existing mpcs and mrcs for several merger configurations ( e.g. , pair and multiple mergers ) .",
    "for the rotation , both mpcs and mrcs show larger rotation amplitudes in the outer region ( @xmath167 ) than those in inner region ( @xmath168 ) , regardless of the merger configuration .",
    "interestingly , observational data in figure [ fig - gerot ] show that the rotation amplitudes for the blue gcs do not change as the galactocentric distance increases . however , those for the red gcs increase marginally from the inner region to the outer region if we neglect the point of ngc 4636 ( filled pentagon ) , as expected in the simulation . for the velocity dispersion , the mpcs show slightly larger the central velocity dispersion than the mrcs , indicating that the mpcs are dynamically hotter than the mrcs .",
    "moreover , the vdps for both mpcs and mrcs are decreasing as the galactocentric distance increases in all major merger models , while those are sometimes very flat in multiple merger models .",
    "the kinematic data in figure [ fig - gesigresi ] show that the vdps might be different depending on the galaxy ( e.g. , flat for m49 and increasing for m87 ) , and the difference of vdps between blue and red gcs appears to exist .",
    "although the latter is not expected in the simulation , the former is consistent with the simulation , implying different merger histories depending on the galaxies .",
    "@xcite studied the formation of the gcs in a milky way - size galaxy using a gas dynamics cosmological simulation with an adaptive refinement tree code .",
    "however , they had to stop the simulation at @xmath169 due to the limited computational resources .",
    "later , @xcite , using a separate collisionless @xmath170-body simulation described in @xcite up to @xmath171 , calculated the gc orbits for the similar galactic system .",
    "they found that , at present , the gc orbits are isotropic in the inner 50 kpc region from the galactic center , but radial in the outer region .",
    "although it is difficult to exam the observational data at large distance ( @xmath172 kpc ) because of insufficient gc samples at that region , the isotropic orbit in the inner region is roughly consistent with the kinematic data of ges ( see table [ tab - gesum ] ) .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite modeled a dynamical evolution of the m87 gc system with different initial conditions for the mass function , the spatial distribution , and the velocity anisotropy of the gc system , following the evolution of a model gc system given by @xcite . in their result , for a two - slope power - law initial mass function of the gcs corresponding to the mass function of the old clusters , a flat radial profile for the mean mass of the gcs obtained from the observation can be acquired from the simulation with any velocity anisotropy of the gc system . however , for a power - law initial mass function of the gcs that is regarded as that of the young clusters , the observed flat radial profile for the mean mass of the gcs can be obtained from the simulation only with a strong radial anisotropy of the gc system .",
    "this initial radial anisotropy is much more radially biased than the observed one in the gc systems of ges ( having mostly isotropic velocity ellipsoids as seen in table [ tab - gesum ] ) , raising a problem for a scenario that the young gc system in mergers like the antennae may evolve into the gc system seen in ges .    by viewing the formation of the m60 gc system in the context of kinematic predictions of above models , the strong rotations of the blue and red gc system are consistent with the simulation of @xcite .",
    "however , the larger velocity dispersion of the red gcs compared to the blue gcs in m60 is not consistent with the predictions of several formation models .",
    "m60 might be a particular case among ges due to a possible interaction with the companion galaxy , ngc 4647 . while they were regarded as a non - interacting system ( e.g. , @xcite ) , recent observational results suggest evidences of current interaction between two : ( 1 ) the morphological structure of ngc 4647 is clearly asymmetric @xcite ; ( 2 ) the stellar kinematic study shows that the inner region of m60 has a strong rotational support compared to other ges , and has an asymmetric rotation curve @xcite ; ( 3 ) an x - ray filament that extends to the north - eastern edge of m60 is seen @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) young luminous star clusters or associations in ngc 4647 are found @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found no obvious signs of a recent starburst , interaction or merger by estimating the ages and metallicities from the spectra of m60 gcs .",
    "thus , it appears that the interaction between two started very recently , and did not affect the old m60 gc system significantly .",
    "the spatial coverage of observed gcs in @xcite is not enough to study the interacting region between m60 and ngc 4647 ( see figure [ fig - vmap ] ) .",
    "therefore , to understand the formation of m60 gc system in terms of an interaction between galaxies , it is important to obtain a large spectroscopic sample of gcs at larger galactocentric distance with high s / n ratio enough to determine the age and metallicity .",
    "using the photometric and spectroscopic database of 121 gcs ( 83 blue gcs and 38 red gcs ) in the ge m60 ( ngc 4649 ) in the virgo cluster , we have investigated the kinematics of the gc system of this galaxy .",
    "our primary results are summarized below :    1 .",
    "similar to the case of m87 gcs @xcite , the entire , blue and red gc subsamples of m60 show significant overall rotations .",
    "the rotation axes are nearly perpendicular to the line connecting m60 and its companion ngc 4647 . 2 .   both of the velocity dispersion about the mean velocity and about the best fit rotation curve of the red gcs are marginally larger than those of the blue gcs .",
    "this implies that the red gc system might be dynamically hotter than the blue gc system unlike the gc systems in other ges .",
    "3 .   comparison of observed stellar and gc velocity dispersion profiles with those calculated from the stellar mass profile showed that the mass - to - light ratio is not constant , but should be increased as the galactocentric distance increases , indicating the existence of an extended dark matter halo in m60 .",
    "using the x - ray mass profile , the number density distribution of gcs , and the observed vdp of gcs , we have determined the velocity ellipsoids of the m60 gc system .",
    "the entire gc system in m60 appears to have a tangentially biased velocity ellipsoid unlike the gc systems in other ges .",
    "two subsamples have a different velocity anisotropy : the blue gcs show a modest tangentially biased velocity ellipsoid , while the red gcs show a modest radially biased or an isotropic velocity ellipsoid .",
    "we have compared the kinematics of the m60 gc system in this study with the results of other gc systems in ges . as a whole ,",
    "the rotation - corrected velocity dispersion of the blue gcs is similar to or larger than that of the red gcs unlike the m60 gc system .",

    "the gc systems in ges have common kinematic properties such as velocity dispersion , while the rotation and the velocity anisotropy show diverse results .",
