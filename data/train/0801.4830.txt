    "natural convection forces turbulence in the atmosphere , in the oceans as well as in numerous geophysical , industrial and astrophysical flows .",
    "understanding the convection regimes settling on such large scales is a major scientific challenge , directly impacting our ability to assess heat and mass transfer in the environment , for example .",
    "one of the simplest laboratory paradigm to explore the basic mechanisms of turbulent convection is the rayleigh - bnard cell .",
    "it consists in an horizontal layer of fluid between two isothermal plates imposing a temperature difference @xmath3 destabilizing the fluid .",
    "dimensional analysis shows than the main control parameter in such cells is the rayleigh number ( @xmath1 ) which is proportional to @xmath3 and to the cube of the fluid layer height ( the complete definition of @xmath1 is given later ) .",
    "unfortunately , due to this geometrical dependence , the reachable rayleigh numbers in laboratory experiments are decades smaller than those estimated for environmental flows ( typically @xmath4 in the atmosphere for example ) .",
    "thus , our confidence in extrapolating laboratory findings to such flows depends on the understanding of very high @xmath1 experiments .",
    "since 1997 , a few rayleigh - bnard experiments @xcite reported a significant enhancement of heat transport efficiency across the cell above @xmath5 within boussinesq conditions .",
    "these observations were interpreted as the signature of the `` ultimate regime '' of convection , predicted in 1962 by r. kraichnan @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , this regime is characterized by the turbulent state of the two boundary layers laying close to each plate but the precise conditions for triggering this boundary layer instability are difficult to predict @xcite .",
    "the interpretation presented in 1997 @xcite was motivated by the observation of an unprecedented heat transfer scaling versus @xmath1 , compatible with the onset of kraichnan s regime and significantly more efficient than any other observed or predicted scaling . in another paper ,",
    "the authors of @xcite reported another signature of the transition on the local temperature statistics at mid - height within the cell @xcite . in 2001 , the observation of the asymptotic heat transport scaling of the ultimate regime was reported in a similar cell with a calibrated corrugated surface @xcite . for usual velocity turbulent boundary layers ,",
    "such surfaces are well known to set the viscous sub - layer height constant and thus to reveal the asymptotic transport scaling @xcite .",
    "this experiment therefore supports the 1997 interpretation of the occurrence of the ultimate regime of convection .    but a more direct evidence of a laminar - to - turbulent transition of the boundary layers near @xmath6 is still missing , which motivated the present work .",
    "direct local measurements within the boundary layers are difficult for practical reasons : the thermal boundary layer is very thin ( typically smaller than 100 @xmath7 in the experiments discussed above ) and its temperature profile is ra dependent . to bypass the difficulties of local invasive measurements within the boundary layer",
    ", we use the low frequency fluctuations of the bottom plate to probe the stability of the bottom boundary layer .",
    "more precisely , we apply a constant heating power @xmath8 on the bottom plate and monitor its temperature fluctuations of order one percent of @xmath3 .",
    "we focus on times scales longer than the turn - over time of the mean flow circulation , for which the lack of spatial resolution of the `` plate - probe '' is not a limitation .",
    "we find that above @xmath5 , such fluctuations become significantly larger than those in the bulk of the flow , while both have the same intensity for lower @xmath1 .",
    "besides , the probability density function of the bottom plate temperature becomes increasingly skewed towards negative values above @xmath5 , corresponding to more and more frequent intense cooling events .",
    "we show that both observations are straightforwardly interpretable by the occurrence of an instability in the boundary layer for @xmath5 , which is consistent with the scenario of a transition to the ultimate regime of convection .    for reference ,",
    "we mention that three rayleigh - bnard experiments explored @xmath1 larger than @xmath9 and did nt find any significant enhancement of the heat transfer @xcite . in @xcite , a transition of the local temperature statistics",
    "have been reported for @xmath10 and @xmath9 @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors report an enhancement of heat transport at high @xmath1 but , according to the authors themselves , the data are not fulfilling the boussinesq conditions and therefore are difficult to compare to others . for references on numerical simulations ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the reason for such a scatter between experiments at very high @xmath1 is still not understood and this issue is not addressed in this paper .",
    "we just note that the laminar - turbulent transition of velocity - driven boundary layers is known to be highly sensitive to experimental conditions @xcite and the same could remain true for `` temperature - driven '' boundary layers .",
    "for convenience , we recall here the definitions of the main dimensionless parameters .",
    "the rayleigh number @xmath11 and the prandtl number @xmath12 characterize the buoyancy force and the molecular transport properties where @xmath13 is the gravity acceleration , @xmath3 is temperature difference across the cell of height @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are respectively the isobaric thermal expansion coefficient , the kinematic viscosity and the thermal diffusivity .",
    "the nusselt number @xmath18 characterizes the heat transport efficiency across the cell , where @xmath8 is the mean heat flux ( in practice , the applied joule heating ) , @xmath19 the thermal conductivity of the fluid and @xmath20 the surface of the plate - fluid interface .",

    "the cell is hanging in a cryogenic vacuum : the top plate is cooled by an helium bath at @xmath24 through a calibrated thermal resistance ( @xmath29 at @xmath30 ) .",
    "its temperature is regulated by a pid controller and we apply a constant and distributed joule heating on the bottom plate . the heat leaks from the cell in such set - up ( about @xmath31 at @xmath32 ) are at least 4 decades smaller than this heating and are essentially due to the radiative transfer as shown in @xcite .",

    "these values are a compromise to obtain the best accuracy of helium properties , a 3 decades range of @xmath1 around @xmath43 and a limited range of @xmath44 .",
    "we now show that the temperature of the bottom plate @xmath45 is a well defined and measurable global quantity in such a set - up , accounting for the homogeneous temperature fluctuations of the whole plate .",

    "we find cut - off frequencies at @xmath48 between @xmath49 and @xmath50 which is consistent with the thermistances specifications .",
    "thus thermometry has enough dynamics to reflect the plate s temperature fluctuations up to a few @xmath51 , which is above frequencies of interest .",

    ", we can define a time - dependent temperature drop @xmath113 across the bottom boundary layer , which mean value is @xmath114 and which fulfills ( by definition ) : @xmath115    below @xmath116 , we conjecture that the bottom plate temperature fluctuations follow the ones of the bulk with negligible noise introduced by the temperature drop @xmath113 across the bottom boundary layer , that is : @xmath117    this is supported by the overlapping spectral densities plateaus of @xmath70 and @xmath45 reported on fig .",

    "this is consistent with a spatial filtering by the plate of the fluid s temperature inhomogeneities extending over less than typically one cell diameter .",
    "estimations of the thermal characteristics of the fluid - plate system also corroborate our conjecture .",
    "indeed , the expected time response of the plate to a slow variation of @xmath70 can be estimated as @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the ( measured ) plate s heat capacity and @xmath124 is the bottom boundary layer dynamical thermal resistance @xmath124 : @xmath125    we find that @xmath122 is always more than one decade smaller than @xmath126 . since the heat capacity of the bottom plate is significantly smaller than the heat capacity of the fluid , the plate represents a negligible thermal load for the slow temperature variations of the bulk fluid .",

    "[ plateau ] could be interpreted without resorting to a flow transition occurring near @xmath5 .",
    "a first argument is that both enhancements of nu and @xmath45 fluctuations nearly occur for the same @xmath1 . if we accept that this coincidence is not fortuitous , both events should be accounted by a single mechanism which can not be a simple masking - effect hypothesis .    as a second argument",
    ", the small -if any- dependence of @xmath128 for @xmath129 , seems in contradiction with our knowledge of boundary layers physics in the hard turbulence regime , which preceeds the ultimate one .",
    "this contradiction suggests that the observed high @xmath1 regime is not the hard turbulence one .",
    "indeed , in the hard turbulence regime , the typical length scales of convection , such as the plumes various characteristic sizes , are known to decrease continuously as @xmath1 increases , yielding to an increase of the number of degrees of freedom in a given cell @xcite . in physical systems",
    ", one expects the relative fluctuations of global variables to decrease as the number @xmath130 of degrees of freedom contributing to this variable increases , ] which is not the case of @xmath97 for @xmath129 . to make this argument more concrete , we present below an illustrative model for boundary layer noise in the hard turbulence regime and we show that it leads to a contradiction if we apply it to the high ra region .",
    "our model assumes that @xmath113 fluctuations can be described as resulting from the shot noise of plumes across the boundary layer , where plumes are defined as independent coherent structures erupting from the plates and responsible for all the heat flux transport . by analogy with the electronic shot noise crossing barriers ( for example see @xcite ) , shot noise from plumes of heat content @xmath131 is accounted by a white noise source of heat flux with a power spectral density @xmath132 , which is in parallel with the boundary layer resistance @xmath124 . at the low frequency of interest , the inertia @xmath133 of the plate can be neglected as shown earlier ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "thus we predict a white noise spectrum for @xmath113 with a power spectral density @xmath135 . for consistency",
    ", the plateau extent @xmath136 should be to smaller or equal to the inverse of the autocorrelation time of each plume . since @xmath136 corresponds to 2 turn over times typically ,",
    "this requirement is not stringent . with this model ,",
    "it is possible to infer the number @xmath130 of independent plumes arising from the plate at a given time , which can be seen as the number of degrees of freedom of the boundary layer .",
    "we assume that @xmath131 corresponds to a @xmath137 of the thermal boundary layer heat content @xmath138 with : @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the surface and thickness of the boundary layer in the hard turbulence regime . neglecting the 1.3 prefactor in eq.[resdyn ]",
    ", a bit of algebra gives : @xmath142 where @xmath143 . for @xmath144 , the bulk contribution @xmath97",
    "is reflected so we have @xmath145 and we note that this value is roughly independent of @xmath1 .",
    "then , the above formula indicates that the number of degrees of freedom @xmath130 of the boundary layer scales as @xmath146 , that is a decreasing function of @xmath1 .",
    "this is in contradiction with experience in the hard turbulence regime @xcite , which weakens the initial hypothesis of the existence of `` hard - turbulence '' boundary layers above @xmath116 .    as a final argument",
    ", we note that the strong departure from gaussianity for @xmath147 is not consistent with the continuous increase of the number of degrees of freedom of the boundary layer in the hard turbulence regime .",
    "indeed , such an increase should favor the convegence to a gaussian of the pdf of global quantities such as @xmath145 , which is not the case .",
    "a constant heating is applied to the bottom plate of a rayleigh - bnard cell and this plate s temperature fluctuations are analysed .",
    "we focus on times scales larger than typically 2 turn over times of the large scale circulation .",
    "below @xmath116 , we give evidence that the plate s fluctuations follow the temperature fluctuations of the bulk of the cell .",
    "this implies that the temperature drop across the bottom boundary layer has negligible low frequency fluctuations . above @xmath127 , the bottom plate fluctuation abruptly",
    "increase compared to the fluctuations in the bulk .",
    "this change is interpreted as an extra noise contribution brought in by the boundary layer .",
    "we discussed and discarded the possibility that this noise was present but simply masked at lower @xmath1 .",
    "the negative skewness of the plate s temperature -which absolute value quickly increases in the high @xmath1 regime- supports the picture of a boundary layer becoming unstable for @xmath5    the transition of the heat transfer law has already been reported with this cell @xcite .",
    "these authors interpreted this as the triggering of kraichnan s ultimate regime of convection , which is associated with a laminar to turbulent transition of the boundary layer @xcite .",
