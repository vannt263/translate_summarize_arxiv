    "orion bn / kl is the closest region of high - mass star formation ( @xmath10pc ) and though also the archetype , it is not necessarily well understood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , the sources that drive extensive outflow activity in bn / kl ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and contribute most to its luminosity have not been identified with certainty ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is true because bn / kl is crowded , exhibiting @xmath11 compact infrared ( ir ) peaks distributed over @xmath12 and because extinction is high and variable across the region @xcite . as high - mass stars often form in clusters ( * ?",
    "* and references therein ) , there are presumably numerous embedded protostars and young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the region , many of which have probably not been recognized yet .",
    "two notable sources in bn / kl exhibit centimeter - wave continuum and as a result are believed to be luminous ysos , ir source_n _ @xcite and radio source_i _ @xcite .",
    "source_n _ , also known as radio source_l _ @xcite , exhibits a bipolar radio jet @xcite , hard x - ray emission @xcite , and @xmath13 m co overtone emission probably from the hot surface of an accretion disk @xcite .",
    "source_i _ has been difficult to study because it has not been detected at ir wavelengths , probably due to high extinction .",
    "it lies close to the mid - ir source irc2 @xcite for which @xmath14 @xcite and the peak of the orion hot core , for which probably @xmath15 @xcite",
    ". however , source_i _ excites h@xmath16o and sio maser emission in dense , hot material at radii @xmath17au @xcite , which may be used to study gas dynamics in detail ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have imaged bn / kl in the mid - ir at resolutions of @xmath0-@xmath1 with the intention to characterize sources of excitation .",
    "this is the first multiwavelength study with sub - arcsecond resolution up to @xmath3 m .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we concentrate on a largely qualitative interpretation of the data .",
    "quantitative modeling and analysis of the whole region will be discussed in a separate paper .",
    "we observed the bn / kl region with the keck - i telescope on 1999 december 21 , 2000 october 14 , and 2002 august 20 .",
    "we used the long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ; jones & puetter 1993 ) in imaging mode at seven filter wavelengths from @xmath2 m to @xmath18 m ( table1 ) to obtain frames of 128@xmath19128 pixels ( @xmath20 ) , with which we created mosaics .",
    "we chopped at 5hz and nodded the telescope both using fields @xmath21 west in 1999 and 2002 and @xmath22 north in 2000 .",
    "registration of overlapping frames is uncertain to @xmath23 pixel . to register images obtained at different wavelengths",
    ", we used the peak of the becklin - neugebauer object ( bn ) as a reference .",
    "when bn lay outside a mosaic , we used irc7 .",
    "the formal uncertainty in registration is @xmath24 pixel .",
    "we used observing procedures and data reduction techniques discussed by @xcite and implemented in the mosaic image processing package @xcite .",
    "observations of @xmath25 cma demonstrated the high quality of the point source responses .",
    "images at @xmath26 m and longer wavelengths are diffraction limited ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) , while seeing , chopping / nodding error , and smoothing during processing limit resolution to @xmath27 for shorter wavelengths .",
    "to calibrate flux densities , we scaled images at each wavelength to match the intensities for bn or irc7 reported by @xcite , interpolated to the lws passbands ( table1 ) .",
    "we calibrated the pixel scale to first order using observations in 1999 of the binary xyper for which we adopted a @xmath28 separation and @xmath29 position angle @xcite .",
    "we made second order adjustments to align the ir and radio centroids of bn and source_n _ on a @xmath30 m mosaic , where we defined the radio centroid for source_n _ as the midpoint between the lobes .",
    "the adopted scale and rotation were @xmath31 pixel@xmath32 and @xmath33 clockwise ( i.e. , north is rotated counterclockwise from vertical on the images ) .",
    "uncertainties of 1 - 2% and @xmath34 include the @xmath35yr@xmath32 proper motion for bn @xcite .",
    "we rechecked the plate scale in 2002 with observations of @xmath25her , for which we adopted a @xmath36 separation and @xmath37 position angle @xcite , and obtained @xmath38 pixel@xmath32 and @xmath39 clockwise , with uncertainties of 2% and @xmath40 , in good agreement with earlier results .",
    "we adopted the 1999 plate scale for images obtained in 2000 because a parallelogram distortion precluded our estimating a new solution .",
    "however , because the sub - fields shown here are small ( containing just irc2 and irc7 ) the resulting errors are @xmath41 pixels .",
    "we estimated this error empirically by registering the peak of irc7 observed at @xmath30 m in 2000 and 1999 , applying the registration offsets to images from 2000 for other wavelengths , and measuring the misalignment in the peaks of irc2 .    to register the radio position of source_i",
    "_ on the ir images , we assumed the radio and ir centroids for bn were coincident and used the angular separation of bn and source_i _ estimated by @xcite . for images obtained in 2000",
    ", we measured angular offsets from ( closeby ) irc7 to minimize the effect of the parallelogram distrotion .",
    "the total uncertainty in radio - ir registration is 1 - 2 pixels .",
    "( we note that the proper motion of bn contributes only a @xmath42 pixel error to the registration . )",
    "we have found that emission from source_n _ at @xmath43 m and @xmath44 m is elongated nearly east - west ( figure1 ) and orthogonal to the bipolar radio structure detected previously by @xcite .",
    "in contrast , other sources in the @xmath43 m and @xmath44 m images are not elongated ( e.g. , irc7 ) .",
    "we propose that the elongation arises from warm dust in the accretion disk inferred previously from the presence of co overtone emission at @xmath45 m @xcite .",
    "we fit a single component elliptical gaussian model to each image . at @xmath43 m , the source size ( half power full width)is @xmath46 , and at @xmath44 m",
    ", the size is @xmath47 ( @xmath48au ) .",
    "the position angles are @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively , while the position angle of the bipolar radio structure is @xmath51 .",
    "the shape of source_n _ at longer wavelengths is more uncertain , because of plateau emission between irc4 and irc7 .",
    "however , if we assume the disk emits as a blackbody peaking close to the shortest wavelength at which it is detected ( @xmath52 m ) , then the characteristic temperature is on the order of 300k .",
    "although source_n _ is extended at mid - ir wavelengths , it is point - like in high angular resolution observations from @xmath53 m to @xmath54 m @xcite .",
    "this near - ir emission may arise from the inner edge of the accretion disk , close to where dust is sublimated .",
    "for the disks of herbig aebe stars that are resolved with interferometry , this inner radius is @xmath55au @xcite . at the distance of bn / kl ,",
    "the near - ir emission would subtend @xmath56 , thus explaining its point - like appearance in observations so far .",
    "the luminosity of source_n _ is not known .",
    "however , mid - ir emission from an accretion disk may be expected to arise from surface material heated by stellar radiation , and we can use the characteristic radius , r , and temperature , t , to estimate the luminosity of source_n _ , @xmath57 .",
    "dust near the surface of the disk is optically thick to stellar radiation ( mostly optical and ultraviolet ) but optically thin to re - emission ( mostly mid - ir ) . for thermal equilibrium , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are grain emissivities for emission and absorption , and",
    "@xmath61 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . for absorption of stellar radiation , @xmath62 , while for re - emission , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a characteristic grain size . for @xmath65 m and @xmath66 m",
    "( typical for interstellar dust ) , @xmath67 and @xmath68l@xmath4 ( mid b - type ) .",
    "this luminosity is consistent with the observation that at @xmath69 m source_n _ is @xmath70 times dimmer than bn ( 1 - 2@xmath71l@xmath4 ; scoville1983 ) , given that source_n _ is 1.2  magnitudes less red between @xmath72 m and @xmath73 m @xcite , if we assume the two stars have approximately the same intrinsic near - ir color .",
    "nonetheless , the estimated luminosity should be regarded with caution .",
    "it depends on uncertain values for @xmath64 and @xmath74 rather than radiative transfer modeling of the spectral energy distribution , and the estimated luminosity exceeds the apparent luminosity of @xmath75l@xmath4 ( table1 ) .",
    "moreoever , identification of source_n _ as a hard x - ray source is a concern since a b - type star is unlikely to be active , though the x - rays may be associated with a less massive companion or the jet .",
    "an ir counterpart to radio source_i _ is long soughtafter .",
    "the lws observations are the first to resolve the angular separation between source_i _ and the comparatively bright irc2 at wavelengths up to @xmath3 m .",
    "nonetheless , we do not detect emission from a counterpart with an upper limit on the order of 1jy at @xmath76 m and 10jy at @xmath77 m .",
    "we suggest that emission from source_i _ is blocked by the orion hot core .",
    "@xcite estimate the average optical depth of the core is @xmath78 at @xmath79 mm .",
    "the wavelength scaling of opacity to shorter wavelengths is uncertain because it depends on grain composition and the amount of processing .",
    "however , if we assume spherical silicate dust grains @xcite , then the optical depth is @xmath80 at @xmath43 m and @xmath81 m .",
    "this is sufficient to obscure the mid - ir dust emission from a @xmath82k blackbody of diameter up to 80au and luminosity up to @xmath83l@xmath4 , which is comparable to the luminosity of the bn / kl region @xcite .",
    "it is also sufficiently large to explain nondetection at @xmath53 m in hubble space telecope ( hst ) and keck observations @xcite .",
    "irc7 is relatively compact and prominent at all observed wavelengths longer than @xmath84 m ( figures2 and 3 ) .",
    "this is probably indicative of star formation at a relatively early phase .",
    "irc7 also lies close ( in projection ) to the radio axis of source_n _",
    "@xcite , and hst observations at @xmath53 m have detected a fan of emission opening away from source_n _ with a bright point at the vertex .",
    "this morphology and orientation may signify interaction with radiation and outflow incident from source_n_. alternatively the near - ir fan may be a scatting cone along the rotation axis of a protostellar system embedded in an optically thin envelope or halo .",
    "irc2 is shaped like a @xmath5au long arc that opens to the southwest , in the direction of source_i _ , which lies close to one end ( figure2 ) .",
    "the locations of knots along the arc depend on wavelength and are distributed @xmath85 to @xmath86 from source_i_. similar emission distributions at @xmath87 and @xmath26 m are reported by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "emission at the shorter wavelengths is the closest to source_i _ while emission at @xmath88 m is among the farthest ( figure3 ) .",
    "although suggestive of central heating , emission at wavelengths near the peaks of the silicate absorption features at @xmath89 m and @xmath90 m also tends to lie away from source_i _",
    "( figures2 and 3 ) .",
    "if local extinction toward source_i _ is enhanced , then it is surprising that the short wavelength emission arises closeby to source_i_. at the same time , we note that the shortest wavelength emission yet detected from irc2 , at @xmath53 m , is associated with the knot `` b '' @xcite , @xmath91 from source_i _ @xcite .",
    "the relationship of irc2 to source_i _ is ambiguous .",
    "because massive stars form in clusters , we speculate that the @xmath92 knots in irc2 may be individual sites of star formation , which together with source_i _ form at least part of a high density core within the larger ( @xmath12 ) bn / kl star forming cluster . in support of this",
    "we note that ( 1 ) the relative distributions of emission in irc2 from @xmath53 m to @xmath88 m do not exhibit an overall systematic pattern ( e.g. , central heating ) , and ( 2 ) knot `` c '' @xcite is both closely associated with a cluster of oh masers ( figure2 ) and x - ray emission ( e. feigelson , private communication ) .",
    "( if the x - ray emission is the result of a wind driven by source_i _",
    ", then other knots would probably be x - ray sources as well . )",
    "the inferred characteristic density of @xmath6-@xmath7pc@xmath8 over @xmath5au is unusually large and greatly exceeds the density of the closeby trapezium @xcite . because high cluster densities are associated with high stellar masses ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) we might expect to observe precursors to o - type stars , but the large density may be due to cluster youth .",
    "as clusters evolve they expand because of stellar dynamics and the expulsion of gas ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "clusters that are still deeply embedded may be expected to exhibit unusually high central densities though observational evidence is weak .",
    "we can not yet exclude the possibility that irc2 is heated externally , by source_i_. the tip of irc2 recedes systematically as wavelength increases from @xmath54 m to @xmath88 m ( figure2 ) , which is suggestive of a local temperature gradient . in principle , irc2 could mark the edge of a wind - blown cavity . relying on maps of sio masers",
    "@xcite propose that source_i _ drives a conical outflow to the north and west , which irc2 just happens to subtend .",
    "@xcite present an alternative model in which source_i _ binds an edge - on flared disk whose limbs extend north and west from the star . in this case",
    "irc2 straddles the disk plane .",
    "the mid - ir arc would comprise irradiated disk surface material and peripheral low latitude material heated by other ysos .",
    "we have detected the probable signature of an accretion disk around source_n _ at mid - ir wavelengths , and we estimate the stellar luminosity is @xmath93l@xmath4 .",
    "we have not identified any counterpart to radio source_i _ , despite higher angular resolution and broader wavelength coverage than previous studies .",
    "we resolve irc2 into knots at up to @xmath88 m and propose that they are sites of star formation .",
    "together , source_i _ and irc2 may mark the dense core ( @xmath6-@xmath7m@xmath4pc@xmath8 ) of the larger bn / kl infrared cluster .",
    "many past studies have sought to demonstrate that luminosity and outflow associated with bn / kl are driven by one or two sources .",
    "this seems increasingly unlikely .",
    "we note that source_n _ has only a modest luminosity and its jet axis is poorly aligned with outflow axes observed on scales of @xmath94au ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , members of the putative irc2-source_i _ subcluster are ready candidates to drive outflow collectively . in a later paper",
