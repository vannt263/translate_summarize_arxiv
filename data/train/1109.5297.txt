    "the deduction of the heat equation or the fourier law for the macroscopic evolution of the energy through a diffusive space - time scaling limit from a microscopic dynamics given by hamilton or schrdinger equations , is one of the most important problem in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics ( @xcite ) .",
    "one dimensional chains of oscillators have been used as simple models for this study . in the context of the classical ( hamiltonian ) dynamics , it is clear that non - linear interactions are crucial for the diffusive behavior of the energy .",
    "in fact , in a chain of harmonic oscillators the energy evolution is ballistic ( @xcite ) . in this linear system ,",
    "the energy of each mode of vibration is conserved .",
    "non - linearities introduce interactions between different modes and destroy these conservation laws and give a certain ergodicity to the microscopic dynamics .    in order to describe the mathematical problem , let us introduce some notation we will use in the rest of the paper . we study a system of anharmonic oscillators , each is denoted by an integer @xmath0 .",
    "we denote by @xmath1 the corresponding position and momentum ( we set the mass equal to 1 ) .",
    "each pair of consecutive particles @xmath2 are connected by a spring which can be anharmonic .",
    "the interaction is described by a potential energy @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that @xmath4 is a nonnegative smooth function satisfying @xmath5 for all @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the equilibrium inter - particle distance , where @xmath4 attains its minimum that we assume to be @xmath8 .",
    "it is convenient to work with inter - particle distances as coordinates , rather than absolute particle positions , so we define @xmath9 .",
    "we denote the translated function @xmath10 by @xmath11 hereafter .",
    "namely , we assume @xmath12 .",
    "the configuration of the system is given by @xmath13 , and energy function ( hamiltonian ) defined for each configuration is formally given by @xmath14 the choice of @xmath15 as the energy of each oscillator is a bit arbitrary , because we associate the potential energy of the bond @xmath16 to the particle @xmath17 .",
    "different choices can be made , but this one is notationally convenient .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian dynamics is given by the equations of motion : @xmath18 we are interested in the macroscopic evolution of the empirical energy profile under a diffusive macroscopic space - time scaling .",
    "more precisely the limit , as @xmath19 , of the energy distribution on @xmath20 defined by @xmath21 energy is not the only conserved quantity under the dynamics .",
    "formally length and momentum are also integral of the motion .",
    "in one dimensional system , even for anharmonic interaction , generically we expect a superdiffusion of the energy , essentially because of the momentum conservation ( @xcite ) . adding a pinning potential @xmath22 on each particle",
    ", it will break the translation invariance of the system and the momentum conservation , and we expect a diffusive behavior for the energy , i.e. the energy profile defined by would converge to the solution @xmath23 of a heat equation @xmath24 under specific conditions on the initial configuration .",
    "the diffusivity @xmath25 is defined by the green - kubo formula associated to the corresponding infinite dynamics in equilibrium at average energy @xmath26 ( see below for the definition ) .",
    "as the deterministic problem is out of reach mathematically , it has been proposed an approach that models the chaotic effects of the non - linearities by stochastic perturbations of the dynamics that conserves energy . in the harmonic case ,",
    "random exchanges of momentum of nearest neighbor particles that conserve total energy but not momentum have been studied ( @xcite ) .",
    "stochastic exchanges that also conserve total momentum have been considered in @xcite , where a divergence of the diffusivity is proven for unpinned harmonic chains .",
    "the stochastic perturbations considered in these papers are very degenerate ( of hypoelliptic type ) , since they act only on the momenta of the particles , and not on the positions .",
    "in particular these stochastic dynamics conserve also the total length @xmath27 .    in this article",
    "we want to deal with anharmonic chains with noise that conserves only energy . for reasons we will explain in a moment , we need more elliptic stochastic perturbations that act also on the positions . in the case of one - dimensional unpinned chains",
    ", there is a way to define these perturbations locally ( see the next section for details ) just using squares of vector fields that appear in the liouville vector field that generates the hamiltonian dynamics . with these perturbations",
    ", we have a dynamics that conserves _ only _ the total energy . as a result ,",
    "the dynamics has a one - parameter family of invariant measures given by the grand canonical measures @xmath28 defined by @xmath29 notice that @xmath30 are independently distributed under these probability measures .",
    "so we can consider the system starting with the equilibrium distribution @xmath31 at temperature @xmath32 .",
    "we can prove the diffusive scaling limit by the results in this article in the following linearized sense : define the space time energy covariance in equilibrium at temperature @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the expectation for the stochastic dynamics starting with the grand - canonical measure at temperature @xmath33 and @xmath36 is the expectation value of @xmath37 under @xmath31 . in the following",
    "we will denote simply by @xmath38 the corresponding value .",
    "clearly @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the variance of @xmath37 under @xmath41",

    "@xmath46 which is formally given by @xmath47    we actually prove a stronger result at the level of fluctuation fields . if the system is in equilibrium at temperature @xmath33 , then standard central limit theorem for independent variables tells us that as @xmath19 energy has gaussian fluctuations , i.e. the energy fluctuation field @xmath48 converges in law to a delta correlated centered gaussian field @xmath49 @xmath50 = \\chi_\\beta \\int     f(y ) g(y ) dy.\\ ] ] in this article we prove that these _ macroscopic _ energy fluctuations evolve diffusively in time ( after a diffusive space - time scaling ) , i.e. that the time dependent distribution @xmath51 converges in law to the solution of the linear spde @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the standard normalized space - time white noise . in this sense , in equilibrium , energy fluctuation evolves macroscopically following the linearized heat equation .",
    "the main point in the proof of this result is the following .",
    "since total energy is conserved , locally the energy of each particle is changed by the energy currents with its neighbors , i.e. applying the generator @xmath54 of the process to the energy @xmath55 we obtain @xmath56 where @xmath57 . here",
    "@xmath58 is the instantaneous energy current associated to the hamiltonian mechanism , while @xmath59 is the instantaneous energy current due to the stochastic part of the dynamics .",
    "while provides automatically one space derivative already at the microscopic level , @xmath60 is not a space - gradient . in this sense",
    "this model falls in the class of the _ non - gradient models_. some of these non - gradient models have been studied with a method introduced by varadhan @xcite .",
    "the main point of this method is to prove that @xmath60 can be approximated by a fluctuation - dissipation decomposition @xmath61 for a properly chosen sequence of local functions @xmath45 . in the harmonic case of our model , this decomposition is exact for every configuration , i.e. there exists a local second order polynomial @xmath45 such that @xmath62 for a constant @xmath63 ( cf .",
    "remark [ rmk - harmonic ] that contains an equivalent decomposition ) . in the anharmonic case ,",
    "such decomposition can be only approximated by a sequence of local functions @xmath64 in the sense that the difference has a small space - time variance with respect to the dynamics in equilibrium at given temperature ( consequently @xmath63 is a function of this temperature ) .    in order to do such decomposition",
    ", we have to use varadhan s approach to non - gradient systems @xcite and the generalization to non - reversible dynamics @xcite .",
    "the main ingredients of the methods are a _",
    "spectral gap _ for the stochastic part of the dynamics , and a _ sector condition _ for the generator @xmath54 of the dynamics .",
    "it is in order to prove these properties that we need such elliptic noise acting also on the positions .",
    "we have to limit ourselves to these results on the equilibrium fluctuation and we are not able to prove the full non - linear equation starting from a global non - stationary profile . unfortunately most of known techniques to prove such hydrodynamic limits in diffusive scaling are based on relative entropy techniques ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) that do not work for the energy diffusion in this model .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we introduce our model and state main results . in section [ sec - strategy ] , we give the strategy for proving the convergence of the finite dimensional distributions . the complete proof is divided into several sections [ sec : space - time - variance - bounds ] , [ sec - hilbert ] , [ sec - bgp ] , [ sec : closedformch2 ] and [ sec : lie - algebra ] , with sector condition proved in section [ sec - sec ] , and the spectral gap in section [ sec : spectral - gap - bound ] .",
