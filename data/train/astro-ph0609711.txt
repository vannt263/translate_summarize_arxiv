    "muon track reconstruction algorithms and background rejection have been described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "compared to @xcite the analysis of the 4-year sample ( 1038 days live time ) was optimized for higher signal passing rate , and accepting a slightly higher contamination of 15 - 20% fake events @xcite .",

    "the search for wimps with the baikal neutrino telescope is based on a possible signal of nearly vertically upward going muons , exceeding the flux of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the method of event selection relies on the application of a series of cuts which are tailored to the response of the telescope to nearly vertically upward moving muons @xcite .",
    "the applied cuts select muons with -1@xmath1 - 0.75 and result in a detection area of about 1800 m@xmath2 for vertically upward going muons .",
