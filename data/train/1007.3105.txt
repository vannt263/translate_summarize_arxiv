    "in wireless ad hoc networks , each node may serve as the data source , destination , or relay at different time instants , which leads to a self - organized network .",
    "such a decentralized structure makes the traditional network analysis methodology used in centralized wireless networks inadequate .",
    "in addition , it is hard to define and quantify the capacity of large wireless ad hoc networks . in the seminal work @xcite , gupta and kumar proved that the transport capacity for wireless ad hoc networks , defined as the bit - meters pumped every second over a unit area , scales as @xmath1 in an arbitrary network , where @xmath2 is node density . in @xcite ,",
    "weber _ et al .",
    "_ derived the upper and lower bounds on the transmission capacity of spread - spectrum wireless ad hoc networks , where the transmission capacity is defined as the product between the maximum density of successful transmissions and the corresponding data rate , under a constraint on the outage probability .",
    "however , the above work only considered single - hop transmissions .    in @xcite , with multi - hop transmissions and assuming all the transmissions are over the same transmission range , sousa and silvester derived the optimum transmission range to maximize a capacity metric , called the expected forward progress .",
    "zorzi and pupolin extended sousa and silvester s work in @xcite to consider rayleigh fading and shadowing .",
    "recently , baccelli _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a spatial - reuse based multi - hop routing protocol . in their protocol , at each hop , the transmitter selects the best relay so as to maximize the effective distance towards the destination and thus to maximize the spatial density of progress . by assuming each transmitter has a sufficient backlog of packets , weber _ et al .",
    "_ in @xcite proposed longest - edge based routing where each transmitter selects a relay that makes the transmission edge longest . in @xcite , andrews _",
    "defined the random access transport capacity . by assuming that all hops bear the same distance with deterministically placed relays , they derived the optimum number of hops and an upper bound on the random access transport capacity .",
    "most of the above works with multi - hop transmissions ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) assume that each hop traverses the same distance , which is not practical when nodes are randomly distributed . on the other hand , in @xcite and @xcite the authors proposed routing protocols with randomly distributed relays ; but they did not address how to optimize the transmission distance at each hop . in this paper , by jointly considering the randomly distributed relays and the optimization for the hop distance , we propose a selection region based multi - hop routing protocol , where the selection region is defined by two parameters : a selection angle and a reference distance . by maximizing the expected density of progress , we derive the upper bound on the optimum reference distance and the relationship between the optimum reference distance and the optimum selection angle .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model and the routing protocol are described in section ii .",
    "the selection region optimization is presented in section iii .",
    "numerical results and discussions are given in section iv .",
    "the computational complexity is analyzed in section v. finally , section vi summarizes our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we first define the network model , then present the selection region based routing protocol .",
    "assume nodes in the network follow a homogenous poisson point process ( ppp ) with density @xmath3 , with slotted aloha being deployed as the medium access control ( mac ) protocol .",
    "we also consider the nodes are mobile , to eliminate the spatial correlation , which is also discussed in @xcite . during each time slot",
    "a node chooses to transmit data with probability @xmath4 , and to receive data with probability @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , at a certain time instant , transmitters in the network follow a homogeneous ppp ( @xmath6 ) with density @xmath7 , while receivers follow another homogenous ppp ( @xmath8 ) with density @xmath9 . considering multi - hop transmissions , at each hop a transmitter tries to find a receiver in @xmath8 as the relay .",
    "we assume that all transmitters use the same transmission power @xmath10 and the wireless channel combines the large - scale path - loss and small - scale rayleigh fading .",
    "the normalized channel power gain over distance @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the small - scale fading , drawn from an exponential distribution of mean @xmath14 with probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the path - loss exponent .    for the transmission from transmitter @xmath17 to receiver @xmath18 ,",
    "it is successful if the received signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) at receiver @xmath18 is above a threshold @xmath19 .",
    "thus the successful transmission probability over this hop with distance @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the sum interference from the simultaneous concurrent transmissions , @xmath25 is the distance from interferer @xmath26 to receiver @xmath18 , and @xmath27 is the average power of ambient thermal noise . in the sequel we approximate @xmath28 , which is reasonable in interference - limited ad hoc networks . from @xcite , the successful transmission probability from transmitter @xmath17 to receiver @xmath18",
    "is derived as @xmath29 where @xmath30      considering a typical multi - hop transmission scenario , where a data source ( s ) sends information to its final destination ( d ) that is located far away , and it is impossible to complete this operation over a single hop . since we assume that nodes are randomly distributed , relays may not be located at an optimum transmission distance as derived in @xcite . to guarantee a relay existing at a proper position",
    ", we propose a selection region based multi - hop routing protocol .",
    "for each transmitter along the route to the final destination , we define a selection region by two parameters : a selection angle @xmath31 and a reference distance @xmath32 , as shown by the shaded area in fig .",
    "1 , where the selection region is defined as the region that is located within angle @xmath31 and outside the arc @xmath33 with @xmath34 . here",
    ", the transmitter is placed in the circle center @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 points to the direction of the final destination . at each hop , the relay is selected as the nearest receiver node to the transmitter among the nodes in the selection region .",
    "the reason that we limit the selection region within an angle @xmath31 is explained as follows : in multi - hop routing , a transmission is inefficient if the projection of transmission distance on the directional line from the transmitter towards the final destination is negative , or less efficient if the projection is positive but very small .",
    "therefore , here we set a limiting angle @xmath38 with which each packet traverses at each hop within @xmath39 $ ] .        compared with the model in @xcite , where the authors assume that the relays are equidistantly placed along a line from the source to the destination as shown in fig . 2",
    ", here our model assumes that the intermediate relays are randomly distributed over the selection region following a homogenous ppp ( @xmath8 ) with density @xmath9 , which is more practical .",
    "in this section , we optimize the selection region to derive the optimum values for the selection angle @xmath31 and the reference distance @xmath32 by maximizing the expected density of progress .    as in @xcite , the density of progress",
    "is defined as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the successful transmission probability defined in ( 2 ) , @xmath42 is the projection of the transmission distance @xmath11 along the directional line @xmath37 . since the receivers follow a homogeneous ppp with density @xmath43 , the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the transmission distance @xmath11 is given as @xmath44,{r_m } \\le r <      \\infty.\\ ] ] since @xmath38 is uniformly distributed over @xmath39 $ ] , which is independent of @xmath11 , the expected density of progress is given by @xmath45 & = p\\lambda \\int\\limits_{r_m}^\\infty \\int\\limits_{-\\frac{\\varphi}{2}}^{\\frac{\\varphi}{2 } }   { { e^ { - p\\lambda t{x^2 } } } } x \\cos \\phi { f_{d}}(x)d\\phi dx   \\nonumber\\\\    & = \\sqrt \\lambda   p(1 - p)\\gamma \\left(\\frac{3}{2},kr_m^2\\right){k^ { - 3/2}}\\exp \\left(\\lambda ( 1 - p)\\frac{\\varphi } { 2}r_m^2\\right)\\sin \\left(\\frac{\\varphi    } { 2}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the pdf of @xmath11 obtained from ( 4 ) , @xmath47 , @xmath48 is defined in ( 3a ) , and @xmath49 is the incomplete gamma function .    to optimize the objective function in ( 5 ) , we first assume that @xmath31 is constant , and try to derive the optimum value of @xmath32 . for brevity , in the following derivation",

    ". however , the global optimum must be among all the roots of the above equation , which can be found numerically . since it is difficult to analytically derive the exact solution for @xmath32 from ( 9 )",
    ", we turn to get an upper bound of @xmath32 . since @xmath56 \\nonumber\\\\      & = \\frac{1}{2}\\exp \\left ( - kr_m^2\\right)\\left(2 + kr_m^2\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by ( 9 )",

    "3 , we compare the upper bound of the optimum @xmath32 with the numerically computed optimal value when @xmath59 . we see that when transmission probability @xmath4 increases , the upper bound becomes tighter .    now let s maximize the objective function by jointly optimizing @xmath32 and @xmath31 .",
    "rewrite ( 5 ) as @xmath60 for brevity , let us denote @xmath61 as @xmath62 and @xmath52 as @xmath63 . with partial derivatives , we have @xmath64 = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this holds only if @xmath65    since @xmath47 , there is @xmath66 . to simplify things",
    ", we can then calculate the derivative with respect to @xmath26 instead of @xmath31 as    & = p(1 - p ) ( - ptr_m^2 ) + & = 0 .    since the factor in @xmath62 and @xmath63 related to @xmath26 and @xmath32",
    "is only @xmath67 , thus we get @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    therefore , with ( 14 ) , we have @xmath70    applying ( 16 ) to ( 15 ) , the following holds : @xmath71\\gamma e + \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\varphi } { 2}\\right){k^ { - 1}}\\lambda ptr_m^2\\gamma e = 0.\\ ] ]    after some calculation , ( 17 ) is simplified as @xmath72    since it is hard to derive close - formed solutions for the optimal @xmath32 and @xmath31 , respectively , we implicitly use @xmath31 and @xmath4 to express the optimal @xmath32 as    @xmath73    note that @xmath32 scales as @xmath74 , which intuitively makes sense . since as the density increases , the interferers relative distance to the receiver decreases as @xmath75",
    ", it requires a shorter transmission distance by the same amount to keep the required sinr . by applying ( 19 ) in ( 5 ) , we observe that ( 5 ) becomes @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a constant independent of @xmath3 .",
    "this means that the maximum expected density of progress scales as @xmath0 , which conforms to the results in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present some numerical results based on the analysis in section iii .",
    "we choose the path - loss exponent @xmath78 as 3 , the node density @xmath3 as 1 , and the outage threshold @xmath19 as 10 db . in figs . 4 and 5 , we plot the expected density of progress vs. the reference distance @xmath32 and the selection angle @xmath31 , with @xmath79 and 0.05 , respectively .",
    "we see that for each @xmath4 there exists an optimum selection angle and an optimum reference range when the respective partial derivatives are zero as discussed in section iii .            in fig .",
    "6 , we plot the optimum selection angle obtained numerically vs. the transmission probability .",
    "as shown in the figure , we see that the increment of transmission probability leads to the increase of the optimum selection angle .",
    "this can be explained as follows : the increment of transmission probability means the decrement of the number of nodes that can be selected as relays ; therefore the selection angle should be enlarged to extend the selection region .        in fig .",
    "7 , we compare the optimum reference distance obtained numerically with that derived in ( 19 ) , where @xmath31 is chosen optimally as that in fig .",
    "we see that the increment of transmission probability leads to the decease of reference distance .",
    "this can be explained as follows : the increment of transmission probability means more simultaneous concurrent transmissions such that the interference will be increased ; therefore the reference transmission distance should be decreased to guarantee the quality of the received signal and the probability of successful transmission .    in fig .",
    "[ 7 ] , we compare the performance of our routing protocol with that in @xcite , and also with the optimized ( with optimum angle ) nearest neighbor routing shown in fig .",
    "5 of @xcite and the non - optimized ( with an arbitrary angle , e.g. , @xmath80 ) nearest neighbor routing in @xcite .            from fig . 8",
    ", we have the following observations and interpretations : 1)when @xmath4 increases , the performance of our routing protocol becomes close to that of the nearest neighbor routing with an optimum angle .",
    "this can be explained from fig . 7 as : when @xmath4 increases , the reference distance @xmath32 tends to be a small value close to zero ; thus our routing scheme degenerates to the nearest neighbor routing .",
    "furthermore , our routing protocol shows much better performance than the non - optimized ( with non - optimized angle ) nearest neighbor routing , and this advantage is due to adopting both the optimum selection angle and the optimum reference distance . in this case , the selection region based routing can also be considered as the optimized nearest neighbor routing given the selection angle and the reference distance ; 2 ) we see that when at the optimum selection angle and the optimum reference distance , the optimum transmission probability is approximately 0.05 .",
    "although in this paper we mainly focus on the optimization of the selection region , this observation indicates that there also exists an optimum transmission probability with our model , which has been discussed in some other prior literature , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig . 8 , for multi - hop ad hoc networks , in terms of the performance metric of expected density of process , baccelli _",
    "et al_. s routing strategy is the best , by design at each hop the transmitter chooses a relay that provides the maximum value of progress towards the destination .",
    "however , the computational complexity with this protocol might be high , since the transmitter at each hop should compute the successful transmission probability @xmath81 together with the projection of transmission distance , and accordingly evaluate the value of progress towards the destination for each receiver , further choose the one with the greatest value of progress as the relay .    in our protocol as we see from fig . 8 , when @xmath4 is small",
    ", its performance is close to that of baccelli _ et al .",
    "_ , while the computational complexity per hop is reduced significantly :    \\1 ) the nodes involved in the relay selection process are limited to a small region .",
    "as relays are selected from the receiver nodes in the selection region , the number of nodes participating in the relay selection is reduced with a ratio @xmath82 compared with that in @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) unlike that in @xcite , where the successful transmission probability @xmath81 , the projection of transmission distance , and further the value of progress towards the destination for each potential relay need to be calculated ; we only need to calculate the distance between the transmitter and the potential relays .",
    "also note that our new protocol could be easily implemented by deploying directional antennas in the transmitter , where the spread angle can be set equal to the optimum selection angle . in this case not only the network computational complexity but also the interference will be reduced , which will be addressed in our future work .",
    "in this paper , we propose a selection region based multi - hop routing protocol for random mobile ad hoc networks , where the selection region is defined by two parameters , a selection angle and a reference distance . by maximizing the expected density of progress , we present some analytical results on how to refine the selection region . compared with the previous results in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , we consider the transmission direction at each hop towards the final destination to guarantee relay efficiency . compared with the protocol in @xcite , the optimum selection region defined in this paper limits the area in which the relay is being selected , and the routing computational complexity at each hop is reduced .",
