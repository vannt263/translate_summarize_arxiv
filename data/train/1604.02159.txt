    "riemannian symmetric spaces are characterized by the existence of special isometries called _ central involutions _ : for each point @xmath2 of such a space @xmath3 , there exists an involution @xmath4 such that @xmath2 is an isolated fixed point of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the group of displacements of a riemannian symmetric space @xmath3 is the subgroup of the isometry group isom(@xmath3 ) which is generated by pairwise products of central involutions .",
    "it is a classical fact that for connected symmetric spaces , it coincides with the identity component @xmath7 ( see for example proposition  iv-1.4 of @xcite ) .",
    "this means that every isometry in the identity component is a product of a finite ( even ) number of central involutions .",
    "it is then a natural question to ask , given a symmetric space @xmath3 , what the central involution length of @xmath7 is , i.e. the smallest @xmath8 ( if any ) such that any element of @xmath7 is a product of at most @xmath1 central involutions .",
    "one can also relax the question to more general involutions , which is also of geometric interest as it allows for example to consider reflections , which have fixed - point loci of maximal ( rather than minimal ) dimension .",
    "basmajian and maskit investigated in @xcite the involution length of @xmath9 when @xmath3 is a symmetric space of constant ( sectional ) curvature , i.e. one of the model spaces @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "they found that , allowing orientation - reversing involutions the involution length is always 2 , whereas if one restricts to orientation - preserving involutions ( i.e. involutions in the identity component @xmath7 ) it is 2 or 3 , depending explicitly on the space and the congruence class of @xmath1 mod .",
    "they deduce from these facts that every element of @xmath7 is a commutator , i.e. the commutator length of @xmath7 is 1 .",
    "this follows from the remark that every square of a triple product of involutions is a commutator",
    ". indeed , for any triple of involutions @xmath13 , we have    @xmath14.\\ ] ]    in this paper we study the analogous question in @xmath9 when @xmath3 is complex hyperbolic space @xmath15 , the model complex symmetric space of constant negative holomorphic sectional curvature . here",
    "@xmath9 has 2 connected components , one consisting of all holomorphic isometries ( the identity component , isomorphic to @xmath16 ) and the other consisting of all antiholomorphic isometries .",
    "it is well known that any element of @xmath16 is a product of 2 antiholomorphic involutions ( usually called _ real reflections _ ) ;",
    "this was originally observed by falbel and zocca in @xcite when @xmath17 then for all values of @xmath1 by choi in @xcite ( see also @xcite , and @xcite for the elliptic case , corresponding to @xmath18 ) .",
    "however , only special elements of @xmath16 are products of two holomorphic involutions ( see lemma  [ doubleproducts ] in the case of pu(2,1 ) ) .",
    "the involution length of @xmath16 is thus at least 3 ( for @xmath19 ) .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ main ] the involution length of @xmath20 is 4 .",
    "( we also show the analogous statements where `` involution '' is replaced by `` central involution '' , or by `` complex reflection of order 2 '' . ) more specifically , we show that all loxodromic and parabolic isometries in @xmath20 are triple products of involutions , whereas some elliptic conjugacy classes are not .",
    "more precisely , we give in proposition [ prop - ell - triple ] and corollary [ coro - ell - triple ] a precise description of those regular elliptic elements that are not products of three involutions .",
    "this description is made in terms of the _ angle pair _ of an elliptic isometry .",
    "elliptic isometries preserve two orthogonal complex lines on which they act by rotation ; the angle pair is the pair formed by these two rotation angles ( see section [ section - ell - classes ] ) .",
    "the angle pair determines the conjugacy class of an elliptic element .",
    "it should be noted that there is a slight subtlety here .",
    "loxodromic conjugacy classes in pu(2,1 ) are determined unambiguously by the trace of any lift to su(2,1 ) .",
    "this is not the case for elliptic isometries : for a given value of the trace , there are generically three possible angle pairs , which correspond to the various possible relative positions of eigenvectors and the light - cone in @xmath21 ( see section [ section - ell - classes ] ) . in particular , one can show that any complex number can be realized as the trace of a triple product of involutions though not all isometries are products of three involutions .",
    "our method is based on the use of the product map on the product of two semisimple conjugacy classes ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath22 and @xmath23 be two conjugacy classes .",
    "the product map on @xmath24 is defined by @xmath25 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the space of conjugacy classes of pu(2,1 ) ( see section [ space - conj ] ) and @xmath27 $ ] denotes the conjugacy class of an element .",
    "we review the main properties of this map in section [ section - product - map ] .",
    "the image by @xmath28 of reducible pairs @xmath29 form the so - called _",
    "reducible walls _ that divide @xmath26 into _",
    "chambers_. the crucial fact is that when @xmath22 and @xmath23 are semisimple classes , these chambers are either full or empty , i.e. @xmath30 is a union of chamber closures ( see sections [ section - closed ] , [ section - open ] ) . in our case",
    "we consider this map when @xmath22 is the conjugacy class of a product of two involutions and @xmath23 is the conjugacy class of an involution . applying this method",
    "we are able to determine which elliptic and loxodromic conjugacy classes are triple products of involutions .",
    "we have to deal with parabolic conjugacy classes separately as they are nt semisimple and can not be separated from conjugacy classes of complex reflections . to prove that the involution length of pu(2,1 ) is 4 , we show that the map @xmath28 becomes surjective when both @xmath22 and @xmath23 are conjugacy classes of products of two involutions .",
    "we also obtain as a byproduct of these results that @xmath20 has commutator length 1 ( theorem  [ comm ] ) , but slightly more indirectly than in @xcite .",
    "indeed , we show that even though not every element of @xmath20 is a triple product of involutions , it is the square of a triple product of involutions and conclude using .    in higher dimensions ,",
    "i.e. in @xmath16 with @xmath0 , the involution length will be at least 3 , for the same reason as above ( pairwise products of involutions have special properties ) .",
    "however the finer methods that we use in this work to improve the lower bound to 4 ( so , prove that not every element is a product of 3 involutions ) , and provide an upper bound of 4 ( so , prove that every element is a product of 4 involutions ) do not extend easily to higher dimensions , as they rely on a detailed understanding the chamber structure in the space of elliptic conjugacy classes in @xmath20 ( see section [ section - product - map ] for more details ) , which gets significantly more complicated in higher dimensions .",
    "djokovic and malzan proved in @xcite that the length of @xmath31 with respect to complex reflections of order 2 is @xmath32 , and in @xcite that the corresponding length in @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 ) is @xmath35 or @xmath36 ( depending on the parity of @xmath37 ) . by combining our results for @xmath17 with results of @xcite ( namely their bound on the involution length of @xmath31 ) we obtain the following result ( theorem  [ invollengthn ] ) :    [ invollengthn ] for all @xmath19 , the involution length of pu(@xmath1,1 ) is at most 8 .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "we introduce the product map and describe the general strategy to determine its image .",
    "we then apply this strategy in sections  [ section - triple - loxo ] and [ section - reg - ell - product ] , to determine which loxodromic and regular elliptic isometries are products of three involutions .",
