    "it is currently widely accepted that inflationary cosmological scenarios offer most promising explanations for the initial conditions for structure formation in our universe .",
    "almost all inflationary scenarios predict that the primordial density perturbation spectrum deviates slightly from a power law and is dominated by scalar density fluctuations .",
    "typically , the scalar density perturbation spectrum is parameterized as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a scale dependent function which is usually called the running ( scalar ) spectral index ( running refers to the change in the spectral index as a function of wavenumber @xmath7 ) . combining observations of cmb , galaxy surveys , and ly@xmath8 forest , there have been claims for evidence of strongly running spectral index ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but at the moment , combined data set favors no spectral index running ( e.g. @xcite ) . nonetheless , a significant running of the spectral index is still a debatable possibility that will be settled by future experiments .    according to the cmb and 2dfgrs galaxy survey data  @xcite , @xmath9 furthermore ,",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , within the context of single field inflationary models , there is some indication that the spectral index quantity @xmath10 runs from positive values ( blue ) on long length scales to negative values ( red ) on short length scales ( positive to negative within about 5 e - folds ) .",
    "it is well known @xcite that one robust check of slow roll inflationary scenario is what is usually referred to as the single field self - consistency condition @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the spectral index of tensor perturbation power spectrum parameterized as @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the slow roll parameter characterizing the tensor to scalar power spectrum ratio . in @xcite , it was pointed out that if running occurs from blue to red , then there may be another approximate consistency condition that we may observationally aim at checking regarding inflationary scenarios .",
    "namely , within the single field slow roll scenario , there should be an approximate coincidence between the length scale @xmath15 at which @xmath16 and the length scale @xmath17 at which the tensor to scalar ratio reaches a minimum , i.e. @xmath18 if true , this kind of new consistency condition would be important because currently there is only a very limited number of observational consistency checks that could support the picture of inflationary origin of density perturbations .",
    "the degree to which @xmath19 depends on a ) how fast @xmath20 runs and b ) the slow roll parameter @xmath14 ( this is true at least in the leading slow roll order approximation ) .",
    "hence , it is not clear how compelling the expectation of this coincidence is . for example , does eq .",
    "( [ eq : maincoincidence ] ) occur only for 1 out of 10,000 slow roll models of inflation with running spectral index or does it occur for 9000 out of 10,000 slow roll models of inflation ?",
    "furthermore , because of the strongly running behavior of the spectral index , it was not clear that the leading order presented in @xcite was robust .",
    "hence , in this paper , we quantify the degree to which one would find the approximate consistency condition a compelling consistency check of single field inflationary scenario .",
    "furthermore , we check that the qualitative expectation based on first order slow roll expansion is also valid at second order slow roll expansion .    in the spirit of @xcite , we examine a grid of slow roll models and ask how the distribution of @xmath21 changes as a function of increasing the requirement of running spectral index . expressed in terms of difference in the e - folds of inflation ( expressed as @xmath22 ) , we find @xmath23 has a mean of about @xmath24 with a @xmath25 width of @xmath26 when a strong running condition is imposed as when both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are satisfied . hence ,",
    "slow roll inflationary scenarios predict that there should be a coincidence of @xmath15 and @xmath17 within a factor of two if the spectrum runs from blue to red , and the mismatch is such that @xmath29 . furthermore ,",
    "since the @xmath25 width of the distribution without strong running condition is about @xmath30 , we find quantitative evidence that if the spectral index runs strongly , there is an increase in the coincidence as expected .",
    "there are two main caveats to our results . as discussed in section [ sec : discconc ] , because the b - mode polarization sensitive to tensor perturbations is expected to peak on relatively large angular scales where it is measurable with current forecasts @xcite while the minimum of tensor to scalar ratio lies on shorter angular scales , measurements testing the proposed approximate consistency condition may be difficult .",
    "if strong running is relevant to cosmology , ingenuity of scientists in the future will hopefully overcome this obstacle .",
    "the second is that the grid of models that we choose are sampled with equal weight for the initial conditions of the slow roll equation .",
    "although this is commonly found in the literature @xcite and does not seem to be an unreasonable way to sample the possible set of models , this kind of probability measure does not have any justification from first principles .",
    "a similar ambiguity of measure plagues most `` landscape '' or anthropic principle arguments ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we analytically compute the coincidence in terms of slow roll parameters . following that we present numerical results .",
    "measurement prospects are then discussed in section [ sec : discconc ] . in the appendix , we collect some useful slow roll formulas used in the derivations in the paper . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the convention @xmath31 .",
    "let us see why there should be an approximate consistency condition as described in the introduction . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that within the context of a single real scalar field @xmath32 slow roll inflationary model with a potential @xmath33 , one can write @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the usual inflationary slow roll parameter in terms of the potential , the upper ( lower ) sign is for @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) . since the tensor to scalar ratio is given by @xmath38 , the vanishing of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : oldwork ] ) corresponds to the scale at which the tensor to scalar power reaches an extremum .",
    "now , the observation that was made was that if the spectrum runs from blue to red , then @xmath39 will be positive initially , but as @xmath40 becomes negative to the point of canceling the @xmath41 , @xmath42 will vanish .",
    "as long as @xmath43 is small and/or @xmath40 runs strongly negative , the scale at which @xmath40 crosses zero will coincide with the extremum of @xmath43 which in turn corresponds to the extremum of the tensor to scalar ratio .    in this section",
    "we will extend the previous derivation to second order in slow roll and confirm the qualitative validity of the previous results .",
    "this is reassuring given that the validity of leading order results was questionable in light of strongly running behavior .",
    "to accomplish this task , we will work with hubble flow slow roll expansion techniques ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of the hubble flow approach is that it is simpler to go to higher orders in derivative expansion .    using the conventions of @xcite",
    ", we use the definitions for the slow roll parameters in terms of the hubble function @xmath44 as follows : @xmath45\\cr { } ^\\ell\\lambda_{\\rm h } & \\equiv & \\left({m_p^2 \\over 4 \\pi}\\right)^\\ell { \\left(h'\\right)^{\\ell-1 } \\over h^\\ell } { d^{(\\ell+1 ) } h \\over d\\phi^{(\\ell + 1)}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the hubble function is defined by the hamilton - jacobi equations @xmath46 which has the advantage of having a readily solvable model of power law inflation . as is well known ,",
    "hubble flow slow roll expansion that we summarize below is a derivative expansion in @xmath47 about the power law inflationary model .",
    "we used @xmath48 as the measure of time during inflation , the number of e - folds before the end of inflation , which increases as one goes _",
    "backward _ in time : @xmath49 with the sign convention @xmath50 these equations implies a relationship of @xmath14 to @xmath51 and @xmath48 : @xmath52    the evolution of the higher order parameters during inflation is determined by a set of `` flow '' equations @xcite , @xmath53 \\left({}^\\ell\\lambda_{\\rm h}\\right ) + { } ^{\\ell+1}\\lambda_{\\rm h}.\\label{eqfullflowequations}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as one can see , in general any slow roll parameter could be expressed in terms of one single slow roll and its derivatives .",
    "some of these relationships are explicitly given in the appendix .",
    "note that @xmath14 has the interpretation through the fact that tensor to scalar power spectrum is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the usual power spectrum for tensor and scalar gauge invariant metric perturbations .",
    "let us now solve for the difference between the length scale at which @xmath14 reaches an extremum ( @xmath57 ) and the length scale at which @xmath40 crosses 0 ( @xmath58 ) . instead of giving the length scale in terms of the inverse wave vector , we will express it terms of the difference in the horizon exit e - folds @xmath23 . to translate that into ratio of lengths ,",
    "one simply has @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the expansion rate when @xmath17 left the horizon and @xmath61 is the expansion rate when @xmath15 left the horizon .",
    "since @xmath62 is of order of the slow roll parameter during the early stages of inflation , one can disregard this term when interpreting @xmath63 as long as it is larger than about @xmath64 . defining @xmath65 as the point where the extremum of @xmath14 occurs ,",
    "i.e. @xmath66 , we can linearize @xmath40 around it to solve approximately for @xmath23 . using the formulas given in the appendix",
    ", we can write @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69\\dot{\\epsilon } + \\ddot{\\epsilon}(3-c)-8\\epsilon^3(\\epsilon+1)\\}.\\ ] ] solving @xmath70 for @xmath23 , we obtain @xmath71 the constant @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is euler s constant . as it can be seen from this formula @xmath23 clusters around the negative value @xmath74 and it can be positive or negative .",
    "we can also observe that stronger running ( associated with a higher slope for @xmath0 ) drifts @xmath23 toward more negative values , and that this effect is modulated by the value of @xmath14 at @xmath65 .",
    ", @xmath56 ( scalar power spectrum ) , and @xmath40 as functions of the number of e - folds @xmath48 , it can be seen that the extrema of @xmath14 and @xmath56 are closed to the point where @xmath40 is zero .",
    "the dot dashed curve is @xmath75 , the solid curve is @xmath76 , and the dotted curve is @xmath40 .",
    "the horizontal axis is oriented such that inflation ends at @xmath77 ( i.e. time flows right to left ) . ]",
    "we will see that numerical results agree well with the analytical approximation . before going onto numerical analysis , we would like to note that beyond eq .",
    "( [ eq : oldwork ] ) , there may be many more `` approximate consistency '' conditions associated with strong running since we are merely labeling various features of the slow roll equations .",
    "for example , as it can be inferred already from the first order formula @xmath78 the power spectrum will have an extremum roughly coinciding with the extrememum of @xmath14 . to check this numerically",
    ", we can examine an example of an inflationary model ( as explained in the next section ) . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : p - e - n - plot ] , the scalar power spectrum has an extremum very closed to the point where @xmath40 is zero .",
    "we could proceed similarly to the way we have done for eq .",
    "( [ eq : maincoincidence ] ) , comparing analytical approximation to numerical data for this `` approximate consistency '' condition , which in this case would not depend on the strength of the running of the spectral index , but could be another test for more general inflation models .",
    "in this section , we study our proposed approximate consistency condition question numerically .",
    "one scientific question we would like to address is , `` what is the expected coincidence of the value @xmath15 satisfying @xmath79 with the value @xmath17 satisfying @xmath80 ? ''",
    "the second question is whether a stronger negative running of the spectral index makes the expected @xmath81 significantly smaller .    to this end",
    ", we examine a particular grid ( to be specified below ) of slow roll inflationary models . in this grid of models",
    ", we make a set of `` cuts '' which select out subsets of the models with scalar spectral index running from blue to red . in this way",
    ", we can make a histogram of models as a function @xmath23 ( defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltan ] ) ) .",
    "the peak and the width of the histogram quantifies the expected coincidence of @xmath15 with @xmath17 , answering our first question . we then make the cuts more stringent such that only those slow roll models with more strongly running spectral indices are included in the histogram .",
    "the degree to which the width of the histogram changes as we make the required running stronger answers our second question .",
    "let us now explain the details which closely follows the methods of @xcite . assigning a set of initial conditions to eqs .",
    "( [ eqfullflowequations ] ) and integrating them specifies a flow of the slow roll function .",
    "each of the initial conditions corresponds to a particular choice of inflaton potential and the inflaton initial conditions .",
    "we choose initial values for the parameters at random from the following ranges , assuming a uniform probability distribution : @xmath82\\cr \\epsilon & = & \\left[6\\ 10^{-76},0.6\\right]\\cr \\sigma & = & \\left[-0.5,0.5\\right]\\cr { } ^2\\lambda_{\\rm h } & = & \\left[-0.05,0.05\\right]\\cr { } ^3\\lambda_{\\rm h } & = & \\left[-0.025,0.025\\right],\\cr & \\cdots&\\cr { } ^{m+1}\\lambda_{\\rm h } & = & 0.\\label{eqinitialconditions}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we truncated the expansion to order 5 by setting @xmath83 .",

    "1 can then be described as follows :    1 .",
    "a set of random initial conditions was generated for the value of the slow roll parameters at @xmath103 .",
    "the following constraints are imposed : @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106 where @xmath107 is fixed to 0.3 and @xmath108 varies from 0 to 0.225 for different cuts with a 0.075 increment . if these constraints are respected , proceed to step 2 otherwise go back to step 1 .",
    "2 .   integrate the flow equation ( using lsoda from odepack @xcite ) to @xmath109 and then check the following constraints : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is fixed to -0.3 and @xmath112 varies from 0 to -0.225 for different cuts with a 0.075 increment . if these are respected go to step 3 otherwise go to step 1 .",
    "evolve forward in time ( @xmath113 ) until inflation ends ( @xmath114).if the total number of e - folds @xmath48 from the beginning to the end of inflation is in the range [ 40,70 ] add this model to the ensemble of acceptable models .",
    "if not go back to step 1 .",
    "repeat step 1 through 3 until the desired number of acceptable models have been found .",
    "once the set of acceptable models has been generated we solve numerically the following two equations : @xmath115 @xmath116 it is important to observe that the presence of the square root of @xmath14 in the definition of the differential operator @xmath117 ( eq .  ( [ eq : ddn ] ) ) causes numerical solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsprime ] ) to be difficult for small values of @xmath14 , since small values of the derivative may be associated to the smallness of @xmath14 more than to the actual presence of an extremum . in other words , even though the derivatives are taken with respect to @xmath48 , for inflaton potentials with very small @xmath14 , the derivatives become very small , requiring high numerical precision . for this reason and to discard inflection points , extrema are identified numerically using the second derivative information as well .    before making the histogram , we must further check that the models in the histogram are reasonable from an inflationary phenomenology point of view .",
    "this is done in lieu of executing precision fits to all available data since it has been well demonstrated by previous analyses ( see for example @xcite ) that the current cmb data are not extremely constraining in terms of the details of the slow roll inflationary models .",
    "hence , our histogram should not be sensitive to the lack of precision in our cuts .",
    "on the other hand , given that the combined fits including sdss data as carried out by @xcite prefer small running , the strongly running cases of the current analysis may have been statistically disfavored had precision fits to combined data been made . given that most of the numerically generated models do not have strongly running spectral index for the weakest cut , the results of the weakest cut should be robust with respect to imposing additional fit constraints , while the results of the stronger cuts should be interpreted with appropriate caution .",
    "let us now write explicitly the constraint equations . since the wmap analysis  @xcite gives @xmath118",

    "the physical reason for eq .",
    "( [ eq : yconst ] ) is that upper and lower bounds on the potential ( coming from tensor perturbations and reheating temperature , respectively ) directly translates into upper and lower bounds @xmath14 because of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : powerobserve ] ) and ( [ eq : approxpzeta ] ) . the physical origin of eq .",

    ", b - mode polarization observations are necessary to reliably infer the tensor perturbation amplitudes .",
    "as is well known , b - mode polarization has the advantage over the e - mode polarization in that at the last scattering surface , the b - mode polarization can not be generated by scalar perturbations alone because to leading order , the scalar perturbations do not generate nonzero @xmath156 amplitudes in the temperature anisotropy while the tensor modes can .",
    "hence , in principle , assuming no large contamination from vector perturbations , b - mode polarization measurement offers a direct way to infer tensor perturbation amplitudes .",
    "the difficulty with measuring the b - mode polarization spectrum coming from gravity waves is that because its amplitude is proportional to the local quadrupole anisotropy induced by the time derivative @xmath157 ( where @xmath158 is the amplitude of the gravitational wave ) localized at the last scattering surface ( due to the requirement of thomson scattering ) , its amplitude is suppressed at least by order @xmath159 on long wavelengths with respect to the temperature anisotropy ( where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are the hubble radius and the scale factor at recombination , respectively ) .",
    "furthermore , since gravitational wave mode amplitudes inside the horizon are diluted by the expansion of the spatial volume , the transfer function should behave approximately as @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the scale factor today and @xmath164 is the redshift to the last scattering surface .",
    "( here , we have considered only the modes that entered the horizon after matter domination , i.e. @xmath165 . ) hence , the b - polarization temperature perturbation amplitude can be written as @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the power spectrum of the tensor perturbations .",
    "( for discussions of analytic treatments of cmb polarization , see e.g. @xcite . )",
    "this peaks at @xmath168 , and even there , the amplitude is suppressed by about @xmath169 relative to the temperature anisotropies if the tensor perturbation amplitude is about the same as scalar perturbations amplitudes .",
    "to make the situation slightly worse , @xmath15 is expected to be at around @xmath170 .",
    "( note that to map the wave vectors @xmath171 to the multipole moment number @xmath172 , one can use the approximate formula @xmath173 . )",
    "this means that to actually measure @xmath21 , one must go to short scales ( @xmath174 ) while the b - mode polarization measurements prefer large length scales ( @xmath175 ; for more accurate plots of examples , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hence , experimental confirmation of the approximate consistency conditions will be a challenge .",
    "there is one more obstacle that makes it difficult for tensor perturbation amplitudes to be extracted from b - mode polarization measurements .",
    "this is due to the fact that e - modes can be converted into b - modes through gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "hence , obtaining a tensor spectrum to check the approximate consistency condition requires success in extracting the tensor perturbation contribution even at relatively short length scales , around where the lensing contribution most likely dominates over the gravitational wave signal .",

    "<S> density perturbations generated from inflation almost always have a spectral index @xmath0 which runs ( varies with the wavelength ) . </S>",
    "<S> we explore a running spectral index scenario in which the scalar spectral index runs from blue ( @xmath1 ) on large length scales to red ( @xmath2 ) on short length scales . specifically , we look for a correlation between the length scale at which @xmath3 and the length scale at which tensor to scalar ratio @xmath4 reaches a minimum for single field slow roll inflationary models . by computing the distribution of length scale ratios , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that there indeed is a new approximate consistency condition that is characteristic of running spectral index scenarios that run from blue to red . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , with strong running , we expect 96% of the slow roll models to have the two length scales to be within a factor of 2 , with the length scale at which the tensor to scalar ratio reaching a minimum longer than the wavelength at which @xmath3 . </S>"
