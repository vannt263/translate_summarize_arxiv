    "the statements of saeki s results in the fourier  stieltjes setting are :    [ saeki ] let @xmath0 be a locally compact abelian group , and let @xmath8 be an idempotent function in @xmath7 so that @xmath9 for some nonempty @xmath10",

    "( @xcite ) if @xmath12 , then @xmath3 is the union of two cosets of an open subgroup of @xmath0 but is not a coset itself .    for abelian @xmath0 ,",
    "it is well - known ( see @xcite ) that if @xmath3 is an open coset of @xmath0 , then @xmath13 , and whereas if @xmath3 is the union of two cosets of an open subgroup of @xmath0 but is not a coset itself , then @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the `` relative order '' of the two cosets forming @xmath3 .",

    "in particular , the number @xmath18 in theorem [ saeki ] ( i ) is sharp .",
    "the paper @xcite asked whether or not the interval @xmath20 in theorem [ saeki ] ( ii ) could be increased to @xmath21 , and we answer this in affirmative in theorem [ stronger version of saeki ] . note that the interval @xmath21 is sharp because of the discussion in the previous paragraph and also since there are idempotents @xmath22 of @xmath7 with @xmath23 but @xmath3 is not any union of two cosets of open subgroup of @xmath0 ( see the last paragraph of @xcite ) .",
    "lesser is known about idempotents in @xmath7 with small norms for general locally compact group @xmath0 .",
    "ilie and spronk @xcite proved that @xmath22 is an idempotent in @xmath7 with @xmath13 if and only if @xmath3 is an open coset of @xmath0 .",

    "here @xmath24 is the completely bounded multiplier algebra @xmath24 of the fourier algebra @xmath27 and is defined as follows . since the fourier algebra @xmath27 is the predual of the group von neumann algebra @xmath28 , it has the canonical operator space structure , which makes it a completely contractive operator algebra ( see the monograph @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the completely bounded multiplier algebra @xmath24 of @xmath27 consists of those continuous functions @xmath29 such that the mapping @xmath30 is completely bounded , and its completely bounded norm is denoted as @xmath31 ( whereas the fourier  stieltjes norm on @xmath0 will be simply denoted as @xmath32 in this paper ) . in general",
    ", we have @xmath33 but , for amenable locally compact groups @xmath0 , @xmath34 thus an idempotent of @xmath7 with a small norm is always an idempotent of @xmath24 with a small(er ) norm .    in theorem [ stronger version of stan ]",
    ", we increase the number @xmath35 in stan s theorem [ stan ] to the sharp bound of @xmath18 , and so obtaining a generalisation of the first mentioned result of saeki , theorem [ saeki ] ( i ) , to general locally compact groups .",
    "in this section , let @xmath0 be any locally compact group , and let @xmath22 be an idempotent of @xmath24 with @xmath36 .",
    "our aim is to show that @xmath3 is an open coset of @xmath0 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath3 is open , and so , it remains to show that @xmath3 is a coset of @xmath0 . by (",
    "* corollary 6.3 ( i ) ) , it is sufficient for us to consider the case where @xmath0 is discrete .",
    "we first make a simple observation .    [ progression ] for any @xmath37 and @xmath38 , if @xmath39 ( resp .",
    "@xmath40 ) , then @xmath41 for every @xmath42 ( resp .",
    "@xmath43 for every @xmath42 ) .    by translation , we may ( and shall ) suppose that @xmath44 , the identity of @xmath0 .",
    "consider @xmath45 be the ( abelian ) group generated by @xmath46 , then @xmath47 so by saeki s theorem [ saeki ] ( i ) , we see that @xmath48 . this gives the lemma .    to get more information out of the assumption on @xmath49 , we shall follow in the footsteps of @xcite and use the connection shown in @xcite between the norm @xmath50 of @xmath24 and the schur multiplier norms described below .",
    "denote by @xmath51 the space of matrices that have only finitely many nonzero entries whose rows and columns are indexed by @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath51 is identified with a subspace of @xmath52 .",
    "recall that the _ schur multiplication _ of two matrices @xmath53 and @xmath54 , indexed by @xmath0 , is defined as @xmath55 and for each matrix @xmath53 , indexed by @xmath0 , its _ schur multiplier norm _ is @xmath56 of course , this discussion works for any index set @xmath0 , and a particular matrix that is useful for us is the following @xmath57 matrix @xmath58 using the orthogonal matrix @xmath59 and the vector @xmath60 , we see that @xmath61 as a matter of fact , it is proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 5.1(8 ) ) that @xmath62 , but the above simple calculation is sufficient for our purpose .",
    "hence , any matrix @xmath53 that has a submatrix of the form @xmath63 in must satisfy @xmath64    returning to our problem on the group @xmath0 , each function @xmath29 defines a matrix @xmath65 , indexed by @xmath0 , by setting @xmath66 an important fact shown in @xcite is that @xmath67 hence , the previous paragraph implies that @xmath68 can not have as a submatrix .    our main result of this section is the following .    [ stronger version of stan ]",
    "let @xmath0 be a locally compact group , and let @xmath8 be an idempotent function in @xmath24 so that @xmath9 for some nonempty @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath69 , then @xmath3 is an open coset of @xmath0 .",
    "as discussed above , we may ( and shall ) suppose that @xmath0 is discrete . also ,",
    "applying a translation if necessary , we suppose that @xmath70 .",
    "so it remains to prove that @xmath3 is a subgroup of @xmath0 .    by lemma [ progression ] , we see that if @xmath71 , then @xmath72 for every @xmath42 .",
    "thus it remains to show that @xmath3 is closed under multiplication .",
    "we next _ claim _ that if @xmath73 , then either @xmath74 or @xmath75 . indeed ,",
    "assume towards a contradiction that both @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "then the submatrix of @xmath68 with rows @xmath78 and colums @xmath79 is @xmath80 by the previous paragraph .",
    "this contradicts the previous discussion .",
    "finally , suppose that @xmath73 , the proof is completed if we can show that @xmath74 .",
    "the claim shows that either @xmath74 or @xmath75 . assume the latter holds , then from lemma [ progression ] with @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    ", we obtain that @xmath83 .",
    "since we must have @xmath84 , this in turn implies , by a similar argument , that @xmath85 .",
    "but then , since @xmath86 , we must have @xmath74 .",
    "hence , in any case , @xmath74 , and the proof is completed .",
    "in this section , let @xmath88 be a locally compact abelian group .",
    "we aim to strengthen saeki s theorem [ saeki ] ( ii ) by enlarging his range of @xmath20 to the optimal @xmath21 .",
    "so let @xmath22 be an idempotent function in @xmath7 with @xmath89 .",
    "actually , in @xcite , saeki works with idempotents of the measure algebra @xmath90 on a locally compact abelian group @xmath6 , and so , our @xmath0 and his @xmath6 could be considered as the pontryagin s duals of each other .",
    "thus @xmath91 isometrically , and we denote by @xmath92 the idempotent measure in @xmath90 that corresponds to @xmath22 .        [ saeki s lemma ] assume as above .",
    "suppose there exists @xmath93 and @xmath94 in @xmath3 and @xmath95 in @xmath0 such that @xmath96 belongs to @xmath3 but neither @xmath97 nor @xmath98 belongs to @xmath3 .",
    "then we have @xmath99 .    in the main argument , saeki uses this lemma to show that if @xmath3 is not the union of two cosets of a subgroup in @xmath0 , then @xmath100 .",
    "the argument used breaks the problem up into many cases , and in the cases where this lemma is not used , it is always shown that in fact @xmath101 . thus if we can strengthen this lemma , then theorem [ saeki ] ( ii )",
    "is strengthened also .",
    "in fact , we prove the following .",
    "let us define a function @xmath107 to be @xmath108 + ( x , v)[2 - ( x , w ) - ( x ,- w ) ] \\,.\\ ] ] if @xmath109 , we get @xmath110 , otherwise it will simply be @xmath111 .",
    "next , we calculate the uniform norm @xmath112 of @xmath113 , by taking @xmath114 , and set @xmath115",
