    "this paper deals with the rich variety of magnetic phenomena and phases that appear in strongly disordered and correlated electronic systems in the vicinity of a metal - insulator transition .",
    "in particular , much attention has been focussed on the ubiquitous `` local moments '' which appear to dominate the low temperature thermodynamics of the disordered metallic state , and also across the metal - insulator transition into the paramagnetic insulator ( quirt & marko 1971 ; ue & maekawa 1971 ; alloul & dellouve 1987 ; sachdev 1989 ; milovanovic _ et al .",

    "the principal thesis of this article is that these local moments are _ not _ directly related to the critical degrees of freedom leading to the metal - insulator transition .",
    "rather , they should be understood as the `` quantum griffiths '' precursors of the transition from a disordered metal to a _ metallic spin glass_.    below , we will review the basic ideas needed to motivate and explain this thesis .",
    "we will also discuss a recent mean field theory of the transition from the metal to the metallic spin glass ( sachdev _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; sengupta & georges 1995 ) and review its experimental consequences . we will not discuss the metal - insulator transition in the main part of the paper , but will speculate on the implications of our ideas for it in the concluding section .",
    "we will phrase our discussion in terms of the following hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 annihilates an electron on site @xmath2 with spin @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "the sites are placed in three dimensional space and labeled by @xmath5 .",
    "the electrons are in a chemical potential @xmath6 and repel each other with the on - site repulsion energy @xmath7 .",
    "the hopping matrix elements between the sites are the @xmath8 which are short - ranged and possibly random . finally , we also allow for some randomness in the on - site energies , @xmath9 .",
    "a hamiltonian of the form of @xmath10 is expected to be a good qualitative , if not quantitative , model of electronic motion in the impurity band of doped semiconductors , and this fact is the primary reason for focussing on it here .",
    "however , most of the discussion in this section is rather general and should apply to a wide variety of strongly disordered electronic systems .",
    "we begin with a simple but important question : on general grounds , what are the different possible ground states of @xmath10 between which it is possible to make a sharp distinction ? here",
    "we are considering two states distinct if a thermodynamic phase transition is required to connect one to the other .",
    "notice also that we are referring to phases at _ zero temperature _",
    "( @xmath11 ) so the phase transitions are necessarily quantum in nature . in some cases ,",
    "two phases separated by a quantum phase transition at zero temperature can be connected smoothly at any nonzero temperature , and so the sharp distinctions made below are special to @xmath12 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows a schematic @xmath12 phase diagram of @xmath10 as its couplings are varied ( an explicit computation of a related phase diagram on a cubic lattice has been presented by tusch & logan ( 1993,1995 ) ) .",
    "the phase diagram is a section in the parameter space of @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the mean value of the @xmath8 ) , the width of the distribution of the @xmath8 , the range of the @xmath8 , and the filling fraction .",
    "the phases are distinguished by the behavior of their spin and charge fluctuations .",
    "charge transport is characterized by the @xmath12 value of the conductivity , @xmath15 ; if @xmath16 the phase is an insulator , and is metallic otherwise . for the spin sector ,",
    "the uniform spin susceptibility is not a useful diagnostic ( as will become clear below ) , and we distinguish phases by whether the ground state has infinite memory of the spin orientation on a site or not .",
    "the time - averaged moment on a given site is denoted by @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 with @xmath19 the pauli matrices ) and it can either vanish at every site , or take a non - zero value which varies randomly from site to site .",
    "experimentally , a phase with @xmath20 non - zero will have an elastic delta function at zero frequency in the neutron scattering cross section .",
    "the average over all sites will be denoted by @xmath21 , and will be non - zero only in ferromagnetic phases , which we will not consider here .",
    "the four phases in figure  [ fig1 ] are :    \\(1 ) metallic quantum paramagnet ( mqp ) more simply known as the familiar ` metal ' , this phase has @xmath22 the standard picture of this phase is in terms of low energy excitations consisting of spin-1/2 , charge @xmath23 , fermionic , itinerant quasiparticles .",
    "the quasiparticles obey a transport equation as in landau s fermi liquid theory , but have wave functions which are spatially disordered .",
    "many low temperature transport properties of these quasiparticles have been computed in a weak disorder expansion ( altshuler & aronov 1983 ; finkelstein 1983 , 1984 ; castellani & dicastro 1985 ; belitz & kirkpatrick 1994 ) . here , in section  [ lm ] , we will review more recent work ( milovanovic _ et al .",

    "_ 1994 ; langenfeld & wolfle 1995 ) that argues that this disordered fermi liquid is in fact unstable towards the formation of ` local moments ' of spin which modify most of its thermodynamic properties . a careful definition of a local moment , and its physical properties will appear in section  [ lm ] , but loosely speaking , a local moment is a site with a strongly localized charge @xmath23 and relatively slow spin fluctuations .",
    "the spin fluctuations , although long - lived , eventually lose memory of their orientation , and we always have @xmath24 .",
    "there are large fluctuations in the lifetime of the spin orientations on the local moment sites , and those with the longest lifetimes may be considered as the `` quantum griffiths '' precursors ( defined more carefully later ) of the metallic spin glass to be considered below .",
    "\\(2 ) insulating quantum paramagnet ( iqp ) this phase has @xmath25 and is accessed by a metal - insulator transition from the mqp phase .",
    "the itinerant quasiparticles have now localized : this prevents them from contributing to a d.c .",
    "conductivity , but many of their thermodynamic effects are expected to be similar to those in the mqp phase , particularly when the quasiparticle localization length is large .",
    "there is however no sharp distinction between the localized quasiparticles and the local moments , and at scales larger than the localization length one may view the iqp simply as a collection of randomly located spins with @xmath26 and interacting with one another by some effective exchange interaction .",
    "there is a large density of low energy spin excitations , which means that the spin susceptibility is quite large , and may even diverge as @xmath27 ( ma _ et al .",
    "_ 1979 ; dasgupta & ma 1980 ; hirsch 1980 ; bhatt & lee 1982 ) .",
    "this is the reason we have not used the spin susceptibility as a diagnostic for the phases .",
    "an exact solution of an iqp model with infinite - range exchange was presented recently by sachdev & ye ( 1993 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) metallic spin glass ( msg ) this phase has @xmath28 and is accessed from the mqp by a spin - freezing transition .",
    "the local moments of the mqp phase now acquire a definite orientation , and retain memory of this orientation for infinite time .",
    "the fermi liquid quasiparticle excitations are still present and are responsible for the non - zero @xmath15 ; the frozen moments appear as random local magnetic fields to the itinerant quasiparticles .",
    "alternatively , we may view the spin - freezing transition as the onset , from the mqp phase , of a spin density wave with random offsets in its phase and orientation , as appears to be the case in recent experiments ( lamelas _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) ; this suggests the name `` '' .",
    "the spin density glass point of view was explored by hertz ( 1979 ) some time ago , but he did not focus on the vicinity of the @xmath12 transition between the msg and mqp phases . here , in section  [ msg ] we will review the recent complete solution for the msg phase and the msg - mqp transition in the infinite range model ( sachdev _ et al .",

    "examples of phases of this type may be found in well known reviews ( binder & young 1986 ; fischer & hertz 1991 ) .",
    "we will not have anything to say about this phase here .",
    "let us emphasize that the above discussion was restricted to @xmath12 , and thus describes only the ground state properties of @xmath30 .",
    "we will discuss the finite @xmath11 properties below .",
    "well away from any of the quantum phase boundaries , the characteristics of the ground state are usually enough to give us a physical picture of the low @xmath11 properties .",
    "however , closer to the quantum phase boundaries or at higher @xmath11 , entirely new regimes emerge which can not be understood in terms of any of the phases describe above ; rather , they are characterized by the critical states at the phase boundaries , and their universal response to temperature ( sachdev & ye 1992 ; sachdev 1995 ) .",
    "this aspect of the physics will be explored in our discussion of the mqp - msg quantum phase transition .",
    "this section is about the magnetic properties of the mqp phase .",
    "the popular `` weakly - disordered fermi liquid '' approach to this phase computes its low temperature properties by an expansion in the strength of the random elastic scattering by impurities ( altshuler & aronov 1983 ; finkelstein 1983 , 1984 ; castellani & dicastro 1985 ; belitz & kirkpatrick 1994 ) . the main purpose of this section is to show that this weak scattering expansion misses an important piece of physics that actually dominates the low temperature thermodynamics and spin transport .",
    "the key phenomenon is the local instability of the interacting , disordered , fermi liquid to the appearance of magnetic moments whose slow dynamics controls the long - time spin correlations .",
    "an essential property of this instability is that it is caused by fluctuations in the disorder strength over a small , localized region of space ; it is not related to any development of coherence over large spatial scales .",
    "it may be viewed as another realization of the general class of `` quantum griffiths '' effects which have been very important in numerous recent studies of quantum phases and phase transitions in random spin systems ( fisher 1992 , 1995 ; thill & huse 1995 ; read _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; guo _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; senthil & sachdev 1996 ) . in the present case",
    "these griffiths effects are argued to be precursors of the metallic spin glass phase .",
    "that they disrupt what is usually considered to be an analysis of the metal - insulator transition is accidental : we argue they are not directly related to the metal - insulator transition and have clouded a proper interpretation of theories of it .",
    "we will begin by defining more carefully what we mean by a local moment in section  [ lm1 ] .",
    "then , in section  [ lm2 ] , we will describe the current theoretical understanding of the formation of these local moments in random systems , and their implications for experiments .",
    "unlike the sharply distinguishable zero temperature phases that were discussed in section  [ general ] , the concept of a local moment initially appears somewhat imprecise , and refers to intermediate energy phenomena at moderate , nonzero temperatures .",
    "alternatively , we may take a renormalization group point of view , and introduce local moments , as one renormalizes down from higher energies , as the degrees of freedom necessary for a proper description of the low energy excitations about the ground state . despite this seeming impreciseness , as we shall see below , the presence of local moments does lead to a qualitatively different description of the low temperature properties of disordered metals .    to explain the concept further , it is useful to specialize to a particular realization of @xmath10 ( milovanovic _ et al",
    ". _ 1989 ) : a single impurity model related to models considered early on by anderson ( 1961 ) and wolff ( 1961 ) .",
    "place all the sites , @xmath2 , on the vertices of a regular lattice , and set @xmath31 , @xmath32 between all nearest neighbors , and @xmath33 otherwise .",
    "now pick a special ` impurity ' site @xmath34 , and set all its nearest neighbor bonds @xmath35 .",
    "( see fig  [ fig2 ] ) .    .",
    "we choose the chemical potential @xmath36 so that the system is half - filled , and the resulting model is now characterized by two dimensionless parameters : @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we will now argue , using the results of extensive numerical and analytic studies on closely related models ( haldane 1978 ; krishnamurthy _ et al .",
    "_ 1980 ) , that there are two qualitatively distinct regimes in the @xmath37 and @xmath38 plane , characterized by very different behavior in their nonzero temperature properties .",
    "we will characterize the two regions by their local spin susceptibility , @xmath39 .",
    "this is their response to a magnetic field coupled to the site @xmath40 under which @xmath41 first consider the very high temperature limit @xmath42 . in this case",
    "all states are equally probably . on site @xmath40",
    "there are 4 possible configurations : empty , two electrons , one spin up electron , and one spin down electron . of these ,",
    "the latter two contribute a standard curie susceptibility of @xmath43 , while the first two have zero susceptibility .",
    "the average high temperature susceptibility is therefore @xmath44    now lower the temperature . the implication of the earlier work ( anderson 1961 ; wolff 1961 ; haldane 1978 ; krishnamurthy _ et al .",
    "_ 1980 ) is that there are two distinct possibilities in the @xmath37 , @xmath38 phase diagram :    \\(i ) _ itinerant quasiparticle regime _ the value of @xmath45 decreases monotonically from the high @xmath11 limit ( [ hight ] ) as @xmath11 is lowered .",
    "the states at the site @xmath40 are absorbed into the itinerant quasiparticle states of the surrounding sites , and the excitations at @xmath40 are typical of those of a fermi liquid . as @xmath27",
    "we therefore expect the constant pauli susceptibility @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the fermi energy .",
    "therefore @xmath48 as @xmath27 .",
    "this regime is clearly connected to the @xmath49 point where the site @xmath40 ceases to be special .",
    "\\(ii ) _ local moment regime _ now as @xmath11 is lowered below @xmath50 , the value of @xmath45 rises and reaches a plateau where @xmath51 ( the lower limit is the kondo temperature @xmath52 and will be discussed below . )",
    "the natural interpretation of this plateau is that two of the four possible states at site @xmath40 have been suppressed : the site @xmath40 either has one spin up electron , or one spin down electron , and it is extremely unlikely that it is in the state with no electrons or with two electrons in a spin singlet state .",
    "when this happens , we assert that a local moment has formed at site 0 .",
    "note that this strong local correlation between the spin up and spin down occupations is not compatible with an itinerant fermionic quasiparticle description , and really requires one to think in terms of a fluctuating spin ( a local moment ) at site @xmath40 .",
    "as the temperature is lowered further in this regime , the nontrivial physics of the kondo effect becomes active at temperatures of order @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a constant of order unity .",
    "notice that this temperature is exponentially small for large @xmath7 , and the temperature range in ( [ lowt ] ) is well defined . at temperatures below @xmath52 the local moment at 0",
    "is quenched by the formation of a spin singlet with an electron drawn from the conduction band .",
    "the local suscepbility therefore eventually returns to that of the pauli susceptibility of a fermi liquid .",
    "notice that as @xmath55 , there is no sharp distinction between cases ( i ) and ( ii ) above : in both cases the spin susceptibility is that of a fermi liquid . nevertheless , there is a significant difference in the intermediate temperature behavior . in the original mean field theory of anderson ( 1961 ) this distinction between the two cases appears as a sharp phase transition , but this is an artifact of the mean - field approximation .",
    "we show in fig  [ fig3 ] the phase diagram of the single impurity model as determined by the generalization of the anderson ( 1961 ) mean field theory",
    ".    also sketched are the behaviors of @xmath45 outlined above .",
    "it is also useful to notice the analogy between the features noted above and the fluctuations which lead to the quantum griffiths singularities in random spin systems ( fisher 1992 , 1995 ; thill & huse 1995 ; read _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; guo _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; senthil & sachdev 1996 ) . in the latter cases the important random fluctuations are in localized regions",
    "in which the quantum spin correlations have their values enhanced by some finite fraction .",
    "as above , the contribution of any single such region is eventually quenched by its quantum coupling to the surrounding spins .",
    "the true importance of the local random fluctuations , and the qualitative difference they make to the macroscopic properties , only becomes apparent when the collective statistics of the global system is examined .",
    "we will turn to this in the following subsection .",
    "now we turn to the full complexity of @xmath10 , allowing the configuration of every site to be random .",
    "we anticipate that quantum griffiths effects noted above could have an important influence here , but before we can apply such arguments , more elementary issues need to be settled : ( _ i _ ) do the single impurity instabilities discussed above apply to the fully random case , in which every site is potentially an impurity site ?",
    "( _ ii _ ) what is the spatial extent of each local moment instability ?",
    "in particular , is it correlated with the localization length of the itinerant quasiparticles ?",
    "( _ iii _ ) is it valid to treat the different instabilities independently of each other ?",
    "although the possibile importance of local moments to disordered metals had been noted earlier ( quirt & marko 1971 ; ue & maekawa 1971 ; alloul & dellouve 1987 ; sachdev 1989 ) , these questions were first addressed by milovanovic _",
    "( 1989 ) , and we review their results below .    first , notice that the distinction between the two regimes of the single impurity model became apparent at a relatively high temperature @xmath50 .",
    "the same feature is expected to hold in the fully disordered model , and we will therefore treat the interactions in @xmath10 within the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "it is essential , however , to include the effects of disorder exactly : this approach is therefore the converse of the method used to describe the disordered itinerant quasiparticles ( altshuler & aronov 1983 ; finkelstein 1983 , 1984 ; castellani & dicastro 1985 ; belitz & kirkpatrick 1994 ) . a useful way to formulate the hartree - fock or ` self - consistent field ' approach is to consider it as the optimization of a single - particle effective hamiltonian @xmath56 .",
    "we choose this in the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the variational parameters .",
    "notice that the @xmath59 are local magnetic fields which polarize the electrons on site @xmath2 .",
    "the appearance of a significant @xmath59 on a given site is the signal of a formation of a local moment , and the spatial form of the @xmath59 field therefore contains the essential information that we want .",
    "as we are mainly discussing the issue of the initial instability towards the formation of local moments , it is useful to expand the effective free energy in powers of the @xmath59 .",
    "the results of such an expansion are @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the free energy of the unpolarized state with @xmath62 .",
    "the quantity @xmath63 is the spin susceptibility matrix of this unpolarized state it is the response in the magnetization at site @xmath2 to a magnetic field at site @xmath64 .",
    "more specifically , it is defined by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the fermi function , @xmath67 are the wavefunctions of the itinerant quasiparticles in the unpolarized state , and @xmath68 are their energies . in the present effective field approximation",
    "these are the eigenvalues and eigenenergies of a one - particle hamiltonian @xmath69 \\psi_{\\alpha } ( j ) = \\lambda_{\\alpha } \\psi_{\\alpha } ( i ) .",
    "\\label{psi}\\ ] ] finally , the parameters @xmath58 are determined by the nonlinear self - consistency condition @xmath70 the equations ( [ psi ] ) and ( [ epsilon ] ) were solved numerically for realistic realizations of the disorder appropriate to @xmath71 .",
    "the density of the disorder was chosen so that the system is comfortably within the metallic phase .",
    "the quasiparticle wavefunctions , @xmath72 , are extended for a wide range of energies near the fermi level , and explicit evidence is presented for this below . from the known @xmath72 and @xmath68 , the susceptibility matrix @xmath63 was determined from ( [ defchi ] ) .    to proceed further , is is useful to now diagonalize @xmath63 .",
    "we solve the eigenvalue problem @xmath73 where @xmath74 are the eigenvalues , and @xmath75 are the normalized eigenvectors . now make the expansion @xmath76 and insert it into ( [ freeen ] ) .",
    "we get @xmath77 we see that there is first an instability to a non - zero value of @xmath78 if the associated eigenvalue @xmath79 .",
    "we identify the temperature at which this first happens with the formation of a local moment with spatial distribution of spin proportional to @xmath80 .",
    "what now happens at lower temperatures depends upon the spatial structure of @xmath81 . if all of the instabilities appear in _ localized",
    "_ eigenvectors @xmath81 which are spatially well separated from each other , then they are approximately decoupled , and we can identify the formation of each of those local moments at the point where their respective @xmath79 . on the other hand ,",
    "if any of the @xmath81 are extended , then we have to go into the magnetized phase with @xmath82 , recompute the new susceptibility matrix , and diagonalize it again .",
    "the latter possibility in fact corresponds to the appearance of the long - range order of the metallic spin glass phase , and will be discussed in section  [ msg ] . in the present circumstances we found that all the @xmath75 were indeed well localized .",
    "evidence for the localization is presented in fig  [ fig4 ] .",
    "= 4.5 in    there we compare the values of the inverse participation ratios @xmath83 and @xmath84 which are defined by @xmath85 the eigenstates @xmath86 and @xmath81 are both normalized , and so @xmath87 are measures of their average spatial extent .",
    "if the states are localized then @xmath87 will saturate to some finite value of order unity as the system size is increased ; on the other hand , if the states are extended , we expect @xmath87 to roughly decrease as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the number of sites .",
    "we see from fig  [ fig4 ] that the behavior of the two participation ratios is dramatically different .",
    "the quasiparticle wavefunctions @xmath67 are clearly extended , as has been previously claimed .",
    "for the same samples , however , the @xmath81 are well localized , on the scale of just one or two sites ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the localization of the @xmath91 is the key result of the numerical analysis of milovanovic _ et al . _",
    "it answers the questions posed at the beginning of this subsection .",
    "this localization justifies the identification of the instabilities in the fully random @xmath10 and @xmath56 with essentially independent instabilities , much like those in the single impurity model .",
    "the local moments are confined to just a few sites , and this localization is quite independent of the localization length of the quasiparticles , which are in fact itinerant .",
    "the initial instabilities at different points in the sample are essentially decoupled as they correspond to different localized eigenvectors of @xmath63 with little mutual overlap .",
    "all of these features are again consistent with their interpretation as griffiths effects which require rare , _ independent _ , fluctuations in different regions of the sample .",
    "all griffiths effects are precursors of some actual phase transition , the proper identification of which requires some understanding of lower temperature properties of the local moments , which we address in the next section .",
    "once the local moments have formed at temperatures @xmath50 , a different effective hamiltonian for the low temperature properties of the metal is clearly warranted . on the local moment sites ,",
    "states with two spin singlet electrons , or with no electrons , occur only with a small probability , and it will clearly pay to eliminate them by a canonical transformation .",
    "let us denote that sites upon which we want to perform this canonical transformation by @xmath92 .",
    "then on each such site @xmath92 we have only two allowed states : a spin up electron or a spin down electron , and a quantum spin-@xmath93 operator @xmath94 which transforms among them .",
    "we have assumed above that the local moment resides on a single site .",
    "it is clearly possible to have moments located on two or more sites , but we expect that a similar procedure can be applied",
    ". a higher spin-@xmath64 operator might be required , and more states may have to be eliminated , but these complications are not expected to modify any of the following discussion .    we can now write down an effective hamiltonian for the entire random system @xmath95 the primes on the sums indicate that the sites @xmath92 have to be excluded from the sum over @xmath2 . the new feature is the kondo exchange coupling , @xmath96 ( expected to be antiferromagnetic ) between the local moments and the itinerant electrons , and",
    "this is the remnant of the canonical transformation eliminating the states on the local moment sites .",
    "the low temperature properties of random models like @xmath97 have been considered by a number of investigators ( bhatt & fisher 1992 ; dobrosavljevic _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; dobrosavljevic & kotliar 1993 ; tusch & logan 1993 , 1995 ; lakner _ et al .",

    "_ 1995 ; miranda _ et al .",
    "_ 1996,1997 )    we will focus here on the elegant results of lakner _",
    "( 1994 ) and langenfeld & wolfle ( 1995 ) which have the virtue of containing _ quantitative _ predictions specific to @xmath71 .",
    "they began with a quantitative computation of the boundary between the single impurity local moment and itinerant quasiparticle regimes in environments characteristic of those found in @xmath71 . assuming that the location of the @xmath98 sites in @xmath71 were statistically uncorrelated , they computed the probability distributions of the local environments of the sites . the combination of these results allowed to predict two quantities essential for a quantitative comparison with experimental results ( _ i _ ) the density of local moments as a function of @xmath98 doping , and ( _ ii _ ) the probability distribution of the kondo temperatures @xmath99 of these local moment sites . over a broad range of @xmath52 values , including the entire experimentally relevant range , they found that @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a normalization constant , and @xmath102 . if one now ignores the possible exchange couplings between the local moments ( these could be mediated by the itinerant quasiparticles , or due to a direct exchange ) , the local moment contribution to thermodynamic properties can be computed by a simple superposition of the universal single impurity thermodynamics at different kondo temperatures .",
    "such a procedure gives a specific heat @xmath103 and a uniform spin susceptibility @xmath104 .",
    "( 1994 ) find good quantitative agreement between such model calculations and experimental measurements of the specific heat .",
    "the singular low temperature effects of the local moments above are clearly associated with those sites at which @xmath52 is anomalously small .",
    "the local spin orientation on those sites has a long lifetime , and under these conditions any rkky coupling between them will clearly be important , although it has been neglected in the above analyses .",
    "indeed this rkky coupling will prefer a fixed relative orientation among the slowly fluctuating moments . as the rkky coupling is an oscillating function of separation",
    ", the relative orientation will oscillate in sign .",
    "taking the limit over which this rkky coupling correlates an increasingly larger number of local moments , we see that eventually spin glass order will appear . none of this incipient ordering has directly involved the itinerant quasiparticles , and so the system will remain metallic . these arguments clearly show that the griffiths effects associated with local moment formation are precursors of the metallic spin glass phase .",
    "we now turn to an analysis of the metallic spin glass ( msg ) , with a particular focus on its transition to the metallic phase ( mqp ) and the crossovers at finite temperature in the vicinity of the quantum critical point .",
    "this analysis will be done within the framework of a landau theory for this transition that was developed recently ( read _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; sachdev _ et al .",
    "such analysis effectively focuses only on the extended eigenmodes of the susceptibility @xmath63 into which there is condensation in the spin glass phase .",
    "the quantum griffiths effects that were crucial to understanding the low temperature properties of the mqp are entirely missing at the mean field level .",
    "omission of these griffiths effects is probably quite dangerous at low temperatures .",
    "however , we shall find new regimes at moderate temperatures which display novel physics associated with the extended states of the critical point , and the analysis below should be considered a first attempt towards their understanding .",

    "we shall take a landau theory point of view in this article , and hence automatically obtain a formalism which is suited for analysis of fluctuations ( sachdev _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; sachdev & read 1996 ) .",
    "however it is also possibly to obtain results equivalent to those of the landau mean field theory by the exact solution of an infinite - range model : such an approach was followed by sengupta & georges ( 1995 ) ( and also for related models by huse & miller ( 1993 ) and ye _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) ) , but we shall not use it here .    in the following subsections we will ( _ i _ ) introduce the order parameter for quantum spin glass to paramagnet transition , ( _ ii _ ) obtain a landau functional for this order parameter , ( _ iii _ ) minimize the functional as a function of temperature and coupling constant to obtain the predictions of crossover functions , and ( _ iv _ ) briefly discuss the relationship to recent experiments on heavy fermion compounds .",
    "we begin by introducing the order parameter for the quantum phase transition ( read _ et al .",
    "recall that for classical spin glasses in the replica formalism , this is a matrix @xmath105 , @xmath106 are replica indices and @xmath107 .",
    "the components of @xmath105 can be related to the edwards - anderson order parameter , @xmath108 , in a somewhat subtle way we wo nt go into here ( fischer & hertz 1991 ; binder & young 1986 ) . in quantum ( @xmath12 ) phase transitions , time dependent fluctuations of the order parameter must be considered ( in `` imaginary '' matsubara time @xmath109 ) , and in the spin glass case it is found that the standard decoupling , analogous to the classical case introducing @xmath105 , leads now to a matrix function of two times ( bray & moore 1980 ) which we can consider to be @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a coarse - graining region in the neighborhood of @xmath112 , and we will henceforth omit the vector spin indices on all operators except where necessary . from the set - up of the replica formalism it is clear that @xmath113 relating @xmath108 to the replica components of @xmath114",
    "we have introduced above double angular brackets to represent averages taken with the translationally invariant replica action ( recall that single angular brackets represent thermal / quantum averages for a fixed realization of randomness , and overlines represent averages over randomness ) .",
    "notice that the fluctuating field @xmath114 is in general a function of two separate times @xmath115 and @xmath116 ; however the expectation value of its replica diagonal components can only be a function of the time difference @xmath117 .",
    "further , the expectation value of the replica off - diagonal components of @xmath114 is independent of both @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( ye _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) , and has a structure very similar to that of the classical order parameter @xmath105 .",
    "one can therefore also obtain @xmath108 from the replica off - diagonal components of @xmath114 , as noted above for @xmath105 .",
    "let us also note for completeness that , unlike the quantum case , the replica diagonal components of the classical order parameter @xmath105 are usually constrained to be unity , and contain no useful information .",
    "the order parameter we shall use is @xmath118 , which is a matrix in a replica space and depends on the spatial co - ordinate @xmath112 and two times @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",
    "however , a little thought shows that this function contains too much information .",
    "the important degrees of freedom , for which one can hope to make general and universal statements , are the long - time spin correlations with @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is a microscopic time like an inverse of a typical exchange constant . as presented , the function @xmath114 contains information not only on the interesting long - time correlations , but also on the uninteresting time range with @xmath121 smaller than or of order @xmath120 .",
    "the correlations in the latter range are surely model - dependent and can not be part of any general landau action .",
    "we shall separate out this uninteresting part of @xmath114 by performing the shift @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a constant , and the delta function @xmath124 is a schematic for a function which decays rapidly to zero on a scale @xmath120 .",
    "the value of @xmath123 will be adjusted so that the resulting @xmath114 contains only the interesting long time physics : we will see later how this can be done in a relatively straightforward manner .",
    "the alert reader may recognize some similarity between the above procedure , and the analysis of fisher ( 1978 ) of the yang - lee edge problem . in that case , too , the order parameter contains an uninteresting non - critical piece which has to be shifted away ; we will see below that there many other similarities between the yang - lee edge and quantum spin glass problems .",
    "the action functional can be derived by explicit computations on microscopic models or deduced directly from general arguments which have been discussed in some detail by read _",
    "apart from a single non - local term present in the metallic case ( sachdev _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) ( see below ) , the remaining important terms are consistent with the general criteria that :    1 .",
    "the action is an integral over space of a local operator which can be expanded in gradients of powers of @xmath114 evaluated at the same position @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath114 is bilocal ( _ i.e. _  is a matrix ) in time , and each time is associated with one of the two replica indices ( see definition eqn ( [ composite ] ) ) .",
    "these `` indices '' can appear more than once in a term and are summed over freely subject to the following rules before summations : 1 .",
    "each distinct replica index appears an even number of times .",
    "2 .   repetition of a time `` index '' corresponds to quantum - mechanical interaction of spins , which must be local in time and accordingly can be expanded as terms with times set equal plus the same with additional derivatives ; it occurs when the corresponding replica indices are the same , and only then .",
    "we now present all the terms , which , a subsequent renormalization - group analysis tells us are important near the quantum critical point .",
    "this is only a small subset of the terms allowed by the above criteria .",
    "a crucial term is that linear in the order parameter @xmath114 .",
    "this term encodes the local , on - site physics of the spin glass model , and tells us the that spin is coupled to a metallic bath of itinerant quasiparticles . @xmath125",
    "the coupling @xmath126 will be seen below to be the critical tuning parameter for the transition from the spin glass to the paramagnet .",
    "there is an overall factor of @xmath127 in front of this term ; we have written this factor as a product of two coupling constants , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , for technical reasons we shall not discuss here .",
    "there is a quadratic gradient term @xmath130 ^ 2 \\label{actione3}\\ ] ] which is responsible for the development of spatial correlations in the spin glass order .",
    "a quadratic term without gradients @xmath131 ^ 2 \\label{actione4}\\ ] ] is also allowed by the general criteria , but we choose to tune its coefficient to zero by using the freedom in ( [ repar ] ) . as will become clear in the next subsection , this criterion is identical to requiring the absence of uninteresting short time behavior in @xmath114 .",
    "notice again the formal similarity to the theory of the yang - lee edge ( fisher 1978 ) , where setting the coefficient of a quadratic term to zero was also responsible for removing the uninteresting non - critical part of the order parameter variable .",
    "next we consider cubic non - linearities , and the most important among the several allowed terms is the one with the maximum number of different time and replica indices : @xmath132 this term accounts for non - linearities induced solely by disorder fluctuations .",
    "of the terms with fewer than the maximum allowed number of time indices at a given order , the most important one is the one at quadratic order : @xmath133 the coupling @xmath134 is the only one responsible for quantum mechanical interactions between the spins , and as a consequence , all the time and replica indices in ( [ actione6 ] ) are the same .",
    "lastly we have a final quadratic term @xmath135 which accounts for the spatial fluctuation in the position of the paramagnet - spin glass transition .",
    "recall that the linear coupling @xmath126 was the control parameter for this transition , and a term like ( [ actione7 ] ) is obtained by allowing for gaussian fluctuations in @xmath126 , about its mean value , from point to point in space .",
    "it will turn out that ( [ actione7 ] ) plays no role in the mean - field analysis in the following subsection .",
    "however , it is essential to include ( [ actione7 ] ) for a proper theory of the fluctuations .",
    "the final landau theory of the metallic spin glass and its transition to the metal is then ( [ actione2 ] ) + ( [ actione3 ] ) + ( [ actione4 ] ) + ( [ actione5 ] ) + ( [ actione6 ] ) + ( [ actione7 ] ) .",
    "we will now minimize the action of section  [ action ] .",
    "we will review the mean field theory for the mqp phase and identify the position of its instability to the msg phase .",
    "a discussion of the solution within the msg phase will not be presented here .",
    "we fourier transform from imaginary time to matsubara frequencies by expressing the action in terms of @xmath136 where we are using units in which @xmath137 , and the frequencies , @xmath138 , @xmath139 are quantized in integer multiples of @xmath140 .",
    "then , we make an ansatz for the mean - field value of @xmath114 which is @xmath112-independent , and dependent only on @xmath117 ; within the mqp phase this takes the form @xmath141 where we have used ( [ defqea ] ) to identify the right hand side as the local dynamic susceptibility . inserting ( [ mft2 ] ) into the action for the metallic case in section  [ action ] , we get for the free energy per unit volume @xmath142 ( as usual , @xmath142 represents the physical disorder averaged free energy ) : @xmath143 + \\frac{u}{2 t } \\left [ t \\sum_{\\omega } \\chi_l ( i \\omega ) \\right]^2 \\label{mft3}\\ ] ] notice that the coupling @xmath144 appears only as a prefactor in front of the total free energy , as the contribution of the @xmath145 term ( [ actione7 ] ) vanishes in the replica limit @xmath107 .",
    "the value of @xmath129 will therefore play no role in the mean field theory .",
    "we now determine the saddle point of ( [ mft3 ] ) with respect to variations in the whole function @xmath146 , and find the solution @xmath147 where the energy scale @xmath148 is determined by the solution of the equation @xmath149 taking the imaginary part of the analytic continuation of ( [ mft4 ] ) to real frequencies , we get @xmath150 inserting the solution for @xmath39 back into ( [ mft3 ] ) , and using ( [ mft5 ] ) , we get for the free energy density : @xmath151 \\label{mft5a}\\ ] ] the equations ( [ mft5 ] ) , ( [ cross2 ] ) , ( [ mft5a ] ) are key results ( sachdev _ et al .",

    "these results contain a great deal of structure , and a fairly careful and non - trivial analysis is required to extract the universal information contained within them .",

    "clearly the system is in the msg phase for @xmath12 , @xmath153 , and a separate ansatz for @xmath114 is necessary there , as discussed elsewhere ( sachdev _ et al .",
    "let us now define @xmath156 so that the quantum critical point is at @xmath12 , @xmath157 . in the vicinity of this point",
    ", our action constitutes a continuum quantum field theory ( cqft ) describing the physics of the system at all energy scales significantly smaller than @xmath155 .",
