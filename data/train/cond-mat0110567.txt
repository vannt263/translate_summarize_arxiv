    "the description of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) growth @xcite has become important due to the need to understand the physics of atom lasers @xcite .",
    "these recently developed devices which emit coherent wave - like beams of atoms promise a new generation of precision measurements , applications in nanotechnology and novel tests of fundamental concepts in quantum theory .",
    "while it is possible to perform first - principles numerical simulations of the relevant equations @xcite , a great deal of physical insight can be obtained from an analytic solution .    in this paper , we give an analytic asymptotic solution to the gross - pitaevskii equation describing the early stages of condensate growth in a trap . the physical insight we obtain from this is that a growing non - equilibrium condensate has a non - uniform momentum distribution across the condensed region . as a result",
    ", the observed density behaves as though the trap frequency is increased , relative to the usual thomas - fermi behavior @xcite of an equilibrium bec . in addition , our solutions show center - of - mass oscillations whose kinetic energy is amplified with the condensate growth .",
    "this implies that , while bec s formed through evaporative cooling may have a low temperature for their internal degrees of freedom , the temperature for the center - of - mass motion is higher , leading to increased noise in the velocity and direction of atom laser beams .",
    "we start by considering a commonly used model of a one - component trapped bose - einstein condensate - the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation modified by a linear gain term @xmath1 @xcite , of the form : @xmath2 \\psi \\ , .",
    "\\label{gp - gain}\\ ] ] here @xmath3 is the mean - field amplitude ( so that @xmath4 is the particle number density ) , @xmath5 is the atomic mass , and @xmath6 is the effective interaction potential . in the treatment of @xmath7 or @xmath8 space dimensions ,",
    "@xmath6 is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the scattering length and @xmath11 is the confinement length .",
    "the potential term @xmath12 is due to an optical or magnetic trap , which we assume is harmonic . in the simplest rotationally symmetric case ,",
    "the trap potential is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the trap oscillation frequency .",
    "it is helpful to understand the physical implications of eq .",
    "( [ gp - gain ] ) by an analysis of the relevant time scales . in the present case",
    ", there are three different relevant time - scales .",
    "these are : the time - scale for the condensate growth , @xmath15 , the trap oscillation time - scale , @xmath16 , and the `` healing '' time - scale , @xmath17 , associated with the mean - field interaction potential at the condensate center - of - mass @xmath18 .",
    "since current bec s typically have a relatively high density , the healing time is usually the smallest , which results in a thomas - fermi ( tf ) type equilibrium condensate .",
    "if the gain time - scale is long enough , then one may expect that even during growth , the condensate will adiabatically follow the tf solution .",
    "this is commonly assumed in analyzing experimental data @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the gain time - scale is shorter than the trap oscillation period , in which case we should no longer expect adiabatic tf like behavior .      to show this distinction",
    ", we now proceed to give an analytic non - equilibrium solution of the gp equation with gain .",
    "firstly , we expand the field in terms of the amplitude and phase , @xmath19 and obtain the following coupled equations : @xmath20    next , we wish to investigate possible asymptotic solutions for long times ",
    "i.e. , steadily growing solutions , valid some time after initial nucleation of the condensate , yet before any gain saturation has occurred .",
    "we consider first the rotationally symmetric case , where @xmath21\\partial _ { r}$ ] , with @xmath22 . following the construction",
    "successfully used recently in optical fiber environments @xcite  and extending these to the current multi - dimensional case of a trapped bec  we suppose that the amplitude has a self - similar behavior at large time .",
    "the phase is assumed to depend on the atomic density at the condensate center , and to have a uniform chirp giving a radially dependent outward momentum .",
    "thus , we seek a solution in the form of : @xmath23 here @xmath24 is a scaling function , while @xmath25 and @xmath26 are unknown coefficients . using this construction , we find , from eqs .",
    "( [ dela / delt ] ) and ( [ delphi / delt ] ) : @xmath27 @xmath28 where we have defined @xmath29 .",
    "from the first ( amplitude ) equation , the solution requires the twin conditions that : @xmath30 this implies that the scaling function @xmath31 grows exponentially with time , having a solution of @xmath32 , where we can immediately solve for the growth rate , since clearly @xmath33 .",
    "the physical interpretation of this equation is rather straightforward ; the growth of the amplitude at any radial point is reduced below the single - mode growth rate @xmath1 , due to an outward flow of atoms , which transfers part of the increased density to a larger radius .",
    "this effect increases with dimensionality of the space .",
    "the phase equation can now be simplified using the fact that the last two terms involving derivatives have terms in @xmath34 , and hence become exponentially smaller than the earlier terms , at long times , as the healing time becomes smaller .",
    "this immediately gives the following solution for @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the maximum radius given by : @xmath38    the remaining unknown constant @xmath25 is obtained by evaluating the integral @xmath39 for the total number of particles : @xmath40 here @xmath41 is a dimension - dependent constant , with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "this gives the expected result that the overall atom number grows exponentially with a gain constant of @xmath45 ; that is , @xmath46 .",
    "the reason for this apparent difference in gain constants is that the relatively slower growth in density at the center of the condensate is exactly compensated for by the increase in condensate radius with time .",
    "the constant @xmath25 is solved in terms of @xmath47 , so that : @xmath48 ^{2/(d+2)}.   \\label{alpha}\\ ] ] this coincides with the healing time for a condensate with atom number @xmath47 , in tf equilibrium  but with an effective trap oscillation frequency @xmath49 instead of @xmath14 .    the final result for the particle number density @xmath50 is : @xmath51    in equilibrium tf solutions , there is a similar behavior , except that there is no outward momentum term . as a consequence ,",
    "the tf radius ( @xmath52 ) is always larger at a given total atom number , and the density is lower at the center , than in these non - equilibrium solutions with gain present .",
    "the physical reason for this is simply the rapid bose - enhanced increase in number density ( and hence pressure ) at the condensate center during the nucleation process .",
    "this effect becomes appreciable when @xmath53 , or @xmath54 , so that the time - scale for condensate growth is faster than the trap oscillation period .",
    "we now turn to comparisons between the analytic asymptotic solution and exact numerical results . in fig .",
    "1 we plot the r.m.s .",
    "radius @xmath55 of a growing bec versus @xmath56 .",
    "the result found from the above asymptotic solution in @xmath57 is simply given by @xmath58 .",
    "this is represented by the dashed line , for @xmath59 and @xmath60 . for comparison , the tf r.m.s .",
    "radius for the same values of @xmath61 is represented by the dotted line .",
    "the full lines correspond to the results of direct numerical simulations of the gp equation with gain , with initial gaussian wave functions of different widths .",
    "the values of other parameters are chosen to correspond to a @xmath62rb bec ( @xmath63 kg , @xmath64 m@xmath65/s ) in a trap with @xmath66 hz .",
    "as one can see from the graph , despite the initial differences , the mean radii approach the same asymptotic value of @xmath67 , which is different to the tf result for the same total number of particles .",
    "the outward momentum density @xmath68(where @xmath69/2 $ ] ) is plotted in fig .",
    "2 , showing that in a growing bec the flow of atoms from the trap centre increases initially with the distance , reaches a maximum , and vanishes at @xmath70 .",
    "the above rotationally symmetric results can easily be generalized to asymmetric cases , where the trap oscillation frequencies @xmath71 in each space direction are different . in this case , the trap potential term in eqs .",
    "( [ gp - gain ] ) and ( [ delphi / delt ] ) is replaced by @xmath72    assuming again that the amplitude has a self - similar behavior at long times , one can use the previous construction .",
    "in addition , we find that a further more general solution can be obtained . following the approach of kohn s theorem @xcite , generalized to include gain ,",
    "we allow for center - of - mass oscillation of the growing condensate , independent of the inter - particle interactions .",
    "thus , we seek a solution in the form of @xmath73 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the center - of - mass , and the dot stands for the time derivative .    using the same procedure as before , we first find  from the amplitude equation  that the function @xmath24 is given by @xmath76 where @xmath33 , as previously .    to treat the phase equation , in which we neglect the last term @xmath77 that becomes exponentially small at long times , we assume that @xmath78 where the functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 are to be found by equating the terms in powers of @xmath81 . from the terms in @xmath81",
    ", we find that each component of @xmath75 satisfies equation @xmath82 , so that the condensate center - of - mass oscillates according to @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the initial amplitude and phase .    by equating the terms in @xmath86 and the zeroth - order terms ,",
    "respectively , we obtain an equation for @xmath87 , @xmath88 = 0,\\ ] ] as well as solutions to @xmath79 and @xmath80 : @xmath89 @xmath90    combining these together and using the solutions for the center - of - mass coordinates , we finally obtain that the solution for the function @xmath91 is given by @xmath92 while the solution for @xmath35 is @xmath93 in the region of space where the expression in large brackets is positive , and @xmath94 outside that region .",
    "the maximum radius @xmath95 in each space direction is @xmath96 where we have introduced @xmath97 .",
    "in addition , the constant @xmath25 is solved , as previously , in terms of @xmath47 by evaluating the integral for the total number of particles @xmath46 . the resulting expression for @xmath25",
    "is given by the same equation as before , eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) , except that @xmath98 is replaced by @xmath99 .",
    "this again corresponds to the healing time in a tf condensate , with @xmath47 particles and effective trap oscillation frequencies @xmath100 .",
    "the final result for the particle number density is now : @xmath101 an example showing growth of the bec , while the condensate center - of - mass oscillates , is shown in fig .",
    "the physical interpretation of these results is that the asymptotic solution with gain has a density distribution that is similar to the tf solution , except that the trap oscillation effective frequency is increased , with @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 . for a given gain",
    "constant , this has the strongest effect for weakly trapped ( low - frequency ) directions , in an asymmetric trap . in addition , the solution gives an outward momentum component due to bosonic stimulation effect which is stronger in the center of the trap .",
    "in addition , the results obtained show that bose stimulation can occur to moving condensates as easily as to stationary ones . in cases like this ,",
    "the amplitude of the center - of - mass oscillation does not change during the condensate growth , while the total mass of the condensate increases .",
    "this means that the condensate center - of - mass kinetic energy , @xmath105 , can grow exponentially to large values  even in the absence of technical noise .",
    "while the present model of gain is simplified , similar types of center - of - mass motion are found in first - principles simulations of condensate formation @xcite .",
    "this suggests that , while bec s formed through stimulated emission may have a low temperature relative to the center - of - mass , the center - of - mass motion may itself have a higher temperature .",
    "current experimental measurements of single atom velocity distributions @xcite appear insensitive to the center - of - mass temperature of the condensate .",
    "the effect is analogous to the increased uncertainty in the frequency and pointing stability of a multi - mode optical laser , compared to a single - mode laser .",
    "we emphasize that the asymptotic solutions given here are only applicable for condensate nuclei that have already formed , as the spontaneous emission noise is omitted .",
    "the gain medium is assumed to be unsaturated and to equilibrate rapidly , giving a uniform gain constant across the growing condensate .",
    "in addition , one can expect damping to occur due to interactions with non - condensed atoms @xcite , which are not treated here .",
    "these interactions , however , can only equilibrate the temperatures of condensed and non - condensed center - of - mass motion , rather than providing additional cooling of the condensate center - of - mass motion . other damping mechanisms that will intrinsically be present in a bec are two - body losses , which effectively change @xmath1 to @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the two - body loss rate .",
    "while these affect the form of the asymptotic solution , two - body ( or higher - order ) losses do not change the amplitude of the condensate center - of - mass oscillation    in summary , we have found an asymptotic solution to the gross - pitaevskii equation with gain , which has the advantage of yielding an explicit analytic result of great physical transparency .",
    "the solution shows that the non - equilibrium behavior of a growing bose - einstein condensate generally includes an outward momentum component and spatial oscillations . as a result , we suggest that the state of a trapped bec is not a canonical ensemble , and should be characterized by at least two distinct temperatures : one for the internal degrees of freedom , and one for the center - of - mass motion .",
