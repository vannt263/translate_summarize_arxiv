    "an international collaboration is proposing@xcite to revive the experimental program at the fermilab antiproton accumulator .",
    "we summarize the goals of this effort in the context of other efforts world - wide .",
    "the world s highest - energy and highest - intensity antiproton source is at fermilab . having previously supported medium - energy antiproton fixed - target experiments ( including the charmonium experiments e760 and e835 ) , it is now 100% dedicated to providing luminosity for the tevatron collider . at cern ,",
    "the lear antiproton storage ring was decommissioned in 1996 ; its successor facility , the antiproton decelerator ( ad ) , provides antiproton beams at momenta of 100 and 300mev/@xmath0 , at intensities up to @xmath1 per minute.@xcite these are the only operating facilties .",
    "germany has embarked on a @xmath2billion - euro upgrade for the gsi - darmstadt nuclear - physics laboratory , with planned construction by @xmath22014 of 30 and 90gev rapid - cycling synchrotrons and low- and medium - energy antiproton storage rings.@xcite      many interesting topics can be addressed with such a facility , including    * precision @xmath3charmonium studies , begun by fermilab e760 and e835 ; * open - charm studies , including searches for @xmath4 mixing and _ cp _ violation ; * studies of @xmath3hyperons , including hyperon _",
    "cp _ violation and rare decays ; * the search for glueballs and gluonic hybrid states predicted by qcd ; and * trapped-@xmath5 and antihydrogen studies .",
    "needed beam energy or intensity makes only the last of these possible at the cern ad .",
    "all have been discussed as program components of the gsi - fair ( facility for antiproton and ion research ) project@xcite and its general - purpose panda detector.@xcite however , gsi - fair construction has yet to begin , and panda data taking is not expected before 2014 .",
    "table  [ tab : thresh ] gives some relevant mass and momentum thresholds .",
    "a number of intriguing recent discoveries can be elucidated at such a facility : the states provisionally named @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 in the charmonium region,@xcite as well as the observation of apparent flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) in hyperon decay;@xcite indeed , high sensitivity can be achieved to symmetry - violating or rare hyperon decays generally .",
    "in addition , the @xmath11 mass and width , @xmath12 radiative - decay angular distributions , and @xmath13 full and radiative widths , important parameters of the charmonium system that remain to be precisely determined , are well suited to the @xmath14 technique.@xcite      heavy - quark  antiquark bound states (  quarkonia \" ) offer a unique testing ground for qcd .",
    "both potential models and lattice - gauge monte carlo successfully predict aspects of heavy - quark systems .",
    "quenched - approximation lattice - qcd predictions of the masses of low - lying charmonium states agree qualitatively with the experimental values;@xcite this agreement is expected to improve once dynamical quarks on the lattice ( now being implemented by various groups ) are successfully incorporated.@xcite charmonium ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ccbar ] ) is an important proving ground for qcd : the @xmath0 and @xmath15 quarks are slow enough that relativistic effects are significant but not dominant , and are sufficiently massive that non - perturbative effects are small but not negligible .",
    "once certified by experiment , these calculational techniques can then be confidently applied in interpreting such physics results as _ cp _ asymmetries in the beauty system .",
    "fermilab experiments e760 and e835 made the world s most precise measurements of charmonium masses and widths.@xcite this precision ( @xmath16100kev ) reflects the narrow energy spread of the stochastically cooled antiproton beam and the absence of fermi motion and negligible energy loss in hydrogen cluster - jet targets .",
    "the other key advantage of @xmath14 annihilation is its ability to produce charmonium states of all quantum numbers , whereas @xmath17 machines produce primarily @xmath18 states .",
    "we are proposing a focused experimental program aimed at those measurements for which the antiproton source is best suited : ( 1 ) precision studies of states in the charmonium region and ( 2 ) the search for new physics in hyperon decay .",
    "these measurements can be performed with a common apparatus using existing technologies .",
    "depending on available resources , existing detector components might be recycled for these purposes ; alternatively , modest expenditures for new equipment could yield improved performance .",
    "the opportunity for such studies will soon arrive , with the planned 2009 shutdown of the tevatron . the importance of these measurements justifies the resumption of such a program at fermilab .",
    "the antiproton source maximum stacking rate is now @xmath220ma / hr ( or @xmath19/hr ) , five times that in e835.@xcite we propose to run with up to ten times the typical e835 luminosity@xcite ( @xmath20 ) , via increased store intensity or target density .",
    "since stochastic cooling works best with small stacks , more intense stores seem nonoptimal .",
    "the e835 cluster - jet target ( an upgrade of the e760 one ) produced@xcite up to @xmath21atoms/@xmath22 .",
    "higher cluster - jet density is proposed for the panda program ( also planned for @xmath23).@xcite other options include a plastic or metal wire or pellet in the beam halo,@xcite a solid - h@xmath24 target on the tip of a cold finger , or a stream of h@xmath24 pellets . a non - h@xmath24 target , while suitable for hyperon running , would destroy the superb energy resolution needed for the charmonium studies .",
    "we favor simultaneous charmonium and hyperon running with an h@xmath24 target .",
    "to clarify issues for a future antiproton facility , we consider representative physics examples : studying the @xmath6 , improved measurement of the parameters of the @xmath11 , searching for hyperon @xmath25 violation , and studying a recently discovered rare hyperon - decay mode .",

    "the coincidence of the @xmath6 with @xmath44 threshold suggests various solutions to this puzzle , including an @xmath45-wave cusp@xcite or a tetraquark state.@xcite an intriguing possibility is that the @xmath6 represents the first clear - cut observation of a meson - antimeson molecule : a bound state of @xmath46.@xcite a @xmath47-gluon hybrid state ; however , the mass and 1@xmath48 quantum numbers make it a poor match to lattice - qcd predictions for such states.@xcite ] a key measurement is the precise mass difference between the @xmath49 and that threshold , which should be slightly negative , in accord with the small molecular binding energy:@xcite @xmath50 a measurement of the width is also highly desirable .    with the latest cleo measurement,@xcite @xmath51mev/@xmath42 , and the world - average@xcite @xmath52mev/@xmath42 , we have @xmath53mev/@xmath42 , with the uncertainty dominated by that of @xmath54 .",

    "sensitivity will be competitive even with that of the proposed superkekb upgrade,@xcite should that project go forward . ]    given the uncertainties in the cross section and branching ratios , the above may well be an under- or overestimate of the @xmath70 formation and observation rates , perhaps by as much as an order of magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that a new experiment at the antiproton accumulator could obtain the world s largest clean samples of @xmath6 , in perhaps as little as a month of running .",
    "the high statistics , event cleanliness , and unique precision available in the @xmath14 formation technique could enable the world s smallest systematics . such an experiment could thus provide a definitive test of the nature of the @xmath6 .      observing the @xmath11@xmath71 charmonium state and measuring",
    "its parameters were high - priority goals of e760 , e835 , and their predecessor experiment , cern r704 .",
    "as a narrow state with suppressed couplings both to @xmath17 and to the states that are easily produced in @xmath17 annihilation , the @xmath11 is a difficult state to study experimentally .",
    "the pioneering charmonium experiment r704 was one of the last experiments at the intersecting storage rings ( isr ) .",
    "with a stochastically cooled @xmath72 beam , a hydrogen cluster - jet target , and a nonmagnetic spectrometer of limited angular coverage , it searched for final states including @xmath73 decay .",
    "a claimed 2.3@xmath74 signal of 5 @xmath75 events near the @xmath12 center of gravity was interpreted as evidence for the ( isospin - violating ) @xmath76 mode , with @xmath11 mass @xmath77mev.@xcite the r704 signal implies an on - resonance cross section of @xmath22nb and @xmath78ev.@xcite    following the isr shutdown , these studies continued with fermilab e760 . also nonmagnetic but with @xmath23@xmath79 coverage , e760 found in a @xmath217pb@xmath80 sample an enhancement in @xmath81 at @xmath82mev,@xcite with a 1-in-400 estimated probability of the 59 candidate events arising at random .",

    "more recently , cleo s study@xcite of @xmath88 has established the existence of the @xmath11 at @xmath894@xmath74 : based on @xmath90 signal events , they find @xmath91mev , not inconsistent with the e835 measurement . neither experiment was able to measure the width of the @xmath11 , but e835 set a 90%-c.l .",
    "upper limit of 1mev .",
    "a key prediction of qcd and perturbation theory is that the charmonium spin - zero hyperfine splitting , as measured by the mass difference @xmath92 between the @xmath11 and the spin - weighted average of the @xmath12 states , should be close to zero.@xcite using the current pdg - average values,@xcite @xmath93mev and @xmath94mev , we find @xmath95mev , nonzero at 2@xmath74 but within the qcd expected range .",
    "the pdg error on @xmath96 includes a scale factor of 1.5 due to the tension among the four most precise measurements ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hc - ideogram ] ) .",
    "moreover , the two most precise ( e760 and e835 ) are based on statistically marginal signals , and the reliability of the e760 result is called into question by the negative results of the e835 search .",
