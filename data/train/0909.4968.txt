    "not only are novel phenomena being routinely observed in wavelength- and sub - wavelength - scale components ,  but these concepts are being rapidly translated into exotic devices for applications ranging from solar energy and information technology , to biology @xcite . at the heart of this development is the ability of nanostructures to confine , guide , and scatter light in ways that are not achievable with bulk materials .",
    "it follows that understanding and improving the performance of these nanostructures requires a detailed knowledge of the electromagnetic modes they support .",
    "the allowed electromagnetic modes in microphotonic structures are determined by solving maxwell s equations for the given geometry .",
    "the last step in this procedure is the application of boundary conditions at the interfaces , yielding the dispersion equations which must be solved to obtain the allowed modes .",
    "these dispersion equations are in general _ transcendental _ and except in a few simple cases , their solutions can not be expressed in terms of elementary mathematical functions .",
    "when the solutions of the dispersion equations are known to be real , they are usually determined using a graphical search algorithm such as the bisection method @xcite . however , in lossy material systems or low index - contrast asymmetric waveguides , the dispersion equations have complex solutions @xcite .",
    "this calls for a search in two dimensions ( i.e. , in the complex plane ) and severely limits the effectiveness of graphical algorithms .",

    "practical implementation of these methods requires careful programming customized for solving the problem at hand . in the methods that rely on curve - fitting , increasing the accuracy beyond a few decimals is often a challenging task , often requiring one to iterate the procedure manually based on previous results",
    "additionally , the root - finding algorithms of several commercial mathematical software suites ( e.g. , mathematica ) can be very sensitive to initial guesses provided by the user ; estimation of this initial guess is especially difficult when the solution is complex .    in this paper",
    ", we present an easy - to - implement iterative procedure for solving complex transcendental dispersion equations that is relatively insensitive to initial guess .",
    "our method applies to rectangular multilayer dielectric and plasmonic waveguides which may have either material or leakage loss .",

    "consider the operation of a 50-nm - thick silver film on a silica substrate at 1550 nm .",
    "the relative permittivities of silver and silica are the same as assumed previously ; the top cover is air ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "we start by specifying @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , and obtain their successive values according to eq .",
    "( [ pw2it ] ) .",
    "the convergence of @xmath120 , and @xmath121 is shown in fig .  [ fig11 ] ; table  [ tab5 ] compares the solution obtained using the iterative scheme with the direct solution computed by the mathematica ` findroot ` function . in our computations , the ` findroot ` function was unable to return the complex mode index unless we gave a very precise initial guess for both the real _ and _ the imaginary parts . on the other hand , the iterative method computed the complex mode index regardless of the initial guess .",
    "our next example is a symmetric structure with a 100-nm silver film sandwiched between two silica layers .",
    "although 100 nm is at the boundary of the film behaving like an dmd waveguide versus two separate interfaces , we choose these dimensions to highlight the robustness of the iterative technique even for the most extreme cases of root - finding . for this structure , both high- and low - energy modes exist , whose indices are conveniently calculated by using the @xmath42 and @xmath41 signs , respectively , in eq .",
    "( [ pw2it ] ) .",
    "the indices calculated using the iterative method and mathematica for this example are included in table  [ tab5 ] and show good agreement . calculating these indices",
    "was especially difficult using ` findroot ` because of their close numerical proximity .",
    "the iterative technique , on the other hand , specifies separate functions ( the @xmath41 and@xmath42 signs ) which are guaranteed to converge to these different modes , irrespective of their numerical proximity .",
    "symmetric dmd waveguides appear in the form of idealized waveguide geometries such as metal films in homogenous dielectric media ( including air ) .",
    "fortunately , for the symmetric case , the iterative scheme consists of a single equation which can be written as :    [ simi ] @xmath122    these equations do not follow automatically from eq .",

    ", , , and .",
    "in addition to the programming ease , the iterative technique has an inherent ability to give arbitrary - precision answers  a feat difficult to achieve using graphical or curve - fitting algorithms such as the reflection - pole method .",
