    "an interest to the behavior of shortest networks under deformations of their boundary sets goes back to the works devoted to steiner ratio of euclidean plane investigations . in 90th , in australian school , some non - trivial estimates on the steiner ratio for small boundary sets were obtained by means of so - called variational approach , i.e. , using a control on behavior of the length functions of minimal spanning tree and shortest tree under small deformations of a boundary set ( which are sometimes referred as variations ) , see  @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "investigation of the length functions of extreme networks were continued by the authors . in paper  @xcite , for shortest trees and for minimal spanning trees in the euclidean space",
    "it is proved an existence of the derivative of their length functions with respect to one - parametrical deformations of the boundary sets , and formulas for those derivatives were derived .",
    "namely , it turns out that the derivative is equal to the derivative of some minimal parametric tree ( a tree with a fixed combinatorial structure ) which is a shortest one ( a minimal spanning one , respectively ) for the initial boundary .",
    "but it is not true that for a sufficiently small deformation of the boundary a structure of shortest tree or of minimal spanning tree can be chosen changeless .",
    "a corresponding example can be easily constructed even for a three - point boundary set in the euclidean plane , see figure  [ fig : examp ] .",
    "one fixed vertex @xmath0 of the triangle is located in the origin , the other fixed vertex @xmath1 belongs to the ray forming the angle of @xmath2 with the abscissa axis , and the third vertex @xmath3 is located at the abscissa axis in the initial time and moves along an oscillating curve which makes infinitely many oscillations around the abscissa axis in any neighborhood of the initial point .",
    "when the point @xmath3 is in the upper half - plane , then the shortest network for the set @xmath4 has an additional vertex , where three its edges meet each other , and when @xmath3 is in the lower half - plane , then the shortest network for @xmath4 consists of two segments , @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "this example can be modified easily to generate infinitely many changes of non - degenerate shortest tree structures .",
    "consider a convex quadrangle in the plane , and let @xmath0 be the intersection point of its diagonals .",
    "assume that the vertices of this quadrangle can be connected by two locally minimal binary trees ( here binary tree is a tree , whose boundary vertices have degree @xmath7 , and all the other ones have degree @xmath8 ) .",
    "for each such tree consider the pair of vertical angles having vertex at @xmath0 and subtending the sides connecting adjacent boundary vertices .",
    "then , in accordance with  @xcite , the tree corresponding to the least angle is shorter , and hence , is a shortest one , i.e. , it is a steiner minimal tree ( and if the angles are equal o each other , then the both trees are shortest ) .",
    "take a square as the quadrangle .",
    "then its vertices are connected by two shortest binary trees , see figure  [ fig : examp2 ] .",
    "let us move one of the vertices of the square similarly to the previous example , namely , its trajectory oscillates around the straight line passing through the correspondent diagonal of the square . then the shortest tree connecting the four point set consisting of the three fixed vertices of the square and the moving one changes its type each time",
    "as the moving vertex passes across the straight line ( the combinatorial structure of the binary tree remains the same , but the way the tree is attached to the boundary set changes spasmodically ) .",
    "notice that both our examples are based on the same effect , namely , on an infinite number of oscillations in a finite interval of the parameter changing .",
    "the deformation constructed are smooth but not analytic .",
    "the main result of the present paper describes a class of deformations which such effects are impossible under .",
    "main theorem ( theorem  [ thm : main ] ) gives an answer for a sufficiently general case ( see below a general statement of the problem in terms of so - called metric functionals ) .",
    "as applications , the classical cases of shortest trees and minimal spanning trees in euclidean space are considered . it is shown ( see corollary  [ cor : euc_case_mst ] ) that _ if under a one - parametric deformation @xmath9 , @xmath10 $ ] , each point of an initial boundary set @xmath11 moves along an analytic curve , then for sufficiently small positive values of the parameter @xmath12 the families @xmath13 of the combinatorial types of the minimal spanning trees with the boundary @xmath9 are the same and contained in @xmath14_. to prove similar result for shortest trees we need an additional assumptions of so - called stability , see below , of all shortest trees with the initial boundary @xmath11 , see corollary  [ cor : smt_gen ] . the case of minimal fillings of finite metric spaces is also investigated , see corollaries  [ cor : mf_gen ] and  [ cor : mf_eucl ] . besides , for convenience , we include well - known formulas of the first and the second variation of the length of a segment in the euclidean space , see assertions  [ ass : deriv1 ] and  [ ass : deriv2 ] .",
