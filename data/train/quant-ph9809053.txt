    "for any probability density @xmath0 the quantile @xmath1 associated with the probability @xmath2 is defined in the mathematical literature , c.f .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite , by @xmath3 for a position- and time - dependent probability density @xmath4 we introduce the time - dependent _ quantile position _ @xmath5 through @xmath6 the change to the complementary integration interval is chosen merely for convenience .",
    "essential is the transfer of the quantile concept from a probability density in mathematical statistics to a space- and time - dependent distribution describing a physics problem .",
    "it yields for every time @xmath7 a well - defined point @xmath8 . considering @xmath9 as a _ quantile trajectory _",
    "we define the _ quantile velocity _",
    "@xmath10 , which obviously depends on the chosen value of @xmath11 .    in the case of a conserved probability",
    "the corresponding probability density fulfills the continuity equation of the form @xmath12 @xmath13 being the corresponding probability current density vanishing at infinity .",
    "equations ( [ eq : quant - def ] ) and ( [ eq : cont - eq ] ) permit a direct calculation of the quantile velocity @xmath14 . differentiating ( [ eq : quant - def ] ) with respect to time we immediately obtain @xmath15 equation ( [ eq : diff - quant ] ) is an ordinary differential equation for the quantile position @xmath8 , an implicit solution of which is given by ( [ eq : quant - def ] ) .    in an experiment with quantum - mechanical wave packets",
    "the quantile velocity can be determined on a statistical basis by time - of - flight measurements : one prepares by the same procedure @xmath16 single - particle wave packets and sets a clock to zero at the moment at which the spatial expectation value of a wave packet leaves the source . with a detector placed at position @xmath17",
    "one registers the arrival times @xmath18 of particles for @xmath19 and orders them such that @xmath20 .",
    "one picks the time @xmath21 which is the largest of the smallest @xmath22 times and chooses @xmath23 .",
    "the time @xmath21 is the arrival time of the quantile @xmath24 at the position @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath25 . by repeating the experiment with a detector at @xmath26 one obtains @xmath27 , etc .",
    "the points @xmath28 are discrete points on the quantile trajectory @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath17 and @xmath26 mark the beginning and the end of a potential barrier then @xmath29 is the quantile traversal time of the barrier .    in the case of classical systems ,",
    "e.g. , classical electrodynamics , the quantile velocity can quite naturally be interpreted as velocity of an electromagnetic signal .",
    "we identify the density @xmath30 with the ratio of the electromagnetic energy density @xmath31 and the total energy @xmath32 of the pulse .",
    "we say the signal has left the transmitter , if the fraction @xmath11 of the total energy has left the transmitter .",
    "it has reached the detector if the fraction @xmath11 has been absorbed by the detector .",
    "obviously a minimum amount of energy ( the threshold energy @xmath33 ) is needed in the detector to register a signal .",
    "one will therefore choose @xmath11 such that @xmath34 .",
    "as an example we consider the time development of a time - dependent gaussian probability distribution  @=11 @twocolumn @xmath35 @xmath36 this probability density describes just as well ( i ) the marginal distribution of a bivariate gaussian phase - space distribution of a classical assembly ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) of force - free particles of mass @xmath37 with initial position expectation value @xmath38 , initial spatial variation @xmath39 , and momentum expectation value @xmath40 , momentum variation @xmath41 , and velocity variation @xmath42 , and ( ii ) the spatial probability distribution of a quantum - mechanical force - free gaussian wave packet with the same initial parameters as the above classical distribution .",
    "equation ( [ eq : quant - def ] ) yields the quantile trajectories @xmath43 and thus the quantile velocities @xmath44",
    "here @xmath45 is the initial quantile position associated with @xmath11 according to the condition @xmath46 = p$ ] .",
    "if we take ( [ eq : gauss - dist ] ) to be a classical phase - space distribution , we note that the quantile trajectories @xmath47 are not trajectories of free particles possessing constant velocities @xmath48 . only for @xmath49 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath50 is the quantile trajectory identical to a particle trajectory .",
    "quantile trajectories of a free wave packet for different values of @xmath11 are shown as dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d - quant ] .",
    "our definition ( [ eq : quant - def ] ) allows a consistent description of motion also in the case of a non - conserved probability .",
    "we assume that instead of a normalization to one at all times , we have a loss of probability , @xmath51 as an illustration we consider again the time development of a wave packet prepared at @xmath52 to be a gaussian distribution with the same parameters as in ( [ eq : gauss - dist ] ) .",
    "in addition we introduce a temporal exponential decrease of the probability to find the particle anywhere in space , as for example caused by the presence of a constant purely imaginary potential .",
    "thus the probability density may be written in the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the temporal rate of probability loss and @xmath55 is given in equation ( [ eq : gauss - dist ] ) . instead of the continuity equation ( [ eq : cont - eq ] ) we have now @xmath56 @xmath57 being the current density of the non - conserved probability and @xmath58 describing the density of the temporal loss rate .",
    "for the quantile position @xmath5 we obtain the integro - differential equation @xmath59 the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d - quant ] are quantile trajectories for different values of @xmath11 .",
    "the curves end at the quantile position @xmath60 where the integral over the loss rate on the right  hand side of ( [ eq : dissip-3 ] ) equals the probability current density @xmath57 . at later times the probability loss term in ( [ eq : dissip-3 ] )",
    "dominates over the probability current density @xmath57 . for positions at values @xmath61 the condition ( [ eq : quant - def ] )",
    "can no longer be satisfied .",
    "note that the formulation of quantile motion for a non - conserved probability has general validity , since eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dissip-2 ] ) and ( [ eq : dissip-3 ] ) do not depend on the details of the probability loss .",
    "in the following we show that for the same value of @xmath11 and for two identically prepared , tunneling and free wave packets , the quantile position of the tunneling wave packet in the transmission region of the potential remains at any given time @xmath7 behind the quantile position of the free wave packet , i.e. , the arrival time of the tunneled quantile behind the barrier is always later than that of the free wave packet .",
    "we consider the tunneling of a wave packet with spectral function @xmath62 in momentum space through a repulsive square potential barrier , @xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "the probability densities of the tunneling and of the free wave packet with the same spectral function @xmath62 are denoted by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "the functions @xmath69 give the probabilities at time @xmath7 for the tunneling and the free particle to be found to the right of the position @xmath70 in the transmission region @xmath71 of the potential .",
    "since @xmath72 and @xmath73 decrease monotonically with @xmath70 , our statement is always true if the condition @xmath74 for @xmath71 is fulfilled .",
    "we consider a wave packet described by a spectral function @xmath62 with a positive wave number spectrum , i.e. , @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "the difference @xmath77 in the region @xmath71 is @xmath78     \\frac{\\widetilde{\\psi}(k';x , t)\\widetilde{\\psi}^*(k'';x , t ) } {     k'-k '' + { { \\rm i}}\\varepsilon } \\ , { { \\rm d}}k'{{\\rm d}}k '' \\ : , \\ ] ] where @xmath79 $ ] and @xmath80 is the transmission amplitude in momentum space for the repulsive square potential barrier ( @xmath81 ) .",

    "this procedure can be extended to the case of a general non - negative potential @xmath90 of finite range , introducing a segmentation of the potential into thin square potential barriers and then similarly parameterizing the difference @xmath77 to obtain a positive - definite expression @xcite .    in fig .",

    "[ fig:2d - quant]b the quantile trajectories @xmath91 for the same problem are presented . for small values of @xmath11",
    "the trajectories penetrate the barrier , for larger values they reverse their direction .",
    "we observe that in all cases the quantile velocity within the barrier region is smaller in absolute value than far from the barrier .",
    "bohm s interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite introduces particle trajectories @xmath92 satisfying the equation of motion @xmath93 .",
    "for the solution of this differential equation the initial condition @xmath94 is needed as a hidden parameter .",
    "if we set bohm s initial position @xmath95 equal to the initial quantile position @xmath96 the quantile trajectories are mathematically identical to bohm s particle trajectories .",
    "conceptually , however , they are based on the probability interpretation of the conventional quantum mechanics",
    ".    leavens and aers @xcite and spiller et  al .",
    "@xcite realized that bohm s interpretation of quantum mechanics  reintroducing the point - particle concept  offers the opportunity of unambiguously defining the velocity as in classical mechanics ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to their work our approach is based on the conventional probabilistic concepts and does not depend on the interpretation given by bohm . in ref .",
    "@xcite tunneling times are given which are based on the concept of bohm trajectories .",
    "mckinnon and leavens @xcite pointed out the significance with respect to tunnel times of a particular bohm trajectory for @xmath97 , with @xmath98 being the transmission probability .",
    "wu and sprung @xcite have discussed quantum probability patterns for stationary problems .",
    "the equivalence of equations ( [ eq : quant - def ] ) and ( [ eq : diff - quant ] ) has been noticed before , see , e.g. , @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was considered as an artifact of low dimensionality . in both papers ,",
    "this equivalence was not related to the probability interpretation made possible by equation ( [ eq : quant - def ] ) . however , the generalization to three dimensions is straightforward , if one considers that the interval between two quantile positions @xmath99 and @xmath100 always contains the same amount of probability @xmath101 and that all trajectories with initial positions @xmath102 stay in the interval @xmath103 .",
    "this suggests that in three dimensions trajectories defined by the equation of motion @xmath104 and having initial positions @xmath105 within a volume @xmath106 containing an amount @xmath11 of probability stay within a volume @xmath107 containing the same amount of probability . to prove this statement we introduce the time - dependent base of tangent vectors @xmath108 , where @xmath109 .",
