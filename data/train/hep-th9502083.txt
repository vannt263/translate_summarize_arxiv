    "the understanding of the color confinement mechanism is one of the most fascinating problems in qcd . in this paper",
    "we shall study the color confinement mechanism proposed by kugo and ojima ( ko ) @xcite .",
    "it is based on the brst quantized yang - mills theory ( coupled to the quark field @xmath0 ) described by the lagrangian ,",
    "@xmath1 with @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath3 .. the field variables @xmath4 are lie algebra valued and are expressed as @xmath5 in terms of hermitian fields @xmath6 and the ( anti - hermitian ) basis @xmath7 with the normalization @xmath8 . ] in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ym ] ) , @xmath9 is the brst transformation , and @xmath10 specifies the gauge fixing . in this paper",
    "we adopt as @xmath11 either @xmath12 $ ] corresponding to the feynman type gauge or @xmath13 of the osp(4/2 )  symmetric gauge @xcite ( @xmath14 is the gauge parameter and @xmath15 is the anti - brst transformation @xcite defined in the appendix ) .",
    "the confinement by the ko mechanism is in the sense that there are no _ physical color - carrying _ asymptotic fields .",
    "in contrast to the wilson loop criterion @xcite , the ko mechanism treats confinement of _ quantized _ quarks and gluons . according to kugo and ojima @xcite ,",
    "a sufficient condition for this confinement to be realized is that the brst - exact conserved color current of the system ( [ eq : ym ] ) , @xmath16\\bigr ) , \\label{eq : n}\\ ] ] contains no ( nambu - goldstone - like ) massless one - particle mode .",
    "if this condition is satisfied , the color charge @xmath17 is written in a well - defined manner as @xmath18 . the brst - exact expression",
    "@xmath19 ensures that any color non - singlet asymptotic states are necessarily brst unphysical and hence unobservable .    differently to the wilson loop criterion , the ko mechanism seems to have little relationship to the observable qcd dynamics creating mesons and baryons . due to this property , however , the ko confinement mechanism may be studied rather simply without being bothered by complicated observable dynamics .",
    "an extreme example of the realization of this expectation is the pure - gauge model ( pgm ) @xcite .",
    "this is a toy model for the ko confinement mechanism .",
    "the pgm is obtained from the yang - mills system ( [ eq : ym ] ) by restricting the gauge field @xmath20 to the pure - gauge configuration , @xmath21 , and therefore is described by the `` topological '' lagrangian : @xmath22 although the pgm has only unphysical gauge - modes , the ko condition that @xmath23 is free from the massless mode is still a non - trivial problem of dynamics . if we adopt the osp(4/2 )  symmetric gauge with @xmath24 ( [ eq : gosp ] ) , the pgm in four dimensions becomes equivalent to the chiral model in two dimensions owing to the parisi - sourlas mechanism @xcite .",
    "this equivalence and the fact that the chiral model in two dimensions is realized in the disordered phase with a mass gap @xcite implies that the ko condition is actually satisfied in the pgm with the osp(4/2 )  symmetric gauge @xcite .",
    "this property is expected to be shared with the ordinary feynman type gauge @xcite .",
    "a lesson we learn from pgm is that , among the degrees of freedom in @xmath20 , the large fluctuation of the gauge - mode @xmath25 , namely the mode in the direction of the gauge transformation , is important for the ko confinement mechanism ( cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a method to perturbatively introduce physical degrees of freedom into the pgm and study the ko confinement mechanism in the real yang - mills theory . roughly speaking",
    "what we would like to do is to express the gauge field as @xmath26 and treat the physical - modes as perturbation to pgm .",
    "the parameter of our perturbation expansion is simply the gauge coupling constant @xmath27 ( note that the pgm is obtained from the yang - mills system ( [ eq : ym ] ) in the vanishing coupling constant limit @xmath28 ) .",
    "we see that , in this perturbation method , quark and gluon fields are confined by the ko mechanism due to the large fluctuation of the gauge - mode @xmath25 .",
    "a similar attempt to adding physical modes to the pgm was made by izawa @xcite using the bf formulation .",
    "the organization of the rest of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "for carrying out the perturbation expansion around the pgm , we shall first modify the yang - mills system ( [ eq : ym ] ) by introducing the new auxiliary fields .",
    "that is , we rewrite the system in such a way that the gauge field is expressed as a sum of the pure - gauge mode @xmath29 and the other ( physical ) modes . consider the partition function @xmath30={\\int\\!}{{\\cal d}}a_\\mu { { \\cal d}}c { { \\cal d}}{\\overline{c}}{{\\cal d}}\\ !",

    "the remaining integration in ( [ eq : zf ] ) over the pgm fields @xmath50  should be treated non - perturbatively .",

    "the case of the green s functions containing the quark fields @xmath0 and @xmath79 can be treated similarly .",
    "now let us consider how the color confinement by the ko mechanism is realized in the perturbation expansion explained in the last section .",
    "although the ko confinement condition is satisfied in pgm , there is no physical modes to be confined . differently to the pgm",
    "the present model does contain physical degrees of freedom , and we shall see that they are indeed confined owing to the disorder of the gauge - mode @xmath25 . before starting the discussion , we here stress that we are interested in the confinement of the su@xmath52  color charge carried by the original fields @xmath80 and abandon the confinement of su@xmath53  charge of @xmath81 .",
    "these two color charges are physically equivalent and both should be confined in a more complete treatment of yang - mills theory . however , our perturbation expansion discriminates between these two color charges .",
    "we shall discuss the confinement of su@xmath52  color in two different ways : one is to see directly the absence of the physical asymptotic states of @xmath0 and @xmath20 , and the other is to study the sufficient condition for confinement , i.e. , the absence of the nambu - goldstone mode coupled to the brst - exact su@xmath52  color current @xmath23 ( [ eq : n ] ) .",
    "first , let us consider the asymptotic fields of quarks and gluons .",
    "the question is whether the two - point functions @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( in momentum space ) have discrete poles corresponding to the physical asymptotic states .",
    "however , these discrete poles are absent in the lowest order of our perturbation expansion .",
    "this is seen as follows . using the expression ( [ eq : expansion ] ) for the original quark field @xmath0 in terms of @xmath38 and @xmath49 , we have @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes the green s function in the pgm , and @xmath86 is the free propagator ( @xmath87 are the su@xmath35 color indices in the fundamental representation ) .",
    "the point is that the pgm is in the disordered phase where su@xmath53@xmath88su@xmath52  symmetry is realized linearly and the su@xmath35-valued field @xmath25 has @xmath89 independent excitation modes ; @xmath90 with @xmath91 being the mass gap of the pgm ( in particular , we have @xmath92 ) .",
    "namely , @xmath66 is a genuine two - body composite operator and there is no interaction between the two in the lowest order in our expansion .",
    "therefore , although the auxiliary quark field @xmath38 has an asymptotic field , the original quark field @xmath0 does not . in a word , the large fluctuation of the gauge - mode @xmath49 screens the asymptotic field of the auxiliary field @xmath38 .",
    "the ko confinement mechanism requires only that the quark asymptotic fields , if they exist , are brst unphysical @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the asymptotic field of @xmath0 is totally absent .",
    "the absence of the pole in the green s function @xmath93 remains in general true in our perturbation theory so long as su@xmath53@xmath88su@xmath52  is a good quantum number .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "a possible origin of the discrete pole in @xmath93 is one - particle intermediate propagation of the auxiliary field @xmath38 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pp ] ) .",
    "however , this is impossible since @xmath38 is su@xmath52  singlet while @xmath0 is su@xmath52  non - singlet . as for the gauge field @xmath20 ,",
    "the situation is essentially the same as the quark field explained above .",
    "note that , if the whole system including the pgm sector is treated in naive perturbation theory , the two - point function ( [ eq : psipsi ] ) has a discrete pole since we have @xmath94 with @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) being the nambu - goldstone mode .",
    "next , we shall look at the ko mechanism in the context of the absence of the nambu - goldstone mode coupled to the brst - exact color current @xmath23 ( [ eq : n ] ) .",
    "this is almost trivially satisfied in any finite order in our perturbation expansion , since the su@xmath53@xmath88su@xmath52  symmetry remains to be realized in a linear manner and @xmath23 is nothing but the noether current of su@xmath52 .",
    "however , we shall see how it is satisfied more concretely .",
    "the following is almost the repetition of the argument for the quark confinement given above .",
    "the nambu - goldstone mode coupled to @xmath23 , if it exists , should be revealed as a massless pole in the two - point function @xmath97 with @xmath98 being an operator constructed from the original fields , for example @xmath99 @xcite . within our perturbation theory",
    "the only possible origin of the massless pole contributing to this green s function is the auxiliary gauge field @xmath37 with the free propagator ( [ eq : pa ] ) .",
    "however , the diagrams having a single @xmath37 as its intermediate state vanish due to the conflict of the su@xmath53@xmath88su@xmath52  quantum number ( @xmath37 is su@xmath52  singlet while @xmath23 and @xmath98 are su@xmath52  non - singlets ) .",
    "summarizing , what is important for ( and almost equivalent to ) the ko confinement mechanism is that the gauge - mode @xmath25 is in the disordered phase and the su@xmath53@xmath88su@xmath52  symmetry is realized in a linear manner .",
    "this property holds in the pgm and also in any finite order in our perturbation expansion .",
    "however , it is not clear at all whether this property persists beyond our perturbation expansion in @xmath27 , and this is our most important future subject .",
    "in this section we shall apply our perturbation theory to the finite temperature case . in particular",
