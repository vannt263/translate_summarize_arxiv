    "ever since the discovery of gamma ray bursts @xcite the main questions posed by the astronomers in this field were what is the distance scale to these phenomena , and consequently what is their spatial distribution . for almost three decades",
    "the main tools for probing the distance scale to gamma - ray bursts were studies of their statistical properties , and model dependent physical arguments .",
    "in fact in the great debate in 1995 the main argument for the cosmological distance scale was the isotropy of grbs on the sky @xcite .",
    "apart from the distribution studies there have been a number of attempts to measure the distance scale , and the spatial distribution of grbs using different methods , based on e.g. the temporal or spectral studies , searches for gravitational lensing etc . since the discovery of afterglows @xcite and measurement of grb redshifts @xcite we have entered a new era in the grb research and now we can probe directly the spatial distribution of grbs . the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 i analyze the angular distribution of grbs , in section 3 i review the constraints on their spatial distribution , in section 4 classes of grbs are discussed , and the results are summarized in section 5 .",
    "the angular distribution of gamma ray bursts is very close to isotropy . in the current batse catalogue @xcite",
    "we find that the galactic dipole and quadrupole moments are consistent with the values expected for isotropy when taking into account the nonuniform exposure .",
    "the current measured value of the dipole moments in the galactic coordinates is @xmath4 , with the expected value equal to @xmath5 , while the quadrupole moment is @xmath6 , compared to the expected value @xmath7 .    while the integral moments do not describe the entire distribution",
    ", one can perform a more detailed comparison using the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) tests of the distribution of the galactic coordinates of the bursts .",
    "the ks test comparison shows an excellent agreement between the expected and observed distributions of right ascensions @xmath8 , where the probability that the distributions are identical is 97% ; the probability for the distribution of declinations is smaller - 22% .",
    "this is probably due to uncertainty of the batse sky exposure map .",
    "this uncertainty is also seen when comparing the galactic coordinates distribution : here the ks probabilities are 14% for galactic latitude distribution and 32% for the galactic longitude distribution .",
    "thus the distribution of grbs is consistent with isotropy on the sky . in the first batse catalogue @xcite",
    "there was an evidence of variation of the galactic moments with brightness @xcite .",
    "this effect disappeared in the later catalogues .",
    "therefore in the remaining part of the paper i assume that the spatial distribution of grbs can be factorized into the independent angular and radial parts , and that the angular part is isotropic .",
    "the most comprehensive studies of the isotropy and comparisons with anisotropic models have been performed by @xcite .",
    "various statistical methods were used for analyzing the gamma - ray burst brightness distributions .",
    "some authors divided the observed bursts in bins and used a @xmath9 statistics to compare the number of bursts in these bins with models .",
    "the shortcoming of this method is that the results depend on the arbitrary parameter ( or parameters ) , i.e. the number and the width of the bins .",
    "this makes the calculation of statistical significance difficult , since in most cases the authors do not discuss the effects of the bin width .",
    "usually the bins are chosen in such a way to ensure that the number of counts in each bin allows using the gaussian approximation .",
    "another possibility is to use the kolmogorov smirnov test , which measures the largest deviation between the model and the expected cumulative distribution .",
    "it seems that the most sensitive , yet also most computationally demanding method is the maximum likelihood method , which takes into account all information contained in the data .",
    "studies of grb brightness distribution require a definition of brightness of a given burst .",
    "several measures of brightness have been used : e.g. the peak flux , or the fluence .",
    "each measure of brightness introduces systematic instrumental effects .",
    "the measured fluence depends on the background level in a particular detector and on the true time history of a burst .",
    "given that the fluence of a given burst will not necessarily follow the @xmath10 law , even for simple , one peak bursts .",
    "the peak flux suffers from the so called meegan bias .",
    "given a burst with a couple peaks we will tend to choose the moment of the maximum flux as the one where the poisson fluctuation upwards were the largest .",
    "this effect will lead to overestimates of the flux , and the amount of change will depend on the particular time history of the burst .",
    "the peak flux distribution will also depend on the particular timescale on which this peak flux was measured .",
    "the value of each brightness measure depends also on the spectral response of the detector , and on the spectral interval considered .",
    "the distributions of peak fluxes , and fluences of grbs are shown in figure  [ bright ] .",
    "the observed bursting rate @xmath11 of grbs can be described by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the density of the sources , @xmath14 is the luminosity distance , @xmath15 is the flux , and @xmath16 is the luminosity function . in general",
    "we measure only the observed flux @xmath15 , however , recently for some burst also the redshifts @xmath17 have been measured . moreover , in a detailed calculation k - corrections should be added to equation  [ basic ] .    the simplest model of cosmological grbs is with standard candle luminosity function , and no source evolution .",
    "such a model has been considered by a number of authors ; @xcite showed using an @xmath18 that the brightness distribution of grbs is consistent with a simple cosmological interpretation with no free parameters .",
    "they found that the maximum redshift is constrained to be @xmath19 ; see also @xcite .",
    "@xcite found @xmath20 using the @xmath21 comparison .",
    "@xcite used the ks - test of the number count distribution in the 2b catalogue and found that the maximal redshift must be @xmath22 . in a detailed study with the use of maximum likelihood analysis of the 3b data @xcite constrained the standard candle luminosity of grbs to be @xmath23ergs@xmath24 .",
    "the effects of the grb rate density evolution are usually included by assuming that @xmath25 . in general the results show that the higher the exponent @xmath26 , the more luminous grbs are .",
    "the luminosity of a standard candle bursts grows very rapidly with the exponent @xmath26 , however the details vary from one paper to another and depend on the particular data set used ( batse or batse and pvo ) @xcite      when considering the luminosity function of grbs one has to distinguish between the observed and intrinsic luminosity functions .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity function is the distribution of luminosities of all bursts regardless of whether we see them or not , while the observed luminosity function is the distribution of luminosities of the observed bursts only .",
    "it has been shown that the two distributions are different , and may even have different slopes .",
    "the luminosity function is usually represented by a power on a fixed interval , however other functional forms like e.g. the lognormal distribution are also used .",
    "there were several papers discussing the effects of the luminosity function on the shape of the brightness distribution .",
    "@xcite used the integral moment analysis and concluded that the width of the observed luminosity function must be smaller than a factor of @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite used a two @xmath28 functions approximation of the luminosity function and constrained the width of such luminosity function to less than a factor of @xmath29 in the case of batse data and less than a factor of @xmath2 for the combined batse and pvo data sets .",
    "@xcite parameterized the luminosity function as a lognormal distribution , used ks - test to compare with the observed @xmath30 distribution , and found that the width of the luminosity function must be less than about a factor of @xmath31 .",
    "some studies of the effects of the luminosity function were done assuming a halo - core like spatial distribution : @xcite modeled the batse brightness distribution using the maximum likelihood method and found essentially no limits on the intrinsic luminosity function , however @xcite used the combined batse+pvo ) dataset and found the the observed luminosity function width is less than 10 .",
    "@xcite also considered a halo - like distribution and using the ks - test found that batse data is consistent with the luminosity function wider than a factor of 100 .",
    "analyses of the combined batse+pvo dataset with @xmath9 yielded constraints that the luminosity function width must be less than a factor of 1000 @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyze the gamma ray burst luminosity function using bayesian statistics and maximum likelihood method .",
    "they find that the current data set ( batse 3b catalogue ) does not constrain the intrinsic luminosity function .",
    "the main reason is that the differences between the models should show only for much fainter fluxes than the batse threshold ( see fig . 25 in their paper ) .",
    "they also find the width of the _ observed _ luminosity function is around @xmath32 .",
    "thus the studies of the grb luminosity function by analysis of the brightness distribution has taken an unusual direction : initially with small amount of data it seemed that the width of the luminosity function is small , yet with the increasing amount of data and improved statistical methods it appeared that its width can actually be large .",
    "there are no strong constraints on the width of the intrinsic luminosity function of grbs from the brightness distribution .",
    "it is natural to attempt to use the temporal characteristic of grbs to find constraints on the distance scale within the framework of the cosmological model . assuming that weaker bursts are typically further away",
    "they should also be longer , due to cosmological redshift .",
    "it should be noted that it is difficult to obtain an absolute scale without a physical model or knowledge of a clock in bursts .",
    "one can only measure the relative distance ( redshift ) between groups of weak and bright bursts .",
    "thus the absolute distance scale can be obtained then assuming a distance to the weakest bursts .",
    "the method is based on finding a correlation between brightness and duration , or other measure of the intrinsic timescale in gamma - ray burst .",
    "studies of temporal characteristics of grbs require defining a fundamental timescale for grbs .",
    "this is not easy , since grb time histories are very diverse .",
    "batse catalogue provides two measures of duration @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , the time in which @xmath35 and @xmath36 percent of the photons arrived .",
    "i present the correlation between these two measures of duration in left panel of figure  [ temporal ] .",
    "the spread in these correlation is significant and this shows that there are possible systematic effects that may affect the brightness - duration studies .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ temporal ] shows the distribution of batse grbs in the duration ( @xmath34 ) and brightness ( peak flux on the @xmath37ms timescale ) plane .",
    "no correlation is apparent in this graph .",
    "thus several authors decided to analyze the batse data themselves and measure durations , or time scales defined differently .",
    "we present a sample of the results obtained with the use of different methods , different measurements of burst durations in table  [ fludur ] . typically regardless of the method",
    "a stretch factor of approximately 2 was found , meaning that the typical clock for weak bursts runs slower than that for the bright ones .",
    "there are some exceptions : @xcite and @xcite found no difference between the bright and the dim bursts .",
    "the stretch factor of @xmath38 was interpreted as the redshift of the dim burst of approximately @xmath39 .",
    "however , @xcite noticed that in each given burst the width of the peaks is larger when measuring low energy channels than in the case of high energy ones .",
    "this leads to the so - called w - correction ; the effects of redshift is not only slowing down the clocks but also shifting to lower energies , where the peaks are wider .",
    "the inclusion of this correction lead to a new limit on the redshift of the dim bursts @xmath40 for the stretch factor of @xmath2 .",
    "it has to be noted that it is always difficult to separate the effects of source evolution from the true cosmological effect in these studies .",
    "in fact @xcite interpreted the variation in the slope of decay of grb profiles as due to the evolution of sources .    [ fludur ]    .grb time stretching results . [ cols=\"<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      the host galaxy problem , for quite a while called the `` no host problem ''",
    "was first presented by @xcite .",
    "he analyzed the contents of error boxes of brightest bursts with the accurate ipn localization , in search of galaxies and found that these boxes contain no galaxies to the limit of twentieth magnitude , while expecting to find nearby galaxies of magnitude @xmath41 in them .",
    "of course , in this calculation it was assumed that grbs are not totally exotic phenomena and therefore are taking place in galaxies .",
    "this finding led to the conclusion that the standard cosmological model ( with typical grb luminosity @xmath42ergs ) has some difficulty .",
    "an analysis of the infrared galaxy catalog by @xcite , was claimed to show consistency of the contents of grb errors boxes with the cosmological model , however @xcite showed using bayesian analysis that the infrared data set provided no really useful limits .",
    "recently this problem has been revisited by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed the contents of 26 small grb error boxes and concluded that the lower limit on grb luminosity is @xmath43phot@xmath44s@xmath24 , assuming no evolution of sources .",
    "@xcite applied the bayesian methods to the dataset of @xcite and eight bepposax bursts with good localization and host galaxies .",
    "this analysis rules out burst energies below @xmath45ergs , and favors , although not strongly , the value @xmath46ergs .",
    "given that grbs are located at the cosmological distances , some of them should , like all other distant sources , be gravitationally lensed @xcite . since grbs are transients , a lensed burst would consist of two ( or more ) bursts with identical spectra and time profiles , however delayed in time by typically a month . @xcite",
    "first estimated of the lensing probability to lie between 0.05% and 0.4% .",
    "the lensing probability decreases with the time delay on a timescale of a month , and it was found to peak at @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the mass of the lensing object . thus acquiring a large enough database of bursts should allow to find lensed gamma - ray bursts .",
    "however one has to bear in mind that there are some significant selection effects against detecting lensed events .",
    "first , batse does not monitor all sky simultaneously , the average exposure being about 40% of the sky time .",
    "moreover , after detecting a burst batse turn into inactive mode for a 90 minutes .",
    "if a burst happens at this time it is only recorded if it is stronger than the preceding burst however , than the information on the preceding burst is lost . thus detecting lensed bursts with time delays",
    "up to 90 minutes is hardly possible .",
    "searches for lensed grb in the batse database were conducted @xcite yielding null results .    the gravitational lensing problem has recently been revisited by @xcite , who found that actually including multiple lensing is important .",
    "they have calculated lensing probabilities as a function of the average redshift @xmath0 of the grb distribution for different cosmologies .",
    "basing on no detection of grb lensing they derive an upper limit on the average redshift @xmath49 for @xmath50 pairs @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 respectively",
    ". it should be noted that the gravitational lensing probes the spatial distribution of grbs directly and is not very sensitive to the luminosity function .",
    "while the overall distribution of grbs shows an amazing degree of isotropy there is also a question of isotropy or clustering on the small angular scales .",
    "there has been evidence for such anisotropy - small scale clustering of burst - in the first batse catalogue found by @xcite , who interpreted it as evidence for burst repeating . however , with the change of the batse localization algorithm the small scale clustering detection was not confirmed , and has not been seen in the larger data sets .    within the framework of the cosmological model small scale clustering",
    "is expected , if bursts trace luminous matter .",
    "@xcite suggested that given a large enough sample of bursts the large scale structure in the universe should be detectable : 1000 bursts should suffice to probe the supercluster scales , and about 3000 bursts should probe the scales above @xmath55mpc .",
    "these results were used with the batse 3b catalogue to find that the median distance to the weak bursts must be larger than @xmath56mpc , and the closest burst must be further away than @xmath57mpc @xcite . while these limits are not very constraining they grow approximately linearly with the number of bursts detected provided that no clustering is found .",
    "alternatively , the number of grbs in the current batse database should soon allow to probe the large scale structure .",
    "the studies of grb spatial distribution have entered a new era in the beginning of 1997 with the bepposax discovery of x - ray afterglows @xcite , this led to rapid optical followups and the discovery of optical afterglows @xcite , and consequently to identification of host galaxies @xcite .",
    "the accurate optical spectroscopy of either the afterglows themself of the host galaxies allows to find grb redshifts , with the first redshift of 0.835 measured for grb970508 @xcite . at the time of writing there are nine grb redshifts measured , including two which are rather uncertain . a list of the grbs with measured redshifts is presented in table  [ zees ] .",
    "this table was prepared with the aid of the information posted on jochen greiners web page @xcite .",

    "there is no clear correlation between the redshift and peak flux , i even had to use the logarithmic scale to show all the fluxes .",
    "this indicates that the grb luminosity function is broad . in the right panel of figure  [ red ]",
    "i present the cumulative distribution of peak photon luminosities for beppo sax bursts with redshift . in this figure",
    "i have omitted two asm / rxte bursts from table  [ zees ] and also grb980425 which , if the identification with sn1998bw is correct would be five orders of magnitude fainter .",
    "the luminosities have been calculated assuming that @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and @xmath66kms@xmath67mpc@xmath24 .",
    "the observed luminosity function is a factor of almost @xmath3 wide , and this result has been obtained already with a small sample of a few burst .",
    "this is an indication that the intrinsic luminosity of function of grbs could be even broader than that !    with the measurements of redshifts we can now directly probe the spatial distribution of grbs .",
    "the cumulative distribution of grb redshifts measured to date is presented in figure  [ zdist ] .",
    "i have included all the entries from table  [ zees ] in this figure , despite the fact that , as discussed above , some of the entries could be uncertain . also since we know that the luminosity function is very broad we may not be detecting all the bursts from high redshifts .",
    "therefore studies of grbs with more sensitive instruments are very important .",
    "models for grbs associate them with late stages of stellar evolution , either compact object mergers , or collapsars .",
    "thus one expects a relation between the star formation rate and the grb bursting rate .",
    "the star formation rate has recently been measured in the hubble deep field @xcite , which shows a dramatic change in the star formation rate between @xmath68 and present .",
    "@xcite calculated the expected grb rate based on the known star formation history and the synthesis of stellar ( and binary ) evolution .",
    "@xcite fitted the combined batse and pvo brightness distribution with a star formation model , and the dimmest burst could come from the redshifts as high as @xmath69 .",
    "based on their results i present a model with the grb rate proportional to star formation rate in figure  [ zdist ] .",
    "while the two curves do not match very well , they look similar despite the fact that no selection effects due to detector sensitivity , or luminosity function were taken into account .",
    "this could be an indication that grbs are connected with star formation .",
    "all that has been written above was based on the assumption that there is only one population of grbs .",
    "there are however some indications that there may exist different classes of grbs .",
    "one of the first batse results was to show the bimodality of the duration distribution @xcite , with typical durations of less than a second and a few tens of seconds . at the same time",
    "it has been found that grbs can be grouped according to their duration and variability properties and form two classes - short variable , and long smooth @xcite .",
    "moreover brightness distributions of bursts with different hardness ratios are different @xcite .",
    "the low hardness ratio bursts show a typically steeper behavior in the cumulative brightness distributions , while the harder bursts are those that actually show the rollover in this distribution .    in the left panel figure  [ durhard ]",
    "i present the batse bursts in the duration - hardness plane ( hardness is defined as the ratio of the fluxes in batse channels 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the duration bimodality is clearly seen , moreover the long bursts have typically softer spectra than the short ones , although there is a significant overlap .",
    "the properties of grbs have been analyzed by dividing them into different classes on the hardness duration plot . used a line defined by @xmath70 .",
    "@xcite divides the bursts into four groups by two lines : duration of @xmath71s , and hardness ratio @xmath72 .",
    "only the long hard bursts @xmath73-@xmath74 distribution shows deviation from the euclidean @xmath75 slope .",
    "i present the peak flux distributions of the long and short burst in the right panel figure  [ durhard ] .",
    "such different brightness distributions could indicate that there are two populations with different luminosities . on the other hand",
    "a similar effect has been found when analyzing distribution the peaks in batse bursts @xcite .",
    "peaks in grbs evolve typically from hard to soft spectra , and one could speculate that the short bursts are just single peaked , while the longer ones contain more of the soft emission from the tails of the peaks . it should be noted that sax probes only long bursts ( duration larger than @xmath76s ) and so far all but one burst have been in the hard category .    the discovery of an unusual supernova in the errorbox of grb980425 @xcite has sparked a debate on a possibility of the association of grbs and supernovae . if the association were correct then gamma - ray luminosity of grb980425 would be much smaller than the typical luminosity of grbs .",
    "it is still unclear whether this association is correct and if there exists a class of supernova related grbs .",
    "if it does then it would be interesting to find out what fraction of grbs this class constitutes , and whether the supernovae related bursts are related to one of the grb classes shown above . if there exists a class of under luminous , supernova related grbs then the faint bursts should be dominated by distant bursts in this class .",
    "a future very sensitive experiment may resolve this , however it looks more promising to pursue better quick localizations and multi wavelength followups .",
    "gamma - ray bursts sky distribution is consistent with isotropy to a very high degree .",
    "the estimates of the distance scale and spatial distribution of grbs seem to converge .",
    "the typical gamma - ray burst lie at redshifts of @xmath1 to @xmath2 , however this distribution probably has a long tail extending to higher redshifts .",
    "grb luminosity function is broad ; from the observation of just a few bursts we already see that the observed luminosity function is almost a factor of one thousand wide .",
    "this means that the luminosity function plays a crucial role in shaping the grb brightness distribution .",
    "one of the the brightest bursts seen by batse - grb990123 - lies at the redshift of @xmath77 !",
    "it is possible that there exist different classes of grb within what we call now cosmic grbs .",
    "this could reflect either different physical mechanism connected with the central engine ( compact object mergers or collapsars ) , or perhaps even orientation effects .",
    "only the long and hard bursts duration distribution exhibits a rollover characteristic for the cosmological models , and this could be an indication that the remaining bursts with euclidean brightness distributions are different . finally , one should note that while the evidence for identification of grb980425 with sn1998bw is still uncertain , it is certainly worth to investigate a possible grb - supernova connection .    the author wishes to thank the organizers for making the graftavallen meeting a success in both science and fun categories .",
    "i would like to thank s.  bajtlik , k. belczyski , and m. chodorowski for help in preparing this manuscript .",
