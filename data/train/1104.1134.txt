    "the existence of dark matter ( dm ) has been established by plenty of cosmological observations , and its total abundance in the universe has been evaluated in the last decade with high precision by the wmap experiment @xcite .",
    "a possible interpretation of such observations relies on the existence of a new stable particle species , the so - called wimp ( weakly interacting massive particle ) .",
    "however , the nature and the properties of this new particle are far from being established .",
    "numerous candidates have been proposed from the theoretical side , and numerous attempts have been made to detect it both directly and indirectly .",
    "some of the direct detection experiments ( in which nucleon recoil by invisible incoming particles is measured ) have recently reported possible signals of dm , while others have found no excess above the background .",
    "the situation has not been settled yet ( for some recent discussions , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . besides the long - standing dama  @xcite evidence for an annual modulated signal , claims for signals",
    "have been recently made by cogent  @xcite and cresst  @xcite .",
    "what is intriguing is that all these experimental results could be explained by a rather light wimp with a sizeable spin - independent scattering cross - section with nucleons  @xcite : @xmath4    on the other hand , the most extensively studied framework for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is represented by supersymmetry ( susy ) and , in particular , by the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( so - called mssm ) , with the lightest neutralino as a candidate of dark matter , in case r - parity is conserved .",
    "it is therefore natural and compelling to ask whether the mssm neutralino can account for the dm properties suggested by the direct detection experiments , as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cogent ] ) .",
    "this question has been recently addressed by several collaborations  @xcite ( for previous works on light neutralinos , see @xcite ) . however , these works do not agree in the conclusions . in particular , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite performed a fit requiring the wmap constraint on the dm relic density together with several indirect constraints on the model parameters to be satisfied .",
    "they concluded that the lightest neutralino mass must be larger than 28 gev , thus excluding that the properties summarized in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cogent ] ) can be accounted for by the mssm lightest neutralino . on the contrary , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite claimed the viability of the parameter regime with a light neutralino ( @xmath5 gev ) and the direct detection cross - section as large as @xmath6 @xmath7 .    in this paper",
    ", we study the mssm parameter space to re - consider the compatibility of the lightest neutralino with the properties suggested by the direct detection experiments and shed light on the conflict mentioned above .",
    "we restrict ourselves on the particle content of the mssm , i.e. we do not consider possible variations or extensions of the minimal model ( such as the nmssm ) , which have been recently studied in this context by different collaborations  @xcite .",
    "the key points of our analysis are summarized in the following .",
    "* we study in detail the low - energy constraints , which challenge a light neutralino scenario , with a particular emphasis on the processes that have no strong dependence on the susy parameters but only on the higgs sector parameters .",
    "the most relevant observables turn out to be the @xmath8 decay and the kaon physics observable @xmath9 , extracted from the decay @xmath10 , which has not considered in previous works on light neutralino dark matter . *",
    "we perform a numerical scan of the susy parameter space , without adopting any high - energy relation among the parameters , which are instead treated as low - energy free parameters , and we then identify the regions fulfilling all the relevant constraints . *",
    "we study the impact of lep and tevatron higgs searches on the light neutralino parameter space . *",
    "we analyze the specific consequences for the higgs sector , the low - energy processes , the susy parameter space and direct dm searches , discussing the prospects for experimentally probing the light neutralino scenario .    besides a quite different treatment of the experimental contraints , with the inclusion of more observables in the analysis ( such as @xmath9 ) , the phenomenological analysis of the paramater space compatible with light neutralino dm represents the main new feature of the present work with respect to the previous related literature @xcite .",
    "in particular , as we will see , this study will allow us to identify several independent ways to test light neutralino dm scenarios in the near future .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the main constraints are discussed in section [ sec : lowe ] ; in section [ sec : numerical ] the numerical analysis of the parameter space is presented and the phenomenological consequences are discussed in section [ sec : prospects ] . in section [ sec : direct ] , the impact of direct dm search experiments is discussed . finally , our findings are summarized in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "within the mssm , a neutralino as light as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cogent ] ) requires @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are respectively the @xmath14 and @xmath15 gaugino mass parameters and @xmath16 is the higgs bilinear mixing parameter of the superpotential .",
    "in fact , @xmath13 and @xmath16 enter the chargino mass matrix and are therefore bounded to be @xmath17 gev , by the lep limit on chargino masses . as a result ,",
    "the lightest neutralino is mostly bino . as usual in the mssm , the bino - like dm ( especially if light , as in the case we are considering )",
    "is thermally overproduced in the early universe .",
    "therefore , to obtain the appropriate relic abundance , an efficient annihilation process is necessary .",
    "since an efficient slepton mediated annihilation would require sleptons with masses smaller than the lep limit  @xcite , for a neutralino mass in the range we are interested in , the only way to enhance the neutralino annihilation cross - section is through the mediation of a cp - odd higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "this requires the cp - odd higgs to be as light as @xmath18 gev and a somewhat large value of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the entire spectrum of the extended higgs sector of the mssm is therefore required to lie around 100 gev ( we recall for instance the tree level relation @xmath19 ) .",
    "this choice of the parameters causes several phenomenological difficulties .",
    "indeed , cp - odd and charged higgs exchanges contribute to several rare decays .",
    "therefore , a light higgs sector can induce large deviations from the sm , especially in the large @xmath2 regime @xcite . for recent discussions , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we can conveniently group the most relevant observables in two categories .    * the processes , which mainly depend on the higgs sector parameters ( i.e. @xmath20 and @xmath2 ) and have a dependence on the other susy parameters only through threshold corrections to the yukawa couplings .",
    "this group includes the following decays : @xmath8 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 . * the processes which get higgs - mediated contributions but have in addition a non - trivial dependence on the susy spectrum and the susy parameters . for our discussion ,",
    "the most relevant observables of this kind are @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    in the case of the processes of this second group , an appropriate choice of the susy parameters",
    "can avoid unacceptably large deviations from the sm expectations .",
    "as it is well known , this is the case of @xmath25 , whose charged higgs contribution can be compensated by a sizeable stop - chargino contribution . on the other hand ,",
    "the processes of group ( i ) provide strong constraints to the possible values of @xmath20 and @xmath2 , which challenge a light neutralino scenario almost independently on the details of the susy spectrum .",
    "therefore , let us start reviewing the processes of group ( i ) .",
    "the charged higgs boson ( @xmath26 ) mediates the @xmath27 decay at tree - level .",
    "remarkably , the charged higgs contribution has opposite sign with respect to the sm contribution . the resulting deviation from the sm prediction",
    "can be then expressed as following @xcite : @xmath28^{2}. \\label{eq : btn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the mass of the @xmath30 meson ( @xmath31 gev ) and @xmath32 accounts for the non - holomorphic susy threshold corrections to the down quark yukawas , while we neglect the corresponding leptonic correction for the moment .    due to the dependence of @xmath33 on @xmath2 ,",
    "the experimentally allowed range of @xmath33 will clearly identify two possible ranges of @xmath34 for a given value of @xmath35 : either a small / moderate @xmath34 regime , where br(@xmath27 ) is decreased with respect to the sm prediction only to a certain extent , or a large @xmath34 regime , for which the charged higgs contribution is approximately twice the sm one , so that the difference between them still provides a value for @xmath33 within the experimental range .",
    "this second possibility is however strongly challenged by other processes , for which the higgs - mediated contribution increases with @xmath2 .",
    "the most relevant example is @xmath36 . in order to reduce theoretical uncertainties",
    ", it is convenient to consider the following quantity  @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the values of the ckm matrix entries as extracted from the processes indicated in the parentheses .",
    "this quantity depends mainly on the mass of the charged higgs boson and @xmath34 as well .",
    "it is therefore complementary to @xmath27 in constraining the parameter space , especially for the larger @xmath34 region among two allowed regions by @xmath27 .",
    "the analytic formula is given by  @xcite : @xmath40 \\frac{\\tan^{2 } \\beta}{1 + \\epsilon \\tan \\beta } \\right| , \\label{eq : rl23}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 gev and the quark mass ratio @xmath42 takes a value between 1/22 and 1/17  @xcite .",
    "for a large value of @xmath2 , the 3-body decay @xmath43 may deviate from the sm prediction as well .",
    "the complete formula for @xmath43 is more involved than the 2-body decays which we have considered so far . a compact approximated expression , given in ref .",

    "[ fig : mhc - tb ] .",
    "we first notice that the plot is bounded from below , such that @xmath53 .",
    "this is a consequence of the upper bound on the neutralino relic density , @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , for smaller values of @xmath2 the neutralino annihilation cross - section results too low to efficiently decrease the relic abundance . the left part of the plot",
    "is excluded by the lep limit on @xmath20 ( @xmath55 gev ) .",
    "we also notice that the density of points decreases for large values of @xmath2 .",
    "this reflects the fact that in such large @xmath2 regime , the other parameters ( in particular @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) have to be tuned to limited ranges , in order the bounds from @xmath58 and @xmath24 to be fulfilled .",
    "the orange ( light gray ) points in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhc - tb ] satisfy the constraints of tab .  [",
    "tab : condition ] , except the ones belonging to group ( i ) .",
    "the green ( medium gray ) points give @xmath8 within the experimental range , while the blue ( dark gray ) points satisfy all the constraints , in particular @xmath59 .",
    "the results are consistent with the discussion of the previous section : the interplay between @xmath8 and @xmath59 is such that only either a low @xmath2 region survives or a tuned strip for @xmath60 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : tb - mchi1 ] we show how this can be translated in a bound on the lightest neutralino mass . in the figure ,",
    "the lightest neutralino mass @xmath61 is plotted as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the plot is shaped by the upper and the lower limit on @xmath52 ( from below and above respectively ) .",
    "we see that the requirement of a relic density consistent with wmap makes increase the neutralino mass quite rapidly when @xmath2 decreases , as previously observed in the literature , see for instance @xcite . in particular light neutralinos ( @xmath62 gev )",
    "can be achieved only for large values of @xmath2 . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhc - tb ] , the orange ( light gray ) points do not fulfill the bounds of the group ( i ) , while for the blue ( dark gray ) all constraints are satisfied . we see that in the low @xmath2 region the lightest neutralino mass is bounded to be @xmath63 gev , while for the points lying in the large @xmath2 strip it can be as low as @xmath64 gev .",
    "this last result is consistent with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , despite the fact that in that analysis @xmath59 was not taken into account .",
    "given the relevance in the present discussion of the interplay between @xmath8 and @xmath59 , let us have now a closer look at these observables . in the first row of fig .",

    "then , @xmath33 acquires vanishing small values , corresponding to the charged higgs contribution exactly cancelling the sm contribution . for larger values of @xmath2 ,",
    "the large charged higgs contribution can make @xmath33 to re - enter the allowed range .",
    "however , only a thin strip of points ( the blue / dark gray ones ) close to the boundary are not excluded by the full set of our constraints , in particular @xmath59 .",
    "this can better seen in the second row of fig .",
    "[ fig : rbtn ] , where @xmath59 is plotted versus @xmath2 ( left panel ) and @xmath61 .",

    "the two green ( medium gray ) points regions are allowed by @xmath8 . as discussed above , the one with large @xmath2 ( smaller @xmath61 )",
    "corresponds to the charged higgs contribution overcompensating the sm one .",
    "as we can see , this region is almost excluded by @xmath59 , except for few surviving points with @xmath59 about 2-@xmath65 away from the experimental central value @xmath66  @xcite . in the figure",

    "@xcite , @xmath67 , which would have excluded completely the large @xmath2 region consistent with @xmath8 .",
    "needless to say , an improvement of the experimental determination of @xmath59 or @xmath33 could completely exclude the large @xmath2 region .",
    "this would translate in a lower bound on the lightest neutralino mass at least of @xmath63 gev , as we can see from fig .",

    "finally we comment about the lep neutralino searches , which constrain the pair production cross - section @xmath68  @xcite , and the contribution to the invisible width of the @xmath69 boson of the decay @xmath70",
    "the pair production process is mediated not only by selectron but also @xmath69 boson .",

    "both the @xmath69-mediated contribution of the pair production and the invisible decay width of @xmath69 boson are proportional to the higgsino component in the lightest neutralino . as discussed in sec .",

    "@xcite , the invisible decay width does not give any impact on the limit of the lightest neutralino mass , even considering a less conservative limit @xmath74 .",

    "the light blue ( light gray ) points survive the light and heavy higgs mass constraints of ref .",
    "@xcite , once 3 gev of theoretical uncertainty on the determination of the higgs masses has been taken into account .",
    "the results can be easily interpreted : for an heavier @xmath79 ( @xmath85 gev ) , the decoupling regime is approached , the light higgs gets sm - like and the points with @xmath86 gev are excluded . on the other hand ,",

    "even though the density of points is consistently reduced by the lep limit on higgs masses , we see no relevant modification of the lower bound on the lightest neutralino mass , @xmath88 gev , we found in the large @xmath2 strip . still , it is interesting to notice that a quite light higgs spectrum is predicted within the strip .",

    "we also show the tevatron exclusion @xcite as a gray shaded region .",
    "we see that the large @xmath2 strip is excluded by tevatron experiments only for larger values of @xmath20 and @xmath2 , which correspond to larger @xmath61 , such that the lower bound on the light neutralino mass is not affected .",

    "as we have already discussed , the constraints of group ( i ) have only a mild dependence on susy parameters through susy threshold corrections . on the contrary , the observables of group ( ii ) and the higgs bosons masses depend considerably on susy parameters .    out of the two regions in fig .",

    "the susy contribution to @xmath117 is known to be potentially large and to depend mainly on the slepton and chargino masses , as well as on @xmath2 ( with @xmath118 ) . since @xmath2 and the chargino mass are quite well constrained by the observables we considered , the experimentally allowed range for @xmath119 will turn in a preferred range for @xmath114 .",
    "requiring @xmath119 to result within the 2-@xmath65 range @xmath120\\times 10^{-11}$ ] @xcite , we find for the points lying in the large @xmath2 strip : @xmath121 , where values of the mass below the lower ( above the upper ) limit correspond to a too large ( too small ) susy contribution to @xmath117 . in the case of the low @xmath2 region ,",
    "a contribution large enough to lower the tension below the 2-@xmath65 level clearly requires lighter sleptons .",
    "in fact , we find @xmath122 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the main motivation for studying a light neutralino scenario is provided by the recent unexplained signals reported by some direct searches experiments .",
    "we investigate in this section the elastic scattering cross - section of the neutralino with nucleons for the points of the parameter space that provide a light neutralino and satisfy the above discussed constraints .",
    "we compute the spin - independent scattering cross - section , @xmath123 , by means of the micromegas routine @xcite .",
    "the result is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross - section ] as a function of the neutralino mass . for a comparison ,",
    "we show also in pink the region favored by cogent @xcite , in yellow the region corresponding to the two cdms candidates @xcite .",
    "the dashed line is the 90% c.l .",
    "exclusion reported by xenon10 @xcite .    in interpreting this result",
    ", one should keep in mind that several sources of uncertainties affect the computation of the scattering cross - section on one side and , on the other side , the translation of the experimental results into favored or excluded regions in the wimp mass , scattering cross - section plane . in particular , the uncertainty related to hadronic matrix elements enters the computation of the neutralino - nucleon scattering such that the resulting cross - section can be shifted to about one order of magnitude larger or smaller values @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross - section ] , the default micromegas values for the matrix elements are used . on the other hand",
    ", the constraints from direct searches experiments can be relaxed by a factor 3 in the value of the cross - section by the uncertainties on the local dm density and velocity @xcite .    taking that into account , we notice that the result shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cross - section ] is consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "we see that , out of the two regions satisfying all the constraints , the one with @xmath124 gev gives the largest scattering cross - section , since it corresponds to the ( tuned ) large @xmath2 strip in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhc - tb ] and @xmath123 grows with @xmath2 .",
    "these points are in potential agreement with the regions favored by cogent , cresst and dama ( whose viability has been recently questioned by cdms - ii @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", the low @xmath2 region corresponding to @xmath92 gev gives a neutralino mass range which might be too large for cogent and cresst , and a too small @xmath123 as well .",
    "hence , a confirmation of the hints reported by these experiments would tend to disfavor it .",
    "still , as noticed in @xcite , this region with a slightly heavier neutralino can be consistent with the annual modulation reported by dama and with the two cdms candidate events .",
    "however , taking into account the uncertainties , it seems to be on the edge of the exclusion limit provided by the negative result of xenon10 and xenon100 @xcite . as mentioned above , the experiments are not completely in agreement with each other and the uncertainties are still too large to clarify the situation .",
    "still , it seems likely that the possibility of a light neutralino in the mssm will be fully tested in the next few years by direct dm searches as well .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed the mssm parameter space providing a light neutralino ( @xmath125 gev ) and satisfying all the relevant collider and flavor constraints , as well as the wmap bound on the neutralino relic density .",
    "we found that the request for @xmath54 combined with the constraints from low - energy observable which have no strong dependence on the susy parameters ( but only on the higgs sector parameters ) , in particular @xmath126 and @xmath10 ( @xmath9 ) , select two regions of the parameter space :    * a thin fine - tuned strip with a large value of @xmath2 ( @xmath127 ) and @xmath128 gev , where the neutralino mass can be as light as 8 gev and the direct detection cross - section @xmath129 , so that it might be compatible with the exceeding events reported by cogent and cresst , and the dama annual modulation . * a low @xmath2 ( @xmath130 ) region , where the charged higgs contribution to @xmath126 is not required to overcompensate the sm contribution .",
    "this region gives @xmath92 gev and @xmath131 .    within region",
    "i , which is a strip that barely survives the competing constraints from @xmath132 and @xmath9 , several low - energy observables deviate from the sm predictions and from the experimental central values almost at the 2-@xmath65 level .",
    "this is the case of the susy independent observables of group ( i ) , which then represent a crucial handle to probe this scenario .",
    "moreover , region i provides @xmath112 , a value in the reach of the lhcb experiment in the upcoming months .",
    "finally , heavy higgs searches at the lhc should also probe this large @xmath2 strip with 1 @xmath109 of collected data , i.e. by end of 2011 .",
    "even though it might already appear unlikely , this set - up of the mssm parameters corresponding to a light neutralino ( @xmath62 gev ) is not excluded at present . on the other hand , we can conclude that it will be fully tested in the near future in several independent ways .",
    "region ii should escape such early experimental searches and require more years of data taking .",
    "clearly , it would be the only possible set - up left within the mssm providing a quite light neutralino ( @xmath92 gev ) , in case of a negative result of the experimental tests for region i. the most promising way of probing region ii seems to rely on direct searches experiments . even though the situation is not well established yet ( region ii seems to be disfavored by xenon , but compatible with dama annual modulation and the two cdms candidates ) , there are good perspectives for the experiments currently taking data ( such as xenon100 ) to completely probe that region and , more in general , the light neutralino mssm scenario .",
    "finally , we make a few comments on the recent studies  @xcite . after taking into account the constraints considered in these works as well as @xmath59 and the lep higgs bounds in the way explained in section [ sec : prospects ]",
    ", we find a lower limit for the neutralino mass , @xmath88 gev , which is consistent with the results of ref .",
    "however , the points giving such light neutralinos correspond to a region that survives on a careful balance among the constraints ( especially @xmath8 and @xmath59 ) and consequently requires a tuning of the parameters .",
    "therefore , if one considers slightly more stringent allowed ranges for the constraints , this region might disappear , as it seems to be the case of ref .  @xcite . hence ,",
    "the lower limit , @xmath92 gev , of the low @xmath2 region seems to be more robust .",
    "we are grateful to g.  blanger , a.  j.  buras , g.  isidori , j.  jones - perez , f.  mahmoudi and p.  paradisi for useful discussions or communications , and to j.  redondo for his continuous moral support and encouragement .",
    "one of us ( y.  t. ) wishes to thank max - planck - institute fr physik for very warm hospitality during the preparation of this work .",
    "after the completion of this work , the cms collaboration released the first results of the search for neutral higgs bosons in the channel @xmath133 , based on an integrated luminosity of 36 @xmath134 @xcite . since no excess has been observed , they pose an upper bound on @xmath2 ( @xmath135 for @xmath136 gev ) , which , even taking into account theoretical uncertainties , disfavors the large @xmath2 strip discussed in this paper ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "if this result will be confirmed , this would represent the first test excluding the large @xmath2 region , as we discussed in section [ sec : prospects ] . in this case",
    ", the only low @xmath2 region would remain viable , corresponding to a lower bound on the lightest neutralino mass of @xmath92 gev .",
