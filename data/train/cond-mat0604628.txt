    "owing to their intriguing and complex behaviour , colloidal dispersions in liquid crystals have been the subject of numerous studies in recent years @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of these inverted emulsions depends upon ( i ) the elastic constants of the liquid crystal , ( ii ) the size and shape of the colloidal particles , ( iii ) the surface tension and ( iv ) the boundary conditions at the surface of the container .",
    "these contributions lead to highly anisotropic long - ranged colloidal interactions @xcite that result in a variety of self - organised colloidal structures , such as linear chains @xcite , periodic lattices @xcite , anisotropic clusters @xcite , and cellular structures @xcite stabilized , in general , by the presence of topological defects .    the competition of elastic and surface energies may also determine the shape of nematic droplets @xcite . indeed , for sufficiently large parallel anchoring , nematic droplets were found to exhibit sharp ends @xcite .",
    "these shapes are known as tactoids and the tactoidal shape is more pronounced for smaller droplets . as the size of the droplet increases , the contribution of the isotropic surface tension also increases and , as a result , the shape of the droplets becomes spheroidal @xcite .",
    "recent studies on the shape of isotropic soft colloids in a nematic liquid crystal illustrate this behaviour and reveal a way of controlling the shape of the droplets using surfactants @xcite .    freely standing smectic films ( sm fsf s ) are two - dimensional systems obtained by spreading a smectic liquid crystal through a hole drilled into a substrate .",
    "these films are useful systems to study surface interactions , effects of reduced dimensionality on liquid crystal phase transitions @xcite , and interactions between soft colloids @xcite .",
    "soft colloids or inclusions are created by ( i ) rapid reduction of the film area , ( ii ) blowing across the film to pull material from the meniscus region or ( iii ) heating the system near the smectic - to - isotropic or smectic - to - nematic phase transition @xcite .",
    "the thickness of sm fsf s ranges from a few thousand down to two smectic layers .",

    "experimental studies on the ordering of soft colloids in sm-@xmath0 fsf report that the molecules in the liquid crystal matrix are aligned perpendicular to the colloidal surfaces , nucleating one hyperbolic topological defect close to the colloidal surfaces @xcite .",
    "by contrast , experiments on sm-@xmath5 fsf report that the liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel to the colloidal surfaces @xcite . under these conditions , a pair of defects may be nucleated at the poles of the colloidal particles which , in turn , affect the colloidal shape as reported by cluzeau et al @xcite .",

    "<S> we will focus on elliptical soft colloids and determine how their equilibrium shapes depend on the elastic constants of the liquid crystal , the anchoring strength , the surface tension and the size of the colloids . </S>",
    "<S> a shape diagram is obtained analytically , by minimizing the frank elastic free energy , in the limit of small eccentricities . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical results are verified , and generalized to arbitrary eccentricities , by numerical minimization of an appropriate landau free energy . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is required for an adequate description of the topological defects when the liquid crystal correlation length is comparable to the size of the colloidal particles . </S>"
