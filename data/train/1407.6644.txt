    "we use a mode - locked ti : sapphire laser emitting a train of 786 nm picosecond pulses at a repetition rate of 80 mhz for producing the input coherent states @xmath15 and , after frequency doubling to 393 nm , as the pump for degenerate , non - collinear , parametric down - conversion in a 3-mm long @xmath51-barium borate crystal .",
    "we obtain stimulated pdc by synchronously seeding the crystal with the coherent state pulses along the signal mode .",
    "heralded photon addition in such a mode is conditioned on a single photon detection by an avalanche photodiode ( spcm ) placed in the idler mode after narrow spectral and spatial filters ( see @xcite ) .    for the orthogonalizer and cv qubit realization based on the photon creation operator and schematically depicted in fig.[fig : setup]a , we need to make the clicks of the spcm due to photon addition indistinguishable from those coming from an ancillary coherent state @xmath27 . differently from the conceptual scheme shown in the figure",
    ", we do nt combine the modes on a beam splitter , but rather make use of the polarization degrees of freedom .",
    "the ancillary coherent state pulses @xmath27 are originated from the same laser pulse train and injected along the pdc idler channel with an horizontal polarization . since we exploit type - i parametric down - conversion with an horizontally - polarized pump , such an idler injection does not contribute to stimulated emission , nor it interferes with the vertically - polarized seed @xmath15 coherent pulses injected along the signal mode . by placing a polarizer , slightly rotated from the vertical position , in front of the spcm we can adjust the relative weight of the photon addition and identity operations in the operator superposition .",
    "their relative phase is controlled and actively locked by translating a mirror mounted on a piezoelectric transducer in the path of the @xmath27 pulses .",
    "the experimental setup used for the orthogonalizer based on the photon number operator and schematically depicted in fig.[fig : setupn]a is based on that first used for the implementation of the commutator operator @xcite .",
    "it relies on the coherent superposition of two inverted sequences of photon creation and annihilation operators by means of a beam - splitter ( bs ) that mixes the heralding modes of the two photon - subtraction operations .",
    "a coincidence between the clicks from two single - photon detectors , one at the output of the beam - splitter , and the other on the herald mode of the photon addition stage placed between the two subtraction ones , certifies that a sequence of photon addition and subtraction has certainly taken place , but leaves their order unknown . by adjusting the beam - splitter reflectivity and the relative phase between the two subtraction herald modes , a generic superposition of the two sequences like in eq.[eq : ortho_aa ]",
    "can thus be realized .",
    "the relative weights between the two inverted sequences of operations is then properly adjusted according to the mean photon number of the input states .",
    "the conditionally generated output states are finally analyzed by means of a high - frequency , time - domain homodyne detector @xcite triggered by single spcm clicks in the case of the scheme utilizing the photon creation operator or coincidences between the clicks from two spcm detectors ( one for photon addition and one for a delocalized photon subtraction ) in the photon number operator case .",
    "a set of orthogonal states may be constructed by repeated application of the operator @xmath52 to @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , the result will be the same for @xmath53 , and on to states of form @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "thus with this operation we can construct a set of mutually orthogonal states .",
    "we now consider the theoretical implementation of the scheme in fig.[fig : setup]a , which generates the operation of @xmath56 .",
    "the pdc operation is to add a photon to @xmath57 , heralded by a photon generated in the second mode @xcite . including the beam - splitting operation between this second mode and the coherent state @xmath58 , the total operation is represented by @xmath59 , where the input @xmath57 is in the same mode as the bosonic operators @xmath60 and @xmath61 . here",
    ", @xmath62 is the beam - splitter operator @xcite , which acts on coherent states mixed with the vacuum as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the reflectivity and transmittivity of the beam - splitter .",
    "the final step in this method is to project the expression onto @xmath66 , yielding @xmath67 up to an overall global phase which is omitted to better see the similarity of the result to operator @xmath56 . using the unitary transformation by @xmath31 of @xmath61 @xcite and eq .",
    "[ eq : orthoalpha ] , it is straightforward to see @xmath68 thus @xmath69 for any @xmath70 .",
    "such an expression may also be produced for the photon number operator @xmath71 , where ideally the operator is @xmath72 , with @xmath42 the mean photon number .",
    "this approach , described in fig.[fig : setupn ] , begins with the expression @xmath73 where this time it is noted that @xmath74 . following the measurement again of @xmath66 , the resulting expression , up to a phase , is @xmath75 where @xmath76 can be set to equal @xmath42 with the appropriate adjustment of the beam - splitter .",
