    "cleo observed a surprisingly large branching fraction for the decay @xmath5 at large momenta of the @xmath3 meson @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "babar @xcite later obtained @xmath7 .",
    "this @xmath3 momentum is beyond the end point for most @xmath8 decays , so the @xmath3 yield from @xmath9 is expected to be only of the order of @xmath10 .",
    "predictions assuming factorization @xcite estimate the charmless component of this branching fraction to be also about @xmath10 .",
    "thus conventional calculations can not account for the measured rate and they also fail to predict the right shape for the @xmath3 momentum spectrum @xcite .",
    "these findings motivated intense theoretical activity because new physics could account for such an enhancement .",
    "however , standard model explanations have also been proposed .",
    "for example , atwood and soni @xcite argued that the observed excess is due to an enhanced @xmath11 penguin diagram , complemented by a strong @xmath12 coupling , induced by the gluonic content of the @xmath3 wave function .",

    "different assumptions on the form factor dependence have been proposed @xcite .",
    "while argus was the first experiment to study the inclusive @xmath30 production at the @xmath1 @xcite , they did not have enough data to separate @xmath31 from the other components discussed below .",
    "cleo ii @xcite was the first experiment to have sufficient statistics to measure inclusive @xmath3 production from the subprocess @xmath31 .",
    "these data ruled out a class of form factors characterized by a very weak @xmath13 dependence @xcite .",
    "subsequently , several theoretical calculations @xcite derived the perturbative qcd form factors from models of the @xmath30 wave function .",
    "attempts to use cleo ii data to constrain the model parameters @xcite were not conclusive , due to the limited statistics at the end point of the @xmath3 spectrum .",
    "thus , it was difficult to establish whether neglecting higher order terms in the perturbative expansion was appropriate @xcite .",
    "an improved measurement , based on a higher - statistics sample , is important to provide an improved determination of the qcd parameters , and , consequently , a more stringent test of the theory .",

    "the cleo iii detector includes a high - resolution charged particle tracking system @xcite , a csi electromagnetic calorimeter @xcite , and a ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) hadron identification system @xcite .",
    "the csi calorimeter measures the photon energies with a resolution of 2.2% at @xmath35 gev and 5% at @xmath36=100 mev .",

    "the branching fractions for these processes are ( 44.5@xmath401.4)% and ( 39.38@xmath400.26)% @xcite respectively .",
    "we identify single photons based on their shower shape .",
    "the photon four - vectors are constrained to have invariant mass equal to the nominal @xmath41 mass .",
    "subsequently , @xmath41 candidates are combined with two oppositely charged tracks to form an @xmath3 .",
    "loose @xmath42 consistency criteria based on @xmath37 measurements are applied to the charged tracks .",
    "the gluonic @xmath3 production at the @xmath1 is expected to be dominant only at very high @xmath13 , or , equivalently , at high @xmath3 scaled energy @xmath43 , where @xmath43 is defined as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the @xmath3 energy and @xmath46 is the beam energy . enhanced @xmath3 production at high @xmath43 would indicate a large @xmath47 coupling .    for low - energy @xmath3 mesons , photons coming from low energy @xmath48s",
    "are a severe source of background .",
    "thus a @xmath49 veto is applied for @xmath50 , whereby photon pairs that have an invariant mass consistent within 2.5 @xmath51 with the nominal @xmath49 mass are not included as the candidate photons for @xmath41 reconstruction .",
