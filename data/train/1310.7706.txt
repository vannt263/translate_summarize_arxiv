    "entanglement swapping @xcite is a procedure to create entanglement between two qubits which have never directly interacted with each other , and has been demonstrated experimentally by pan _ _  et al . _ _ @xcite .",

    "very recently , the notion of delayed - choice entanglement swapping was experimentally demonstrated by ma _",
    "et al_. @xcite , an idea first considered in peres @xcite and cohen s cohen gedanken experiments .",
    "the intriguing feature of this mechanism is that the entanglement is made ` a posteriori ' , after the entangled qubits have been measured .",

    "et al_. @xcite combined the concept of teleportation and a common environment and proposed a method to teleport charge qubits via a common reservoir using the super - radiance effect .",
    "the necessary bell - state measurements are performed naturally by the collective decay , i.e. the sub- and superradiance channels @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the fidelity and the success probability was further examined @xcite using the quantum trajectory method .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a scheme to accomplish entanglement swapping via collective decay , effectively swapping the entanglement between two atoms into entanglement between two distant cavities .",
    "the steering inequality steering is utilized to verify the non - local properties of the final state obtained between the two distant cavities .",
    "we further point out that the unsuccessful outcomes , naturally occurring from the superradiance effect we employ here , may be useful in a delayed - choice entanglement - swapping experiment .",

    "armed with this , we now propose how to accomplish the entanglement swapping protocol through such collective decay processes .",
    "we first consider two identical two - level atoms each passing through a separate cavity , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . at this stage",
    "the atom - cavity system 1 and atom - cavity system 2 are well separated from each other . in the strong atom - cavity coupling regime",
    "the interactions between the atoms and their respective cavities can be written as @xcite @xmath4where @xmath5 or @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the atom - cavity coupling strength , @xmath8 and the pauli matrices @xmath9 are the cavity photon and the atom operators respectively . with the appropriate preparation of the initial states and control of the passage times through the cavities ,",

    "@xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) represent the @xmath11-th cavity with no ( one ) photon and the @xmath11-th atom in its excited ( ground ) state , respectively .",
    "our goal is to use these entangled atom - cavity states and the phenomena of collective decay , as well as post - selection , to perform entanglement swapping and entangle the photonic states of the two distant cavities . to achieve this ,",
    "the next step is to remove the atoms from the cavities and trap the two atoms close together so that they experience superradiant collective - decay processes in the common electromagnetic environment .",
    "this is a collective decay phenomenon which is enhanced when the inter - atom distance is much shorter than the wavelength of the emitted photon .",
    "one can also have a similar enhanced effect by placing the two atoms at the anti - nodes of a cavity @xcite .",
    "before the collective decay occurs , the total wavefunction of the combined atom - cavity systems can be written as @xmath16 \\notag \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\left| 0\\right\\rangle _ { c,1}\\left| 0\\right\\rangle _ { c,2}\\otimes \\left| t_{1}\\right\\rangle _ { 12}+\\left| 1\\right\\rangle _ { c,1}\\left| 1\\right\\rangle _ { c,2}\\otimes \\left| t_{-1}\\right\\rangle _ { 12}\\right .   \\notag \\\\ & & \\left .",

    "if the measurement outcome is a single photon , i.e. via either @xmath21 or @xmath20 , then entanglement swapping can be achieved , provided that the sub- and super - radiant decay can be distinguished . as pointed out in ref .",
    "[ ] , the momentum of the emitted photon @xmath22  depends on the separation of the two atoms @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24  @xmath23  @xmath25  or @xmath26  corresponds to the emission of a super- or sub - radiant photon , respectively .",
    "therefore , to distinguish between the sub- and super - radiant photons one can place the detectors at the appropriate angles .",

    "an additional advantage here , over that of a scheme based on purely photonic degrees of freedom , is that we can make use of other internal metastable states of the atoms to postpone the collective decay ( fig .",

    "one first lets the atom @xmath106 pass through the cavity , and as it does so the cavity plays the role of cavity @xmath109 in the above scheme .",
    "after the atom @xmath106 has exited the cavity and is trapped , and its state has been transferred to an internal metastable state , one then performs a measurement on the photonic state in the cavity @xmath109 and records the data .",
    "the next step is to ` reset ' the cavity and let atom @xmath6 pass through it , so that the cavity now plays the role of the cavity @xmath107 .",
    "when atom @xmath6 arrives at the trap , the atom @xmath106 is transferred back to its original state so that the collective decay can occur .",
    "then , a measurement is again performed on the cavity @xmath107 .    following",
    "the above procedure one can obtain the violation of the steering inequality and may have the illusion of `` self - entanglement '' since the measurement data is produced by the same cavity .",
    "however , this is not the case because when we reset the cavity , it ( of course ) becomes a new system .",
    "the use of a single cavity simplifies a possible experimental implementation and emphasizes the fact that the relative temporal order of the three observers events is irrelevant @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a scheme to accomplish entanglement swapping via superradiance .",
    "we outlined how the swapping protocol could be combined with collective decay to entangle two distant cavities . after post - selection and averaging over all single - photon events ,",
    "the non - local properties of the two - cavity state were analyzed by both the steering and bell - chsh inequalities .",
    "we found that the steering inequality has a better tolerance in verifying the non - local properties of the swapping state .",
    "furthermore , we have also pointed out that the unsuccessful events in our scheme can be used in a delayed - choice entanglement swapping protocol .",
