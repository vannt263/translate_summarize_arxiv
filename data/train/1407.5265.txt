    "single - molecule magnets ( smms )  @xcite have been proposed as candidates for applications in molecular spintronics .",
    "@xcite especially enticing is the prospect of using an individual smm as a base component of a spintronic circuit which would be capable of storing @xcite or processing @xcite classical and quantum information . in general",
    ", the essential prerequisite for this is a magnetic bistability which in smms stems from a large molecular spin and a strong _ easy - axis _ magnetic anisotropy , given by a parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this tends to fix the spin along an axis determined by the molecular structure , without favoring any specific direction along this axis . in consequence ,",
    "an energy barrier @xmath2 protects the spin of the molecule against reversal between the two opposite , energetically degenerate orientations . from this point of view",
    ", detection of the additional _ transverse _ magnetic anisotropy , characterized by the parameter @xmath3 in the hamiltonian @xmath4 , is crucially important .",
    "such transverse anisotropy can impair the bistability by opening under - barrier quantum tunneling channels for spin reversal .",
    "@xcite these quantum tunneling processes are also of fundamental interest since the spin - dynamics displays    hitherto , most techniques aiming to extract the transverse anisotropy parameter @xmath5 are based on the detection of the tunnel splittings it induces , which display a characteristic magnetic field dependence .",
    "@xcite the major challenge for all such approaches is that these splittings are complicated functions of @xmath5 , and even more , the splitting for high - spin states and low magnetic fields are smaller than the parameter @xmath5 itself by several orders of magnitude . using landau - zener spectroscopy",
    "the tunnel splittings have been accurately determined in bulk fe@xmath6 by measuring their pronounced berry - phase oscillations .",
    "@xcite also in bulk crystals and solutions of smms the parameter @xmath5 has been established by different methods , such as high - frequency electron paramagnetic resonance  @xcite and inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "@xcite these methods , however , probe large assemblies of molecules , and thus are not designed for investigating the magnetic properties of an individual smm . as a result , little is known about the transverse anisotropy of individual smms in spintronic devices .",
    "in this paper we propose an approach for extracting the parameter @xmath5 of a single molecule by employing electronic transport measurements .",
    "we study a fe@xmath0 smm captured in a gateable junction ( for details see app .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] ) a geometry close to envisaged device structures which is a unique tool for addressing the spin in different redox states of a molecule .",
    "@xcite we show that , as a consequence of the mixing of the spin eigenstates of the smm , the transverse anisotropy significantly manifests itself in transport .",
    "in particular , we predict and experimentally observe characteristic variations of the coulomb peak _ amplitude _ with the magnetic field from which the parameter @xmath5 can be estimated .",
    "importantly , the method proposed here works at temperatures and electron tunnel broadenings @xmath7 exceeding @xmath5 by many orders of magnitude , while @xmath5 in its turn much exceeds the tunnel splittings .",
    "a scheme of a three - terminal smm junction is shown in fig .  [ fig_1](a ) .",
    "an smm bridges the source and drain gold electrodes .",
    "an underlying aluminium electrode separated by a few nanometers of aluminium oxide allows for electrical gating of the molecule and , thus , accessing different redox states , see also app .",

    "[ fig_1](c ) shows the standard signatures of sequential electron tunneling ( set ) through a molecule with two competing charge states tuned by a gate voltage .",
    "@xcite strong high - conductance resonance lines separate adjacent charge - stable coulomb blockade regions , labeled @xmath15 and @xmath16 , from the set regions where transport is possible .",
    "importantly , several fingerprint features of the stable fe@xmath0 smm can be identified : ( i ) high charging energies expected for an individual molecule ; ( ii ) a strong set excitation at approximately 4.8 mev ,  @xcite specific to fe@xmath0 as it corresponds to the predicted transition energy between the ground ( @xmath19 ) and the first - excited ( @xmath20 ) spin multiplets for the neutral molecule ;  @xcite ( iii ) a non - linear shift of the degeneracy peak in the presence of magnetic field as described by gate - voltage spectroscopy ( for details see ref .  [ ] and",
    "[ sec : gate - voltage_position ] ) .",
    "moreover , depending on the strength of tunnel coupling  @xmath7 , split kondo zero - bias anomalies in coulomb blockade regimes of _ subsequent _ charge states can be observed , which show the zero - field splitting ( zfs ) at the values expected for the fe@xmath0 smm .",
    "@xcite these features also indicate that the molecule is in an intermediate coupling regime with the electrodes , with its upper - limit estimated to be @xmath7=1.6 mev",

    "[ sec : gate - voltage_position ] .",
    "in a magnetic field the position of the coulomb peak ( cp ) depends both on the _ magnitude _ and the _ orientation _ of an external magnetic field @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite in short , the cp marks the transition between the ground states of two spin multiplets , with spin values @xmath21 and @xmath22 , for the two neighboring charge states .",
    "the energy difference between these states is then a function of @xmath8 , and in particular , it translates into a shift of the linear response degeneracy point in @xmath13 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](d ) .",
    "from such a shift one can infer that the ground spin - multiplets of the two charge states evolve differently in the applied field ; therefore , the shift provides information about the magnetic properties of the system .",
    "for example , in simple quantum dots the shift corresponds just to the _ linear _ zeeman effect which is _",
    "isotropic_.  @xcite on the other hand , for magnetically anisotropic molecules , like the smms discussed here , not only does the cp shift depend on the relative sample - field orientation , allowing us to extract the value of the angle @xmath9 , but it also provides information about the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy  ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "@xcite however , the gate - voltage position of the peak , determined by the low - energy spectrum , is insensitive to the small tunnel splitting corrections induced by the transverse magnetic anisotropy .",
    "below we show that information about the transverse magnetic anisotropy  ( @xmath5 ) can instead be inferred from a nonmonotonic dependence of the peak _ amplitude _ @xmath23 , such as in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](d ) , which relies on transition probabilities between different spin  states .",
    "we have measured around 200 junctions of which 17 showed clear molecular signatures . from those , 9 samples displayed a clear coulomb peak suitable to perform gate spectroscopy and a magnetic field modulation of @xmath23 .",

    "interestingly , @xmath32 for the two samples exhibits a significantly different behavior .",

    "finally , worth of note is the larger - than - predicted modulation of the cp amplitude observed in the experiments .",

    "first , the master equation analysis was constrained to a weak tunnel - coupling @xmath7 as compared to temperature .",
    "we verified that higher - order tunnel processes that lead to broadening and inelastic tunneling do not increase the scale of the modulation of the cp height .",
    "for this we employed a perturbative approach including next - to - leading tunneling processes  @xcite and non - perturbative numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method .",
    "@xcite second , we assumed symmetric tunnel - coupling of the smm to both electrodes with the same energy @xmath7 .",
    "one can show that a junction asymmetry gives rise to an overall constant factor suppressing the conductance @xmath23 .",
    "thus , this can not change its field dependence .",
    "third , the addition of higher - order magnetic anisotropy terms to the smm model ,  eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_n ] ) , is also not likely to affect the magnitude of the modulation .",
    "we checked , for instance , the effect of the 4th order transverse anisotropy of the form @xmath77      $ ] , for a range of values of the parameter @xmath78 for which this term competes with the 2nd order transverse term . we thus conclude that the intensity of the modulation may rely on some intrinsic amplification mechanism not captured by our model , i.e. , going beyond the giant - spin model ,  @xcite when considering a single electron interacting with the molecule .",
    "we summarize here in a few steps how to determine magnetic anisotropy of an individual smm ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : h_smm])-([eq : h_n ] ) and app .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) by exploiting the information contained both in the coulomb peak _ position _ as well as in the magnetic field evolution of its _ amplitude_. in particular , the method under discussion allows for finding both the magnetic anisotropy constants @xmath79 and @xmath80 in two charge states ( i.e. for @xmath66 ) of an smm , and the orientation of an external magnetic field relative to the molecule s principle axes , given by the angles @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "a.   let us first consider only the coulomb peak _ position _ , shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] . as explained in ref .",
    "[ ] , by analyzing the position of the coulomb peak one can immediately conclude whether a molecule captured in the junction exhibits magnetic anisotropy at all . if the molecule is _ spin - isotropic _ , one observes a linear dependence on the magnetic field [ see dashed line in figs .",
    "[ fig_5](a)-(b ) ] that reflects the linear zeeman effect . on the other hand , if the molecule is _ spin - anisotropic _ , this dependence becomes nonlinear , and the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy parameter @xmath79 together with the angle @xmath9 can be estimated from it .",
    "this , in turn , permits for systematic adjustment of the magnetic field s orientation so that the field is kept perpendicular to the molecule s easy axis @xmath81 , which corresponds to @xmath25 . b.   the transverse magnetic anisotropy breaks the molecule s rotational symmetry around the easy axis @xmath81 ( see also app .",
