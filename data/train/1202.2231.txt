    "gaussian interference channel ( gic ) is a basic mathematical model that characterizes many real - life interference - limited communication systems .",
    "the information - theoretic study on the gic has a long history , but the capacity region of the gic still remains unknown in general , even for the two - user case .",
    "the best achievable rate region for the two - user gic to date was established by han and kobayashi in @xcite , which utilizes rate splitting at transmitters , joint decoding at receivers , and time sharing among codebooks .",
    "this achievable rate region was recently proven to be within 1-bit of the capacity region of the gic in @xcite . however , capacity - approaching techniques in general require non - linear multi - user encoding and decoding , which may not be suitable for practical systems . a more pragmatic approach that leads to suboptimal achievable rates",
    "is to allow only single - user encoding and decoding by treating the interference from all other unintended users as additive gaussian noise . for this approach",
    ", the key design challenge lies in how to optimally allocate transmit resources such as power , bandwidth , and antenna beam among different users to minimize the network performance loss due to their mutual interference .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the circularly symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg ) distribution for the transmitted signals is in general non - optimal for the rate maximization in gic with the interference treated as noise . by means of symbol extensions over time and/or asymmetric complex signaling , the weighted sum - rate ( wsr ) of gic can be further improved .",
    "however , to our best knowledge , applying such techniques will result in more complicated wsr maximization problems , for which how to obtain the globally optimal solutions still remains an open problem , even for the case of @xmath1-user gic .",
    "thus , for simplicity , in this paper we adopt the conventional assumption for the gic that the transmitted signals have an independent cscg distribution over time .",
    "the research on the gic with interference treated as noise has recently drawn significant attention due to the advance in cooperative inter - cell interference ( ici ) management for cellular networks . traditionally , most of the studies on resource allocation for cellular networks focus on the single - cell setup , while the ici experienced by a receiver in one cell caused by the transmitters in other cells is minimized by means of frequency reuse , which avoids the same frequency band to be used by adjacent cells . however , most beyond-3 g wireless systems advocate to increase the frequency reuse factor and even allow it to be one or so - called `` universal frequency reuse '' , due to which the issue of ici becomes more crucial .",
    "consequently , joint resource allocation across neighboring cells becomes a practically appealing approach for managing the ici .",
    "if the mobile stations ( mss ) in each cell are separated for transmission in frequency via orthogonal frequency - division multiple - access ( ofdma ) or in time via time - division multiple - access ( tdma ) , then the active links in different cells transmitting at the same frequency tone or in the same time slot will interfere with each other , which can be modeled by a gic . more specifically ,",
    "if the base stations ( bs ) and mss are each equipped with one single antenna , the system can be modeled as the single - input single - output ( siso ) gic , termed as siso - ic . if the bss are each equipped with multiple antennas while mss are each equipped with one single antenna , then in the uplink the system can be modeled as the single - input multiple - output ( simo ) gic , termed as simo - ic , and in the downlink as the multiple - input single - input ( miso ) gic , termed as miso - ic .",
    "the achievable rate region of siso - ic , simo - ic or miso - ic , with the single - user detection ( sud ) by treating the interference as gaussian noise , is in general a non - convex set due to the coupled interference among users . as a result , how to efficiently find",
    "the optimal power control and/or beamforming solutions to achieve the maximum wsr for different types of gics is a challenging problem .",
    "it is worth noting that a great deal of valuable scholarly work @xcite-@xcite has contributed to resolving this problem . for siso - ic ,",
    "various efficient power control schemes have been studied .",
    "the authors in @xcite showed that in the two - user case the optimal power allocation to the sum - rate maximization problem is `` binary '' , i.e. , either one user transmits with full power and the other user shuts down , or both users transmit with full power .",
    "however , this result does not hold in general when the number of users is greater than two .",
    "based on game theory , an `` asynchronous distributed pricing ( adp ) '' algorithm was proposed in @xcite whereby locally optimal solutions can be obtained for wsr maximization . in @xcite , the wsr maximization problem was transformed into a signomial programming ( sp ) problem , which was efficiently solved by constructing a series of geometric programming ( gp ) problems through the approach of successive convex approximation . similar to adp , this algorithm only guarantees locally optimal solutions . as for the case of parallel siso - ic , the authors in @xcite , @xcite showed that the duality gap for the wsr maximization problem is zero when the number of parallel gics becomes asymptotically large . as a result , the lagrange duality method can be applied to decouple the problem into parallel sub - problems in the dual domain .",
    "however , the power optimization in each sub - problem for a given gic is still non - convex . for an extensive survey of power control algorithms for siso - ic",
    ", please refer to @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for miso - ic , the optimality of transmit beamforming for achieving the maximum wsr with sud has been proven in @xcite . in @xcite , the complete characterization of all pareto optimal rates for miso - ic was studied . to maximize the wsr ,",
    "an iterative algorithm was proposed in @xcite from an egotistic versus altruistic viewpoint , and other `` price - based '' algorithms ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) were also developed .",
    "however , these algorithms in general can not achieve the global wsr maximum for miso - ic .",
    "different from the above prior work in which the power and/or beamforming vectors were optimized directly for wsr maximization in the gic , in this paper we propose a new approach that maximizes the wsr in the achievable rate region of the gic directly .",
    "this approach is based on the following two key observations : @xmath2 the wsr is a strictly increasing function with respect to individual user rates ; and @xmath3 the achievable rate region is a `` normal '' set @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the wsr maximization problem for the gic belongs to the class of optimization problems so - called monotonic optimization over a normal set , for which the global optimality can be achieved by an iterative `` outer polyblock approximation '' algorithm @xcite .",
    "however , one challenging requirement of this algorithm is a unique characterization of the pareto boundary of the achievable rate region since at each iteration of the algorithm one particular point on the pareto boundary that corresponds to the maximum achievable sum - rate in a prescribed direction needs to be determined .",
    "this problem is efficiently solved in this paper by utilizing a so - called `` rate profile '' approach @xcite , which transforms the original problem into a sequence of signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) feasibility problems .",
    "it is also shown in this paper that such feasibility problems can be efficiently solved by existing techniques for various types of gics .",
    "it is worth noting that rate profile was first proposed in @xcite as an alternative method to wsr maximization for characterizing the pareto boundary of the capacity region for the multi - antenna gaussian multiple - access channel ( mac ) , which is a convex set .",
    "this method was later applied to characterize the pareto boundary of non - convex rate regions for the miso - ic in @xcite and the two - way multi - antenna relay channel in @xcite , for which the wsr maximization approach is not directly applicable . a very similar idea",
    "to rate profile was also proposed in @xcite , where the proportional rate fairness is imposed as a constraint for wsr maximization in multi - user ofdm systems . as for the outer polyblock approximation algorithm ,",
    "it was first proposed in @xcite , and later applied in @xcite and @xcite to solve the wsr maximization problems for the gic . in @xcite ,",
    "this algorithm was applied for siso - ic together with the generalized linear fractional programming , which , however , can not be extended to simo - ic or miso - ic . in @xcite ,",
    "this algorithm was applied to the two - user miso - ic by exploiting a prior result in @xcite that the optimal transmit beamforming vector to achieve any pareto boundary rate - pair can be expressed as a linear combination of the zero - forcing ( zf ) and maximum - ratio transmission ( mrt ) beamformers .",
    "however , this result only holds for the two - user miso - ic and thus how to extend the algorithm in @xcite to miso - ic with more than two users remains unknown . in comparison , in this paper we show that by jointly utilizing the outer polyblock approximation algorithm and rate profile approach , the global optimality of the wsr maximization problem can be achieved for all siso - ic , simo - ic and miso - ic , with arbitrary number of users .",
    "it is also worth noting that for the wsr maximization in siso - ic , besides @xcite that applies the outer polyblock approximation algorithm , there have been other algorithms developed based on the branch and bound method .",
    "for example , in @xcite and @xcite , branch and bound methods combined with difference of convex functions ( dc ) programming have been proposed .",
    "a generalized branch and bound method applicable to problems in which the objective function can not be expressed in the form of dc , has also been proposed in @xcite . in this paper , we propose an alternative approach to that in the above prior work , whereby the wsr maximization problems for siso - ic , simo - ic , and miso - ic are all solvable .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "we assume that there are @xmath274 users , i.e. , @xmath275 , and there is a minimum rate constraint for each user with @xmath276 , @xmath37 .",
    "we set the parameters to control the accuracy of algorithm [ table1 ] as @xmath277 and @xmath278 .",

    "[ fig3 ] shows the convergence of algorithm [ table1 ] under the above channel setup .",
    "it is observed that this algorithm takes about @xmath281 iterations to converge .",
    "the converged sum - rate is @xmath282 with users individual rates given by @xmath283 $ ] . to verify that the global sum - rate maximum is achieved ,",
    "we compare the obtained maximum sum - rate with that by an exhaustive search , which is equal to @xmath284 .",
    "thus , algorithm [ table1 ] does achieve the global optimality of sum - rate maximization within a guaranteed error @xmath285 , which is smaller than the set threshold @xmath278 .",
    "next , we consider a siso - ic with stronger cross - user interference channel gains than those given in ( [ equ : channel gain ] ) by keeping all diagonal elements of @xmath286 unchanged , but scaling all off - diagonal elements by @xmath287 times . as",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , for this new channel setup , algorithm [ table1 ] takes about @xmath288 iterations to converge .",
    "the converged sum - rate in this case is @xmath289 with users individual rates given by @xmath290 $ ] , while that obtained by the exhaustive search is @xmath291 .",
    "thus , as compared to the previous case with weaker interference channel gains , the global optimality for sum - rate maximization is achieved in this case with a much slower convergence .",
    "the reason is as follows . with stronger interference channel gains ,",
    "the optimal power allocation for sum - rate maximization is more likely to render some users transmit at their minimum required rates ( e.g. , user @xmath26 and user @xmath292 in this example ) .",
    "hence , the corresponding optimal rate values will lie in the strip defined by @xmath293 for some @xmath25 s .",
    "since in algorithm [ table1 ] each new polyblock is generated from the previous one by cutting off some unfit portions , the cuts become shallower and shallower as @xmath93 approaches the above strip .",
    "this can be observed from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that after the @xmath294th iteration , the best intersection point @xmath112 has never changed .",
    "however , to make @xmath121 hold , another @xmath295 iterations are taken just to reduce the value of @xmath105 . since",
    "this reduction becomes very inefficient near the strip , the algorithm converges much more slowly to the desired accuracy with the increasing of interference channel gains . from this observation",
    ", we infer that the values of @xmath119 and @xmath111 need to be properly set to balance between the accuracy and convergence speed of our proposed algorithm .",
    "next , we give another example to illustrate the important role of parameter @xmath119 in balancing between the accuracy and convergence speed of our proposed algorithm .",
    "we assume that @xmath296 , and there are no minimum rate requirements for the users .",
    "we consider the following channel matrix:@xmath297,\\end{aligned}\\]]with @xmath280 . by an exhaustive search ,",
    "the optimal sum - rate is obtained as @xmath298 with users individual rates given by @xmath299 $ ] .",
    ".selection of @xmath119 on the performance of the proposed algorithm [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ table5 ] shows the convergence speed and the converged sum - rate of our proposed algorithm for different values of @xmath119 with @xmath300 .",
    "we observe that as @xmath119 increases , the algorithm convergence speed improves rapidly , but the converged sum - rate decreases .",
    "when @xmath301 , the difference between the optimal sum - rate and converged sum - rate is @xmath302 , which is even larger than @xmath300 .",
    "this is because that as we show in section [ subsec : algorithm ] , with non - zero @xmath119 , we are in fact solving problem p2-a instead of the original problem p2 .",
    "consequently , the proposed algorithm can only guarantee that the difference between the maximum sum - rate of problem p2-a and the converged sum - rate is less than @xmath111 , but not necessarily for problem p2 .",
    "thus , if the value of @xmath119 is selected to be too large such that all the @xmath111-optimal solutions lie in the excluded strips , the difference of the converged sum - rate and the maximum sum - rate of problem ( p2 ) will be larger than @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath119 should be carefully selected based on the value of @xmath111 . in this numerical example , we can select @xmath303 such that the @xmath111-optimal solution is still guaranteed and also the converged speed is reasonably fast .      a key application of our proposed algorithm is to provide performance benchmarks for other heuristic algorithms for achieving the maximum wsr in the gic , especially in cases of miso - ic and simo - ic where the globally optimal solution by exhaustive search is hardly possible . in the following , we provide an example to show how to utilize our proposed algorithm to evaluate the performance of other suboptimal algorithms for wsr maximization in miso - ic and simo - ic .",
    "we consider the `` price - based '' suboptimal algorithm , e.g. , the adp algorithm , which was proposed in @xcite as an efficient distributed algorithm for wsr maximization in siso - ic . since to our best knowledge , extensions of adp to the multi - antenna gic",
    "are not yet available in the literature , we provide the details for such extensions for simo - ic and miso - ic in appendix [ adp ] .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] show the achievable sum - rates by the price - based algorithm versus algorithm [ table1 ] for @xmath274-user simo - ic and miso - ic , respectively , without the minimum rate constraints .",
    "each element in all channel vectors involved is randomly generated by the cscg distribution with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "we set the parameters to control the accuracy of algorithm [ table1 ] as @xmath277 and @xmath278 . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the price - based algorithm converges to the sum - rate of @xmath304 in simo - ic , while the maximum sum - rate achieved by algorithm [ table1 ] is @xmath305 . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the price - based algorithm converges to the sum - rate of @xmath306 ( although it has reached almost @xmath307 before convergence ) in miso - ic , while algorithm [ table1 ] achieves the maximum sum - rate of @xmath308 .",
    "based on these results as well as other numerical examples ( not shown in this paper due to the space limitation ) , we infer that in general the price - based algorithm for simo - ic performs better than miso - ic , as both compared with our proposed algorithm that achieves the global sum - rate maximum .",
    "moreover , the price - based algorithm for miso - ic does not converge under certain channel setups , while even when the algorithm converges , the resulted sum - rate can be far from the global maximum . in contrast , for simo - ic , the price - based algorithm usually achieves the sum - rate very close to the global maximum , and even converges to it under certain channel setups .",
    "in this paper , we propose a new framework to achieve the global optimality of wsr maximization problems in siso - ic , simo - ic , and miso - ic , with the interference treated as gaussian noise .",
    "although the studied problems are non - convex with respect to the power allocation and/or beamforming vectors , we show that they belong to the monotonic optimization over a normal set by reformulating them as maximizing the wsr in the achievable rate regions directly .",
    "therefore , the outer polyblock approximation algorithm can be applied to achieve the global wsr maximum . furthermore , by utilizing the approach of rate profile , at each iteration of the proposed algorithm , the updated intersection point on the pareto boundary of the achievable rate region is efficiently obtained via solving a sequence of sinr feasibility problems .",
    "it is worth noting that although the developed framework in this paper is aimed to solve the wsr maximization problem for the gic , it can be similarly applied to other multiuser communication systems with non - convex rate regions provided that the problem of characterizing the intersection pareto boundary point with an arbitrary rate - profile vector can be efficiently solved .",
    "it is worth pointing out that based on our numerical experiments , the proposed algorithm in this paper is found to converge very slowly when the number of users becomes large ( e.g. , @xmath309 ) , and thus may not be suitable for real - time implementation .",
    "nevertheless , the proposed algorithm can be applied to provide performance benchmarks for other real - time algorithms that usually guarantee only suboptimal solutions .",
    "it is our hope that this paper will motivate future work to improve the convergence speed of the proposed algorithm and thus make it more applicable in practical systems , even with large number of users .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the original point for the algorithm is shifted from the origin to a point in the negative plane , which is shown to speed up the convergence to some extent .",
    "after the submission of this manuscript , we become aware of one interesting related work @xcite that is worth mentioning . in @xcite , a similar framework",
    "is proposed to optimize the system performance for multi - cell downlink miso beamforming ( similar to miso - ic in nature ) , e.g. , sum - rate performance and proportional fairness , by making use of monotonic optimization and rate profile techniques .",
    "one difference between @xcite and our work is that for the monotonic optimization part , a so - called `` branch - reduce - and - bound '' algorithm is used in @xcite as compared to the outer polyblock approximation algorithm in our paper .",
    "note that under the sum power constraint , a similar result to this lemma has been shown in @xcite .",
    "however , the proof in @xcite is not directly applicable in our case since in ( [ equ : matrix form2 ] ) , there is an individual power constraint rather than the sum power constraint .",
    "thus , we need to provide a new proof for this lemma shown as follows .",
    "suppose that there are two solutions to ( [ equ : matrix form2 ] ) , denoted by @xmath205 and @xmath310 .",

    "next , we present the kkt optimality conditions of problem ( p1.2 ) with the objective function specified in ( [ eq : mmse sinr ] ) . for any locally optimal power solution @xmath240 , there exist unique lagrangian multipliers @xmath326 such that for any @xmath327,@xmath328    now , for the price - based algorithm , define the price charged by receiver @xmath32 to transmitter @xmath25 , which indicates the sensitivity of the achievable rate of receiver @xmath32 subject to the power change of transmitter @xmath25 , as @xmath329consequently , we see that the kkt conditions in ( [ equ : kkt1 ] ) , ( [ equ : kkt2 ] ) and ( [ equ : kkt3 ] ) are both necessary and sufficient for the optimal solution to the following problem for user @xmath25 , @xmath327 : @xmath330where @xmath331 and @xmath332 are fixed , @xmath333 .",
    "similar to the adp algorithm in @xcite , we propose the following algorithm to update the price and transmit power iteratively for all users in simo - ic .",
    "specifically , at each iteration the algorithm does the following :    * each user announces its price obtained using ( [ eq : price ] ) to all the other users ; * each user updates its transmit power by solving problem ( [ equ : simo price ] ) , i.e. , @xmath334_0^{p_k^{{\\rm max } } } , ~~ \\forall k , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      because problems ( p1.2 ) and ( [ equ : simo price ] ) possess the same kkt optimality conditions , when the above algorithm converges to a set of optimal solutions to problems in ( [ equ : simo price ] ) for all @xmath25 s , this set of solutions will be at least a locally optimal solution to problem ( p1.2 ) .",
    "next , we extend the adp algorithm to miso - ic . for",
    "any given transmit beamforming vectors @xmath336 , we first define the price for user @xmath25 as @xmath337where @xmath338 is the total interference power at the @xmath25th receiver .",
    "let @xmath339 , @xmath37 .",
    "given fixed interference prices and beamforming vectors of all other users , the following problem is to be solved by any user @xmath25 for its own transmit beamforming update:@xmath340where @xmath341 means that @xmath342 is a positive semi - definite matrix . similar to the previous case of simo - ic , we can show that the kkt conditions of problem ( [ equ : game theory ] ) with @xmath327 are also those of problem ( p1.3 ) by replacing @xmath343 with @xmath342 , @xmath37 .",
    "however , problem ( p1.3 ) requires that the optimal solution @xmath344 in problem ( [ equ : game theory ] ) to be rank - one , which is not guaranteed a priori .",
    "thus , problem ( [ equ : game theory ] ) is a relaxation of the original wsr maximization problem ( p1.3 ) without considering the rank - one constraint .",
    "interestingly , it was recently shown in @xcite that the optimal solution to problem ( [ equ : game theory ] ) is always of rank - one , i.e. , @xmath345 .",
    "hence , we propose a price - based algorithm for miso - ic in a similar way to that for simo - ic .",
    "when this algorithm converges to a set of optimal solutions to problems in ( [ equ : game theory ] ) with @xmath327 , this set of solutions are all rank - one and thus corresponds to at least a locally optimal solution to problem ( p1.3 ) .    for this price - based algorithm for miso - ic",
    ", the interference price can be iteratively updated according to ( [ equ : price ] ) .",
    "as for the update of beamforming vectors , we need to solve problem ( [ equ : game theory ] ) for each user @xmath25 .",
    "it can be verified that problem ( [ equ : game theory ] ) is convex with strictly feasible points , and thus it can be solved by the standard lagrangian duality method @xcite with a zero duality gap .",

    "<S> characterizing the global maximum of weighted sum - rate ( wsr ) for the @xmath0-user gaussian interference channel ( gic ) , with the interference treated as gaussian noise , is a key problem in wireless communication . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the users mutual interference , this problem is in general non - convex and thus can not be solved directly by conventional convex optimization techniques . in this paper , by jointly utilizing the monotonic optimization and rate profile techniques , we develop a new framework to obtain the globally optimal power control and/or beamforming solutions to the wsr maximization problems for the gics with single - antenna transmitters and single - antenna receivers ( siso ) , single - antenna transmitters and multi - antenna receivers ( simo ) , or multi - antenna transmitters and single - antenna receivers ( miso ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that the transmitted signals have circularly symmetric complex gaussian distributions and are independent over time . </S>",
    "<S> different from prior work , this paper proposes to maximize the wsr in the achievable rate region of the gic directly by exploiting the facts that the achievable rate region is a `` normal '' set and the users wsr is a `` strictly increasing '' function over the rate region . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the wsr maximization is shown to be in the form of monotonic optimization over a normal set and thus can be solved globally optimally by the existing outer polyblock approximation algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> however , an essential step in the algorithm hinges on how to efficiently characterize the intersection point on the pareto boundary of the achievable rate region with any prescribed `` rate profile '' vector . </S>",
    "<S> this paper shows that such a problem can be transformed into a sequence of signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) feasibility problems , which can be solved efficiently by existing techniques . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results validate that the proposed algorithms can achieve the global wsr maximum for the siso , simo or miso gic , which serves as a performance benchmark for existing heuristic algorithms .    </S>",
