    "quantum systems are often delineated by modeling their classical counterparts  in fact , it is a standard practice that we define a system in quantum mechanics through the procedure called quantization , which amounts to replacing functions of phase space in classical mechanics by appropriate operators based on commutation relations .",
    "however , this quantization procedure does not necessarily provide a unique quantum system to a given classical system , with the familiar example being the ordering ambiguity of operators .",
    "nontrivial topology of the classical configuration space furnishes an additional ambiguity in the quantum system , which is exemplified by a particle moving on a circle where a multiple of windings are allowed for transitions . in particle physics",
    ", the same topological effect is known to be responsible for the infinite vacua structure which causes the strong cp violation ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "another source of ambiguity , which is less recognized and yet physically more tangible than the aforementioned ones , lies in the choice of boundary conditions imposed on quantum states @xcite .",
    "a prime example of this may be found in a particle system with an impenetrable wall , where one has a variety of boundary conditions to choose , say , from dirichlet to neumann or anything in between .",
    "these boundary conditions represent different physical properties of the wall which are missing in the classical description , and can lead to novel effects in the quantum system @xcite .",
    "a further example is provided by a singular point on a line , which serves as a source for a number of interesting properties , including supersymmetry and berry phase @xcite .",
    "the importance of boundary conditions in quantum mechanics becomes evident if we recall the rudimentary fact that a different choice of boundary conditions yields a different spectrum .",
    "the fact that the physical properties of quantum dots depend heavily on the boundary conditions will also be worth mentioning .    in order to provide a simple setup where",
    "the boundary effects can be observed directly , in our previous work @xcite we presented a case study of the induced pressure , or statistical quantum force , which emerges on an impenetrable partition wall inserted at the centre of an infinite potential well , when the wall is assumed to realize a nontrivial set of boundary conditions : the dirichlet condition on one side and the neumann on the other .",
    "we will not delve into here how such a partition can actually be manufactured as a device , but only mention that walls admitting generic boundary conditions including dirichlet and neumann can be realized by a combination of square well potentials in the vanishing limit of their widths @xcite .",
    "when two such walls , one with dirichlet and the other with neumann , are glued together  within a narrow distance , then it will serve as our partition effectively under a scale significantly larger than the distance . in more formal terms ,",
    "our partition is a special example of the general ( @xmath3 family of ) point singularities allowed quantum mechanically on a line , whose realizations by scaled families of regular potentials has been studied extensively @xcite .    once the partition wall is realized and placed in the well separating the same number @xmath4 of particles on its two sides , under the finite temperature @xmath5 we expect that the wall is pushed from the two sides by the particles in motion .",
    "now , the point is that the different boundary conditions imposed at the partition cause different energy levels and , accordingly , different statistical distributions of particles in the levels between the two half wells , yielding a net force @xmath6 on the wall . in @xcite",
    "we investigated the behaviour of the force @xmath6 as a function of @xmath5 , and examined how it scales with particle number @xmath4 for the two kinds of particle statistics , the bose - einstein statistics and the fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "there we have found that the force @xmath6 has a finite limit at zero temperature @xmath0 which scales as @xmath4 for bosons and as @xmath7 for fermions , and that it has a minimum before it diverges as @xmath2 for the high temperature limit @xmath8 .",
    "this raised a natural question if these results are specific to the potential used in the analysis , and if so how . in the present paper , we attempt to answer this by considering the same partition wall placed in a different potential , namely , the harmonic oscillator potential ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "one of the reasons for the harmonic potential is that , unlike the infinite well potential , it stretches infinitely for higher energies and shares a feature with potentials which are often used to describe actual physical systems .",
    "another reason is that , on account of its technical simplicity which we also exploit here , the harmonic potential itself is widely used in various physical contexts including confinement of particles in a narrow region .",
    "again , as illustrated in figure  [ fig:2 ] , we consider both bosonic and fermionic cases for particle statistics , and the number @xmath4 of particles is regarded as large but not macroscopically large ( to ensure its possible relevance to nano devises ) .",
    "we derive analytic approximate formulae for the force in the low , medium and high - temperature regimes separately , which are found to be reasonably good to reproduce the numerical results obtained for @xmath9 .",
    "note that , in actual realizations , our one dimensional system can be regarded as a model of an axis in three dimensions perpendicular to the surface of the partition which attracts the particles by the harmonic potential .",
    "3.4ex    our analysis then shows that , in contrast to the infinite well case , the force @xmath6 on the wall decreases as @xmath1 as the temperature increases in the high temperature regime , and eventually vanishes in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "this is the case for both bosons and fermions , and the force is of the order of @xmath4 . for the low temperature regime ,",
    "the zero temperature limit of the force is of the order of @xmath4 for bosons as in the potential well case , but for fermions it is of the order of @xmath10 in contrast to @xmath7 obtained in the potential well .",
    "we also find that , unlike the infinite well case , no minimal point of the net force is found in the medium - temperature regime irrespective of the statistics of the particles .",
    "implications of these results , combined with the previous ones , will be discussed in the text .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s2 ]",
    "we define the model and provide our scheme of analytical approximation for the induced force at arbitrary finite temperatures . in section  [ s3 ] ,",
    "we present our analysis in detail for the high temperature regime as well as the numerical results obtained .",
    "section  [ s4 ] is devoted to the analysis of the low temperature regime , where we employ independent approaches for the fermionic and bosonic cases .",
    "section  [ s5 ] discusses the medium - temperature regime where we also seek to interpolate the other two temperature regimes .",
    "finally , we present our conclusion and discussions in section  [ s6 ] .    3.4ex .1",
    "in this section , we first define the system mentioned earlier and introduce some notations convenient for the description of the system . with these , we present our basis of evaluating the induced force on the wall , and provide our scheme of analytical approximation used later .      to begin with , we recall the basic result of a harmonic oscillator system . for a particle moving on a line under the harmonic potential @xmath11 , the normalized energy eigenfunctions @xmath12 and the corresponding energy eigenvalues @xmath13 obeying the equations , @xmath14 are given by @xmath15{\\pi } } \\f{1}{\\s{2^l l ! } }    \\ , \\qh_l \\ !",

    "\\label{eigenfunc}\\ ] ] here , @xmath16 are the hermite functions @xcite and we have introduced the length scale @xmath17 and the energy scale @xmath18 ( the unusual factor 2 is for our later convenience ) .",
    "the hermite functions are even functions for even @xmath19 and odd functions for odd @xmath20 , and fulfill @xmath21    now let us divide the line into two by inserting an infinitely thin wall at @xmath22 and consider its consequence in one of the half lines , say , the positive one . if the boundary condition on the wave functions at the wall is the dirichlet condition , then for the particle confined in the positive half line , we have only the odd eigenfunctions , that is , @xmath23 where the factor @xmath24 is required for the normalization in the half line . on the other hand , if it is the neumann boundary condition , then we have only the even eigenfunctions , @xmath25 one may wonder if there exist eigenfunctions other than these ( [ diref ] ) and ( [ newef ] ) in our system , since after all our partition wall breaks the parity symmetry under @xmath26 forcing us to work in two half lines separately , and there seems no reason to consider only the standard eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator defined on the whole line with definite parities",
    ". however , this can not be the case , because if @xmath27 is any eigenfunction defined on the positive half line obeying , say , the dirichlet condition at @xmath22 , then one can extend it to the whole line by setting @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "the resultant function @xmath32 is regular at @xmath22 and satisfies the equation ( [ eigeneq ] ) on the whole line and hence provides an eigenfunction with odd parity of the harmonic oscillator , implying that it should be one of the standard ones @xmath33 .",
    "the case of the solutions with the neumann condition can be argued similarly .    to proceed , consider a statistical system consisting of @xmath4 mutually noninteracting identical particles in the harmonic potential in the half line under finite temperature @xmath5 .",
    "for convenience , we introduce the dimensionless quantities , @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the boltzmann constant , and write the energy eigenvalues as @xmath36 where the constant @xmath37 is given , for the dirichlet case and the neumann case , by @xmath38 respectively .",
    "the statistical distributions of the particles then read @xmath39    at a given temperature , the chemical constant @xmath40 is determined uniquely from the constraint @xmath41 .",
    "this implies that the combination @xmath42 is uniquely determined by the total number constraint , from which we learn that the distributions are actually the same for both of the dirichlet and the neumann boundary conditions , that is , @xmath43 for all @xmath44 .",
    "this allows us to introduce @xmath45 to obtain the simpler expression , @xmath46 commonly used for the two boundary conditions .",
    "we also find from @xmath47 and @xmath48 that @xmath49 , or @xmath50 .",
    "note that for bosons @xmath51 , the positivity of distributions @xmath52 for all @xmath44 implies @xmath53 at any temperature ( where the case @xmath54 gives the strongest condition ) . for fermions",
    "@xmath55 , no such restriction emerges and @xmath56 can take any value in @xmath57 .    at this point , we mention that the sum over the levels @xmath44 admits an exact resummation valid for @xmath53 , @xmath58 where we have used @xmath59",
    ". this resummation formula will be useful later .",
    "let us now suppose that the wall inserted at @xmath22 in the harmonic potential imposes the dirichlet boundary condition on the left ( negative ) side and the neumann boundary condition on the right ( positive ) side .",
    "due to the difference in the energy levels developed in the two sides of the wall , one expects that a net force , or statistical pressure , will emerge on the wall as a purely quantum effect deriving from the boundary conditions ( see figure  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "our aim is to evaluate this induced net force as a function of ( rescaled ) temperature @xmath60 .",
    "before we proceed , we recall the fact that for the case of the infinite potential well @xcite , the force acting on the wall from each side of the half lines proves to be essentially the same as the one giving the average energy , @xmath61 . from this , the net force is obtained by the difference @xmath62 . for the harmonic oscillator",
    ", the difference in the average energy reads @xmath63 which is temperature - independent .    however , for the harmonic oscillator the average energy is no longer the same as the force . to see this ,",
    "let us consider the contribution @xmath64 for the total force coming from one single level @xmath65 . under a shift @xmath66 of the wall from the origin ,",
    "the energy level will also change by @xmath67 , and from this the force is found by @xmath68 the total net force can then be obtained by gathering the force difference @xmath69 for all @xmath44 , which is the difference of the forces between the two sides of the wall arising from the two corresponding energy levels specified by the same integer @xmath44 . unfortunately , unlike the infinite well case , we do not have analytical solutions for the harmonic oscillator when the partition is displaced from the centre , and we are compelled to resort to some approximation scheme to evaluate the force ( [ forcedef ] ) .    at this point we recall that , mathematically speaking , the hamiltonian operator @xmath70 of our system has the infinity @xmath71 as a limit - point singularity whereas the position of the wall is a regular endpoint , meaning that for any real eigenvalue @xmath65 , there exists only one normalizable eigenfunction up to a phase factor . in more concrete terms , given an arbitrary @xmath65 we have two independent solutions for the differential equation ( [ eigeneq ] ) but requirement of normalizability determines a particular linear combination of the two as a possible candidate for an eigenfunction .",
    "it qualifies as a true eigenfunction when the boundary condition at the partition is further met , which is attained by tuning @xmath65 to be one of the particular set of real numbers which form the energy spectrum of the system .",
    "this heuristic picture of approaching eigenfunctions and eigenvalues suggests that , if the shift @xmath66 of the wall is sufficiently small , for a fixed ( dirichlet or neumann ) boundary condition the difference in the eigenfunctions should be small in the @xmath72 sense that their scalar product tends to 1 as @xmath73 , with the perturbed eigenvalue @xmath74 also being close to the unperturbed one @xmath65 .",
    "similarly , we expect that for a small variation @xmath66 the difference in the boundary values of the two wave functions or their derivatives ",
    "the former is nonvanishing for the neumann case while the latter is nonvanishing for the dirichlet case  remains small and in the same order @xmath75 at most .",
    "now , we consider the identity valid for any two real and normalized eigenfunctions , @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the scalar product on the positive half line , and the prime indicates the derivative with respect to @xmath78 , _ e.g. _ , @xmath79 .",
    "specifically , for the dirichlet case , we choose in ( [ ibp ] ) an unperturbed dirichlet eigenvalue @xmath80 and its eigenfunction @xmath81 for @xmath65 and @xmath82 , and the perturbed eigenvalue and eigenfunctions caused by the shift in the wall for @xmath65 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "based on our observations on the perturbed quantities , we find that the formula ( [ ibp ] ) in the leading order of @xmath66 or of @xmath83 yields @xmath84 or @xmath85 in parallel , our assumption ensures that @xmath86 and that the dirichlet condition is satisfied at the shifted wall @xmath87 , @xmath88 from which we have @xmath89    analogously , for the neumann case , we have @xmath90 or @xmath91 since @xmath82 is an eigenfunction , we find @xmath92 the neumann condition is satisfied at @xmath87 if @xmath93 from which we obtain @xmath94    combining ( [ denergy ] ) and ( [ nenergy ] ) together with ( [ eigenfunc ] ) and ( [ hzero ] ) , one can evaluate the contribution for the force difference coming from the @xmath44-th level as @xmath95 ^ 2 } { [ k ! ]",

    "one can also obtain an improved inequality utilizing the closer details @xmath114 and @xmath115 for @xmath116 , that is , @xmath117    we have furnished analytical approximations for the net force which form our basis for studying the temperature dependence of the force on the partition wall .",
    "we stress that , unlike the case of the potential well , we further need to improve the approximations to obtain results comparable to numerical computations .",
    "this is required by the nontrivial level dependence ( [ haf ] ) of the force in the harmonic case , and below we shall establish independent approaches to deal with infinite sums which are appropriate for three different temperature ( high , low and medium ) regimes .",
    "we now analyze the behavior of the net force when the temperature is sufficiently high @xmath118 or @xmath119 ( recall that @xmath120 is the rescaled dimensionless temperature in ( [ resctemp ] ) ) , where we are allowed to take @xmath53 .",
    "one can then approximate the formula ( [ hah ] ) as @xmath121 this approximation is certainly good for the terms @xmath122 , but if we assume the condition @xmath123 ( which is stronger than @xmath53 ) for which higher-@xmath124 terms in the sum ( [ hai ] ) are suppressed , then we can rewrite ( [ hai ] ) and perform the summation in closed form as @xmath125 which implies @xmath126 we can see from this outcome that for sufficiently high temperatures @xmath127 our approximation is indeed consistent with @xmath123 , suggesting that a valid approximation for @xmath128 can be obtained at least for @xmath60 with @xmath127 . based on this observation , we shall define the high - temperature regime of the system by the condition @xmath127 .",

    "there we find that , for both of the fermionic and the bosonic cases , the net force is a monotonically decreasing function in the high - temperature regime and vanishes in the limit @xmath134 .",
    "in fact , the expression ( [ hat ] ) shows that it decreases according to @xmath135 asymptotically as @xmath134 with the common order @xmath4 .",
    "this outcome is in sharp contrast to the infinite well case @xcite where the force @xmath136 diverges according to @xmath137 for both fermions and bosons ( see figure  [ addedfigure ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that this high - temperature expansion can be made applicable even for medium temperatures if we modify it slightly by adopting the pad approximant form @xcite to regularize its diverging behavior for @xmath138 .",
    "explicitly , we may take @xmath139 both of which admit the expansion ( [ hat ] ) but with slightly modified coefficients , @xmath140 we note that the regularized formula ( [ hax ] ) reproduces the analytical approximation ( [ hat ] ) quite well up to the third term ( the fourth also not being very different ) .",
    "however , for bosons the attempt to regularize at @xmath141 fails because ( [ hax ] ) diverges at a certain positive medium temperature value , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath142 , and this also ruins improvement in precision . for fermions , in contrast ,",
    "the approximation is indeed valid up to fairly low temperatures .",
    "it is also important to observe from the result ( [ hat ] ) that , similarly to @xmath56 , the net force @xmath143 also depends on @xmath60 and @xmath4 only through the combination @xmath129 in the high - temperature regime .",
    "4ex    in passing , we provide a technical remark that , if one wishes to improve the approximations ( [ hai ] ) and ( [ hao ] ) to curb the error caused by the replacement @xmath144 used above , one may instead use @xmath145 ( which is more precise by one order ) to obtain @xmath146 respectively .",

    "for a slightly higher temperature @xmath155 , we may assume that the distribution differs from ( [ hba ] ) only at @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",

    "consequently , in this low temperature regime , we have @xmath185 plugging ( [ hbj ] ) and ( [ hbk ] ) into ( [ haf ] ) and arranging terms according to the powers of @xmath186 , we find @xmath187 we can see that , in the bosonic case , the temperature dependence of @xmath188 begins at the order of @xmath189 with respect to the zero temperature value .",
    "we have so far gained reasonably good approximations of the net force for high and low - temperature regimes . in this section",

    ", we may find it convenient to introduce an interpolating function for the two curves connecting smoothly .",
    "this can be accomplished by using , for example , the scheme , @xmath224 where @xmath225 gives the interpolating function of the two curves described by @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "the interpolating point @xmath228 may be chosen as the value where @xmath229 holds , which ensures that at @xmath228 the weights @xmath230 and @xmath231 are equal irrespective of the value of @xmath232 .    in our case , we have @xmath233 and choose the function @xmath147 in ( [ hbx ] ) for @xmath234 and the function @xmath147 in ( [ hax ] ) for @xmath235 .",
    "then the numerically determined value of the interpolating point for @xmath236 is found to be @xmath237 . as for @xmath232",
    ", we know that ( [ hbx ] ) is precise up to the order of @xmath238 , and if we maintain this then we find that the smallest choice is @xmath239 .",
    "since this choice does not disturb the high - temperature expansion either , we may propose the resultant interpolating formula @xmath240 in ( [ hbz ] ) as the net force covering the whole temperature region .",
    "figure  [ hbq]b shows that this single formula reproduces the precise curve ( obtained numerically ) very well .",
    "note that this interpolating procedure is actually independent of @xmath4 , since , for all @xmath4s , it involves the same functions ( low and high temperature approximants of @xmath143 ) of the identical variable @xmath129 .",
    "this time we are again allowed to replace the sums by integrals with the approximation ( [ nbc ] ) . since for low temperatures @xmath207 is much larger than higher @xmath241 , we preserve its discrete value and introduce the continuous variable only above @xmath103 .",
    "this gives @xmath242 for the medium temperature regime , we find it reasonable to assume that it is characterized by @xmath243 and @xmath118 . under this",
    ", one may simplify the outcome by putting @xmath244 in all terms except the first in the expansion ( [ hcc ] ) ( the advantage of the specific value @xmath245 will turn out soon ) , since by far the first term @xmath246 is the most sensitive term for the change of @xmath56 on the scale of @xmath213 or below . in this approximation , ( [ hcc ] ) leads to @xmath247    the net force can also be evaluated by treating the sum analogously as @xmath248 where we have gone through steps similar to ( [ hbr ] ) and introduced an asymptotic expansion for the integrand to improve it in the dominant region .",
    "note that the choice @xmath244 has made this integral @xmath56-independent .    actually , the approximation of the integrand with the asymptotic expansion becomes better if we keep only the part of the integral where the approximated integrand is positive .",
    "because of this , we use @xmath249 and ( [ hce ] ) to evaluate ( [ hcf ] ) and find @xmath250 we may further consider some corrections for the expression to render it a little nicer without sacrificing its precision .",
    "this is done by omitting the last term @xmath24 which is negligible compared to the first term @xmath4 , which makes the @xmath172 limiting value the exact value @xmath251 .",
    "we also replace the coefficient of @xmath60 which is numerically @xmath252 by @xmath208 for simplicity .",
    "we then end up with @xmath253 as for lower temperatures the @xmath56-dependence of the terms @xmath254 is suppressed more , and since we could reach a formula that is precise even at @xmath141 , we may hope that , in spite of the assumption @xmath255 made above , this formula ( [ hci ] ) can be used even for the beginning part of the net force @xmath136 including @xmath141 .",
    "figure  [ hck ] shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "4ex    it is again possible to provide an interpolating formula between the low - temperature approximation and the high - temperature one based on the formula ( [ hbz ] ) by choosing the functions ( [ hci ] ) and ( [ hat ] ) for @xmath234 and @xmath235 , respectively .",
    "note , however , that this time the two curves do not cross each other , and the interpolating point @xmath256 may be chosen , _ e.g. _ , as the location where the two functions differ the least .",
    "for example , for @xmath236 , this yields @xmath257 .",
    "in addition , the value of @xmath232 can be chosen , for instance , by the requirement that the derivative of the interpolating function at @xmath258 be the same as that of the straight line that is the common tangent of the two curves to be connected . at @xmath9 , that common tangent straight line touches the low temperature curve at the point @xmath259 $ ] and the high temperature curve at @xmath260 $ ] in the coordinate plane of @xmath60 and @xmath147 .",
    "the slope of that straight line is @xmath261 , and this is to be put equal to the derivative of ( [ hbz ] ) at @xmath228 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath262 where we have used @xmath263 which comes from the definition of @xmath228 being the location where the difference is minimal . from this",
    "we find @xmath264 .",
    "one can invent some other criteria as well , but our aim here is only to present a formula in which the transition between the two curves appears as smoothly as possible , yet sharply enough to keep both curves practically intact on the regions where they are supposed to be reliable .    since the accuracy of the interpolation employed above is not very sensitive to the actual value of @xmath232 , we may round it off to the nearest integer @xmath265 , say , for brevity .",
    "figure  [ hck ] shows the resultant interpolating formula ( [ hbz ] ) with our choice of functions , which is almost indistinguishable from the numerical result .",
    "we should , however , keep in mind that for bosons the interpolation must be done @xmath4-dependently , because the scaling behaviour @xmath266 seen at the high - temperature regime does not arise at the low temperature regime .",
    "it also follows that a successful interpolation at some @xmath4 does not necessarily ensure a success for an analogously carried out interpolation at another @xmath4 .",
    "in this paper , we studied the system of @xmath4 particles confined in each of the two half lines separated by a partition wall at the centre of the harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "the partition is assumed to impose a set of distinct ",
    "the dirichlet and the neumann ",
    "boundary conditions on the left and on the right , respectively . due to the discordance in the energy levels in two sides of the partition , and also to the different distributions of particles on the energy levels at finite temperatures ,",
    "an induced force emerges on the partition , as we have seen earlier on the partition in the infinite potential well .",
    "we have evaluated the ( dimensionless ) net force @xmath136 that arises on the wall both analytically and numerically as a function of ( dimensionless ) temperature @xmath60 , and found that it exhibits a number of interesting behaviours characteristic to the harmonic potential .",
    "for instance , it has a non - vanishing limit @xmath164 at the zero temperature limit , which is just @xmath4 for bosons , while it is of the order of @xmath10 for fermions .",
    "note that in the case of the infinite potential well @xcite , the value @xmath164 for fermions is proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand , in the high - temperature regime , the force @xmath136 scales linearly in @xmath4 for both fermions and bosons .",
    "as temperature grows , it decreases according to @xmath135 and eventually vanishes in the limit @xmath134 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the infinite potential well case where the force @xmath136 diverges according to @xmath137 .",
    "the medium - temperature regime is somewhat difficult to deal with , but we have succeeded to obtain , after a rather technical argument , an analytic approximation that accounts for the numerical results reasonably well for both fermions and bosons .",
    "interpolation to the low and high - temperature regimes can also be possible , and we presented a possible formula of the force covering the entire regime of temperature . unlike the potential well case , the net force admits no minimum in the medium - temperature regime .",
    "the characteristic scaling behaviours in the zero temperature limit @xmath138 can be understood heuristically .",
    "namely , in the bosonic case , the force @xmath164 comes entirely from the contribution of the ground level where all particles reside , and hence it is given by @xmath267 multiplied by the number @xmath4 of the particles . in the fermionic case , on the other hand , the force @xmath164 consists of the contributions of @xmath268 up to the fermi level , yielding @xmath269 .",
    "this is to be compared to the infinite potential well case where we have @xmath270 and hence @xmath271 .    in the high - temperature regime",
    ", it can also be argued that the steady decrease in the present harmonic potential case , rather than the increase to infinity observed in the potential well case , derives basically from the spectral structure of the harmonic system .",
    "that is , for higher @xmath182 the energy level difference between the two half harmonic systems remains constant and does not give larger contributions , in contrast to the potential well case where the energy level difference becomes larger and eventually diverges for @xmath272 . in this respect ,",
    "we recall the upper bound ( [ ham ] ) for the force @xmath136 whose decrease for higher @xmath60 is already expected there as well . in physical terms , this is also understood from the infinite stretch of the harmonic potential where the higher energy states can spread more in space . as a result , the energy of the system becomes less sensitive to a shift of the partition at the centre , resulting in the decrease in the force for high temperatures .",
    "what can we learn from the results obtained here for the harmonic system when combined with those obtained previously for the infinite potential well system ?",
    "suppose that a partition wall can actually be manufactured with the distinct set of boundary conditions assumed in this paper , and further that the induced force on the partition wall can be measured with sufficient accuracy .",
    "then , one can estimate the profile of the potential in the neighbourhood of the partition wall by looking at the low temperature behaviour of @xmath147 , since the net force is sensitive to the spectral structure up to the fermi level for fermions when the temperature is low . from the high temperature behaviour of @xmath147",
    ", one can also obtain a crude picture of how the potential stretches in space further away from the wall .",
    "in addition , the characteristic scaling in the number @xmath4 of particles in the zero temperature limit will reveal the statistics of the particles contained around the wall . in short",
    ", such a nontrivial partition wall may be quite useful in probing the profile of the potential as well as the statistics of the particles involved .",
    "the present probe is still primitive to use for generic potentials , but it can be improved if we learn further the behaviours of the net force for other types of potentials in the high and the low temperature regimes along with the scaling property in the particle number .",
    "00                        see , for instance , ` http://mathworld.wolfram.com/stirlingsapproximation.html ` .",
    "this also presents two strict inequalities , where the lower estimate and the higher one differ only in the sub - subleading order of @xmath273 , which may be useful for proving strict inequalities , both for controlling numerical errors and for analytical strict bounds .",
