    "to understand the state of the art of raman spectroscopy in graphene it is important to know the historical development of the main ideas , nomenclature and peaks assignment starting from graphite .",
    "we thus give a detailed overview in appendix s4 , where we also introduce some background concepts , such as kohn anomalies@xcite . here",
    "we summarize the nomenclature and current understanding of the main peaks .    throughout this paper",
    "we will use the following notation : @xmath1 for a peak height , @xmath2 for its area , pos for its position , fwhm for the full width at half maximum , disp for its dispersion ( i.e. shift in peak position with changing excitation energy ) .",
    "so , e.g. , @xmath3 is the g  peak height , @xmath4 its area , fwhm(g ) the full width , pos(g ) its position , disp(g ) its dispersion .",
    "the phonon dispersion of single - layer graphene ( slg ) comprises three acoustic ( a ) and three optical ( o ) branches .",
    "the modes with out - of - plane ( z ) motion are considerably softer than the in - plane longitudinal ( l ) and transverse ( t ) ones .",
    "fig.1a plots the electronic brillouin zone ( bz ) of graphene , the first phonon bz , and the schematic electronic dispersion ( dirac cones ) .",
    "graphene has 2 atoms per unit cell , thus six normal modes at the bz center @xmath5 ( refs . ) : @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "there is one degenerate in - plane optical mode , @xmath7 , and one out - of - plane optical mode @xmath8 ( ref . ) .",
    "the @xmath7 phonons are raman active , while @xmath8 is neither raman nor infra red ( ir ) active@xcite .",
    "graphite has 4 atoms per unit cell .",
    "only half the carbons have fourth neighbors that lie directly above or below in adjacent layers .",
    "therefore , the two atoms of the unit cell in each layer are now inequivalent .",
    "this doubles the number of optical modes , and is responsible for the ir activity of graphite@xcite .",
    "all the optical modes become davydov - doublets : the @xmath7 generates a ir active @xmath9 and a raman active @xmath7 , the @xmath8 goes into an ir - active @xmath10 , and an inactive @xmath8 .",
    "the antisymmetric combinations of the acoustic modes are the optically inactive @xmath8 and the raman active @xmath7 .",
    "the symmetric combinations of the acoustic modes remain @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "thus , for graphite@xcite @xmath11(fig.1b ) .",
    "there are now two raman active @xmath7 modes , each doubly degenerate .",
    "the raman spectrum of slg consists of distinct bands@xcite ( fig.1e ) .",
    "fig.1d plots the optical phonon dispersions of slg , relevant for the interpretation of the raman spectra@xcite .",
    "the g peak corresponds to the high frequency @xmath7 phonon at @xmath5 .",
    "the d peak is due to the breathing modes of six - atom rings ( fig.1c ) and requires a defect for its activation@xcite .",
    "it comes from to phonons around the bz edge * k * ( refs . ) , is active by double resonance@xcite , and is strongly dispersive with excitation energy@xcite ( fig.1 g ) , due to a kohn anomaly at * k * ( ref . ) .",
    "double resonance can also happen as intra - valley process , i.e. connecting two points belonging to the same cone around @xmath12 ( or @xmath13 ) .",
    "this gives the so - called d@xmath14 peak .",
    "the 2d peak is the d peak overtone .",
    "the 2d@xmath14 peak is the d@xmath14 overtone . since 2d and 2d@xmath14 originate from a process where momentum conservation is satisfied by two phonons with opposite wavevectors , no defects are required for their activation , and are thus always present@xcite .    the band at @xmath15 in fig .",
    "1e was first reported in graphite by nemanich and solin@xcite .",
    "its interpretation was subject to debate , as discussed in appendix s4 .",
    "it is assigned to a combination of d  phonon and a phonon belonging to the la branch , seen at @xmath16 for visible excitation in defected samples , and called d@xmath17 peak@xcite .",
    "it is indicated as @xmath18 in fig .",
    "the raman spectrum of graphite and multi - layer graphene consists of two fundamentally different sets of peaks .",
    "those , such as d , g , 2d and so on , present also in slg , and due to in - plane vibrations@xcite , and others , such as the shear ( c ) modes@xcite and the layer breathing modes ( lbms)@xcite , due to relative motions of the planes themselves , either perpendicular or parallel to their normal .",
    "the low - frequency @xmath7 mode in graphite was first measured by nemanich _",
    "_ in 1975@xcite at @xmath19 .",
    "we called this mode c , since it is sensitive to the interlayer coupling@xcite ( fig .",
    ". the absence of the c peak would in principle be the most direct evidence of slg .",
    "however , it is not warranted to use the absence of a peak as a characterization tool , since one can never be sure why something is absent . on the other hand ,",
    "this mode scales with the number of layers ( @xmath20 ) , going to @xmath21 for bilayer graphene@xcite ( blg ) ( fig .",
    "the c peak frequency is below the notch and edge filter cut of many spectrometers , particularly those used for production - line monitoring .",
    "this problem was overcome recently by combining a braggrate filter with a single monochromator@xcite and , for the first time , pos(c ) was measured for an arbitrary @xmath20 ( ref .  ) .",
    "this method allows detection of similar modes in any other layered material@xcite . for bernal stacked samples , pos(c )",
    "varies with @xmath20 as@xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the interlayer coupling and @xmath24 is the graphene mass per unit area@xcite .",
    "lbms can also be observed in the raman spectra of flgs , via their resonant overtones in the range @xmath25 ( refs .  ) .",
    "note that , albeit being an in - plane mode , the 2d peak is sensitive to @xmath20 since the resonant raman mechanism that gives rise to it is closely linked to the details of the electronic band structure@xcite , the latter changing with @xmath20 , and the layers relative orientation@xcite . on the other hand , the c and lb modes are a direct probe of @xmath20 ( refs .  )",
    ", as the vibrations themselves are out of plane , thus directly sensitive to @xmath20 .",
    "because the fundamental lbm in bulk graphite is a silent @xmath26 mode at @xmath27 , the observation of the first - order lbm is a challenge .",
    "raman spectroscopy can also probe scattering of photons by electronic excitations .",
    "in pristine graphene , these have a continuous structureless spectrum@xcite , not leading to any sharp feature .",
    "however , it was realized that in a strong magnetic field , @xmath28 , when the electronic spectrum consists of discrete landau levels , the electronic inter - landau - level excitations give rise to sharp @xmath28-dependent peaks in the raman spectrum@xcite .",
    "the understanding of raman spectroscopy in graphite and related materials has challenged researchers for decades .",
    "the reason is the richness of phenomena combined with the wealth of experimental information that must be consistently arranged to solve the jigsaw .",
    "an introduction to raman scattering is presented in appendix s1 , whereas surface - enhanced and interference - enhanced raman spectroscopy in graphene are discussed in appendixes s2,s3 .        in graphene , graphite and nanotubes , raman processes involving up to six phonons can be easily measured@xcite . however , the vast majority of literature reports spectra up to @xmath29",
    "this restricts our attention to one - and two - phonon peaks .",
    "we can also distinguish between spectra measured on pristine samples ( i.e. , ideally defect - free , undoped , unstrained and so on ) and those measured on samples subject to external perturbations ( such as electric and magnetic fields , strains and so on ) or those with defects .",
    "we will cover external perturbations below , as well as in appendixes s6-s9 .",
    "defect - activated peaks will be discussed now together with those not requiring defects for their activation .    in general , raman scattering can be described by perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "an @xmath30-phonon process involves @xmath31 intermediate states , and is described by an @xmath32-order matrix element , as given by equation ( s3 ) in appendix .",
    "figure 2 plots the possible elementary steps of the raman processes contributing to each peak of graphene .",
    "according to the number of factors in the denominator of eq .",
    "( s3 ) that vanish , the processes can be classified as double resonant ( fig .",
    "2b - g , j , k ) or triple resonant ( fig .",
    "2h , i , l ) .",
    "higher orders are also possible in multiphonon processes .",
    "note that this classification is useful , but approximate ( valid when the electron - hole asymmetry and the difference in energies of the two phonons are neglected ) .",
    "the process in fig.2a is not resonant .",
    "one - phonon modes in defect - free samples can be raman active only if their symmetry is correct and their wavevector is zero ( i.e. , they obey the fundamental raman selection rule , see appendix s1 ) . in graphene ,",
    "only the c and g peaks satisfy these requirements .",
    "the energies of the intermediate states are given by the difference in energies of electrons in the empty @xmath33 and filled @xmath34 bands , @xmath35 ( with @xmath36 the electronic wave vector ) , with or without the phonon energy , @xmath37 at @xmath38 .",
    "the decay rate of the intermediate states is given by the sum of the scattering rates of the electron in the @xmath33  band , @xmath39 , and of the hole in the @xmath34  band , @xmath40 .",
    "the contribution from the phonon decay is typically smaller .",
    "counterintuitively , the electronic wave vectors @xmath36 mostly contributing to the matrix element for the g peak are not only those for which the excitation energies @xmath35 lie within an interval @xmath41 from @xmath42 or @xmath43 , where @xmath42 is the incident laser photon energy .",
    "instead , they are such that @xmath44 can be of the order of @xmath42 itself , and there are strong cancellations in the sum over  @xmath36 ( ref . ) .",
    "these correspond to destructive quantum interference .",
    "in fact , this interference can be controlled externally .",
    "indeed , occupations of electronic states can be changed by doping and , since transitions from an empty state or to a filled state are impossible due to pauli blocking , doping can effectively exclude some regions of  @xmath36 from contributing to the matrix element ( fig .",
    "due to suppression of destructive interference , this leads to an increase of the g peak intensity at high doping levels , as was predicted in ref .   and observed in refs .  .",
    "for two - phonon processes , the fundamental selection rule can be obeyed by any pair of phonons with opposite wave vectors , @xmath45 .",
    "the matrix element has four contributions corresponding to processes when ( i )  both phonons are emitted by the electron ( @xmath46 ) , ( ii )  both phonons are emitted by the hole ( @xmath47 ) , and ( iii )  one phonon is emitted by the electron , and the other by the hole ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) . in principle , one could expect the two - phonon raman spectrum to be a broad band , as determined by the sum of phonon frequencies @xmath50 from branches @xmath51 for all  @xmath52 , with possible features from van hove singularities in the joint phonon density of states .",
    "however , resonance conditions favor phonon states with @xmath52 coupling electronic states @xmath36 , @xmath53 , either in the same valley ( i.e. with @xmath52 near @xmath5 ) , or in different valleys ( @xmath52 near * k * ) .",
    "but , it turns out that even amongst these @xmath52 , very few are selected by subtle effects of resonance and quantum interference@xcite .",
    "these effects are , of course , captured by the direct integration over the electron momentum , where they appear as cancelations in the sum over  @xmath36 , but they are most easily understood by considering the raman process in real space .",
    "raman scattering in the real space was first considered in 1974@xcite , and the spatial separation between electron and hole in cascade multiphonon raman scattering was analyzed in 1983@xcite . however , in the context of graphene this approach was proposed only recently@xcite .",
    "the real - space picture is especially useful when translational invariance is lacking due to defects or edges .",
    "it arises because of separation of two energy scales : the electronic energy @xmath54 ( @xmath55 for visible raman ) , and the energy uncertainty @xmath56 . for the triple - resonant processes in fig .",
    "[ fig : res]h , i , l , @xmath57 is of the order of the broadening @xmath58 ( a few tens mev ; refs . ) . for the double - resonant processes in fig .",
    "[ fig : res]b  g , j , k , @xmath57 is of the order of the phonon energy @xmath59 , 0.17 or 0.20  ev for phonons near @xmath5 or @xmath60 ( ref .  ) . from the uncertainty principle",
    ", @xmath57 determines the typical lifetime of the intermediate state , @xmath61 , be it real or virtual .",
    "this gives the process duration , while @xmath62 its spatial extent ( @xmath63 is the fermi velocity ) .",
    "for triple - resonant processes , @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 ; for double - resonant processes , @xmath66 ( for @xmath67 ) .",
    "since @xmath68 is much bigger than the electron wavelength , @xmath69 for @xmath70 , the electron and hole motion can be viewed in quasi - classical manner , as shown in fig.[fig : traject ] for two - phonon processes .",
    "this is analogous to the geometrical optics approximation for electromagnetic waves , with electronic trajectories corresponding to light rays .",
    "the quasi - classical picture arises when calculating the raman matrix elements in the coordinate representation@xcite . it does not require real @xmath71 populations , as it is a property of wave functions .        from the real - space picture",
    "it is seen that two - phonon processes are mostly contributed by those @xmath52 which correspond to @xmath72 and @xmath73 scattered backwards , otherwise @xmath72 and @xmath73 will not meet in the same point .",
    "the backscattering condition , corresponding to reversal of the direction of the group velocity , agrees with the nesting condition of ref . , and has been mentioned as early as in 1974@xcite . in particular",
    ", this eliminates the contribution from two phonons with @xmath38 which would correspond , e.g. , to the g peak overtone , explaining why the 2 g peak is not seen in the raman spectrum ( unfortunately many works still mistakenly name the 2d@xmath14 peak as 2 g ) . also , the @xmath74 and @xmath47 processes , where one of the carriers has to travel longer than the other , are in conflict with the requirement that they travel for the same amount of time ( this would not be the case if @xmath72 and @xmath73 had strongly different velocities ) . strictly speaking , such processes , prohibited in the classical picture ( corresponding to @xmath75 ) ,",
    "are allowed in the full quantum picture , but they are weaker than the dominant contribution .",
    "note that the g peak is also classically forbidden ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 can not meet at the same point ) .",
    "thus , one may wonder why it produces a noticeable feature in the spectrum , while classically forbidden processes in two - phonon scattering are not seen .",
    "one reason is that two - phonon processes contain a higher power of the small electron - phonon coupling ( epc ) ; another is that the g peak is narrow ( a few @xmath76 ) , while the two - phonon bands spread over hundreds of @xmath76 .    in samples with defects",
    "the overall momentum conservation can be satisfied by adding an electron - defect scattering event to the process .",
    "we can thus have ( i )  one - phonon defect - assisted processes , producing the d , d@xmath14 , d@xmath17 and other smaller peaks , ( ii )  two - phonon defect - assisted processes , such as those leading to the @xmath77 peak .",
    "for one - phonon defect - assisted processes the matrix element has the same form as two - phonon defect - free processes , it is sufficient to replace the electron - phonon hamiltonian by the electron - defect hamiltonian , and set the frequency of the second phonon to zero .",
    "for the two - phonon defect - assisted processes the situation is quite different .",
    "the explicit formula for the matrix element contains 48 terms , each having five matrix elements in the numerator and a product of four factors in the denominator .",
    "fig.[fig : traject]a@xmath78 shows that for the @xmath77 peak there is no backscattering restriction , so the phonon momenta ( counted from * k * and @xmath5 ) can be between 0 and @xmath79 .",
    "thus the @xmath77 peak is much broader than 2d or 2d@xmath14 , since in the latter the magnitude of the phonon momentum is fixed by the backscattering condition , and @xmath80 .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath77 peak is often labeled as d+g in literature , due to lack of understanding of this activation mechanism .",
    "these simple considerations can explain the peaks dispersions .",
    "e.g. , in the 2d process ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res]i ) , the photon creates @xmath72 and @xmath73 with momenta @xmath81 and @xmath82 , counted from the dirac points .",
    "these then emit phonons with momenta @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( counted from the @xmath85 point ) . in the dirac approximation for the electronic dispersion , @xmath86 , and assuming isotropic phonon dispersions around @xmath85 , the magnitudes of @xmath81 and @xmath87 before and after phonon emission are fixed by the resonance condition : @xmath88 , @xmath89 . the backscattering condition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : traject]a ) fixes the relative orientation of @xmath81,@xmath87 ( i.e. , opposite directions ) , thus the magnitude of @xmath52 is : @xmath90 neglecting @xmath91 , we estimate disp(2d ) as : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the to phonon group velocity . since @xmath94 ( ref . )",
    ", we obtain @xmath95 .",
    "a similar argument holds for the @xmath96 peak , whose experimentally observed dispersion@xmath97 is determined as @xmath98 ( the la phonon has a negative slope as the wave vector moves away from the * k * point)@xcite .",
    "an understanding of the main contributions to the widths of the raman peaks in graphene has been recently achieved . besides the anharmonic and epc terms , which dominate the width of the g peak@xcite",
    ", other factors can contribute to the widths of higher - order peaks .",
    "one is the @xmath72 , @xmath73 dispersion anisotropy , since phonons emitted by @xmath72 with different @xmath81 directions have different frequencies@xcite .",
    "another is the uncertainty in momentum due to the electronic scattering rate@xcite .",
    "when all these mechanisms are taken into account ( note that they are not simply additive ) , the experimental width of the peaks , such as d and 2d , is reproduced@xcite .",
    "the intensities of the two - phonon peaks are suppressed by electronic scattering@xcite .",
    "anisotropy of the latter@xcite , together with the epc anisotropy@xcite , makes the electronic states close to the @xmath99 line ( the so - called inner resonance ) dominate the two - phonon raman process for visible excitation , which explains recent experimental observations@xcite .",
    "different contributions come to play when moving towards uv excitation .    for the d and d@xmath14 peaks ,",
    "the electron and hole momenta can have different magnitudes , depending on which of the intermediate states is virtual@xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : res]d , e . arguments analogous to those presented above give two possibilities for the emitted phonon momentum : @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "this means that d could in principle have two components@xcite separated by @xmath102 ( this should not be confused with the two d peak components seen in graphite@xcite , which reflect the three - dimensional electron dispersion , as discussed in section  [ sec : layers]@xcite , nor with the broadening and splitting expected for uv excitation ) .",
    "such splitting , if present , should be seen in the raman spectrum .",
    "however even in slg with very few defects , @xmath103 , thus larger than this splitting .",
    "this also means that @xmath104 can be slightly higher than @xmath105 , as the latter is uniquely determined by @xmath106 . for d@xmath14 , @xmath107 ,",
    "thus the difference between @xmath108 and @xmath109 is barely detectable .",
    "the intensities of different peaks were reported to depend differently on the excitation frequency @xmath110 ( ref .  ):",
    "while @xmath111 show no @xmath110-dependence , @xmath4 was found to be @xmath112 .",
    "the independence of @xmath113 on @xmath110 agrees with the theoretical prediction@xcite if one assumes that the electronic scattering rate is proportional to the energy . for the g peak , ref",
    ".   predicted @xmath114 at low  @xmath110 , and strong enhancement of @xmath115 as @xmath110 approaches the van hove singularity corresponding to the electronic excitation at the * m * point , reported to be as low as 4.6  ev ( refs .  ) .",
    "it can not be excluded that the @xmath116-dependence , established empirically from measurements in the range @xmath117 , corresponds to the crossover between @xmath118 and the enhancement at the van hove singularity . for the d peak ,",
    ".   gave @xmath119 .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy with experiments remains unclear .",
    "note , however , that a fully quantitative theory for @xmath120 and its excitation energy dependence is not trivial since , in general , @xmath120 depends not only on the concentration of defects , but on their type as well ( e.g. , only defects able to scatter electrons between the two valleys can contribute ) .",
    "different defects can also produce different frequency and polarization dependence of @xmath120 .",
    "thus a wealth of information still remains to be uncovered from the d peak .",
    "so far , we only considered stokes processes . for anti - stokes ,",
    "the resonance conditions are modified . for the 2d peak ,",
    "the momentum of the absorbed phonons is determined by an equation similar to eq .",
    "( [ q2d= ] ) , but with a `` + '' sign in front of @xmath121 .",
    "thus , the phonon momenta in the anti - stokes process are greater than those in the stokes process by @xmath122 .",
    "this explains the stokes / anti - stokes process difference@xcite :",
    "@xmath123 as discussed above , the d , d@xmath14 peaks could , in principle , have two components . in this case ,",
    "one of them has the same frequency in the stokes and anti - stokes scattering , while the other corresponds to a lower frequency in stokes , and an higher one in anti - stokes ( ref .  ) .",
    "it is important to consider the stokes / anti - stokes difference when determining the temperature @xmath124 from the stokes / anti - stokes ratio , both in nanotubes and graphene , as the phonons involved in stokes and anti - stokes are not the same , unlike what generally happens in other materials , and contrary to what is required for determining @xmath124 from this ratio .",
    "accurate calibra tions are thus needed .",
    "it should come as no surprise if a mismatch between expected and measured @xmath124 arises .",
    "edges are preferred sites to attach functional groups@xcite , and their electronic and magnetic properties are different from the bulk@xcite . figs .",
    "3b@xmath125,b@xmath126 show zigzag and armchair edges schematically .",
    "there is evidence that such ideal edges can be produced by chemical@xcite or thermal treatments@xcite .",
    "however , most exfoliated samples , even if with macroscopically smooth edges oriented at well - defined angles , are in fact not necessarily microscopically ordered , with disordered edges , often consisting of zigzag and armchair segments@xcite .",
    "edges can be viewed as extended defects , breaking the translational symmetry , even though a perfect zigzag or armchair edge still preserves the translation symmetry along the edge .",
    "an immediate consequence of symmetry breaking is the d , d@xmath14 peak activation .",
    "however , a closer look at the raman process shows that a perfect zigzag edge can not produce the d  peak@xcite .",
    "due to translational invariance along the edge , a perfect zigzag edge can not scatter electrons between the @xmath127 and @xmath128 valleys , fig.3b@xmath129 .",
    "this does not apply to d@xmath14 .",
    "this peak , not involving intervalley scattering , can be activated both by armchair and zigzag edges , since both @xmath130 , @xmath131 are compatible with the required intravalley scattering .",
    "this is not enough to determine whether one type of edge is more efficient than the other for d@xmath14-peak activation .    in the real space",
    ", a perfect armchair edge requires the electronic momentum to be perpendicular to it , in order to contribute to d , otherwise @xmath72 and @xmath73 can not meet and recombine radiatively ( fig .",
    "3b@xmath78 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath36 needs to be along the @xmath132 line , in order to contribute to d  peak .",
    "this , in combination with the @xmath133 $ ] dependence for the dipole transition matrix element ( @xmath134 being the polarization vector ) , discussed in appendix s5 , results in a strong polarization dependence : @xmath135 , if the excitation is performed with linearly polarized light , oriented at an angle  @xmath136 with respect to the edge , and all polarizations are detected for the scattered light , or @xmath137 if an analyzer , parallel to the polarizer , is used . for d",
    "the real - space picture is analogous to that for d. for regular edges this leads to the same @xmath138 or @xmath139 dependence , as observed in refs .  .",
    "for a disordered edge , @xmath140 and @xmath141 do not vanish even for @xmath142 ( polarization @xmath134 perpendicular to the edge ) .",
    "indeed , the polarization dependence for a disordered edge , is determined by contributions from armchair and zigzag segments with different orientations .",
    "the ratio @xmath143 can be used as a measure of edge imperfection@xcite .",
    "the g peak , even though present in the bulk , can be modified near an edge .",
    "the edge changes the electronic states , which affects ( i )  the epc correction to the phonon frequency , and ( ii ) electron - phonon and electron - photon matrix elements , responsible for the raman process itself@xcite .",
    "the correction to the phonon frequency vanishes for displacements perpendicular to the zigzag or armchair edge .",
    "the electron - phonon and electron - photon matrix elements vanish when displacements or light polarization are parallel ( perpendicular ) to the zigzag ( armchair ) edge .",
    "thus , one of the two modes ( depending on edge type ) does not show a kohn anomaly , and does not contribute to the raman spectrum .",
    "this gives ( i ) position - dependent @xmath144@xcite ; ( ii ) strong polarization dependence of i(g ) near the edge : @xmath145 for a perfect armchair and @xmath146 for a perfect zigzag edge , allowing the edge type to be probed@xcite and even controlled@xcite .",
    "there is a significant change in shape and intensity of the 2d peak when moving from slg to graphite@xcite ( fig .",

    "resonant raman scattering has been intensely studied since the 1960 - 1970s for semiconductors ( see ref . for a review ) .",

    "thus , the frequency - integrated intensity is preserved as long as @xmath270 is not changed significantly by the perturbation .",
    "the latter holds when the perturbation is smaller than the energy scale determining  @xmath270 .",
    "this is usually dominated by electronic broadening , and often larger . converting energy into time by the uncertainty principle , if the process is faster than phonon decay , the total number of photons emitted within the given peak ( i.  e. , integrated over frequency across the peak ) , is not affected by phonon decay , although their spectral distribution can be .",
    "raman spectroscopy can also probe scattering of photons by electronic excitations .",
    "in pristine graphene electronic excitations have a continuous structureless spectrum@xcite , which does not lead to any sharp features .",
    "however , in a strong magnetic field , @xmath28 , when the electronic spectrum consists of discrete landau levels , the electronic inter - landau - level excitations give rise to sharp @xmath28-dependent peaks in the raman spectrum@xcite .",
    "in general the raman intensity depends on the square of the incident field amplitude@xcite .",
    "thus it can also be enhanced by a proper choice of substrate and spacer , resulting in the so called interference enhanced raman scattering ( iers ) .",
    "this is a common occurrence in graphene@xcite , and the reasons are analogous to those enabling its visibility on a substrate@xcite . due to interference , the enhancement varies as a function of both excitation and emission wavelengths , being in principle different for different raman peaks .",
    "the transfer matrix method can be used to evaluate the effect of substrate interference and sample absorption@xcite .",
    "first , the incident amplitude @xmath279 in the sample is evaluated , as a function of sample thickness @xmath280 .",
    "the raman absorption at depth @xmath280 is proportional to @xmath281 .",
    "next the emissivity @xmath282 from depth @xmath280 at the corresponding stokes - shifted frequency is calculated@xcite .",
    "the raman intensity is then proportional to @xmath283 .",
    "this shows that changes with respect to an `` intrinsic '' @xmath284 are small for a slg on 300  nm sio@xmath126 measured at 514  nm .",
    "thus it is safe to compare this ratio amongst different samples and assign its variation to doping or other external perturbations .",
    "however , different substrates or wavelengths , may result in iers changes of @xmath284 even for the same sample . on the other hand ,",
    "an optimal interference - enhancing substrate could be designed , with uniform enhancement across different raman bands ( so that their ratios do not change ) , at the same time ensuring high optical visibility .",
    "surface enhanced raman scattering ( sers ) exploits surface plasmons induced by the incident field in metallic nanostructures , to increase the intensity @xcite . in principle , even a single metallic nanostructure , e.g. , a nanotip , can induce sers , giving rise to the so - called tip - enhanced raman scattering ( ters)@xcite . the key feature of ters is its capability of optical sensing with high spatial resolution beyond the light diffraction limits@xcite .",
    "graphene offers an ideal model system to study sers .",
    "ref .   did sers by depositing patterned particles of different sizes and spacing on slg .",
    "taking into account the surface plasmon resonance near - fields , the raman enhancement scales with particle cross section , fourth power of mie enhancement , and inversely with the tenth power of the separation between particle centre and graphene@xcite , pointing to thin nanodisks to achieve the highest sers for 2d systems like graphene@xcite .",
    "fig.1e in the main text shows the raman spectrum of pristine and defected graphene , while fig.4f of the main text compares the raman spectra of graphite , nanotubes and amorphous carbons .",
    "it is very instructive to summarize the main steps in the historical development of the understanding of the graphite raman spectrum .",
    "this was first reported in 1970 in the seminal work of tuinstra and koenig ( tk)@xcite .",
    "they assigned the mode at @xmath285  @xmath76 to the high frequency @xmath7 raman allowed optical phonon .",
    "they also measured in defected and nanocrystalline graphite a second peak at @xmath1681350  @xmath76 .",
    "they assigned it to an @xmath222 breathing mode at * k * , activated by the relaxation of the raman fundamental selection rule@xcite .",
    "this was done following both the `` molecular '' and `` solid state '' routes .",
    "the assignment is straightforward considering carbons as big molecules@xcite .",
    "similar bands are detected in all poly - aromatic hydrocarbons@xcite .",
    "the higher frequency band is due to bond stretching of @xmath0 pairs in both rings and chains , while the lower frequency one is due breathing modes of @xmath0 atoms in rings@xcite ( fig.1c of the main text ) .",
    "thus , in absence of rings , the latter would be absent , while the former is present in any carbon materials , ranging from carbon chains , to hard amorphous carbons@xcite ( fig.4f of the main text ) . except for uv excitation ,",
    "the raman spectra of carbons are dominated by the @xmath0 sites , because visible light resonates with the @xmath34 states , the cross section for graphite and graphene at 514  nm being@xmath16855 times higher than diamond@xcite . only for diamond , or samples with a significant fraction of diamond phase , the diamond @xmath174 peak at 1332",
    "@xmath76 is seen@xcite . in amorphous carbons ,",
    "the c@xmath244c @xmath174 vibrations can be seen for uv excitation at @xmath1681060@xmath76 ( t peak , from tetrahedral)@xcite .",
    "the `` solid - state '' interpretation has been debated for the past 40 years .",
    "tuinstra and koenig tried to combine the `` molecular '' and `` solid - state '' approaches as follows .",
    "first they considered graphite nanocrystals as big aromtic molecules , and noted that the only new raman active modes would have @xmath222 symmetry ( fig.1b of the main text ) .",
    "then they looked at the graphene lattice and noted that the only bz points with high enough symmetry to give an @xmath222 mode were @xmath85 and @xmath286 .",
    "they were left with a problem : the fundamental raman selection rule forbids @xmath287 phonons .",
    "since they observed the @xmath1681350@xmath76 band to increase with decreasing crystal size , they assumed that phonon confinement in ever smaller nanocrystals would progressively lift the selection rule . from the uncertainty principle @xmath288 , thus @xmath181 , and the smaller the crystal size @xmath289 , the larger @xmath290 .",
    "however , this picture had a flaw .",
    "to activate bz boundary @xmath222 phonons requires @xmath291 lattice spacing , in disagreement with the observation of the @xmath1681350  @xmath76 band in crystals as large as @xmath168100  nm@xcite .",
    "also , confinement could not explain why the @xmath222 mode is more intense than others closer to @xmath5 ( all these modes could in principle be activated , as happens in other nanomaterials@xcite ) .",
    "tuinstra and koenig did not give any names to these raman peaks .",
    "the first nomenclature was proposed by vidano and fishbach in 1977@xcite . since they observed strong lines at @xmath1681580 and @xmath1682700  @xmath76 in pristine graphite , while other bands at @xmath168  1350 and @xmath1681620  @xmath76 only appeared in defected graphite , they called the former g , g@xmath14 ( from graphite ) and the latter d , d@xmath14 ( from disorder ) .",
    "nemanich and solin detected a sharp band at @xmath1683250  @xmath76 in pristine graphite@xcite , as well as a weaker one at @xmath1682450  @xmath76@xcite .",
    "they also noted a further peak at@xmath1682950  @xmath76 in defected samples@xcite , later named d@xmath17 by vidano et al.@xcite . in 1979",
    "nemanich and solin , by polarization dependent measurements , determined that all peaks between 2300 and 3250  @xmath76 in pristine graphite are overtones .",
    "in particular , they indicated that the @xmath1682450  @xmath76 peak was also an overtone .",
    "they also noted that , with defects , combinations of phonons with different wavevectors become allowed , since the requirement to have opposite wavevector is progressively lifted .",
    "they thus assigned the@xmath1682950  @xmath76 band as @xmath77 , rather than @xmath292 , due to the phonon density of states ( pdos ) maximum at@xmath1681620  @xmath76 for the lo branch ( fig .",
    "1d of the main text ) .",
    "in 1981 vidano _",
    "_ studied the excitation energy dependence , and confirmed g@xmath14 to be the d overtone , and the @xmath1683250  @xmath76 peak the d@xmath14 overtone , since these shifted at twice the rate of their fundamentals@xcite .",
    "they stressed those bands behaved differently from g , that did not move with excitation energy .",
    "they also noted the energy dependence of the @xmath1682950  @xmath76 peak was consistent with @xmath77 , or @xmath292 .",
    "thus , by 1981 it was clear that , while the raman - allowed first - order g peak did not shift with excitation energy , the `` defect - related '' bands d , d@xmath14 , their overtones and combinations did .",
    "this ruled out their assignment to pdos maxima , activated by confinement , since a pdos maximum can not change as a function of excitation energy , being an intrinsic material property .",
    "the symmetry and phonon branches that originated d and d@xmath14 were also known .",
    "the next step would have been to figure out the reason for this shift .",
    "however , subsequent works claimed d derived from a pdos maximum around * m * or * * k**@xcite , even though phonons at * m * do not have the required symmetry , pdos maxima are inconsistent with the d and g@xmath14 dispersion , and the dimension of the crystals in ref .",
    "was too big to activate zone boundary phonons by confinement only .",
    "these issues and discrepancies remained unresolved , and even ignored , for the following 16 years .",
    "a similar fate happened for other main peaks .",
    "e.g. , although it was clear the@xmath1683250",
    "@xmath76 band is not the g second order , a large number of papers ( to date ) still call it 2 g .    in 1998",
    "pocsik et al.@xcite repeated the experiments of vidano _ _ et al.__@xcite over a much larger excitation energy range , as shown in fig .",
    "1 g of the main text , and , not surprisingly , found the same results . to try and explain the excitation energy dependence they proposed a `` new '' resonant process , whereby a strong enhancement of the raman cross - section would happen for a phonon of wavevector @xmath52 , when this equals the wavevector @xmath36 of the electronic transition excited by the incident photon ( the so - called @xmath36=@xmath52 `` quasi - selection rule''@xcite ) .",
    "however , the physical reason for this `` quasi - selection rule '' was unclear ( it does not exist in raman scattering ) and did not yet explain why , amongst all phonons satisfying it , only those on one particular branch would be seen . given the experimental @xmath293  @xmath76/ev,@xcite only a phonon branch upshifting from * k * would satisfy the `` quasi - selection '' rule , since the linear electron dispersions select larger  @xmath263 with increasing excitation energy , thus larger  @xmath294 . however , the to branch , corresponding to the @xmath222 phonon at * k * , had the opposite behavior in the most popular calculations at the time@xcite .",
    "pocsik et al .",
    "thus identified the lo branch , with e symmetry at * k * , as responsible for the d peak , in contrast with tk . in 1999 ref .   repeated the experiments of ref .  , and reached the same conclusions@xcite .",
    "thus , 30 years after ref .  , we were back to square one .",
    "a selection rule had to be `` invented '' to explain the d peak , and it was assigned to a different branch and symmetry , in contrast with the `` molecular '' view@xcite .",
    "there was also no convincing explanation why a zone boundary phonon would be active .    in 2000 , thomsen and reich suggested double resonance as the activation mechanism@xcite : i ) the laser excites an _ e - h _ pair with wavevector * k * defined by resonance with the @xmath295 bands ; ii ) this is followed by electron - phonon scattering with exchanged momentum * q * near * k * ; iii ) defect back - scattering of the electron to the initial * k * ; iv ) _ e - h _ recombination .",
    "this process allows for an exchange of a large phonon momentum , while satisfying energy conservation at any step , thus the fundamental raman selection rule .",
    "a defect is also needed , consistent with the observations of tk .",

    "our nomenclature allows to simply assign all these bands : 4d , 6d , 4d@xmath14 , etc . with the old names , the overtones and combinations",

    "<S> we describe essential physical processes whose importance has only recently been recognized , such as the various types of resonance at play , and the role of quantum interference . </S>",
    "<S> we update all basic concepts and notations , and propose a terminology that is able to describe any result in literature . </S>",
    "<S> we finally highlight the potential of raman spectroscopy for layered materials other than graphene .    </S>",
    "<S> graphene is the two - dimensional ( 2d ) building block for @xmath0 carbon allotropes of every other dimensionality . </S>",
    "<S> it can be stacked into 3d graphite , rolled into 1d nanotubes , or wrapped into 0d fullerenes . </S>",
    "<S> it is at the centre of an ever expanding research area@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> near - ballistic transport and high mobility make it an ideal material for nanoelectronics , especially for high frequency applications@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , its optical and mechanical properties are ideal for micro and nanomechanical systems , thin - film transistors , transparent and conductive composites and electrodes , flexible and printable ( opto)electronics , and photonics@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an ideal characterization tool would be fast and non - destructive , offer high resolution , give structural and electronic information , and be applicable to both laboratory and mass - production scales . </S>",
    "<S> raman spectroscopy@xcite fulfills all these requirements . </S>",
    "<S> the raman spectrum of graphite was first recorded more than 40 years ago@xcite and , by the time the raman spectrum of graphene was measured for the first time in 2006@xcite , raman spectroscopy had become one of the most popular techniques for the characterization of disordered and amorphous carbons , fullerenes , nanotubes , diamonds , carbon chains , and poly - conjugated molecules@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> raman techniques are particularly useful for graphene@xcite since the absence of a band gap makes all incident wavelengths resonant , so that the raman spectrum contains information about both atomic structure and electronic properties . </S>",
    "<S> resonance can also be reached by uv excitation@xcite , either with the * m*-point van hove singularity , or in the case of band gap opening , such as in fluorinated - graphene .    </S>",
    "<S> the number of graphene layers in a sample can be determined by elastic light scattering / rayleigh spectroscopy@xcite , but this approach only works for exfoliated samples on optimized substrates and does not provide other structural or electronic information . </S>",
    "<S> raman spectroscopy , on the other hand , works for all graphene samples@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is able to identify unwanted by - products , structural damage , functional groups and chemical modifications introduced during the preparation , processing or placement of graphene@xcite . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> a raman spectrum is invaluable for quality control , and for comparing samples used by different research groups .    </S>",
    "<S> the toll for the simplicity of raman measurements is paid when it comes to spectral interpretation . </S>",

    "<S> the understanding of the basic raman processes has changed . </S>",
    "<S> raman scattering on phonons is to a large extent determined by electrons : how they move , interfere , and scatter . </S>",
    "<S> thus , any variation of electronic properties due to defects or edges , doping , magnetic fields , affects positions , widths , and intensities of the raman peaks , enabling one to probe electrons via phonons . </S>",
    "<S> quantum interference effects@xcite play a key role , and they can also be probed by this technique .    here </S>",
    "<S> we review these new developments , and incorporate them into a general framework for raman spectroscopy in graphene based on a unified and self - consistent terminology . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the basic physics of raman scattering in graphene , and discuss the effects of edges , number of layers , defects and disorder , and perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we outline the history of the field , interference@xcite and surface - enhanced@xcite raman scattering in the appendix ( s4 , s2 and s3 , respectively ) , along with the effects of polarization ( s5 ) , electric fields and doping ( s6 ) , magnetic field ( s7 ) , uniaxial and biaxial strain ( s8 ) , temperature ( s9 ) , isotopes ( s10 ) and other examples ( s11 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the key difference between our framework and those published previously @xcite is that we start from the general picture of the raman process , and show how the numerous observed effects naturally arise from it . </S>",
    "<S> this approach creates a unified view of raman scattering , thereby enabling one to better understand the observed effects and , hopefully , anticipate new ones . </S>"
