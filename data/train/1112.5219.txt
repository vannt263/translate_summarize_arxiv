    "no long - range magnetic order was found down to @xmath6 k in the neutron diffraction experiments .",
    "however , the analysis of the neutron data depends on the model of the magnetic structure , which is typically assumed in the process of interpretation .",

    "one of them is a complex magnetic ordering , caused by antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions : in the noncentrosymmetric systems , these interactions , of the relativistic origin , can operate between different crystallographic unit cells , thus driving the formation of long - periodic spin - spiral superstructures.@xcite particularly , the idea of the spin - spiral order in various oxide materials has attracted much attention recently in the context of their multiferroic behavior and was proposed as one of the possible origins of such behavior.@xcite    in this paper we will address some basic issues of the formation of the spin - spiral states in pbvo@xmath0 and bicoo@xmath0 .",
    "we will argue that , despite similarities in the lattice distortion and population of the crystal - field levels , these two compounds will behave very differently .",
    "particularly , we will show that the long - periodic spin spiral is a probable candidate for the magnetic ground state of pbvo@xmath0 , where due to the fundamental kramers degeneracy , the single - ion anisotropy does not exists . on the contrary , the spin - spiral state in bicoo@xmath0 (",

    "the magnetic properties of pbvo@xmath0 and bicoo@xmath0 are mainly determined by the behavior of @xmath10-bands located near the fermi level .",
    "therefore , our basic idea of our approach is to construct an effective low - energy model , formulated in the wannier - basis for the @xmath10-bands , and to solve it by using model techniques .",
    "more specifically , we adopt the form of the multiorbital hubbard model on the lattice of transition - metal sites : @xmath11 where we use the shorthand notations , according to which each greek symbol stand for the combination of spin ( @xmath12@xmath13 @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) and orbital ( @xmath16@xmath13 @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 , @xmath22 , or @xmath23@xmath20@xmath24 ) indices . all parameters of the model hamiltonian can be derived in an _ ab initio _ fashion , on the basis of first - principles electronic structure calculations .",
    "for instance , the one - electron part @xmath25 was obtained by using the downfolding procedure , and the coulomb ( and exchange ) interactions @xmath26  by combining the constrained density - functional theory ( dft ) with the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the method was discussed in the literature , and for details the reader is referred to ref .  .",
    "resent applications to multiferroic compounds can be found in refs .   and . in all calculations we use experimental parameters of the crystal structure ,",
    "reported in refs .  .",
    "without spin - orbit interaction , @xmath25 is diagonal with respect to the spin indices @xmath27 .",
    "the site - diagonal part of @xmath28 describes the crystal - field effects , while the off - diagonal part stands for transfer integrals .",
    "the crystal field stabilizes the @xmath17 orbitals ( fig .",
    "[ fig.cf ] ) .",
    "the splitting between @xmath17- and the following after them @xmath18- and @xmath22-orbitals is about 1 ev , both for pbvo@xmath0 and bicoo@xmath0 .",

    ", height=264 ]    the @xmath23@xmath20@xmath24 and @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 orbitals lie in the higher - energy region ( and are substantially higher for pbvo@xmath0 , in comparison with bicoo@xmath0 ) .",
    "thus , from the viewpoint of the crystal - field splitting , pbvo@xmath0 and bicoo@xmath0 are expected to be very similar : pbvo@xmath0 has only one @xmath29-electron , which will occupy the @xmath17 orbital .",
    "amount six @xmath29-electrons of bicoo@xmath0 , the one for the minority - spin states will also occupy the @xmath17 orbital and interact with the spherical @xmath29-electron density of occupied majority - spin shell .",
    "the details of transfer integrals can be found in ref .  .",
    "one of the most interesting features in @xmath30 is the appearance of the so - called ` forbidden hoppings ' , for example between @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 and @xmath22 orbitals in the bond 1 - 2 , which would not exist in the centrosymmetric structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.structure ] for the notations of atomic sites ) .",
    "these transfer integrals have the following form ( in mev ) : @xmath31 and @xmath32 for pbvo@xmath0 and bicoo@xmath0 , respectively , in the basis of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23@xmath20@xmath24 orbitals .",
    "the microscopic origin of such forbidden hoppings was considered in ref .  : due to the parity violation , the wannier orbital , which is formally labeled as `` @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 '' has some weight of the @xmath33 orbitals and , therefore , can interact with the @xmath22 orbitals of the neighboring sites .",
    "such hoppings give rise to the antisymmetric part of @xmath30 , which is responsible for the appearance of dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions .",
    "similar situation takes place in the bonds 1 - 4 and 1 - 5 . on the contrary , due to the rotational symmetry ,",
    "the transfer integrals in the bond 1 - 3 are diagonal with respect to the orbital indices ( the actual values are @xmath34@xmath13 @xmath20@xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath20@xmath37 , @xmath36 , and @xmath20@xmath38 mev for pbvo@xmath0 , and @xmath34@xmath13 @xmath20@xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath20@xmath41 , @xmath40 , and @xmath20@xmath42 mev for bicoo@xmath0  other details can be found in ref .  ) .",
    "therefore , the ` forbidden hoppings ' do not take place and dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions will vanish .    for the relativistic spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) , we adopt two schemes . in the first one ,",
    "we evaluate soi only at the transition - metal sites and add it to the site - diagonal part of @xmath43 in the form @xmath44 , where @xmath45@xmath13 @xmath46 and @xmath47 mev for pbvo@xmath0 and bicoo@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "thus , the effects of the soi are expected to be larger in bicoo@xmath0 : due to large @xmath45 and smaller crystal - field splitting ( fig .",
    "[ fig.cf ] ) , which competes with soi .",
    "if it is not specified otherwise , we will refer to this scheme , for which most of the calculations have been performed . nevertheless , as a test",
    ", we use also the second scheme , where soi was included at all atoms on the level of the band - structure calculations and then corresponding parameters @xmath43 were derived through the downfolding procedure . for example , this schemes takes into account the effect of large soi at heavy atoms pb and bi .    the spin - dependence of coulomb matrix elements has the standard form : @xmath26@xmath48 .",
    "the details of @xmath49 can be found in ref .  .",
    "rough idea about the strength of the matrix elements @xmath49 can be obtained by interpolating them in terms of three characteristic averaged parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which would take place in the centrosymmetrical environment of isolated atoms . in these notations",
    ", @xmath53 is the on - site coulomb interaction , @xmath54 is the intraatomic exchange interaction , and @xmath55 is the ` nonsphericity ' , in terms of radial slater s integrals @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in the other words ,",
    "@xmath50 enforce the charge stability of certain atomic configurations , while @xmath51 and @xmath52 are responsible for the hund rules .",
    "the results of such interpolation are shown in table  [ tab : ujb ] .",
    ".averaged values of the coulomb interaction @xmath50 , exchange interaction @xmath51 , and the nonsphericity @xmath52 , obtained from the fitting of the matrix elements @xmath49 .",
    "all parameters are measured in electron volt . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     they are at least one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath59 for the same bonds .    using these parameters , the spin - spiral vector @xmath60 , can be estimated as @xmath61 ( @xmath62 being the lattice parameter in the @xmath17-plane ) , where @xmath63@xmath13 @xmath64 and @xmath65 for pbvo@xmath0 and bicoo@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "thus , by considering only @xmath59 and @xmath66 , both materials are expected to form spin - spiral structures , involving more than one hundred unit cells .",
    "as we will see below , this scenario indeed holds for pbvo@xmath0 , but not for bicoo@xmath0 .",
    "the main difference between pbvo@xmath0 and bicoo@xmath0 is in the behavior of the single - ion anisotropy @xmath67 .",
    "for the @xmath68 compound pbvo@xmath0 , @xmath67 is expected to be zero as the consequence of fundamental kramers degeneracy for the odd - electron systems .",
    "particularly , the ground state of the self - interaction free ion v@xmath69 is the kramers doublet .",
    "therefore , the rotation of spin corresponds to the unitary transformation of the wave function within this doublet without any energy cost .",
    "the situation is completely different for the @xmath70 ( or even - electron ) compound bicoo@xmath0 : the kramers theorem is no longer valid , which formally allows for the finite @xmath67 .",
    "this statement can be verified by direct calculations of the anisotropy energies @xmath71 ( where the symbols `` @xmath72 '' and `` @xmath73 '' correspond to the spin configurations , where @xmath74 is parallel and perpendicular to the tetragonal @xmath75-axis ) . in the c - type afm state , it yields @xmath76@xmath13 @xmath77 and @xmath20@xmath78 mev per formula unit for pbvo@xmath0 and bicoo@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "moreover , the main contribution to @xmath76 indeed originates from the single - ion anisotropy .",
    "this can be seen by repeating the same calculations in the atomic limit ( and enforcing @xmath30@xmath13@xmath79 for all @xmath80@xmath81@xmath82 ) , which yields @xmath76@xmath13 @xmath79 and @xmath20@xmath83 mev per formula unit for pbvo@xmath0 and bicoo@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "small deviations from the atomic limit are due to intersite ( @xmath80@xmath81@xmath82 ) anisotropic interactions @xmath84 , which can be evaluated in the ` @xmath85'-model and are at least one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath66.@xcite using the obtained values of @xmath76 and the symmetry considerations , nonvanishing parameters of the single - ion anisotropy for bicoo@xmath0 can be estimated as @xmath86@xmath87 mev .",
    "thus , we are dealing the following hierarchy of magnetic interactions @xmath88@xmath89@xmath90@xmath89@xmath91 .",
    "it means that the formation of the spin - spiral state in bicoo@xmath0 is strongly affected by the single - ion anisotropies , which will tend to restore the collinear spin structure by aligning the magnetic moments either parallel or antiparallel to the @xmath75-axis .",
    "of course , the final answer about the from of the magnetic ground state of bicoo@xmath0 can be obtained only on the basis of detailed calculations , which we will discuss in the next section .      in this section",
    "we present results of extensive hartree - fock calculations for large supercells , which allow for the spin - spiral solutions with @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the number of cells along the @xmath94-axis : @xmath95 @xmath96 and @xmath97 corresponds to the right- and left - handed alignment , respectively , and the limit @xmath98 corresponds to the collinear c - type afm state .",
