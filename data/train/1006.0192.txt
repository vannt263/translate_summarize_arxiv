    "the idea that a perturbatively nonrenormalizable theory could be consistently defined in the uv limit at a nontrivial fixed point ( fp ) , often called `` asymptotic safety '' , is theoretically very attractive , especially when applied to quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "much progress in this direction has come from the direct application of renormalization group ( rg ) techniques to gravity .",
    "a particularly useful tool has been the non - perturbative functional renormalization group equation ( frge ) @xcite , defining an rg flow on a theory space which consists of all diffeomorphism invariant functionals of the metric @xmath1 .",
    "it defines a one parameter family of effective field theories with actions @xmath2 depending on a coarse graining scale ( or `` cutoff '' ) @xmath3 , and interpolating between a `` bare '' action ( for @xmath4 ) and the ordinary effective action ( for @xmath5 ) . when applied to the einstein - hilbert action the frge yields beta functions @xcite which have made possible detailed investigations of the scaling behavior of newtons s constant .",
    "it has been shown quite convincingly that the dimensionful newton constant @xmath6 is _ antiscreened _ at high energies , a behavior that eventually leads to the uv fp that is necessary for asymptotic safety .",
    "these analyses have then been enlarged to include matter @xcite and a growing number of purely gravitational operators in the action .",
    "truncations involving terms quadratic in curvature have been considered in @xcite ; even higher operators could be included restricting oneself to powers of the ricci scalar @xcite .",
    "it has also been seen in the latter studies that the dimension of the basin of attraction of the fp ( the so called `` uv critical surface '' ) is likely to be equal to three .",
    "reviews of this work have appeared in @xcite .",
    "the rg flow of the effective average action , obtained by different truncations of theory space , has been the basis of various investigations of  rg improved \" black hole @xcite and cosmological @xcite spacetimes . in particular",
    ", very recently it has been shown that the `` rg improved '' einstein equations admit ( power - law or exponential ) inflationary solutions and that the running of the cosmological constant can account for the entire entropy of the present universe in the massless sector @xcite ( see @xcite for an extended review . )",
    "these works were based on the following logic @xcite .",
    "if we want to study the quantum evolution of the cosmic scale factor , we should in principle use the full effective action @xmath7 , which , as we mentioned above , coincides with @xmath8 in the limit @xmath5 .",
    "however , our knowledge of this functional is rather poor .",
    "one way of gaining some traction on this issue is to observe that the hubble parameter appears as a mass in propagators .",
    "thus , the contributions of quantum fluctuations with wavelenghts greater than @xmath9 are suppressed . as a result , the functional @xmath10 at @xmath3 comparable to @xmath11 should be a reasonable approximation for the same functional at @xmath12 .",
    "we do not know @xmath10 much better than the full effective action , but we can easily calculate the dependence of some terms in @xmath10 on @xmath3 . by doing",
    "so we effectively take into account nonlocal terms that would be very hard to calculate otherwise .",
    "this is analogous to what happens in the discussion of the coleman - weinberg potential : there we restrict ourselves to quartic potentials but we identify the rg scale with the field itself .",
    "since the quartic coupling runs logarithmically , this is equivalent to having a term @xmath13 in the effective action .",
    "previous investigations along these lines , in particular @xcite , have been based on the einstein - hilbert ( eh ) truncation .",
    "it is important to establish that the results obtained there persist when further operators are included in the truncation .",
    "we know that at the fp the coefficients of these terms are not very small , but their presence does not seem to affect the values of the cosmological constant and newton s constant too much . in other words ,",
    "the fp that is is seen in the eh truncation seems to be robust .",
    "the question then is to see if this stability of the fp against the inclusion of new terms is reflected in the stability of the corresponding solutions .",
    "this question is important because the values of the couplings at the fp are fixed and as a consequence there are no free parameters to be varied .",
    "we will see that the ( power - law or exponential ) inflationary solutions are indeed stable against the inclusion of new terms , but establishing this fact requires including a rather large number of terms",
    ".    a somewhat different perspective on this subject has appeared in @xcite .",
    "we will discuss in the conclusions the relation of that approach to the one adopted here .",
    "our work is organized as follows .",
    "first we discuss the equations of motion in the presence of running couplings ( section ii ) , then we specialize the equations to friedmann robertson walker ( frw ) backgrounds ( section iii ) .",
    "section iv is the core of the paper , where we explain in detail our procedure .",
    "the solutions are described in section v. section vi defines a different `` rg improvement '' procedure and discusses the corresponding results .",
    "section vii is devoted to a discussion of the apparent energy nonconservation in the `` rg improved '' theory . in section viii",
    "we compare our approach to other work in the literature and we discuss the main aspects of this work that need further development .",
    "the effective action for the metric containing the effect of matter and graviton fluctuations is a complicated functional consisting of all possible integrals of scalar functions constructed with curvatures and covariant derivatives of curvatures .",
    "if the effective action is evaluated at some reference energy scale @xmath3 , then the couplings appearing in this effective action will in general depend upon @xmath3 .",
    "the dependence of the couplings on @xmath3 is described by @xmath14-functions , which collectively describe the rg flow of the theory .",
    "it is practically impossible to say something on the beta functions of all couplings . in this paper",
    "we will consider a subclass of terms that are somewhat simpler to study than the rest , namely functions of the curvature scalar @xmath15 .",
    "this class of theories has been widely studied in the literature , at least at a classical level ( see for example @xcite for a detailed review ) . for the time being , in order to keep it as generic as possible , we write the action in the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is some function of the scalar curvature . note that even though we will refer to @xmath18 as `` the action '' , we always mean `` the effective average action '' , meaning that fluctuations of the fields with momenta greater than @xmath3 have already been integrated out . from ( [ action ] )",
    "we obtain the equations of motion in the form @xmath19 % & & + f'''(r)\\,(g_{\\mn}r^{;\\r}r_{;\\r}-r_{;\\m}r_{;\\n})=8\\pi gt_{\\mn}-g_{\\mn}\\l\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and we have written the energy - momentum tensor of matter on the right hand side . a prime stands for the derivative with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "we want to use these equations to describe the cosmological evolution of the early universe .",
    "the `` rg improved '' cosmological equations will be obtained by replacing the gravitational couplings ( cosmological constant , newton s constant etc . ) by running couplings .",
    "insofar as the cutoff scale is identified with a function of the metric , and the metric is itself a function of the coordinates , the running couplings will also be functions of the coordinates .",
    "we will discuss some other general consequences of this assumption in section vii ; for the time being we just proceed assuming that the function @xmath17 appearing in ( [ motiongeneral ] ) is built with such coordinate - dependent couplings , and that this dependence has to be taken into account when taking its derivatives . to be more explicit ,",
    "if we assume that @xmath21 can be represented by a series of the form @xmath22 then @xmath23\\ ] ] while this seems to us the most natural and correct procedure , it is not a priori obvious that leaving out the last term ( i.e. performing the `` rg improvement '' after having taken the derivatives ) would necessarily be wrong . in order not to burden the reader with a doubling of all results , in most of this paper we shall follow the former procedure , and then devote section vi to a discussion of the results using the latter .",
    "fortunately , we will see that several results are largely independent of this choice .",
    "in the following we will parametrize the action as follows : @xmath24 then ( [ motiongeneral ] ) takes the following form @xmath25 & & + \\frac{\\nabla_\\nu g}{g}\\nabla_\\mu f'(r)-2\\frac{\\nabla^\\rho g}{g}\\nabla_\\rho f'(r)g_{\\mu\\nu } -f'(r ) g\\big ( \\nabla_\\mu\\nabla_\\nu \\frac{1}{g}-g_{\\mu\\nu } \\nabla^2 \\frac{1}{g } \\big)\\\\[2 mm ] & & = 8\\pi gt_{\\mn}-\\l g_{\\mn}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will set @xmath0 to be a polynomial of degree @xmath26 , and write it as @xmath27 with @xmath28 by definition .",
    "again , it is understood that when derivatives act on @xmath0 , also the couplings @xmath29 have to be derived .",
    "as we are interested in the cosmological evolution , we specialize to a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker metric and take @xmath30 to be the energy momentum tensor of an ideal fluid with equation of state @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a constant .",
    "normally at very high energy it is natural to assume @xmath33 , and we will mostly do so .",
    "however , this is just an approximate description of the matter content of the universe . as we shall discuss in section vii ,",
    "due to the coarse graining the energy momentum tensor could have unusual properties and the effective @xmath34 could be different from its classical value .",
    "in a frw cosmology with scale factor @xmath35 we can write both @xmath36 and @xmath37 in terms of the hubble rate @xmath38 . in particular , we have @xmath39 & & r = r^{\\m}_{\\phantom{\\m}\\m}=6(\\dot{h}+2h^2 ) , \\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\box r=-\\ddot r- 3h\\dot{r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the @xmath40-component and ( minus ) the trace of ( [ motionext ] ) become @xmath41 where @xmath42    one can eliminate @xmath43 from ( [ e2 ] ) , thus obtaining an equation that determines @xmath35 , while ( [ e1 ] ) is used to determine @xmath43 : @xmath44    the equations for the case without matter can be obtained by setting @xmath45 in ( [ e1],[e2 ] )",
    ". then @xmath35 can be obtained by solving @xmath46 while either ( [ e1 ] ) or ( [ e2 ] ) provide an additional equation that involves @xmath47 .",
    "as we shall see , this system is quite constraining .",
    "the rg flow for @xmath21 theories of gravity has been studied in @xcite .",
    "one can actually derive a beta functional for the entire function @xmath17 , but the corresponding fp equation is very complicated , so the analysis has been done by expanding @xmath17 in taylor series .",
    "it has proved possible to study truncations involving up to eight powers of @xmath15 .",
    "we now recall the results of this analysis , in the parametrization provided by equations ( [ parametrization ] ) and ( [ polyf ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic safety scenario posits that in the ultraviolet the couplings reach a fixed point .",
    "this statement has the obvious meaning when applied to dimensionless couplings such as the electromagnetic coupling , or the quartic coupling in scalar field theory . in the case of dimensionful couplings , it means that they must tend to constant values _",
    "when measured in units of the cutoff_. we call @xmath3 the cutoff , and we denote by a tilde the ratio of any quantity by the cutoff raised to the canonical dimension of that quantity . thus quantities with a tilde are by definition dimensionless . for example",
    "@xmath48 is the curvature measured in cutoff units , and @xmath49 are the couplings measured in cutoff units . in the following",
    "we will refer to them as `` the dimensionless couplings '' .",
    "it is paramount to understand that the existence of a fixed point refers not to the dimensionful couplings such as @xmath47 , @xmath6 etc .",
    "but to their dimensionless counterparts @xmath50 , @xmath51 etc . as a result , at a fixed point the dimensionful couplings",
    "do run quite violently , namely they depend on the cutoff precisely as dictated by naive dimensional analysis .",
    "this is to be contrasted to the low energy regime we are familiar with , where the opposite happens : the dimensionful couplings do not run , and consequently the dimensionless ones have a very strong classical running .",
    "we now come to the fixed point of @xmath21 gravity .",
    "the values of the dimensionless couplings at the fixed point , for various polynomial truncations of order up to ten , are listed in table 1 .",
    "the first eight lines are taken from @xcite . for reasons that will be discussed in section v.b , these truncations are actually insufficient for our purposes and",
    "we have found it necessary to examine also the truncations @xmath52 .",
    "all the other details of the calculation ( cutoff , gauge etc . ) are the same as in @xcite .",
    "we have found only the two fixed points listed in the last two lines in the table .",
    "we have not calculated the critical exponents that pertain to these fixed points , so our understanding of their nature is less complete than for the truncations @xmath53 , but the close resemblance of the values of most couplings is a strong hint that these are indeed the correct prolongations of the @xmath54 fixed point to higher truncations .. in this connection we note that the coefficients arise from the sum of a large number of terms and that there is nothing to guarantee their sign .",
    "the actual difference between @xmath55 in the truncations @xmath54 and @xmath56 is 0.08 ; similar shifts occur also elsewhere in the table . ]",
    ".position of the fp as a function of @xmath26 , the order of the truncation . to avoid writing too many decimals , the values of @xmath57",
    "have been multiplied by 1000 .

    "then we have to solve the equations @xmath60 when one uses ( [ adef ] ) , ( [ bdef ] ) , ( [ polyf ] ) , ( [ various ] ) and ( [ cutoff ] ) , for dimensional reasons these equations reduce to the product of some power of @xmath61 times a function of @xmath62 and @xmath63 . solving them for all",
    "@xmath61 means that @xmath62 and @xmath63 must satisfy two algebraic equations , and one expects to find at most isolated solutions . at least for @xmath64",
    "no solutions were found .     for @xmath65 , @xmath33 .",
    "the dashed curve indicates @xmath66 .",
    "the grey region represents the region excluded by the reliability criterion , see ( [ bound ] ) with @xmath67 .",
    ", width=377,height=226 ]    let us now search for power law solutions in the presence of matter .",
    "things now look better because matter gives us a new degree of freedom and allows us to find solutions for continuous ranges of values of @xmath63 .",
    "namely , for fixed @xmath63 one can use equation ( [ eqn2sqr ] ) to determine the exponent @xmath62 and then use ( [ eqn2rho ] ) to fix @xmath68 . in this way one avoids having to fix @xmath63 .",
    "the case @xmath64 has already been discussed in section 5.2 .",
    "the cases with @xmath69 can not be solved analytically , but solutions exist and can be found numerically . as before we use @xmath33 .    doing this highlights once again the need to go beyond the truncation @xmath54 . for suppose that we only knew the results up to @xmath54",
    "then according to our criteria we would have to take for this truncation the same reliability range as the @xmath70 truncation , which has a smaller value @xmath71 . with this criterion ,",
    "the whole @xmath54 solution that asymptotes to de sitter would be unreliable .",
    "it is only by going to higher @xmath26 that we can validate the solution in an acceptable range .",
    "we note that part of these curves lie still to the left of the reliability limit ( [ boundp ] ) , but that is the part that is less interesting physically . as a confirmation of the results , we show in figure 5 the exponents @xmath62 in the truncation @xmath65 .",
    "let us return to equation ( [ motiongeneral ] ) .",
    "as we mentioned , there is a possible ambiguity concerning the stage at which one should replace the usual `` constant '' couplings by time dependent `` running '' couplings . to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us consider for a moment the special case of the einstein - hilbert action , @xmath72 .",
    "if we were to simply `` rg improve '' einstein s equations , as in @xcite , we would have @xmath73 where @xmath6 is now allowed to depend on @xmath74 .",
    "this is different from the procedure that we followed in this paper , which leads to the general equations @xmath75 for want of a better terminology we will refer to these two procedures as the `` restricted '' or the `` extensive '' improvement respectively . at least at the level of the einstein - hilbert truncation",
    "it is not a priori clear that one of these procedures is right and the other wrong .",
    "for example , one may derive einstein s equations from arguments unrelated to an action , then the first choice seems a legitimate one .    equation ( [ sonia ] ) has been written before in @xcite , where the restricted improvement is referred to as `` improving equations '' and the extensive improvement as `` improving actions '' .",
    "this terminology is unambiguous in the case of the einstein - hilbert action , but it is ambiguous when one considers more general actions such as ( [ action ] ) : in fact is quite clear that also the extensive improvement could very well be described as `` improving equations '' , when the equation is written in the form ( [ motiongeneral ] ) .",
    "also , while our extensive improvement may well be seen as replacing the constant couplings by position - dependent couplings in the action , the procedure that we have followed has been quite different from the one advocated in @xcite , because we have not treated the position - dependent couplings as prescribed external functions .",
    "having hopefully clarified the differences in these various approaches , in the absence of a very strong a priori argument against the restricted improvement , in this section we will describe the results that one obtains from it .",
    "the equations of motion are of the form ( [ motiongeneral ] ) where , now , @xmath76    let us now discuss solutions .",
    "first we observe that in the search of de sitter solutions , the difference between the extensive and the restricted improvement is immaterial . to see this compare the difference between the definition of @xmath77 in the two cases .",
    "this difference is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 means that one only takes the derivative with respect to @xmath61 of @xmath15 and not of the couplings .",
    "each term in this expression contains at least one time derivative of @xmath11 and therefore vanishes for de sitter space .",
    "thus , also with the restricted improvement the de sitter solutions are given by table 2 .",
    "when we look for power law solutions , additional solutions appear for @xmath80 .",
    "we consider first the case @xmath64 .",

    "figures 6 gives the exponents as functions of @xmath63 in the cases @xmath54 and @xmath65 respectively .",
    "we note that there is a solution that starts at @xmath88 for @xmath89 and has the same de sitter asymptote as the one found with the extensive improvement .",
    "these solutions are very close in the domain of reliability of the truncation .",
    "there is then another solution which starts at @xmath90 for @xmath89 and has @xmath91 for @xmath92 , and whose physical meaning is doubtful .",
    "we conclude that the physically most relevant part of the solution is rather insensitive to the choice between extensive and restricted improvement .     of power law solutions as a function of @xmath63 for @xmath65 , @xmath33 , using the restricted improvement .",

    "the grey region represents the region excluded by the reliability criterion , see ( [ bound ] ) with @xmath67 .",
    ", width=377,height=226 ]",
    "one somewhat unsettling aspect of this approach to cosmology is non - conservation of the energy momentum . from equation ( [ motiongeneral ] )",
    "one finds that @xmath93 and both sides of the equation would vanish if they were obtained by varying a diffeomorphism invariant action .",
    "but the rg improved equations were not simply obtained by varying a diffeomorphism invariant action : after the variation , the couplings , which are usually treated as constants , were replaced by functions of the metric .",
    "of course if we replaced the couplings by scalar functions of the metric in the action , before varying , then we would obtain another diffeomorphism invariant action .",
    "but this is not the procedure that we use here , so one should not expect the l.h.s . of ( [ conservation ] ) to be zero . as a consequence , also the r.h.s",
    ". can not be zero , so the energy momentum tensor on the r.h.s .",
    "of the rg improved equations can not be obtained from varying some diffeomorphism invariant matter action .",
    "let us calculate the l.h.s . of ( [ conservation ] ) . since @xmath94 is linear in @xmath17 , it is easiest to do this when the function @xmath17 has a taylor expansion as in ( [ seriesf ] )",
    ". then one finds @xmath95 where @xmath96 means that the derivative acts only on the couplings and not on @xmath15 : @xmath97 this equation has a very simple interpretation : the failure of energy - momentum conservation ( a gravitational anomaly ) is proportional to the beta functions of the couplings .    at this point",
    "it is important to stress that we are not claiming to have found a violation of energy momentum conservation at a fundamental level .",
    "if , as we said in the introduction , we were using the full effective action ( namely the functional @xmath10 at @xmath12 ) , then there would be no rg improvement and , barring the occurrence of genuine gravitational anomalies ( as discussed for example in @xcite ) , there would be no anomaly because the full effective action is diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "so the type of gravitational anomaly that we are discussing here is entirely due to the rg improvement and the associated coarse graining .    to further discuss this point",
    "we can recast ( [ motionext ] ) in the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 \\nonumber\\\\[2 mm ] & & -\\frac{\\nabla_\\mu g}{g}\\frac{\\nabla_\\nu f'(r)}{f'(r ) } -\\frac{\\nabla_\\nu g}{g}\\frac{\\nabla_\\mu f'(r)}{f'(r ) } + 2\\frac{\\nabla^\\rho g}{g}\\frac{\\nabla_\\rho f'(r)}{f'(r)}g_{\\mu\\nu } \\\\",

    "it is thus clear that a non - vanishing @xmath101 exactly compensates the nonconservation of @xmath102 , so that the _ total _ effective stress - energy tensor @xmath103 given from the r.h.s of ( [ bella ] ) is conserved , in general .",
    "one can think of @xmath104 as the stress - energy tensor for a _ dissipative _ , i.e. non - ideal fluid which interacts with the coarse grained gravitational degrees of freedom .",
    "in fact in the functional @xmath10 modes with wavelengths smaller that @xmath105 are integrated over .",
    "since @xmath3 is identified with @xmath11 , it decreases with time and therefore , as time proceeds , more and more gravitational modes are being removed from the description of the system .",
    "such modes carry energy and it should not be surprising that when they are removed energy seems not to be conserved .",
    "although in this paper we have considered the coarse - graining of the modes of the gravitational field , similar considerations would apply also to matter fields .",
    "it is interesting to review how this happens already in the more familiar framework of wilson s action for the @xmath106 scalar field theory .",
    "quite generally , the wilsonian action in this case can be defined as @xmath107 } = \\int d[\\varphi ] \\prod_{x } \\delta   ( \\phi_k(x)-\\phi(x ) ) e^{-s[\\varphi ] } \\equiv \\int d[\\varphi ] e^{-s_k[\\varphi , \\phi]}\\ ] ] where @xmath108 is the average of the field @xmath109 in a domain of characteristic length @xmath110 . for actual calculation",
    "it is possible to introduce a smearing function @xmath111 which is nearly constant within distances shorter than @xmath110 but rapidly decays to zero outside this region , so that we write @xmath112 one can evaluate the on - shell condition for the blocked action ( [ block ] ) by means of the standard saddle - point approximation @xmath113}{\\delta \\phi}$ ] ( see @xcite for details ) which gives @xmath114 the non - local contribution coming from the coarse - graining kernel acts as a source terms in the equation of motion for the effective theory at the scale @xmath3 .",
    "this is responsible for a modification of the standard conservation law which now reads @xmath115 where @xmath104 is the stress - energy tensor of the original ( bare ) field @xmath109 .",
    "it should be noticed that in the limit @xmath116 , @xmath117 and one recovers the standard conservation law with no additional source term .",
    "let us now see in detail how the modified conservation law arise in the case of the einstein - hilbert truncation .",
    "the rg improved friedmann equations read @xmath118 taking the derivative of the first equation and using again both equations , one is led to the following modified continuity equation @xmath119 where @xmath120 -\\frac{3 \\dot g}{8\\pi g^2 } \\left[\\dot h + \\frac{h \\dot g } { g } + h^2\\right]\\ ] ] the l.h.s .",
    "is just @xmath121 , so this equation agrees exactly with the time component of ( [ conservation ] ) , when we use the definitions @xmath122 is is important to stress that this expression can consistently be obtained from the 4-divergence of eq.([bella ] ) , as it must be for consistence .",
    "note that we do not use the additional consistency condition described in @xcite as we allow for an unobstructed exchange of energy between matter and the gravitational effective dynamics .",
    "the first term in square brackets in the r.h.s of ( [ calp ] ) had already appeared in @xcite , but the second one is due to the different improvement scheme used here .",
    "we will discuss these differences in some detail the next section .",
    "here we recall from @xcite that the time variation of the couplings , and in particular of the cosmological constant , can be seen as a transfer of energy to the matter degrees of freedom and hence gives rise to an increase in entropy of the cosmological fluid .",
    "in fact it was shown that essentially all of the entropy that is observed can be accounted for in this way .",
    "we note that this calculation , which is given in equations ( 3.9)-(3.15 ) in @xcite , does not depend on the form of @xmath123 as a function of @xmath124 and @xmath125 , so the entropy generation will be the same in the approach followed here .",
    "in fact , as discussed in @xcite , the peak of the entropy production is in the crossover region , near the gaussian fixed point , where only the running of the cosmological constant is relevant and @xmath126 .",
    "we now give the formula for energy ( non)conservation in the general case . in general we can write @xmath127 then using @xmath128 and the explicit expressions ( [ adef],[bdef ] ) , one finds @xmath129\\ ] ] this agrees with the result of inserting ( [ parametrization ] ) into ( [ bianchi ] ) .",
    "we can see the implications of these facts for the search of cosmological solutions at the fixed point . at a fixed point",
    "we have @xmath130 so inserting in ( [ bianchi ] ) we find @xmath131 there are therefore two ways in which the anomaly could vanish : the first is that @xmath132 , which is satisfied if and only if @xmath133 .",
    "this is because @xmath134 is dimensionless , and therefore it is constant at a fixed point .",
    "the other way , which could work for any form of the function @xmath17 , is that @xmath135 .",
    "this depends on the choice of the cutoff , i.e. how it depends on the metric , and on the solution .",
    "in particular , if we look for vacuum solutions @xmath136 , we must also have @xmath137 .",
    "vacuum solutions must have a vanishing anomaly and this is why they are harder to come by than solutions with matter . if we make the cutoff identification @xmath138 , and if @xmath17 is not just @xmath139 , then a necessary condition to have a vacuum solution is @xmath140 , so the only vacuum solution is de sitter .",
    "the ( non)conservation of the energy momentum tensor with a restricted improvement works in a different way . instead of ( [ bianchi ] )",
    "we find now @xmath141 note that only the second term is present if we perform the extensive improvement .",
    "the new terms that are seen here can be viewed as additional contributions to the anomaly .",
    "finally let us discuss the energy density that is required for the existence of the power law solutions .",
    "once the solution for @xmath35 is found , one can plug it in ( [ eqn2rho ] ) to obtain @xmath43 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath43 always depends on time as @xmath142 , as demanded by dimensional analysis , so the only issue is the value of the constant prefactor .",
    "explicit formulae are easily derived in the case @xmath143 .",
    "one finds @xmath144 in the extended rg improvement scheme and @xmath145 in the restricted improvement scheme .",
    "note that the additional term proportional to @xmath125 , which is present in the former case , is negative , making the density @xmath43 negative in the former case and positive in the latter .",
    "these facts signal that a detailed analysis of the matter sector is necessary .",
    "we shall not undertake this analysis here , leaving it for future work .",
    "we just add a few remarks .",
    "it is not difficult to see that one can have positive energy also with the extended improvement , provided @xmath34 is smaller than a critical value @xmath146 .",
    "furthermore , in a more refined treatment we should perform the coarse - graining also on the matter , treated as quantum fields . on the other hand",
    ", it can be argued that the realistic rg trajectory is the one which emanates from the non - gaussian fp and spends a long time near the gaussian fixed point , corresponding to the classical era @xcite . during this time @xmath147 and",
    "one recovers the more familiar `` restricted '' rg evolution where the density is always positive .",
    "the results obtained here can be summarized by saying that if we identify the cutoff with a multiple of the hubble parameter , as in ( [ cutoff ] ) , inflationary power law solutions ( i.e. with exponent @xmath91 ) exist for @xmath148 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath63 is strong , with the exponent diverging at @xmath149 .",
    "exactly at that point , the theory admits a de sitter solution .",
    "provided that @xmath63 lies in the above range , that the starting point is close enough to the fp and that @xmath91 , it should always be possible to have a sufficient number of @xmath150-foldings .",
    "weinberg @xcite has studied the frw equations that follow from a general gravitational action containing arbitrary powers of curvature , and the possibility that they admit inflationary ( de sitter ) solutions . in his approach",
    "the cutoff is a fixed mass scale that has to be optimized for the treatment of inflation . unlike the approach followed here ,",
    "it does not depend on time and therefore there are no `` rg improvement '' terms in the equations .",
    "this may sound like a very different procedure , but in practice it is not , for two reasons .",
    "the first is that the fixed optimal cutoff is tuned to a description of inflation , and if one wanted a cutoff that is tuned to some later stage of the cosmic history , it would be different ; thus effectively one would have again a time - dependent cutoff .",
    "conversely , when we focus only on de sitter solutions , also our time - dependent cutoff @xmath138 becomes time - independent .",
    "therefore , if one started with the equations of @xcite and truncated the action to the form @xmath21 that we consider here , then one would find the same solutions .",
    "the equations of motion determine @xmath11 as a function of the cutoff , so if we assume that the cutoff is a multiple of @xmath11 , the coefficient @xmath63 is determined by the solution , as we have observed .",
    "it is worth noting that the value of @xmath63 that produces a de sitter solution is in the right physical range , namely the cutoff retains fluctuations with wavelengths that are few times smaller that the horizon scale .    in this work",
    "we have discussed the effect of performing the rg improvement in the equations of motion , after having varied the action . to see how things could work in a different approach ,",
    "let us momentarily view equation ( [ expeq ] ) as a differential equation for @xmath151 ( instead of an algebraic equation for @xmath15 , as we have looked at it so far ) .",
    "it has the solution @xmath152 , @xmath153 , which corresponds to a scale invariant theory .",
    "( we have also seen in section vii that in this case the anomaly automatically vanishes . ) for such an @xmath151 , de sitter space is a solution for any value of @xmath15 , and @xmath154 remains undetermined .",
    "we observe that this theory can be obtained if we make the rg improvement in the action , before varying .",
    "in fact , if we make the cutoff identification @xmath155 , in the fixed point regime @xmath156 , so @xmath157 note that since the fixed point coefficients @xmath158 seem to be all less than one , and to have alternating signs , with @xmath159 there is reasonable hope that the series converges .",
    "the same behavior obtains with the cutoff identification ( [ cutoff ] ) , if one restricts onself to de sitter spaces .",
    "this result also agrees with the expectation that the fixed point should be described by a scale invariant action .",
    "cosmological solutions of this theory have been studied in @xcite .",
    "there are properties of the theory that are not universal , but depend on the choice of the cutoff .",
    "clearly , it will be important to check that the observable low - energy physics is not strongly dependent on the regulator choice , but this question can only be addressed with a proper numerical integration of the complete system of improved rg equations and the @xmath160-functions for the couplings .",
    "one aspect of the problem that we have not touched upon here is the end of inflation . in @xcite",
    "this is estimated by considering the development of instabilities in the exponential solution . in the approach that we followed here",
    "one would assume that the initial point of the rg evolution is not _ at _ the fixed point but somewhere close to it .",
    "the solutions described here would then hold only approximately .",
    "the rg evolution would take the theory away from the fixed point , with a speed that can be calculated from knowledge of the scaling exponents of the theory .",
    "eventually when one gets sufficiently far from the fixed point the inflationary solution would give way to an ordinary radiation dominated universe .",
    "one would think that by choosing the initial point sufficiently close to the fixed point one can have an inflationary period of arbitrarily long duration .",
    "of course the two approaches should give at least similar results .",
    "we hope to return to this point in the future .",
    "unfortunately the results of this paper are not yet a realistic basis for a model of inflation .",
    "the main reason is that we are neglecting a great number of terms in the action .",
    "for the study of robertson - walker cosmologies , weyl terms are unimportant , and for @xmath64 ( meaning with four derivatives ) there is nothing beyond @xmath161 that is not a total derivative .",
    "however from @xmath162 upwards there are many terms in the action that contain traces of powers of the ricci tensor , whose effect we are currently unable to estimate .",
    "one rather sobering result of our analysis has been that in order to find reliable solutions one has to go to really high orders in the derivative expansion .",
    "it is encouraging , however , that the ( technically unreliable ) results of the einstein - hilbert truncation @xcite proved in the end to give the correct qualitative picture ( at least within the class of @xmath21 truncations ) .",
    "one may hope that also when ricci terms are included , the results of the low order truncations are not too misleading .",
