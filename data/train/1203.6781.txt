    "the production of charm quarks in association with electroweak gauge bosons at hadron colliders can provide important information on strange and charm quark pdfs , complementary to that obtained by tagging charm quarks in the final state in deep inelastic scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the tevatron cdf and d0 experiments @xcite have measured the cross section for charm quarks produced in association with @xmath4 bosons , using muon tagging of the charm - quark jet . however",
    "the accuracy of these measurements is limited to @xmath530% by low statistics .",
    "the lhc is expected to provide a more precise measurement , and indeed the cms collaboration has recently performed a similar study @xcite of @xmath6 production , again using muons to tag the charm quark jet in the final state .    at leading order ( lo ) , the feynman diagrams for charm production in association with a w boson are shown in fig .",
    "the dominant contribution comes from strange quark ",
    "gluon scattering , as the corresponding down - quark contribution is strongly cabibbo suppressed .",
    "production at leading order . ]",
    "the cross section for @xmath2 production ( where @xmath7 denotes a tagged charm - quark jet ) is measured in ref .",
    "@xcite ( cdf ) , while ref .",
    "@xcite ( d0 ) introduces the ratio of charm jets to all jets , which is expected to suffer less from both experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "cms has performed a similar analysis  @xcite using the 2010 lhc data set .    also of interest",
    "is charm production in association with @xmath8 bosons .",
    "the leading - order process is simply @xmath9 , and so this process can be used to extract information on the charm quark pdf .",
    "it is important to note that for both @xmath2 and @xmath10 production at hadron colliders , the strange and charm quarks are probed at much higher @xmath3 ( @xmath11  gev@xmath12 ) values than in the traditional determinations from deep inelastic scattering , i.e. @xmath13 and @xmath14 where typically @xmath15  gev@xmath12 ) . taken together , the measurements therefore also test dglap evolution for these quark flavours .    in this letter",
    "we study @xmath16-jet production in the context of the cms analysis  @xcite , analysing the different quark contributions and comparing the predictions of various widely - used pdf sets .",
    "we also study the corresponding cross - section ratio for @xmath10-jet production , which should be measurable with the 2011 lhc data set .",
    "the two relevant cross - section ratios introduced by cms  @xcite are : @xmath18 the advantage of using ratios is that many of the theoretical and experimental uncertainties cancel . in particular , the ratios are fairly insensitive to higher - order perturbative qcd corrections .",
    "note that @xmath19 at the tevatron .",
    "we calculate the cross sections at nlo pqcd using mcfm  @xcite , applying the cms cuts @xcite to the final - state : @xmath20 gev , @xmath21 , @xmath22 gev , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "five different nlo pdf sets are used : ct10  @xcite , mstw2008  @xcite , nnpdf2.1 @xcite , gjr08  @xcite and abkm09  @xcite , as implemented in lhapdf  @xcite .",
    "the renormalisation and factorisation scales are set to @xmath26 , although the cross - section ratios are rather insensitive to this choice .",
    "( we have also considered dynamical scales of the form @xmath27 , but the differences for the cross - section ratios are similar in magnitude to the pdf uncertainties . )    the results are summarised in table [ fractions2 ] where we also include the ratio : @xmath28    .comparison of results for the cross - section ratios defined in ( [ eq : wcratios ] ) and ( [ eq : wpmrat ] ) at nlo using different pdf sets , including 68%cl ( asymmetric , where available ) pdf errors . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in principle @xmath29 provides direct information on the charm content of the proton , complementary to that obtained from dis experiments via @xmath30 .",
    "( -240,-95 )    we note that the differences between the predictions of different pdf sets are much smaller than for the strange quark distributions , presumably because in all these global fits the charm distributions arise perturbatively from @xmath31 splitting , with the small-@xmath32 gluon well determined from the hera structure function data .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ charm1 ] , which compares the ratio of charm quarks to all quarks for the three pdf sets .",
    "when pdf errors are taken into account the three sets are very difficult to distinguish , and this is reflected in the similarity in the @xmath29 predictions in table  [ zres ] .",
    "the use of @xmath33 as a pdf discriminator will therefore require a very precise measurement .",
    "we can also consider the ( charm ) charge asymmetry ratio : @xmath34 at first sight it might appear that @xmath35 is automatically equal to 1 , but this is only true if @xmath36 in the initial state .",
    "this is indeed the case for all the pdf sets considered here , since as already noted the charm distributions are generated by charge symmetric @xmath37 splitting .",
    "however this symmetry does not necessarily hold if we allow for an _ intrinsic _ charm component  @xcite .",
    "pdf studies incorporating intrinsic charm , see for example  @xcite , suggest that it is probably a small effect compared to perturbatively generated charm , particularly at the small @xmath32 values relevant to the lhc . in any case ,",
    "any such intrinsic charm analysis is highly model dependent , and beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "we do note however that in the process @xmath38 , which dominates @xmath39jet production over most of the kinematic range at the lhc , the @xmath40 is more likely to be positively charged than negatively charged , and the @xmath41jet is therefore more likely to contain a @xmath42 ( say ) than a @xmath43 . hence there may well be a natural charge asymmetry in the misidentified charm - jet background .",
    "finally we can also compare the ratios : @xmath44 the nlo predictions for mstw2008nlo are 0.045 and 0.082 respectively , for the selection cuts described above for @xmath4 and @xmath8 including leptonic decays .",
    "we can relate the ratio of these ratios to the ratio of @xmath45 over @xmath46 which can be read from figs .",
    "[ strerr ] and [ charm1 ] at the appropriate momentum fraction .",
    "of course in practice it is more complicated , as multiple scales , momentum fractions and couplings are involved , but an estimate @xmath47 can be extracted for this ratio and this matches well with the 0.082/0.045 ratio above .",
    "we have investigated charm production in association with @xmath4 and @xmath8 bosons at the lhc .",
    "we have presented predictions relevant to the recent ( and ongoing ) cms analysis for @xmath4 bosons produced in association with a charm - quark jet .",
    "use of a larger lhc data sample should lead to precise measurements of the ratios @xmath33 and @xmath48 which can in turn provide useful information on the strange content of the proton , and in particular the asymmetry between @xmath49 and @xmath50 at small @xmath32 and high @xmath3 .",
    "we have also shown results for several differential distributions that can in principle be used to provide additional information on the @xmath32 dependence of the strange and anti - strange quark distributions .",
    "we also propose a measurement of the corresponding ratio for z bosons , @xmath29 , which can be used as a measure of the charm content of the proton .",
    "finally , we note that information on the strange quark content of the proton can also be obtained by comparing the _ total _ @xmath4 and @xmath8 cross sections at the lhc , see for example the recent atlas study reported in @xcite .",
    "this exploits the fact that the dependence on the strange pdf is linear for the @xmath4 and quadratic for the @xmath8 : @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "the method is complementary to the charm - jet tagging method discussed in the present study , and it will be interesting to compare the results from the two analyses when more precise data become available .",
    "useful discussions with isabel josa and robert thorne are acknowledged .",
