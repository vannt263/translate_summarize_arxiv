    "gamma - ray emission from solar flares is generally believed to occur predominantly in compact high - density regions near the photospheric footpoints of magnetic field lines .",
    "observations of gamma - ray emission from flares whose host active regions are located behind the visible solar disk pose interesting questions regarding the acceleration sites and mechanism , the transport and interaction points of the accelerated particles during these rare events .",
    "three behind - the - limb ( btl ) flares with emission up to 100  mev were observed during solar cycles 21 and 22 . the first occulted solar flare",
    "whose active region ( ar ) was estimated to be 15@xmath2 behind the western limb was observed on 1989 september 29 by the gamma - ray spectrometer ( grs ) on - board the _ solar maximum mission ( smm)_. @xcite reported intense gamma - ray line emission in the 18 mev range and a strong 2.223 mev neutron capture line from this flare . given the strength of the line emission it was concluded that a spatially extended component was required in order to explain the observations .",

    "these are referred to as partially occulted flares since only the emission from the loop footpoints are occulted .",

    "is limited we can not constrain the acceleration , transport or radiation processes .",
    "however this flare is remarkable because the ar being located beyond the western limb provided good magnetic connection with the earth and as a result it was associated with a very strong sep event and increased the neutron flux in the south pole neutron monitor .",

    "thus , we do not have reliable sep data to test whether the onset times of the sep and gamma - rays coincide , however we can compare the height of the cme at the time of the gamma - ray onset with the cme height at spr found for jan14 . based on the 2@xmath62 order fit of height as a function of time ( from the lasco cme online catalog ) we estimated that the cme was at @xmath52.5at the onset time of the _ fermi_-lat emission .",

    "the second possibility is in the weak diffusion limit @xmath86 , where trapping can occur if the field lines converge strongly . in this case",

    "( with proportionality constant @xmath88 increasing with increasing field convergence  @xcite ) .",
    "these are somewhat extreme conditions requiring either a very high density ( therefore increasing the scattering , presumably turbulence ) or a somewhat strong field convergence and a  clean \" loop with low density and low level of turbulence .      based on the positions of the _ fermi_-lat @xmath4100  mev emission centroids alone we can not exclude that the gamma rays come from the loop - top source . in order to investigate this possibility we rely on equation  [ eq : couldepth ] to find the column depth required to stop @xmath89 mev protons ( that produce @xmath0 mev photons ) and find @xmath90 @xmath76 .",
    "this is much larger than the loop - top column depth @xmath91 @xmath76 so that , in the absence of trapping , we are again dealing with a thin target loop - top source and a small energy loss compared to what would be the case for emission from a thick target photospheric source .",
    "consequently , we would need much larger energies of accelerated protons than those given in table  [ tab : btlquantities ] assuming a thick target scenario .",
    "the condition for proton trapping in the loop - top ( or any coronal trap region , for that matter ) is also more extreme than that described above for electrons and we would need escape times @xmath92 times longer than the crossing time . _",
    "thus , the emission detected by the _ fermi_-lat is most likely due to decay of pions produced by energetic protons interacting in a thick - target photospheric source . _",
    "as shown in @xcite and @xcite in a thin target scenario the relation between the hxr spectral index , @xmath93 , and the number index of the energy spectrum of the emitting electrons index , which in non relativistic limit is @xmath94 used commonly . in the relativistic regime",

    "* ) and semi - relativistic cases      we will use these relations in the following for the interpretation of the detected emission from the two brightest behind - the - limb flares reported in this work .",

    "we found that the inclusion of a 2.223 mev broad neutron capture line and the nuclear de - excitation lines did not improve the fit significantly and that the best - fit model for the emission observed by _",

    "the emission detected by the san vito station has an index @xmath109 above 1 ghz .",

    ", the steepening would be even larger ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "_ thus , for the sep14 flare a power - law spectrum , steepening at higher energies , is required to explain the hxr and microwave observations from the loop - top region .",
    "this plus a pion decay component provides an acceptable fit to the fermi data from 30 kev to several gev .",
    "_      the above interpretation of the hxr and microwave emissions indicates that the electrons responsible for these emissions are most likely accelerated in the reconnection region above the loop - top source either by turbulence  @xcite or in merging islands manifested in the particle - in - cell simulations  @xcite .",
    "the electrons are trapped in the loop - top region long enough ( longer than the crossing time of a fraction of second ) to produce detectable bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation , but most of their energy is lost in thick - target footpoints hidden from near earth instruments because of high optical depths  @xcite .",
    "this scenario can also explain the hxr emission from a btl flare reported by @xcite .",
    "the steepening of the electron spectrum in the semi - relativistic regime is due to a decrease in the acceleration rate and not to transport or energy loss effects .    if the _",
    "fermi_-lat emission is from a thick - target photospheric site , then this emission site is located on the visible part of the disk .",
    "it can not come from the occulted ar .",

    ". they would diffuse across a wide range of magnetic fields , some connected to the ar behind the limb and some to the visible side of the sun .",
    "these ions will most likely come from the down - stream region of the cme shock while seps escape the upstream region .",
    "this can account for the differences in their spectral and temporal characteristics .",
    "it is then possible that the discrepancy between the spectral characteristics in 110 mev for the gbm and radio observations can be explained by lower - energy 1100 mev protons or electrons precipitating to the visible disk side from the down - stream region and producing the 110 mev nuclear de - excitation line or bremsstrahlung emission below the chromosphere . these and other possibilities , for example , production of the _ fermi_-lat emission by relativistic electrons either in the cme shock , in reconnection regions on current sheets behind the cme or trapped in a large loop with strong convergence , will be discussed in future papers .",
