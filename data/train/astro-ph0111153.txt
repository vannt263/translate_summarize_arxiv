    "cir x1 is a peculiar low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) . generally in lmxbs",
    "the companion star has a mass @xmath4 m@xmath5 and the orbit is almost circular ; contrarily cir x1 has a companion star of @xmath6 m@xmath5 ( probably a subgiant , see johnston et al . , 1999 ) , an orbital period of @xmath7 days and an eccentric orbit with @xmath8 ( murdin et al . , 1980 ; tauris et al . , 1999",
    "it is a widely accepted idea that cir x1 is a runaway binary , because of its association with the supernova remnant g321.9 - 0.3 ( clark et al . , 1975 ) .",
    "the most recent estimation of the distance to the supernova remnant g321.9 - 0.3 , and hence to cir x1 , is 5.5 kpc ( case & bhattacharya , 1998 ) .",
    "therefore in the following we adopt 5.5 kpc as the distance to the source .",
    "the spectral and fast - timing properties of accreting low magnetic field neutron stars permit distinguishing them into two classes , z and atoll sources , using the pattern each source describes in an x - ray color - color diagram ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "the z sources are very bright and could have a moderate magnetic field , while the atoll sources have a lower luminosity and probably a weaker magnetic field .",
    "the timing analysis of rxte data ( shirey et al . , 1996 ) evidenced that cir x1 is more similar to lmxbs of the z class . however no quasi periodic oscillations at kilohertz frequencies were observed in cir x1 ( shirey , 1996 ) contrarily to all the other z - sources .",
    "brandt et al . ( 1996 ) , using asca / gis data taken on 1994 august 45 , found a sudden variation ( with a timescale of @xmath9 minutes ) of the flux at the periastron phase , where the count rate increased from @xmath10 counts s@xmath11 to @xmath12 counts s@xmath11 . in the low - count rate state they obtained a good fit to the 0.610 kev spectrum using a partial covering component , in addition to a two - blackbody model , with a corresponding hydrogen column of @xmath13 @xmath14 ; in the high - count rate state the partial covering of the x - ray spectrum was not needed .",
    "because of the similarity with the spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies with compton - thin tori , brandt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggested that matter at the outer edge of the accretion disk , together with an edge - on disc orientation , could explain the partial covering of the spectrum in cir x1 .",
    "iaria et al .",
    "( 2001a ) , using bepposax data , analysed the 0.1100 kev spectrum of cir x1 at orbital phases near the periastron .",
    "they found that the continuum could be well described by either a two - blackbody model or a comptonization model . in the first case , the so - called `` eastern model '' proposed by mitsuda et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , the soft blackbody emission is interpreted as the emission from the inner region of the accretion disk while the hard blackbody comes from the neutron star surface . in the case of cir x1",
    "the radius of the soft blackbody was @xmath15 km , which should correspond to the inner radius of the accretion disk , while the radius of the harder blackbody component was @xmath10 km , that is too large to be interpreted as the neutron star radius .",
    "therefore the comptonization model was preferred . a hard power - law tail , dominanting the spectrum at energies higher than 15 kev ,",
    "was also observed .",
    "a similar feature was observed in other z - source lmxbs ( gx 17 + 2 , di salvo et al . , 2000 ;",
    "gx 349 + 2 , di salvo et al . , 2001 ;",
    "gx 51 , asai et al . , 1994 ; sco x1 , damico et al . , 2000 )",
    ", suggesting that cir x1 shows a behaviour similar to that of other z - sources . finally a strong absorption edge at @xmath16 kev , produced by highly ionized iron , was needed to fit the spectrum of cir x1 .",
    "brandt & schulz ( 2000 ) , using chandra data , observed cir x1 near the periastron .",
    "they found , for the first time in the x - ray band , p - cygni profiles of lines emitted by highly ionized matter .",
    "the outflow velocity necessary to explain the p - cygni profiles was @xmath17 km / s . under the hypothesis that the source is seen nearly edge - on , they supposed that the model of a thermally driven wind ( begelman et al . , 1983 )",
    "could explain this outflow of ionized matter from the system .",
    "also they suggested that the absorption edge observed by iaria et al .",
    "( 2001a ) could be connected to the outflow .",
    "iaria et al .",
    "( 2001b ) , using asca data , studied the energy spectrum of cir x1 along its orbit .",
    "they distinguished three different x - ray states of the source as a function of its orbital phase . at first , when the source is near the periastron ( according to the ephemeris of stewart et al . , 1991 ) , the luminosity is super - eddington and a large x - ray flaring activity is present . in the second state , corresponding to the orbital phase interval @xmath18 , the luminosity is sub - eddington and the lightcurve does not show flaring activity . in the third state , in the orbital phase interval",
    "@xmath19 , an excess of neutral matter ( probably the atmosphere of the companion star and/or the accreting matter ) partially covers the emitting region . in all these states ,",
    "the continuum was well fitted using a comptonization model . unfortunately , because of the relatively narrow band of asca ( 0.610 kev ) , the spectral evolution of the hard tail along the orbit could not be studied . on the other hand , it was possible to study the evolution of the absorption edge along the orbit of cir x1 .",
    "at the phase of the flaring activity the hydrogen column derived from the edge was @xmath20 @xmath14 ; when the source moved away from the periastron the hydrogen column decreased ; the absorption edge ( from ionized iron ) was no longer detected at orbital phases from 0.78 to the periastron .",
    "it is possible that the outflowing wind is connected to the huge flaring activity at the periastron .    in this work",
    "we present the broad band ( 1.8100 kev ) spectrum of cir x1 from a bepposax observation taken at orbital phases 0.610.63 .",
    "the broad band allows us to constrain the continuum components of the spectrum and to detect the presence of a hard tail at energies higher than 20 kev .",
    "a pointed observation of cir x1 was carried out between 1999 feb 07 03:15:19 ut and 1999 feb 08 19:25:33 ut , with the narrow field instruments , nfis , on board bepposax ( boella et al . 1997 ) .",
    "these consist of four co - aligned instruments covering the 0.1200  kev energy range : a low - energy concentration spectrometer ( lecs ; operating in the range 0.110  kev ) , two medium - energy concentration spectrometers ( mecs ; 1.310  kev ) , a high - pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( hpgspc ; 760  kev ) , and a phoswich detector system ( pds ; 13200  kev ) .",
    "the lecs and the hpgspc were not active during this observation .",
    "the effective exposure time was 25  ks in the mecs and 11  ks in the pds . in the mecs image , data were extracted from a circular region of @xmath21 radius centered on the source centroid .",
    "data extracted from the same detector region during blank field observations were used for background subtraction .",
    "background subtraction for the pds data was obtained from data accumulated during off - source intervals .",
    "we rebinned the energy spectra in order to have at least 25 counts / channel and to oversample the instrument resolution with the same number of channels at all energies .",
    "using the orbital parameters reported by stewart et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , we have calculated that this observation corresponds to the orbital phase interval 0.610.63 , just after the apoastron . in figure 1",
    "we plotted the hardness - intensity diagram , where the hardness is the ratio between the count rate in the 37 kev energy band to the count rate in the 13 kev energy band , and the intensity is the count rate in the 17 kev energy band . in this figure",
    "we show both the data of this observation and those of a previous bepposax observation at the periastron ( see iaria et al . , 2001a ) . the data at the apoastron show larger hardness and lower intensity with respect to the data at the periastron .",
    "in figure 2 we plotted the color - color diagram of cir x1 data , where the hard color is the ratio between the count rate in the energy band 710 kev to that in the energy band 37 kev and the soft color is the hardness defined above .",
    "the data at the apoastron are at the top right in this figure while the data obtained at the periastron are at the bottom left , implying that the spectrum at the apoastron is harder in both the soft and hard color . in figure 3",
    "we plotted the lightcurve of the data at the apoastron in the energy band 1.810 kev ( upper panel ) together with the soft color as a function of time ( lower panel ) .",
    "the count rate smoothly decreases from @xmath12 counts s@xmath11 , at the beginning of the observation , to @xmath22 counts s@xmath11 , at the end of the observation .",
    "no flaring activity is present .",
    "because no significant spectral variation is observed in the hardness ratios described above , we produced an unique spectrum , in the band 1.8200 kev , from this observation .",
    "a systematic error of 1% was added to each spectrum . as customary , in the spectral fitting procedure we allowed for a different normalization of the pds spectrum relative to the mecs spectrum , always checking that derived values are in the standard range for that instrument .",
    "the energy ranges used for the spectral analysis are 1.810 kev for the mecs and 15200 kev for the pds . because of the lack of low energy data we fixed the value of the average photoelectric absorption by cold matter at @xmath23 @xmath14 ( see e.g. iaria et al .",
    "2001a , 2001b ) .",
    "we started fitting the data to the comptonization model _",
    "( titarchuk , 1994 ) .",
    "this model gave an unacceptable fit with @xmath24 ; the residuals with respect to this model are shown in figure 4 ( upper panel ) . from the residuals , it is evident that there is a feature between 8 and 10 kev and an excess at energies higher than 15 kev .",
    "note that because this simple model does not fit the high energy part of the spectrum , we had to fix the pds normalization factor to 0.85 ( its typical value ) to avoid unreasonably high values of this parameter .",
    "then , in agreement with the model proposed by iaria et al .",
    "( 2001a ) for the spectrum of cir x1 at the periastron , we added a power law to fit the high energy excess , an absorption edge at @xmath25 kev and a gaussian emission line at @xmath26 kev ( with the gaussian @xmath27 fixed at 0.25 kev ) , keeping fixed the pds normalization factor .",
    "the addition of each of these components is statistically significant and in this way the fit improves significantly , giving @xmath28 . in table 1 ( model 1 )",
    "we present the best fit parameters obtained for this model . looking at the residuals with respect to model 1 ( figure 4 , middle panel ) , we still see modulations between 1.8 and 5 kev and between 20 and 40 kev , indicating that the continuum emission could be more complex .",
    "the modulation in the residuals could be due to the large contribution at low energies of the power law which has a large normalization and a photon index of @xmath29 .",
    "we modified the power law multiplying it for an exponential cutoff at low energy ( _ expfac _ in xspec ) , fixing the low - energy cutoff at the electron temperature of the comptonized component .",
    "in this way we found a stable ( and reasonable ) fit , with the pds normalization factor and the width of the gaussian emission line as free parameters ( see table 1 , model 2 ) . the residuals ( see fig .",
    "4 , lower panel ) show that the modulation between 1.8 and 5 kev is now smaller .",
    "we obtain @xmath30 and an f - test with respect to the previous model gives a probability of chance improvement of the fit of @xmath31 .",
    "however , the modulation between 20 and 40 kev is still visible .",
    "we , therefore , tried an alternative model , consisting of model 1 to which we added a blackbody component at low energies .",
    "the addition of the blackbody component improved the fit significantly , giving @xmath32 , with a probability of chance improvement with respect to model 1 of @xmath33 .",
    "hence we consider this as the best fit model .",
    "the f - test for the addition of the power law component in this case gives a probability of chance improvement of @xmath34 . in table 1",
    "( model 3 ) we report the parameters of the best fit model . the blackbody temperature is @xmath35 kev",
    ". the parameters of the comptonized component are as follows : the seed - photon temperature is @xmath36 kev , the electron temperature is @xmath37 kev and the optical depth of the comptonizing cloud is @xmath38 .",
    "the centroid of the gaussian emission line is at @xmath39 kev , with fwhm@xmath40 kev , and the absorption edge is at @xmath41 kev , with an optical depth @xmath42 .",
    "the pds normalization factor is @xmath43 .    in figure 5",
    "we show the data and the residuals with respect to the model 3 .",
    "note that in this case the modulations between 1.8 and 5 kev and between 20 and 40 kev disappear , confirming that model 3 gives the best fit to these data . in figure 6",
    "we show the corresponding unfolded spectrum .",
    "the extrapolated unabsorbed flux , in the energy band 0.1200 kev , is @xmath44 erg s@xmath11 @xmath14 for the comptonized component , @xmath45 erg s@xmath11 @xmath14 for the blackbody component and @xmath46 erg s@xmath11 @xmath14 for the power - law component .",
    "we analyzed data of cir x1 from a bepposax observation ( in the orbital phase range 0.610.63 ) in the energy range 1.8200 kev .",
    "the lightcurve and the hardness ratio do not show large variations during the observation . from figures 1 and 2",
    "it is clear that the spectrum , in the range 110 kev , is different from that observed at the periastron ( iaria et al . , 2001a ) ; in fact the spectrum at the apoastron is harder in both the soft and hard colors and the intensity is lower than that at the periastron .",
    "the spectrum of cir x1 during this observation is very similar to that of other z - sources ( see di salvo et al . , 2000 ; di salvo et al . ,",
    "the soft x - ray continuum in the energy range 1.810 kev is well fitted by a blackbody and a comptonized component , while a power - law component , with photon index @xmath47 , is present at energies higher than 20 kev .",
    "the blackbody temperature is @xmath0 kev and the corresponding radius of the emitting region is @xmath48 km .",
    "this radius is too large to be associated with the emission from the neutron star surface ; therefore the blackbody component is probably emitted by the inner part of the accretion disk .",
    "the seed - photon and electron temperature of the comptonized component are @xmath1 kev and @xmath2 kev , respectively , and the optical depth is @xmath49 .",
    "we calculated the radius , @xmath50 , of the seed - photon emitting region using the parameters reported in table 1 ( model 3 ) following in t zand et _ al . _",
    "( 1999 ) ; we obtain @xmath51 km .",
    "this component could be produced by a corona surrounding the neutron star and occulting the inner region of the accretion disk .",
    "we found an absorption edge at @xmath52 kev with @xmath53 .",
    "the energy of the absorption edge is compatible with iron ionization levels of fe xxiii  xxiv ( see turner et _ al .",
    "_ , 1992 for a correspondence between iron edge energy and ionization level ) . the best fit value for the optical depth @xmath54 , considering the photoionization cross section for the k - shell of fe xxiii ( krolik & kallman , 1987 ) , corresponds to a hydrogen column density of @xmath55 @xmath14 . a gaussian emission line is also detected at @xmath39 kev .",
    "the energy of the emission line corresponds to iron ionization levels fe xxiv  xxv , compatible with that of the absorption edge ( see turner et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "this suggests that the iron emission line could be produced in the same region where the absorption edge is produced .",
    "note that the asca spectrum at orbital phase 0.540.56 , the nearest to the orbital phase of the bepposax observation analyzed here , shows both the iron emission line and the absorption edge , and their parameters are in agreement with the values we found from this bepposax observation ( cf .",
    "iaria et al .",
    "2001b ) .",
    "the best fit model obtained here is different from that used by iaria et al .",
    "( 2001a ) for the bepposax spectrum of cir x1 taken at the periastron , when a flaring activity was present . in that case",
    "only the comptonized component was needed to fit the continuum from 0.12 to 10 kev and the blackbody component was not needed .",
    "the seed - photon and electron temperatures at the periastron were @xmath56 and @xmath43 kev , respectively , with a radius of the seed - photon emitting region of @xmath57 km .",
    "one possibility to explain the large seed - photon radius observed at the periastron , in the hypothesis it is the inner radius of the accretion disk , might be the presence of a large neutron star magnetic field with a strength of @xmath58 g , more the one order of magnitude higher than the typical value estimated for the z - sources . in light of the new results on cir x1 , presented in this work , we can exclude this possibility .",
    "in fact , the flux from the source was larger than @xmath59 erg @xmath14 s@xmath11 during the observation at the periastron and , for a distance to the source of 5.5 kpc ( case & bhattacharya , 1998 ) , the corresponding luminosity is super - eddington . during the observation analysed here , where cir x1 is near the apoastron , the estimated flux is @xmath60 erg @xmath14 s@xmath11 and the luminosity is sub - eddington . because the x - ray luminosity is connected to the accretion rate , the ram pressure of the disk should be lower , by a factor of @xmath61 at the apoastron than at the periastron . consequently the magnetospheric radius",
    "( see e.g. burderi et al . , 1998 )",
    "should be @xmath62 km at the apoastron , assuming the same strength of the magnetic field of @xmath58 g. however we find that the inner radius of the accretion disk is @xmath48 km .",
    "another possibility to explain the large inner radius of the accretion disk observed at the periastron can be the occultation of the inner region by a corona surrounding the neutron star .",
    "this corona should be therefore more extended at the periastron and cover a larger part of the accretion disk .",
    "this hypothesis is also supported by the differences between the spectrum at the periastron and at the apoastron .",
    "the seed - photon temperature is much lower at the periastron ( @xmath56 kev ) , with a comparatively higher accretion rate , than at the apoastron ( @xmath1 kev ) , implying that at the periastron the seed photons for the comptonization come from a further region in the accretion disk .",
    "in particular at the periastron the seed photons probably come from a region which extends up to a radius of @xmath15 km in the accretion disk ( see iaria et al .",
    "2001a ) . on the other hand at the apoastron",
    ", the seed photons probably come from a region which extends up to @xmath9 km in the accretion disk .",
    "this also explains why we observe a blackbody component at the apoastron , which we interpret as the emission of the part of the accretion disk not covered by the corona , i.e.  from radii larger than @xmath63 km , while this component is not observed at the periastron .",
    "in fact the disk emission from radii larger than 150 km would probably be too soft to be significantly detected by the bepposax / lecs .    a power - law component , dominanting the spectrum of cir x1 at energies higher than 20 kev , is also detected with high statistical significance .",
    "this component was observed two times in cir x1 : at the periastron ( iaria et al . , 2001a ) , and near the apoastron ( present work ) . at the periastron of cir x1",
    "the photon index was @xmath29 with a flux in the band 10200 kev of @xmath64 erg s@xmath11 @xmath14 . at the apoastron",
    "the photon - index is @xmath65 with a flux in the band 10200 kev of @xmath66 erg s@xmath11 @xmath14 .",
    "note that the radio emission in cir x1 is maximum near the periastron ( stewart et al .",
    ", 1993 ; fender , 1997 ) . also , the observation of cir x1 presented in this work is at the orbital phase between 0.610.63 ; at the same orbital phases fender ( 1997 ) detected a secondary radio flaring activity with a maximum intensity of @xmath67 mjy , lower than at the periastron ( where the maximum intensity is @xmath68 mjy ) .",
    "although a systematic study of the presence of the hard power - law component along the entire orbit is needed to draw a conclusion , the coincidence between the presence of this component and periods of radio flares suggests a connection between these two phenomena .",
    "in particular the power - law component might have a non - thermal origin and might be related to the presence of the high velocity electrons responsible for the radio emission .    as mentioned above",
    ", there is evidence that a jet is present at the periastron ( stewart et al . , 1993 ; fender , 1997 ) . also , the prominent absorption edge from highly ionized matter observed at the periastron of cir x1 is probably connected with the outflowing wind observed by chandra ( brandt & schulz , 2000 ; iaria et al . , 2001b ) .",
    "these observations could be explained using a model similar to that proposed for young stellar objects ( ysos ) . the source hh30 presents both a jet and a wind from the disk .",
    "goodson et al . ( 1999 ) explain the presence of these two phenomenaby postulating that the interaction between the stellar magnetosphere and the surrounding accretion disk drives a two - component outflow , the jet and the disk wind .",
    "the magnetic loops connecting the accretion disk to the star , expand due to the differential rotation between the star and the disk ( hayashi at al .",
    ", 1996 ; lovelace et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the plasma trapped in the loops is driven toward the rotation axis , giving a collimated jet and an outflowing wind outward along the disk surface .",
    "magnetic reconnections can produce large x - ray flaring activity and allow for the process to repeat .",
    "in this interpretation the p - cygni profiles and the absorption edge observed near the periastron could be explained by the disk wind expected in this model , the radio emission by the collimated jet and the flaring activity at the periastron by the magnetic reconnections .",
    "the comptonized emission observed at the periastron could also come from the outflowing wind .",
    "the outflow and then the comptonizing region , because of the large magnetic activity , probably extends far from the neutron star above the disk , and , as mentioned above , this might explain why we do not observe the blackbody emission from the accretion disk at the periastron .",
    "however , note that the work of goodson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) is based on ysos and possibly the results might not be applied in a straightforward way to the case of cir x1 , because of the different strength of the neutron star magnetic field .",
    "a study of the consequences of this model in the more extreme case of magnetized neutron stars would be interesting in this context .",
    "following this scenario we can suppose that at the apoastron there are no magnetic reconnections and consequently the source is not highly variable .",
    "however , the reason for this difference between the periastron and the apoastron is not clear , although we can suppose it can be related to the difference in the accretion rate and/or tidal interactions , and should be investigated with a proper model .",
    "in this work we presented the analysis of the broad band ( 1.8200 kev ) spectrum of cir x1 at the orbital phase 0.610.63 , using a bepposax observation .",
    "the luminosity of the source is sub - eddington , and the spectrum is harder than that at the periastron ( iaria et al . , 2001a ) .",
    "the model used to fit this spectrum is the same that has been used for other z - sources ( see di salvo et al . , 2000 ; di salvo et al . , 2001 ) ; we find that the continuum is well fitted using three components .",
    "the first is a blackbody with a temperature of @xmath0 kev , probably produced by the inner region of the accretion disk .",
    "the corresponding blackbody radius is @xmath48 km .",
    "the second is a comptonized component with a seed - photon temperature of @xmath1 kev , an electron temperature of @xmath2 kev and optical depth of @xmath3 .",
    "we interpret this component as the emission from a corona ( or an outflowing wind ) around the neutron star . in this case",
    "there is a weaker outflow of matter , suggested by the relatively low optical depth of the absorption edge , which is now @xmath69 , one order of magnitude lower than at the periastron .",
    "the third component is a power - law that could be produced by comptonization off non - thermal electrons or by synchrotron emission in a jet .",
    "an emission line is also present at @xmath39 kev , with @xmath70 kev .",
    "the ionization level inferred from the line is fe xxiv  xxv .",
    "the last observed feature is an absorption edge from highly ionized iron ( fe xxiii  xxiv ) , probably produced by an outflowing wind along the disk surface .",
