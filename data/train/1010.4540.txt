    "there is a considerable theoretical and practical interest in the dynamics of systems of interacting particles in confined geometries @xcite .",
    "single - file diffusion ( sfd ) refers to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) process where the motion of particles in a narrow channel ( e.g. , _",
    "quasi_-1d systems ) is limited such that particles are not able to cross each other . as a consequence ,",
    "the system diffuses as a whole resulting in anomalous diffusion .",
    "the mechanism of sfd was first proposed by hodgkin and keynes @xcite in order to study the passage of molecules through narrow pores . since the order of the particles",
    "is conserved over time , this results in unusual dynamics of the system @xcite , different from what is predicted from diffusion governed by fick s law .",
    "the main characteristic of the sfd phenomena is that , in the long - time limit , the msd ( mean - square displacement , defined as @xmath3^{2 } \\rangle_{\\delta t}$ ] ) scales with time as @xmath4 this relation was first obtained analytically in the pioneering work of harris @xcite .",
    "recent advances in nanotechnology have stimulated a growing interest in sfd , in particular , in the study of transport in nanopores @xcite .",
    "ion channels of biological membranes and carbon nanotubes @xcite are examples of such nanopores .",
    "the macroscopic flux of particles through such nanopores is of great importance for many practical applications , e.g. , particle transport across membranes is a crucial intermediate step in almost all biological and chemical engineering processes .",
    "sfd was observed in experiments on diffusion of molecules in zeolite molecular sieves @xcite .",
    "zeolites with unconnected parallel channels may serve as a good realization of the theoretically investigated one - dimensional systems .",
    "sfd is also related to growth phenomena @xcite .",
    "the theoretical background of sfd was developed in early studies on transport phenomena in 1d channels @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to learn how the size of the system will influence the diffusive properties of the system .",
    "sfd in finite size systems has been the focus of increasing attention since there are few exact theoretical results to date @xcite , which showed the existence of different regimes of diffusion .",
    "colloidal systems , complex plasmas and vortex matter in type - ii superconductors are examples of systems where sfd may occur .",
    "the use of colloidal particles is technically interesting since it allows real time and spatial direct observation of their position , which is a great advantage as compared to atoms or molecules , as shown recently in , e.g. , the experimental study of defect induced melting @xcite .",
    "one typically uses micro - meter size colloidal particles in narrow channels , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the paramagnetic colloidal spheres of 3.6 @xmath5 were confined in circular trenches fabricated by photolithography and their trajectories were followed over long periods of time .",
    "several other studies have focused on the diffusive properties of complex plasmas .",
    "a complex plasma consists of micrometer - sized ( `` dust '' ) particles immersed in a gaseous plasma background .",
    "dust particles typically acquire a negative charge of several thousand elementary charges , and thus they interact with each other through their strong electrostatic repulsion @xcite",
    ".    systems of particles moving in space of reduced dimensionality or submitted to an external confinement potential exhibit different behavior from their free - of - border counterparts @xcite . the combined effect of interaction between the particles and the confinement potential plays a crucial role in their physical and chemical properties @xcite .",
    "@xcite , it was found that sfd depends on the inter - particle interaction and can even be suppressed if the interaction is sufficiently strong , resulting in a slower subdiffusive behavior , where @xmath1 @xmath2 , with @xmath6 .    in this paper , we will investigate the effects of confinement potential on the diffusive properties of a q1d system of interacting particles . in the limiting case of very narrow ( wide ) channels , particle diffusion can be referred to sfd ( 2d regime ) characterized by a subdiffusive ( normal diffusive ) long - time regime where the mean - squared displacement ( msd ) @xmath1 @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) . recall that the msd of a tagged hard - sphere particle in a one dimensional infinite system is characterized by two limiting diffusion behaviors : for time scales shorter than a certain crossover time @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath11 is the particle concentration , @xmath1 @xmath8 which is referred to as the normal diffusion regime @xcite . for times larger than @xmath12 , the system exhibits a subdiffusive behavior , with the msd @xmath1 @xmath7 , which characterizes the single - file diffusion regime .",
    "between these two regimes , there is a transient regime exhibiting a non - trivial functional form .",
    "however , in case of a _ finite _ system of diffusing particles ( e.g. , a circular chain or a straight chain in the presence of periodic boundary conditions ) , the sfd regime ( i.e. , with @xmath1 @xmath7 ) does not hold for @xmath13 , unlike in an infinite system .",
    "instead , for sufficiently long times , the sfd regime turns to the regime of _ collective _ diffusion , i.e. , when the whole system diffuses as a single `` particle '' with a renormalized mass . this diffusive behavior has been revealed in experiments @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "this collective diffusion regime is similar to the initial short - time diffusion regime and it is characterized by either @xmath1 @xmath8 , for overdamped particles ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) or by @xmath1 @xmath14 ( followed by the msd @xmath8 ) , for underdamped systems @xcite . correspondingly , the time interval where the sfd regime is observed becomes _ finite _ in finite size systems .",
    "it depends on the lenght of the chain of diffusing particles : the longer the chain the longer the sfd time interval . therefore , in order to observe a clear power - law behavior ( i.e. , @xmath1 @xmath2 ) one should consider sufficiently large systems .",
    "here we focus on this intermediate diffusion regime and we show that it can be characterized by @xmath1 @xmath2 , where @xmath15 , depending on the width ( or the strenght of the confinement potential ) of the channel .",
    "we analyze the msd for two different channel geometries : ( i ) a linear channel , and ( ii ) a circular channel .",
    "these two systems correspond to different experimental realizations of diffusion of charged particles in narrow channels @xcite .",
    "the latter one ( i.e. , a circular channel ) has obvious advantages : ( i ) it allows a long - time observation of diffusion using a relatively short circuit , and ( ii ) it provides constant average particle density and absence of density gradients ( which occur in , e.g. , a linear channel due to the entry / exit of particles in / from the channel ) .",
    "thus circular narrow channels were used in diffusion experiments with colloids @xcite and metallic charged particles ( balls ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , using different systems allows us to demonstrate that the results obtained in our study are generic and do not depend on the specific experimental set - up .",

    "iv , we discuss the possibility of experimental observation of the studied crossover from the sfd to 2d diffusive regime . for that purpose ,",

    "the values of @xmath0 presented in these figures correspond to the minimum of the effective time dependent exponent @xmath90 .",

    "the @xmath0-dependence on both the confinement parameters ( i.e. , @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) presents a different qualitative behavior , namely , the sfd regime is reached after a smoother crossover in the parabolic confinement case as compared to the hardwall case .",
    "a similar smoother crossover is also found in the case of a circular channel with parabolic confinement in the radial direction .",
    "a more detailed discussion on these two different types of the behavior of @xmath0 will be provided in sec .",
    "[ circularchannel ] .      for small values of the parabolic confinement ( e.g. , @xmath96 ) , the msd curves present three different diffusive regimes : ( i ) a short - time normal diffusion regime , where msd @xmath1 @xmath8 ; ( ii ) a subdiffusive regime with @xmath1 @xmath2 , where @xmath15 and ( iii ) a `` long - time '' diffusion regime , which is characterized by @xmath1 @xmath8 .",
    "note that the `` long - time '' term used here is not to be confused with the long - time used for _ infinite _ systems , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "however , for large values of the parabolic confinement ( e.g. , @xmath87 ) , we observe only two distinct diffusive regimes , namely : ( i ) a short - time normal diffusion regime ( @xmath1 @xmath8 ) and ( ii ) a sfd regime ( i.e. , @xmath1 @xmath7 ) .",
    "one question that arises naturally is whether this normal diffusion regime ( i.e. , @xmath1 @xmath8 for `` long - times '' ) is an effect of the _ colletive _ motion of the system ( center - of - mass motion ) or an effect of the single - particle jumping process , since the confinement potential @xmath96 allows particles bypass . in order to answer this question",
    ", we calculate the number of crossing events @xmath95 as a function of time and results are shown in fig .",
    "[ ncross](a ) .",
    "we found that for small values of the confinement potential ( e.g. , @xmath96 ) the number of crossing events grows linearly in time , i.e. , @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the rate of crossing events . on the other hand ,",
    "a strong confinement potential ( e.g. , @xmath87 ) prevents particles from bypassing , and thus @xmath99 during the whole simulation time .",
    "therefore , the `` long - time '' normal diffusive behavior ( i.e. , @xmath1 @xmath8 for `` long - times '' ) found in our simulations for the case where the sf ( single - file ) condition is broken ( e.g. , @xmath96 ) is _ not _ due to a collective ( center - of - mass ) diffusion . instead , this normal diffusive behaviour is due to a single - particle jumping process , which happens with a constant rate @xmath100 for the case of small values of the confinement ( @xmath96 ) and @xmath101 ( for @xmath87 ) .",
    "the same analysis was done for the case of the hard - wall confinement potential , and the results are found to be the same as for the parabolic confinement .",
    "nevertheless , we point out that the collective diffusion does indeed exist , but our results from simulations do not allow us to observe this collective ( center - of - mass ) diffusion regime because of the large size of our chain of particles ( @xmath102 ) . simulations with @xmath103 , and excluding the possibility of mutual bypass ( strong confinement potential ) , allowed us to observe that the @xmath1 @xmath8 regime is recovered in the `` long - time '' limit . in sec .",
    "v , we will further discuss the long - time limit using a model of discrete sites .",
    "as we demonstrated above , the transition from pure 1d diffusion ( sfd ) characterized by @xmath92 to a quasi-1d behavior ( with @xmath104 ) could be either more `` smooth '' ( as in fig .",
    "1(d ) , for a parabolic confinement ) or more `` abrupt '' ( as in fig .",
    "2(d ) , for a hard - wall confinement ) .",
    "one can intuitively expect that this difference in behavior can manifest itself also in the crossing events rate @xmath98 , i.e. , that @xmath98 as a function of @xmath84 ( or @xmath105 ) should display a clear signature of either `` smooth '' or `` abrupt '' behavior .    however , the link between the two quantities , i.e. , the exponent , @xmath106 , and the crossing events rate , @xmath107 is not that straightforward . to understand this ,",
    "let us refer to the long - time limit ( which will be addressed in detail within the discrete - site model in sec .",
    "as we show , in the long - time limit the exponent @xmath0 is defined by one of the two conditions : @xmath101 ( then @xmath92 ) or @xmath100 ( then @xmath108 ) and it does _ not _ depend on the specific value of @xmath98 provided it is nonzero .",
    "therefore , in the long - time limit the transition between 1d to 2d behavior _ is not sensitive _ to the particular behavior of the function @xmath107 .",
    "although for `` intermediate '' times ( considered in this section ) the condition @xmath101 _ or _ @xmath109 is not critical , nevertheless , very small change in the crossing events rate @xmath107 strongly influences the behavior of the exponent @xmath106 .",

    "in the previous section , we analyzed the transition ( crossover ) from the sfd regime to 2d diffusion in narrow channels of increasing width .",
    "the analysis was performed for a straight channel with either hard - wall or parabolic confinement potential . however , in terms of possible experimental verification of the studied effect , one faces an obvious limitation of this model : although easy in simulation , it is hard to experimentally fulfill the periodic boundary conditions at the ends of an _ open _ channel .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid this difficulty , in sfd experiments @xcite circular channels were used .    in this section ,",
    "we investigate the transition ( crossover ) from sfd to 2d - diffusion in a system of interacting particles diffusing in a channel of _ circular _ shape .",
    "in particular , we will study the influence of the strength of the confinement ( i.e. , the depth of the potential profile across the channel ) on the diffusive behavior . without loss of generality , we will adhere to the specific conditions and parameters of the experimental set - up used in ref .",
    "an additional advantage of this model is that the motion of the system of charged metallic balls @xcite is _ not _ overdamped , and we will solve the full langevin equations of motion to study the diffusive behavior of the system .",

    "it should be noted that in this case , @xmath128 is approximately equal to @xmath129 due to the weak yukawa interaction , which slightly shifts the particles away from the bottom of the channel .",
    "such a choice of @xmath128 is related to the fact that we study the influence of the confinement on the diffusion and , therefore , the potential energy of the particles must be of the order of the inter - particle interaction energy .",

    "increase in @xmath132 corresponds to a decrease in the depth of the confinement ( [ vc ] ) which leads to the expansion of the area of radial localization of particles .",
    "therefore , an increase of @xmath132 results in a similar effect ( i.e. , spatial delocalization of particles ) as an increase of temperature , i.e. , parameter @xmath132 can be considered as an `` effective temperature '' .",
