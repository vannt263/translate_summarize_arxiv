    "tilings of @xmath0 , and the tiling spaces associated with them , play a fundamental role in recent investigations in number theory , physics , logic , computer science , and dynamical systems . for a given tiling @xmath4 of @xmath0",
    ", one would like to understand the recurrence properties of the various patterns made by the tiles of @xmath4 .",
    "these properties are encoded in the topology of the tiling space @xmath5 associated with @xmath4 and in the dynamics of the action of @xmath0 by translation on @xmath5 . under standard assumptions on the nature of @xmath4 ,",
    "the space @xmath5 is locally homeomorphic with a product of a @xmath3-dimensional disk and a cantor set , the arc - components of @xmath5 coincide with the orbits of the @xmath0-action , and recurrences of patterns in a tiling correspond to returns under the @xmath0-action to local neighborhoods .",
    "we are interested here in the _ asymptotics _ of the translation action on tiling spaces .",
    "we will put sufficient conditions on the tilings we consider so that the associated tiling spaces are compact metric spaces : under the metric , @xmath3 , two tilings are close if a small translate of one agrees with the other in a large neighborhood of the origin .",
    "tilings @xmath6 are then asymptotic in direction @xmath7 if @xmath8 as @xmath9 .",
    "we prove under rather general hypotheses that there are @xmath10 that are asymptotic in an entire open hemisphere s worth of directions .",
    "to say more , we must restrict a bit .",
    "there are three common procedures for constructing tilings of @xmath0 : cut - and - project ; matching rules ; and substitutions . with the cut - and - project method",
    ", the asymptotic tilings and directions can be immediately deduced from the geometry of the boundary of the defining window ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "global properties of matching rule tilings are , on the other hand , very difficult to ascertain - unless the rules enforce the sort of hierarchical structure enjoyed by substitution tilings ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we are thus led to consider substitutions @xmath11 and their associated tiling spaces @xmath12 .",
    "a substitution @xmath11 induces a self - map , also denoted by @xmath11 , of @xmath12 .",
    "this will , among other things , provide a way of pinning down a specific location for the start of asymptoticity .",
    "for example , in the one - dimensional ( @xmath13 ) case , there are a finite and non - zero number of asymptotic @xmath14-orbits ( at most @xmath15 if there are @xmath16 distinct tiles - see @xcite ) .",
    "each of these orbits contains a unique tiling that is periodic under @xmath11 and we may reasonably designate these @xmath11-periodic , @xmath14-asymptotic , orbits as the exact locations on their arc - components where asymptoticity starts .",
    "let us say this more precisely . if @xmath10 are such that @xmath17 as @xmath9 ( or as @xmath18 ) , then there is a unique @xmath19 so that , if @xmath20 and @xmath21 , then @xmath22 and @xmath23 are @xmath11-periodic .",
    "moreover , @xmath24 and @xmath25 for all @xmath26 ( resp . , @xmath27 ) , where @xmath28 denotes the @xmath11-stable ` manifold ' .",
    "this choice for initial point of asymptoticity is made less arbitrary by the rigidity result of @xcite : if @xmath12 and @xmath29 are homeomorphic one - dimensional substitution tiling spaces , then there is a homeomorphism of @xmath12 with @xmath29 that not only conjugates the @xmath14-actions ( perhaps with rescaling ) , but also conjugates some power of @xmath11 with a power of @xmath30 and hence takes @xmath11-periodic orbits to @xmath30-periodic orbits .",
    "thus , the finite collection of _ asymptotic pairs _ @xmath31 , as above , is a topological invariant for @xmath12 .",
    "( a complete topological invariant for one - dimensional substitution tiling spaces is derived from asymptotic pairs in @xcite and their connection with the matsumoto @xmath32-group is explored in @xcite . )    in this article we extend the one - dimensional results to higher dimensional substitution tiling spaces .",
    "we will call a pair of tilings @xmath33 a _ branch pair _ if @xmath34 and there is an open hemisphere @xmath35 so that @xmath36 for all @xmath37 and all @xmath26 .",
    "we will see that such a pair is asymptotic in the directions @xmath38 .",
    "( the terminology ` branch pair ' is inspired by the fact that , if the tiles are polyhedral , then the space @xmath12 is obtained as an inverse limit of a map on a branched manifold .",
    "the asymptotic - in - a - half - space pairs are then a ghostly remnant of the branching in the approximating branched manifolds . )",
    "the general situation is quite complicated when @xmath39 .",
    "members of branch pairs are not necessarily periodic under the substitution and there are typically infinitely many branch pairs",
    ". however , there are at most finitely many branch pairs that are asymptotic in a set of directions that contains a given closed hemisphere in its interior , and they are all substitution - periodic ( proposition [ periodic branch pairs exist ] ) .",
    "to capture the asymptotic structure of a substitution tiling space , we define the _ branch locus _ ( essentially , this consists of all the members of branch pairs , together with all the tilings obtained by translating these members in directions in the boundary of their maximal asymptotic sectors , and all tilings accumulated on by such ) . we prove ( theorem [ topological invariance 1 ] ) that if a self - similar substitution tiling space has a branch pair whose set of asymptotic directions contains a closed hemisphere in its interior , then the branch locus is a topological invariant .",
    "if we restrict further to @xmath40-dimensional self - similar substitution tiling spaces , the structure of the branch locus becomes manageable : there are only finitely many lines along which branching occurs ( theorem [ finitely many sectors ] ) and if the substitution is also pisot , then the branch locus is the inverse limit of an expanding markov map on a compact @xmath41-dimensional simplicial complex . in the latter case",
    ", it follows from the rigidity result of kwapisz ( @xcite ) that the branch locus is also a topological invariant ( theorem [ topological invariance 2 ] ) .",
    "it frequently occurs that asymptotic structure in a tiling space can be held responsible for the appearance of certain subgroups in the cohomology of the space .",
    "for example , in the @xmath41-dimensional period doubling tiling space ( @xmath42 ) , there is a branch pair @xmath43 with @xmath17 as @xmath44 : this pair contributes a @xmath45 in @xmath46 .",
    "similarly , the branch locus of the @xmath40-dimensional half - hex tiling space ( see example 1 ) consists of three tilings , each asymptotic to the other two in all directions : this contributes @xmath47 to @xmath48 . for the chair tiling ( example 2 ) , there are two  tubes \" made each of @xmath49 orbits of four @xmath40-addic solenoids in the branch locus that contribute @xmath50 ^ 2 $ ] to @xmath48 ( the asymptotic structure also is responsible for a @xmath51 that , while it does nt show up in @xmath48 of the full tiling space , is , none - the - less , a topological invariant - see @xcite ) .",
    "calculations along these lines can be found in the dissertation , @xcite , of the second author , as can preliminary versions of many of the results contained in this article .",
    "the existence of tilings that are asymptotic in a hemisphere s worth of directions is closely related to lack of expansiveness of translation subdynamics . in @xcite , boyle and lind consider subdynamics of expansive @xmath52 actions on compact metric spaces .",
    "in particular , they show that ( for @xmath39 ) there is always a @xmath2-dimensional subspace of @xmath0 so that the restriction of the @xmath52 action to directions within a bounded distance of the subspace is not expansive .",
    "the corresponding notion of expansiveness for the translation action of @xmath0 on a @xmath3-dimensional tiling space @xmath5 would be : the action is _ transversely expansive _ provided there is an @xmath53 so that if @xmath10 are any two tilings that share a tile , then there is a @xmath54 with @xmath55 . under the assumption of finite local complexity ( see section [ sec : background ] ) , the translation action is transversely expansive . under additional ( very mild ) hypotheses ,",
    "proposition [ agree in half - space ] implies that there is always a @xmath2 dimensional subspace of @xmath0 restricted to which the translation action on @xmath5 is not transversely expansive . if @xmath56 and @xmath5 is a self - similar substitution tiling space , it is a consequence of theorem [ two sectors ] that there are at least two independent directions in which translation is not transversely expansive .",
    "in section [ sec : background ] we review basic definitions and facts about tiling spaces .",
    "section [ sec : definitions ] introduces the terminology related to asymptotic structures and establishes some general results . in section [ 2-d ]",
    "we restrict to the case of @xmath40-dimensional self - similar substitution tiling spaces .",
