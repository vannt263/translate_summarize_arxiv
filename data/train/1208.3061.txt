    "bilateral dyck paths are directed walks on @xmath2 starting at @xmath3 in the @xmath4-plane and ending on the line @xmath5 , which have steps in the @xmath6 ( up - step ) and @xmath7 ( down - step ) directions .",
    "let @xmath8 be the set of all bilateral dyck paths .",
    "note that in the literature these are also referred to as free dyck paths @xcite or grand - dyck paths @xcite .",
    "dyck paths are paths in @xmath8 which have no vertices with negative @xmath9-coordinates .",
    "let @xmath10 be the set of all dyck paths .",
    "we define a negative dyck path to be a bilateral dyck path of nonzero length which has no vertices with positive @xmath9-coordinates .",
    "given @xmath11 , we define the semilength @xmath12 to be half the number of its steps .",
    "we say that an up - step is at height @xmath13 if it starts at a vertex @xmath14 and ends at a vertex @xmath15 ; it is at odd height if and only if @xmath13 is odd .",
    "a down - step is at height @xmath13 if it starts at a vertex @xmath15 and ends at a vertex @xmath16 ; it is at odd height if and only if @xmath13 is odd .",
    "therefore the first and last steps in any dyck path are at height @xmath17 , and an up - step and its matching down - step have the same height .",
    "this definition is consistent with that in @xcite .",
    "we define a peak as an up - step followed immediately by a down - step , and the height of a peak as the height of the steps which form it , or equivalently as the height of the vertex common to both steps of the peak .",
    "we define a valley to be a down - step followed immediately by an up - step .",
    "we define a contact as a down - step at height @xmath17 or an up - step at height @xmath18 .",
    "we define a crossing to be either a down - step at height @xmath17 followed immediately by a down - step at height @xmath18 , or an up - step at height @xmath18 followed immediately by an up - step at height @xmath17 .",
    "we define a prime dyck path to be a dyck path with exactly one contact .",
    "let @xmath19 be the set of words with the symbol set @xmath20 . a bilateral dyck word of semilength @xmath21 is an element of @xmath19 such that the letters @xmath22 and @xmath23 each appear @xmath21 times . a dyck word of semilength @xmath21 is a bilateral dyck word such that no initial segment of the string has more @xmath23s than @xmath22s",
    "there is an obvious bijection between paths and words , mapping up - steps to @xmath22s and down - steps to @xmath23s , and we will use words and paths interchangeably in this paper .",
    "for example , we say that a dyck word is prime if it corresponds to a prime dyck path .",
    "it is an established fact that many patterns in dyck paths are enumerated by narayana numbers @xmath24 for example , there are @xmath25 dyck paths of semilength @xmath21 with precisely @xmath1 peaks , or @xmath1 up - steps at odd height , or @xmath26 up - steps at even height , and many other statistics @xcite",
    ". these are most easily proven by generating function techniques @xcite .",
    "equinumeracy then follows from showing that different counting problems have the same generating function .    in this note",
    "we give a direct bijection between dyck paths of semilength @xmath21 with @xmath1 up - steps at odd height and dyck paths of semilength @xmath21 with @xmath1 peaks .",
    "clearly such a bijection provides more structural insight than a proof using generating function techniques .    in @xcite",
    "a bijection between dyck paths of semilength @xmath21 with @xmath26 up - steps at even height and dyck paths of semilength @xmath21 with @xmath1 peaks is given , using the machinery of checkmark sequences . that bijection is given as a restriction of a bijection between bilateral dyck paths .",
    "to make a connection of our result with the work in @xcite , we remark that any dyck path with @xmath1 up - steps at odd height can be mapped bijectively to a dyck path with @xmath26 up - steps at even height as follows .",
    "if @xmath27 is a dyck path of nonzero length , the corresponding dyck word @xmath28 can be uniquely decomposed into a word of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are dyck words .",
    "exchanging @xmath30 and @xmath31 changes the parity of the steps of the sub - paths corresponding to @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and therefore the involution mapping @xmath29 to @xmath32 gives the desired bijection .",
    "we will define this more carefully in section [ extension ] .    by bijecting dyck paths of semilength @xmath21 with @xmath26 up - steps at even height to dyck paths with @xmath1 up - steps at odd height using the involution",
    "just described , followed by application of the map @xmath33 given in the theorem below , we also have a bijection of dyck paths of semilength @xmath21 with @xmath26 up - steps at even height to dyck paths of semilength @xmath21 with @xmath1 peaks .",
    "already from inspecting the five dyck paths of semilength @xmath34 one can see that this bijection is different from the one presented in @xcite .",
    "we note that the extension of the bijection in @xcite to bilateral dyck paths needs a slightly modified definition of peaks .",
    "more precisely , in @xcite an initial down - step or final up - step in a bilateral dyck path is also counted as a peak , and the bijection given is between bilateral dyck paths of semilength @xmath21 with @xmath26 up - steps at even height and bilateral dyck paths of semilength @xmath21 with @xmath1 ( modified ) peaks .",
    "in contrast , our bijection extends to a bijection between bilateral dyck paths of semilength @xmath21 with @xmath1 up - steps at odd height and bilateral dyck paths of semilength @xmath21 with @xmath1 peaks .",
    "note that the restriction of our bijection to dyck paths is essentially identical to a bijection given in @xcite .",
    "there , the authors used two length - preserving bijections on dyck paths to show the equidistribution of statistics of certain strings occurring at odd height , at even height , and anywhere .",
    "however , the problem discussed here , regarding the equidistribution of up - steps at odd height and peaks anywhere , was not addressed in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath27 is a dyck path of nonzero length with @xmath35 down steps at height @xmath36 before the first contact , the corresponding dyck word @xmath28 can be uniquely decomposed into a word of the form @xmath37 where each @xmath38 is a dyck word . using this decomposition",
    ", we define the map @xmath39 recursively by setting @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 denotes the empty word .    as the decomposition expresses a dyck word in terms of strictly smaller dyck words , the recursion terminates .",
    "therefore @xmath33 is well - defined on all dyck words .",
    "[ theorem1 ] @xmath33 gives an explicit bijection from the set of dyck paths of semilength @xmath21 with @xmath43 contacts and @xmath1 up - steps at odd height to the set of dyck paths of semilength @xmath21 with @xmath43 contacts and @xmath1 peaks .",
    "the decomposition implies that the parity of a step in the path corresponding to the sub - word @xmath38 is the same as its parity in the original path @xmath27 .",
    "as the first step of each sub - path corresponding to nonempty @xmath38 is at odd height , each recursive iteration either maps the empty word to itself or maps exactly one up - step at odd height ( the first step of the path @xmath27 ) to a peak .",
    "thus @xmath33 maps a path with @xmath1 up - steps at odd height to a path with @xmath1 peaks .",
    "clearly , @xmath33 does not change the number of contacts .",
    "we now show that @xmath33 is indeed a bijection by giving its inverse .",
    "if @xmath27 is a dyck path with right - most peak at height @xmath44 with @xmath45 , the corresponding dyck word @xmath28 can be uniquely decomposed into a word of the form @xmath46 where each @xmath38 is a dyck word .",
    "let @xmath47 be defined recursively as @xmath48 with @xmath41 , where @xmath42 denotes the empty word .",
    "we note in passing that each recursive iteration of @xmath49 to a nonempty path maps exactly one peak to an up - step at odd height .    to show that @xmath49 is the inverse of @xmath33 , we proceed by induction on @xmath21 , the semilength of word . for @xmath50",
    ", @xmath51 now take a dyck word @xmath52 of semilength @xmath53 and assume that @xmath54 for all words @xmath55 of semilength less than @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath52 can be decomposed as either @xmath56 or @xmath57 , where the @xmath38 are dyck words of semilength strictly less than @xmath21 . hence ,",
    "by the inductive hypothesis ,    @xmath58    the number of dyck paths of semilength @xmath21 with @xmath43 contacts and @xmath1 up - steps at odd height is equal to the number of dyck paths of semilength @xmath21 with @xmath43 contacts and @xmath1 peaks .",
    "mapping a dyck path @xmath52 ( top ) with @xmath59 steps , @xmath60 up - steps at odd height and @xmath17 contact to a dyck path @xmath61 ( bottom ) with @xmath59 steps , @xmath60 peaks and @xmath17 contact , and @xmath49 performing the inverse mapping .",
    "intermediate stages after each recursive iteration of @xmath33 and @xmath49 are shown on the left and right , respectively .",
    "black dots correspond to the occurrence of empty words in the decomposition of the corresponding words.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    an example of the bijection @xmath33 and its inverse @xmath49 is given in figure [ fig ] , explicitly showing the intermediate stages after each recursive iteration .",
    "when writing the corresponding words below , we insert bracketing corresponding to the decompositions , e.g. we write @xmath62    note in particular that the double bracket @xmath63 signifies an empty word in the decomposition . for the sake of legibility",
    ", we have avoided the occurrence of composite words in this example .",
    "the mapping @xmath33 corresponding to the left arrows in figure [ fig ] is now performed as follows .",
    "@xmath64    the first recursive iteration of @xmath33 gives @xmath65 and the second step applies the recursion to the sub - words @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively . in the third step the recursion is applied to empty subwords , and hence the path no longer changes ; the corresponding figures look identical .",
    "note in particular that while @xmath66 does not change the word @xmath67 , the position of the empty word @xmath63 , and correspondingly the position of the black dot in figure [ fig ] changes .",
    "the inverse mapping @xmath49 corresponding to the right arrows in figure [ fig ] is performed similarly , with different intermediate stages .",
    "we now give an extension of @xmath33 to bilateral dyck paths . before we do this",
    ", we must define the following two maps .",
    "we define the map @xmath69 as follows . if @xmath27 is a bilateral dyck path of semilength @xmath21 with corresponding bilateral dyck word @xmath70 , where @xmath71 , then ( i ) @xmath72 , ( ii ) @xmath73 and ( iii ) @xmath74 .",
    "the map @xmath75 reflects bilateral dyck paths in the @xmath76axis .",
    "in particular , it maps nonempty dyck paths to negative dyck paths and vice versa .",
    "it maps steps at odd height to steps at even height , and vice versa .",
    "it also maps peaks to valleys , and maps valleys to peaks .",
    "we define @xmath77 as follows .",
    "if @xmath27 is a dyck path of nonzero length , the corresponding dyck word @xmath28 can be uniquely decomposed into a word of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are dyck words .",
    "then    @xmath78    the map @xmath79 is the one mentioned in section [ introduction ] , which illustrates the equinumeracy between paths with @xmath80 up - steps at odd height and @xmath1 up - steps at even height ; excepting the first up- and down - steps at height @xmath17 , @xmath79 maps steps at odd height to steps at even height , and vice versa .",
    "it preserves the number of peaks or valleys , but does not preserve the number of contacts .",
    "we note that both @xmath75 and @xmath79 are involutions .",
    "we are now in a position to state the extended bijection .",
    "let @xmath42 denote the empty word .",
    "we define @xmath81 in the following way :    * if @xmath27 is a dyck path with corresponding dyck word @xmath28 , then + @xmath82 * if @xmath27 is a negative dyck path with corresponding negative dyck word @xmath28 , then + @xmath83 * if @xmath27 is a bilateral dyck path with @xmath84 crossings then we can uniquely decompose the corresponding bilateral dyck word @xmath28 into @xmath85 , where each @xmath38 is alternately either a dyck word of nonzero length or a negative dyck word .",
    "then + @xmath86    @xmath87 gives an explicit bijection from the set of bilateral dyck paths of semilength @xmath21 with @xmath1 up - steps at odd height to the set of bilateral dyck paths of semilength @xmath21 with @xmath1 peaks .    by theorem [ theorem1 ] , ( a ) maps dyck paths with @xmath1 up - steps at odd height to dyck paths with @xmath1 peaks .",
    "if @xmath27 is a negative dyck path with @xmath1 up - steps at odd height and corresponding negative dyck word @xmath28 , then @xmath88 corresponds to a dyck path with @xmath1 up - steps at even height .",
    "applying @xmath79 to this new path gives a dyck path with @xmath80 up - steps at odd height .",
    "then @xmath89 corresponds to a dyck path with @xmath80 peaks ( and so @xmath1 valleys ) .",
    "finally , applying @xmath75 again will give a negative dyck path with @xmath1 peaks .",
    "thus ( b ) maps negative dyck paths with @xmath1 up - steps at odd height to negative dyck paths with @xmath1 peaks .",
    "application of ( c ) does not alter the parity of steps or the number of peaks .",
    "thus @xmath87 maps bilateral dyck paths with @xmath1 up - steps at odd height to bilateral dyck paths with @xmath1 peaks .",
    "we now show that @xmath87 is a bijection by giving its inverse .",
    "let @xmath90 , be defined as follows .",
    "* if @xmath27 is a dyck path with corresponding dyck word @xmath28 , then + @xmath91 * if @xmath27 is a negative dyck path with corresponding negative dyck word @xmath28 , then + @xmath92 * if @xmath27 is a bilateral dyck path with @xmath84 crossings then we can uniquely decompose the corresponding bilateral dyck word @xmath28 into @xmath85 , where each @xmath38 is alternately either a dyck word of nonzero length or a negative dyck word .",
