    "as is well known , the distribution of particles in the final state of a collision between elementary particles results from the interplay of two ingredients  @xcite .",
    "first , there is a `` phase space '' part , which reflects the kinematic constraints arising from energy and momentum conservation .",
    "then , there comes the dynamical component , namely the detailed interaction(s ) between the `` initial - state '' particles .",
    "this is arguably the most interesting part , inasmuch as one does not expect any violation of energy - momentum conservation , where the modeling enters  either first - principle based modeling for the interaction of two elementary particles , or more effective descriptions as required when more particles are involved  together with its set of assumptions and parameters .",
    "in particular , the aim of experimental investigations is to determine , or at least to constrain , those possible models , taking the conservation of energy and momentum as granted . for that purpose ,",
    "it is necessary to have a good control of the `` physically trivial '' kinematic component .    for single - particle distributions ,",
    "the effect of energy - momentum conservation is typically to limit the value of the particle momentum and to result in a depletion in the yield close to the boundary : the effect amounts to a multiplicative factor . in the case of the joint distributions of two , three or more particles ,",
    "the influence of the phase - space constraint is usually less straightforward .",
    "if there are only a few final - state particles , the joint distributions are quite constrained and the corresponding possible final states are conveniently represented on dalitz plots  @xcite .",
    "however , in high - energy collisions , in particular of heavy nuclei , where many particles are emitted , such an approach becomes impractical .",
    "one has instead to estimate the effect of total momentum conservation on a statistical basis , be it for the induced correlation between two  @xcite or more than two  @xcite particles .    here",
    ", i shall briefly recall how the multiparticle correlation induced by the conservation of total momentum can be derived in the limit of a large number of emitted particles  @xcite .",
    "then i shall focus on a case of interest for heavy - ion collision studies , namely when the emission of particles in the plane transverse to the beam is anisotropic ( i.e. , in the presence of so - called `` anisotropic flow '' ) .",
    "let us consider a collision in which @xmath0 particles are emitted , viewed in the center - of - mass frame of the particles , so that the sum of their momenta vanishes @xmath1 .",
    "this relationship induces a correlation between the momenta of @xmath2 particles chosen arbitrarily among the @xmath0 ones : technically , the corresponding joint @xmath2-particle probability distribution does not factorize into the product of the @xmath2 single - particle probability distributions , but involves non - vanishing _ cumulants _",
    "@xcite of all orders .",
    "fluctuates from event to event ( see the discussion in reference  @xcite , section  iii ) .",
    "yet , one should not forget that the problem is always present in a real experimental correlation measurement . ]",
    "the strength of the @xmath2-particle correlation depends on both @xmath2 and the total number of particles @xmath0 . in the simplest case of @xmath3 final - state particles ,",
    "the correlation is maximal , since @xmath4 ; the corresponding two - particle probability distribution @xmath5 is obviously not factorizable . in the large-@xmath0 limit , one can prove with the help of a saddle - point approximation that the @xmath2-particle cumulant scales like @xmath6  @xcite . a convenient and systematic approach to show that , as well as to obtain the explicit expressions of the cumulants , consists in using a generating function of the joint multiparticle distributions , the logarithm of which generates the cumulants .",
    "a few steps allow one to write this generating function as the integral of the exponential of @xmath0 times some function @xmath7 of the integration variable @xmath8 .",
    "the procedure to derive the successive cumulants then consists in computing to a given order in powers of @xmath9 the position of the maximum of @xmath10 , i.e.  the saddle point , then to calculate the value of @xmath10 at this maximum so as to perform the saddle - point integration  @xcite .",
    "admittedly , the cumulants induced by total momentum conservation are in general small when @xmath0 is large .",
    "however it is worth keeping their existence in mind , since they can become significant in some regions of phase space . at the same time",
    ", the correlations induced by other more dynamical phenomena which one attempts to investigate might conversely be small , and thus not necessarily significantly larger than the `` trivial '' kinematic ones .",
    "thus , it has been argued that some influence of momentum conservation on the measured two - particle short - range correlations of identical pions in @xmath11 collisions at rhic energies can be evidenced  @xcite . in heavy ion collisions , where @xmath0 is larger , momentum - conservation induced correlations are even smaller , yet they could play a non - negligible role in some studies of small signals . since it is important to have a good idea of what their effect might look like , so as to try to identify and subtract similar patterns in the measured correlations , i shall now discuss further these cumulants .",
    "the most general expressions of the two- and three - particle cumulants due to the conservation of global momentum to leading order in powers of @xmath9 , derived according to the method sketched above  @xcite , can be found in reference  @xcite ( equations ( 3.4 ) and ( 3.5 ) ) . neglecting the components of the momenta along the beam direction on rapidity  @xcite .",
    "] , i shall focus on the constraint from _ transverse _ momentum conservation .    in the heavy - ion context , the mean square momenta along the nucleus",
    " nucleus impact parameter ( i.e. , in the reaction plane ) @xmath12 and perpendicular to it in the transverse plane , @xmath13 , are generally unequal : this is the celebrated anisotropic expansion . to account for the phenomenon ,",
    "let me introduce the coefficient @xmath14 .",
    ", yielding values larger by about a factor 2 . ]",
    "note that while a fourth - harmonic modulation @xmath15 of the single - particle distribution has also been evidenced at rhic , i need not consider it here , as it would affect the cumulants induced by momentum conservation only from the four - particle cumulant onwards . introducing @xmath16 into the two - particle cumulant expression",
    ", one can recast it as @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the reaction - plane azimuth .",
    "this two - particle cumulant depends not only on the relative angle @xmath19 between the particles , but also on the absolute orientation of the particle pair with respect to the reaction plane . in turn , the joint probability distribution @xmath20 depends on the `` pair angle '' @xmath21 as well .",
    "given equation  ( [ f_c(2 ) ] ) , computing the two - particle distribution is straightforward .",
    "keeping only the second - harmonic modulation ( `` elliptic flow '' ) of the single - particle distributions , one finds @xmath22,\\ ] ] where the fourier `` pair - flow '' coefficients  @xcite that characterise the azimuthal dependence of @xmath23 depend on @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . considering only terms up to @xmath27 and @xmath28 : and @xmath0 ar sps and rhic , and",
    "is by no means mandatory . ]",

    "there are also higher harmonic terms ( @xmath34 , @xmath35  ) , which are however smaller by at least a factor @xmath36 . the effect of momentum conservation is actually subleading in the sine term  ( [ v2s(2p ) ] ) , which reflects the non - invariance of the system under the @xmath37 symmetry when the particles in the pair are different and/or have different transverse momenta  @xcite , and is mostly due to anisotropic flow . on the other hand ,",
    "momentum conservation affects the cosine term  ( [ v2c(2p ) ] ) , which is non - zero even for particles with vanishing elliptic flow . since @xmath38 at relativistic energies",
    ", @xmath39 is positive for small - angle ( @xmath40 ) or large - angle ( @xmath41 ) pairs .",
    "this means that the yield of such pairs is larger in the reaction plane ( @xmath42 ) than perpendicular to it . since @xmath43 grows with increasing transverse momentum , as does the second term in the right - hand of equation  ( [ v2c(2p ) ] ) , @xmath39 increases with both @xmath24 and @xmath25 , i.e.  the anisotropy in the pair yield increases with the particle transverse momenta .",
    "stated differently , for a pair of particles close in azimuth ( @xmath26 close to 0 ) , the anticorrelation  ( [ f_c(2 ) ] ) is smaller ( resp .",
    "larger ) when the pair azimuth is along ( resp .",
    "perpendicular to ) @xmath18 , so that the pair yield is less ( resp .",
    "more ) `` suppressed '' by momentum conservation : there are overall more particles to balance the pair momentum along @xmath18 than out - of - plane .",
    "conversely , for a pair of back - to - back particles ( @xmath44 ) momentum correlation induces a positive correlation  ( [ f_c(2 ) ] ) , which is larger if both particles lie along the reaction plane ( resulting in @xmath45 ) than perpendicular to it .    rephrasing the above in yet another manner",
    ", one can investigate the _ conditional _ probability to find an `` associated '' particle ( transverse momentum @xmath46 ) given a `` trigger''particle ( @xmath47 ) , by dividing the pair distribution @xmath23 by the single - particle distribution @xmath48 .",
    "one then finds that for a trigger along the reaction plane ( @xmath49 ) , there is a higher probability for associated particles close or away ( @xmath50 or @xmath51 ) in azimuth than around @xmath52 . on the opposite , if the trigger escapes the system perpendicular to @xmath18 , the conditional probability to find an associated particle close or back - to - back to the trigger ( @xmath50 or @xmath51 ) is smallest .",
    "these rough features , entirely dictated by elliptic flow , are illustrated in figure  [ fig : f(2|1 ) ] , where the values @xmath53",
    "gev/@xmath54 , @xmath55  gev/@xmath54 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58  mev@xmath59 and @xmath60 have been used .",
    "conditional probability distribution @xmath61 of the relative angle of an associated particle for a trigger oriented along ( full line ) or perpendicular to ( dashed line ) the reaction plane . ]    in further detail , for both in - plane or out - of - plane trigger particles , the probability for associated particles is higher away ( @xmath44 ) than close ( @xmath50 ) to the trigger : this is the trademark of the back - to - back correlation  ( [ f_c(2 ) ] ) induced by momentum conservation .",
    "now , the aim of a correlation study would be to investigate this finer structure .",
    "for that purpose , one would like to `` remove '' the anisotropic - flow - induced pattern .",
    "given the general expression of the conditional probability distribution ( resp.joint probability distribution ) as a function of the two - particle cumulant  @xcite , the most natural  although experimentally highly challenging  recipe would be to _ divide _ @xmath61 [ resp .",
    "@xmath23 ] by the single - particle distribution @xmath63 [ resp .  by the product @xmath64",
    ", so as to isolate the correlation . in equation  ( [ f_c(2 ) ] ) .",
    "however , inasmuch as it is experimentally feasible , it would indeed cancel the single - particle modulation induced by anisotropic flow , while leaving intact the azimuthal dependence of the two - particle cumulant . ]",
    "yet the usual procedure is rather to _",
    "subtract _ a flow - modulated background , whose normalization is for instance fixed by requiring that the yield vanish at its minimum ( `` zyam ''  @xcite ) . following this approach , the `` flow - subtracted distribution of associated particles '' is pictured in figure  [ fig : f(2|1)-f(2 ) ] for both in- and out - of - plane trigger particles .",
    "`` flow - subtracted distribution of associated particles '' @xmath65 vs. the relative angle , for a trigger particle along ( full line ) or perpendicular to ( dashed line ) the reaction plane .",
    "@xmath66 is fixed by the `` zyam '' condition . ]    as anticipated , this distribution is larger away from the trigger than close to it .",
    "furthermore , the away - side probability is smaller when the trigger points perpendicular to the reaction plane than when it points along @xmath18 : this was also not unexpected given the shape of the two - particle probability distribution  ( [ f(2 ) ] ) .",
    "however , the detailed structures are quite non - trivial , in particular the dip at @xmath67 in the case of an out - of - plane trigger , which both is a remnant of the `` incompletely '' subtracted anisotropic flow pattern . had been divided from the conditional probability , instead of being subtracted from it , the resulting quotient would have been a smooth first - harmonic sinusoid , rather than the curve in figure  [ fig : f(2|1)-f(2 ) ] . ]",
    "the azimuthally - dependent behaviours described above follow solely from assuming 1 .  that the particle transverse momenta sum up to 0 and 2 .  that the particle emission is anisotropic : @xmath68",
    "those mere two ingredients are enough to give rise to non - trivial structures , which then have to be disentangled from those arising from additional physical effects .",
    "two such patterns , whose analogues have reportedly been observed at rhic , were identified : ( a ) a lower away - side ( @xmath44 ) probability of associated particles in the case of an out - of - plane trigger compared to an in - plane trigger  @xcite , and ( b ) a dip in the away - side yield of associated particles  @xcite .",
    "these or similar structures have been predicted in models of parton energy loss that involve some path - length dependence  @xcite [ pattern ( a ) ] , or as signature of the interaction ( `` mach cone '' , `` gluon bresstrahlung '' , `` cerenkov ring '' , `` jet deflection '' , see e.g.  reference  @xcite ) between the away - side parton and the medium through which it propagate [ structure ( b ) ] . if such models are to yield _ quantitative _ results , the possible contribution to the data of `` trivial '' correlations induced by momentum - conservation has to be investigated seriously .",
