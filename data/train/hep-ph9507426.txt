    "<S> significance would be slightly improved with @xmath118 gev instead , but high luminosity may be harder to achieve here .    if a @xmath119 or @xmath120 decay signal were to be established ( via @xmath66 or @xmath121 coupling ) , it would imply a corresponding resonance@xcite in the @xmath122 channel  or indeed for @xmath123 if both @xmath121 and @xmath124 were significant . </S>",
    "<S> such a resonance would have a large peak cross section of order @xmath125 , four orders of magnitude above @xmath126 , but a very narrow width ; for the case @xmath127 gev , the upper limits@xcite @xmath128 and @xmath129 indicate a width of 10 mev at best , and it could be very much smaller . </S>",
    "<S> if these couplings were indeed near their upper limits above , such a resonance could be detected by a suitable scan ; indeed , the absence of corrections to bhabha scattering at tristan already imposes significant further limits@xcite for @xmath130 gev . </S>",

    "<S> decays @xmath136 with at least one tau lepton are not disfavored and neither are analogous hadronic decays like eq.([eq : dec2 ] ) .    our results may be summarized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> + ( 1 ) we have shown that sneutrino pair production with rpv decays can give substantial and distinctive four - lepton or four - jet and possibly dilepton - dijet signals at the future upgraded lep collider , if the lsp is a sneutrino and sneutrinos have approximately degenerate mass @xmath137 gev . </S>",
    "<S> + ( 2 ) production of @xmath138 pairs gives the biggest signals ; @xmath139 and @xmath140 signals are similar but could have different lepton / jet flavors ( if all sneutrinos decay directly via rpv ) or could be essentially the same ( if heavier sneutrinos decay first to the lsp , with negligible emission of soft particles ) . </S>",
    "<S> all sneutrino signals will generally be indistinguishable in the four - jet modes , in the absence of jet - flavor tagging . </S>",
    "<S> + ( 3 ) all signals have narrow dilepton and/or dijet invariant mass peaks at @xmath141 , and may also possess displaced - decay - vertex signatures . </S>",
    "<S> + ( 4 ) the signals are cleanest in the four - lepton channels ( @xmath65-dominated decays ) , where there is little sm background . in the four - jet channel </S>",
    "<S> the most serious background appears to be @xmath7 production , which is tolerable for @xmath142 gev but obliterates signals near @xmath143 ( unless additional @xmath77-tag or displaced - vertex signatures are present ) . </S>",
    "<S> + ( 5 ) if a @xmath119 or @xmath120 decay signal were established , the corresponding @xmath144 resonance signals@xcite could be detectable via a dedicated scan at lower energy , but only if its coupling @xmath62 were not too far from the present upper limit . </S>",
    "<S> possible @xmath145 signals would be unfeasible to detect at hadron colliders . </S>",
    "<S> + ( 6 ) the absence of reported @xmath146 signals ( @xmath147 ) at hadron colliders , however , suggests that @xmath148 decays are unimportant , unless susy hadroproduction is suppressed by high mass thresholds .    </S>",
