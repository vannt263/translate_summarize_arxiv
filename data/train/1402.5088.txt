    "pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) are created by fast spinning neutron stars that produce highly relativistic magnetized particle winds , inflating an expanding bubble , confined by the expanding ejecta of the supernova explosion .",
    "electrons and positrons are accelerated to relativistic speeds at the termination shock and interact with the magnetic field generating a synchrotron emitting nebula , called a pulsar wind nebula .",
    "a pwn is characterized by a central concentration of radio continuum emission that gradually declines to the outer edge , in contrast to the more common shell - type supernova remnants ( snrs ) , which have a limb - brightened appearance .",
    "pwne typically have flat radio continuum spectra with a spectral index @xmath5 between 0.0 and @xmath60.3 ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 : flux density , @xmath9 : frequency ) , although steeper spectra have been observed for pwne da495 @xcite and g76.9@xmath01.1 @xcite .",
    "many of these pwne , in particular most of the very bright objects like the crab nebula and 3c58 , do not show an accompanying shell - type snr .",
    "this is very puzzling since typically they are relatively young so that the actual remnant of the supernova should not have dissipated , yet .",
    "the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has portrayed the outer galactic plane with excellent sensitivity and fidelity to extended emission in radio continuum and hi .",
    "these qualities have led to the discovery of 13 supernova remnants ( snrs ) over the past 12 years @xcite .",
    "radio continuum observations at 408  mhz and 1420  mhz were obtained with the dominion radio astrophysical observatory s synthesis telescope ( st , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the main characteristics of this survey are the same as for the cgps @xcite .",
    "the drao st provides observations of linearly polarized emission at four frequency bands around the hi line to allow precise determination of rotation measures ( rms ) .",
    "those bands are 7.5  mhz wide with center frequencies at 1406.9  mhz ( band a ) , 1413.8  mhz ( band b ) , 1427.4  mhz ( band c ) , and 1434.3  mhz ( band d ) .",
    "angular resolution varies slightly across the final maps as cosec(declination ) . at the centre of g141.2@xmath05.0",
    "the resolution in the final maps is @xmath10 ( dec @xmath11 r.a . ) for 1420  mhz continuum , @xmath12 for hi , and @xmath13 for 408  mhz continuum .",
    "the rms noise in the final images is 180  @xmath14jy / beam for the 1420  mhz continuum data , 2  k  t@xmath15 for the hi data , and 2  mjy / beam for the 408  mhz data .",

    ", we also display images from the westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss ) at 327  mhz @xcite and the vla low - frequency sky survey redux ( vlssr ) at 74  mhz @xcite . in the 1420  mhz image , with the best image quality and resolution",
    ", this source appears as a diffuse extended radio source with a bright compact core .",
    "it is somewhat elongated along r.a . and has a length of @xmath16 and a height of @xmath17 . for the radio spectrum determination we use the catalogue flux density at 232  mhz from the miyun 232  mhz survey @xcite , where g141.2@xmath05.0 is not resolved .",
    "the flux density at 5  ghz was determined with the specfind cross identification catalogue @xcite . for the other surveys",
    "the flux density has been integrated in concentric rings starting at the radio peak of the source at 1420  mhz ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we used this approach rather than simply using the catalogued fluxes , because sources are typically fitted with a gaussian model , which may not describe a resolved source very well . in figure",
    "[ fig : tp ] a small extension from the source to the north is apparent , most likely an unrelated , extragalactic steep - spectrum source .",
    "it is obvious from the images in figure  [ fig : tp ] that this source becomes more dominant for longer wavelength . in the drao st and the wenss",
    "images it is clearly a weak insignificant object , but in the vlssr image it becomes a bright source with significant flux contribution .",
    "we fitted a gaussian to this point source in the 1420  mhz maps and the wenss data to determine its spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec+rm ] ) .",
    "we removed its contribution from the integrated flux densities of the extended source .",
    "the final flux densities are listed in table  [ tab : flux ] and the integrated radio continuum spectrum of g141.2 + 5.0 is displayed in figure  [ fig : spec+rm ] .",
    "we found a straight spectrum between 74  mhz and 5  ghz with a spectral index of @xmath19 .",
    "the polarization image of g141.2 + 5.0 is shown in figure  [ fig : pi ] . in polarization ,",
    "similar to total power , it has a compact bright core , but its peak is offset from the total power peak and it is elongated north - south .",
    "there are two faint arc - like features on either side of the core visible in polarized intensity .",
    "the integrated polarized flux in the drao st observations is @xmath20  mjy .",
    "this results in a total fractional polarization of 15  % at 1420  mhz .",
    "the peak polarization is more than 40  % .",
    "since the drao st provides observations of linearly polarized emission at four frequency bands we are able to calculate rms . in our observations of g141.2 + 5.0 only the polarized core is sufficiently bright to have a large enough signal - to - noise ratio in the individual bands . in figure",
    "[ fig : spec+rm ] , we provide a rm spectrum for this central core .",
    "the resulting faraday rotation is @xmath21  radm@xmath22 .",
    "g141.2 + 5.0 is listed in the nvss rotation measure catalogue @xcite with an rm of @xmath23  radm@xmath22 .",
    "however , @xcite just took the rm at the location of the total power peak of each source . in the case of g141.2 + 5.0 , which is an extended source in the nvss",
    ", there is a strong gradient in polarized intensity ( see figure  [ fig : pi ] ) , making this value unreliable .",
    "from our data alone we can not distinguish between foreground and internal faraday rotation .",
    "the 3d - models of the galactic magnetic fields , cosmic - ray , and thermal electrons by @xcite and @xcite give a foreground rotation measure of @xmath24  radm@xmath22 for the direction of g141.2 + 5.0 and a distance of 4  kpc ( see section 4.2 ) , consistent with values found in the nvss rm catalogue @xcite in this area of the galaxy .",
    "this indicates significant internal faraday rotation for g141.2 + 5.0 .      in figure  [",
    "fig : hi ] , we display hi images of the area around g141.2 + 5.0 . in the top",

    "g141.2 + 5.0 is located in the centre of a depression , which is in most directions surrounded by a broken hi shell .",
    "this hi shell is also visible in the r.a .- v and v - dec slices displayed in figure  [ fig : hi ] as a distinct feature .",
    "the distribution of the hi emission indicates that this hi feature actually is a broken hi shell expanding at a rate of @xmath25  kms@xmath2 as indicated by the dashed white circles .",
    "this is probably an old hi bubble that has slowed down to a velocity close to the sound speed of the ambient medium and is therefore breaking up . the systemic velocity can be derived from the circles indicating the extend of the hi structure in the r.a .- v and v - dec slices to be @xmath26  kms@xmath2 .",
    "in an ongoing survey of an area in the so - called fan region , we have serendipitously discovered a previously unidentified diffuse and extended ( @xmath27 ) radio continuum source g141.2 + 5.0 .",
    "the fan region is a highly linearly polarized feature that extends above the mid - plane from a galactic longitude of @xmath28 to just beyond the anti - centre ( see figure 11 in * ? ? ?",
    "g141.2 + 5.0 is highly linearly polarized with an integrated fractional polarization of about 15  % and a peak of more than 40  % .",
    "it shows a steep radio continuum spectrum with a spectral index of @xmath19 .",
    "we have tried to identify this source in surveys available through the skyview virtual telescope database .",
    "but we found no counterpart outside the long - wavelength radio regime . since , in particular , we did not find any counterpart in the infrared we can dismiss the possibility that this source may be an hii region or a nearby galaxy .",
    "one possible explanation we like to briefly discuss is diffuse synchrotron emission related to a galaxy cluster , like a halo or a relic , even though the hi shell we found seems to locate g141.2 + 5.0 inside the milky way galaxy .",
    "@xcite report that radio haloes are filling the central areas of galaxy clusters .",
    "they have diffuse quite regular structure with very low linear polarization , low radio surface brightness , and very steep radio continuum spectra with @xmath29 . the low fractional polarization and the very steep radio spectra typically found in haloes",
    "make this an unlikely explanation for g141.2 + 5.0 .",
    "g141.2 + 5.0 is too bright , highly polarized , and the radio spectrum is too flat .",
    "@xcite also discuss that cluster radio relics are generally filamentary features and commonly found in merging clusters mostly related to shocks .",
    "they can be highly linearly polarized at the 10 - 30% level and are located at the cluster periphery .",
    "similar to the haloes they have steep radio continuum spectra with @xmath29 .",
    "even though some characteristics of relics are similar to those we found in g141.2 + 5.0 , the steep radio spectra and the filamentary structure make it very unlikely that g141.2 + 5.0 is a radio relic of a galaxy cluster .    in particular",
    ", since the extended radio source g141.2 + 5.0 seems to be located inside an expanding hi bubble , but also because of the characteristics of its radio continuum emission , the remnant of a supernova is the most likely explanation . while the structure of g141.2 + 5.0 , a central concentration of radio continuum emission that gradually declines to the outer edge , indicates a pulsar wind nebula , the steep radio continuum spectrum is more reminiscent of a shell - type remnant . however , there are examples for steep spectrum pulsar wind nebulae .",
    "the pwn da495 has a much steeper radio continuum spectrum than g141.2 + 5.0 beyond its cooling break frequency of 1.3  ghz @xcite and the pwn g76.9 + 1.1 displays a radio continuum spectrum with a spectral index of @xmath30 @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the steep spectra are explained by aging , although the recent discovery of a very young energetic pulsar in g76.9 + 1.1 indicates a young age for the pwn @xcite . since",
    "shell - type remnants are created by the shockwave of the supernova explosion they always are limb - brightened .",
    "g141.2 + 5.0 is well resolved in our data with a diameter of more than 4 beams . if it was a shell - type snr it would have an emission hole in the center or have an arc - like appearance .",
    "therefore we conclude that g141.2 + 5.0 is most likely a newly identified pulsar wind nebula .",
    "g141.2@xmath05.0 is observed towards @xmath315@xmath32 , well above the maximum latitude to which the perseus arm is traced .",
    "quadrant ii perseus arm regions are found with a mean latitude @xmath330@xmath342 , with 34 out of 37 within @xmath352@xmath32 and none at @xmath36 + 3@xmath32 ( see catalogue of * ? ? ?",
    "further , the systemic velocity of g141.2@xmath05.0 is with @xmath26  kms@xmath2 significantly more negative than perseus arm ( @xmath3739  km  s@xmath2 in the midplane ) .",
    "kinematically then , g141.2@xmath05.0 is not within the perseus arm , but in the cygnus spiral arm , the next major star - forming arm about 2.5  kpc beyond perseus up in the warped disc @xcite . in @xcite five nearby cygnus arm regions ( sh2 - 192 , 193 , 196 , lbn676 & sh2 - 204 ) with comparable @xmath38 to g141.2@xmath05.0 have a mean distance among them of 3.8@xmath41.1  kpc .",
    "to estimate the distance to g141.2@xmath05.0 we use the modelling method of @xcite to predict the line - of - sight run of velocity with heliocentric distance , that , along with a simple density model of the disk , best describes the observed profile in this direction .",
    "the variation in the fitted parameters among many modelling runs captures the uncertainty in the model and in the distance to the object",
    ". we also account for an uncertainty in the shell itself of @xmath393.4  km  s@xmath2 ( estimated from such shells around regions ; see * ? ? ?",
    "the final kinematic distance to g141.2@xmath05.0 is 4.0@xmath40.5  kpc .",
    "g141.2@xmath05.0 is likely the remnant of a massive star that originally formed in the cygnus arm , an active star - forming arm well populated with bright ob stars @xcite and regions @xcite . despite our favourable view no cygnus arm supernova remnants ( including pwne )",
    "have been conclusively identified .",
    "g141.2@xmath05.0 thus represents the first .",
    "the newly discovered pwn g141.2 + 5.0 has a diameter of about 4pc the same as the young pwn 3c58 @xcite .",
    "there is no published detection of a pulsar nearby , most likely because there has not been a deep survey for pulsars in this area of the galaxy , yet .",
    "g141.2 + 5.0 adds to the growing number of pwne that are found without an associated shell - type snr . since we still do not know why this is the case , in particular for young pwne like the crab nebula and 3c58 , every new discovery will get us closer to finding the solution for this mystery",
    "there are many possible explanations for the lack of a radio shell : low explosion energy , low ambient density , or low ambient magnetic field , to name just a few .",
    "given the stark contrast between the number of shell - type snrs in the nearby perseus arm and none identified in cygnus , the lack of an accompanying radio shell may not be a coincidence , but rather reflective of a different nature of cygnus arm supernovae and their environments .",
    "however , since we have only one example it may just be a coincidence .",
    "g141.2 + 5.0 is the only member of this group that has a small hi bubble around it .",
    "the hi emission of this feature is , with a few kelvin above the background , very faint and we only were able to detect it , because it is not confused by much other galactic hi emission .",
    "the hi shell has a diameter of about @xmath40 which translates to 14  pc at a distance of 4  kpc . at this distance",
    "the shell contains about 35  m@xmath41 ( @xmath42  % ) of material , assuming that 10% of the atoms are helium and the hi gas is optically thin .",
    "the low brightness temperature makes this a valid assumption .",
    "this would translate to a pre - bubble density of @xmath43  @xmath44 .",
    "if we assume that the hi shell is the missing snr shell , it would be close to merging with the interstellar medium ( ism ) as evident from the low expansion velocity and the fact that it is breaking apart . from @xcite , assuming solar abundances , we find for a highly evolved snr : @xmath45^{1.16}\\,\\left   [ \\frac{v}{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}\\right ] ^{1.35}\\,\\left [ \\frac{r}{\\rm pc}\\right ] ^{3.16 } \\\\   & = 2.76\\times 10^{47}~{\\rm erg } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] here @xmath46 is the explosion energy , @xmath47 the ambient density , @xmath48 the shock velocity , and @xmath49 is the radius",
    ". the dynamic age of the shell would be about 350,000 years .",
    "this is an extremely low value for the explosion energy and a very old snr ( and pwn ) .",
    "if the hi shell is the stellar wind bubble of the progenitor star , the lack of a shell - type remnant could be explained by assuming that the snr shock wave did not reach the hi shell , yet , and is still expanding freely into its low density interior . from @xcite",
    ", we find a dynamic age for this bubble of about 700,000 years .",
    "this is extremely young and only very few exceptionally massive stars have such a short life .",
    "but those stars would produce a massive stellar wind depositing @xmath50  erg and a lot of material into the ism .",
    "however , stellar winds of massive stars have several phases , an early high velocity low - mass - loss wind during their main sequence time and a slow high - mass - loss wind later on .",
    "@xcite found hi structures very similar to the shell we found around g141.2 + 5.0 in the massive stellar cluster westerlund  1 .",
    "they suggested that these consist of recombined material lost by massive stars in a late high - mass - loss wind .",
    "the supernova shockwave could have swept up that material into this shell .",
    "again we would need a highly evolved snr and a low energy explosion .",
    "given the discussion above , we propose that g141.2 + 5.0 is a pulsar wind nebula and the hi shell we found around it is the highly evolved shell - type supernova remnant consisting of swept up high - mass - loss wind material ejected by the progenitor star .",
    "in this case the progenitor must have been a massive star , probably of o - type .",
    "g141.2 + 5.0 is only detected at radio frequencies .",
    "we did not find a counterpart in publically available x - ray or @xmath51-ray surveys such as the fermi survey .",
    "this is not untypical for a highly evolved pwn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "pointed follow - up observations with the chandra satellite may provide crucial information in solving the mysteries around this newly discovered pwn .",
    "g141.2 + 5.0 is a new radio pulsar wind nebula discovered in follow - up observations of the canadian galactic plane survey , and the first radio pwn discovered since g63.7@xmath01.1 was reported by @xcite some 17 years ago .",
    "the pwn is a resident of the cygnus arm about 4  kpc away and is the first snr discovered in that spiral arm .",
    "it displays a steep radio continuum spectrum and has a high level of linear polarization .",
    "it sits inside an expanding hi shell , which very likely is related to the expanding shell - type remnant of the same supernova explosion at a highly advanced phase of evolution .",
    "this may identify pulsar wind nebulae without an accompanying shell - type remnant as the result of a low energy supernova explosion .",
