    "in the standard model of electroweak interactions , the elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix  @xcite are constrained by unitarity .",
    "therefore , experimental measurements of the precise values of the ckm matrix elements are important to understand the phenomenology of weak interactions .    in the framework of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )",
    "@xcite , the semileptonic decay @xmath1 is amongst the cleanest modes that can be used to measure the ckm matrix element @xmath67 .",
    "the differential decay rate for @xmath1 can be expressed as  @xcite    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the fermi coupling constant , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the masses of the @xmath72 and @xmath73 mesons respectively .",
    "the variable @xmath74 denotes the inner product of the @xmath72 and @xmath73 meson four - velocities , which is related to @xmath75 , the mass squared of the lepton - neutrino system : @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the form factor . by extrapolating the measured @xmath78 to the point of zero recoil of the @xmath73 meson",

    "represents the four - momentum vector of the particle in subscript , while @xmath80 denotes the three - momentum vector in the center of mass ( cm ) frame and @xmath81 is the three - momentum vector in the laboratory frame .",
    "@xmath67 measurements made using @xmath82 decays are less precise than those made using @xmath83 , due to the suppressed decay rate near the point of zero recoil , substantial feed down from @xmath83 and the large combinatoric background from fake @xmath84 mesons .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath82 measurement provides a consistency check , and allows a test of heavy - quark symmetry  @xcite through the precise measurement of the form factor .",
    "furthermore , this decay has one experimental advantage over @xmath83 as there is no slow pion involved .",
    "the @xmath1 decay is preferred to @xmath85 because it has much less feed - down background from excited charm meson states .",
    "good particle identification and vertexing capabilities allow effective reduction of the combinatoric background .    in this paper",
    "we report measurements of the branching fraction of the semileptonic decay @xmath1 , the ckm matrix element @xmath86 and the form factor @xmath77 .",
    "the lepton @xmath87 can be either an electron or a muon , and the use of the charge - conjugate mode is implied .",
    "the data sample used in this analysis was collected with the belle detector  @xcite at kekb  @xcite , an asymmetric @xmath88 collider .",
    "the data sample has an integrated luminosity of @xmath89 fb@xmath90 and contains @xmath91 @xmath92 pairs .",
    "another data sample with an integrated luminosity of @xmath93 fb@xmath90 was taken at an energy 60 mev below the @xmath10 resonance , and is used as a control sample to check the @xmath94 continuum background determination .",
    "belle is a large solid - angle spectrometer based on a 1.5  t superconducting solenoid magnet .",
    "charged particle tracking is provided by a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) and a central drift chamber ( cdc ) that surround the interaction region .",
    "the svd consists of three approximately cylindrical layers of double - sided silicon strip detectors ; one side of each detector measures the @xmath95 coordinate and the other the @xmath96 coordinate .",
    "the cdc has 50 cylindrical layers of anode wires ; the inner three layers have instrumented cathodes for @xmath95 coordinate measurements .",
    "eighteen of the wire layers are inclined at small angles to provide small - angle stereo measurements of @xmath95 coordinates along the particle trajectories .",
    "the charged particle acceptance covers the laboratory polar angle between @xmath97 and @xmath98 , corresponding to about 92% of the full cm frame solid angle . the momentum resolution for charged tracks",
    "is determined from cosmic rays and @xmath99 events to be @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the transverse momentum in @xmath102 .",
    "charged hadron identification is provided by @xmath103 measurements in the cdc , a mosaic of 1188 aerogel erenkov counters ( acc ) , and a barrel - like array of 128 time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) .",
    "the @xmath103 measurements have a resolution for hadron tracks of 6.9% and are useful for @xmath104 separation for @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the tof system has a time resolution for hadrons of @xmath107  ps and provides @xmath104 separation for @xmath108 .",
    "the acc covers the range @xmath109 , and the refractive indices of the acc elements vary with polar angle to match the kinematics of the asymmetric energy collisions .",
    "high momentum tagged kaons and pions from kinematically selected @xmath110 , @xmath111 decays are used to determine a charged kaon identification efficiency of 88% and a misidentification probability of 9% .",
    "electromagnetic showering particles are detected in an array of 8736 csi(tl ) crystals located in the magnetic volume covering the same solid angle as the charged particle tracking system .",

    "the overall detection efficiency for neutral pions from @xmath118 events ( including the effects of geometrical acceptance ) is @xmath119 .",
    "electron identification in belle is based on a combination of @xmath103 measurements in the cdc , the response of the acc , the position and shape of the electromagnetic shower , and the ratio @xmath120 of cluster energy registered in the calorimeter and particle momentum .",
    "the electron identification efficiency , determined by embedding monte carlo ( mc )  @xcite tracks in multihadron data , is greater than 92% for tracks with @xmath121 .",

    "this detection system consists of alternating layers of charged - particle detectors and 4.7  cm thick steel plates .",
    "the total steel thickness of 65.8 cm plus the material of the inner detector corresponds to 4.7 nuclear interaction lengths at normal incidence .",
    "the system covers polar angles between @xmath124 and @xmath125 ; the overall muon identification efficiency , determined by a track embedding study similar to that used for the electron case , is greater than 87% for tracks with @xmath126 .",
    "the corresponding pion misidentification probability determined from inclusive @xmath127 decays is less than 2% .",
    "for hadronic event selection , we require that each event have at least 5 well - reconstructed charged tracks , a total visible energy of at least 0.15 times the cm energy and an event vertex that is consistent with the known interaction point .",
    "continuum background events are suppressed by requiring the normalized second fox - wolfram moment  @xcite to be less than 0.4 .",
    "this analysis is based on the neutrino reconstruction method , which exploits the hermeticity of the detector and the near zero value of the neutrino mass .",
    "this method was originally developed by the cleo collaboration for the measurement of @xmath128 and @xmath129 decays  @xcite .",
    "we extract information on the neutrino from the missing momentum ( @xmath130 ) and missing energy ( @xmath131 ) in each event . in the cm frame ,",
    "the total momentum of the system is zero , and the total energy is the sum of the two beam energies ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "the missing energy , momentum and missing mass are calculated as follows : @xmath133 @xmath134 @xmath135    where the sums are over all reconstructed particles @xmath136 in the event .    in calculating the missing energy and momentum , we identify each charged particle using the lepton and hadron identification devices .",
    "we also add the neutral showers recorded in the ecl that are not matched to any charged track .",
    "moreover , we require that the shower shape be consistent with that of a photon and the deposited energy be greater than @xmath137 for the barrel region and @xmath138 for the endcap .    if the only undetected particle in an event is the neutrino , the missing mass should be consistent with zero .",
    "due to the presence of a tail in the missing mass distribution originating from missing particles , an asymmetric requirement @xmath139 is applied . in principle , this selects events where there is only one undetected particle in the event and that missing particle is the neutrino .",
    "neutrinos are usually produced in conjunction with charged leptons ( @xmath140 or @xmath141 ) .",
    "therefore , the presence of two or more leptons in an event implies that the missing energy and momentum can not be used to accurately reconstruct the neutrino from the @xmath1 decay .",
    "for this reason , we select events with only one identified lepton with @xmath142 .",
    "the momentum requirement helps to reduce the signal efficiency loss due to lepton misidentification , and also reduces the backgrounds from hadrons misidentified as leptons and random combinations of leptons and @xmath73 mesons .",
    "since the initial state is charge - neutral , the charges of the reconstructed tracks should sum to zero if we detect all the particles in the event and have no additional tracks .",
    "hence , we require that the net charge , @xmath143 , in the event should be close to zero to reject events with other missing charged particles .",
    "we allow @xmath144 , as well as 0 , to maintain high signal efficiency .",
    "the neutrino reconstruction can be biased by particles that go undetected by passing down the beam pipe . to reject events with such missing particles , we require @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the polar angle of the missing momentum with respect to the positron beam direction in the laboratory frame .",
    "@xmath73 candidates are reconstructed in the @xmath147 decay mode .",
    "kaon candidates are required to be positively identified by the hadron identification devices .",
    "in addition , we require kaon candidates not to be positively identified as either a lepton or a proton . if a charged particle is not positively identified as a lepton , kaon , or proton , we treat it as a pion .",
    "the three charged tracks are then geometrically fit to a @xmath73 decay vertex , and we reject combinations which do not form a consistent vertex .",
    "we further require @xmath148 in order to suppress continuum background .",
    "we select @xmath149 combinations where the invariant mass is within 20 @xmath150 of the nominal @xmath73 mass ( figure  [ mdplot ] ) .",
    "to reduce the feed - down background from @xmath151 decays , we reject @xmath73 candidates that are consistent with being produced in the decay @xmath152 .",
    "we select @xmath153 candidates by requiring that the two photon invariant mass be within @xmath154 of the nominal @xmath153 mass , where the energy of each photon is required to be greater than 20  @xmath155 .",
    "we calculate the mass difference @xmath156 and if it is within @xmath157 of the nominal value for a @xmath158 decay , the @xmath73 candidate is rejected .",
    "a variable @xmath159 is defined as the cosine of the angle between @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "it satisfies the following kinematic relation : @xmath162 the signal events are distributed mostly within the physically allowed region @xmath163 , while the background events extend to a much wider range .",
    "we require that candidates have @xmath164 .",
    "since the resolution of the missing momentum is better than that of the missing energy , we take @xmath165 as the four - momentum of the neutrino . combining the energy - momentum four - vectors for the reconstructed @xmath73 meson , the signal lepton and the neutrino , and using the constraint of energy - momentum conservation",
    ", we obtain the fully reconstructed @xmath0 decay variables , the beam constrained mass @xmath166 and the energy difference @xmath167 defined as @xmath168 @xmath169    we select events with @xmath167 in the range @xmath170 ; the asymmetric requirement is to reject feed - down background from @xmath151 decays . in the calculation of @xmath166 ( equation  [ eqmb ] ) we correct @xmath171 by the factor @xmath172 which is equivalent to imposing @xmath173 .",
