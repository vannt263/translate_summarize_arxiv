    "the orbital angular momentum of electromagnetic beams now takes an important position in various fields of research and applications , ranging from manipulating and orienting small particles , astronomy and astrophysics , novel wireless communication concepts , quantum entanglement , cryptography , and quantum computation . applications for the use of the orbital angular momentum in the radio domain , allowing digital manipulation under software control , were proposed in ref .  , including radio astronomy and space physics .    in the literature",
    ", different views can be found concerning the possibility of separating the spin and orbital angular momentum ; see refs .  .",
    "in computing the electromagnetic beams emitted by a circular antenna array , and expressing the angular momentum density explicitly in terms of helicity and vorticity , the present paper shows that the angular momentum of the emitted beams can be clearly separated into parts that belong to helicity and vorticity , respectively .",
    "the separation is associated with the separation of angular momentum into spin and orbital parts , a result that has been previously shown for optical beams .",
    "crucial for the analytic computation is the fact that the radiated densities of energy , linear momentum , and angular momentum are homogeneous functions of distance .",
    "this allows to neglect certain terms in the expressions for these quantities . since helicity and vorticity",
    "are uniquely linked to the phases of the transverse field components , it is possible to emit and detect em beams with spin and orbital angular momentum via transverse field triangulation , dealing solely with first order quantities which can easily be utilized without the need to measure weak longitudinal components .    in order to simplify the present analysis ,",

    "often , spin is identified with polarization .",
    "we emphasize that this is not allowed for the spin angular momentum _ density _ ; only the total spin angular momentum can be identified with polarization .",
    "for instance , taking @xmath80 and @xmath12 , the spin angular momentum density vanishes on the @xmath88 axis , see fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ( left ) , whereas the electric and magnetic fields are maximal on the @xmath88 axis and are right - hand circular polarized .",

    "based on an idea put forward by carozzi @xcite , let us replace the transverse crossed dipoles of the circular antenna array by electric dipoles that point in the longitudinal direction and feed the longitudinal dipole antennas with the currents @xmath120 then the vector potential reads @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath28 are as given in section  [ sec : a ] .",
    "evaluating the densities of energy , linear momentum , and angular momentum , we obtain @xmath123 @xmath124 and @xmath125    it is useful to compare these densities with those given in section [ sec : w , p , j ] , eqs . ( [ w])([j ] ) .",
    "the essential difference is in the angular momentum density . for pure longitudinal currents ,",
    "there is only an orbital part , @xmath126 and the spin part vanishes , @xmath127 this shows that electromagnetic waves associated with pure longitudinal currents can carry orbital , but no spin angular momentum ; cf .",
    "the discussion of longitudinal plasma modes in ref .  .",
    "because of the term @xmath128 the beams of electromagnetic waves associated with longitudinal currents have a deep null along their axis of propagation which gives rise to a doughnut shaped beam profile , even in the absence of any topological charge .",
    "the lois radio facility , currently under construction in sweden , is the only device that utilizes 3d vector sensing antennas and is readily able to detect these waves .",
    "other radio telescopes , e.g. , lofar @xcite and ska @xcite , can be easily reconfigured to achieve the same capability .",
    "from the previous sections one might get the impression that the analysis is specific to radio beams emitted by a circular antenna array . however , as we now will show , the analysis is more general and device independent .",
    "any device or source that generates a current distribution on a circle @xmath129 where @xmath130 , and @xmath88 are cylindrical coordinates , results in the vector potential @xmath131 with @xmath132 and @xmath133 cf .",

    "( [ c2 ] ) , there is no need for the current distribution on the circle itself .",
    "mathematically speaking , the current distribution can be along any path that encircles the origin , provided that the residue is kept unchanged and that no further vortices contribute .",
    "moreover , the current distribution can be chosen arbitrarily in the @xmath134 plane , provided that the residue is kept unchanged . even if the residue changes , assuming that eqs .",

    "if integrated , most of the interferences vanish .",
    "this allows to carry over the principle of superposition of electromagnetic waves to their mechanical properties , @xmath140 however , for certain quantities the interferences do not cancel : @xmath141 the consequences of this is the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "if , as in section [ sec : cont ] , the sources are continuous , the analysis is exact in the far field and the number of orbital angular momentum states is unbounded . in contrast , if the sources are discrete , the presented analysis is an approximation .",
    "luckily , the approximation improves very fast with the number of discrete sources , and there is typically no need to worry about the accuracy .    however , for the case that only very few discrete sources are present , or if one is interested in the number of orbital angular momentum states that can be utilized , we propose an alternative approach .",
    "namely , starting from a continuous source distribution the discrete nature of the sources is imposed via a `` pacman '' shaped mask that has slits at the appropriate positions . due to fourier convolution with the mask ,",
    "the uncertainty principle enters and gives rise to a distribution in the orbital angular momentum .",
    "this distribution has a periodicity of @xmath15 and peaks of width proportional to @xmath142 limiting the number of orbital angular momentum states that can be utilized in a circular array of @xmath15 equidistributed discrete sources to @xmath143 where the implied constant in the last term depends on the noise level and on the details of the discrete sources .",
    "our analysis of the properties of radio beams emitted by a circular antenna array highlights analytically profound aspects of the beam spin and orbital angular momentum .",
    "namely , how the beams are connected to helicity and vorticity ; that the angular momentum of the beams is an intrinsic property ; that it is transported all the way out to infinity ; that it can be separated into spin and orbital angular momentum ; and that spin , unlike its density , can be identified with polarization .    in particular , separating the angular momentum into spin and orbital angular momentum , we find that the density of orbital angular momentum depends on the vorticity only and can be expressed in quite simple terms , whereas the density of spin angular momentum depends on both helicity and vorticity .",
    "the approach via an antenna array illuminates the physics from a new perspective and confirms previous studies of orbital angular momentum of electromagnetic beams .",
    "emerging as a byproduct , but being of interest in its own , is the finding in section [ sec : long ] .",
