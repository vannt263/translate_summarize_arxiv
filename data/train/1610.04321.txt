    "atomic parity nonconservation ( apnc ) measurements continue to be of interest for the breadth of physics they may illuminate @xcite . presently , several experiments are underway to search for parity violating effects in atoms and molecules @xcite .",
    "one path being pursued for next - generation apnc studies is to investigate the effect in single trapped atomic ions , following the approach proposed in @xcite , for which ba@xmath2 is exemplar . in that system ,",
    "the largest observable consequence of apnc is the emergence of a small electric - dipole transition moment ( e1@xmath4 ) between the ion s 6s@xmath5 ground states and its low - laying metastable 5d@xmath6 states .",
    "in addition to e1@xmath4 , there is also an electric - quadrupole transition moment ( e2 ) and magnetic - dipole transition moment ( m1 ) connecting those states . to measure e1@xmath4 , the size of these other , much larger",
    ", transition moments must be known .",
    "some work has been undertaken that placed e2 at 12.7 ( @xmath7 ) @xmath8 @xcite , where @xmath9 is the electron charge and @xmath10 is the bohr radius , however , to the best of our knowledge , no measurement of m1 has been done and there is significant disagreement among the numerical studies @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the results of our experimental study of m1 and place an upper bound on the moment .",
    "the principal challenge in measuring the 6s@xmath11 5d@xmath6 m1 transition matrix element in ba@xmath2 is that its effect must be isolated from the much larger e2 coupling .",
    "these two transition moments explicitly are ,    [ eq : m1e2 ] @xmath12 @xmath13    where the operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 are defined as ,    [ eq : m1e2op ] @xmath16 @xmath17    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the ( electric ) quadrupole and ( magnetic ) dipole operators , respectively , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the applied electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the matrix element e2 is known , to the 1 % level , to be 12.7 ( @xmath7 ) @xmath8 @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , only three calculations of m1 have been performed which , in terms of the bohr magneton @xmath22 , have given ; @xmath23 the large range of values obtained in those studies has been attributed to those author s estimations of electron - electron correlation effects in the atom @xcite . that discrepancy withstanding , there is agreement on its order of magnitude , which places m1/e2 at @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "+ for any of the @xmath26 transitions in ba@xmath2 , which have their resonances nominally at 2.051 @xmath27 m , the total rabi frequency ignoring apnc , @xmath28 , is , @xmath29 we seek m1 within the @xmath30 m = 0 transition between the 6s@xmath5(m = -1/2 ) and 5d@xmath6(m = -1/2 ) states , for which , in terms of the reduced transition matrix elements of eq .",

    "the @xmath36 and @xmath37 delimiters on the driving field components describe their orientation relative to the plane spanned by those vectors , with @xmath36 being the in - plane component and @xmath37 the normal component .",
    "it follows that by driving the @xmath38 = 0 transition with a perfectly linear polarized field , the electric - quadrupole coupling can be turned off by rotating the 2.051 @xmath27 m beam s polarization to an orientation where its electric field is perpendicular to the quantization axis .",
    "+ the alignment angle @xmath35 can not be distinguished well within the @xmath39 transition since , independent of the ratio of m1 to e2 , it also affects the relative size of the two rabi frequency contributions .",
    "its effect , however , is clearly discernible within the @xmath38 = @xmath40 transitions .",
    "for those there is only electric field coupling , but to both the @xmath41 and @xmath42 components of the laser s field .",

    "( [ eq : omega2 ] ) hold true regardless of the 2.051 @xmath27 m polarization state . because the m1 coupling is so small relative to the e2 coupling , distortions to the driving field polarization state are a leading systematic concern . in practice",
    "we have found that the small amounts of ellipticity induced from birefringence of the optical viewport leading into the trapping apparatus are significant and must be accounted for in the analysis .",
    "single ions were trapped inside a linear paul trap , described in @xcite , with @xmath24440 khz axial and @xmath241 mhz radial trapping frequencies .",
    "micromotion was compensated for by means of a disk electrode beneath the trap and a rod electrode parallel to the trap axis . a small hole bored through the center of the disk electrode allowed neutral barium flux to reach the trap from an oven below .",

    "shelving was accomplished by means of a home built 455 nm ecdl . because of the strength of the transition it was convenient to operate the 455 nm laser multi - mode , which enabled us to drive the shelving transition without active wavelength stabilization . using this scheme",
    "we were able to reach the shelved state in under 5 ms , which was limited by the speed of that system s mechanical shutter . to remove the ion from the shelved state we used a frequency - doubled 1228 nm beam producing a beam at 614 nm .",
    "the free running stability of that laser was sufficient that it , too , did not require stabilization against an optical resonator .",
    "+ the 6s@xmath48 5d@xmath6 transitions , which contain the m1 moment of interest , were excited using a diode pumped solid - state ( tmho : ylf ) laser operated at 2.051 @xmath27 m @xcite .",
    "the laser was stabilized against an ultra - low expansion optical resonator that was measured to have a finesse greater than 350,000 @xcite . because of the availability of optical coatings at the time of its construction , to achieve such a high finesse cavity it was necessary to stabilize it against the beam s second harmonic at 1.025 @xmath27 m .",
    "of the 40 mw of 2.051@xmath27 m light available , only 3 mw were delivered to the ion for spectroscopy , while the rest was used for stabilization . at the time of writing",

    "the 2.051 @xmath27 m transitions were separated by about 3 mhz by the zeeman effect , and were typically power broadened to between tens of kilohertz to tens of hertz , depending on the field alignment . to roughly locate the transitions we used adiabatic rapid passage ( arp ) @xcite .",
    "examples of two arp scans , corresponding to starting with the atom prepared in either of its @xmath0 ground states , are shown in fig .",

    "all eight 2.051 @xmath27 m transitions are evident , and are labeled by their corresponding change in the magnetic quantum number .",
    "to obtain all of the necessary pieces needed to get m1 , three measurements were undertaken ; first of @xmath54 , then @xmath55 alone , then @xmath56 measured simultaneously .",

    "( [ fig.samplerabiflop ] ) .",
    "the first two rabi oscillation data sets were used to calculate m1 without correcting for 2.051 @xmath27 m ellipticity , and the @xmath57 data were used to extract the viewport birefringence parameters to account for ellipticity in the beam . in all cases the rabi frequency measurements were taken at 10@xmath58 intervals of half - wave plate rotation , except near the minimum of @xmath54 , where more data was needed . the half - wave plate position was set manually using a thorlabs prm1 high - precision rotation mount , which had an angular resolution of five arc - minutes read off a vernier scale .",
    "all rabi frequency measurements were recorded with respect to the reading of the half - wave plate s rotation mount which were assigned a @xmath43 10 arc - minute ( 0.16@xmath58 ) error bar to over - estimate error from vernier acuity .",
    "the rotation was always carried out from low angle to high angle to avoid inconsistency from backlash .",
    "we did not know _ a priori _ how the half - wave plate was oriented in its rotation mount ( with respect to the plane spanned by the 2.051 @xmath27 m @xmath59 vector and the ion s quantization axis ) , so in all cases the data were fit with an additional phase offset @xmath60 to account for this initial alignment .",

    ", the principle effect of the viewport in the @xmath62 data is to raise the minimum value observed , @xmath63 , without significantly skewing its position .",
    "the consequence of these observations is that , to a good approximation , @xmath54 is , @xmath64 the parameter @xmath63 includes the m1 coupling plus some e2 coupling due to unintended elliptical polarization that can be subtracted out if the viewport parameters are known . in the data we were unable to properly resolve @xmath63 because of the system s decoherence , and",
    "for that reason what we report here is an upper limit on m1 . to get that limit (",
    "first , without the ellipticity correction ) we need the alignment angle between the 2.051 @xmath27 m laser and the ion s quantization axis @xmath35 which we get from the stand - alone measurement of @xmath55 . + the angle",
    "@xmath35 is a fit parameter to that data and determines the amplitude of the oscillation observed @xmath61 .",
    "the effect of ellipticity in the beam s polarization is to skew the data both vertically and horizontally which shifts @xmath35 s apparent value , however that effect contributes minimally to our final m1 value . and",
    "so to obtain @xmath35 we approximate the laser fields as linearly polarized , which leads to , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is @xmath67 .",
    "once we have the viewport parameters we can correct @xmath35 to get closer to the true value , where we will find about a 1@xmath58 shift . that withstanding , m1 is not particularly sensitive to @xmath35 , at least for our chosen geometry , so this correction is not critical for the experiment s interpretation .",
    "an important indicator that our approximations are valid is that the data sets remain well - aligned , indicated at the fitted values of @xmath60 agreement to a few hundredths of a degree for the two transitions .",

    "by performing a polarization - based spectroscopy of the 6s@xmath48 5d@xmath6 transitions in ba@xmath2 we have placed an upper bound on those transition s magnetic - dipole moment .",
    "in the course of doing so we have also demonstrated how our technique can be used to measure stress - induced birefringence in ultra - high vacuum viewports .",
    "several pathways for improvement exist for a next - generation of this experiment . to improve the ability to resolve @xmath68 efforts are underway to reduce our measurement s decoherence rate , which was in majority set by ambient magnetic field noise .",
    "this could be mitigated with the implementation of magnetic shielding .",
    "a complementary strategy would be to enlarge @xmath68 by delivering more 2@xmath27 m light to the ion . also , as our measurement has shown , ellipticity can be leveraged - if sufficiently well calibrated - to enhance the size of @xmath68",
    ". this approach could be improved by eliminating stress - birefringence from the system and introducing a large but known amount of ellipticity separately .",
