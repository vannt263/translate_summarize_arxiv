    "+ since we expect the hadronic contribution to disappear , at least at some point above @xmath0 , we included effects of finite - volume particles to effectively suppresses the hadronic degrees of freedom , when deconfinement is achieved . including these effects in a thermodynamic model for hadronic matter ,",
    "was proposed some time ago @xcite .",
    "we will use an ansatz similar to that in @xcite , but modify it to also treat the point like quark degrees of freedom consistently .",

    "we will couple the polyakov loop to the dilaton in the following way : @xmath64 assuming a hard part for the dilaton field which essentially stays unchanged and a soft part , which vanishes when deconfinement is realized .",

    "the lattice results on the other hand quickly reach a value that is expected for a non - interacting gas of quarks , even right above @xmath0 .",
    "this is in fact surprising as other thermodynamic quantities tend to favor a picture with a wide region around @xmath0 where interactions are strong .",
    "this behavior was also reproduced by the pnjl model and the qh model while both fail to describe the fast increase in @xmath74 right above @xmath0 .",
    "+ next we try to disentangle the hadronic contribution to the second coefficient .",
    "as can be seen in figure ( [ qhmc2 ] ) the dependence on the strength of the repulsive interaction below @xmath0 is rather small and one can not exclude any scenario . in the crossover region , around @xmath0 ,",
    "differences become obvious .",
    "+ the solid black line in figure ( [ qhmc2 ] ) displays the result for @xmath74 using the standard parametrization of the qh model as described in @xcite without any repulsive quark - quark interactions .",
    "the value of @xmath74 only slowly approaches 1 , which is mainly due to the fact that the value of the chiral condensate drops to 0 rather slow in our model and therefore the quark masses do not decrease as fast as in the pnjl approach .",
    "+ including repulsive vector interactions for the quarks gives a result which is similar to the one obtained from the pnjl ( red dashed line ) . here",
    "the repulsive interactions strongly decrease the value of @xmath74 .",
    "+ turning off all repulsive interactions , vector interactions for quarks and hadrons as well as the excluded volume corrections ( orange dash dot dotted line ) , leads to an drastic overestimation of @xmath74 .",
    "this is expected as all hadronic degrees of freedom are present at and above @xmath0 if the excluded volume effects are turned off .",
    "therefore one largely overestimates the effective degrees of freedom .",
    "+ on the other hand if the repulsive vector interactions are turned on only for the hadrons one obtains a rather good description of the lattice results ( blue dash dotted line ) . in this parametrization",
    "the hadrons are also still present in the system up to arbitrary high temperatures , as the excluded volume effects are still turned of , and therefore all thermodynamic quantities are largely over predicted . + to remove the hadronic contributions from the system we introduced excluded volume corrections as described above .",
    "this leads to a pronounced dip in @xmath74 above @xmath0 ( green dotted line ) , indicating that our excluded volume approach is either to simplified or all hadronic contributions are already vanishing completely right above @xmath0 or that the lattice results are still not accurate enough to sufficiently resolve effects of hadron hadron interactions .",

    "non interacting quarks , without any hadronic contribution , gives the only reasonable description of the data already slightly above @xmath0 .",
    "while the height of the peak does depend on the strength of the vector coupling , we observe also a strong dependence on the slope of the change of the order parameters around @xmath0 , which is larger in the qh model as compared to the pnjl model .",
    "notice that the parametrization shown as the blue dash - dotted line , which gave the best description for @xmath74 , overestimates @xmath75 around @xmath0 drastically .",
    "this is simply because all thermodynamic quantities are over predicted in this case and therefore the densities as well as the order parameters increase steeper as they do in the lattice calculations .",
    "we have compared results for the quark number susceptibilities at @xmath3 obtained from two mean field models to recent results from lattice calculations .",
    "both models strongly indicate that the eos of qcd above @xmath0 seems to be composed purely of a gas of non - interacting quasi particles .",
    "this finding is in agreement with recent work by @xcite where the extracted quark vector coupling strength approaches zero very fast around @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "lattice observables like the interaction measure and the normalized polyakov loop indicate a large region above the critical temperature where the hot qcd medium is far from being an ideal gas .",
    "around @xmath0 repulsive hadronic interactions are supported by our results with the qh model . to describe the steep increase of @xmath74 around",
    "@xmath0 we need to introduce hadronic contributions up to right above @xmath0 . at even larger temperature",
    "the hadrons seem to be replaced by a almost non interacting gas of quarks .",
    "this offers an intriguing implication concerning the cep . in mean field studies with the pnjl @xcite as well as in the hq model @xcite ,",
    "a general feature of including repulsive interactions is that the cep is moved to larger chemical potentials or even disappears completely . from this point of view",
    ", a vanishing quark vector interaction would favor the existence of a cep .",
    "+ on the other hand , the phase structure of qcd up to @xmath0 and likely even slightly above it could be determined by hadronic interactions . in model calculations without any repulsive quark interactions the quarks often appear at rather small chemical potentials ( at @xmath76 ) making a reasonable description of the nuclear ground state difficult .",
    "a repulsive hadronic vector interaction , which is required on order to reproduce the properties of a saturated nuclear ground state , may move the cep to larger chemical potentials or even remove it completely from the phase diagram in accordance to mean - field results @xcite .",
