    "ckm phases explain all observed cp violations .",
    "however , baryogenesis apparently requires more cp - violation than is provided for by the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "thus physics beyond sm should contain new source of cp violation that is somehow small enough not to be in conflict with experiment .",
    "cp violation from new physics can manifest itself in several ways .",
    "one way is by measuring an electric dipole moment ( edm ) of a fermion .",
    "no edm has been found to date .",
    "the current experimental electron edm ( eedm ) bound is @xmath4 at @xmath5 cl @xcite , which already puts a strong constraint on physics beyond the sm . in supersymmetric theories  @xcite ,",
    "the eedm induced at one - loop is usually larger than this bound so we need several assumptions @xcite or cancellation mechanisms @xcite to avoid this limit for a wide range of parameter space .",
    "cp violation can also be seen in cp asymmetries of particle energy - momentum distributions at colliders .",
    "one such cp asymmetric collider observable was proposed recently using the interference effect between cp conserving and violating @xmath6 interactions in the diboson production processes at lhc  @xcite .",
    "this observable may be able to improve collider sensitivities on cp violating couplings such as triple boson vertices ( tbv ) by up to two orders of magnitude from the most recent lep results .",
    "since we expect that abundant diboson production will occur at lhc , and they have clean tri - lepton decay signals , this observable is useful to probe new physics at the lhc .",
    "this improvement raises the hope of discovery , and it is worthwhile studying the possible reach of both the collider observable and edm measurements in more detail .",
    "intuition holds in the physics community that edms are the most powerful probes of new physics contributions to flavor - preserving cp violation . that intuition is largely based on the varieties of supersymmetric theories that have dipole moments induced at the one - loop level",
    "however , given the possibility of the lhc increasing the probing sensitivity by a few orders of magnitude , we investigate how solid that intuition is within the context of theories that have suppressed one - loop contributions to edms .",
    "our primary example is supersymmetry with heavy sfermion masses .",
    "ultimately , we shall not disagree that edms are unlikely to be supplanted by the lhc in the search for new sources of cp violation .",
    "we detail the path to that strengthened conclusion below .",
    "diboson production channels at the lhc are described in fig .",
    "[ diboson : lhc ] using the low - energy effective theory below the electroweak scale .",
    "this effective theory is obtained by integrating out heavy particles in physics beyond the sm .",
    "the modified sm interactions which now contain both cp - even and odd interactions are represented as small blobs in the figure .",
    "one can see from the figure that we should study the diboson production channels at the lhc , involving triple boson vertices ( tbv ) @xmath7 and couplings with fermions @xmath8 .",
    "we will focus only on tbv among them .",
    "one reason for this is that we can easily extend our work to include fermion couplings without changing the conclusions .",
    "secondly , cp - odd effective couplings are mediated by particles in the bsm and are loop suppressed .",
    "any charged particle couples to the vector bosons , whereas only a small number of particles couple to a specific fermion typically . therefore , tbv is more generally present than more direct cp - violating couplings with fermions .",
    "in addition , large cp - odd @xmath9 couplings with @xmath10 can induce an edm without loop - suppression , as is discussed in section  [ sec : edm ] .",
    "since other @xmath9 couplings are presumably related with the @xmath11 coupling in an underlying theory , it is difficult to avoid the experimental edm limit with large cp - odd @xmath9 couplings .",
    "thus , a meaningful analysis can be carried out with tbv only .",
    "the effective lagrangian of cp - odd tbv is  @xcite _ & = & ig_wwv ( _ v w^+_w_^ + w^+ _ w^_^ _ + g_4^v w^+_w_(^v^+ ^v^ ) ) + & & + ( g_h_iww _ i^w ^ w^+ _ + g_h_izz ^ z _ ) h_i [ cpodd : wwv ] where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the ratio of cp - even @xmath14 coupling to sm @xmath14 coupling .",

    "@xmath21 is c - odd while others are p - odd , so @xmath21 is not relevant for our work as discussed in section  [ sec : coll ] .",
    "higher dimensional operators are suppressed by the electroweak scale @xmath22 .",
    "higgs couplings to photons and gluons can also be written in the same way .",
    "these effective couplings are actually momentum dependent .",
    "however , we can reasonably choose to study constant on - shell couplings as argued in appendix a.    it is useful to know the @xmath23 invariant dimension - six operators that generate the effective triple gauge couplings in eq.([cpodd : wwv ] ) after electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 generate @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is generated by @xmath28 which does not involve higgs fields .",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 here are full field strengths .",
    "cp - odd neutral @xmath31 couplings are not generated by these operators . as couplings with photons and couplings with @xmath17 bosons",
    "are presumably related in an underlying theory , we shall reduce redundancy and give results in terms of the @xmath17 boson coupling only .",
    "cp asymmetries at colliders are observables well - known to probe cp violating interactions  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that if absorptive sm backgrounds are known well the lhc may be sensitive to @xmath32 coupling perhaps as low as the @xmath33 with @xmath34 , which would be a significant improvement over lep2 capabilities , for example  @xcite .",
    "this sensitivity was achieved based on the fact that the cross section proportional to the @xmath35 tensor is a signal of the cp violation since the tensor is odd under time reversal .",
    "thus , only @xmath36 and @xmath37 odd couplings in eq .",
    "( [ cpodd : wwv ] ) are potentially able to be probed with this precision .",
    "although no equivalent small value has been estimated for @xmath38 , we shall suggest by analogy to @xmath39 that it may be possible .",
    "the @xmath40-odd coupling @xmath21 can be probed in other ways and will not be treated in this paper .",
    "cp violating higgs couplings can also be probed at the lhc in the same way , in principle .",
    "several other collider observables sensitive to higgs couplings have been studied as well based on the angular distributions of final leptons .",
    "the sensitivities on the cp violating @xmath41 coupling are usually expected to be around @xmath42 with @xmath43 of data from the process @xmath44 at lhc , and possibly @xmath45 from higgsstrahlung at a future @xmath46 linear collider  @xcite . as we study edm sensitivities to the cp violating couplings involving the higgs boson , we compare results to the @xmath47 lhc expected sensitivity .",
    "one and two - loop order generation of edms are shown in fig .",
    "[ edm : one - two ] using the effective theory .",
    "cp - odd effective couplings in the effective theory are represented as small blobs in the figure . since",
    "effective cp - odd couplings are generated at loop order , the tree - level diagram on the right - hand side implies a one - loop contribution to the edm and others are two - loop contributions .",
    "we want to avoid one - loop induced edm in our study .",
    "the first reason for this is that a one - loop induced edm is usually larger than experimental bounds in many models .",
    "secondly , we want to give a  one loop advantage \" to collider observables  we expect that tbvs are generated at one - loop order , which only then enables edms at two - loop order .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , one - loop edm ( first diagram ) corresponds to cp - odd @xmath9 couplings with @xmath10 and on - shell external particles .",
    "the suppression of the one - loop induced edm roughly implies the smallness of cp - odd @xmath9 couplings , and vice versa .",
    "then the two - loop diagrams in the first line of fig .  [ edm : one - two ] are also suppressed .",
    "we will consider only two - loop contributions in the second line of fig .",
    "[ edm : one - two ] with specified insertions of effective couplings .",
    "we note that these effective interactions are cp violating tbvs that were necessary for the diboson production process as discussed in sec  [ sec : tbv ] . at two - loop order",
    ", @xmath48 and scalar - vector can transmit cp violation to sm fermions , whereas scalar - scalar mediation is very small due to small yukawa couplings .",
    "only @xmath48 can mediate cp - violation without higgs bosons because there is no cp - odd triple neutral electroweak boson couplings .",
    "edms are generated only through these cp violating tbvs as long as we ignore quartic and higher effective couplings .",
    "it can also be inferred that edms and cp violating tbvs depend on the same cp phases as will be discussed in sec  [ sec : cpphase ] .",
    "the electric dipole operator should be rg evolved from high scale down to the fermion mass scale at which the fermion edm is defined .",
    "renormalization group flow mixes this operator with other operators with the same quantum numbers such as chromo - electric dipole , three - gluon weinberg operator  @xcite and @xmath49 analogies of these . for electron edm ( eedm ) ,",
    "not all are relevant since the electron is colorless .",
    "the remaining @xmath49 operators are relatively suppressed by multiple powers of @xmath50 and the qed renormalization effects are smaller than qcd .",
    "we will not consider renormalization effects for eedm .",
    "in this paper we focus on the electron edm since the experimental measurements are excellent and improving , and the theory computation has minimal theoretical uncertainty .",
    "of course , one expects a high degree of correlation of one edm to other edms in most theories of physics beyond the sm , and later we shall briefly study the correlation of electron edm and neutron edm .",
    "as stated earlier , the current sensitivity limit on the eedm is @xmath4 at @xmath5 cl  @xcite . upon surveying the literature",
    ", one expects that the future eedm sensitivity of the near - term future experiments to be approximately @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "when appropriate , we shall use these numbers as benchmark sensitivities in the numerical discussion ahead .",
    "now we work on specific supersymmetric models . in trying to find scenarios where the lhc can probe better the new cp violating physics compared to eedm measurements",
    ", we will work on models in which the eedm is two - loop suppressed while tbv is only one - loop suppressed . as the simplest possibility we study the split supersymmetry limit where all scalars except sm - like neutral higgs are heavy and decoupled  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to take only first two generations of sleptons and squarks to be heavy , allow cp violating couplings in the trilinear scalar vertices of the third generation , which induces radiative breaking of cp invariance in the higgs sector .",
    "the mixing of cp even and cp odd eigenstates in the higgs sector gives opportunity to colliders to discover these new sources of cp violation .",
    "one can see the relevance of tbvs in supersymmetric models in a more useful way using the physical cp - phases .",
    "using @xmath52 and peccei - quinn ( @xmath53 ) symmetries , it is shown that in any phase conventions there are two sets of physical cp - phases in the universality ansatz  @xcite : arg(@xmath54 ) , arg(@xmath55 ) , where parameters are the usual soft supersymmetry parameters and higgsino mass @xmath56 .",
    "the arg(@xmath57 ) are also allowed by the same argument . since we impose gut - like relations on gaugino masses these phases are not relevant to consider .",
    "as low - energy effective operators composed of sm dirac fermions and vector fields are neutral under @xmath52 and @xmath53 symmetries , we can argue that low - energy physical observables should depend on the above combinations , which are the only @xmath52 and @xmath53 invariants .",
    "indeed , both @xmath52 and @xmath53 are needed and enough for us to do that because all complex soft phases are charged under at least one of them .",
    "this argument does not restrict soft squark / slepton masses .",
    "since the @xmath58 term appears only in the higgs sector , cp violation in the soft supersymmetry breaking sector can be transferred to low - energy effective operators consisting of higgs bosons at one - loop order .",
    "possible cp violating interactions with one sm higgs field are higgs - vector - vector , higgs - fermion - fermion and higgs - scalar - scalar couplings .",
    "higgs - higgs - vector coupling is usually related to the higgs - vector - vector via the underlying theory .",
    "as sizable tree - level processes at lhc involve at most two higgs bosons , the scalar quartic coupling is not relevant .    as discussed in section [ sec : tbv ] , there are also @xmath59 invariant dimension - six operators composed of higgs bosons and vectors . after the higgs bosons get vacuum expectation values , these operators can induce effective triple gauge couplings @xmath60 , where @xmath15 is a neutral vector boson .",
    "thus cp violating tbvs are not only relevant but also can indeed be generated at one - loop order in supersymmetric models .",
    "it is also clear that cp violating tbvs and edms depend on the same cp phases .",
    "the split sfermion / ino limit of supersymmetry ( split supersymmetry ) does not naturally induce large edms . in this limit , charginos and neutralinos",
    "are not decoupled , and they carry cp phases in the soft supersymmetry breaking sectors . these ino sectors couple to sm fermions at tree - level only via ino - fermion - sfermion couplings which lead to suppressed amplitudes in split supersymmetry due to the heavy sfermions .",
    "so cp violation in the sm fermion sector , e.g. edm , are induced beginning at two - loop order .",
    "recent studies have shown that the electron edm turns out to be generically smaller than or around the current limit in most of parameter space even with maximum cp - phases  @xcite .    to compute the effects , the input parameters are @xmath61 and their phases , @xmath62 and sm - like neutral higgs mass @xmath63 .",
    "the sign of @xmath56 is not relevant as it just shifts the cp - phase by @xmath64 .",
    "since we are interested in electron electric dipole moments , the gluino mass @xmath65 is not relevant .",
    "once we assume gut - like relation between gaugino masses , only one cp - phase @xmath66 is physical .",
    "the phase of @xmath58 is related to the relative phase of @xmath67 and @xmath68 via the minimization condition of the higgs potential ; @xmath69 is real at tree - level .",
    "we will work in the basis in which @xmath58 is real , then the two higgs bosons have opposite phases .",
    "@xmath70 rotations of @xmath67 and @xmath68 can remove this relative phase , and the higgs boson vevs are real in the same basis  @xcite .",
    "the only physical combination of cp - phases remaining is @xmath71 .",
    "it is clear that these cp - phases reside in the chargino and neutralino sectors .",
    "edms in split supersymmetry have been computed in previous works  @xcite .",
    "we also compute the effective cp - odd tbvs generated by diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ tbv : split](a ) , and apply them to the eedm and collider observables .",
    "we give supporting analytic results in the appendix .     and",
    "neutralinos @xmath72 .",
    "similar diagrams generating @xmath73 couplings can also be drawn .",
    "( b ) diagram that is responsible for the @xmath27 coupling is shown in terms of current eigenstates .",
    "gaugino @xmath74 is running in the loop , and its complex soft mass insertion is denoted as a cross . a similar diagram in which higgsinos are running with mass @xmath56 insertions can also be drawn.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    one interesting result to notice is that the @xmath27 coupling is not generated at one loop .",
    "it is simply because this coupling is generated by a dimension - six operator that does not involve higgs fields as discussed in section  [ sec : tbv ] , whereas the physical cp phase depends on the @xmath58 term .",
    "we can see this more explicitly in terms of current eigenstates depicted in fig .",
    "[ tbv : split](b ) . as higgs - higgsino - gaugino coupling couples gaugino and higgsino , either a gaugino or a higgsino runs in the loop without higgs .",
    "then @xmath56 , as an interaction between @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and @xmath77 can not appear together , and hence no cp - phase .",
    "( recall that the physical phases are @xmath78 in our basis . ) indeed , the diagram with only gaugino ( or higgsino ) is proportional to @xmath79 ( or @xmath80 ) because of the charge flow direction as shown in the figure .",
    "these are real , i.e. , no cp violation .",
    "both cp - violating tbvs and eedm are approximately proportional to @xmath81 by essentially the same reason . to see this it is again easiest to think in terms of current eigenstates .",
    "relevant diagrams are then fig .",
    "[ tbv : split](b ) with the @xmath82 boson on top replaced by a neutral gauge boson , and with mass insertions replaced by external @xmath83 legs and their vevs .",
    "note that we need one @xmath67 and one @xmath68 in order to insert both @xmath84 and @xmath56 . as we take neutral higgs fields other than sm - like higgs boson to be very heavy , we obtain a simple relation between higgs mixing angle @xmath85 and vev ratio @xmath86 : @xmath87 at leading order .",
    "therefore , each vev of @xmath67 and @xmath68 carries @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively , hence @xmath81 overall .",

    "eedm and cp violating tbvs depend on input parameters quite similarly .",
    "@xmath62 dependence cancels when we study the relative importance of eedm and collider observables as we saw above .",
    "heavy @xmath63 can suppress the eedm since higgs boson mediated two - loop eedm dominates numerically in this scenario , while tbvs are independent of @xmath63 .",
    "however , due to the narrow consistent higgs mass range @xmath90 of the light sm - like higgs boson in supersymmetry , this suppression is not very significant .",
    "@xmath91 dependence is weak since the bino does not couple to gauge bosons at tree - level .",

    "<S> cp violation from physics beyond the standard model may reside in triple boson vertices of the electroweak theory . </S>",
    "<S> we review the effective theory description and discuss how cp violating contributions to these vertices might be discerned by electric dipole moments ( edm ) or diboson production at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . despite triple boson cp violating interactions entering edms only at the two - loop level , we find that edm experiments are generally more powerful than the diboson processes . </S>",
    "<S> to give example to these general considerations we perform the comparison between edms and collider observables within supersymmetric theories that have heavy sfermions , such that substantive edms at the one - loop level are disallowed . </S>",
