    "there is a growing interest in techniques for non - perturbative and non - equilibrium quantum field theories .",
    "potential applications for new methods range from cold atoms to cosmology ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recent progress on topics such as the dynamics of non - equilibrium critical points and phase transitions has come from the development of @xmath7-particle irreducible effective action ( @xmath7piea ; @xmath8 ) methods .",
    "these methods have a long history .",
    "the 1piea was introduced by goldstone , salam and weinberg @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the 2piea was introduced independently by several authors @xcite and finally received its modern formulation by cornwall , jackiw and tomboulis @xcite .",
    "this method has seen widespread use in both condensed matter and fundamental physics ( see , e.g. @xcite for fairly recent reviews ) .",
    "@xcite then realized that these were special cases of a general formalism for arbitrary @xmath7 .",
    "this work was then extended by others @xcite , but the practical use of effective actions for @xmath9 remains minimal , largely due to difficulties with the renormalization of physically interesting theories .",
    "@xmath7pieas can be thought of as generalizations of mean field theory which are ( a ) elegant , ( b ) general , ( c ) in principle exact , and ( d ) have been promoted for their applicability to non - equilibrium situations ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein for extensive discussion of all these points ) .",
    "non - perturbative methods are essential in non - equilibrium qft because secular terms ( i.e. terms which grow without bound over time ) in the time evolution equations invalidate perturbation theory .",
    "@xmath7pieas with @xmath10 achieve the required non - perturbative resummation in a manifestly self - consistent way which can be derived from first principles .",
    "`` in principle exact '' here means that the @xmath7piea equations of motion are exactly equivalent to the original non - perturbative definition of the quantum field theory .",
    "the only necessary approximation is in the numerical solution of these equations .",
    "the resulting equations of motion are also useful in equilibrium because many - body effects are included self - consistently .",
    "`` general '' means that the methods are applicable in principle to any quantum field theory whatsoever ( although in a theory with many fields or with large @xmath7 the resulting @xmath7piea could be very bulky ) .",
    "finally , `` elegant '' here means that few conceptually new elements are needed in the formulation of @xmath7pieas in addition to the usual terms of textbook quantum field theory .",
    "the complication is mainly of a technical , not conceptual , nature . to our knowledge",
    "no other techniques satisfy all of these criteria .",
    "@xmath7piea methods work by recasting perturbation theory as a variational method . instead of working with standard feynman diagrams built from bare propagators and vertices , one works with a reduced set of feynman diagrams built from the _ exact _ mean field @xmath11 , propagators @xmath12 and vertex functions @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "these quantities are determined by solving equations of motion @xmath15 etc .",
    "the @xmath16 functionals are themselves built from @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and so on .",
    "the @xmath16 and accompanying equations of motion are exactly equivalent to the original quantum field theory , but are sensitive to physical effects which are invisible to perturbation theory .",
    "furthermore , this ability to capture non - perturbative physics is competitive with or exceeds other standard resummation methods such as borel - pad summation , at least in a toy model where exact solutions are available as a benchmark @xcite .",
    "an unfortunate practical difficulty faced by would - be users of @xmath7pieas is that , once truncated to finite order , solutions of the equations of motion derived from @xmath17 no longer obey the expected symmetry properties ( i.e. ward identities or wis ) which are obeyed by the exact solution , even if the truncation is manifestly invariant .",
    "this occurs simply because there is no guarantee that the pattern of partial resummations encoded in an approximation to @xmath16 will respect the order by order cancellations required to fully maintain the wis .",
    "the most obvious effect of this is that goldstone bosons are unphysically massive and the symmetry breaking phase transition is incorrectly predicted in models of spontaneous symmetry breaking treated within the hartree - fock approximation ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the use of higher order truncations can cure this problem but more subtle symmetry violating effects still occur .",
    "similar remarks apply for gauge theories , where an unphysical gauge dependence remains in quantities that should be physical .",
    "several methods have been advocated in the literature to combat this problem , though none are without flaws .",
    "for example , the widely used external propagator method @xcite is not fully self - consistent : _",
    "after _ the variational solution is found , `` external '' correlation functions are constructed which _ do _ satisfy the the wis",
    ". however , the incorrect variational solutions are still the ones used in the self - consistent step . as a result ,",
    "more subtle problems such as violations of unitarity persist . @xcite introduced a promising method called symmetry improvement ( si ) , which imposes the wis directly as constraints on the solution through lagrange multipliers .",
    "si has been applied with some success with the si-2piea @xcite and extended to the si-3piea @xcite , however the method is inconsistent out of equilibrium ( at least at the linear response level ) @xcite and sometimes solutions fail to exist due to the constraint causing a renormalization group defying coupling between short and long distance physics @xcite . considering that the symptom in both cases is the non - existence of solutions , and that the constraint in the si method is singular and requires some careful treatment to begin with , it is reasonable to suspect that the culprit may be that the method is over - constraining .",
    "this motivates the investigation of whether it is possible to generalize the si method and at the same time allow the solutions more freedom .",
    "that is what this paper does .",
    "we introduce a new method which we call _ soft symmetry improvement _ ( ssi ) which relaxes the constraint . violations of wis are allowed but punished in the solution of the ssi-@xmath7piea .",
    "the method is essentially a least - squares implementation of the symmetry improvement idea .",
    "a new parameter , the stiffness @xmath0 , controls the strength of the constraint .",
    "the method interpolates between the unimproved ( @xmath1 ) and si ( @xmath2 ) cases and the hope is that practically useful solutions can be found for finite @xmath0 .",
    "we study the ssi-2piea for a scalar @xmath3 model in the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "we find that the method is ir sensitive : the system must be formulated in finite volume @xmath4 and temperature @xmath5 and the @xmath6 limit must be taken carefully .",
    "three distinct limits exist .",
    "two are equivalent to the unimproved 2piea and si-2piea respectively , and the third is a new limit where the wi is satisfied but the phase transition is strongly first order and solutions can fail to exist depending on @xmath0 .",
    "further , these limits are disconnected from each other ; there is no smooth way to interpolate from one to another .",
    "these results suggest that any potential advantages of ssi methods ( and any consideration of ( s)si out of equilibrium ) _ must occur in finite volume_.    the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "following this introduction , section [ sec : soft - symmetry - improvement ] introduces the ssi formalism .",
    "then , in section [ sec : renormalisation - of - hf ] the ssi-2piea is renormalized in the hartree - fock approximation at finite @xmath18 .",
    "solutions are then found in section [ sec : solution - in - the - infinite - volume - limit ] with careful consideration of the various @xmath6 limits .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the notation agrees with our previous papers @xcite except where noted .",
    "in particular , the dewitt summation convention is used , i.e. sums over repeated indices imply integrations over corresponding spacetime arguments .",
    "the soft symmetry improved 2piea is a modification of the 2piea defined for theories with an internal symmetry . in order to have a concrete example we use the @xmath3 symmetric scalar @xmath19 theory discussed in our previous papers @xcite .",
    "we will focus on the spontaneous symmetry breaking regime where the field has a non - zero expectation value @xmath20 , a `` higgs '' boson with mass @xmath21 and @xmath22 massless goldstone bosons .",
    "the definition of the ssi-2piea can be motivated by starting with the standard 2piea @xmath23 $ ] ( suppressing indices and spacetime arguments where these just clutter ) and the trivial identity @xmath24\\right)=\\int\\mathcal{d}\\phi\\ \\delta\\left(\\phi-\\varphi\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\gamma\\left[\\phi,\\delta\\right]\\right).\\ ] ] the usual symmetry improved action @xmath25 $ ] is then obtained by inserting a delta function @xmath26\\right ) & = n\\int\\mathcal{d}\\phi\\ \\delta\\left(\\phi-\\varphi\\right)\\nonumber \\\\   & \\times\\exp\\left(\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\gamma\\left[\\phi,\\delta\\right]\\right)\\delta\\left(\\mathcal{w}\\left[\\phi,\\delta\\right]\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the ward identity is @xcite @xmath27\\equiv\\delta_{ab}^{-1}t_{bc}^{a}\\phi_{c},\\ ] ] ( @xmath28 is a generator of the @xmath3 symmetry ) and the normalization factor @xmath29 is chosen so that @xmath25 $ ] numerically equals @xmath23 $ ] when the arguments satisfy the ward identity.^{-1}$ ] though it is not necessary to worry about rigorously defining this here . also note that if one wants invariance under redefinition of @xmath30 then one also needs to insert a factor of @xmath31 .",

    "however , this is not necessary here because we will not consider transformations of @xmath30 . ]",
    "@xmath25 $ ] is defined only for field configurations satisfying the ward identity , and equals the usual effective action on those configurations .",
    "thus @xmath25 $ ] is nothing but the si-2piea introduced by @xcite , arrived at in a new way .",
    "proceeding from the hypothesis that the problems with symmetry improvement are due to strict imposition of the constraint , as embodied by the delta function above , we introduce a _ soft symmetry improved _ ( ssi ) effective action @xmath32 $ ] where the ward identity is no longer strictly enforced .",
    "small violations @xmath33 are allowed but punished in the functional integral . a new free",
    "parameter controls how strictly the constraint is enforced .",
    "the hope is that the added freedom allows consistent solutions with non - trivial dynamics ( e.g. linear response to external sources ) , while the stiffness can be tuned to make violations of the ward identity acceptably small in practice . to achieve this",

    "the method is essentially a least - squares implementation of the symmetry improvement idea .",

    "we studied the ssi-2piea for a scalar @xmath3 model in the hartree - fock approximation and found that the method is ir sensitive .",
    "the system must be formulated in finite volume @xmath4 and temperature @xmath5 and the @xmath6 limit taken carefully .",

    "the symmetric phase is the same and is unmodified from either the unimproved 2piea or si-2piea methods .",

    "two of the limits are equivalent to the unimproved 2piea and si-2piea respectively .",
    "the third is a new limit where @xmath346 is taken to be fixed and finite as @xmath6 . in this limit",
    "the wi is satisfied but the phase transition is strongly first order and strongly dependent on the scaled stiffness @xmath218 .",
    "also , the upper spinodal temperature decreases as @xmath218 decreases and , for @xmath256 , solutions fail to exist between the upper spinodal temperature and the critical temperature . for @xmath262 ,",
    "the upper spinodal temperature is equal to zero and broken phase solutions cease to exist entirely .",
    "the limit was studied in both the leading large @xmath29 limit and in perturbation theory in @xmath233 .",
    "the large @xmath29 limit is trivial to leading order and the perturbation theory does not exist since the ssi term is singular at the unimproved solution .",
    "these results all suggest that the new limit is pathological .",
    "the results of this paper are primarily restricted by the use of the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "investigations of higher order approximations are motivated but would be far more involved , numerically , than anything attempted here .",
    "it is possible that a higher order truncation could ameliorate some or all of the problems with ssi found here .",
    "however , assuming the hartree - fock results hold true , we can summarize the findings as follows : we have found a method which subsumes both the unimproved 2piea and si-2piea and contains a new dynamical limit as @xmath6 .",
    "however , these limits are disconnected from each other ; there is no smooth way to interpolate from one to another .",
    "further , each limit is in one way or other pathological .",
    "these results suggest that any potential advantages of ssi methods ( and likely any consideration of ( s)si out of equilibrium ) _ must occur in finite volume_. whether this is possible or not depends on the particular system being studied .",
    "thus , ultimately , symmetry improvement methods can not be trusted as a `` black box '' : their validity must be decided on a case by case basis .",
