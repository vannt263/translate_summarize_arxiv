    "construction will begin soon on the american laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) @xcite , and on its french / italian counterpart , virgo @xcite .",
    "early in the next century there will likely be in operation a worldwide network of detectors , with sites in america , europe , and possibly japan and australia @xcite .",
    "it is important at this stage for physicists to look ahead and identify the types of science that the community might focus on using this network when it reaches a mature stage , perhaps a decade after the first gravitational waves are detected .",
    "one of the reasons for doing so is that some properties and parameters of the network , which ultimately will constrain what it can accomplish in the future , are being finalized today .",
    "the orientation of the detector arms is one example .",
    "one of the long term aims of this detector network will be to place upper limits on ( or perhaps detect ) the energy density of a stochastic background ( sb ) of gravitational waves . this background would be analogous to the relic @xmath8 electromagnetic background , except that its spectrum is not expected to be thermal .",
    "the spectrum is usually characterized by a quantity @xmath9 which is the gravitational - wave energy density per unit logarithmic frequency , divided by the critical energy density @xmath10 to close the universe : @xmath11 some possible sources of a sb include : ( i ) random superposition of many weak signals from binary - star systems @xcite , ( ii ) decaying cosmic strings@xcite and first order phase transitions@xcite in the early universe , and ( iii ) parametric amplification of quantum mechanical zero - point fluctuations in the metric tensor during inflation @xcite .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews .",
    "the predicted wave strengths from all of these stochastic sources are highly uncertain , reflecting our relative ignorance of the relevant physics and/or astrophysics .",
    "hence , detecting or placing upper limits on the sb can bring us valuable information , particularly about the very early universe .",
    "relic gravitational waves produced during inflation are particularly interesting , because , as grischuk has shown @xcite , the energy spectrum for these waves contains a unique imprint of the time evolution of the universe s scale factor @xmath12 .",
    "we now discuss what is known about the magnitude of the contribution to @xmath9 from these waves , at frequencies relevant to ligo / virgo .",
    "the predictions for @xmath13 from cosmological models are not very firm : they can vary between @xmath14 and @xmath15 or less",
    ". however , observational upper bounds on @xmath9 in various frequency bands give interesting constraints on the models @xcite . in turn",
    "these constraints can be used , within the context of particular inflation models , to place upper bounds on the contribution of relic gravitons to the value of @xmath9 in the ligo / virgo waveband , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the strongest such upper bound comes from matching the normalization of the scalar and tensor fluctuations produced during inflation to the recent cobe measurement of the microwave background anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the result of this matching is somewhat discouraging : standard exponential inflation models predict that @xmath16 at the @xmath17 confidence level @xcite , far too small to be detected [ cf .",
    ".  @xmath18 below ] .",
    "while it is far from certain that exponential inflation is correct , it seems unlikely that the expansion during the inflationary era was so much faster than exponential as to tilt the gravitational wave spectrum enough to give a detectable signal at high , ligo / virgo frequencies .",
    "it is also possible , of course , that the observed microwave anisotropy was caused by physical processes of structure formation other than inflation .    despite these pessimistic prospects for the detection of relic gravitons by ligo / virgo ,",
    "it is certainly possible that there will be a detectable signal from other sources such as cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "hence , it is important to determine how the detector arm orientations , which will not be changeable in the future , affect the sensitivity of the detector network to the sb .",
    "to do so is the first of the two principal purposes of this paper .",
    "this issue was first considered by michelson @xcite , and has been extensively discussed by christensen @xcite .",
    "essentially we build on and extend slightly their analyses .",
    "our conclusions are also slightly different from those of christensen .",
    "the second principal purpose of this paper is to spell out the optimal data - processing procedure for searching for the sb with a network of detectors .",
    "the algorithm for two detectors is implicit in michelson @xcite ( and is incorrectly treated in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; we give a more detailed description and a generalization to a network of detectors , taking into account the possible effect of correlated sources of noise .",
    "we now turn to a description of our results and an explanation of how they relate to earlier work .",
    "the effect of the sb on a gravitational - wave detector is essentially to produce a small contribution to the random , gaussian noise in its output . for one detector",
    "this contribution will be swamped by the detector s own sources of noise , unless the sb strength is implausibly large ( @xmath19 ; see sec .",
    "[ correlations ] ) . for two detectors which have no common sources of noise ,",
    "however , the only contribution to the correlated fluctuations in the detector outputs will be the sb . by cross correlating the outputs of the detectors , the sb can in principle",
    "be measured .",
    "if one had identical , ligo type detectors at the same site , oriented in same way so that they respond in exactly the same way to the sb , and with levels of intrinsic noise corresponding to the `` advanced detectors '' of ref .",
    "@xcite , then cross correlating would give a sensitivity to @xmath13 of the order of @xmath20 in the frequency band @xmath21 @xcite .    for a pair of separated ,",
    "non - aligned detectors , two new physical effects complicate the analysis @xcite .",
    "first , if the detectors are not aligned the same way , they will respond to different polarization components of the sb .",
    "orthogonal polarization components of the sb are expected to be statistically independent , and so the cross correlation will be reduced .",
    "second , for each mode there will be a time lag between exciting the first detector and the second detector , and hence phase lags in the cross correlation . for the ligo detectors separated by @xmath22 and having maximum sensitivity at a frequency of @xmath23 , a typical phase lag will be of order unity",
    "hence , there will be some destructive interference between parts of the cross - correlation that are due to modes which propagate in different directions .",
    "thus we expect a reduction in the sensitivity of the detector pair to the sb .    to analyze this reduction , it is necessary to ( i ) determine how to _ optimally process _ the output from the detectors , and ( ii ) find the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) that results from this method of filtering .",
    "we also want to ( iii ) determine how the optimal snr depends on the detector orientations , and ( iv ) find those orientations that maximize the snr . steps ( i ) and ( ii ) were analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite . they found that , when optimal signal processing is used , the square of the signal to noise ratio for a broadband measurement of the sb is@xcite @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the duration of the measurement , and @xmath26 is the spectral noise density in either detector .",
    "the key quantity appearing in this equation is the dimensionless function @xmath27 , which we call the _ overlap reduction function_. it characterizes the reduction in sensitivity to the sb of the detector pair at frequency @xmath28 that is due to their separation and non - optimal orientations , and its value is unity for coincident , aligned detectors . in refs .",
    "@xcite a formula for the overlap reduction function was derived , which expresses it as an integral over all solid angles of the complex phase lag between the detectors , weighted by combinations of the detector beam pattern functions [ cf .",
    ".  @xmath29 below ] .",
    "christensen@xcite numerically calculated this function for various detector configurations and discussed some of its properties .",
    "however its dependence on the detector orientations was not apparent .",
    "in this paper we derive an analytic formula for the overlap reduction function . using this formula we are able to carry through steps ( iii ) and ( iv ) outlined above .",
    "we also determine how good are the choices that have been made for the orientations of the detectors in ligo , virgo and geo ( an as - yet - unfunded british / german collaboration ) ; i.e. , we determine how their sensitivity to the sb compares to the sensitivity they would have if they were optimally oriented .",
    "our results are as follows .",
    "call @xmath30 the angle between the bisector of the arms of the first detector and the arc of the great circle that joins the detectors , and similarly define @xmath31 for the second detector .",
    "let @xmath32 and @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 describes the relative rotation of the detector pair , and @xmath35 describes their average rotation with respect to the line joining them .",
    "then in sec .",
    "[ optimization ] below we show that the optimum snr @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 where the quantities @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are independent of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and @xmath38 and @xmath40 are positive .",
    "there are thus two possibilities for the optimum detector orientation , depending on the sign of @xmath39 : ( i ) @xmath41 , corresponding to each detector having an arm along the line joining them , and ( ii ) @xmath42 , corresponding to each detector arm being at an angle of @xmath1 ( mod @xmath2 ) to this line . in fig .",
    "[ beta ] we plot the snr for both of these choices of orientation , as a function of the angle @xmath43 subtended between the detectors at the center of the earth .",
    "the configuration ii is optimal for @xmath44 , while configuration i is optimal for detectors which are further apart .",
    "[ beta ] shows that detectors which are close together are the most sensitive ; the sensitivity of ligo is roughly @xmath45 of what it would be if its detectors were coincident .",
    "it also shows that detectors whose planes are roughly perpendicular ( @xmath46 ) have poor sensitivity , as we would expect .",
    "we also show in sec .",
    "[ optimization ] that the narrowband sensitivity of the detector pair near a given frequency @xmath28 , which is proportional to @xmath47 , is also always optimized at either configuration i or ii .",
    "for example , at very low frequencies , @xmath47 becomes essentially the overlap of the polarization tensors of the two detectors [ cf .",
    "( [ general_result ] ) below with @xmath48 , which is maximized in configuration i. this low frequency limit was previously derived by christensen @xcite .",
    "motivated by this , he suggested that configuration i was always the best orientation to choose .",
    "[ beta ] shows that , though this is not true for some values of the separation angle @xmath43 , the amount lost by choosing i rather than ii is never more than a few percent in snr .",
    "we now discuss the orientations that have been chosen for the detector systems that are under construction or that have been proposed .",
    "the relative rotation angle @xmath34 for a pair of detectors essentially determines whether the detectors respond to different polarization components , or to the same polarization component , of the gravitational wave field .",
    "the advantage in responding to different components ( @xmath49 ) is that more information can be extracted from incoming burst signals . on the other hand ,",
    "if the detectors respond to the same component ( @xmath50 ) then the detection signal to noise threshold is reduced , i.e.  the fact that the same waveform is seen in both detectors means that one can be more confident that a candidate event is not due to detector noise .",
    "these considerations guided the choices of the presently planned values of @xmath34 for the detector pairs ligo / ligo ( there will be two ligo detectors ) and virgo / geo , which are @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively @xcite .",
    "within the context of these constraints , a key issue that we wanted to understand was the following : given the above values of @xmath34 , how much does the broadband sensitivity of the detector pair depend on @xmath35 , i.e.  by how much can the snr be reduced if @xmath35 is chosen arbitrarily instead of being optimally chosen . the answer we obtain [ secs .",
    "[ gamma_sec ] and [ optimization ] below ] is that for relatively close detectors with @xmath53 , the dependence on @xmath35 is very weak ; but the dependence is strong for detectors on different continents .",
    "hence for ligo s parallel detectors , the sensitivity will be close to optimal irrespective of the value of @xmath35 ; the present choice of @xmath54 implies that the snr for ligo is @xmath55 of the sensitivity at optimal orientation .",
    "the virgo / geo orthogonal detector pair , however , will have a snr of less than @xmath56 times the optimal value , irrespective of the value of @xmath35 , if @xmath57 is chosen to be @xmath1 ( as is planned , so as to optimize the information obtainable from burst sources ) .    finally , we estimate the @xmath58 upper confidence limit that can be placed on @xmath9 by the so called `` advanced detectors '' in ligo @xcite , in a broadband measurement using a one third of a year integration time , to be @xmath59 in the frequency band @xmath60 [ cf .",

    "one takes advantage of the fact that the sources of noise in each detector will be independent",
    ". this will be the case for detectors at widely separated sites , because sources of noise that are correlated between the detectors on timescales of the order of the light travel time between them are expected to be insignificant , or if not they can be monitored and compensated for @xcite .",
    "when correlated noise is unimportant , then the off - diagonal elements of @xmath117 will be very small , so that @xmath129 by measuring these components we can gain information about the sb .",
    "one does this by cross correlating the two output streams @xcite .",

    "one first constructs the correlation with time delay @xmath137 , @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the observation time , typically of the order of a year .",

    ", this smearing of the cross - correlation compensates in some measure for the phase lags between the detectors which were discussed in sec .  [ intro ] .",
    "the quantity @xmath143 will then have a truncated gaussian distribution ( i.e. gaussian but restricted to positive values ) with signal to noise ratio given by eq .",
    "@xmath36 @xcite .",

    "we now relax this assumption and consider the effects of correlated noise .",
    "it is planned for ligo / virgo to ultimately have two or three detectors per detector site , perhaps optimized for different types of gravitational wave sources .",
    "thus , there will be two possible types of correlation measurements : _ intrasite _ measurements at one site , and _",
    "measurements between detectors at different sites .",
    "as previously mentioned , it seems very unlikely that there will be any significant correlated noise in intersite measurements , and so it will only be important for intrasite measurements .",

    "hence , the upper bound ( [ win_factor1 ] ) will be much worse than the bound ( [ win_factor ] ) obtained from intersite correlations .",
    "we also consider the assumption that the correlated detector noise always excite different detectors in phase , but can be arbitrarily large in magnitude , so that @xmath164 in this case intrasite correlation measurements can not be used to _ detect _ the sb , but can only be used to place upper bounds on its magnitude . the resulting upper limit [ cf .",

    "<S> we build on and extend the recent work of christensen , but our conclusion for the optimal choice of orientations of a pair of detectors differs from his . for a pair of detectors ( such as ligo ) that subtends an angle at the center of the earth of @xmath0 , we find that the optimal configuration is for each detector to have its arms make an angle of @xmath1 ( modulo @xmath2 ) with the arc of the great circle that joins them . for detectors that are farther separated , each detector should instead have one arm aligned with this arc . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the broadband sensitivity to the stochastic background of a detector pair which are @xmath3 apart is essentially determined by their relative rotation . </S>",
    "<S> their average rotation with respect to the arc joining them is unimportant . </S>",
    "<S> we also describe in detail the optimal data - analysis algorithm for searching for the stochastic background with a detector network , which is implicit in earlier work of michelson </S>",
    "<S> . the ligo pair of detectors will be separated by @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum detectable stochastic energy - density for these detectors with their currently planned orientations is @xmath5 greater than what it would be if the orientations were optimal , and @xmath6 times what it would be if their separation were @xmath7 a few kilometers . [ </S>",
    "<S> the detectors are chosen to be far apart so that their sources of noise will be uncorrelated , and in order to improve the angular resolution of the determinations of positions of burst sources . ]    </S>",
