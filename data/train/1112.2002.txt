    "this paper considers the inverse problem of determining an isotropic electrical conductivity @xmath4 from one measurement of the magnitude of the current density field @xmath0 generated inside the domain @xmath5 while imposing the voltage @xmath6 at the boundary . extending the existing work",
    ", the problem here allows for some perfectly conducting and insulating inclusions be embedded in @xmath5 away from the boundary .",
    "the domain @xmath7 , @xmath8 , is assumed bounded , open and with a connected lipschitz boundary .",
    "the problem considered in this paper is modelled by two physical principles : the maxwell model of the electromagnetic field at very low frequency , and a magnetic resonance technique to image current densities pioneered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "employment of dual physical models is a fairly new trend in quantitative imaging which seeks better accuracy and resolution of the reconstructed images , compared to the methods based on just one physical principle .",
    "for recent progress in such hybrid imaging methods in conductivity imaging we refer to @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the review articles @xcite and @xcite",
    ".    inspired by @xcite and @xcite , two subclasses of conductivity imaging methods have been developed : the ones which use interior knowledge of the current density field , and the ones that use the measurement of only one component of the magnetic field , known as magnetic resonance electric impedance tomography ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite for work in this direction ) .",
    "the problem considered here belongs to the former subclass .",
    "the idea of using the current density field to image electrical conductivity appeared first in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a perturbation method recovered the conductivity in the linearized case .",
    "using the fact that @xmath9 is normal to equipotential lines , the method in @xcite recovered two dimensional isotropic conductivities . in @xcite",
    "the problem is reduced to the neumann problem for the 1-laplacian , and the examples of non - uniqueness and non - existence for this degenerate elliptic problem show that knowledge of the applied current at the boundary together with the magnitude of current density field inside is insufficient data to determine the conductivity . instead , the `` @xmath9- substitution '' algorithm based on knowledge of the magnitude of two current density fields has been proposed ; see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the idea of using two currents goes back to @xcite ; in @xcite the problem is reduced to a first order system of pdes and several numerical reconstructions based on solving this system are proposed . in independent work in @xcite , and respectively @xcite , a simple formula recovers @xmath10 at each point in a region where two transversal current density vectors have been measured ; see also @xcite for careful experimental validation of this formula .    in @xcite",
    "a reconstruction method which uses the interior knowledge of the magnitude of just one current density field @xmath0 has been proposed .",
    "this method relies on the fact that , in the absence of singularities , equipotential sets are minimal surfaces in the metric @xmath11 conformal to the euclidean metric . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the equipotential surfaces are minimizers for the area functional @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the induced euclidean surface measure .",
    "( note that @xmath14 is the area of @xmath15 in the riemannian metric @xmath16 described above . ) moreover , in @xcite it is shown that the voltage potential @xmath3 is a minimizer of the functional @xmath17 subject to @xmath18 with @xmath19 at the boundary @xmath20 , and that @xmath3 is the unique minimizer among @xmath21 with @xmath22 a.e . in @xmath5 and @xmath19 at the boundary .",
    "one can determine @xmath3 , and hence @xmath4 by a minimization algorithm . a structural stability result for the minimization of the functional in ( [ eu_lag ] )",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "formally , the euler - lagrange equation for the non - smooth functional in ( [ eu_lag ] ) is the generalized 1-laplacian .",
    "this is in contrast with the work in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , where the conductivity imaging from interior data leads to the generalized 0-laplacian .",
    "partial reconstruction from incomplete data results are available for planar domains @xcite : if @xmath0 is known throughout @xmath5 , but @xmath6 is only known on parts of the boundary .",
    "more precisely , if some interval @xmath23 of boundary voltages is twice contained in the known values of @xmath6 , then one can recover the conductivity in the subregion @xmath24 in fact @xmath0 need only be known in a subregion @xmath25 which contains regions of the type ( [ imaged ] ) for unknown values @xmath26 s and @xmath27 s .",
    "the method in @xcite determines from the data if @xmath28 contains regions of the type ( [ imaged ] ) , and , if so , recovers all the ( maximal ) intervals @xmath23 , their corresponding @xmath29 and the conductivity therein .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in imaging an isotropic conductivity @xmath4 from the magnitude of one current density field in the presence of perfectly conducting and insulating inclusions .",
    "we shall prove that the conductivity outside the inclusions , and the shape and position of the perfectly conducting and insulating inclusions are uniquely determined ( except in an exceptional case , see remark [ rem1 ] ) by the magnitude of the current generated by imposing a given boundary voltage .",
    "we also establish a connection between the above problem and the uniqueness of the minimizers of weighted least gradient problem @xmath1 with @xmath2 .    unlike the results in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite that have been proven under the assumption that the interior data @xmath30 a.e . in @xmath5 ,",
    "the results presented in this paper allow for @xmath31 in open subsets of @xmath5 .",
    "in the following section we present and discuss our main results .",
    "let @xmath32 be an open subset of @xmath5 with @xmath33 to model the _ perfectly conducting inclusions _",
    ", @xmath34 be an open subset of @xmath5 with @xmath35 to model the _ insulating inclusions _ , and let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be their corresponding characteristic functions .",
    "note that @xmath32 and @xmath34 may have more than one connected component .",
    "we assume @xmath38 , @xmath39 is connected , and the boundaries @xmath40 , @xmath41 are piecewise @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath43 , and @xmath44 be bounded away from zero .",
    "for @xmath45 consider the conductivity problem @xmath46    the perfectly conducting inclusions occur in the limiting case @xmath47 .",
    "the limiting solution is the unique solution to the problem : @xmath48 ( see the appendix for more details ) , where @xmath49 is a partition of @xmath32 into connected components .",
    "for lipschitz continuous conductivities in any dimension @xmath50 , or for essentially bounded conductivities in two dimensions , the solutions of the conductivity equation satisfy the unique continuation property ( see , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "consequently the insulated ( and possibly perfectly conducting ) inclusions are the only open sets on which the interior data @xmath0 vanishes identically .",
    "however , in three dimensions or higher it is possible to have a hlder continuous @xmath4 and boundary data @xmath6 that yield @xmath51 in a proper open subset @xmath52 , see @xcite .",
    "we call such regions @xmath53 _ singular inclusions_. on the other hand ohm s law need not hold inside perfect conductors : the current @xmath9 inside perfectly conducting inclusions @xmath32 is not necessarily zero while @xmath54 in @xmath32 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    the measured data for our inverse problem is the non - negative function @xmath55 in @xmath5 , the magnitude of the current density field @xmath9 induced by imposing a voltage @xmath6 at the boundary @xmath56 .",
    "we have @xmath57 . in the perfectly conducting inclusion @xmath32",
    "we will not rely on the ohm s law ; we will use the condition ( [ perfect - cond ] ) and the transmission condition @xmath58 across the boundary of @xmath40 ( see the appendix ) .",
    "indeed we have found an extension of the notion admissibility of @xcite which will be crucial in allowing us to treat the case of perfectly conducting and insulating inclusions considered here . in a different direction , this also makes it possible to extend results on uniqueness of minimizers of weighted least gradient problems as discussed later in this section .    to formulate our results , we first need to introduce a notion of _",

    "we have added condition ( iii ) for technical reasons .",
    "even though it is not always satisfied , this condition is very general , at least for physical applications .    on the other hand if @xmath84 then @xmath85 is not invariant under adding or subtracting constant and therefore @xmath86 thus we have the following proposition about condition ( [ perfect - cond ] ) .",
