    "the excitations of the quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) heisenberg antiferromagnets systems have been studied extensively since haldane predicted an energy gap in the excitation spectra of the isotropic _ integer_-spin heisenberg chains in 1983 @xcite .",
    "now it is well established that there is an energy gap separating the singlet ground state from the triplet lowest - energy - excitation states for the _ integer_-spin heisenberg chains , contrast to the gapless excitation states of the _ half - odd - integer_-spin heisenberg systems @xcite .",
    "this theoretical prediction has been confirmed by buyers _",
    "et al _ @xcite in the inelastic - neutron - scattering experiments on the quasi-1d antiferromangetic compound csnicl@xmath0 .",
    "some subsequent experimental investigations @xcite and numerical calculations @xcite also support haldane s prediction .    at very low temperature ,",
    "most of the quasi-1d antiferromagnetic materials including csnicl@xmath0 show the three - dimensional nature with the classical magnetic order , and more interestingly , energy gaps at the magnetic wavevector have also been observed in many compounds @xcite . for the case of csnicl@xmath0 ,",
    "the observed energy gap was initially explained by a uniaxial single - ion anisotropy but now it is widely accepted that the gapped excited state belongs to one of the two longitudinal modes corresponding to the oscillations in the magnitude of the magnetic order of the quasi-1d hexagonal systems , first proposed by affleck based on a simplified version of haldane s theory @xcite .",
    "the gapped longitudinal modes are clearly beyond the conventional spin - wave theory which produces only the transverse excitations usually referred to as magnons . a later experimental study by enderle _",
    "@xcite using high - resolution polarized neutron scattering also confirms affleck s proposal of the longitudinal modes , and contradicts the spin - wave theory of two - magnon by ohyama and shiba @xcite or a modified spin - wave theory by plumer and caill @xcite .",
    "there are also investigations of the longitudinal excitation states in other quasi-1d structures with the nel - like long - ranged order at low temperature such as the tetragonal kcuf@xmath1 with @xmath2 @xcite , where good agreements between the experiment and a theory based on a sine - gordon field theory have been found for the energy gap at the magnetic wavevector @xcite .",

    "we recently proposed a general microscopic many - body theory based on the magnon - density waves for the longitudinal excitations of spin-@xmath3 quantum antiferromagnetic systems @xcite .",
    "in analogy to feynmann s theory of the low - lying excited states in the helium-4 superfluid @xcite , we identify the longitudinal excitation states in a quantum antiferromagnet with a nel - like order as the collective modes of the magnon - density waves . in application to the quasi-1d tetragonal structure of kcuf@xmath1 with @xmath2 , with no other fitting parameters than the nearest - neighbor coupling constants in the model hamiltonian , we find that our numerical results for the energy gap values at the magnetic wavevector are in general agreement with the experiments @xcite .",
    "we hope that more experimental results for the energy spectra at other wavevectors will be available for comparison .    in this article , we extend our microscopic approach to the quasi-1d hexagonal quantum antiferromagnets such as csnicl@xmath1 and rbnicl@xmath1 @xcite both with spin-1 and csmni@xmath1 with spin-5/2 @xcite .",

    "the basal planes of these materials are antieferromagnetic triangular lattice with the noncollinear magnetic order .",
    "hence there are two possible longitudinal modes in these hexagonal systems , rather than the single longitudinal mode of the bipartite systems such as the tetragonal kcuf@xmath1 .",

    "iii , using the approximated ground state from the spin - wave theory .",
    "the energy gaps due to the anisotropy and the energy gaps of the longitudinal modes without anisotropy are then discussed in details .",
    "we compare our results for the longitudinal energy gaps with the experimental results for the spin-1 compounds csnicl@xmath0 and rbnicl@xmath0 and the spin-5/2 compound csmni@xmath4 .",
    "we find good agreements for the energy gap values for csnicl@xmath0 and rbnicl@xmath0 after including the higher - order contributions in our calculations . for csmni@xmath4 which is very close to the pure 1d system we find a big discrepancy between our approximation of the gap value and the experimental results .",

    "<S> we investigate the excited states of the quasi - one - dimensional quantum antiferromagnets on hexagonal lattices , including the longitudinal modes based on the magnon - density waves . </S>",
    "<S> a model hamiltonian with a uniaxial single - ion anisotropy is first studied by a spin - wave theory based on the one - boson method ; the ground state thus obtained is employed for the study of the longitudinal modes . </S>",
    "<S> the full energy spectra of both the transverse modes ( i.e. , magnons ) and the longitudinal modes are obtained as functions of the nearest - neighbor coupling and the anisotropy constants . </S>",
    "<S> we have found two longitudinal modes due to the non - collinear nature of the triangular antiferromagnetic order , similar to that of the phenomenological field theory approach by affleck . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation energy gaps due to the anisotropy and the energy gaps of the longitudinal modes without anisotropy are then investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we then compare our results for the longitudinal energy gaps at the magnetic wavevectors with the experimental results for several antiferromagnetic compounds with both integer and non - integer spin quantum numbers , and we find good agreement after the higher - order contributions are included in our calculations .    </S>",
