    "let @xmath7 be any simple finite undirected graph without loop . in 1991",
    "yannakakis @xcite asked for the existence of a compact extended formulation of the stable set polytope of @xmath7 , i.e. , the existence of a simpler polytope in higher dimension whose projection is the stable set polytope of @xmath7 ( the stable set polytope @xmath8 is the convex hull in @xmath9 of the characteristic vectors of all the stable sets of @xmath7 ) .",
    "such a simpler polytope would correspond to a linear program with extra variables to solve the maximum weighted stable set problem in @xmath7 . however , there is no good explicit description of the stable set polytope for general graphs .",
    "consequently , yannakakis considered this problem in restricted classes of graphs on which a description of the stable set polytope with equalities and inequalities is known .",
    "this is the case for perfect graphs : the stable set polytope is exactly the polytope described by the clique inequalities ( @xmath10 , for every clique @xmath11 ) together with the non - negativity constraints .",
    "this case highlights a combinatorial object which provides a combinatorial lower bound ( the so - called _ rectangle covering bound _ ) for the size of any extended formulation for @xmath8 .",
    "yannakakis then raised the question below for both perfect graphs and general graphs .",
    "we state this question in its graph - theoretical version but it can also be stated as a communication complexity problem . in a graph @xmath7 ,",
    "a _ cut _ is a partition @xmath12 of @xmath13 into two subsets .",
    "given two disjoint subsets of vertices @xmath1 and @xmath2 , a cut @xmath14 _ separates _ @xmath1 and @xmath2 if @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "a _ clique - stable set separator ( cs - separator ) _ is a family @xmath0 of cuts such that , for every clique @xmath1 and every stable set @xmath2 with @xmath3 , there is a member of @xmath0 that separates @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the _ size _ of a cs - separator is the number of cuts contained in the family .",
    "yannakakis s question is the following : @xmath15 yannakakis proved in  @xcite that every graph on @xmath16 vertices admits a cs - separator of size @xmath17 .",
    "he also proved that the existence of a polynomial - size cs - separator is a necessary condition for the existence of a polynomial ( more frequently called _ compact _ ) extended formulation of the stable set polytope .",
    "the existence or not , for every graph @xmath7 , of a polynomial - size cs - separator and/or a compact extended formulation for @xmath8 has been a big open question since 1991 ; see e.g.  lovsz s survey @xcite . it has seen a renewed interest since 2012 with the following two results :",
    "on the one hand , fiorini  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proved that some graphs do not admit a compact extended formulation for @xmath8 ; on the other hand , huang and sudakov @xcite proved the first superlinear lower bound for the size of a cs - separator in general .",
    "this lower bound was then improved in @xcite and then in @xcite . eventually , gs @xcite proved in 2015 that some graphs do not admit a polynomial - size cs - separator .",
    "hence , yannakakis s two questions have been finally given a negative answer in the general case .",
    "however , determining which graph classes admit a polynomial cs - separator remains a widely open problem .",
    "a class @xmath0 of graphs is said to _ have the polynomial cs - separation property _ if there exists a polynomial @xmath18 such that every graph @xmath19 admits a cs - separator of size @xmath20 .",
    "we further say that @xmath0 has the @xmath21-cs - separation property if @xmath22 is a @xmath21 in the previous definition .    given a family of graphs @xmath23 , a graph @xmath7 is _ @xmath23-free _ if no induced subgraph of @xmath7 is isomorphic to a member of @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath23 is composed of only one element @xmath24 , we say that @xmath7 is @xmath24-free .",
    "it is easy to see that when the number of maximal cliques , or the number of maximal stable sets , is a polynomial in the size of the graph , then there exists a polynomial - size cs - separator . in particular",
    ", this happens when @xmath25 or @xmath26 is bounded by a constant , and by @xcite , this also happens for @xmath27-free graphs .",
    "concerning subclasses of perfect graphs , yannakakis @xcite proved that comparability graphs and chordal graphs have the polynomial cs - separator property , and they even have compact extended formulations . since a cs - separator of the complement graph",
    "can be trivially obtained from a cs - separator of the graph , the polynomial cs - separation property also holds for the complements of comparability graphs and complements of chordal graphs .",
    "moreover , lagoutte et al .",
    "@xcite proved that perfect graphs with no balanced skew - partition have the quadratic cs - separation property .",
    "leaving the domain of perfect graphs , yannakakis proved that @xmath28-perfect graphs have the polynomial cs - separation property , and even that they have compact extended formulations for the stable set polytope .",
    "bousquet et al .",
    "@xcite showed that , asymptotically almost surely , there exists a polynomial size cs - separator for @xmath7 if @xmath7 is picked at random .",
    "furthermore , they showed that @xmath29-free graphs , where @xmath29 is any split graph ( i.e. , a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and a stable set ) , @xmath30-free graphs , and ( @xmath31)-free graphs ( where @xmath32 denotes the path on @xmath33 vertices and @xmath34 its complement ) all satisfy the polynomial cs - separation property .",

    "to this end , we define in section  [ sec : tree ] the general setting of a decomposition tree and highlight in section  [ sec : validdec ] some decomposition rules that behave well with respect to cs - separators .",
