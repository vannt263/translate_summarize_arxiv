    "interestingly , such a simple equation has to the best of our knowledge no known analytical solution . while the coupling can give rise to a complicated dynamics  @xcite ,",
    "when the diffusion is small and in the linear regime , the phenomenology is simply that of two fields beating at the rabi frequency . in our experiments ,",

    "in our configuration , where the space dynamics plays no substantial role , it can be averaged over to retain only the key variables that capture the dynamics , namely : @xmath64 in which case the dynamics becomes that of two coupled quantum harmonic oscillators , with commutation relation @xmath65=1 $ ] for both  @xmath66 , and hamiltonian ( at resonance ) : @xmath67",
    "while the dynamics of two linearly coupled oscillators is extremely simple from a classical perspective , it can become tricky when shifting to the quantum point of view .",
    "in addition to the various patterns of oscillations , just as in the classical case , one has to consider the plethora of quantum states that can set them in motion ( or not , in cases of eigenstate superpositions ) .",
    "already for pure states , the wavefunction needs an infinite set of complex coefficients  @xmath68 to be fully specified , say in the basis of fock states  @xmath69 with @xmath70 quanta of excitations in oscillator  @xmath0 and  @xmath71 in oscillator  @xmath1 , since : @xmath72    while as much information is necessary to describe genuinely quantum states  @xcite , most of it is redundant for those that have a classical counterpart .",
    "for instance , coherent states can be reduced to two complex numbers only : @xmath73    this is essentially the case of our experiment since the system is excited resonantly by a laser pulse , that creates a coherent state , and it is found a - posteriori by the analysis that dephasing has a small effect given the large populations involved and the short duration of the experiment , resulting in states that remain essentially fully coherent throughout ( cf",

    ". this is the key physics at play in our experiment , and we now consider it in more details .",
    "a first important clarification in the light of a recently published proposal  @xcite is that the state that is created following such an excitation is a factorizable product of coherent states of the type  ( [ eq : mijun25182235cest2014 ] ) , and not a quantum superposition of `` _ _ macroscopically _ _ occupied orthogonal states '' .",
    "it is true that any fock state of polaritons is in a such quantum superposition , starting with the building blocks of one - particle states :    @xmath88    writing @xmath89 as a shortcut for  @xmath90 the pure state with @xmath70 photons and @xmath71 excitons , and @xmath91 the pure state with @xmath70 lower polaritons and @xmath71 upper polaritons .",
    "regardless of the quantum nature of these one - particle states , however , coherent superpositions of them wash out the entanglement and result in coherent states , in any basis . for instance , a coherent state of lower polaritons : @xmath92 is a product of coherent states of photons and excitons : @xmath93 it is therefore useless for actual quantum information processing , describing an essentially classical phenomenon , although it can have some value to simulate in a controlled classical environment a model qubit  @xcite .    if one leaves aside the pulse preparation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : miejun25185414cest2014 ] ) to consider directly the coherent state @xmath31 as the initial condition , the solution reads simply : @xmath94    two extreme cases are of interest :",
    "on the one hand , @xmath95 , in which case the dynamics becomes @xmath96 corresponding to the freely propagating lower@xmath97 and upper @xmath98 polariton condensates , respectively . on the other hand , for @xmath80 nonzero and  @xmath99 ( or vice versa ) : @xmath100 corresponding to rabi oscillations ( here we remind that we use such a qualification as a convenience and in accord with common usage to describe what really is normal - mode coupling oscillations ) between the two fields .",

    "the general case combines these two types of motions and results in an elliptical oscillation in phase - space , therefore with a reduced contrast of the oscillations .",
    "this is is precisely what happens in our experiment : the oscillations are not full - amplitude not because of decoherence that dephase the coupling , as in the case of genuine rabi oscillations , but because the state has a strong polaritonic component .",
    "we come back to the problem of visualizing this dynamics in section  [ sec : domjun29135759cest2014 ] , although with the solution eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mijun25182235cest2014][eq : domjun29140316cest2014 ] ) , we have provided a complete solution to the problem . before illustrating particular cases of interest , in next section , we generalize them to include the effect of dissipation .",
    "the hamiltonian is not enough to quantitatively describe a polariton experiment , that has various sources of decay .",

    "such a description is at a high abstract level but a full microscopic description would be so complex that it would be impossible without any phenomenological simplification of this type given the numerical state of the art and the basic physics that nevertheless eventually takes place .    here again , most of the information encoded in the density matrix is not - needed and the dynamics can be reduced to much fewer variables . to fit the data , since only @xmath42 is accessible experimentally , it is enough to calculate the dynamics of @xmath115 , which only requires that of @xmath45 . for the general case of two - pulses excitations ,",
    "it is therefore enough to solve numerically their coupled set of equations :    [ eq : viejun27093513cest2014 ] @xmath116    with the vacuum as initial condition , that is , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 the first , @xmath119 , and second , @xmath120 , pulse coupling to the cavity , @xmath121 , and exciton field , @xmath122 . equations  ( [ eq : viejun27093513cest2014 ] ) are those that fit all the data reported in this work . by setting to zero the second pulse , @xmath123 , we describe the case of one pulse excitation . in the case",

    "of course they agree in their region of overlap .",
    "we now discuss the problem of the visualization of the polariton dynamics . at a basic level , the problem seems innocuous enough , as it deals with oscillations , which are essentially captured by their amplitude and phase . for two fields ,",
    "this means two complex numbers , i.e. , four variables .",
    "two complex numbers can be mapped onto the bloch sphere if dropping their relative phase , which indeed can be done with no loss of generality .",

    "either the classical state of two coherent fields or the quantum state of a qubit @xmath137 , can allow for some classical simulation of a qubit , which may have some value , but can not , obviously , substitute for it in an actual quantum computer .",
    "we leave the analysis of quantum oscillations to another text  @xcite and focus here on the case of interest for the experiment .",
    "the bloch sphere representation is the most concise one , but it says nothing about the incoherent fraction . in our experiment , it turns out that the states remain highly coherent throughout , and there is no need to consider the dynamics of the incoherent part that grows due to dephasing and incoherent pumping .",
    "however , to be comprehensive , since we still need the relative phase information of both fields , and to put the current results in perspective with future ones with smaller number of particles , where more general states can be realized , we now discuss a more comprehensive picture , namely , the husimi representation  @xcite .",
    "it is given for two coherent fields by : @xmath138 and can be represented in its reduced form for each fields in two panels , juxtaposing @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",

    "3(a ) , merely replacing the point by a gaussian cloud of mean square deviation  @xmath141 and whose amplitude and phase are otherwise given by the population and phase of the oscillator .",
    "this is arguably the most convenient way to visualize the polariton dynamics of normal - mode coupling , particularly if it can be animated . in the supplementary video ` ii-rabioscillations.mp4 `  @xcite , we provide the same dynamics as fig .",

    "annihilation and return to the vacuum .",
    "this is the theoretical , ideal version of what the experiment realizes with one operation at a time , since the time - window available to us is not currently large enough to chain up various pulses .",
    "however the proof of principle has been fully demonstrated .",
    "although in our case the fitting implies that the system remains highly coherent at all times , before we turn to the details of the dynamics in this case , we contrast it with cases where dephasing plays a more important role . in fig .  [ fig : juejul10100806cest2014 ] , we show the dynamics of the system prepared in the upper polariton state ( which is the state that suffers the most from dephasing ) for three different balancing of the total dephasing rate  @xmath39 given by eq .",

    ", the impact would not be significant on the timescales involved . to keep the discussion as simple as possible ,",
    "we consider upper polariton dephasing only and as initial condition , coherent states of upper polaritons or of photons , each with 3 particles at  @xmath142 .",
    "one can see how the breakdown of polariton dephasing into radiative decay and pure dephasing results in different evolution of the quantum state , although the coherent fraction ( solid line ) remains the same , being dependent only on the total dephasing rate  ( [ eq : lunjun30100400cest2014 ] ) . only in the case where there is some level of pure dephasing do the two cases differ .",
    "compare in particular the first and third columns , where the polaritons are either lost ( first column ) or transferred to the incoherent fraction ( third column ) . in the latter case , the population remain constant when starting as a polariton or becomes so when the polariton fraction has vanished to leave a fully incoherent mixture .",
    "the movie corresponding to the case  ( c ) in the husimi representation is provided in the supplementary material as ` iii-rabidephasing.avi `  @xcite .",
    "the gaussian cloud spreads into a ring as it rotates , corresponding to the washing out of the phase .",
    "this together with the various modes of oscillations  @xcite give a hint as to what the complete polariton dynamics look like , when adding to such dephasing also the radiative decay and rabi oscillations .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , one value of the theory is to unveil the full dynamics and gain access to variables not reachable by the experiment . in fig .",

    "this representation gives another look at the physics already discussed .",
    "in the first case , panel  ( a ) , the state is brought from an oscillating exciton - photon dynamics into a lower polariton , therefore switching - off the oscillations .",
    "the lifetime is also changed as a result . in the second case ,",
    "panel  ( b ) , the transfer is to the upper polariton instead ( a case not achieved in the experiment ) .",
    "the phenomenology is the same but with a faster decay rate . in case  ( c ) ,",
    "the oscillation is revived and carries on rabi - oscillating beyond our experimental window .",
    "this shows in particular how the upper polariton is , again , the limiting factor , although , from the fit , it appears it is easily set in motion and populated , more than the lower polariton itself .",
    "since it decays so quickly , ultimately the system is driven into a lower polariton state only , regardless of its excitation at initial time . here",
    "again , we must stress that the decay of the contrast of oscillations with time is therefore not due to dephasing , but because upper polaritons are lost at a greater rate , making the system increasingly lower - polaritonic , which is a non - oscillating state . in the last panel ,",

    "the fit is not sensitive to the exciton lifetime as long as it is very large and we have fixed it to , typical of a reservoir exciton .",

    "<S> the coupling itself is obtained from the @xmath15 rabi splitting between the lower polariton ( lp ) and upper polariton ( up ) branches . </S>",
    "<S> the power is set to excite polaritons at a low enough density , in order to maintain their bosonic properties in the linear regime .    </S>",
    "<S> both the photon - field  @xmath16 dynamics of the experiment and the complementary exciton field @xmath17 , not accessible experimentally , can be recovered by the usual polariton field equations  @xcite ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> supplementary  @xcite ) . as expected , the exciton field forms as the photon field vanishes before it is revived as the excitations flow back from excitons into photons again . </S>",
    "<S> limiting to cases with no momentum , although the wavefunction components have a spread in both real and reciprocal spaces , the system is linear and there is no dynamics imparted by the spatial degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics can therefore be reduced to zero - dimension between two single harmonic modes , and the oscillations are fully captured through the simpler order parameters @xmath18 , accessible experimentally , and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](c ) as points , now for the full duration of the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> twelve oscillations are clearly resolved until @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , the hamiltonian is reduced to simply @xmath21 , with coupling strength  @xmath22 between the photonic mode  @xmath0 and the emitter annihilation operator  @xmath1 , both following bose algebra and at energy  @xmath23 ( resonant case ) , supplemented with @xmath24 this is the most general case of coherent and resonant excitation , with coupling to both fields and allowing for a relative phase , which is necessary to reproduce the data . </S>",
    "<S> although the excitation is an optical laser shone directly on the cavity , which is often described theoretically as a cavity - only coupling term  @xcite , it is clear on physical grounds that such a general form may be required instead , since the exciton field would still be excited without the cavity so it is natural that part of the excitation is shared between the latter and the quantum well ( qw ) . </S>",
    "<S> while it has little consequence for the single - pulse excitation , this will be crucial when dealing with coherent control by a second pulse . </S>",
    "<S> this prepares states of the type of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : marjul1094910cest2014 ] ) , i.e. , classical states that should not be confused with quantum superpositions of the type of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : lunjul21152706cest2014 ] )  @xcite , which would be extremely difficult to realize and maintain even for small values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 . regardless of the magnitude of pumping , the coherent excitation of two linearly coupled oscillators cancels completely the entanglement of the polariton fock states to produce factorizable states , in any basis . by integrating schrdinger s equation @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> , one easily finds the closed - form expression for @xmath28 and @xmath29 under the dynamics of @xmath30  @xcite . for the case of an initial state  @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath32 reduces to : @xmath33 this describes two quantum oscillators , swinging like any other of their classical counterparts , and that mixes features of the bare states ( which amplitudes oscillate ) , with those of the polaritons ( with no oscillations of their amplitudes ) . from the observation of the oscillation alone , </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore difficult to capture the true dynamics at play . </S>",
    "<S> this is where a theoretical model is needed to shed light on the hidden features  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as we are going to show , the contrast of the oscillation is not due to decoherence between the up and lp , but to a combination of the short lifetime of the up and of the effective state realized by the pulsed excitation .     and variations ( showing the envelope of the oscillations only ) when removing the effect of the exciton reservoir ( i , black dashed ) , removing the effect of polariton dephasing ( ii , dotted - dashed yellow ) and removing both ( iii , long - dashed blue ) . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the fitted values for the experiment . ]    </S>",
    "<S> while the core of the physics is contained in the wavefunction @xmath36 of the coupled oscillators under the dynamics of @xmath37 , we have to take into account dephasing and decay to describe any experiment with some degree of accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> these are mainly due to the bare state lifetimes ( with decay rates @xmath38 for the photon / exciton , respectively ) , which are also present in most light - matter coupled systems . in qw microcavities , </S>",
    "<S> additional sources of dephasing are present for the up , which is well known to be much less visible than its lp counterpart  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a contribution from the exciton reservoir has also been suggested in several works , even under coherent excitation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , no direct measurement of its contribution , nor its true nature ( coherent or incoherent ) has been clearly reported until now . </S>",
    "<S> we can address this issue by including an up dephasing rate @xmath39 and an incoherent excitonic pumping rate @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , both terms are required to reproduce the data at the level of accuracy we report . </S>",
    "<S> such terms turn the pure state wavefunction into a density matrix @xmath41 ruled by a master equation . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is standard and is given in the supplementary material  @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the complex amplitudes of the oscillators can also be derived in closed - form expressions . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental modulus square of the cavity amplitude can then be fitted by the model and other observables reconstructed from the theory . </S>",
    "<S> the fit provides an essentially perfect agreement with the data , as seen in the figures .    by shifting the laser energy to weight more on one branch than the other , as done for the series displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](a ) , different states can be prepared , that are all equally well accounted for by the theory for the same system parameters . </S>",
    "<S> note also that both the dynamics of the pulse as well as the subsequent free oscillations is described within the same model . from the theory fitting the experimental @xmath42 , we gain access to the entire dynamics of oscillations , also of the exciton field @xmath43 , but even further , of the phases @xmath44 and @xmath45 and the total excitations @xmath46 and @xmath47 and , in fact , of the full state as a whole through the density matrix @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to reconstruct the full dynamics , as done in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] for the joint exciton - photon oscillations of the experiment ( case of excitation ) , and see the effect of the various factors involved . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the impact of the reservoir is seen in the case  i ( in dashed black line , from now on plotting only the envelope of the rabi oscillations for clarity ) where it has been set to zero . </S>",
    "<S> its effect is small but is needed to reproduce the data quantitatively . </S>",
    "<S> the main detrimental actor is the up dephasing rate  @xmath39 , which , if set to zero , considerably opens the envelope of oscillations ( case ii , blue dashed - dotted line ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the incoherent reservoir extends the lifetime of the oscillations as shown in case ii and even more so in case  iii ( long dashed line ) where an higher pumping rate than that of the experiment brings the oscillations well into the nanosecond timescale , as proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , although , as already noted , this is for normal mode coupling oscillations that can not be used to engineer a qubit .    </S>",
    "<S> the coherent amplitudes of any two - level system can be mapped on the bloch sphere as @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 the azimuthal and radial angles of polar coordinates , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> such trajectories from our experiment are shown for three cases in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] , corresponding to predominant up excitation , equal weight of the branches and predominant lp excitation . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly seen in the first case how the pulse swings the coupled oscillators towards the upper state and , in all cases , how the system quickly reaches the lp . </S>",
    "<S> this is the clearest observation to date of one of the most important assumptions of microcavity polariton physics : the up is unstable and the system relaxes towards the lower branch , even though it retains strong - coupling . in the model </S>",
    "<S> , this up dephasing rate @xmath39 , could be either an escape rate ( like a lifetime due to , e.g. , scattering to high-@xmath52 exciton states ) , a pure dephasing rate , or a combination of boths , as only their sum enters in the equation of the coherent fraction . </S>",
    "<S> the result also shows that although the impinging laser is very wide in energy , it is possible to prepare the polariton condensate in a largely tunable range , from almost entirely upper - polaritonic ( at least for short times ) to almost entirely lower - polaritonic ( also the state at long - times ) , passing by purely photonic and/or excitonic , these two states constantly oscillating between each other .     </S>",
    "<S> dephasing in both time and optical phase and oscillate radially while polaritons oscillate circularly . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , they oscillate jointly and against ( resp .  @xmath53 out - of - phase with each other and with ) the rotating frame in the case of a lp ( resp .  up ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( b  e ) experimental realization ( points ) and theoretical fit ( solid curve ) of three two - pulses excitation , showing ( b ) amplification , ( c ) transition from an exciton - photon rabi oscillation to a lp and ( d ) field annihilation . ]    with such an accurate command of the system , we are able to time precisely the arrival of a second pulse and perform a comprehensive coherent control on the coupled dynamics . for a coupling of the laser to the cavity only , this would be achieved for most operations by sending the control pulse when the cavity field is empty and the condensate fully excitonic . injecting a second fully photonic pulse in optical ( resp </S>",
    "<S> .  anti - optical ) phase with the exciton , for instance , creates an up ( resp .  </S>",
    "<S> lp ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to represent such a dynamics with the joint photon and exciton fields complex phases , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](a ) for a sequence of basic operations through pulsed excitation that bring the system from ( i ) the vacuum and ( vi ) back passing by a condensate of ( ii ) photons , ( iii ) ups , ( iv ) excitons and ( v ) lps . </S>",
    "<S> the photon and exciton condensates are defined as such right after the pulse only since , not being eigenstates , they enter the oscillating regime . in the rotating frame of the bare modes at frequency  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 , the light - matter dynamics is a simple oscillation along the radius with a combined offset of @xmath54 both in time and optical phase : the cavity oscillates horizontally while the exciton oscillates vertically and when one reaches its maximum , the other is at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the lp and up condensates do not oscillate radially but circularly , since they are free modes that subtract and add , respectively , their free energy to that of the rotating frame . </S>",
    "<S> an animation of this dynamics is given in the supplementary material  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in the actual experiment , where the laser couples to both fields , one merely needs to correct for the corresponding proportions but the concept is otherwise the same . </S>",
    "<S> a first pulse triggers the rabi oscillations , since our pulse is broad in energy and always initiate a dominant photon or exciton fraction . </S>",
    "<S> however , with a second pulse , although still broad , we can refine the state by providing the complementary of the sought target . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:3](b ) shows a simple case of rabi amplification , where the same cycle is restarted by the pulse . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:3](c ) shows the case where a bare state is transformed into a lp , therefore switching off the oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> while it has not been practical with our setup to send more than two pulses , there is no fundamental difficulty in doing so and in principle one can implement all the wished steps to prepare any given state right after the pulses . </S>",
    "<S> another case of interest is complete field annihilation , by sending a pulse out - of - phase both in amplitude and in optical phase . </S>",
    "<S> this produces , by destructive interferences , the vacuum , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> all these cases demonstrate the possibility to do coherent control of the strong light - matter coupling dynamics . here too , the theory still provides an essentially perfect agreement to the data . </S>",
    "<S> similar prospects at the single - particle level would perform genuine quantum information processing , but this lies beyond the scope of this work .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we showed the tremendous control that can be obtained on the light - matter coupling in microcavities , for which we reported the first imaging of its spatio - temporal evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this allowed us to spell out with a precision never achieved before for polaritons both the excitation scheme and the various components involved in the dynamics ( dephasing , reservoirs , etc . ) </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrated the reservoir - induced lifetime enhancement recently proposed  @xcite and performed coherent control on the polariton state . </S>",
    "<S> such results are a milestone to turn these systems into devices , with future prospects such as optical gates or their single - particle counterpart now clearly in sight . </S>",
    "<S> immediate extensions suggested by this work are  beyond getting to the single - particle limit  to couple to the spatial degree of freedom with packets imparted with momentum or diffusing , and involve nonlinearities at higher pumpings .    </S>",
