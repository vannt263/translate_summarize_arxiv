    "six vertex models were introduced by slater @xcite to describe ferroelectricity in two dimensional networks . placing arrows on the bonds of a square lattice",
    "one can define the sixteen possible arrangements of arrows pointing towards and away from a lattice point as vertices . in six vertex models only those six vertex configurations are kept ( see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) that satisfy the _ ice rule _",
    ", i.e. they have two arrows pointing in and two pointing out at each vertex . assigning energies @xmath0 ,  , @xmath1 to these vertices one obtains a class of exactly solved models @xcite .",
    "six vertex models can also be interpreted as surface models , by mapping them to the so - called body centered solid on solid ( bcsos ) models @xcite , defined as limiting cases of a lattice gas , or ising model , on a body centered cubic lattice .",
    "therefore the phase structure of the six vertex model as function of its vertex weights can be translated directly to the surface phase structure of the corresponding bcsos model .",
    "the mapping turned out to be important in understanding the properties of the _ roughening transition _",
    "@xcite . using the exact solution of the six vertex model it was found that roughening is a transition of infinite order of kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) type , confirming previous renormalisation group results @xcite .",
    "experimental situations often are too complex to allow even a qualitative description by the exactly solved bcsos models .",
    "various extensions of the standard six vertex model have been proposed to deal with these cases .",
    "two main classes may be identified : one where interactions between vertices are added , and another one in which the vertex lattice is split into two sublattices with different vertex energies .",
    "these modifications , however , lead to models which , apart from some particular cases @xcite , lose the property of being exactly solvable . other techniques ( e.g. numerical ones ) have to be adopted .",
    "models in the first class have been proposed to account for further neighbour interactions between surface atoms , which may change the symmetry of the ground state and give rise to phase transitions other than the roughening transition .",
    "vertex interactions were introduced to reproduce the @xmath2 reconstruction of the ( 110 ) face of fcc noble metals like au and pt @xcite .",
    "this led to investigations on equilibrium phase transitions on these surfaces as well as on surfaces of lighter metals like ag , rh , etc ... @xcite .",
    "a model of the ( 100 ) surface of an fcc crystal exhibiting a @xmath3 reconstructed ground state @xcite has recently extended the list .",
    "the second class of models , with vertex weights alternating on the two sublattices , are known as _ staggered six vertex models_. a staggering only involving the weights of vertices 5 and 6 corresponds to the imposition of a `` staggered field '' , i.e. a field coupled to the arrow directions that changes sign between neighbouring arrows .",
    "this gives rise to an inverse roughening transition in part of the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "alternating the values for the energies of the vertices 1 , 2 and 3 , 4 on the two sublattices leads to a model known as `` the staggered six vertex model '' ( or staggered bcsos model ) in the literature .",
    "in a large part of its parameter space it can be mapped onto the ashkin - teller model @xcite . using this transformation",
    "knops investigated the phase structure of the staggered bcsos model in part of its phase diagram by renormalisation group methods @xcite , but until recently a large region of the phase diagram has remained unexplored .",
    "in this paper we present a complete account of our investigations , over the full range of parameters , of the staggered bcsos model .",
    "a preliminary description has been given already in ref .",
    "@xcite , here we present further details as well as a number of new results .    in the unexplored region of the phase diagram",
    "the model has a ground state which is twofold degenerate , therefore it has a symmetry of ising type .",
    "the twofold degeneracy is lost at a second order transition line which approaches another line of kt roughening transitions .",
    "the interplay between the two is particularly interesting , especially since a similar interplay between a kt and a second order transition has been found for several different models , among which other models for reconstructed surfaces @xcite , but also the fully frustrated xy model @xcite and coupled xy  ising models",
    "they have received a great deal of attention in recent years and till now their critical behaviour is not fully understood .",
    "the strong interplay between ising and kt degrees of freedom may lead to several possible scenarios where , in a certain region of the phase diagram , either the two transitions occur close to each other but remain separate , or they merge into a single phase transition , which may perhaps belong to a new universality class .    apart from these more theoretical aspects the model is likely to be relevant for the study of the equilibrium properties of a certain class of crystal surfaces , e.g. the ( 001 ) surface of ionic crystals of the cscl structure .",
    "this too will be discussed in some detail .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we give a description of the model . in section",
    "iii we present its full phase diagram . in section",
    "iv we review the techniques employed in our studies , i.e. the transfer matrix method and finite size scaling , and discuss the correlation functions and free energies we calculated to derive our results . in section",
    "v we discuss the critical exponents of the model and some possible scenarios for the changes in the critical behaviour along the deconstruction line . in section vi we conclude with a brief discussion of related models .",
    "the partition function of the six vertex model is given by @xmath4 where the sum runs over the set of all allowed vertex configurations @xmath5 and @xmath6 denotes the number of vertices of type @xmath7 in the configuration @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , with @xmath10 boltzmann s constant and @xmath11 the temperature ) .",
    "the model has been solved exactly @xcite for any choice of values of the energies @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) . a relatively simple choice of the vertex energies is given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 which defines , for @xmath16 , the so - called f model .",
    "the ground state is twofold degenerate and is composed of vertices 5 and 6 arranged alternatingly in a chess board configuration . the low temperature phase is usually called an  antiferroelectric \" phase , since along both horizontal and vertical rows the arrows predominantly alternate in direction . from the exact solution it is known that this system undergoes an infinite order phase transition to a disordered paraelectric state at @xmath17 .",
    "as already pointed out in the introduction , the six vertex models are isomorphic to a class of solid on solid ( sos ) models called bcsos models @xcite .",
    "microscopic configurations of an sos model are given in terms of discrete heights @xmath18 of surface atoms with respect to a reference plane .",
    "all lattice sites up to these heights are occupied and all sites above them are empty . in the bcsos model",
    "the height variables are placed on the dual lattice of the six vertex lattice .",
    "this is subdivided into an even and an odd sublattice , which are intertwined in a chess board pattern and on which the surface heights assume even respectively odd values only .",
    "the even sites will be referred to as black ( b ) sites and the odd ones as white ( w ) sites .",
    "in addition the height differences between neighbouring sites are restricted to the values @xmath19 .",
    "the mapping of six vertex configurations to corresponding configurations of a bcsos model is very simple .",
    "the height differences between neighbouring sites are put in a one - to - one correspondence with the arrow directions in the six vertex configuration .",
    "the convention is that the higher of the two surface sites is at the right side of the arrow . given a configuration of vertices , the configuration of heights is fixed uniquely once the height of a reference atom has been fixed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) .",
    "the vertex energies can be reinterpreted in terms of bond energies between the atoms . when periodic boundary conditions are applied along the ( say ) horizontal direction of the vertex lattice",
    "the number of vertices 5 and 6 per row is equal , therefore with no loss of generality one can always choose @xmath15 , fixing the point of zero energy .",
    "the vertices 5 and 6 describe local configurations in which the height variables on either diagonal are equal ( see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) .",
    "vertices 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 correspond to configurations where the height variables along either of the two diagonals are different , therefore @xmath0 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be viewed as energies needed to break a next nearest neighbour bond and produce a height difference of two vertical lattice units between neighbouring sites of equal colour .    in the ordinary bcsos model",
    "the distinction between b and w atoms has been introduced only for convenience of description , but the two sublattices are equivalent and are treated exactly on the same footing .",
    "knops @xcite extended the model to a two component system where the b and w atoms are physically different . while energy zero is still attributed to all vertices 5 and 6 ,",
    "knops assigned two different energies , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , to broken bonds between w - w and b - b atoms respectively . in terms of the six vertex representation",
    "also the vertex lattice is divided into two alternating sublattices i and ii on which the vertices assume different energies as follows :    @xmath25    this choice defines the staggered six vertex model . in the bcsos representation",
    "the model is described by the hamiltonian : @xmath26    2 subject to the constraint that the height difference between neighbouring b and w sites is @xmath19 .",
    "the first sum in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) runs over all pairs of neighbouring w sites on the surface and the second sum over the corresponding b pairs . throughout this article",
    "we will also use the parameter @xmath27 , defined by the relation @xmath28 . as mentioned already in the introduction the model defined here",
    "will be referred to as the staggered six vertex ( or bcsos ) model .",
    "obviously when @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) one recovers the usual f model .    for negative values of the vertex energies",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 , the system may model ionic crystals of bcc structure as for instance cscl @xcite .",
    "the constraint of minimal height difference between neighbouring surface sites reflects the effects of the strong attraction between oppositely charged ions , while neighbouring pairs of the same colour , having equal charges , repel each other .",
    "it is further assumed that on top of the coulombic repulsion other interactions , as for instance spin exchange , generate a slight difference in the energies for broken bonds between b - b and w - w pairs ( @xmath31 ) . in the staggered bcsos model",
    "the interaction range is limited to next nearest neighbours and to have a more realistic representation of ionic crystals one needs to extend the interactions to further neighbours .",
    "yet we expect the phase structure described here for the staggered bcsos model may be encountered in real ionic crystals .",
    "we have investigated the phase diagram of our model by means of transfer matrix and finite size scaling techniques , which will be the subject of section [ sec : numerical ] . here",
    "we present the main results .",
    "since the model shows a trivial symmetry upon exchange of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , corresponding to the replacement @xmath32 , we can restrict ourselves to the region @xmath33 .",
    "the phase diagram naturally divides into three sectors of globally different behaviour , though smoothly connected to each other .",
    "these are described in the three following subsections .      for positive values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 knops",
    "@xcite investigated the phase diagram through a mapping onto the ashkin - teller model @xcite ; the phase diagram of the latter had been obtained before by renormalisation group methods @xcite . on the @xmath34 axis the ( 001 ) surface in the corresponding bcsos model is in a flat phase for @xmath35 , whereas the interval @xmath36 represents the temperature region in which the surface is rough .",
    "the infinite order transition occurring at the kt point @xmath17 , @xmath37 corresponds to the roughening transition of this surface .",
    "roughening is a phase transition which can be characterized by the vanishing of the free energy of a _ step _ , separating two surface regions of different average height .",
    "the roughening transition results into a proliferation of steps leading to a delocalisation of the surface position and to a logarithmic divergence of the mean square height difference at large distances :    @xmath38    2 with @xmath39 the vertical lattice spacing , @xmath40 a temperature dependent prefactor , @xmath41 the distance between the lattice sites @xmath7 and @xmath42 and @xmath43 the roughening temperature . below @xmath43 ,",
    "@xmath44 saturates for large @xmath45 at a temperature dependent constant value .",
    "renormalisation group calculations @xcite show that at @xmath43 the prefactor assumes the universal value @xmath46 in the particular case of the exactly solved f model , @xmath40 is known for every temperature above @xmath43 @xcite , that is @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "in fact eqs .",
    "( [ gofr ] ) and ( [ univjump ] ) are valid not only in the high temperature phase of the f model , but also for @xmath30 ,  @xmath49 , which defines the so - called inverted f model @xcite : all along the negative @xmath34 axis the surface is in a rough state .    for @xmath50",
    "knops found two critical lines originating from the kt point and running into the regions @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the lines represent phase transitions of ising type from an ordered low temperature phase to a disordered flat ( dof ) phase , similar to the phase introduced by rommelse and den nijs @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the model is twofold degenerate . at higher temperatures the more weakly bound sublattice fluctuates above and below the more strongly bound sublattice , which remains almost localised at a given level . in the limit @xmath53",
    "the model can be mapped _",
    "exactly _ onto the two dimensional ising model , which is critical at @xmath54 ; the strong sublattice is  frozen \" to height ( say ) zero , the only freedom left for the heights of the other sublattice is to take the values @xmath19 just below or above that of the strong sublattice ( see fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ) . according to the renormalisation group results obtained for the ashkin - teller model @xcite",
    "the phase transition remains in the universality class of the two dimensional ising model all along the critical line down to @xmath55 .",
    "starting from the low temperature phase and increasing the temperature , the system undergoes an ising transition to the dof phase , while roughening is pushed up to infinite temperature @xcite .",
    "we reinvestigated this part of the phase diagram with the transfer matrix methods to be described in section [ sec : numerical ] and obtained results in full agreement with those of knops .",
    "when @xmath23 becomes negative the ground state of the system changes drastically ( irrespective of the sign of @xmath24 ) . breaking bonds between white atoms now lowers the energy , so that at zero temperature one finds the black sublattice unbroken ( provided @xmath56 ) while atoms of the white sublattice are found alternatingly above and below the black sublattice ( see fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) .",
    "this surface configuration is commonly referred to as a @xmath57 reconstructed surface . in the equivalent six vertex representation",
    "the ground state is formed by columns of vertical arrows running alternately all upwards and all downwards , and by rows of horizontal arrows running alternately all right and all left .",
    "such an arrangement of directed paths is known as a _",
    "manhattan lattice _",
    ", due to its resemblance to the one - way street pattern of manhattan . as the energy is invariant under the reversal of all arrows , the ground state is twofold degenerate , just as in the case @xmath58 . indeed in the limit @xmath59",
    "the model can be mapped _",
    "exactly _ onto an antiferromagnetic ising model leading to the value @xmath60 for the critical temperature .",
    "this constitutes a horizontal asymptote , as in the case @xmath61 , for a second order transition line , whose existence can be deduced again from the mapping of the staggered six vertex model onto the ashkin - teller model @xcite .",
    "it separates a low temperature @xmath62 ) reconstructed phase from a high temperature dof phase , where the reconstruction order is lost but the surface is still globally flat : it is the same dof phase found for @xmath61 ; no singularities are met in crossing the @xmath63-axis .",
    "our transfer matrix calculations confirm the existence of this critical line and show it exhibits ising type critical behaviour throughout sector b.      for @xmath64 the mapping of the staggered six vertex model to the ashkin - teller model leads to negative boltzmann weights in the latter .",
    "it loses its physical relevance and can not be used any more to make predictions on the phase behaviour of the staggered six vertex model . in spite of this kohmoto _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have made some conjectures , which have proven to be correct , on the physical situation beyond the  horizon \" @xmath65 .",
    "our transfer matrix analysis shows the existence of three phases : a low temperature @xmath57 reconstructed phase and a dof phase , which are present already in sector b , and a rough phase , which is found only in the present sector .",
    "two critical lines separate these phases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] : the first one is just the continuation of the second order line beyond the horizon . it still separates the @xmath57 region from the dof region and asymptotically approaches the axis @xmath66 .",
    "we have strong indications that , within at least a major part of the sector @xmath64 , this line does not belong to the ising universality class .",
    "we will present the evidence for this in section [ sec : exponents ] .",
    "the other critical line is a line of kt points separating the rough region ( or _ critical fan _ , as predicted already by kohmoto _",
    "@xcite ) from the dof region .",
    "the point where the kt line meets the vertical axis can be determined from the exact solution of the f model as the point where the prefactor of the logarithmic term in the mean square height difference is four times as large as its universal value assumed at the ordinary roughening temperature of the f model @xmath67 from which one obtains , inverting ( [ univjump ] ) : @xmath68 the factor four in ( [ factfour ] ) stems from the fact that for @xmath50 the roughening transition is driven by steps of a height of two vertical lattice units ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , due to the inequivalence between the two atomic sublattices .    a simple estimate of the roughening transition temperature based on a random walk approximation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) yields    @xmath69    this line has been drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] .",
    "indeed , for large and negative @xmath70 it is seen to run very close to the kt line , which we could determine with great accuracy by the methods described in the next section .",
    "a most remarkable feature of our phase diagram is the apparent merging of the second order and the kt line into a single line ( see fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] ) .    their horizontal distance @xmath71 as a function of @xmath70 can be well described by a curve of the form @xmath72 , with @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "this exponential fit suggests that although the two lines are coming rapidly closer together as @xmath34 is decreasing , they do never actually merge .",
    "other fits , of the form @xmath74 , which would be expected to work in the case of a merging of the lines at @xmath75 , could not be stabilised against changes in the fitting range .",
    "the apparent non - crossing of the two critical lines at first looks very surprising . at low temperatures a domain wall between two different ising phases",
    "mainly consists of diagonal sequences of vertices 5 and 6 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] ; its energy per unit length approximately equals @xmath76 . on the other hand",
    "a step consists mainly of long horizontal and vertical chains of overturned arrows and has an approximate energy per unit length of @xmath77 . to a first approximation steps do not couple with the ising order , since the reconstructed phase remains the same at both sides of the step ( see fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] ) .",
    "hence one would expect the kt line ( characterized by vanishing step free energy ) and the ising line ( vanishing ising domain wall free energy ) to cross near @xmath78 .",
    "we think that the actual non - crossing of the two lines can be explained as follows .",
    "when temperature is raised , more and more closed steps will be formed on the surface as one approaches the roughening temperature @xmath43 . on these steps",
    "the direction of the arrows is reversed . in this way",
    "the ising order parameter becomes more and more diluted , which will , eventually , strongly reduce the free energy of a domain wall .",
    "if in the end the closed steps become so prolific that they cover on average half of the surface , without becoming of infinite length , the ising order disappears without roughening of the surface .",
    "for @xmath79 the thermal behaviour implied by our phase diagram is quite intricate and remarkable . at low temperatures the surface is in a @xmath80 reconstructed flat phase ,",
    "then on raising the temperature there is a second order transition to a dof phase , rapidly followed by a kt transition to a rough phase .",
    "next there is a reentrant kt transition to the dof phase .",
    "this is an inverted roughening transition similar to the one described in @xcite .",
    "finally , as temperature approaches infinity , the system asymptotically approaches a rough phase again .",
    "instead for @xmath81 the system goes through a single phase transition from the ordered to a dof phase and remains flat for all finite temperatures .",
    "transfer matrix techniques are frequently used in studies of the critical properties of two dimensional systems with short range interactions .",
    "the construction of the transfer matrix ( tm ) follows a standard procedure and the interested reader is referred to the existing literature @xcite for details .",
    "we use two different transfer matrices , one oriented parallel to the axes of the vertex lattice and another one tilted of @xmath82 with respect to these axes .",
    "we refer to the former as _ vertical _ tm and to the latter as _ diagonal _ tm ( fig .",
    "[ fig07 ] shows a configuration of the diagonal tm ) .",
    "we consider a lattice of width @xmath83 and height @xmath84 , with periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction .",
    "for the vertical tm the subdivision of the lattice into a white and a black sublattice , combined with the periodic boundary conditions , restricts @xmath83 to even values . for the diagonal tm the horizontal and vertical axis",
    "are chosen along the diagonals of the vertex lattice and @xmath83 can be odd as well as even .",
    "the element @xmath85 of the matrix is defined as the boltzmann weight of a row of @xmath83 vertices generated by arrow configurations labeled by the indices @xmath7 and @xmath42 .",
    "one has @xmath86 if this row of vertices does not satisfy the ice rule . for the vertical tm ,",
    "if @xmath7 and @xmath42 are identical there are in fact two possible configurations of rows of vertices : in this case the transfer matrix simply sums their boltzmann weights .",
    "there are @xmath87 different arrow configurations for the vertical tm , whereas for the diagonal tm this number is @xmath88 .",
    "the largest values of @xmath83 we could treat numerically were @xmath89 for the vertical and @xmath90 for the diagonal tm .",
    "actually , due to the rotation of the lattice over @xmath82 the latter should be compared to @xmath91 for the vertical tm .    in the limit @xmath92 the partition function per row becomes : @xmath93 with @xmath94 the largest eigenvalue of @xmath11 , from which the free energy per row follows as @xmath95    to each state @xmath7 we associate a polarisation @xmath96 , with @xmath97 and @xmath98 the total numbers of up and down @xcite arrows in the state @xmath7 . by virtue of the periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction",
    "the transfer matrix can be reduced to blocks of fixed polarisation , since @xmath99 if @xmath100 ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "the so - called central block is the one corresponding to zero polarisation and describes a flat surface .",
    "the blocks with polarisation @xmath101 ( subcentral blocks ) describe a surface with a step .",
    "the difference between the free energies of a surface with a step and of a flat surface gives the step free energy , which , per unit of length , on an @xmath102 strip can be expressed as : @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the largest eigenvalue of the central and the subcentral block respectively @xcite .",
    "the study of this quantity will allow us to determine the roughening temperature .",
    "the deconstruction transition can be studied by considering two correlation lengths , which are both defined within the central block .",
    "we define the inverse correlation length @xmath106 as : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the second largest eigenvalue of the central block .",
    "the other correlation length can be calculated from the diagonal tm as the inverse of the domain wall free energy per unit length @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is given by @xmath111 with @xmath83 odd .",
    "indeed in the diagonal tm an @xmath102 strip , with @xmath83 odd , is partially frustrated since it can not accommodate the manhattan ground state without creating a domain wall ( see fig .",
    "[ fig07 ] ) .",
    "@xmath109 can be interpreted as the correlation length connected to the correlation function between two disorder variables @xcite .",
    "conformal invariance @xcite predicts that , at a critical point , the correlation lengths scale as @xmath83 , so the deconstruction transition can be located at the crossing point of the curves representing the scaled quantities @xmath112 and @xmath113 as functions of the temperature for different sizes .",
    "in reality , as shown in figs .  [ fig08](a ) and ( b ) , no perfect crossing is found .",
    "instead , pairs of curves obtained for sizes @xmath83 and @xmath114 intersect each other in a sequence of points , @xmath115 , respectively @xmath116 , which converges to the infinite system critical point @xmath117 , respectively @xmath118 .",
    "an extrapolation procedure requiring several iterations @xcite is then used to estimate @xmath119 or @xmath120 .",
    "of course the two independent estimates of the critical point have to coincide , which provides a good check on the internal consistency and accuracy of our procedures .    to locate the roughening temperature one has to employ a different method .",
    "the scaling @xmath121 holds not only at the kt transition but also inside the rough region , where the surface is in a critical state .",
    "there the curves @xmath122 , plotted as functions of temperature for different values of n , coalesce in the limit @xmath123 and the point where they detach from each other can be identified as the kt point ( see fig .  [ fig09 ] ) . for an accurate location of @xmath43 one",
    "has to use the universal properties of the kt transition which give rise to the scaling prediction @xcite    @xmath124    which holds exactly at @xmath125 , with @xmath126 and @xmath127 nonuniversal constants .",
    "the constant @xmath128 is characteristic for steps with a height of two vertical lattice spacings .",
    "the free energy of such a step corresponds to the line tension between a vortex - antivortex pair with vorticity 2 in the dual representation @xcite .",
    "the kt transition temperature is determined by requiring that a three - point fit of the form @xmath129 yields @xmath130 . for the extrapolation we used iterated fits in the spirit of ref .",
    "we performed this procedure along different lines across the phase diagram , scanning lines with @xmath131 fixed , lines with @xmath34 fixed and thermal trajectories .",
    "as we noted in the previous section , the critical line separating the flat from the rough region can be well characterized as a kt line .",
    "as we will see , the critical properties of the second order line are less well determined , especially in the region @xmath132",
    ". we will calculate critical exponents and central charge pertaining to the deconstruction transition using finite - size scaling methods .",
    "the two exponents @xmath133 and @xmath134 are related to the behaviour of the singular part of the surface free energy @xmath135 and of the domain wall free energy @xmath136 @xcite ( where @xmath137 , @xmath138 the deconstruction temperature ) .",
    "they satisfy the finite size scaling predictions @xmath139 and @xmath140 respectively , valid at the critical point @xmath141 .",
    "two other critical indices we will calculate are @xmath142 which represent the exponent of the spin - spin correlation function @xcite and that of the correlation function between disorder variables @xcite respectively . the numerical errors on the values assumed by these quantities are obtained as follows .",
    "we first evaluate the error on the determination of the critical temperature @xmath143 from the quality of the extrapolation to @xmath144 of our finite size data @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we extract the values of the exponents , again by iterated fits , at three different temperatures : @xmath145 , @xmath138 and @xmath146 . this procedure allows to determine the maximum possible variation on the values of @xmath147 , @xmath134 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 , thus assigning them an error bar .",
    "notice these errors are typically small if the critical temperature is determined accurately enough .",
    "finally , from conformal invariance @xcite it follows that the leading finite size correction to the free energy per site of an infinite system with periodic boundary conditions , @xmath150 , is determined by the central charge ( or conformal anomaly ) @xmath151 as @xmath152 in fact we analyzed the central charge using the finite size approximation    @xmath153    which converges to @xmath151 in the limit @xmath144 .    with the techniques described above we find that the deconstruction line for @xmath154 belongs no doubt to the ising universality class in sector b of our phase diagram .",
    "good convergence with increasing size is obtained for the critical exponents as well as for the central charge , the values of which are : @xmath155 in the region @xmath156 the situation is less clear .",
    "the convergence of the data with increasing system size is worse , the values of some of the critical exponents seem to vary along the critical line and the central charge can not be determined with any great accuracy . yet our results seem to clearly rule out the possibility that the critical line remains in the ising universality class .",

    "is known to be a common feature of finite size scaling in the vicinity of points where a change of universality class occurs . moreover , as @xmath131 becomes very small , the nearness of the kt line is seen to influence the convergence of the exponents of the deconstruction line . in conclusion",
    ", it seems quite plausible to have in practice only a window of @xmath131 values where constant critical exponents are found . to enlarge this window",

    "they also found a phase diagram with a second order line approaching a kt line .",
    "the exponents of the second order line clearly deviate from their ising values and the authors suggested they might be explained as tricritical ising exponents .",
    "applied to the staggered bcsos model this would mean a deconstruction line of ising type with a tricritical point , continuing beyond this point as a first order line , which is the phase behaviour of the annealed diluted ising ( or blume - capel @xcite ) model .",

    "these same finite size effects also make it impossible to tell whether at sufficiently small @xmath131 the deconstruction line becomes first order or not .",
    "the point along the deconstruction line where the change of universality class occurs is not sharply determined by our numerical results .",
    "we do not observe an abrupt jump of the exponents at a given point , rather a continuous shift .",
    "a reasonable candidate for the point separating the two regions ( i.e. ising and non - ising ) , could be the point where the deconstruction line crosses the line @xmath232 . crossing this line ,",
    "we find changes in the type of convergence of the exponents @xmath148 and @xmath179 ( sections v - a , b ) , although without an abrupt change in their values .",
    "we recall that in the surface representation of the model , in one region the coupling constants between the atoms in the two sublattices are both negative ( @xmath154 , @xmath203 ) ; in the other ( where the deconstruction transition is of ising type ) one of the two coupling constants is positive ( @xmath233 ) . in terms of the vertex lattice , in the region @xmath233 ,",
    "vertices 5 and 6 are the excited vertices with the lower energy above the ground state value ; at @xmath203 , vertices 5 and 6 get the higher excitation energy .",
    "all these considerations suggest that the properties of the system may change between the two regions @xmath234 and @xmath132 and make it more plausible that the shifts in the exponents are not just due to cross - over , but also result from a real change of universality class of the deconstruction transition @xcite .",
    "in this article we studied the critical properties of the staggered bcsos model . using transfer matrix techniques we found two critical lines describing the deconstruction and the roughening of the @xmath235 surface of a two component bcc crystal .",
    "the two lines approach each other in part of the phase diagram , apparently without merging . according to our results the deconstruction line in part of the phase diagram changes its universality class from ising to non - ising , although further investigations are needed to make this point more convincing . on the basis of the exponents we find ,",
    "we conclude that a possible universality class matching these exponents reasonably well , in the region where the best convergence is found , is that of the four state potts model .",
    "another possible scenario is that proposed by bastiaansen and knops @xcite . in their six vertex model with interactions extended to further neighbours",
    "it is hard too to distinguish between a single critical line and two lines approaching each other , but remaining separate .",
    "they find critical exponents for the deconstruction transition clearly deviating from the ising values and conjecture that the observed criticality could be explained as tricritical ising behaviour .",
    "the idea of a diluted ising model is particularly attractive in our case where , as we have seen , the deconstruction transition is , to all likeliness , the consequence of the dilution of the ising order in the system caused by the formation of a large number of closed steps of finite length .",
    "unfortunately we find little numerical evidence for this scenario . finally , also",
    "the possibility of having a line with continuously varying exponents can not be completely excluded .",
    "other models of reconstructed surfaces have been studied by several authors .",
    "den nijs @xcite introduced a model that describes @xmath236 missing - row reconstructed surfaces of some fcc metals ( @xmath237 , @xmath238 ,  ) .",
    "he found a deconstruction and a roughening line merging into a single critical line , whith ising and kt behaviour simply superimposed . from his data , as presented in the literature , it is not possible to really distinguish between actual merging or mere rapid approach of the lines .",
    "a clear distinction to our model is that in den nijs model the deconstruction transition remains of ising type throughout .",
    "another class of models for the same metal surfaces has been developed and extensively studied by the trieste group @xcite .",
    "again a deconstruction line and a kt roughening line are seen to approach each other .",
    "depending on the microscopic details of the model , the deconstruction line keeps its ising character either all along , or up to a tricritical point where it changes to a first order line .    as mentioned in the introduction",
    "there are several other two dimensional models with kt and ising degrees of freedom .",
    "one that has received a lot of attention , starting from the beginning of the last decade @xcite , is the fully frustrated xy model , which describes certain two dimensional josephson junction arrays .",
    "the study of its critical behaviour has led to several different conjectures about its universality class and critical exponents .",
    "several papers @xcite report non - ising exponents and it has been suggested that the model would belong to a novel type of universality class . to our knowledge , whether this type of universality class would or would not coincide with that of some known models has not been established yet . in the most recent study concerning the fully frustrated xy model olsson @xcite",
    "presents evidence of two separate transitions , a kt and an ising one where the former occurs at somewhat lower temperature than the latter : @xmath239 .",
    "this would be in agreement with our results since the xy model can be mapped onto a solid - on - solid model via a duality transformation @xcite , which maps the low temperature phase of one model onto the high temperature phase of the other and vice versa .",
    "olsson s work suggests that the non - ising exponents observed by other groups are due to the failure of some finite - size scaling hypothesis used in previous works . in the staggered bcsos model instead",
    ", we find clear evidence of non - ising exponents .",
    "unfortunately there exists no exact mapping between this model and the fully frustrated xy model , therefore they may well be in different universality classes .",
    "yet , we hope that some of the ideas developed in this paper to study the staggered bcsos model , will be generalised to other models so as to reach a deeper understanding of their critical properties .",
