    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) is a relation which states that the time - correlation function of an unperturbed system is equal to the response function of the perturbed system @xcite .",
    "for example , in a conductor , the current fluctuations are directly related to the ac - conductance .",
    "this means that the response of the system to the action of an external force is closely connected to the way their eigenstates can fluctuate .",

    "it is often thought that the fdt applies only at equilibrium and for linear response but in reality its validity domain is wider .",
    "the fdt has been discussed far and wide for over sixty years and continue to be a pivotal issue , notably concerning its generalization to non - linear , non - equilibrium , non - perturbative , interacting , and nano - scale systems @xcite . in some other works , this relation is used to deduce the electrical ac - conductance from the calculation of noise without having to include ac - voltage in the calculation @xcite , and constitutes a useful ingredient in the theoretical studies of electrical time - dependent transport in quantum systems @xcite , which are fully accessible experimentally @xcite . in the last years , these theoretical studies have been extended to the heat and thermoelectrical ac - transport in quantum systems @xcite but no direct connection has been established until now between the thermoelectrical admittance and the fluctuations mixing the electrical and heat currents in a quantum system .    in this paper , using the out - of - equilibrium keldysh green function formalism , we perform a direct calculation of the time - dependent electrical and heat currents associated to a quantum dot ( qd ) submitted to an ac - gate voltage .",
    "next , we derive the exact expressions of the electrical and thermoelectrical admittances and ac - conductances for any values of source - drain voltage , temperature , frequency and coupling strength to the reservoirs , and compare them to the expressions of the electrical and mixed noises in order to establish whether the fdt is verified .    this paper is organized as follows : the model and the formal expression of the electrical and heat currents are given in sec .",

    "<S> the electrical and heat currents flowing through a quantum dot are calculated in the presence of a time - modulated gate voltage with the help of the out - of - equilibrium green function technique . from the first harmonics of the currents , we extract the electrical and thermoelectrical admittances and ac - conductances . </S>",
    "<S> next , by a careful comparison of the ac - conductances with the finite - frequency electrical and mixed electrical - heat noises , we establish the fluctuation - dissipation relations linking these quantities , which are thus generalized out - of - equilibrium for a quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the electrical ac - conductance associated to the displacement current is thus directly linked to the electrical noise summed over reservoirs , whereas the relation between the thermoelectrical ac - conductance and the mixed noise contains an additional term proportional to the energy step that the electrons must overcome when travelling through the junction . </S>",
    "<S> a numerical study reveals however that the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is robust and applies as soon as one of the characteristic energies of the system dominates over the others . </S>"
