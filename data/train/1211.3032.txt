    "quantum systems are almost invariably coupled to an environment that degrades their coherence .",
    "decoherence of quantum systems is a fundamental problem , with implications across all branches of physics .",
    "the temporal evolution of a spin system in the presence of coupling to an environment is perhaps the simplest phenomenon involving decoherence .",
    "for example , a particle of spin 1/2 , which can be mapped onto any two - level system ( tls ) @xcite , and _ vice versa _ , has served as an important paradigm @xcite .",
    "specific examples include the decoherence of a qubit in a quantum - computer or quantum - information processor @xcite , spin dynamics in a magnetometer @xcite , accuracy and stability limitations of atomic clocks due to interactions with an environment @xcite , decoherence of two - level quantum dot systems @xcite , nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond @xcite .    under certain assumptions , which we discuss in the next section",
    ", the evolution of a spin in the presence of an environment can be represented by evolving the spin in an effective magnetic field , @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath1 is a deterministic magnetic field ( which can be time - dependent ) that can be used to exert control over the spin .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath2 models the influence of an environment on the system , and is represented by a vector stochastic process @xmath3 .",
    "averaging over fluctuations corresponds to tracing out the environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "this yields a reduced , non - unitary dynamics wherein the averaged spin decoheres in time .",
    "the physical properties of the environment determine the statistical properties of @xmath2 , which in turn determine the type of stochastic process @xmath3 .",
    "here we consider several types of stochastic fluctuations .",
    "a prototype model for fluctuations is gaussian white noise @xcite , a random process having vanishing correlation time . as a consequence ,",
    "the system driven by it evolves without _ memory _ , since it has no way to probe the past .",
    "a natural generalization is a gaussian colored noise @xcite , wherein the random process has a finite correlation time , hence , the system evolves with memory .",
    "the ubiquitousness of this type of noise can be attributed to central limit theorem which states that the superposition of a very large collection of independent sources of fluctuation tends to gaussian noise . moreover , in some spin systems there are more than one source of noise which differ in their intensity and correlation time scale .",
    "for example , in the nitrogen - vacancy diamond system @xcite , nv centers experience slowly fluctuating noise from @xmath4c impurity nuclear magnetic moments , and extremely fast fluctuations from nearby electronic nitrogen spins .",
    "the former can be modeled by colored noise , which is characterized by a very long correlation time , while the latter can be treated as a white noise , since it sets the fastest time scale in the system . a particular case of colored noise that is _ not _ gaussian , telegraph noise , has been studied in connection with quantum dot qubit systems @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite claims that telegraph noise can be used to model the environment of systems where a spin can interact with relatively few random fluctuators in its neighborhood , and these fluctuators go back and forth between only two states .",
    "the idea of using stochastic methods for modeling an environment or other complex interactions within the spin system is not new .",
    "for example , the problem of the line shape in paramagnetic resonance is discussed in ref .",
    "it was assumed that the electrons in an atom are affected by a perturbation which varies randomly in time at a rate determined by exchange interactions . as a result ,",
    "the fluctuations around the stationary state are induced and their effect on the absorption spectra can be calculated .",
    "another example is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors consider an ensemble of spins interacting with an environment as well as each other .",
    "the problem of calculating the effects of these complex interactions on the observed line shape is circumvented by introducing stochastic fluctuations of the precession frequency of the observed spins .",
    "the goal of this work is to develop methods to describe and analyze the process of relaxation of a single spin induced by contact with an environment .",
    "an important result of our analysis is that , when the spin evolves with memory , it can be manipulated by applying a sufficiently strong deterministic magnetic field @xmath1 to significantly suppress decoherence .",
    "we hope that the level of generality and overall simplicity of our approach allows for a straightforward application to appropriate experimental systems .",
    "the outline of the this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : spin_dyamics ] develops the equations of motion for a spin in the presence of a deterministic magnetic field and a stochastically fluctuating magnetic field .",
    "section  [ sec : gcn ] describes evolution of the system with gaussian colored noise fluctuations . in that section",
    "we present a simple , intuitive view of the nature of the decay of the averaged spin due to field fluctuations .",
    "we also show that this decay can be suppressed when the deterministic magnetic field is strong enough , and the correlation time is long enough ( i.e. , when the system has memory ) .",
    "section  [ sec : white - noise ] develops the white noise limit of colored noise .",
    "section  [ sec : memory ] explains the effects of memory on decoherence , and sec .",
    "[ sec : telegraph ] considers telegraph noise , which is a specific from of non - gaussian noise .",
    "finally , a summary and a conclusion are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "we consider fluctuations in an otherwise deterministic system that results from the application of a effective random field generated by an environment with which it interacts .",
    "the back - coupling of the spin to the source of the noise is not taken into account ( van kampen @xcite calls this _ external noise _ ) .",
    "hence , the stochastic properties of the noise result only from the environment which is unaffected by the system .",
    "we assume that these properties can be measured or otherwise deduced . for each particular system",
    ", one should carefully check whether the back - action can indeed be neglected .",
    "examples of systems for which back - action was neglected include : nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamond affected by magnetic moments of impurity spins @xcite , electron spin in a quantum dot affected by nuclear magnetic moments that fluctuate due to crystal lattice vibrations @xcite , and magnetic noise in atom chips caused by fluctuations of electron currents in wires that make up the atom chip @xcite .",
    "consider a particle of spin @xmath5 with magnetic moment @xmath6 in the presence of a time - dependent field @xmath7 .",

    "the magnetic field @xmath15 is the sum of a deterministic field , @xmath1 , whose direction defines the @xmath16-axis , and a fluctuating field , @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the rabi frequency is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "for simplicity , we have taken the deterministic field to have a component only along the @xmath16-axis .",
    "if the deterministic field varies slowly in time ( adiabatically ) , our conclusions below remain valid , but for deterministic fields that vary more quickly , the simple version of the deterministic part of the evolution matrix that satisfies eq .",

    "( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) , is easy to evaluate , and leads to the vector form of the equation , @xmath24 and the initial condition is simply @xmath25 the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : bloch ] ) with the initial condition ( [ eq : initial ] ) can be written as a 3@xmath263 evolution matrix , @xmath27 , acting on the initial vector , @xmath28 .",
    "it is convenient to write the equations , @xmath29 , in vector notation as @xmath30 , where the hat @xmath31 indicates a 3@xmath263 matrix . for convenience ,",
    "let us take the deterministic field @xmath32 to be constant in time . substituting into the equations of motion yields , @xmath33 here the matrix elements of @xmath34",

    "the equation of motion for the spin does not depend upon the details of the representation of the spin , hence the solution to the dynamics for an arbitrary spin is also given by ( [ eq : u ] ) .",
    "the only indication of the spin representation , i.e. , the dimension @xmath43 of the representation , is in the initial condition .",
    "experimental measurements of the spin will of necessity correspond to quantum expectation values and averages over the stochastic fluctuations of the magnetic field .",
    "hence the quantity @xmath44 corresponds to experimental measurements of the spin .",
    "here , the symbol @xmath45 means quantum average , and the symbol @xmath46 means average over stochastic variables .",
    "note that the average over fluctuations and the average over the initial quantum state factorizes in the following way : @xmath47 .    for spin 1/2 ( i.e. , for a tls ) , the average expectation value of the spin @xmath48 fully determines the state of the system .",
    "this is because the density matrix @xmath49 can be expressed using the pauli matrices @xmath50 which , together with identity operator @xmath51 , form a basis in the space of 2@xmath262 hermitian matrices . in the schrdinger representation , @xmath52 and the expectation values of the spin at time @xmath53",
    "is given by vector parameter @xmath54 .",
    "thus , at any time @xmath53 , there are three parameters , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , which completely specify the density matrix .",
    "this does not mean that the dynamics of the density matrix for any @xmath57-level system can be represented in terms of the dynamics of a particle with spin @xmath58 coupled to a magnetic field , since the number of parameters necessary to specify the density matrix larger than the three components of the spin @xcite .",
    "first , let us consider a process that is gaussian , isotropic and markovian @xcite .",
    "the field fluctuates in all three dimensions with independent components ( isotropy ) and statistical properties of each component is completely determined by the first two moments ( gaussian ) , the average and the correlation function .",
    "the stationary condition means that the correlation function depends on the time difference and the average is time independent .",
    "according to doob s theorem @xcite , if the process is also markovian , the correlation function is exponential and the average is zero , i.e. , @xmath59 here the bar indicates average over the fluctuations , @xmath60 is the correlation function with correlation time @xmath61 , the average fluctuating rabi frequency vanishes , @xmath62 , and the variance of the rabi frequency , @xmath63 , specifies the strength of the fluctuations .",
    "several comments regarding guassian colored noise are in order .",
    "first , note that the gaussian process can model a wide variety of environments due to the central limit theorem ; if the environment consists of many individual and independent fluctuating elements , the central limit theorem substantiates the approximation of using a gaussian process as the effective field affecting the spin . secondly",
    ", if there is no back - action of the spin on the environment , and the environment is in a stationary state ( e.g. , is in equilibrium ) then the process is stationary as well .",
    "finally , the isotropy assumption regarding the random magnetic field produced by the environment is appropriate if no particular special direction can be associated with the environment .    to solve the equation of motion ( [ eq : u ] ) , first we eliminate the so called _ drift term _ due to the deterministic part of the magnetic field , @xmath64 , from the right hand side of the equation by transforming to the rotating frame .",

    "hence , each realization draws a trajectory of the spin on a sphere of radius @xmath158 . the evolution can be viewed in a simplified `` stroboscopic '' picture in which , within a correlation time @xmath61 , the axis @xmath22 does not change much , and subsequently , it jumps to a new random value within a range on the order of @xmath159 . eventually such a sequence of rotations around randomly selected axes `` smears '' the trajectories of the spin over the whole sphere .",
    "this results in the decay of the spin averaged over all realizations .",
    "the situation is different when a constant field along , say , the @xmath16-axis is present .",
    "this becomes clear when we view the evolution in the reference frame rotating with frequency @xmath32 around the @xmath16-axis .",
    "consider a particular realization of the fluctuating field @xmath156 , and denote it in the rotating frame as @xmath160 .",
    "since @xmath161 , the fluctuations in the direction parallel to the constant field are unchanged when shifted to the rotating frame .",
    "on the other hand , the projection of the fluctuating field on the plane perpendicular to @xmath16-axis , @xmath162 , is modified when viewed in the rotating frame . within a time of order the correlation time @xmath61",
    ", the projection @xmath163 revolves around the @xmath16-axis with frequency @xmath32 , and if @xmath132 , @xmath163 is able to perform many revolutions between jumps .",
    "the effect of the jumps becomes negligible in comparison with the systematic rotation .",
    "thus the stochastic character of @xmath164 is lost , and the only contribution to the decay caused by fluctuations comes from @xmath165 .",
    "a similar effect provides stable motion of a spinning top , and for that reason we will refer to it as a _",
    "gyroscopic effect_. if @xmath121 , then revolution in between jumps is negligible , so @xmath166 , and by necessity the decay induced by the fluctuations must be almost the same as if there was no constant field at all .",
    "the suppression mechanism of the decay described above is inoperative in the white noise limit where the correlation time vanishes , so the fluctuations of the rotation axis are instantaneous . hence , the decay caused by white noise can not be affected by a constant field of finite intensity . moreover , even if the strength of the fluctuations is small in comparison to @xmath32 , the effect of fluctuations can not be neglected if the correlation time is too short .",
    "note that the important dimensionless parameter here is @xmath167 , which can be interpreted as an average angle of precession due to the deterministic field within the time period of @xmath61 .",
    "bearing this in mind , it is clear that the conclusion of this paragraph remains valid even if the field @xmath32 varies in time as long as @xmath168 .",
    "moreover , the reasoning used above shows that the same decay suppression effects apply even for non - gaussian noise as long as it has non - vanishing correlation time .",
    "we verify this assessment in the following section .",
    "in this section we present an example of a non - gaussian process , telegraph noise , i.e. , dichotomic noise corresponding to a memoryless continuous - time stochastic process that jumps between two distinct values , sometimes called burst noise @xcite .",
    "we consider telegraph noise in one component of the field , @xmath165 .",
    "the rabi frequency of the fluctuating field , @xmath165 , jumps randomly between @xmath169 and @xmath170 , with a jump rate @xmath171 . the average value and the correlation function of such a process is given by @xmath172 because telegraph noise is non - gaussian",
    ", the correlation function @xmath173 does not contain all the information regarding the process .",
    "telegraph noise can model the effect of a spin 1/2 impurity atom near the spin @xcite .",
    "the impurity spin has probabilities @xmath174 and @xmath175 for being in the spin - up and spin - down state , and a hopping rate for transferring from one spin state to the other .",
    "neglecting the back - action of the magnetic moment on the impurity , this model reduces to telegraph noise .",
    "our goal is to find the average evolution matrix @xmath176 for the telegraph noise case .",
    "the technique we have used previously to find the average does not work in the case of telegraph noise , because unlike with gaussian processes , the closed form of the cumulant generating functional is not known .",
    "fortunately , it is still possible to find an exact , analytical formula for @xmath176 if the fluctuations are parallel to the constant field .",
    "one way of solving for @xmath176 is to follow ref .",
    "we can write the average evolution operator as @xmath177 , where @xmath178 are the averages conditional on @xmath165 being equal to @xmath179 .",
    "these averages vary in time because of equation of motion ( [ eq : u ] ) , and because @xmath165 jumps .",
    "thus , @xmath180 adding and subtracting these equations , we obtain @xmath181 where @xmath182 .",
    "the next step is to eliminate @xmath183 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : av_ev_op ] ) by substituting the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : d_ev_op ] ) , with the initial condition @xmath184 .",
    "this yields a closed equation for average evolution matrix : @xmath185 note the particular form of the `` memory integral '' in the equation ( [ eq : tele_eq ] ) , where the dynamical variable is evaluated at times previous to @xmath53 . in this case",
    "the system clearly has memory and it remembers not only the history of the noise but also its own history .",

    "the effects of @xmath32 and @xmath165 on the components of the spin in @xmath120 plane are simply superposed : constant field causes trivial precession around @xmath16 axis , while the noise makes the @xmath74 and @xmath75 spin components decay on average .",
    "moreover , if the constant field and the fluctuating field are parallel , the gyroscopic effect can not be observed .",
    "the only memory effect present in this case is a quadratic behavior in @xmath53 of the decay rate at @xmath191 .",
    "figure  [ fig_telegraph ] plots @xmath192 versus time for telegraph noise in @xmath165 for the case of no static external magnetic present . as @xmath193 increases",
    ", @xmath192 decays more quickly , but for @xmath194 , the square root @xmath195 becomes imaginary and the solution changes form from pure decay to decay with oscillations .",
    "it is of interest to see what happens when noise is present in the component of the field perpendicular to the constant field @xmath32 , e.g. , in @xmath196 .",
    "unfortunately , in this case , it is not possible to obtain a closed form expression for the average evolution matrix . according to the previous discussion",
    ", one would expect that , since telegraph noise is colored noise ( the correlation time @xmath61 is finite ) , the gyroscopic effect should work in a fashion similar to the gaussian colored noise example .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "numerical solutions of @xmath197 versus time are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_telegraph_perp ] and suppression of the decay is more efficient with increasing @xmath128 .",
    "we introduced a stochastic model for spin in the presence of a deterministic magnetic field and a fluctuating magnetic field ( noise ) , and we derived stochastic equations of motion for the spin vector @xmath198 .",
    "the environmental degrees of freedom , represented by the fluctuations of the field , are eliminated by taking the average over the fluctuations to obtain @xmath199 .",
    "we made the _ external noise _ assumption , wherein no back - action of the system on the environment is present .",
    "the most pronounced consequence of this assumption is that the system does not go into equilibrium with a thermal environment , but instead goes to the most democratic density matrix , i.e. , the system tends towards the completely mixed state , and @xmath200 as @xmath201 .",
    "this is in contradistinction to the case of noise experienced by a system in contact with a bath wherein the bath affects the system _ and _ vice versa .",
    "the lack of mutual interaction ( back - action ) means that the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite can not be applied , and a thermal equilibrium state of the system is not obtained at large times .",
    "if back - action on the bath due to the system is present , the source of the fluctuations and the dissipation is the same , they are connected through fluctuation - dissipation theorem , and thermal equilibrium of the system must result .",
    "we explicitly considered gaussian colored noise , gaussian white noise and non - guassian telegraph noise . from our studies",
    "we conclude that if the system has memory , i.e. , it has a finite correlation time , then the system can be manipulated by means of an external magnetic field , and the decoherence induced by the fluctuations can be significantly suppressed . however , in the white noise limit , when the correlation function tends to a dirac delta function , the decoherence can not be controlled in this way .",
    "we introduced simple and intuitive considerations for why the suppression of decay can be achieved for any stochastic process as long as the correlation time is long enough .",
