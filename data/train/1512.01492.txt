    "the gibbs phase rule  @xcite epitomizes the basic notion that in equilibrium , the state of a macroscopic substance is fully specified by a small set of intensive variables , such as temperature , pressure , and the molar fractions of chemically distinct components . as appreciated by gibbs some 140 years ago ,",
    "equilibria with respect to particle and momentum exchange differ from each other in a basic way : to ensure equilibrium with regard to particle exchange between distinct phases , the chemical potentials for each individual component in a mixture must be matched between the phases .",
    "in contrast , mechanical equilibrium is guaranteed already by uniformity of the full pressure ; there is no need to match the _ partial _ pressures of individual species .",
    "thus with each additional component in the mixture , the number of independent variables that could be in principle used to describe an equilibrium phase increases .",
    "viewed alternatively , this means that the number of distinct phases that could be in mutual equilibrium grows with each additional component .",
    "situations in which some of the phases are only _ finite _ in size , but still containing a substantial number of molecules , can be also described rather parsimoniously with the help of equilibrium thermodynamics , at the modest expense of introducing a free energy cost of an interface between distinct phases . in this picture , the chemical potentials are still spatially uniform , while the pressure changes discontinuously across the interface , the discontinuity scaling with the interface curvature according to the venerable laplace formula .",
    "the corresponding limit of an infinitely - thin interface can be formulated in an internally - consistent fashion for large inclusions of minority phases ,  @xcite but becomes ambiguous on molecular lengthscales because at its face value , a discontinuous pressure jump implies there is an uncompensated force acting on a subset of molecules .    in his seminal work",
    ",  @xcite van der waals sought to remove this ambiguity by explicitly accounting for the free energy cost of _ gradual _ density variations . within a semi - phenomenological framework equivalent to the landau - ginzburg functional theory but predating it by a half - century or so",
    ", van der waals treats distinct phases in physical contact and their mutual interface on the same footing .",
    "he shows that the pressure and density change continuously across a finite - curvature interface between two coexisting phases .",
    "van der waals s results were rediscovered and generalized in later analyses by cahn and hilliard ,  @xcite and hart .",
    "@xcite an alternative , quite fruitful line of work , in which the surface tension could be directly related to detailed molecular interactions , was spurred by pioneering work of kirkwood and buff ,  @xcite see reviews in refs .  .",
    "here we extend the van der waals analysis to multi - component fluids while explicitly allowing for a density dependence of the free energy cost for spatial variations in the density itself ; the latter cost generally varies between phases .",
    "importantly , we are also able to include in the treatment situations that are steady - state only locally ; this is useful for deviations from equilibrium and in the presence of chemical reactions .",
    "the present work is partially motivated by a challenging problem of current interest , viz . , the formation mechanism of the puzzling mesoscopic clusters of a dense protein fluid found in some protein solutions .  @xcite pan et al .",
    "@xcite have put forth a microscopic scenario , by which the mesoscopic clusters consist of a spatially inhomogeneous , off - equilibrium mixture of monomeric protein and a transient , protein - containing complex . already in their preliminary analysis ,",
    "pan et al .",
    "@xcite suggest that in the presence of protein - complex formation and decay , the chemical potentials of the species involved become spatially inhomogeneous even in steady state .",
    "the inhomogeneity is largely contained within the interface and would not be captured within the thin interface approximation , thus necessitating a treatment at least at the van der waals level .",
    "the reaction - diffusion equations are non - linear and prone to numerical instabilities ; numerical solutions lack transparency that can be afforded by analytical treatment . yet a certain class of functional forms for the bulk free energy , i.e.",
    ", a collection of intersecting paraboloids , allows for analytical treatment while preserving several essential features of thick interfaces . hereby , the free energy surface is quadratic throughout except at some well - defined dividing surface .",
    "thus , by construction , the free energy can experience a discontinuity in the gradient and even in the function itself .",
    "how does one `` patch '' together the solutions for the pure phases in the presence of such singularities ?",
    "this question can be answered at the landau - ginzburg ( lg ) level , since the latter affords one a simple expression for the local pressure , which further simplifies in spherical geometry .",
    "the present treatment of local pressure is based on a formal analogy between the landau - ginzburg free energy functional and the mechanical action ; the spatial coordinate traversing the phase boundary in the former context is analogous to the time in the latter context . in the case of macroscopic coexistence , an lg - based treatment automatically yields the familiar pascal s law , which is formally analogous to energy conservation in mechanics . for spherical droplets , on the other hand , there is a pressure excess inside ; this excess is well approximated by the laplace expression when the droplet is sufficiently large .",
    "we will observe that the boundary conditions that must be imposed on the order parameter at the singularity of the bulk free energy amount to a continuity of local pressure and , in fact , hearken back to conditions for macroscopic phase equilibrium elucidated by gibbs , except that now pressure may be explicitly coordinate - dependent .",
    "the resulting treatment allows one to explicitly build the free energy profile for droplet nucleation as a function of the droplet radius and the chemical composition at the phase boundary .",
    "we establish that the composition at the droplet boundary changes little during nucleation .",
    "the developed formalism is next generalized to situations where the local pressure is _ not _ spatially homogeneous even for flat interfaces .",
    "important examples of such situations are phase boundaries pinned by an external potential ; the situation can alternatively be thought of as amphiphilic molecules collecting at phase boundaries . in the resulting , simple treatment , we explicitly observe the effects of the amphiphiles activity on the renormalization of the surface tension . we obtain explicit coordinate dependences of pressure and chemical potential _ within _ the interface , as well as the explicit form of the binding potential between the interface and the detergent .",
    "the mathematical simplicity of the formalism allows one to work both in equilibrium and away from equilibrium , in a steady - state approximation for individual phases .",
    "the above developments turn out to afford one an arguably simplified perspective at yet another , deep problem that has been a subject of much interest and controversy ,  @xcite namely the mechanism of activated transport in glassy liquids .",
    "@xcite we will observe that the down - renormalization of the free energy barrier for activated transport in glassy liquids can be thought of as a decrease in the surface tension of an inter - phase boundary in the presence of uniformly seeded , randomly oriented amphiphiles .",
    "the square - root scaling of the mismatch penalty between dissimilar aperiodic structures with the size of the reconfiguring region can be viewed as a consequence of the law of large numbers .",
    "likewise , the present formalism allows one to flesh out the `` wetting '' view of the mismatch penalty , due to xia and wolynes .",
    "@xcite connections with other existing treatments of glassy dynamics can be also made .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section  [ review ] we provide a brief pedagogical review of how to set up the problem of phase coexistence at the landau - ginzburg level . in section  [ pressure ] , we derive an expression for local pressure for the lg functional , which yields an explicit formula for spherical geometries .",
    "there we establish pascal s law and develop a systematic treatment of local pressure that can be applied to mixtures and off - equilibrium configurations .",
    "these results are used to obtain explicit droplet solutions for liquid mixtures in section  [ cnt ] and the problem of a flat interface exposed to a pinning potential and/or amphiphilic adsorbents in section  [ amphi ] .",
    "these developments provide two alternative perspectives on the problem of renormalization of the mismatch penalty between dissimilar aperiodic structures in glassy liquids , which is discussed in section  [ wettingsection ] .",
    "the final section  [ summary ] briefly summarizes the present findings .",
    "consider a landau - ginzburg free energy functional : @xmath0 \\equiv \\int    d^3 { \\bm r}f({\\bm r}),\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is thus the local free energy density .",
    "the quantity @xmath2 corresponds with the bulk free energy density of a spatially uniform system @xmath3 , since under these circumstances @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the total volume .",

    "the quantity @xmath7 is a suitable intensive variable of interest .",
    "the continuum integral in eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) can be thought of as a limit of a discrete sum over cells with fixed volumes , the cells tiling the space .",
    "thus @xmath6 must be regarded as a free energy computed at constant volume , insofar as the order parameter reflects density variations .",

    "@xcite if , on the other hand , the degree of freedom of interest @xmath7 is not strongly coupled to the density , as would be the case for the magnetization in a magnet , the volume integration in eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) largely amounts to a summation over sites hosting the degree of freedom and does not put limitation on the specific choice of free energy .",
    "an interesting example of the latter situation is represented by continuum mechanics  @xcite , even though the latter theory explicitly deals with deformations such as density changes . in continuum",
    "mechanics , the integration is over the volume of an _ undeformed _ sample and , thus , can be thought of as , essentially , a sum over lattice sites , not integration over actual space .",
    "when the order parameter corresponds to a conserved quantity  such as the particle number  discontinuous phase transitions are signalled by the presence of a sign change in the second derivative @xmath16 .",
    "consider , for instance , the helmholtz free energy of a spatially homogeneous van der waals gas below the critical point , at fixed temperature and particle number .",
    "the free energy can be computed by formal integration @xmath17 of the van der waals isotherm @xmath18 , see sketch in fig .",

    ", the dependence of the free energy on volume is given by the straight line @xmath24 , which is the double tangent line that runs _ under _ the @xmath21 curve that was calculated under the assumption of complete spatial uniformity of the gas .",
    "we remind the reader that the helmholtz free energy @xmath25 must be at its minimum at constant temperature and volume .",
    "@xcite viewed this way , the entropy @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is understood in its gibbsian sense , where the probabilities @xmath28 represent the statistical weights of microstates @xmath12 and can be computed under a constraint of one s liking .",

    "only one of those configurations , viz .",

    "indeed , only at the corresponding pressure @xmath34 do the gibbs free energies @xmath35 and , hence , the bulk chemical potentials of the two phases become equal : @xmath36 , since @xmath37 .",
    "@xcite    in the context of the density functional in eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) , it is practical to vary the particle number at constant volume ; density fluctuations are thus viewed as fluctuations of the particle number at fixed volume , not fluctuations of the local specific volume .",
    "the sketch in fig .",
    "[ bulk](b ) of the helmholtz free energy density @xmath38 as a function of concentration @xmath39 , at constant volume , demonstrates that there are an infinite number of ways for two phases to co - exist in which there is no particle exchange between the phases : @xmath40 . yet",
    "only one of these configurations is also in _ mechanical _ equilibrium , so that @xmath41 .",

    "[ bulk](b ) has been chosen , for concreteness , so that the bulk vapor is oversaturated with respect to the liquid .",
    "the notion of the metastability of the vapor state becomes particularly vivid if one stipulates that either state 1 or 2 be the reference  or _",

( the choice of the standard state is , of course , arbitrary and is made according to one s convenience . ) formally , making state 1 the standard state is accomplished by using the free energy density @xmath45 where the fixed quantity @xmath46 is numerically equal to the chemical potential at concentration @xmath47 ( or @xmath48 ) according to the original helmholtz free energy @xmath49 .",
    "the equilibrium values of the concentration ",

    "one can alternatively think of @xmath46 as an externally imposed chemical potential . hereby , the actual ( bulk ) chemical potential @xmath52 is equal to @xmath46 only in equilibrium , i.e. , at the minima of @xmath50 .",
    "because at the minima , @xmath53 , the depths of the minima of @xmath50 are numerically equal to the negative pressure .",
    "note that when the vapor and liquid are in equilibrium with respect to particle exchange but not in mechanical equilibrium , as in fig .",
    "[ v ] , the pressure is always greater in the undersaturated phase , as expected , while the magnitude of the deviation @xmath54 from the equilibrium value @xmath55 is always greater in the denser phase .",
    "the free energy density in fig .  [ v ] is a typical example of the free energy density @xmath50 from eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) in the context of a _ discontinuous _ phase transition .",
    "hereby , the order parameter has distinct values in the distinct phases of interest ; the two phases correspond to the two minima of the function @xmath50 , which are separated by a barrier .",
    "another common example of a conserved order parameter is magnetization , call it @xmath56 . in this case , the role of the chemical potential @xmath52 is played by the externally imposed magnetic field @xmath57 , since @xmath58 .",
    "the transition itself amounts to a reversal of the magnetization of a magnet cooled below its curie point . in the rest of the paper , we largely limit ourselves to fluid mixtures made of @xmath59 components whose concentrations we denote with @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "we specifically allow the coefficient @xmath62 at the square gradient term in eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) to explicitly depend on the order parameters .",
    "( the dependence of @xmath62 on the coordinate is thus exclusively through the coordinate dependence of the order parameter , if any . )",
    "this coefficient directly reflects particle - particle interactions and thus generally differs between distinct phases of matter .",
    "specifically , the coefficient @xmath62 ( for a pure substance ) scales linearly with the direct correlation function @xmath63/\\delta n ( { \\bm r}_1 ) \\ , \\delta n",
    "( { \\bm r}_2)$ ] , where the derivative is evaluated at equilibrium density and @xmath64 is the non - ideal portion of the free energy .",
    "the direct correlation function in a fluid generally scales with the bulk modulus and thus sensitively depends on the density and temperature .",
    "explicit calculations for the coefficient @xmath62 can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite    we thus adopt the following landau - ginzburg functional : @xmath65\\ ] ] where the summation is over distinct chemical species .",
    "the matrix @xmath66 is automatically symmetric , @xmath67 , and , also , positive - definite by construction .",
    "the free energy of the configuration @xmath68 within a connected region , relative to that of configuration @xmath69 , is given to the first order in a ( small ) quantity @xmath70 by the expression : @xmath71 where the first and second integrals are over the boundary and the bulk of the region , respectively , and @xmath72    by eq .",
    "( [ dfn ] ) , the quantity @xmath73 it thus equals the free energy cost of adding a particle to the system at point @xmath74 , i.e. , the local chemical potential . we see from eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) that in addition to the obvious contribution @xmath75 , the local chemical potential also exhibits contributions due to the free energy cost of density variations .",
    "if the local cost of adding a particle is not spatially homogeneous , particle fluxes will emerge spontaneously . in spatial dimensions three and higher , phenomenological fick s law can be used to connect the particle fluxes @xmath76 and the gradients of the chemical potentials of the species present : @xmath77 where the symmetric  @xcite matrix @xmath78 represents a set of self - diffusion coefficents .",
    "these quantities are generally concentration - dependent and can be related to the regular diffusivities through compressibilities .",
    "for instance ,",
    "eq .  ( [ fick ] ) yields for a pure substance near equilibrium : @xmath79 , while @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the compressibility and specific volume respectively",
    "consequently , the ordinary diffusivity @xmath83 .",
    "( [ fick ] ) , together with particle conservation @xmath84 , allows one to write down a system of equations governing relaxation of the system toward equilibrium  @xcite : @xmath85 with @xmath86 from eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) .    by eq .",
    "( [ fick ] ) , the chemical potential must be spatially uniform in full equilibrium : @xmath87 where we have used that steady state is also the standard state , by construction .",
    "however , the condition for _ local _ steady state is much less restrictive . according to eq .",
    "( [ nidot ] ) , one must only require that @xmath88 , which allows for spatially varying chemical potentials .    to avoid confusion",
    ", we note that eq .",
    "( [ nidot ] ) is incomplete in two ways , in addition to being phenomenological .",
    "for one thing , it does not account for advection , which is generally present in mixtures .",
    "@xcite indeed , an individual component can flow also with the mixture as a whole , not only by itself .",
    "still , this complication does not arise in steady state , when there is no net flow .",
    "also , eqs .",
    "( [ nidot ] ) should properly contain terms accounting for thermal noise  @xcite to describe processes other than relaxation toward equilibrium .",
    "although less common , non - conserved order parameters are encountered in applications too . in the absence of a conservation law for the order parameter , one often uses the empirical landau - onsager ansatz  @xcite for the time evolution of the system :  @xcite @xmath89 eq .",
    "( [ lo ] ) is the simplest empirical law one can write down that relates the rate of relaxation toward or away from steady state to the deviation @xmath90 of the order parameter @xmath91 from its steady - state value @xmath92 that optimizes the functional : @xmath93 .",
    "finally note that eqs .",
    "( [ mui ] ) and ( [ mu0 ] ) on the one hand and eq .",
    "( [ lo ] ) on the other hand imply the equations determining the steady state themselves are identical for conserved and non - conserved order parameters , even though relaxation toward or away from steady state is governed by distinct laws in the two cases .",
    "stationary points of the functional that are also _ minima _ correspond to a spatially uniform system residing wholly in a specific phase .",
    "such a free energy minimum will be either stable or metastable according to whether the corresponding minimum in the bulk free energy density @xmath2 is stable or metastable . in the following",
    ", we will be discussing additional stationary points of the functional that correspond not to minima but to _ saddle points_. such saddle points , if any , are transition - state configurations that could arise during a phase transition between two phases .",
    "specifically , we consider _ droplet _ configurations such that the order parameters achieve their bulk values @xmath94 in the majority phase , at infinity .",
    "we demand that near the origin , the mixture is on the other side of the transition state of the bulk free energy density @xmath50 , i.e. , in the minority phase .    in the limit of thin interface ,",
    "the transition - state droplet configuration is obviously spherically symmetric , since this configuration minimizes the surface area for a given volume of the droplet .",
    "alternatively said , such spherically - symmetric configuration satisfies pascal s law within individual phases because it insures uniformity of pressure ( separately ) on the inside and outside .",
    "below we assume that the bulk free energy density does not explicitly depend on the coordinate , @xmath95 , unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "now , when the interface is not thin , it appears difficult to make general statements about the symmetry of the droplet solution because eqs .",
    "( [ mu0 ] ) are non - linear .",
    "still , inasmuch as we expect the lowest free energy saddle point to be unique we can also expect the corresponding solution to be spherically symmetric . indeed , suppose on the contrary that the solution is only of _ discrete _ symmetry with respect to rotations .",
    "further , suppose for the sake of argument that this solution transforms under the corresponding symmetry operations in the same way as the coordinate @xmath96 .",
    "for each such solution , there will be also two other solutions , transforming as the coordinates @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively , which contradicts the original assumption that the solution is unique .",
    "cylindrically  but not spherically  symmetric solutions can be dismissed by the same token .",
    "the following boundary conditions thus apply to spherically symmetric droplets : @xmath99 the actual values of the order parameters may not reach their bulk values @xmath100 in the minority phase .",
    "however in view of the reflection symmetry of the problem , their spatial derivatives must vanish at the origin to avoid a discontinuity .    in the presence of spherical symmetry ,",
    "( [ mu ] ) yields in @xmath101 spatial dimensions : @xmath102 note the dependence of @xmath66 on the coordinate is exclusively through the coordinate dependences of the concentrations .",
    "multiplying eq .",
    "( [ elsph ] ) by @xmath103 , summing over @xmath12 , and integrating from some point 1 to point 2 yields : @xmath104 in deriving the above equation , we have taken advantage of the symmetry of the @xmath66 matrix .",
    "one immediately observes that when @xmath105 , i.e. , for a flat interface , and in complete equilibrium , @xmath106 , the following quantity is conserved : @xmath107 this is expected based on the formal correspondence between the free energy function ( [ fmulti ] ) in the @xmath105 , @xmath106 case and the action in classical mechanics ,  @xcite i.e. @xmath108 $ ] . hereby , the concentrations @xmath60 are the analogs of the mechanical coordinates @xmath109 , the coordinate @xmath96 of time @xmath110 , and the bulk free energy density @xmath50 of the negative potential energy @xmath111 .",
    "the conserved quantity ( [ cons ] ) is thus formally analogous to energy in mechanics .    taking the above , formal correspondence with mechanics a step further",
    ", we note that the mechanical energy is the partial ( not full ! ) derivative of the mechanical action with respect to time , with the minus sign .  @xcite we can use this notion to establish that the analog of the mechanical energy in the present context is actually the",
    "_ mechanical pressure_. the latter statement turns out to be correct not only in 1d , but , more generally , in any number of dimensions so long as the steady state solution is spherically symmetric . indeed , consider first an arbitrary droplet geometry .",
    "it will be convenient to switch to a modified free energy function @xmath112 : @xmath113 where @xmath86 s are now regarded as some preset functions of the coordinate @xmath74 .",
    "the quantity @xmath6 is the helmholtz free energy density corresponding to the functional in eq .",
    "( [ fmulti ] ) .",
    "the free energy of the configuration @xmath68 within a connected region , relative to that of configuration @xmath69 , is given to the first order in a ( small ) quantity @xmath114 by the expression : @xmath115 we now limit our attention to those specific concentration profiles that satisfy eq .",
    "( [ mui ] ) . for those specific profiles ,",
    "the function @xmath112 is actually a legendre transform of the functional @xmath116 , namely , the grand - canonical free energy as defined for a coordinate - dependent chemical potential : @xmath117 under these circumstances , the volume integral vanishes in eq .",

    "note the above equation is invariant with respect to the choice of the standard state for the chemical potential , as it should be .",
    "( [ p ] ) , by itself , can not be used to determine the pressure in arbitrary geometries , unless the orientation of the isobaric surface happens to be known .",
    "some insight may be already gleaned , however , when the @xmath66 matrix is diagonal , in which case it is easy to write an upper bound for the pressure that does not depend on that orientation : @xmath131 note that eqs .",

    "the spatial homogeneity of pressure for a flat interface  and , hence , during _ macroscopic _ phase coexistence  is , of course , the familiar pascal s law .",

    "( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ psph ] ) yield for an equilibrium flat interface perpendicular to the @xmath96 axis : @xmath136 one may think of this equation as saying that the variation in the order parameter exactly compensates for the decrease in pressure , due to the bulk free energy term @xmath50 , that arises in the transition state .",
    "this is not unlike how the variation in the chemical potential , due to the bulk free energy term , is exactly compensated by the spatial variation in the order parameter in eqs .  ( [ mu ] ) and ( [ mu0 ] ) .",

    "one starts from a high free energy state as resulting from bringing in contact two dissimilar structures ; the strain is uniformly high in such a state .",
    "one then picks through alternative structures within a compact region of some size @xmath277 until the best match is found that lowers the free energy to the greatest extent .",

    "consistent with the large breadth of the distorted interface , the mismatch penalty between the region and its environment is distributed over the whole region , in contrast with the dft - based picture from section  [ cnt ] , in which the penalty is accrued largely over a narrow shell .    in the context of the preceding section , one may view the random field of the rfim ( and , hence , the frozen - in fluctuations of the rfot ) as a collection of stationed amphiphilic molecules that are distributed uniformly in space .",
    "the molecules are randomly oriented and sized .",
    "indeed , because the on - site field is zero on average , for each site with a field oriented in a particular direction , there will be a site with a field equal in magnitude and opposite in direction .",
    "it is easy to see that beyond a certain threshold value of the magnitude of the on - site field , an originally smooth interface will distort spontaneously . as discussed in section  [ amphi ] ,",
    "if the activity of the amphiphile exceeds a certain value , the total amount of interfacial regions begins to increase .",
    "this results either in a bigger number of droplets or in a distortion of the interface , if the number of droplets can not change for some reason .",

    "we thus set our reference state in the bouchaud - biroli way . in the presence of the `` amphiphiles , ''",
    "the boundary will distort some .",
    "since the amphiphiles are distributed uniformly in space , the interface will come in contact with a new set of the amphiphiles and distort some more .",
    "the interface will continue distorting until the interfacial material covers all the amphiphiles contained within the region .",
    "one can view the distorted interface as having the same _ bare _ surface tension coefficient as a standalone undistorted interface but stretched and covering more amphiphiles , see fig .",
    "[ villain](a ) . in this view , the decreased _ effective _ surface tension is due to the solvation energy of the amphiphiles that are in contact with the interface , despite the greatly increased area of the distorted interface .",

    "@xcite this sequence constitutes a continuous renormalization - group transformation .",
    "the end result of this transformation , up to wavelength @xmath145 , is an effective interface that is not stretched but is thicker and _ softer _ , see sketch in fig .  [ villain](b ) .",
    "the renormalized interface covers fewer amphiphiles , because some of the amphiphiles are already effectively accounted for through the softened tension .",
    "the renormalization - group argument is standard ;  @xcite it was revisited recently  @xcite and will not be repeated here .",
    "the role of the on - site field is now played by the local value of the amphiphile activity @xmath247 .",
    "lubchenko and rabochiy  @xcite used an rg line of thought to argue that given a sufficiently large value of @xmath145 , surface renormalization occurs for any positive value of @xmath247 , no matter how small .",
    "the basic reason is that the stabilization due to the distortion scales as @xmath294 , where @xmath295 is the number of amphiphiles `` swept '' during an individual step in the renormalization procedure .",
    "the penalty for stretching of the interface scales with a higher power of @xmath295 and thus always inferior to @xmath296 at sufficiently small @xmath295 , so long as @xmath297 .",
    "@xcite    the scaling of the eventual amount of renormalization with the region size can be deduced with little effort by noting that the extent of renormalization scales approximately linearly with the total activity of the amphiphilic molecules residing within the boundary , see fig .",
    "[ sigmaepsilon ] .",
    "since the orientations of the latter molecules are random , the total activity is on average zero , but could be either positive or negative for a specific configuration of the interface . the magnitude of such total activity fluctuation scales as the usual @xmath298 , by the law of large numbers .",
    "the latter law applies when the correlation length @xmath169 is not too large , which is indeed the case .",
    "@xcite negative fluctuations will be more likely than the positive ones , according to boltzmann .",
    "these negative fluctuations will lead to a stabilization of the region in question , the amount of stabilization scaling as @xmath298 , as just said .",
    "the latter stabilization corresponds with the @xmath299 term in eq .",
    "( [ zn ] ) , at @xmath300 , and is consistent with the picture advanced by the rfot theory .",
    "as follows from the above discussion , a macroscopically large flat interface will continue to distort indefinitely , in the presence of uniformly seeded amphiphiles ( @xmath301 limit in fig  [ villain ] ) .",
    "this is why the effective surface tension coefficient of a flat interface _ vanishes _ in the rfot theory .",
    "one may say that there is no conventional surface tension between alternative aperiodic minima of free energy in glassy liquids , in the sense of the classical nucleation theory .",
    "it turns out that the main formula of this article , eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) , provides an additional perspective on this fascinating fact , if combined with earlier ideas of xia and wolynes .",
    "@xcite the latter authors pictured the surface tension renormalization as a `` wetting '' of the interface between two distinct meanfield free energy minima of the glassy liquid by configurations that are representative of _ other _ meanfield minima .",
    "@xcite    in considering interface wetting , let us use a bulk free energy density that does not explicitly depend on the coordinate : @xmath95 .",
    "to set the stage , we first consider the geometry in which three nearly flat , intersecting interfaces separate some three distinct liquid phases , call them a , b , and c. the three interfaces intersect along the same straight line , see fig .",
    "[ wetting](a ) .",
    "this geometry can also be thought of as approximating a small portion of an oblate bubble of phase b residing between two distinct phases a and c , see fig .",
    "[ wetting](b ) . formally ,",
    "to realize such a three - phase fluid coexistence , the liquid must consist of at least two components , by the gibbs phase rule . by construction  and for future convenience ",
    "suppose phase a is relatively rich in component 1 and intermediate with regard to the content of component 2 .",
    "phase b is poor in both components , and c is poor in component 1 and rich in component 2 , see fig .",
    "[ wetting](a ) .",
    "the isobaric surfaces are roughly similar to the @xmath302 surfaces , but certainly not to the @xmath303 surfaces .",
    "the former surfaces are represented by closed contours centered generically at the three - phase boundary .",
    "the @xmath303 surfaces , in contrast , are approximately parallel to the @xmath96 and @xmath97 axes on fig .",
    "[ wetting](a ) .    because the external normal to an isobaric surface is no longer collinear with the concentration gradients , the first term under the sum in eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) is significantly reduced compared with a spherically symmetric situation , much more so than the second term .",
    "this is particularly obvious if one sets the off - diagonal elements @xmath66 , @xmath304 to zero .",
    "( a quick thought shows that the contribution of the off - diagonal terms in the geometry from fig .",
    "[ wetting](a ) is relatively small even if the off - diagonal @xmath66 are non - zero , because the @xmath132 gradients are mutually , approximately orthogonal . ) to estimate the reduction in the first term , assume the gradients of each concentration @xmath60 preserve their directions as one goes around an isobaric surface .",
    "meanwhile , the external normal @xmath133 performs a full rotation per each closed path around the line . under these circumstances , the average @xmath305 in @xmath101 spatial dimensions",
    "indeed , the rotational average @xmath306 , where @xmath307 is the @xmath12-th component of the unit vector @xmath133 . this is because @xmath308 and @xmath309 .",
    "we thus observe that in the geometry of fig .",
    "[ wetting](a ) , @xmath287 , the two terms under the sum in eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) largely compensate each other .",
    "the latter equation thus yields that the region in which the three phases coexist is at _ negative _ pressure , relative to the bulk .",
    "this is expected and constitutes a mechanically - stable geometry : the line where the three phases meet can be thought of as being suspended and pulled on by the two - phase boundaries .",
    "likewise , a point in 3d space where four distinct liquid phases meet , would be suspended on the lower - order phase boundaries and would be even at yet lower pressure , since the first term under the sum in eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) would get only smaller with @xmath101 .",
    "imagine now a spherical droplet of one phase surrounded by another phase and suppose that the boundary is wetted by a large number of alternative phases similarly to how the a - c interface is wetted by phase b in fig .",
    "[ wetting](b ) .",
    "imagine that new interfaces appearing during wetting are further wetted and so on , down to the correlation lengthscale @xmath169 of the landau - ginzburg theory for an individual phase . according to the above argument",
    ", the pressure must _ decrease _ as one moves inward from the bulk toward the center of the droplet .",
    "now , because there are no phase boundaries to suspend the low pressure region on , the latter region would _",
    "collapse_. alternatively , this situation could be thought of a corresponding to a negative surface tension coefficient , by eqs .",
    "( [ vdw ] ) and ( [ sigma ] ) . at their face value , the above notions are simply a consequence of the gibbs rule : given a finite number of components , only a finite number of phases is allowed and so the unlimited wetting described above is impossible .    yet in glassy liquids , the number of possible `` phases , '' which correspond with distinct free energy minima , grows exponentially with volume and is thus effectively unlimited .",
    "hence we conclude that the mismatch penalty between distinct free energy minima in a glassy liquid can not be defined in the conventional way .",
    "this notion is consistent with our earlier discussion of the surface tension renormalization in the presence of a random field , but it also fleshes out the `` wetting '' perspective on the renormalization of the mismatch penalty .    in applying the present result to glassy liquids , an important caveat must be made .",
    "strictly speaking , the functional ( [ fmulti ] ) applies to _ fluids _ , in which the shear modulus is zero . in arriving at eq .",
    "( [ fn ] ) , one adopts the view that the `` minority phase '' is an equilibrated liquid , by construction .",
    "the environment , on the other hand , represents a mechanically stable ( aperiodic ) solid , on the pertinent timescale . a solid can , in fact , support a compact region of negative pressure .",
    "this notion does not invalidate the present analysis so long as the glassy liquid is equilibrated on the laboratory timescale and so the reconfigurations occur without a volume change .",
    "still , there may be some residual stresses in the environment due to local inhomogeneity in stress .",
    "such inhomogeneities would be present even in a periodic crystal , let alone an aperiodic one .",
    "@xcite already the spatially - inhomogeneous bulk free energy from eq .",
    "( [ vfull ] ) captures , in part , long - range correlations that may arise as a result .",
    "indeed , the field from an elastic `` dipole '' made of two point - like forces can be emulated using the free energy functional ( [ fmulti ] ) by making the coefficients @xmath167 from eq .",
    "( [ vpara ] ) sufficiently small .",
    "a full treatment , however , must include off - diagonal entries of the strain - tensor .",
    "such treatments are available at the strict mean - field  @xcite and higher , onsager - cavity  @xcite levels .",
    "this work analyzes several phenomena in the area of phase transitions from a _ mechanical _ vantage point .",
    "it takes advantage of a formal analogy between the lagrangian formalism in classical mechanics and the landau - ginzburg description of macroscopic phase coexistence , in which the analog of time is the spatial coordinate that traverses the phase boundary .",
    "pressure , which is the partial derivative of the free energy with respect to that spatial coordinate , is formally analogous to the mechanical energy , which is the partial derivative of the action with respect to time .",
    "this analogy allows one to generalize the old  and surprisingly little known  results of van der waals on phase coexistence to multi - component mixtures and certain off - equilibrium situations .",
    "while automatically yielding that pascal s law must be obeyed during macroscopic coexistence , the approach can be extended straightforwardly to spherical geometries of the minority phase and , in some cases , to other geometries .",
    "the so obtained mechanical perspective on phase coexistence allows one to make progress in several problems that are seemingly disparate yet turn out to be connected .    in the first problem , of interest to mesoscopic phases in liquid solutions",
    ", we establish that certain singular forms of the bulk free energy density are amenable to essentially analytical solution in individual phases .",
    "to patch the solutions at the phase boundary , where the bulk free energy density is singular , one must require that pressure be a continuous function of the coordinate .",
    "we straightforwardly obtain a saddle - like free energy profile for a nucleus of the minority phase .",
    "the coordinate transverse to the nucleus size corresponds to the chemical composition at the interface .",
    "the coordinate is interesting in that its dynamics do not involve particle exchange with the bulk ; it thus must operate along the phase boundary , consistent with earlier , hydrodynamics - based analysis by siggia .",
    "@xcite the chemical composition at the interface is seen to depend only weakly on the droplet radius .",
    "the opposite situation of the _ violation _ of pascal s law leads us to a model that has a double use : surface tension renormalization in the presence of a pinning potential or in the presence of amphiphiles .",
    "simple relations between the amount of renormalization and the activity of the amphiphile are established .    in the two setups above , pascal s law is obeyed and violated respectively .",
    "although seemingly distinct , the two situations turn out to be two faces of the same coin in the final problem analyzed in this work . here",
    "we argue that the complicated problem of down - renormalization of the mismatch penalty between alternative aperiodic structures in glassy liquids can be thought about in a relatively simple fashion : on the one hand , the renormalization can be viewed as a distortion of the interface separating two dissimilar structures in the presence of uniformly seeded , randomly oriented amphiphiles . on the other hand",
    ", the renormalization of the mismatch can be viewed as extensive wetting of the interface by yet other aperiodic structures . in both views ,",
    "pascal s law is violated , yet in the latter view , it is violated only transiently since the bulk free energy does not explicitly depend on the coordinate .",
    "this reflects that the disorder in glassy liquids is self - generated , not quenched .",
    "both views indicate that the mismatch between alternative structures can not be described using conventional notions of the density functional theory even in the thick interface limit . yet",
    "the amphiphile view , which is rooted in those same notions , allows a way out of this seeming impasse : the renormalization can be thought of an essentially bulk effect due to a random field ( as stemming from the amphiphiles ) , which is zero on average .",
    "when it happens to be non - zero in any specific region , this field scales at most as the square root of the region size , thus resulting in a square root scaling of the mismatch penalty with the region size .",
    "this scaling is consistent with the rfot theory .",
