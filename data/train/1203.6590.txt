    "in 1993 an observation was made @xcite regarding the eigenvalues of the conventional quantum - harmonic - oscillator hamiltonian @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a real positive parameter .",
    "it was noted that while the standard eigenvalues of @xmath20 are real and positive @xmath21 if ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) are analytically continued in the complex-@xmath19 plane from positive to negative @xmath19 , the eigenvalues @xmath22 all become negative even though the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) appears to remain unchanged .",
    "surprisingly , the harmonic - oscillator hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) , which is a sum of squares , also possesses an infinite set of _ negative _ eigenvalues .    a careful treatment of the boundary conditions on the eigenfunctions is required to explain the appearance of negative eigenvalues .",
    "the conventional boundary conditions associated with the schrdinger eigenvalue differential equation @xmath23 are that @xmath24 as @xmath25 on the real axis .",
    "these boundary conditions hold not just on the real axis but in stokes wedges centered about the positive - real and negative - real axes in the complex-@xmath26 plane @xcite . specifically , the eigenfunctions @xmath27 vanish exponentially rapidly in the stokes wedges defined by @xmath28 and at @xmath29 . as the parameter @xmath19 rotates in the complex-@xmath19 plane in the positive ( anticlockwise ) direction from positive to negative values , the stokes wedges in the complex-@xmath26 plane rotate by @xmath30 in the negative ( clockwise ) direction and end up centered about the positive- and negative - imaginary axes .",
    "we thus ascertain that the harmonic - oscillator hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) has _ two _ sets of eigenvalues : positive eigenvalues , which arise when the boundary conditions are imposed in a pair of stokes wedges centered about the real-@xmath26 axis , and negative eigenvalues , which arise when the boundary conditions are imposed in a pair of stokes wedges centered about the imaginary-@xmath26 axis .",
    "the negative eigenvalues can be obtained directly by making the transformation @xmath31 this simple transformation replaces @xmath32 in ( [ e3 ] ) by @xmath33 and simultaneously replaces the boundary conditions on the real-@xmath26 axis with boundary conditions on the imaginary-@xmath34 axis .",
    "the question addressed in this paper is whether the negative - eigenvalue problem for the harmonic oscillator can be extended into the complex domain in a @xmath0-symmetric fashion . to understand this question",
    "let us recall that in order to construct a @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian , one begins with a conventional hermitian hamiltonian , such as the quantum - harmonic - oscillator hamiltonian , @xmath35 , and then introduces a parameter @xmath11 to extend the hamiltonian into the complex domain while preserving its @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the standard example of such a hamiltonian is @xcite @xmath36 as @xmath11 varies smoothly away from @xmath37 , the eigenvalues of this hamiltonian smoothly deform away from the harmonic - oscillator eigenvalues . if we begin with the positive harmonic - oscillator eigenvalues , the resulting discrete eigenvalues remain real and positive for all @xmath38 and the eigenvalues grow with increasing @xmath11 , as shown in fig .",
    "when the eigenvalues of a @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian are real , the hamiltonian is said to have an _ unbroken _",
    "@xmath0 symmetry .",
    "a hamiltonian with unbroken @xmath0 symmetry represents a physically viable and realistic quantum system , and such systems have been repeatedly observed and studied in laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "( @xmath39 ) . when @xmath40 , the eigenvalues are all real and positive , and increase with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "when @xmath11 decreases below @xmath37 , the eigenvalues disappear into the complex plane as complex conjugate pairs .",
    "eventually , only one real eigenvalue remains when @xmath11 is less than about @xmath41 , and as @xmath11 approaches @xmath42 from above , this eigenvalue becomes infinite . ]",
    "what happens if we begin with the _ negative _ harmonic - oscillator eigenvalues at @xmath5 , instead of the positive eigenvalues , and smoothly increase or decrease @xmath11 ? do the eigenvalues remain real and negative ? more generally , what happens if we begin with the negative eigenvalues that one obtains when @xmath13 ( @xmath43 ) [ see ( [ e6 ] ) ] , and then vary @xmath11 ? do the eigenvalues all remain real and negative ?",
    "we will see that if we begin with the negative - real eigenvalues at @xmath13 , the smallest - negative eigenvalue remains real and negative but only for a _",
    "finite range of _ @xmath11 and not an infinite range of @xmath11 : @xmath44 as @xmath11 approaches the upper and lower edges of the @xmath9th region , this eigenvalue approaches @xmath45 .",
    "the larger - negative eigenvalues eventually become complex .",
    "when @xmath15 , there are always a finite number of real negative eigenvalues and an infinite number of complex eigenvalues . the behaviors of the eigenvalues in the first three regions @xmath46 are shown in fig .",

    "[ s3 ] we use wkb to obtain accurate numerical approximations to the real eigenvalues .",
    "we show that wkb provides a clear explanation for why the eigenvalues in the @xmath9th region diverge at the lower and upper ends of the region , namely , that the turning points rotate out of the stokes wedges in which the eigenvalue problem is posed . in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] we make some brief concluding remarks .",
    "to construct a @xmath0-symmetric extension of the hamiltonian @xmath20 in ( [ e5 ] ) , we must recall the effects of @xmath59 and @xmath60 on the complex coordinate @xmath26 . under space reflection ( parity )",
    "the coordinate @xmath26 changes sign , @xmath61 , and under time reversal @xmath62 changes sign , @xmath63 . therefore , under the combined @xmath0 operation the complex coordinate @xmath26 is reflected about the imaginary axis .",
    "thus , as the schrdinger eigenvalue problem @xmath64 is posed in the cut complex-@xmath26 plane , the requirement of @xmath0 symmetry demands that the cut lie on the imaginary-@xmath26 axis .",
    "we take the cut to lie on the positive - imaginary axis ( see fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) because for the usual positive - eigenvalue solutions to the hamiltonian ( [ e5 ] ) the cut was originally taken to lie on the positive - imaginary axis @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalue problem ( [ e7 ] ) is then posed on a three - sheeted riemann surface . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , on sheet @xmath42 the complex argument of @xmath26 lies in the range @xmath65 , on sheet @xmath37 ( the principal sheet ) the range is @xmath66 , and on sheet @xmath67 the range is @xmath68 .    .",
    "as @xmath11 increases , the right wedge ( solid lines ) , which begins on sheets 0 and 1 , rotates clockwise and downward , as indicated by the solid double arrow and the wedge lies entirely on sheet 0 when @xmath69 .",
    "the wedge becomes thinner as it rotates , and its opening angle vanishes as @xmath70 ; at this point the center of the wedge lies at the angle @xmath71 .",
    "the behavior of the left wedge ( dotted lines ) mirrors the behavior of the right wedge , and its rotation is indicated by the double dotted arrow .",
    "the eigenvalue problem associated with these wedges has real eigenvalues when the turning points lie inside the wedges , and this occurs only when @xmath47 . ]",
    "using the techniques described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , we identify the stokes wedges in which the boundary conditions of the differential - equation eigenvalue problem are imposed .",
    "the centers of the right and left wedges are @xmath72 these angles lie on the principal sheet and are @xmath0-symmetric reflections of one another .",
    "the opening angle of the wedges is given by @xmath73 the angular locations of the upper and lower edges of the right wedge are @xmath74 and the angular locations of the upper and lower edges of the left wedge are @xmath75 note that the right wedge extends onto sheet @xmath67 and the left wedge extends onto sheet @xmath42 until @xmath11 becomes larger than @xmath67 .",
    "the wedges become thinner and rotate downward as @xmath11 increases , and as @xmath70 , the two wedges become infinitely thin and approach @xmath76 .    for positive eigenvalues @xmath32 , the turning points satisfy the equation @xmath77 and",
    "the turning points lie on the real axis when @xmath5 .",
    "however , for negative eigenvalues @xmath78 , the turning points satisfy the equation @xmath79 there is a pair of turning points located at the angles @xmath80 thus , when @xmath5 , the turning points lie on the imaginary axis and sit in the center of each wedge .    as @xmath11 varies , both the wedges and",
    "the turning points rotate in the complex-@xmath26 plane , but the turning points rotate _ faster _ than the wedges . thus , the turning points in ( [ e13 ] ) only lie inside of the wedges for the range of @xmath11 @xmath81 therefore , as we explain in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] , the wkb asymptotic estimate of the eigenvalues breaks down when @xmath11 is not in this range .",

    "we have computed the eigenvalues in the @xmath9th region ( @xmath46 ) numerically by integrating along the centers of the wedges and matching at the origin .",
    "this matching requires that the path go around the branch point at the origin , and thus the procedure is reminiscent of the toboggan contours studied by znojil @xcite .",
