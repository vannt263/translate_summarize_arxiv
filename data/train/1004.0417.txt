    "the statistical model known as the power law distribution has important applications in natural , social , economical and also in computing sciences .",
    "some related phenomena involving power law distribution are : scaling , universality , criticality , phase transitions @xcite , fractals @xcite , complex networks @xcite , earthquakes @xcite , size of files in a computer system @xcite , world wide web topology @xcite , information theory @xcite , financial indexes and assets price variations @xcite , individual income distribution @xcite , and many more .",
    "physicists are attempting to produce a general theory in order to explain , under an unified point of view , all this phenomena and the mechanism that drive them to produce a power law distribution .",
    "the main candidate seems to be currently known under the general name of complex systems science or complexity sciences .",
    "some preliminary progress has been achieved in this direction in the context of economical complex systems @xcite .    from the above",
    "said , it can be seen that the importance of the applied statistical problem of fitting a power law distribution is of great and current interest .",
    "however , difficulties involved in performing a fit of a power law to empirical data are many and very subtle ( exponent sensitivity to a big number of data entries , to the selection of the cut off parameter , discrimination of spurious power law distributions , etc . ) and many related and very interesting papers proposing new fitting methodologies , criticizing other or proposing alternative statistical models to the power law to describe empirical data have been recently published @xcite .",
    "this paper can be considered as a proposal to formalize and establish a solid statistical procedure to perform a good power law fit in the statistical sense , by means of considering an approach based on the statistical theory of estimation and tests of fit from left censored samples . in section [ mle ]",
    "the problem is reviewed and formalized , introducing the required technical aspects ; in section [ tests ] the statistical fitting procedure is described ; in section [ quad ] the class of quadratic statistics and the anderson - darling @xmath1 statistic are defined ; in section [ app ] we present the calculations for the asymptotic percentage points used to evaluate the goodness of the fit and in section [ speed ] results from a simulation study to investigate the speed of convergence of the calculated asymptotic percentage points to those observed empirically are shown . section [ example ] illustrates the fitting procedure with empirical data by means of an example from finance of a high theoretical and practical importance in econophysics , for financial scientists and traders : a power law fit for the tails of a set of daily variations of a financial index as the dow jones industrial average ( djia ) .",
    "finally , conclusions are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "a random variable @xmath2 is said to follow a power law distribution , if its cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) is given by    @xmath3    and it is required to test goodness of fit to the tails of this distribution using the largest values from the sample of their returns .",
    "this situation can be viewed performing estimation and goodness of fit under type ii left censoring , which corresponds to the case in which , for fixed @xmath4 , the @xmath5 smallest observations are missing , so the estimation and test procedures are based on the largest @xmath4 sample values @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the @xmath8th order statistic in a sample of size @xmath9 from an absolutely continuous distribution @xmath10 .",
    "given that the anderson - darling @xmath0 is known to be a powerful statistic for detecting departures in the tails from the hypothesized distribution , it becomes necessary to obtain its asymptotic distribution when the parameters of the distribution have been estimated based on a left censored sample .",
