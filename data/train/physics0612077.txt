    "the quest for the ultimate electron accelerator will never end . a better beam quality , a higher energy , a smaller size and lower costs will always be goals to be pursued .",
    "in particular , size and costs are strictly related .",
    "this justifies research activities towards higher and higher longitudinal field gradients . the availability of higher longitudinal field gradients is obviously related , in its turn , to the possibility of production of beams with higher energies .    at the present day ,",
    "particle accelerator technology is mainly based on radio - frequency ( rf ) devices .",
    "however , in the past few years a novel laser - plasma acceleration method has been developed and experimentally demonstrated @xcite , that promises to outclass all existing accelerator technologies .",
    "the laser - plasma acceleration technique requires an ultrashort ( a few femtoseconds long ) high intensity ( tera to peta - watt ) laser pulse focused into a supersonic helium gas jet ( or filled capillary ) with density around @xmath5 .",
    "this produces a region free of electrons propagating behind the laser pulse .",
    "many electrons ( up to @xmath6 ) are captured in this electron - free zone after about one plasma oscillation , and eventually accelerated by the huge electric field produced by the positive ion background with gradients up to tv / m . up - to - date experimental verifications demonstrated gradients of the order of @xmath0 gev / m , that can potentially accelerate electrons up to energies in the gev - range within a few millimeters .",
    "in this paper we study the important issue of longitudinal wake fields produced within electron beams accelerated with high - gradient fields .",
    "we assume that the acceleration distance @xmath7 is much smaller than the the overtaking length .",
    "this is the distance travelled by the electrons as a light signal from the tail of the bunch overtakes the head of the bunch . given a bunch of rms length @xmath8 , the overtaking length can thus be written as @xmath9 , and corresponds to the radiation formation length @xmath10 calculated at @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the reduced radiation wavelength . when @xmath13 , the electrons can be assumed to be accelerated at a single position",
    "@xmath14 down the beamline .",
    "this is the case for laser - plasma devices , since acceleration in the gev range takes place within a few millimeters only .",
    "however , it is not the case for conventional accelerators , that feature typical gradients up to a few tens of mev / m , and thus need several tens of meters to reach the gev range .",
    "the assumption @xmath13 greatly simplifies wake calculations .",
    "in particular , when this condition is verified , the wake generated along the part of the trajectory following the acceleration point @xmath14 is independent of any detail of the particular realization of the accelerator . in this sense ,",
    "our study is fundamental , because it remains valid independently of the particle accelerator technology chosen , provided that @xmath13 .",
    "one may also have contributions to the wake generated along the part of the trajectory following the acceleration point @xmath14 .",
    "these contributions depend on the physical nature of the accelerator , can be separately calculated , and will be neglected in this paper because they do not affect the bunch in the case of a laser - plasma accelerator .",
    "we base our study on the solution of maxwell s equations for the longitudinal field . with the help of the fundamental example of an electron travelling in uniform motion",
    "we show that the paraxial approximation can be applied to describe electromagnetic sources up to the observation point , while sources after the observation point in the beam propagation direction can be neglected .",
    "then we make use of the paraxial approximation to calculate the fourier transform of the longitudinal field produced by fixed electromagnetic sources ( current and charge densities ) at a certain observation plane down the beamline .",
    "this expression is at the basis of our treatment , because it allows to calculate a closed expression for the longitudinal impedance and for the wake function to be evaluated numerically .",
    "the knowledge of the real part of the impedance further allows verification of the energy conservation principle .",
    "impedance and wake function yield an analytical expression in the asymptotic limit of a large distance of the electron beam from the accelerator compared with the overtaking length , i.e. in the far - field zone for all wavelengths of interest ( up to @xmath15 ) .",
    "this asymptotic limit is of practical relevance , as it allows simple estimations of the impact of the longitudinal wake on the electron beam energy change .",
    "we give an application of our theoretical work by studying the feasibility of free - electron lasers ( fels ) drivers , proposed as a possible use of laser - plasma accelerators .",
    "coherent sources of electromagnetic radiation have become very important research tools in science and industry .",
    "recent advance in conventional ( rf ) particle accelerator techniques allow to construct and operate free - electron lasers in the vuv as well as in the x - ray range .",
    "lasing at wavelengths shorter than the ultra - violet can be achieved with a single - pass , high - gain fel amplifier . because of the lack of powerful , coherent seeding sources , short - wavelength fels work in the so - called self - amplified spontaneous emission ( sase ) mode , where the amplification process starts from shot noise in the electron beam @xcite .",
    "experimental realization of sase fels developed very rapidly during the last decade .",
    "the shortest wavelength ever generated by an fel , @xmath16 nm , has been achieved in 2006 at flash ( free - electron laser in hamburg ) .",
    "regular user operation of flash started in 2005 @xcite .",
    "currently , this facility produces gw - level laser - like radiation pulses with @xmath17 to @xmath18 fs duration in the wavelength range from @xmath19 to @xmath20 nm .",
    "recently , the german government , encouraged by these results , approved funding a hard x - ray sase fel ( xfel ) user facility , the european xfel @xcite .",
    "the us department of energy ( doe ) has approved the start of construction of the linac coherent light source ( lcls ) at the stanford linear accelerator center ( slac ) @xcite .",
    "the lcls and the european xfel project are scheduled to start operation in 2009 and 2013 respectively .    with the recent progress in the development of laser - plasma accelerators",
    "@xcite a discussion started about wether and how this technology can be used to provide a cost - effective driver for sase fels .",
    "the very short length scale of plasma acceleration may eventually allow for the development of very compact laser - like sources both in the vuv and in the x - ray range . in this paper",
    "we will not address the delicate issue of technical realization of such table - top fel drivers .",
    "these should finally provide short bunches up to about @xmath17 fs duration in the @xmath0 ka current class ( i.e. with a charge of about @xmath1 nc ) , featuring a relative energy spread of @xmath21 for beam energies in the gev range and a normalized emittance in the order of @xmath1 mm@xmath22mrad . instead , we will restrict our discussion to fundamental electrodynamical questions , supposing that laser - plasma drivers already exist .",
    "once this assumption is made , there are two ways of taking advantage of such device .",
    "the first way is conservative .",
    "up - to - date laser - plasma technology can produce beam energies up to about @xmath1 gev . with this energy ,",
    "one may use parameters for the system electron beam - undulator in the same range of those at flash . in this fashion one may eventually achieve wavelengths up to @xmath23 nm .",
    "this application amounts to substitution of the conventional accelerator system at flash with the table - top laser - plasma driver .",
    "this would not lead to a table - top vuv - fel , but it would certainly reduce its size .",
    "the only condition for this scheme to work is that a laser - plasma driver capable of providing the same beam parameters as the accelerator system at flash must first be built in reality .",
    "the second way is more ambitious , and consists in using laser - plasma accelerators in the gev range to build table - top x - ray fels by using a completely different set of parameters for the system electron beam - undulator .",
    "namely , an order of magnitude smaller electron energy , an order of magnitude larger peak current , an order of magnitude smaller undulator parameter and an order of magnitude shorter undulator period .",
    "the present study allows to estimate the influence of longitudinal wake fields on the relative energy change of the electron beam .",
    "in particular , we estimate the magnitude of the induced correlated energy - change as a function of the position within the bunch , as electrons travel through the undulator .",
    "this is a fundamental effect that can not be avoided by fine tuning of the parameters of the setup .",
    "moreover , the energy change grows during the passage of the beam through the undulator , so that one can not assume a fixed correlated energy change through the undulator .",
    "our conclusion is that the magnitude of this effect poses a serious threat to the feasibility of a table - top fel in the x - ray range ( tt - xfel ) , as well as in the vuv range ( tt - vuv fel ) .",
    "our work is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section [ sec : lfield ] we calculate the longitudinal field in the space - frequency domain . in the following section [ sec : wakpoi ]",
    "we introduce the basic quantities impedance and wake function , and we review their relation with the poynting theorem . in section [ sec : asymp ] we present an analytical expression for the asymptotes of the longitudinal impedance in the limit for a large longitudinal distance of the beam with respect to the overtaking length .",
    "we further verify the energy conservation principle in section [ sec : conse ] .",
    "section [ sec : enchange ] is dedicated to the calculation of an analytical expression for the asymptotes of the longitudinal wake , always in the limit for a large longitudinal distance of the beam with respect to the overtaking length .",
    "finally , our study about the feasibility of the tt - vuv fel and the tt - xfel is given in section [ sec : example ] .",
    "section [ sec : conc ] concludes our work with a few final remarks .",

    "the nominal lorentz factor of electrons is @xmath24 .",
    "the accelerator switches on both harmonics of the sources and of the field .",
    "since we consider the wake generated along the part of the trajectory following the acceleration point @xmath14 , the nature of the switcher is not important .",
    "it is important , though , that the switching process happens on a longitudinal scale @xmath25 , representing the distance that a light signal has to travel before it overtakes an electron of a distance @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath28 the angular frequency of the radiation in the space - frequency domain .",
    "significant emission of radiation in vacuum is present for wavelengths longer than the longitudinal bunch length @xmath8 , up to transverse beam sizes @xmath29 as we will see . as a result , for typical ultra - relativistic beams the condition @xmath25",
    "can be read @xmath30 , @xmath31 being the overtaking length .",
    "we begin our investigation with the help of general knowledge of electromagnetic theory @xcite , by calculating the longitudinal electric field in the space - frequency domain[multiblock footnote omitted ] @xmath32 produced at frequency @xmath28 by given electromagnetic sources in vacuum and detected at longitudinal position @xmath33 and transverse position @xmath34 ( see fig .",

    "this situation needs further study , based on detailed numerical simulations , that goes beyond the scope of this work .",

    "moreover , even though the electron beam energy has increased of an order of magnitude ( thus leading to a decrease of the energy change level ) , the @xmath356 parameter is decreased of an order of magnitude . since the undulator length is only a factor three shorter than the formation length",
    ", we conclude that wake fields constitute a major effect in this case too .",
    "such effect poses a serious threat to the operation of the tt - xfel setup .",
    "this work constitutes the first study of the impact of longitudinal wake fields on the quality of electron beams produced with high field - gradient accelerators .",
    "we restricted our attention to the analysis of the wake generated along the trajectory following the acceleration , and assuming that the acceleration happens on a short longitudinal scale compared with the overtaking length , i.e. @xmath266 .",
    "thus , our consideration does not depend on the particular realization of the accelerator . however , given present technological developments , one of the most relevant applications of our study should come from the realm of laser - plasma accelerators .",
    "we calculated longitudinal symmetric and anti - symmetric parts of the wake function as well as real and imaginary part of the impedance with the help of paraxial approximation within a space - frequency domain formulation of maxwell s equation . while the general expressions for wakes and impedances need numerical techniques to be evaluated , it is possible to present analytical expressions for the asymptotic limit when the electron bunch has reached a position , down the beamline , that is far from the acceleration point , with respect to the overtaking distance .",
    "it should be noted that in these cases the wake and the impedance are proportional to universal functions , valid for any set of parameters .",
    "our results can be used as analytical benchmarks for computer codes . moreover , the the asymptotic result for the antisymmetric part of the wake is of fundamental importance , in the sense that its validity is not restricted to the particular model studied in this paper ( fast acceleration ) . to the best of our knowledge , eq .",
