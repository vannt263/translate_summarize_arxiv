    "the two - zone model describing the electron temperatures within hii regions is commonly used for oxygen abundance determination ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it is typically used when only the electron temperature @xmath10 is measured and the value of the other temperature @xmath9 is estimated using a @xmath9@xmath10 relation . since the form of the @xmath9@xmath10 relation may be disputed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) the value of t@xmath5 can be rather uncertain even if accurate measurements of @xmath10 are available .    the majority of hii regions in spiral galaxies are low excitation objects ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) and , consequently , the o@xmath14 zone makes a significant ( or even dominant ) contribution to the total oxygen abundance .",
    "this shows that an accurate determination of @xmath9 is crucial for abundance determinations in hii regions of spiral galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the nitrogen abundances in hii regions are derived from a relation of the form @xmath15 .",
    "this , again , underlines that accurate determinations of @xmath9 is very important .",
    "the main objective of the present study is to find the electron temperatures in the zones of singly and doubly ionised oxygen , and a relation between them .",
    "the measured ratio @xmath3 of nebular - to - auroral lines of singly ionised nitrogen is used to determine the electron temperature @xmath8 in the low - ionization zone of the hii regions , and the measured ratio @xmath2 of nebular - to - auroral lines of singly ionised oxygen is used to determine the electron temperature @xmath7 .",

    "the measured ratio @xmath1 of nebular - to - auroral lines of doubly ionised oxygen is used to determine the electron temperature @xmath6 in the high - ionisation zone of the hii regions .",

    "secondly , a comparison between different electron temperatures requires a set of hii regions where measurements of the auroral lines [ oii]@xmath167320+@xmath167330 , [ nii]@xmath165755 , and [ oiii]@xmath164363 are all available .",
    "such measurements are quite scarce , but that problem may be tackled by constructing the corresponding ff relations .",

    "futhermore , if the measurements of the electron temperatures for two or more ions ( e.g. o@xmath29 and s@xmath29 ) were available for the hii region then the agreement ( or disagreement ) between these temperatures was used as an additional criterion : the difference between electron temperatures derived for o@xmath29 and s@xmath29 should not be in excess of 1000 k.    we believe that our criteria allow us to pick out the spectra of hii regions with reliable measurements of at least one auroral line ( [ nii]@xmath165755 , [ oii]@xmath167325 and [ oiii]@xmath164363 ) .",

    "[ figure : dt2n ] show the deviations @xmath86@xmath8 of galactic hii regions .",
    "the measured @xmath77 and @xmath65 temperatures in galactic hii regions are used .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ figure : dt2n ] shows that the general behaviour of the deviations in the case of galactic hii regions is quite similar to that of extragalactic hii regions .",
    "the galactic hii regions with weak r@xmath4 line fluxes follow the derived the @xmath8@xmath6 relation ( the deviations @xmath86@xmath8 are small ) and significant deviations occur in the case of galactic hii regions with strong r@xmath4 line fluxes . thus , the consideration of galactic hii regions confirms the results derived based on extragalactic hii regions .",
    "[ figure : t3o - t2n ] shows that there is a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath8 and @xmath6 within the uncertainties for hii regions with weak r@xmath4 lines .",
    "the hii regions with strong r@xmath4 line fluxes do not follow the @xmath8@xmath6 relation obtained from the hii regions with weak r@xmath4 line fluxes , and the deviations @xmath86@xmath8 do not depend on the electron temperature @xmath6 . as a result , the one - to - one correspondence between electron temperatures @xmath8 and @xmath6 disappears if a sample contains hii regions with both weak and strong r@xmath4 line fluxes .",
    "one may assume that the s / o abundance ratio is constant in all the hii regions since the sulfur and oxygen are thought to be produced by the same massive stars .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the [ oii ] and [ sii ] lines are formed at similar temperatures .",
    "the energy of the level that gives rise to the r@xmath5 line ( the [ oii]@xmath163727,3729 doublet ) is higher than the energy of the level giving rise to the s@xmath5 line ( the [ sii]@xmath166717,6731 doublet ) .",
    "thus , the line - emissivity ratio @xmath88(s@xmath5)/@xmath88(r@xmath5 ) is temperature sensitive , i.e. , the ratio increases with decreasing electron temperature .",
    "furthermore , the s@xmath14-zone does not coincide with the o@xmath14-zone .",
    "hence , the s@xmath5/r@xmath5 line ratio depends on two parameters ; the electron temperature @xmath9 and the size ratio of s@xmath14 and o@xmath14 zones @xmath70 .",
    "an analysis of the variation of the s@xmath5/o@xmath5 ratios in hii regions can help to illuminate the reason for the irregularity of high - r@xmath4 hii regions .",
    "[ figure : so ] shows the measured s@xmath5/r@xmath5 ratio as a function of electron temperature @xmath9 ( the values @xmath89 are used ) for hii regions from our sample together with a family of theoretical curves computed for different values of @xmath70 @xmath90 the solar s / o abundance ratio was used in the computations , i.e. , @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the line emissivities @xmath88(s@xmath5 ) and @xmath88(r@xmath5 ) were derived from the five - level - atom solution for s@xmath14 and o@xmath14 .",
    "the energy levels and the einstein coefficients for spontaneous transitions for five low - lying levels for s@xmath14 were taken from @xcite , the effective collision strengths for the electron impact were taken from @xcite . the atomic data for o@xmath14 were discussed above .",
    "[ figure : so ] shows a clear correlation between s@xmath5/r@xmath5 and @xmath9 .",
    "since there is a one - to - one correspondence between the @xmath9 and @xmath10 electron temperatures for high - metallicity hii regions , one might expect that there is also a correlation between s@xmath5/r@xmath5 and t@xmath4 .",
    "the use of the s@xmath5/r@xmath5 vs. @xmath10 instead of the s@xmath5/r@xmath5 vs. t@xmath5 diagram has the advantage that the direct measurements of @xmath6 in high - r@xmath4 hii regions are available in greater numbers than are direct measurements of @xmath7 and/or @xmath8 .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ figure : min ] shows the q@xmath92 vs. s@xmath5/r@xmath5 diagram .",
    "the open circles are hii regions with @xmath86@xmath93 , the filled circles are those with @xmath86@xmath94 , the open triangles are objects where @xmath8 is not measured .",
    "the low - metallicity ( 12+log(o / h ) @xmath81 7.2 ) hii regions in the dwarf galaxy ddo 68 @xcite are shown for comparison ( plus signs ) .",
    "[ figure : min ] ( the top panel ) shows a clear correlation between s@xmath5/r@xmath5 and q@xmath92 ; the s@xmath5/r@xmath5 line ratio decreases with decreasing of q@xmath92 .",
    "in fact , the s@xmath5/r@xmath5 value can be used as an alternative indicator of the @xmath10 , although the scatter in the q@xmath92 vs. s@xmath5/r@xmath5 relation is large .",
    "[ figure : min ] ( top panel ) shows that the hii regions with large deviations follow the general trend , although they are located near the end of the sequence .    the bottom panel of fig .",

    "r@xmath96 show a shift relative to the general trend obtained from the hii regions with @xmath60  r@xmath61 .",
    "there are two possible causes for this shift .",
    "either the high - r@xmath4 and the low - r@xmath4 hii regions do not belong to the same sequence ( the upper branch ) , or the line fluxes of low - ionisation ions ( n@xmath14 , o@xmath14 , s@xmath14 ) are distorted in hii regions with strong r@xmath4 line fluxes .",
    "our sample only contains hii regions with 12+log(o / h ) @xmath97 8.2 .",
    "this selection criterion comes from the following consideration .",
    "it is well known that the relation between the oxygen abundance and the strong oxygen - line intensities is double valued with two distinct sequences , traditionally known as the upper and the lower branches of the r@xmath19  o / h diagram .",
    "the transition zone between the upper and the lower branches is sometimes also taken into consideration @xcite .",
    "we adopt 12+log(o / h ) = 8.2 as the boundary between the upper branch and the transition zone .",
    "this division is somewhat arbitrary , however .",
    "[ figure : r23oh ] shows the r@xmath19  o / h diagram for the hii regions with measured @xmath8 or @xmath7 temperature .",
    "the question is , if one should adopt a higher oxygen abundance ( e.g. , 12+log(o / h ) = 8.4 ) as the boundary between the upper branch and the transition zone ?",
    "we believe that is probably not the way to solve the problem .",
    "it should be noted that both hii regions with small deviations and hii regions with large deviations follow the ff relation for @xmath1 rather well .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "[ figure : r23oh ] shows that the area occupied by the hii regions with large deviations is also populated by the hii regions with small deviations .",
    "finally , some high - metallicity galactic hii regions also show large deviations .",
    "it is possible that a criterion other than a specific metallicity should be used to divide the hii regions into sequences ( branches ) .",
    "the deviations suggest that the @xmath3 values are shifted in hii regions with strong r@xmath4 line fluxes ( high excitation parameter @xmath44 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the low - lying metastable levels in some ions are excited not only by the electron collisions , but may also be significantly populated by recombination processes @xcite . since recombination - excited emission of [ oii ] in the auroral @xmath167325 , and [ nii ] in the auroral @xmath165755 radiation will occur in the o@xmath29 zone ,",
    "the effect on the collision - excited lines will depend on the r@xmath4 line flux . as a result",
    ", one may expect a significant shift of the @xmath3 and @xmath2 values for hii regions with strong r@xmath4 line fluxes .",
    "our results are generally in agreement with this picture .",
    "however , other mechanisms causing a shift of this kind of the @xmath3 value can not be excluded .",
    "the electron temperatures of high - metallicity ( 12+log(o / h ) @xmath97 8.2 ) hii regions have been studied . empirical ff relations which express the nebular - to - auroral lines ratios ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ) in terms of the nebular r@xmath4 and r@xmath5 line fluxes in spectra of hii regions",
    "have been derived .",
    "the ff relations for @xmath2 and @xmath3 only reproduce the observational data in spectra of hii regions with weak nebular r@xmath4 line fluxes ( logr@xmath4 @xmath11 0.5 ) .",
    "the ff relation for @xmath1 , on the other hand , reproduces the observational data over the whole range of nebular r@xmath4 line fluxes .",
    "the @xmath9 ",
    "@xmath10 diagram has also been considered .",
    "we found that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the @xmath9 and @xmath10 electron temperatures , within the uncertainties of these electron temperatures , for hii regions with weak nebular r@xmath4 line fluxes .",
    "the derived @xmath65 ",
    "@xmath77 relation for these hii regions is very similar to the commonly used @xmath9 ",
    "@xmath10 relation after @xcite .",
    "the hii regions with strong nebular r@xmath4 line fluxes do not follow this relation , however .",
    "thus , as a result , the one - to - one correspondence between the electron temperatures @xmath8 and @xmath6 disappears if hii regions with both weak and strong r@xmath4 line fluxes are included .",
    "there is a discrepancy between @xmath8 and @xmath7 temperatures .",
    "the @xmath8 temperatures are systematically lower than the @xmath7 temperatures .",
    "the difference is small at low electron temperatures and increases with the electron temperature to about 10% at @xmath13 .",
    "the uncertainties in the atomic data ( einstein coefficients for spontaneous transitions and effective cross sections for electron impact ) may be the cause of this discrepancy .",
