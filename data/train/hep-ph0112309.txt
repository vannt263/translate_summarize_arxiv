    "light - front quantization has become a standard tool for the analysis of nonperturbative problems in quantum field theory as well as in string  @xcite and @xmath0-theory  @xcite .",
    "the light - front method is especially useful for quantum chromodynamics , since it provides a physically appealing yet rigorous extension of many - body quantum mechanics to relativistic bound states : the multi - quark , hidden - color and gluon momentum , helicity , and flavor correlations of a hadron are encoded in the form of universal process - independent lorentz - invariant wavefunctions . in higher dimension theories , the discretization of light - front momenta provides a way to describe the evolution of the world - sheet of strings  @xcite .",
    "the ect * international conference on light - cone physics : particles and strings ( trento 2001 ) provided an outstanding forum to assess the continuing progress in this field .",
    "this report can only cover a portion of the many interesting developments in light - cone physics made this past year .",
    "i will also review a number of new directions and applications .",
    "quantization at fixed light - cone time @xmath1  @xcite allows one to apply heisenberg matrix mechanics to relativistic quantum field theory . the heisenberg equation on the light - front",
    ", @xmath2 can , at least in principle , be solved by diagonalizing the matrix @xmath3 on the free fock basis :  @xcite the operator @xmath4 can be derived from the lagrangian of the theory using canonical quantization .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath5 of @xmath6 then give the squared invariant masses of the bound and continuum spectrum of the theory .",
    "the projections @xmath7 of the eigensolution on the @xmath8-particle fock states provide the light - front wavefunctions . thus solving a quantum field theory",
    "is equivalent to solving a coupled many - body quantum mechanics problem : @xmath9 \\psi_n = \\sum_{n'}\\int { \\left\\langle{n|v_{lc}|n'}\\right\\rangle } \\psi_{n ' } \\label{eq : feqm}\\ ] ] where the convolution and sum is understood over the fock number , transverse momenta , light - cone momentum fractions @xmath10 and spin projections of the intermediate states .",
    "here @xmath11 remarkably , the formalism is frame - independent ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath4 and the light - cone variables are independent of the total @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the system . a general review of light - front quantization methods is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the light - front wavefunctions @xmath14 of a hadron in qcd are the projections of the hadronic eigenstate on the free color - singlet fock state @xmath15 at a given light - cone time @xmath16 they thus represent the ensemble of quark and gluon states possible when a hadron is intercepted at the light - front .",
    "the wavefunctions are lorentz - invariant functions of the light - front momentum fractions @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 and are independent of the bound state s physical momentum @xmath21 , and @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the actual physical transverse momenta are @xmath22 the @xmath23 label the light - front spin @xmath24 projections of the quarks and gluons along the quantization @xmath25 direction .",
    "the physical gluon polarization vectors @xmath26 are specified in light - cone gauge by the conditions @xmath27 the parton degrees of freedom are thus all physical ; there are no faddeev - popov ghost terms or negative metric states .",
    "the spinors of the light - front formalism automatically incorporate the melosh - wigner rotation .",
    "the wavefunctions derived from light - front quantization play a central role in qcd phenomenology , providing a frame - independent description of hadrons in terms of their quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "a recent summary of their phenomenological applications can be found in ref .",
    "for example , any spacelike and timelike form factors and matrix elements of local currents @xmath28 , such as the semileptonic decay amplitudes of heavy hadrons have an exact representation as overlap momentum - space overlap integrals of light - front wavefunctions  @xcite .",
    "the light - front fock representation is particularly important for semi - leptonic exclusive matrix elements such as @xmath29 .",
    "the lorentz - invariant description requires both the overlap of @xmath30 parton - number conserving wavefunctions as well as the overlap of wavefunctions with parton numbers @xmath31 which arises from the annihilation of a quark - antiquark pair in the initial wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "the skewed parton distributions which control deeply virtual compton scattering can also be defined from diagonal and off - diagonal overlaps of light - front wavefunctions  @xcite .",
    "the key non - perturbative input for exclusive processes involving large momentum transfer is the gauge- and frame - independent hadron distribution amplitude @xcite defined as the integral of the valence ( lowest particle number ) fock wavefunction ; _ e.g. _  for the pion @xmath32 where the global cutoff @xmath33 is identified with the resolution @xmath34 .",
    "the distribution amplitude controls leading - twist exclusive amplitudes at high momentum transfer , and it can be related to the gauge - invariant bethe - salpeter wavefunction at equal light - cone time . the logarithmic evolution of hadron distribution amplitudes @xmath35 can be derived from the perturbatively - computable tail of the valence light - front wavefunction in the high transverse momentum regime @xcite .",
    "the conformal basis for the evolution of the three - quark distribution amplitudes for the baryons  @xcite has been obtained by braun _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "it is particularly important to understand the shape of the gauge- and process - independent meson and baryon valence - quark distribution amplitudes  @xcite @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "these quantities specify how a hadron shares its longitudinal momentum among its valence quarks ; they control virtually all exclusive processes involving a hard scale @xmath34 , including form factors , compton scattering , and photoproduction at large momentum transfer .",
    "new applications of the perturbative qcd factorization formalism were presented at this meeting in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "progress in measuring the basic parameters of electroweak interactions and @xmath38 violation will require a quantitative understanding of the dynamics and phase structure of @xmath39 decays at the amplitude level .",
    "factorization theorems have now been proven which allow one to rigorously compute certain types of exclusive @xmath39 decays in terms of the light - front wavefunctions and distribution amplitudes of b meson and the final state hadrons  @xcite .",
    "recent progress in this field was reviewed at this meeting by li  @xcite .",
    "the quark and gluon distributions of hadrons , including the spin and transversity distributions which enter hard inclusive reactions in qcd , can be defined as probability measures and density matrices of the light - front wavefunctions .",
    "for example , the quark distribution in a hadron @xmath40 is @xmath41\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times |\\psi_{n / h}(x_i , k_{\\perp i})|^2 \\sum_{j = q } \\delta(x_{bj}-x_j).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it has been conventional to identify the leading - twist structure functions @xmath42 measured in deep inelastic lepton scattering with the light - front probability distributions . for example , in the parton model , @xmath43 however , hoyer , marchal , peigne , sannino , and i  @xcite have recently shown that the leading - twist contribution to deep inelastic scattering is affected by diffractive rescattering of a quark in the target , a coherent effect which is not included in the light - front wavefunctions , even in light - cone gauge . the effective gluon propagator in light - cone gauge @xmath44 is singular : @xmath45 .\\label{lcprop}\\ ] ] it has a pole at @xmath46 which can be defined by an analytic prescription such as the mandelstam - liebbrandt prescription  @xcite . in final - state scattering involving on - shell intermediate states ,",
    "the exchanged momentum @xmath47 is of @xmath48 in the target rest frame , which enhances the second term of the light - cone gauge propagator .",
    "this enhancement allows rescattering to contribute at leading twist even in lc gauge .",
    "we have verified in feynman and light - cone gauge that diffractive contributions to the deep inelastic scattering @xmath49 cross sections , which leave the target intact , contribute at leading twist to deep inelastic scattering  @xcite .",
    "diffractive events resolve the quark - gluon structure of the virtual photon , not the quark - gluon structure of the target , and thus they give contributions to structure functions which are not target parton probabilities .",
    "our analysis of deep inelastic scattering @xmath50 , when interpreted in frames with @xmath51 also supports the color dipole description of deep inelastic lepton scattering at small @xmath52 .",
    "for example , in the case of the aligned - jet configurations , one can understand @xmath53 at high energies as due to the coherent color gauge interactions of the incoming quark - pair state of the photon interacting , first coherently and finally incoherently , in the target .",
    "the distinction between structure functions and target parton probabilities is also implied by the glauber - gribov picture of nuclear shadowing  @xcite . in this framework , shadowing arises from interference of rescattering amplitudes involving diffraction channels and on - shell intermediate states .",
    "in contrast , the wave function of a stable target is strictly real since it does not have on energy - shell configurations .",
    "thus nuclear shadowing is not a property of the light - front wavefunctions of a nuclear target ; rather , it involves the total dynamics of the @xmath54-nucleus collision .",
    "a strictly probabilistic interpretation of the deep inelastic cross section cross section is thus precluded .",
    "one of the features of qcd which distinguishes it from traditional hadron physics is the fact that hadrons have interaction cross sections which fluctuate according to the size of its color dipole moment .",
    "thus valence fock states with small impact separation between the constituents will interact weakly and thus can transverse a nucleus with minimal interactions . at high energies the fock states of a hadron with small transverse size interact weakly even in a nuclear target because of their small dipole moment .",
    "this is the basis of `` color transparency '' in perturbative qcd  @xcite .",
    "the amplitude for the diffractive dissociation of a hadron into jets at high energies is given by a transverse momentum derivative of its light - front wavefunction , so it is possible to measure the wavefunctions of a relativistic hadron by diffractively dissociating it into jets whose momentum distribution is correlated with the valence quarks momenta @xcite .",
    "photon exchange measures a weighted sum of transverse derivatives @xmath55 and two - gluon exchange measures the second transverse partial derivative  @xcite .",
    "the diffractive dijet dissociation experiment e791 at fermilab using 500 gev incident pions on nuclear targets @xcite has recently provided a remarkable confirmation of color transparency and thus the gauge theory interactions predicted by qcd .",
    "the measured longitudinal momentum distribution of the jets @xcite is consistent with a pion light - front wavefunction of the pion with the shape of the asymptotic distribution amplitude , @xmath56 .",
    "data from cleo @xcite for the @xmath57 transition form factor also favor a form for the pion distribution amplitude close to the asymptotic solution to the perturbative qcd evolution equation @xcite .",
    "the new eva spectrometer experiment e850 at brookhaven  @xcite has also reported striking effects of color transparency in quasi - elastic large momentum transfer proton - proton scattering in nuclei which at large momentum transfer is controlled by proton fock states of small transverse size .",
    "the eva experiment also finds a breakdown of color transparency at @xmath58 gev and large @xmath59 , which may reflect effects of the charm threshold  @xcite .",
    "one can also express the matrix elements of the energy momentum tensor as overlap integrals of light - front wavefunctions  @xcite . an important consistency check of any relativistic formalism is to verify the vanishing of the anomalous gravito - magnetic moment @xmath60 , the spin - flip matrix element of the graviton coupling and analog of the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath61 .",
    "for example , at one - loop order in qed , @xmath62 for the electron when the graviton interacts with the fermion line , and @xmath63 when the graviton interacts with the exchanged photon .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath60 can be shown to be exact for bound or elementary systems in the light - front formalism  @xcite , in agreement with the equivalence principle  @xcite .",
    "the light - front formalism also provides a simple representation of angular momentum .",
    "see for example , refs .",
    "the projection @xmath64 is kinematical and is conserved separately for each fock component : each light - front fock wavefunction satisfies the sum rule : @xmath65 the sum over @xmath66 represents the contribution of the intrinsic spins of the @xmath8 fock state constituents .",
    "the sum over orbital angular momenta @xmath67 derives from the @xmath68 relative momenta .",
    "this excludes the contribution to the orbital angular momentum due to the motion of the center of mass , which is not an intrinsic property of the hadron  @xcite .",
    "the numerator structure of the light - front wavefunctions in @xmath69 is determined by the angular momentum constraints .",
    "the spin properties of light - front wavefunctions provides a consistent basis for analyzing spin correlations and azimuthal spin asymmetries in both exclusive and inclusive reactions .",
    "the higher fock states of the light hadrons describe the sea quark structure of the deep inelastic structure functions , including ",
    "intrinsic \" strangeness and charm fluctuations specific to the hadron s structure rather than gluon substructure @xcite .",
    "ladder relations connecting state of different particle number follow from the qcd equation of motion and lead to regge behavior of the quark and gluon distributions at @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "since the intrinsic heavy quarks tend to have the same rapidity as that of the projectile , they are produced at large @xmath71 in the beam fragmentation region .",
    "the charm structure function measured by the emc group shows an excess at large @xmath52 , indicating a probability of order @xmath72 for intrinsic charm in the proton  @xcite .",
    "the presence of intrinsic charm in light - mesons provides an explanation for the puzzle of the large @xmath73 branching ratio and suppressed @xmath74 decay  @xcite .",
    "the presence of intrinsic charm quarks in the @xmath39 wave function provides new mechanisms for @xmath39 decay .",
    "for example , chang and hou have considered the production of final states with three charmed quarks such as @xmath75 and @xmath76  @xcite ; these final states are difficult to realize in the valence model , yet they occur naturally when the @xmath77 quark of the intrinsic charm fock state @xmath78 decays via @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath80 spectrum for inclusive @xmath81 decays measured by cleo and belle shows a distinct enhancement at the low @xmath80 momentum where such decays would kinematically occur .",
    "alternatively , this excess could reflect the opening of baryonic channels such as @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "recently , susan gardner and i have shown that the presence of intrinsic charm in the hadrons light - front wave functions , even at a few percent level , provides new , competitive decay mechanisms for @xmath39 decays which are nominally ckm - suppressed  @xcite .",
    "for example , the weak decays of the @xmath39-meson to two - body exclusive states consisting of strange plus light hadrons , such as @xmath83 , are expected to be dominated by penguin contributions since the tree - level @xmath84 decay is ckm suppressed .",
    "however , higher fock states in the @xmath39 wave function containing charm quark pairs can mediate the decay via a ckm - favored @xmath85 tree - level transition . since they mimic the amplitude structure of `` charming '' penguin contributions  @xcite , charming penguins need not be penguins at all  @xcite .",
    "even without explicit solutions , many features of the light - front wavefunctions follow from general principles and its equation of motion , eq .",
    "( [ eq : feqm ] ) .",
    "every light - front fock wavefunction has the form : @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "much of the dynamical dependence of a light - front wavefunction is controlled by its light - cone energy denominator .",
    "the maximum of the wavefunction occurs when the invariant mass of the partons is minimal ; _ i.e. _ , when all particles have equal rapidity and are all at rest in the rest frame .",
    "in fact , dae sung hwang and i @xcite have noted that one can rewrite the wavefunction in the form : @xmath88}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the condition for minimal rapidity differences of the constituents .",
    "the key parameter is @xmath90 we can also interpret @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the effective binding energy .",
    "this form shows that the wavefunction is a quadratic form around its maximum , and that the width of the distribution in @xmath93 ( where the wavefunction falls to half of its maximum ) is controlled by @xmath94 and the transverse momenta @xmath95 .",
    "note also that the heaviest particles tend to have the largest @xmath96 and thus the largest momentum fraction of the particles in the fock state , a feature familiar from the intrinsic charm model .",
    "for example , the @xmath77 quark has the largest momentum fraction at small @xmath69 in the @xmath39 meson s valence light - front wavefunction , , but the distribution spreads out to an asymptotically symmetric distribution around @xmath97 when @xmath98    we can also discern some general properties of the numerator of the light - front wavefunctions .",
    "the transverse momentum dependence of @xmath100 guarantees @xmath64 conservation for each fock state : for example , one of the three light - front fock wavefunctions of a @xmath101 lepton in qed perturbation theory is @xmath102 where @xmath103 the orbital angular momentum projection in this case is @xmath104 the spin structure indicated by perturbative theory provides a template for the numerator structure of the light - front wavefunctions even for composite systems .",
    "the structure of the electron s fock state in perturbative qed shows that it is natural to have a negative contribution from relative orbital angular momentum which balances the @xmath105 of its photon constituents .",
    "we can also expect a significant orbital contribution to the proton s @xmath64 since gluons carry roughly half of the proton s momentum , thus providing insight into the  spin crisis \" in qcd .",
    "the fall - off the light - front wavefunctions at large @xmath69 and @xmath106 is dictated by qcd perturbation theory since the state is far - off the light - cone energy shell .",
    "this leads to counting rule behavior for the quark and gluon distributions at @xmath106 .",
    "notice that @xmath107 corresponds to @xmath108 for any constituent with nonzero mass or transverse momentum .",
    "explicit examples of light - front wavefunctions in qed are given in ref .",
    "the above discussion suggests that an approximate form for the hadron light - front wavefunctions might be constructed through variational principles and by minimizing the expectation value of @xmath109",
    "the light - front quantization of qcd in light - cone gauge has a number of advantages , including explicit unitarity , a physical fock expansion , the absence of faddeev - popov ghost terms , and the decoupling properties needed to prove factorization theorems in high momentum transfer inclusive and exclusive reactions .",
    "the light - front framework for gauge theory in light - cone gauge @xmath110 is a severely constrained dynamical theory with many second - class constraints  @xcite .",
    "these can be eliminated by constructing dirac brackets , and the theory can be quantized canonically by the correspondence principle in terms of a _ reduced number _ of independent fields . the commutation relations among the field operators can be found by the dirac method .",
    "a recent derivation of light - front quantized non - abelian gauge theory in light - cone gauge is given in ref .",
    "for example , the nondynamical projections of the fermion and gauge field can be eliminated using nonlocal constraint equations .",
    "the removal of the unphysical components of the fields results in tree - level instantaneous gluon exchange and fermion exchange interaction terms .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian of qcd can be expressed in a form resembling that of covariant theory with three- and four - point gauge interactions , except for the additional instantaneous four - point interactions which can be treated systematically .",
    "the light - front quantized free gauge theory simultaneously satisfies the covariant gauge condition @xmath111 as an operator condition as well as the light - cone gauge condition . in our analysis",
    "@xcite one imposes this condition linearly using a lagrange multiplier , rather than a quadratic form .",
    "the numerator of the gauge propagator is doubly transverse : @xmath112 with @xmath113 thus only physical degrees of freedom propagate .",
    "the remarkable properties of @xmath114 provide much simplification in the computations of loops . in the case of tree graphs ,",

    "the renormalization constants in the non - abelian theory can be shown to can be shown to satisfy the identity @xmath116 at one loop order , as expected in a theory with only physical gauge degrees of freedom .",

    "there are no faddeev - popov or gupta - bleuler ghost terms .",
    "bassetto , griguolo , and vian  @xcite have investigated the presence of multiple vacua and the use of new prescriptions for light - cone gauge . in previous work",
    "they showed that in two dimensions ( where no uv singularities occur ) , both the mandelstam - liebbrandt and principal value prescriptions for light - cone gauge are viable .",
    "in general they lead to different theories and to different results . since pure yang mills theory in 1 + 1 dimensions is exactly solvable by geometric techniques without even fixing a gauge , bassetto et al .",

    "van iersel , bakker , and pijlman @xcite have shown how one can obtain bound state solutions and explicit light - front wavefunctions for theories with simple ( 3 + 1 ) field theory interactions .",
    "as an example , they consider a system consisting of two scalar particles of equal mass @xmath138 exchanging a massless spinless particle , allowing for 2- and 3-particle fock states . the @xmath139 coupling strength is @xmath140 they solve the light - front bound state equation by making an expansion in basis functions  8 cubic spline functions for the functional dependence in @xmath141 and up to 3 jacobi polynomials in the transverse momenta .",
    "figure  [ fig : phi1000](d)-(e ) shows the valence wavefunctions of the first three bound states .",
    "it is interesting to see how the node structure appears in the light - cone fraction @xmath141 in the higher excited states .",
    "there are other possible approaches to non - perturbative qcd using light - front quantization .",
    "for example , one can construct trial wavefunctions for the light - front wavefunctions which incorporate ladder relations between fock states , angular momentum constraints , and perturbative qcd fall - off at high off - shell virtuality .",
    "the parameters would be determined variationally by minimizing the expectation value of @xmath142 lattice theory could also be adopted to light - cone coordinates @xmath143 rather than cartesian coordinates , thus incorporating the good lorentz boost properties of light - front quantization .",
    "light - cone quantization in light - cone gauge can be applied to the electroweak theory , including spontaneous symmetry breaking , thus providing a unitary as well as renormalizable theory of the standard model  @xcite .",
    "the light - front formalism can be used as an  event amplitude generator \" for high energy physics reactions where each particle s final state is completely labeled in momentum , helicity , and phase  @xcite .",
    "the application of the light - front time evolution operator @xmath144 to an initial state systematically generates the tree and virtual loop graphs of the @xmath145-matrix in light - front time - ordered perturbation theory in light - front gauge .",
    "renormalized amplitudes can be explicitly constructed by subtracting from the divergent loops amplitudes with nearly identical integrands corresponding to the contribution of the relevant mass and coupling counter terms ( the  alternating denominator method \" )  @xcite .    in the usual treatment of classical thermodynamics",
    ", one considers an ensemble of particles @xmath146 which have energies @xmath147 at a given  instant \" time @xmath148 .",
    "the partition function is defined as @xmath149 similarly , in quantum mechanics , one defines a quantum - statistical partition function as @xmath150 which sums over the exponentiated - weighted energy eigenvalues of the system . in the case of relativistic systems , it is natural to characterize the system at a given light - front time @xmath151 ; _ i.e. _ , one determines the state of each particle in the ensemble as its encounters the light - front .",
    "thus we can define a light - front partition function  @xcite @xmath152 by summing over the particles light - front energies @xmath153 .",
    "the total momentum is @xmath154 @xmath155 , and the total mass is defined from @xmath156 .",
    "the light - front partition function should be advantageous for analyzing relativistic systems such as heavy ion collisions , since , like true rapidity , @xmath157 light - front variables have simple behavior under lorentz boosts .",
    "the light - front formalism also takes into account the point that a phase transition does not occur simultaneously in @xmath148 , but propagates through the system with a finite wave velocity .",
    "there has been strong advances in light - cone physics , particularly in solving many formal problems of renormalization and implementation of spontaneous symmetry breaking within light - front quantized field theory .",
    "there have also been important new developments using light - cone methods in string theory and supersymmetry .",
    "the pauli - villars method has now emerged as a systematic way to regulate ultraviolet divergences in light - front quantized non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "the light - front formalism thus can provide a formalism for solving nonperturbative problems in qcd as rigorous as lattice gauge theory .    on the phenomenological side , the measurements from the fermilab e791 experiment of diffractive dijet production in pion - nucleus collisions",
    "has not only verified color transparency , but also given us a direct look at the light - front wavefunction of the pion .",
    "it will be important to extend these measurements to the diffractive dissociation of real and virtual photons , nucleons , and even light nuclei .",
    "the new applications of light - front wavefunctions to exclusive @xmath39 decays makes even more urgent the need for bound state solutions of the light - front hamiltonian for qcd in physical space - time dimensions .",
    "strong progress has been made solving model @xmath158 field theories using dlcq , light - front tamm - dancoff , effective light - front potential equations , and the dyson - schwinger approach .",
    "the transverse lattice method is now providing the first results for the pion distribution amplitude and the isgur - weis function for heavy hadron decays from qcd .",
    "variational methods also look promising . given these initial successes in ( 3 + 1 ) studies , we can be optimistic that with sufficient computational resources , first principle calculations of the spectrum and light - front wavefunctions of hadrons from light - front quantized qcd will soon emerge .",
