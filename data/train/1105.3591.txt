    "high purity germanium ( hpge ) detectors are extremely sensitive spectrometers , used to search for rare events , such as neutrinoless double beta decays or dark matter scattering off nuclei @xcite . in order to rule out the possibility of an inverted neutrino mass hierarchy , a neutrino with a majorana mass as low as 10 mev has to be excluded .",

    "an hpge based neutrinoless double beta decay experiment would need an active mass of @xmath8 1ton and a background level below 10@xmath0counts/(kgykev ) around the q - value of the double beta decay of @xmath9ge at 2039 kev .",

    "aluminum is refined from bauxite deposits that were predominantly formed by weathering @xcite during several periods in earth history .",
    "the currently mined deposits consist mainly of lateral sheets that have rested on or close to the surface for the past million years .",
    "the top - soil overburden above the bauxite layer is often negligible @xcite or has a thickness of less than a meter for major mining sites @xcite .",
    "the bauxite layers themselves are usually as thin as 2 m to 4 m @xcite .",
    "underground mines , exploiting pockets of bauxite , are mainly located in southern europe and hungary and have a small market share .",
    "the top soil above the bauxite layers of mining sites and the self shielding of the 2  4 m thick bauxite layers reduce the secondary cosmic ray flux and thus the cosmogenic activation of the aluminum yielding @xmath2al and @xmath1na . in order to account for the shielding by the top soil and the self shielding of the bauxite layer",
    ", a monte carlo simulation was performed .",
    "the mage @xcite framework based on geant4 @xcite was used .",
    "two scenarios , typical for major bauxite mining sites , were taken into account : a top soil free mining site ( like weipa , australia @xcite ) and a site with 1 m quartz sand overburden . the composition of the simulated bauxite was chosen according to the one reported for the weipa site @xcite .    for both scenarios , top soil free and 1 m top soil , the neutron and proton fluxes were simulated at different depths in the bauxite layer : for depths between 0 m and 0.5 m in steps of 0.1 m and for depths between 0.5 m and 2.0 m in steps of 0.5 m .",
    "the fluxes calculated for the different depths were averaged to obtain the mean neutron spectra for a bauxite layer with 2 m thickness with and without top soil .",
    "the spectra for neutrons and protons are shown in fig.[fig : neutron_fluxes ] and fig.[fig : proton_fluxes ] , respectively .",
    "the averaged spectra were used for calculating realistic @xmath2al and @xmath1na production rates within a 2 m bauxite layer .",
    "the calculated differential production rates of @xmath2al and @xmath1na for the previously described neutron and proton spectra at sea level and for different shielding scenarios are shown in fig.[fig:26alprod_rates_diff ] and fig.[fig:22naprod_rates_int ] , respectively .",
    "the production rate is significantly lower for the spectrum of @xcite than for the selected standard @xcite below 100mev .",
    "self shielding by a 2 m bauxite layer does reduce the differential production rates of @xmath2al and @xmath1na by a factor of roughly 410 with respect to the sea level production rate , depending on the neutron and proton energy .",
    "the integrated production rates of @xmath2al and @xmath1na are given in table [ tab : prod_rates ] .",
    "the reference neutron flux @xcite at sea level without overburden results in a production rate of 142 ( 56 ) @xmath2al ( @xmath1na ) nuclei per year and gram aluminum . the reduced neutron flux @xcite at sea level results in a production rate of roughly 80 ( 43 ) @xmath2al ( @xmath1na ) nuclei per gram aluminum per year .",
    "the higher production threshold of @xmath1na reduces this difference in the production rate of @xmath1na compared to the one of @xmath2al .",
    "the mean @xmath2al ( @xmath1na ) production rate due to the @xcite in a 2 m thick bauxite layer is 21 ( 11 ) @xmath2al ( @xmath1na ) nuclei per year and gram aluminum .",
    "if another 1 m of quartz sand overburden is assumed , the production rate through secondary neutrons drastically drops to 1.4 ( 1.0 ) @xmath2al ( @xmath1na ) nuclei per year and gram of aluminum .",
    "the expected production rate at sea level without overburden from protons is 17 ( 3 ) @xmath2al ( @xmath1na ) nuclei per gram aluminum per year .",
    "it becomes negligible if self shielding or an additional layer of top soil are taken into account .    in total in equilibrium in a 2 m bauxite layer without top soil",
    "23 @xmath2al decays per gram aluminum per year are expected . at sea in equilibrium",
    "65 @xmath1na decays are expected per gram aluminum per year .",
    "muon capture and spallation reactions induced by through - going muons can also lead to the production of @xmath2al and @xmath1na in quartz .",
    "the contribution due to this production channel at sea level is roughly 4% @xcite . as neutrons and protons",
    "are absorbed more efficiently in matter than muons , the fraction of @xmath2al and @xmath1na produced by negative muon capture and fast muons increases with increasing overburden .    to estimate the realistic contribution of the production rate due to muons , the production rates deeper inside the bauxite layer have to be considered .",
    "this was done for the case of no top soil and a 2 m thick bauxite layer .",
    "the density of bauxite is very sensitive to the grain size @xcite .",
    "it ranges between 1.3g/@xmath17 for fine grain up to 3.5g/@xmath17 for dense bauxite with a large quartz content .",
    "thus , a 2 m bauxite layer will correspond to 2.67meter water equivalent , mwe , depending on the mining site . at 2.6 mwe ( 7mwe )",
    "the contribution of muons to the @xmath2al production in quartz is 10%(75% ) @xcite . for deep bauxite layers with",
    "non negligible top soil , the production channel through muons will be dominating .",
    "for the case of shallow , low density bauxite mines , considered here , the production rate through muons is small .",
    "as there are already large uncertainties in the secondary neutron and proton fluxes , the muon contribution is neglected from now on .",
    "the isotope @xmath2al is a well known tracer for erosion rates in geology @xcite .",
    "the production rates of @xmath2al have mainly been measured in quartz samples . in glacially",
    "exposed surface layers , an average production rate of 374@xmath1628 @xmath2al nuclei per g quartz per year has been measured at an elevation of 3340 m @xcite .",
    "this can be translated into a production rate at sea level of 36.8@xmath162.7 ( stat . )",
    "@xmath2al nuclei per g quartz per year .",
    "this is in good agreement with recent measurements from @xcite .",
    "these measurements can be used to validate the calculation method used for production rates in bauxite .",
    "the excitation functions for @xmath2al in @xmath18si for neutrons are only available for energies between 25mev and 36mev @xcite . at higher energies ,",
    "only proton excitation functions are available @xcite .",
    "as the measured neutron @xcite and proton @xcite cross - sections are in very good agreement at energies between 25mev and 35mev , it can be assumed that the neutron excitation function is about equal to the measured proton excitation function at all energies . at high energies , excitation functions for neutrons and protons",
    "are in general expected to be the same due to isospin symmetry .    using a polynomial fit to the excitation function @xcite and the unshielded neutron ( proton ) spectrum at sea level from @xcite ( @xcite ) , a @xmath2al production rate in quartz at sea level of 44 ( 6 ) nuclei per gram quartz",
    "is expected .",
    "considering the large uncertainties in the secondary cosmic ray flux variations with geographic location and the uncertainties in the exposure histories of the measured samples , this is in good agreement with the experimental values .",
    "the good agreement between calculation and measurement shows that the method to estimate the activities of @xmath2al and @xmath1na in bauxite samples can be trusted to roughly a factor of two .",
    "the contamination of any sample of aluminum depends on its history .",
    "equilibrium between production rate and decay of an isotope will be reached after a few half lives .",
    "this is the case after a few million ( ten ) years for @xmath2al ( @xmath1na ) . for the case of a 2 m bauxite layer without top soil , in equilibrium",
    "a @xmath2al activity of 23 decays per year is expected per gram aluminum , see table [ tab : prod_rates ] .",
    "the contamination with @xmath2al is not affected by the refining process .",
    "the expected equilibrium activity for a 2 m bauxite deposit without top soil is 0.8mbq / kg .",
    "for ease of scaling , an activity of 1.0mbq / kg was used for the background estimates . due to its long half life , the background from @xmath2al is constant during any experiment .",
    "the contamination with @xmath1na is eliminated effectively during the refining process .",
    "thus for @xmath1na it is the exposure history after aluminum refinement that determines its activity .",
    "after one half life ( 2.6 years ) of exposure to cosmic rays , the decay rate is equal to half of the production rate . for no overburden at sea level , this corresponds to 1.0mbq / kg . this value was assumed to estimate backgrounds . for underground experiments ,",
    "the @xmath1na activity decreases significantly after a few years .",
    "significant @xmath4th contaminations of the order of mbq / kg have been measured in ulb aluminum . for the background estimate , 1.0mbq /",
    "kg @xmath4th and @xmath3ra activities were assumed .    typically , the thickness of the metalization on hpge detectors is around 300 nm .",
    "thus for a typical detector with 7.0 cm height and 7.5 cm diameter , roughly @xmath19 of aluminum are deposited on the detector surface .",
    "taking the production rates expected from the neutron flux from @xcite , roughly 159 decays / g@xmath200.0134g@xmath82.1 @xmath2al decays per detector per year and 28 decays / g@xmath21 0.0134g@xmath80.4 @xmath1na decays per detector per year are expected .",
    "a monte carlo simulation of 25.2@xmath22@xmath1na , @xmath2al and @xmath4th decays each , was performed . the mage @xcite framework based on geant4 @xcite",
    "was used to simulate an array of true coaxial hpge detectors corresponding to a nominal phase ii arrangement of gerda @xcite . the array consisted of seven strings with three detectors each , with the strings being aligned at the same height .",
    "the configuration had hexagonal closest packing with a closest radial distance of 15 mm between the detector surfaces .",
    "the distance in height between the detector boundaries was 60 mm .",
    "all detectors were true coaxial n - type 18-fold segmented with 75 mm diameter and 70 mm height and a bore hole diameter of 10 mm @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1na , @xmath2al , @xmath3ra and @xmath4th contaminations were simulated as being randomly distributed on the metalized surfaces of all detectors .",
    "the results of the simulation are listed in table [ tab : sim_background_rates ] .",
    "background events induced by photon interactions can be identified through the event topologies by requiring the energy to be deposited in a single detector or in case of segmented detectors a single segment @xcite .",
    "applying single segment cuts compared to single detector cuts can reduce the background in the region of interest by typically an order of magnitude , depending on the background source .",
    "the simulated spectra , normalized to the expected number of decays per year and kilogram of germanium , without any cut , with single detector cut and with single segment cut are shown in figs .",

    "gives the tolerable activity of the considered nuclide to restrict the background to 10@xmath23 counts/(kgykev ) with single segment cut applied .",
    "while for @xmath1na an activity of a few mbq / kg can be tolerated , the restrictions on @xmath2al , @xmath3ra and @xmath4th contaminations are more sever at the hundreds of @xmath24bq / kg level .",
    "the resulting spectra in the energy window between 1940  kev and 2140  kev are shown in the insets of figs.[fig : simulated_22na ] , [ fig : simulated_26al ] , [ fig : simulated_226ra ] and [ fig : simulated_232th ] .",
    "for @xmath2al , the background rate in the region of interest is approximately constant . a background rate of up to 0.17@xmath25counts/(kgykev ) is expected for a single segment cut .",
    "the background expected from @xmath1na is @xmath82.6@xmath2110@xmath26 counts/(kgykev ) and thus less critical .",
    "the contribution due to a 1.0mbq / kg @xmath4th contamination is expected to be 0.5@xmath25counts/(kgykev ) , while for @xmath3ra it is 0.26@xmath25 counts/(kgykev ) .",
    "if no cut based on event topologies is made , the background rate is higher by roughly one order of magnitude . in this case",
    "the background will be at levels of up to @xmath27counts/(kgykev ) .",
    "a single detector cut reduces the backgrounds due to the decays of @xmath1na and @xmath2al by factors of 1.4 and 3.2 , respectively .",
    "a single segment gives suppression factors of 10 and 30 for @xmath1na and @xmath2al , respectively .",
    "for @xmath3ra and @xmath4th , the single segment cut gives only suppression factors of 2.6 and4.5 , respectively .",
    "measurements of five different ulb aluminum samples were performed .",
    "all measurements were done to qualify low background aluminum for its use in low background detectors .",
    "the measurements of the samples were carried out at the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ( lngs ) using the gempi @xcite and gecris @xcite detectors .",
    "details of the samples and measured activities or limits are listed in table [ tab : measured_rates ] .",
    "some of these results were published earlier @xcite .",
    "three of the five samples show a non zero @xmath2al activity .",
    "the activities lie in the range of 0.20.6mbq / kg . this translates into 6.318.9 @xmath2al decays per year per gram aluminum .",
    "the highest measured activity of 0.6mbq / kg of the kryal # 1 sample , see table [ tab : measured_rates ] , is close to the one calculated for a 2 m bauxite layer without top soil .",
    "however , for the kryal # 2 sample , an upper limit of @xmath280.26mbq / kg was established .",
    "it is remarkable that the @xmath2al activities of the five samples differ so significantly .",
    "this indicates that the bauxite used for the production of the ulb aluminum was mined at sites with different top soil overburden or with different bauxite layer thicknesses or histories .",
    "it also shows that some of the commercially available bauxite must have originated from mines with no top soil overburden and shallow bauxite layers .",
    "one of the samples shows a @xmath1na activity of 0.7@xmath160.3mbq / kg corresponding to 22@xmath169@xmath1na decays per gram aluminum per year .",
    "this is in very good agreement with the assumption of exposure of the ulb aluminum to sea level secondary cosmic rays for about two years before the screening measurement . alternatively",
    "the sample could have been exposed to increased cosmic radiation by air transport .    in some of the ulb aluminum samples , also @xmath3ra or @xmath4th activities",
    "were measured . in all cases",
    "the @xmath4ra activity was considerably lower than the @xmath4th activity , suggesting that the @xmath29th chain was not in secular equilibrium .",
    "it is not clear , whether @xmath4th ( and possibly @xmath29th ) stems from initial contaminations of the bauxite or from impurities introduced to the ulb aluminum during the refining process .",
    "the detailed geological history of a given mining site determines the exposure of the bauxite to neutrons and protons .",
    "therefore , the source of the aluminum has to be controlled and the aluminum used has to be screened for radio - impurities with sufficient sensitivity .",
    "the contamination with @xmath2al can be avoided by using aluminum refined from underground bauxite deposits .",
    "the contamination with @xmath1na has to be avoided by restricting the time of the aluminum stored above ground .",
    "the calculations show that the background induced by @xmath2al , @xmath3ra , @xmath4th and to a lesser extent @xmath1na in the metalization can be significant , if proper care is not taken .",
    "@xmath2al has been measured in some ulb aluminum samples with activities consistent with the prediction of the calculations taking into account a 2 m thick bauxite layer without or with very little top soil . in one of the ulb aluminum samples @xmath1na",
    "was found with an activity consistent with two years of sea level exposure to cosmic rays .",
    "the simulations show that for neutrinoless double beta decay experiments using hpge detectors with metalization , the material used to metallize the surfaces has to be carefully screened for radio - impurities . for the case of n - type hpge detectors with a diameter of 7.5 cm and a height of 7.0 cm , maximal radio - impurities of less than 0.6mbq / kg , 3.3mbq / kg ,",
    "0.2mbq / kg and 0.2mbq / kg are required in order not to exceed individual background contributions of larger than 10@xmath23counts/(kgykev ) from @xmath1na , @xmath2al , @xmath3ra and @xmath4th , respectively .",
    "ulb hpge detectors with the sensitivity required to test ulb aluminum with this sensitivity are available @xcite .    in order to avoid dangerous radio - impurities",
    ", the aluminum for the next generation neutrinoless double beta - decay experiments has to be produced from bauxite from mines with sufficient top soil overburden .",
    "otherwise , the cosmogenically produced isotope @xmath2al will create a background level limiting the sensitivity of the experiment .",
