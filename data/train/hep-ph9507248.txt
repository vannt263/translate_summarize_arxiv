    "inclusive @xmath1 decay is very sensitive to physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) @xcite . as any flavor changing neutral current process",
    ", it can only arise at one - loop level in the sm , and therefore possible new physics can yield comparable contributions . as the recent cleo measurement @xcite excludes large deviations from the sm ,",
    "a next - to - leading order calculation is essential .",
    "the absence of such a calculation will soon become the major obstacle in improving the bounds on new physics from this process .",
    "certain parts of this computation have already been carried out @xcite , but the technically most challenging parts are yet to be calculated .",
    "it was observed recently @xcite that moments of the photon spectrum can be predicted to order @xmath0 accuracy by knowing the coefficients of the effective hamiltonian only to the presently available leading logarithmic accuracy .",
    "this will provide a model independent determination of the @xmath9 quark pole mass ( see also @xcite ) , that is , the @xmath10 and @xmath11 matrix elements of the heavy quark effective theory .    in this paper",
    "we point out that part of the next - to - leading order correction to the photon spectrum induced by the @xmath8 operator is enhanced by @xmath2 .",
    "we describe these contributions in section ii . in section iii",
    "we resum the series of leading logarithms of the form @xmath3^n$ ] .",
    "we discuss the meaning of the infrared scale @xmath12 and how nonperturbative phenomena enter the results .",
    "the resummation of leading logarithms does not eliminate the logarithmic dependence on the @xmath9 quark mass , which formally cancels the @xmath0 suppression of this term . in section",
    "iv we discuss possible phenomenological implications .",
    "in the standard model , @xmath1 decay is mediated by penguin diagrams .",
    "qcd corrections to this process form a power series in the parameter @xmath13 , which is too large to provide a reliable expansion .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to integrate out the virtual top quark and @xmath14 boson effects ( and possible new physics ) at the @xmath14 scale , and sum up the large logarithms using the operator product expansion and the renormalization group .",
    "we work with the operator basis and effective hamiltonian of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath15 for the present paper only two of these operators are directly relevant @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 are color indices , and @xmath19 .",
    "throughout our discussion @xmath20 and @xmath7 will refer to the  effective \" wilson coefficients @xcite that include the leading order contribution of the four quark operators .",
    "we are interested in the order @xmath0 correction proportional to @xmath21 , which is the order @xmath22 corrections to @xmath23 .",

    "the extra factor of 9 suppression in eq .",
    "( [ spect88 ] ) results from the square of the @xmath9 or @xmath5 quark s electric charge .",
    "this contribution to the total @xmath1 decay rate is infinite .",
    "the divergence is canceled by the virtual correction to the @xmath23 decay mode ( with no photon in the final state ) .",
    "while soft photons could be summed to all orders in @xmath22 to make the @xmath32 limit smooth , in finite orders of perturbation theory , it only makes sense to talk about the total inclusive @xmath1 decay rate with an explicit lower cut - off on the photon energy .    the more interesting feature of the spectrum in eq .",
    "( [ spect88 ] ) is that it is not finite in the @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) limit . in particular , the photon spectrum calculated in dimensional regularization with vanishing light quark masses",
    "would contain a part proportional to @xmath35 for any value of @xmath36 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that a massless quark can not be distinguished from the same massless quark and one ( or more ) collinear massless partons with the same total charge and energy .",
    "the singularity is eliminated once a nonzero quark mass is included , but it results in the above logarithmic dependence of the spectrum on @xmath37 .",
    "pictorially , this is simplest to understand by looking at the dalitz plot in the @xmath34 limit ( in the @xmath38 variables ) , shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the shaded area represents the available phase space , the thick line denotes where collinear singularities occur , and the black box indicates where the virtual corrections contribute .",
    "1/a corresponds to the square of the invariant matrix element of @xmath28 . in this case",
    "both the collinear singularity and the virtual correction occur at @xmath39 .",
    "for this contribution , there is no problem whatsoever carrying out the calculation in the @xmath40 limit .",
    "the reason is that the kinematic variable @xmath41 regularizes all singularities , and one finds the usual picture of sudakov exponentiation near @xmath39 .",
    "however , the situation is more complicated for the contribution of the square of the invariant matrix element of @xmath42 , shown in fig .",
    "1/b . in this case ,",
    "collinear singularities occur at any value of @xmath36 ; these are only canceled by the singular part of the virtual correction in the total decay rate , but not in the photon spectrum .",
    "if the hadronic final state @xmath43 formed a jet , by excluding photons within a certain angular cut around the jet axis , the above discussed collinear singularity would be eliminated . however , at cleo @xmath44 meson decay products are distributed in angle .",
    "thus , when the experimental analysis excludes events in which a photon and a charged particle overlap in the detector , this cut is not related to the direction of the decay product @xmath5 quark at short distances .",
    "to identify the origin of the leading logarithms of the form @xmath3^n$ ] , and to resum them to all orders , we observe that the analytic structure and @xmath37-dependence of the @xmath42 contribution is very similar to the photon structure function , as discussed in @xcite . in the latter case one",
    "is interested in a hard photon scattering off another ( almost ) on - shell photon , while in the present problem an on - shell photon is created in the decay of a heavy particle .",
    "we work to fixed ( first ) order in @xmath22 and to all orders in @xmath0 .",
    "it is simplest to consider the discontinuity of the forward scattering amplitude corresponding to intermediate states with an @xmath5 quark , a photon , and any number of light quarks ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath5 ) and gluons . in an axial gauge",
    "the leading logarithms come from those diagrams in which at order @xmath47 there are precisely @xmath48 ways of separating the external photon legs from the other external legs by cutting two internal lines ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the result is given by the sum of two sets of ladder diagrams .",
    "one corresponds to the decay function of the @xmath5 quark into a photon , and the other to that of the gluon .",
    "this second set of ladder diagrams starts only at order @xmath4 , but also yields leading logs . from these arguments",
    "it also follows that only the square of the @xmath42 operator s invariant matrix element can yield these type of leading logs .",
    "decay functions are typically not calculable from first principles ; moreover , they are usually divergent in perturbation theory . as the photon only couples to massive partons ( quarks ) , in a perturbative calculation the light quark masses provide an infrared cut - off .",
    "that is why eq .",
    "( [ spect88 ] ) in the previous section contains a logarithmic dependence on @xmath49 .",
    "higher order corrections would also include terms proportional to @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "however , in real qcd there is no such dependence on the light quark masses .",
    "non - perturbative decay functions are well - defined , measurable physical quantities .    the crucial observation of ref .",
    "@xcite was that for a parton interacting with an on - shell photon , the absolute normalization of the leading logarithms can be calculated in perturbative qcd .",
    "( in other cases only the @xmath52 evolution is calculable . )",
    "this large @xmath52 ( or large @xmath53 ) behavior is determined by the matrix element of the photon operators between the external photon states .",
    "the contributions of quark and gluon operators are logarithmically suppressed . to sum the leading log ladders ,",
    "one introduces an infrared scale @xmath12 , which is appropriately chosen to be a few times @xmath54 .",
    "the question of the @xmath12-dependence is then non - leading in @xmath55 . addressing it consistently involves a combination of perturbative and non - perturbative ( _ i.e. _ , decay functions deduced from other experiments ) terms of comparable magnitudes .",
    "all strongly coupled long distance effects are absorbed into the definitions of the decay functions .",
    "the resummation of these leading logarithms is important , since @xmath56 implies @xmath57 . only in this limit",
    "can inclusive decay rates be calculated model - independently , based on an operator product expansion @xcite .",

    "the @xmath65 and the @xmath66 s are related to the anomalous dimension matrix of the quark and gluon operators @xcite .    in the absence of qcd , @xmath67/x$ ] and @xmath68 . substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ resm ] ) , we recover the singular ( in the @xmath34 limit ) part of the order @xmath69 result discussed in section ii . the relevant part of eq .",
    "( [ spect88 ] ) is , as promised , @xmath70 it is not important that the @xmath71 limit of eq .",
    "( [ spect88 ] ) is zero , while that of eq .",
    "( [ sing88 ] ) is not .",
    "the resummed photon spectrum vanishes at @xmath72 anyway .",
    "away from @xmath72 the resummation of the leading logarithms yields finite , non - zero corrections .",
    "although the gluon fragmentation into a photon starts only at order @xmath4 , its contribution for not too large photon energies is comparable to that of the @xmath5 quark .",
    "the photon spectrum can be reconstructed from the moments in eq .",
    "( [ moments ] ) by inverse mellin transformation .",
    "we use three flavors in the anomalous dimension matrix , as charm quarks are excluded from the final state in the experimental analysis .",
    "the sensitivity of the result to the number of flavors in the @xmath18-function ( three or four ) is numerically very small .",
    "the @xmath73 term , being proportional to the square of the quark charges , would be substantially bigger if charm were not excluded .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "the ratio of the resummed @xmath74 contribution to the photon spectrum divided by eq .",
    "( [ sing88 ] ) . for not too small values of the photon energy",
    "the resummation suppresses the photon spectrum .",
    "however , this suppression is not very strong ; it only exceeds a factor of two for about @xmath75 .",
    "( the spectrum is enhanced for @xmath76 . )",
    "while we think the observations above are interesting even purely from a theoretical point of view , we would like to discuss whether there are any experimental implications .",
    "although enhanced by @xmath77 , the @xmath74 term discussed in this paper can not become arbitrarily large as compared to @xmath78 .",
    "the reason is that in the large @xmath79 limit the running of @xmath80 cancels the logarithmic enhancement . for a fixed value of @xmath79 the @xmath81 limit",
    "is not allowed . on the one hand , it is cut off by nonperturbative effects ; on the other hand , the uncalculable parts of the fragmentation functions can be absorbed in @xmath12 , as long as @xmath12 is of order @xmath54 .",
    "beyond perturbation theory , the @xmath82 term of the order @xmath69 result should be understood as @xmath77 , where @xmath12 is some scale of order @xmath54 .",
    "thus , it is also obvious that a measurement of the @xmath74 contribution would not be sensitive to the strange quark mass .",
    "for our numerical estimates we use @xmath83 and @xmath84 , corresponding to @xmath85gev and @xmath86 .",
    "we also adopt @xmath87gev and @xmath88gev . the @xmath74 contribution to the energy region relevant for cleo",
    "turns out to be negligible .",
    "the reason is mainly the overall @xmath89 suppression . on the other hand ,",
    "any process that contributes to @xmath44 decays also contributes to @xmath90 via the fragmentation of any of the decay product partons into a photon .",
    "we estimate that the tree - level @xmath14-mediated decay @xmath91 constitutes of order 1% background to one of the cleo analyses that does not reconstruct a kaon .",
    "this effect becomes more significant and needs to be taken into account more precisely for any future measurements of the @xmath92 decay that aim at measuring @xmath93 .",
    "the @xmath74 contribution , however , dominates the photon spectrum below about @xmath94gev . measuring the inclusive @xmath1 spectrum at such low photon energies",
    "will probably remain impossible at cleo .",
    "the situation may be better at asymmetric @xmath44 factories @xcite .",
    "but even if such a measurement is possible in a bin around @xmath6gev ( say , @xmath95 , that corresponds to roughly @xmath96gev ) , the @xmath1 branching fraction into this bin is about @xmath97 . taking into account expected experimental efficiencies for such an analysis ,",
    "probably only a handful of events can be detected ( assuming @xmath98 @xmath44 s ) .",
    "the reward for this rather hard experimental analysis would be a theoretically clean determination of @xmath7 .    in conclusion",
    ", we pointed out that a part of the next - to - leading order result for the inclusive @xmath1 decay rate is proportional to @xmath99 . summing the leading logarithms of the form @xmath3^n$ ] to all orders in perturbation theory",
    "suppresses ( enhances ) this contribution to the photon spectrum for large ( small ) values of the photon energy . in the large @xmath79 limit ,",
    "formally , the logarithmic factor cancels the @xmath0 suppression of the @xmath74 contribution , as compared to the leading order result @xmath78 .",
