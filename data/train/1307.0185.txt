    "the statistical analysis and reliable interpretation of stochastic processes have become indispensable tools in fields as different as non - equilibrium statistical physics , biophysics , geophysics , ecology and finances .",
    "examples range from random trajectories of individual tracers in living cells @xcite to market stock prices @xcite .",
    "the acquired trajectories are often unique , either due to the challenges in reconducting an experiment or reproducing the identical experimental conditions ( e.g. , in living cells ) , or due to the intrinsic uniqueness of the phenomenon ( e.g. , stock prices ) . in both cases , a single realization of the stochastic process has to be analyzed . although the problem of optimal inferences has been thoroughly studied in statistics for a long time , none of various statistical tools is known to be universally the `` best '' . for instance , the maximum likelihood estimators are known to be ( nearly ) optimal but their implementation may be too time - consuming or impractical under certain circumstances . in turn , a much simpler tool of the time averaged ( ta ) mean square displacement ( msd ) which is broadly used by experimentalists , may be biased or strongly non - optimal .",
    "the presence of localization errors , blurring , electronic noises and other acquisition artifacts may strongly alter the inferred parameters @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the search for optimal inferences is still active , even for simple and well studied processes such as , e.g. , brownian motion @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a discrete gaussian process of @xmath0 steps , i.e. , a gaussian vector @xmath1 , which is determined by given mean vector @xmath2 and covariance matrix @xmath3 .",
    "in general , the mean vector and the covariance matrix are not known and have to be inferred from random realizations of the process .",
    "such an inference of @xmath4 unknowns is obviously impossible from a single realization of @xmath0 random points @xmath5 . in many cases ,",
    "however , the structure of the mean vector and/or the covariance matrix is expected .",
    "for instance , one - dimensional discrete brownian motion ( or off - lattice random walk ) with a constant drift is defined by setting @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the starting point , @xmath9 is the drift over one step ( i.e. , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the step duration and @xmath12 the velocity ) , and @xmath13 is the one step variance ( which is related to the diffusion coefficient @xmath14 as @xmath15 ) . choosing a particular class of processes ( i.e. , choosing the structure for @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , one significantly reduces the number of unknowns , making the inference from a single realization tractable . for instance , only three parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath16 have to be inferred in the above example .",
    "many standard estimators employed for the analysis of single - particle trajectories operate with quadratic forms , @xmath17 , defined by a convenient symmetric matrix @xmath18 .",

    "how can one choose between them ?",
    "what is the `` best '' quadratic form to infer the parameters of a known stochastic process ? the answers to these questions strongly depend on the studied process and on the chosen optimality criterion .    inspired by these questions ,",
    "we consider here a more specific problem of finding the `` optimal '' symmetric matrix @xmath19 that would minimize the variance @xmath20 ( or another cumulant moment @xmath21 ) of the quadratic form @xmath22 , under the constraint for the mean value @xmath23 of @xmath22 to be fixed . in @xcite",

    "this results agrees with the general cramr - rao lower bound which is achieved by the ta msd with the unit lag time @xcite .",
    "moreover , this optimal choice minimizes simultaneously _ all _ cumulant moments @xmath21 with @xmath30 .    in this paper , we extend this analysis to discrete non - centered gaussian processes , for instance , in the presence of drift .",
    "we construct the optimal symmetric matrix @xmath19 for given mean vector @xmath2 and covariance matrix @xmath3 .",
    "we also derive a simple explicit formula for the smallest achievable cumulant moment that may serve as a quality benchmark for other quadratic forms .",
    "in particular , we compare the optimal matrix @xmath19 ( which depends on both @xmath3 and @xmath2 ) , to a sub - optimal matrix @xmath31 which is independent of @xmath2 and thus more robust against uncertainties in @xmath2 ( which is often unknown or difficult to estimate accurately ) .",
    "we show that the variance ( or higher cumulant moments ) increases by a small amount when the sub - optimal matrix is used .",
    "finally , we compare the optimal matrix to the standard quadratic estimators : ta msd and ta vacf .",
