    "the dehn function is a geometric invariant of a space ( typically , a riemannian manifold or a simplicial complex ) which measures the difficulty of filling closed curves with discs .",
    "this can be made into a group invariant by defining the dehn function of a group to be the dehn function of a space on which the group acts cocompactly and properly discontinuously .",
    "the choice of space affects the dehn function , but its rate of growth depends solely on the group .",
    "indeed , it depends solely on the quasi - isometry class of the group",
    ".    a small dehn function can have various geometric implications .",
    "in particular , a group with a dehn function growing slower than @xmath3 must be hyperbolic ; indeed , a group is hyperbolic if and only if its dehn function grows linearly @xcite .",
    "the connectedness of the asymptotic cone is also related to the growth of the dehn function ; any asymptotic cone of a group with quadratic dehn function is simply connected , and conversely , if all asymptotic cones of a group are simply connected , its dehn function is bounded by a polynomial @xcite@xcite .",
    "one widely - studied family of groups is the set of lattices @xmath4 in semisimple lie groups @xmath5 .",
    "the dehn function of a cocompact lattice is easy to find ; such a lattice acts on a non - positively curved symmetric space @xmath6 , and this non - positive curvature gives rise to a linear or quadratic dehn function , depending on the rank of the space .",
    "non - cocompact lattices have more complicated behavior .",
    "the key difference is that if the lattice is not cocompact , it acts cocompactly on a subset of @xmath6 rather than the whole thing , and this subset has different geometry .    in the case",
    "that @xmath4 has @xmath7-rank 1 , the dehn function is almost completely understood , and depends primarily on the @xmath8-rank of @xmath5 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath4 acts cocompactly on a space consisting of @xmath6 with infinitely many disjoint horoballs removed .",
    "when @xmath5 has @xmath8-rank 1 , the boundaries of these horoballs correspond to nilpotent groups , and the lattice is hyperbolic relative to these nilpotent groups .",
    "the dehn function of the lattice is thus equal to that of the nilpotent groups , and gromov showed that unless @xmath6 is the complex , quaternionic , or cayley hyperbolic plane , the dehn function is at most quadratic @xcite .",
    "if @xmath6 is the complex or quaternionic hyperbolic plane , the dehn function is cubic @xcite ; if @xmath6 is the cayley hyperbolic plane , the precise growth rate is unknown , but is at most cubic .    when @xmath5 has @xmath8-rank 2 and @xmath4 has @xmath7-rank 1 or 2 , leuzinger and pittet @xcite proved that the dehn function grows exponentially .",
    "as in the @xmath8-rank 1 case , the proof relies on understanding the subgroups corresponding to the removed horoballs , but in this case the subgroups are solvable and have exponential dehn function . finally , when @xmath5 has @xmath8-rank 3 or greater and @xmath4 has @xmath7-rank 1 , drutu @xcite has shown that the boundary of a horoball satisfies a quadratic filling inequality and that @xmath4 enjoys an `` asymptotically quadratic '' dehn function , i.e. , its dehn function is bounded by @xmath9 for any @xmath10 .",
    "when @xmath4 has @xmath7-rank larger than @xmath11 , the geometry of the space becomes more complicated .",
    "the main difference is that the removed horoballs are no longer disjoint , so many of the previous arguments fail . in many cases ,",
    "the best known result is due to gromov , who sketched a proof that the dehn function of @xmath4 is bounded above by an exponential function @xcite .",
    "a full proof of this fact was given by leuzinger @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we consider @xmath1 .",
    "this is a lattice with @xmath7-rank @xmath12 in a group with @xmath8-rank @xmath12 , so when @xmath13 is small , the methods above apply .",
    "when @xmath14 , the group @xmath15 is virtually free , and thus hyperbolic . as a consequence , its dehn function is linear .",
    "when @xmath16 , the result of leuzinger and pittet mentioned above implies that the dehn function of @xmath17 grows exponentially ; this was first proved by epstein and thurston @xcite .",
    "this exponential growth has applications to finiteness properties of arithmetic groups as well ; bux and wortman @xcite describe a way that the constructions in @xcite lead to a proof that @xmath18)$ ] is not finitely presented , then generalize to a large class of lattices in reductive groups over function fields .",
    "much less is known about the dehn function for lattices in @xmath1 when @xmath19 . by the results of gromov and leuzinger above",
    ", the dehn function of any such lattice is bounded by an exponential function , but thurston ( see @xcite ) conjectured that    when @xmath19 , @xmath1 has a quadratic dehn function .",
    "this is a special case of a conjecture of gromov that lattices in symmetric spaces with @xmath8-rank at least 3 have polynomial dehn functions .    in this paper",
    ", we will prove thurston s conjecture when @xmath0 :    [ thm : mainthm ] when @xmath0 , @xmath1 has a quadratic dehn function .    the basic idea of the proof of theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] is to use fillings of curves in the symmetric space @xmath20 as templates for fillings of words in @xmath21 .",
    "fillings which lie in the thick part of @xmath20 correspond directly to fillings in @xmath21 , but in general , an optimal filling of a curve in the thick part may have to go deep into the cusp of @xmath22 .",
    "regions of this cusp correspond to parabolic subgroups of @xmath21 , so our first step is to develop geometric techniques to cut the filling into pieces which each lie in one such region .",
    "this reduces the problem of filling the original word to the problem of filling words in parabolic subgroups of @xmath4 .",
    "we fill these words using combinatorial techniques , especially the fact that @xmath4 contains many overlapping solvable subgroups .",
    "some of the ideas in this work were inspired by discussions at the american institute of mathematics workshop , `` the isoperimetric inequality for @xmath1 , '' and the author would like to thank the organizers , nathan broaddus , tim riley , and kevin wortman ; and participants , especially mladen bestvina , alex eskin , martin kassabov , and christophe pittet . the author would also like to thank tim riley , yves de cornulier , kevin wortman , and mladen bestvina for many helpful conversations while the author was visiting bristol university , universit de rennes , and university of utah .",
    "finally , the author would like to thank new york university for its hospitality during part of the preparation of this paper .",
    "in this section , we will give some preliminaries on the geometry of @xmath1 .",

    "if @xmath34 is a word , we call @xmath35 its length .",
    "we denote the set of words in @xmath32 by @xmath36 , and if @xmath37 , we let @xmath38 be their concatenation . we denote the empty word by @xmath39 .",
    "when @xmath32 is a generating set for @xmath5 , there is a natural evaluation map from @xmath36 to @xmath5 , and we say that a word _ represents _ the corresponding group element .",
    "a word @xmath40 in @xmath32 corresponds to a path in the cayley graph of @xmath5 with respect to @xmath32 .",
    "this path connects @xmath41 ( the identity element ) to the element that @xmath40 represents , and if @xmath40 is reduced , the path does not double back on itself .",
    "simplicial paths in the cayley graph which start at @xmath41 are in bijective correspondence with words in @xmath32 .",
    "there is also an approximate version of this correspondence for some group actions on complexes or manifolds .",
    "let @xmath6 be a simplicial complex or riemannian manifold and let @xmath5 act on @xmath6 ( by maps of simplicial complexes or by isometries , respectively ) .",

    "the word problem is combinatorial , but the correspondence between words and curves allows us to work with the dehn function from either a combinatorial or a geometric perspective .",
    "if @xmath62 is a finitely presented group , we can let @xmath63 and consider words in @xmath64 .",
    "if a word @xmath40 represents the identity , then there is a way to prove this using the relations .",
    "that is , there is a sequence of steps which reduces @xmath40 to the empty word , where each step is a free expansion ( insertion of a subword @xmath65 ) , free reduction ( deletion of a subword @xmath65 ) , or the application of a relator ( insertion or deletion of one of the @xmath66 ) .",
    "we call the number of applications of relators in a sequence its _ cost _ , and we call the minimum cost of a sequence which starts at @xmath40 and ending at @xmath39 the _ filling area _ of @xmath40 , denoted by @xmath67 .",
    "we then define the _ dehn function _ of @xmath68 to be @xmath69 where @xmath70 represents the length of @xmath40 as a word and the maximum is taken over words representing the identity .",
    "this depends _ a priori _ on the chosen presentation of @xmath68 ; we will see that the growth rate of @xmath71 is independent of this choice . for convenience ,",
    "if @xmath72 are two words representing the same element of @xmath68 , we define @xmath73 ; this is the minimum cost to transform @xmath74 to @xmath40 .",

    "more generally , if @xmath6 is a riemannian manifold or simplicial complex , we can define the filling area @xmath79 of a lipschitz curve @xmath80 to be the infimal area of a lipschitz map @xmath81 which extends @xmath82 .",
