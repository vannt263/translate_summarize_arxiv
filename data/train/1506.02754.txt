    "the collective behavior of systems containing active particles have gained extensive attention in recent years due to its great importance both from a fundamental physics perspective and for understanding many biological systems@xcite . a wealth of new nonequilibrium phenomena",
    "have been reported , such as active swarming , large scale vortex formation@xcite , phase separation@xcite , etc , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "recently , a new trend in this field has been the dynamics of dense assemblies of self - propelled particles around glass transition .",
    "experiments on crowded systems of active colloids and active cells show dynamic features such as jamming and dynamic arrest that are very similar to those observed in glassy materials @xcite .",
    "computer simulations demonstrated that nonequilibrium glass transition or dynamic arrest behavior does occur in a dense suspension of self - propelled hard spheres , where the critical density for glass transition shifts to larger value with increasing activity@xcite .",
    "starting from a generalized langevin equation with colored non - thermal noise , l.breather and j. curtain theoretically predicted that dynamic arrest can occur in systems that are far from equilibrium , showing that non - equilibrium glass transition moves to lower temperature with increasing activity and to higher temperature with increasing dissipation in spin glasses@xcite .",
    "mode coupling theory ( mct ) were also proposed recently to study the glassy dynamics of driven granular fluids@xcite and active colloidal suspensions@xcite .",
    "while most of the studies so far have only considered single - component active particles , very recently , mixture systems of active - passive particles began to draw new attentions .",
    "interesting experiments@xcite reported that the addition of active particles in a system can dramatically alter its phase behavior .",
    "molecular dynamics simulation showed that introduction of activity to a passive system may not only hamper phase separation , but can enhance it as well , based on the coordination among the active particles @xcite .",
    "it was also demonstrated that activity can induce phase separation and direct self - assembly in active - passive mixtures@xcite . in particular , brownian simulations showed that one may crystallize hard - sphere glass by doping with active particles@xcite , which proposes a very interesting question about the glass transition behavior of active - passive mixtures . however , an unified microscopic theoretical framework to describe this important issue is still lacking .    in the present paper ,",
    "we develop a general mct framework to study the glass transition behavior of active - passive mixtures .",
    "our starting point is the smoluchowski equation for @xmath0-particle probability density function , wherein the particle activity is realized via an effective diffusivity that is larger than that of passive particles .",
    "such a treatment allows one to apply the mori - zwanzig projection operator formalism such that a set of closed equations regarding the time evolutions of the density correlators can be obtained .",
    "in particular , we apply this approach to a binary mixture of mono - disperse active - passive hard sphere particles , with particular attention paid on how the particle activity and the number fraction of active particles would influence the glass transition behaviors . while doping with active particles can shift the transition to higher total volume fraction as expected , we find that increasing particle activity may lead to an nontrivial type of reentrance glass transition behavior .",
    "for generality , we consider an @xmath1-component mixture of @xmath0 spherical colloidal particles , being active or not , dispersed in a simple fluid with temperature @xmath2 and volume @xmath3 . for passive particles , the over - damped dynamics can be described by langevin equations involving the time evolution of the position vector @xmath4 for an @xmath5-type particle labeled @xmath6 . for active particles ,",
    "one generally needs to consider a further orientation variable @xmath7 to account for the tumbling or rotational diffusion@xcite .",
    "very recently , it was demonstrated that the dynamics of an active particle undergoing self - propulsion and rotational diffusion can be well - approximated by a random - walk in the long time limit with an effective diffusivity@xcite .",
    "these observations facilitate us to propose a minimal model for active - passive mixtures , which starts from the smoluchowski equation for the probability density @xmath8 of the particle configuration @xmath9 ,    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the smoluchowski operator @xmath12 here @xmath13 denotes the bare diffusivity for @xmath5-type particles with total number @xmath14 and @xmath15 with @xmath16 the boltzmann constant .",
    "@xmath17 is the direct force acting on the particle @xmath18 due to the total potential energy @xmath19 of the colloidal particles , and @xmath20 is the gradient operator with respect to @xmath21 .",
    "a key factor here is the parameter @xmath22 characterizing the particle activity of @xmath5-species : @xmath23 for active particles while @xmath24 for passive ones . for an equilibrium distribution @xmath25 , @xmath26 such that the random force balances the potential force for passive particles , but not for active ones .",
    "to probe the collective dynamics of the system , one generally considers the density correlator @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the fourier transform of the density @xmath29 , and @xmath30 denotes an equilibrium average .",
    "@xmath31 is the adjoint or backward smoluchowski operator given by@xcite    @xmath32    where for arbitrary functions @xmath33 and",
    "@xmath34 of @xmath35 we have @xmath36 .",
    "the use of adjoint smoluchowski operator facilitates us to apply mori - zwanzig approach and mode - coupling methods@xcite to obtain an approximate dynamic equation for the density correlators ( [ eq : density - correlator ] ) which reads in the matrix form as ( see the supplemental information )    @xmath37    herein , @xmath38 is the inverse of the partial structure factor matrix @xmath39 , @xmath40 is a frequency matrix given by @xmath41.\\label{eq : fre_matrix}\\ ] ] @xmath42 denotes the matrix of so - called @xmath43 memory function@xcite with elements given by    @xmath44    with vortex functions    @xmath45\\label{eq : vortex}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 is the total number density and @xmath47 in which @xmath48 are direct correlation functions .",
    "@xmath49 is related to the static structure factor via @xmath50 .",
    "the mct equations ( [ eq : mct_matrixform ] ) to ( [ eq : vortex ] ) for general active - passive mixtures constitute the first part of central results of the present paper . in general",
    ", one may employ them to study the glass transition or dynamic arrest behavior of any multi - component systems . in the present work",
    ", we will mainly focus on a two - component hard - sphere system , one is active labeled by @xmath51 and the other is passive labeled by *@xmath52* . for simplicity",
    ", we consider that the diameters @xmath53 of both types of particles are the same .",
    "the total volume fraction is given by @xmath54 , with @xmath53 set to be 1 .",
    "the number fraction and the activity parameter of the active component are given by @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively , which are chosen as the main control parameters in the present study .",
    "eqs.([eq : mct_matrixform ] ) are numerically solved with percus - yevick static structure factors @xmath57 @xmath58 as input and setting @xmath59 . for a pure passive system with @xmath60 ,",
    "the equations predict a glass transition ( gt ) at volume fraction @xmath61 .",
    "first of all , we study how the particle activity influences the gt . to this end , we fix @xmath62 and set @xmath63 which is above the gt point @xmath64 for pure passive system . in fig.[fig_phi_t_lambda](a ) , we show the time evolution of the dynamic scattering functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 evaluated at @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the location of the first peak in @xmath69 , with varying particle activity @xmath70 in a relatively small range .",
    "when @xmath70 is just slightly than one , e.g. , @xmath71 , both correlators do not decay in the long time and the system remain in the glassy state .",
    "the nonegodicity parameter @xmath72 for the active particle ( dashed line ) is slightly slower than @xmath73 for the passive particle , indicating that the glassy part formed by the active component is softer than the passive part . with increasing @xmath70 , the plateau heights of both correlators decrease .",
    "above some threshold value of @xmath70(about 1.044 here ) , the correlators finally decay to zero and the system becomes fluid , wherein the active component relaxes faster than the passive one .     for passive particles ( solid lines ) and @xmath65 for active particles ( dashed lines ) evaluated at @xmath67 for different values of the activity parameter @xmath70 .",
    "the total volume fraction is @xmath63 and the number fraction of active particles is @xmath62 .",
    "( b ) dependences of the non - ergodic parameters @xmath74 evaluated at @xmath67 on the total volume fraction @xmath75 for different values of @xmath70 and @xmath62 .",
    "the right inset shows @xmath74 for several values of @xmath70 close to 1.0 for clarity .",
    "the left inset plots the dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath70 where a turnover phenomenon is apparent , wherein the dashed line refers to @xmath77 where the system shows reentrance behavior .",
    "see the text . ]    above results clearly demonstrate that increasing activity of the active component can shift gt to higher volume fractions . in fig.[fig_phi_t_lambda](b ) , we plot the nonergodic parameters @xmath74 evaluated at @xmath67 as functions of the total fraction @xmath75 for several different values of @xmath70 . as it should , @xmath74 takes a finite value at a certain discontinuous glass transition point @xmath76 before which @xmath78 . clearly , the value of @xmath76 increases fast with @xmath70 at first , e.g. , @xmath79 for @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "strikingly , however , with further increasing of @xmath70 to larger values like 5.0 , @xmath76 decreases again to a smaller value around 0.620 . in the left inset of fig.[fig_phi_t_lambda](b ) , the dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath70 is shown , where the turnover phenomenon is apparent .",
    "the above findings indicate an interesting type of reentrance behavior in active - passive mixtures for a fixed total volume fraction @xmath75 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath77 as indicated by the dashed line in the left inset of fig.[fig_phi_t_lambda](b ) , the system changes first from glass to liquid and then to glass again as @xmath70 increases . while the first transition from glass to liquid is as expected because activity can push the glass transition to higher volume fraction , the second one from liquid to glass again is rather counterintuitive . to get more insight",
    ", we have plot the nonergodic parameters @xmath83 and @xmath74 for all wave vectors in fig.[fig_fk_all](a ) for @xmath77 and @xmath70 from 1.05 to 6.0 . for @xmath84 where the system is in glassy state , we see that the profiles of@xmath83 and @xmath74 are nearly the same , with only slight differences in their values . for @xmath85",
    "the system is still glass , with the active part much softer than the passive part . for @xmath82 and 4.0 ,",
    "the system is in the liquid phase because all the @xmath86s are now zero .",
    "nevertheless , for further larger values of @xmath70 , say 5.0 and 6.0 , the system becomes glassy again since both @xmath83 and @xmath74 have nonzero values in some @xmath87 range .",
    "interestingly , we find that the profiles of @xmath83 and @xmath74 are quite different in this latter case .",
    "@xmath74 remains a relatively large value and contains many peaks indicating the passive component is frozen at all length scales but with a certain type of structure .",
    "however , @xmath88 is only apparently nonzero for small @xmath87 and is almost zero for @xmath87 larger than some threshold value , suggesting that the active part is still liquid - like in short length scales but being frozen in large scales .",
    "we note here that a few interesting reentrance behaviors regarding glass transition have been reported in the literatures .",
    "for instance , for passive hard - spheres with short - range attractions , it was found that increasing the attraction can melt glass , however , further increasing attraction can lead to glass again@xcite .",
    "the reentrance was due to the existence of two qualitatively different glassy states : one with structural arrest due to caging and the other with arrest due to bonding .",
    "for passive hard sphere mixtures with very disparate sizes , reentrance behavior@xcite as well as multiple glasses@xcite have also been reported .",
    "reentrance glass transition has also been found for fluids in porous media , where for large volume fraction of immobile matrix particles , increasing or decreasing the number fraction of fluid particles may both lead to glassy states@xcite .",
    "multiple reentrant glass transitions were also found in a confined system of hard spheres between two parallel walls@xcite .",
    "here we report a new type of reentrance glass transition behavior induced by particle activity . as demonstrated in fig.[fig_fk_all ] , the reentrance here may be also due to existence of two types of nonequilibrium glassy states . for small activity",
    ", the dynamic arrest is due to the caging effect of both passive and active particles . increasing activity acts as noise which can destroy the cages and melt the glass .",
    "if activity is too large , however , local phase separation@xcite of the active particles could happen such that active particles can form local clusters , which may also leads to dynamic arrest . in this case",
    ", the non - clustered active particles can still move like liquids within small length scales , such that @xmath83 is nearly zero for large @xmath87 .",
    "it is interesting to check such a scenario by large scale computer simulations , which definitely deserves a separate future work .",
    "we would like to mention here that in a recent simulation work of active - passive mixtures@xcite , the authors demonstrated that the active component triggers phase separation into a dense and a dilute phase , where active - passive segregation were further observed in the dense phase with rafts of passive particles in a sea of active particles .",
    "we suggest that the reentrant glassy state for large activity we found in the present work may look like this type of active - passive segregation in dense phase .",
    "( solid lines ) and @xmath83 ( dashed lines ) in the whole @xmath87 range for different values of @xmath70 at fixed total volume fraction @xmath77 and @xmath62 where reentrance behavior can be observed .",
    "for relatively large @xmath89 and @xmath90 , @xmath83 is nearly zero for large @xmath87 and apparently nonzero for small @xmath87 .",
    "( b ) dependence of the glass transition point @xmath76 on particle activity @xmath70 for different @xmath55 .",
    "reentrance behavior disappears if @xmath55 is too large . ]",
    "we now consider how the above results depend on the number fraction @xmath55 of the active component . in fig.[fig_fk_all](b ) , the dependences of @xmath76 on @xmath70 for different values of @xmath55 are shown .",
    "clearly , the reentrance behavior can occur in a large range of values of @xmath55 .",
    "but for too large @xmath55 , @xmath76 will become saturated to a value about 0.65 , which is consistent with the result for a pure active system@xcite .",
    "thus one conclude that the interesting reentrance behavior reported above is a specific feature of active - passive mixture system and can not occur for a pure active system .",
    "the data also indicates that @xmath76 increases monotonically with @xmath55 for a fixed @xmath70 , which is in consistent with the simulation work of r. ni @xmath91 that doping active particles can help crystallizing hard spheres by melting glass@xcite .",
    "note that the reentrance behavior does not exist with variation of @xmath55 .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a mode - coupling theory starting from smoluchowski equations to study the nonequilibrium glassy dynamics in mixtures of active - passive particles .",
    "this microscopic theory makes it convenient to study the relaxation of the density correlators and make predictions about the liquid - glass transition boundaries .",
    "in particular , we have applied our theory to investigate the glass dynamics of a binary mixture of mono - disperse active - passive hard spheres .",
    "the theory clearly demonstrates that doping with active particles will push the critical volume fraction @xmath76 for glass transition to higher values .",
    "in addition , we find an interesting type of reentrance behavior induced by particle activity .",
    "for a certain given total volume fraction where the system is in glassy state without activity , increasing the activity level will first melt the glass , while further increasing activity may lead to a glassy state again .",
    "the @xmath87-dependent nonergodic parameters for the active and passive components share similar profiles in the former glass state , while they are quite different in the latter one , wherein the active particles are frozen in large scales but remain fluid - like in small ones .",
    "such a reentrance behavior is found to be a specific feature of a mixture system , while it is absent in a pure active system .",
    "we believe that our present work can offer more perspectives in the study of collective dynamics of active - passive mixtures , as well as the frontier topic regarding nonequilirbium glass transition .",
