    "non - gibbsian measures are known to appear in many circumstances . historically they were observed first in the context of position - space renormalization group transformation and termed as so - called rg pathologies @xcite .",
    "later more and more examples were discovered @xcite which showed that the application of many maps applied to an infinite - volume gibbs measure may result in similar `` pathologies '' , meaning that the image measure is not a gibbs measure anymore .",
    "when such a phenomenon appears it means that conditional probabilities of the image system will acquire long - range dependencies , at least for some non - removable configurations .",
    "particularly interesting examples of infinite - volume transformations are coming from the study of dynamics @xcite .",
    "the first prototypical result in that direction is due to van enter , fernandez , den hollander , redig who considered an infinite - temperature ( or high temperature ) glauber dynamics starting from an initial low - temperature ising model on the two- or more - dimensional integer lattice .",
    "in particular they proved that a low - temperature initial measure in vanishing external magnetic field becomes non - gibbs after sufficiently large times and stays non - gibbs forever .",
    "this has to be contrasted with the simple fact that for independent dynamics , viewed on local observables , the time - evolved measure converges exponentially fast in time to the symmetric product measure .",
    "in fact such a phenomenon is possible since the gibbs property ( continuity property of conditional probabilities of the system ) is to be tested in arbitrarily large volumes .",
    "later more investigations for time - evolutions were performed .",
    "the general picture is that for very general dynamics and very general initial measures the time - evolved measures are again gibbsian , for a sufficiently small time - interval @xcite .",
    "long times however , even for simple dynamics offer the possibility for the emergence of non - gibbsian measures .",
    "the discontinuities in the conditional probabilities which are responsible are produced by hidden phase transitions which pop up as a result of the conditioning procedure .",
    "depending on the specific nature of the system there may be many mechanisms of such singularities @xcite . in this context continuous spin models are particularly interesting @xcite .    while it is surprising that even the physically simple transformation of heating produces non - gibbsian behavior it would even be more interesting to say something about _ cooling dynamics_. more generally one would like to study a gibbs measure @xmath5 for an initial hamiltonian @xmath6 which is subjected to a glauber dynamics for another hamiltonian @xmath7 , which gives rise to a trajectory @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes time .",
    "glauber dynamics at low temeratures describes fast cooling or `` quenching '' .",
    "the question is to understand the behavior of @xmath8 , and in particular for which times it will be gibbs . since this is as yet too difficult on the lattice , we develop our results in mean - field .",
    "a mean - field system of ising - type is called non - gibbs if the single - site conditional probabilities depend in a discontinuous way on the magnetization of the conditioning spins @xcite .",
    "investigations for mean - field models tend to reproduce the lattice results in many situations @xcite but often lead to an explicit knowledge of the parameter regions where gibbsianness and non - gibbsianness occur .",
    "such an analysis has been performed for the curie - weiss model subjected to an independent spin - flip dynamics in @xcite .",
    "it was proved there that for initial high temperatures @xmath10 the time - evolved measure is gibbs forever , while for @xmath11 there exists a sharp transition - time separating a gibbsian from a non - gibbsian regime . in the course of the analysis of that paper , also the phenomenon of symmetry - breaking in the set of bad configurations",
    "was observed which happens for the smaller range of initial temperatures below @xmath12 . in the present paper we build on that analysis but are able to extend the results to dependent spin - flips according to a glauber dynamics with an arbitrary other temperature @xmath13 .    to understand discontinuous behavior of conditional probabilities for the time - evolved model at fixed time @xmath9 one needs to look at the model resulting from the initial measure at time @xmath14 under application of the dynamics in the space - time region for times @xmath15 between @xmath16 and @xmath9 .",
    "the hidden phase transitions responsible for the non - gibbsian behavior occur if there is a sensitive dependence of the model at time @xmath14 obtained from constraining the space - time measure to certain configurations at time @xmath17 . if a small variation of such a constraining configuration leads to a jump in the constrained initial measure it will ( generically ) be a bad configuration for the conditional probabilities of the system at time @xmath9 . _ small variation",
    "_ means in the lattice case a perturbation in an annulus far away from the origin . _",
    "_ means in the mean - field case a small variation of the magnetization as a real number . in the independent spin - flip lattice example of @xcite",
    "the chessboard configuration was a bad one , correspondingly in the independent spin - flip mean - field case of @xcite the configurations with neutral magnetization equal to zero were bad ones for large enough times .",
    "moreover , configurations with non - zero magnetization also appeared as points of discontinuity for the limiting conditional probabilities , in a particular bounded region of the parameter space of initial temperature and time .",
    "this phenomenon was called biased non - gibbsianness in @xcite .",
    "the complete analysis for the mean - field independent spin - flip situation was possible since the constrained system on the first layer could be understood on the level of the magnetization .",
    "the relevant quantities could be computed in terms of the rate - function for a standard quenched disordered model , namely the curie - weiss random - field ising model with possibly non - symmetric random - field distribution of the quenched disorder .    to deal with dependent - dynamics case",
    "a different route has to be taken since the dependence of the initial system on the conditioning is more intricate .",
    "as we will see , we will need to invoke the path large deviation principle for the dynamics with temperature @xmath13 on the level of magnetizations .",
    "we will then have to minimize a cost functional of paths of magnetizations which is composed of the rate function along the path and an initial `` punishment '' term , which depends both on the initial hamiltonian @xmath6 and the dynamical hamiltonian @xmath7 , evaluated at the unknown initial point of the trajectory .",
    "the solution of the problem gives a surprising connection between path properties of the corresponding ( integrable ) dynamical system and gibbs properties of a model of statistical mechanics . as a result we are providing a full description of the regions of gibbsian and non - gibbsian behavior as a function of time , initial temperature , and dynamical temperature .",
    "as a special case the previous results for infinite - temperature dynamics are reproduced ( adding some geometrical insight about the behavior of typical paths ) . furthermore the solution reveals a new mechanism for the appearance of bad configurations in the region of cooling from low temperatures with even lower temperatures .",
    "these are related to periodic motion in the dynamical system .",
    "the present paper is to our knowledge the first one where gibbs properties of a model subjected to a low - temperature dynamics are investigated and it will be challenging to see which parts of the behavior are occurring on the lattice .",
    "after the completion of our work we learnt about the preprint @xcite where a large - deviation approach was proposed to understand dynamical transitions in the gibbs properties for lattice systems , too . while there is a beautiful formalism available for path large deviations of empirical measures of lattice systems on an abstract level , explicit results are very hard , which underlines also the use of our present paper , and the necessity of future research .",
    "moreover the questions and methods used should have interest also in models of population dynamics . in such models a population of @xmath18 individuals ,",
    "each individual carrying genes from a finite alphabet of possible types , performs a stochastic dynamics which can be described on the level of empirical distributions . starting the dynamics from a known initial measure corresponds to an a - priori belief ( prior distribution ) over the distribution of types .",
    "conditioning to a final configuration @xmath19 at time @xmath9 corresponds to measuring the distribution of types .",
    "the occurrence of multiple histories leading to the same @xmath19 ( which is responsible for non - gibbsianness in the spin - model ) has the interesting interpretation of a non - unique best estimator for the path explaining the present mix of genes .",
    "we start at time @xmath14 with the curie - weiss ising model in zero magnetic field at inverse temperature @xmath20 whose finite - volume gibbs measures on spin - configurations @xmath21}=(\\s_i)_{i=1,\\dots , n}\\in\\{-1,1\\}^n$ ] are given by @xmath22 } ) = \\frac{\\exp\\bigl(\\frac{\\b}{2 n}\\bigl(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\s_i\\bigr)^2    \\bigr)}{z_{\\b , n}}\\ ] ] where the normalization factor @xmath23 is the standard partition function .",

    "[ fig : phaseportraitallowed ] there are several _ _ acc__s drawn which correspond to different values of @xmath20 , but the same value of the dynamical inverse temperature @xmath182 , which is reltively low .",
    "the production of discontinuities of the limiting conditional probabilities will be related to the time - evolution of the curve of allowed initial configurations under the euler - lagrange vector field , as we will describe now .",
    "let us first give a definition of a bad quadruple of initial temperature , dynamical temperature , time , and final magnetization in terms of dynamical - systems quantities .",
    "we start by defining candidate quadruples making use of the euler - lagrange flow in the following way .",
    "the quadruple @xmath183 is called _ pre - bad _ iff there exists a pair @xmath184 of initial magnetizations s.t .",
    "the solution of the initial value problem of the euler - lagrange equations started in the corresponding points @xmath185 and @xmath186 on the allowed - configurations curve for @xmath84 has the same magnetization value @xmath187 at time @xmath9 , that is @xmath188    while this first definition refers only to the existence of overhangs of the time - evolved allowed - configurations curve , the next definition involves also the value of the cost ( the large deviation functional together with the punishment term ) , which makes it much more restrictive .",
    "we will exploit both definitions both to gain geometric insight as well as numerical results .",
    "the important connection to non - gibbsian behavior of the time - evolved measure lies in the fact that @xmath191 of a bad quadruple will ( generically ) be a bad configuration for @xmath192 . indeed , to see this , let us go back to the explicit expression of the limiting conditional probabilities , given by @xmath193 note that the function @xmath194 is not well defined for @xmath195 itself since at time @xmath9 there are two minimizing paths available , one from @xmath196 to @xmath191 and one from @xmath197 to @xmath191 .",

    "@xmath191 the paths will become unique and we might select the minimizing paths ( and hence their initial points ) by approaching the bad configuration from the right or left , obtaining ( say ) @xmath198 and @xmath199 . note that we also expect that ( generically ) @xmath200 .",
    "this follows since the @xmath201 are probabilities for two different single - particle markov chains , one depending on the path starting from @xmath185 , the other one on the path starting from @xmath186 .",
    "we note that , knowing the paths entering the @xmath201 s , an explicit formula for @xmath201 in terms of time - integrals can be written , and so , given ( numerical ) knowledge of the minimizing path , the @xmath202 can be obtained by simple integrations . unless these two discontinuities compensate each other ( which is generically not happening and which can be quickly checked by numerics ) we will have that @xmath203 .",
    "consequently the model will be non - gibbs at the time @xmath9 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath183 is not _ bad _ , then @xmath204 is a continuity point .",
    "this follows since in that case all @xmath19-dependent terms in deform in a continuous way .",
    "so the absence of bad points ( and a fortiori the absence of pre - bad points ) implies gibbsianness at @xmath205 .",
    "we just saw that non - gibbsianness is produced by multiple histories which means in other words the production of overhangs in the time - evolved curve of allowed initial configurations . to get an intuition for this",
    "let us discuss the regions 2 ) and 3 ) of the main theorem in more detail .",
    "let us begin with the phase - space picture for the non - interacting dynamics @xmath111 .",
    "we are starting with the region 2a ) of non - symmetry - breaking non - gibbsianness i.e. @xmath206 .",

    "since @xmath207 appears at a threshold time and stays to be the only bad configuration from that on , the graph of bad configurations is just a straight line starting at the threshold time . in the picture [ fig:1m0mng :",
    "a ] we see the corresponding initial points of the history curves which are conditioned to end at @xmath19 .    the lower line of [ fig:1m0mng ] has an initial temperature for which non - gibbsian behavior with symmetry - breaking takes place , in an intermediate time - interval .",
    "the right plot shows the corresponding non - negative branch of bad configurations @xmath19 .",
    "( by the symmetry of the model , taking the negative of these one obtains the full set of bad configurations . )",
    "the left plot shows the corresponding initial points of the history curves which are conditioned to end at the non - negative bad configurations @xmath19 on the right .",
    "finally , figure [ fig:3m0mng ] displays the time - evolution of bad configurations and their initial points for a low - temperature dynamics .",
    "the lowest line corresponds to heating from very low initial temperature and shows non - gibbsianness with symmetry - breaking at an intermediate time - interval .",
    "the middle line corresponds to heating from an intermediate lower temperature and shows non - gibbsianness without symmetry - breaking .",
    "these two mechanisms are known from high - temperature dynamics .",
    "figures [ fig:3m0mng : a ] and [ fig:3m0mng : b ] correspond to cooling and shows data from the region of periodic orbits .",
    "applying numerical integration of the euler - lagrange equations from initial conditions chosen on the allowed - configurations curve , check for intersecting trajectories and numerical computation of the cost function we can get ( numerical approximations to ) the array of bad quadruples @xmath183 , augmented by the possible initial points . with this procedure we rederived the gibbs - non - gibbs phase diagram for @xmath111 ( which was obtained earlier in@xcite ) .",
    "based on it we can draw the gibbs - non - gibbs phase - diagram at any dynamical temperature @xmath53 .",
    "an example for this was presented in the introduction of the present paper in figure [ fig : gng ] for a fixed low dynamical temperature .",
    "let us first consider first a simpler markov jump process for the magnetization with transition rates which to not depend on the state @xmath85 of the process .",
    "the corresponding path large deviation principle can be built up as follows .",
    "the first ingredient is the large deviation principle for the compound poisson process .",
    "* proof : * let us look at the logarithmic moment generating function @xmath219 , defined by @xmath220 recall the grtner - ellis theorem ( theorem 2.3.6 . in @xcite , page 44 ) which states the following .",
    "assume that @xmath221 exists .",
    "then the distribution of the variable @xmath216 satisfies a ldp on @xmath217 with rate function @xmath222 , which is the fenchel - legendre transform of @xmath223 . in our case",
    "we have equality even at finite @xmath18 of the form @xmath224 and the legendre transform gives @xmath225 so the theorem follows .",
    "@xmath153    in the next step we go from one - dimensional large deviations to large deviations of finite - imensional marginals in the path space of the compound poisson process . this way of arguing corresponds to @xcite lemma 5.1.8 , page 178 , which is a step to prove mogulskii s theorem .",
    "recall that mogulskii s theorem states that the paths of empirical averages of the form @xmath226 satisfy a ldp .",

    "we have only treated the compound poisson process with constant rates , which is not the case here , since we consider state - dependent spin - flip dynamics , meaning state - dependent rates .",
    "we need to justify rigorously that we can replace the contribution to the integral over the lagrangian density for the infinitesimal time - interval @xmath239 of the form @xmath240 by a term @xmath241 if the transition rates of the markov chain depend on the state @xmath156 . in order to do that a comparison result is needed which compares a markov chain with constant rates with the original markov chain with state - dependent ( but bounded ) rates on the level of the logarithm of the exponential moment generating function , on small time - intervals .",
    "we are grateful to frank redig for communicating the following result to us which is an essential ingredient .",
    "informally , the following lemma states that a jump process @xmath242 on the discrete space with constant jump - up , jump - down rates @xmath243 does not differ much from a process @xmath244 with state - dependent rates @xmath245 when the time interval @xmath246 $ ] , where both processes are considered , is sufficiently small and @xmath18 is sufficiently large .",
    "this is due to the fact that the state of @xmath247 can not change a lot if @xmath248 is small and @xmath18 is large . at small times",
    "@xmath244 can make not much more jumps than @xmath249 jumps of a small height , therefore the state - dependent rates @xmath250 and @xmath251 will not vary much .    *",
    "f. redig s useful lemma . * denote by @xmath252 the markov process on the discrete space @xmath253 started at @xmath96 with constant non - zero rates @xmath254 to go up of down by one step , and by @xmath244 the true process started at the same point @xmath96 with state - dependent rates @xmath255 given by .",
    "then @xmath256    the full proof will appear elsewhere , along with generalizations to more general local state spaces . employing the lemma and going through suprema over finite partitions again , the proof of theorem [ thm : formj ]",
    "is obtained where we still need to identify the form of the lagrangian density .",
    "let us start again with a compound poisson process with jumps of size @xmath142 with the distribution @xmath257 where @xmath258 is fixed in the beginning .",
    "if we denote again @xmath259 and @xmath260 we have that @xmath261 as a solution of a quadratic equation shows .",
    "choosing the rates in the rescaled compound poisson process to go up by @xmath262 ( or down by @xmath263 ) to match the rates in the generator @xmath264 we are led to choose @xmath265 and this explains the form of the lagrangian density @xmath266 , after a small computation .",
    "this concludes our treatment of the proof .",

    "the @xmath15-integral one arrives at the euler - lagrange equation for @xmath15 in the interval between @xmath16 and @xmath9 , and the additional free end condition at the initial point , the latter one following by demanding that the terms proportional to @xmath271 have to vanish .",
    "alternatively , the problem can be reformulated in terms of a problem with different lagrange density but without initial punishment term , via incorporation of the initial term into the integrand . from here",

    "hamiltonian and lagrangian formalism following a suggestion of a referee , let us remark that , as an alternative to the derivation in terms of approximations by compound poisson processes , the form of the lagrangian can also be obtained going through the formalism of @xcite , see chapter 1.4 .",
    "let us briefly sketch this procedure for the convenience of the reader .",
