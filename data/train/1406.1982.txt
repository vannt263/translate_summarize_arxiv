    "the velocity , @xmath8 , of a particle interacting with a heat bath exhibits stochastic behavior which in many cases is difficult to evaluate .",
    "the position of the particle , assumed to start at the origin at time @xmath9 , is the time integral over the fluctuating velocity @xmath10 and demands a probabilistic approach to determine its statistical properties .",
    "luckily the central limit theorem makes it possible , for many processes , to predict a gaussian shape for the diffusing packet .",
    "then the diffusion constant @xmath11 characterizes the normal motion through its mean square displacement @xmath12 .",
    "the remaining goal , for a given process or model , is to compute @xmath11 and other transport coefficients . in normal cases",
    "this can be done , at least in principle , via the green - kubo formalism , namely by the calculation of the stationary velocity correlation function , which gives the diffusivity @xmath13 .",
    "an alternative approach is investigated in this work and is based on the concept of excursions .",
    "we assume that the random process @xmath8 is recurrent and thus the velocity crosses the zero point , @xmath14 , many times in the observation window @xmath15 .",
    "we divide the path @xmath16 into a sum of increments @xmath17 here @xmath18 are the points in time of the velocity zero - crossings , @xmath19 . in the interval",
    "@xmath20 the velocity is either strictly positive or negative .",
    "the velocity in each interval is thus a stochastic process which starts and ends on the origin without crossing it in between .",
    "such a random curve is called an excursion .",
    "the random spatial increment @xmath21 is the area under the excursion .",
    "the position of the particle , according to eq .",
    "( [ eqint01 ] ) , is the sum of the random increments , namely a sum of the signed areas under the velocity excursions , each having a random duration .",
    "the goal of this paper is to relate the statistics of the areas under these velocity excursions and the corresponding random time intervals between zero crossings , to the problem of spatial diffusion .",
    "this connection is easy to find in the case that the increments @xmath22 and the duration of the excursions @xmath23 are mutually uncorrelated , independent and identically distributed random variables . over a long measurement time , the number of excursions is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the average time for an excursion . then according to eq .",

    ". we will arrive at the simple equation ( [ eqintro03 ] ) only at the end of our work , in sec .",
    "[ secnormal ] , while here it merely serves as an appetizer to motivate the consideration of velocity excursions in some detail , and to suggest the usefulness of developing tools for the calculation of @xmath28 and @xmath25 ( here @xmath29 , by symmetry ) .",
    "obviously eq .",
    "( [ eqintro03 ] ) is based on the assumption that the variance @xmath28 is finite , and as mentioned , that correlations are not important .",
    "the major effort of this paper is directed to considering a more challenging case , namely a physically relevant stochastic process where the variance @xmath28 diverges , and more importantly the process exhibits correlations between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the particular system we investigate is a model for diffusion of atoms in optical lattices , following the experiments @xcite and the semi - classical theory of sisyphus cooling @xcite .",
    "one type of excursion which has been thoroughly investigated is the brownian excursion @xcite . a brownian",
    "excursion is a conditioned one dimensional brownian motion @xmath8 over the time interval @xmath30 .",
    "the motion starts at @xmath31 ( eventually the @xmath32 limit is taken ) and ends at @xmath33 and is constrained not to cross the origin @xmath14 in the observation time @xmath34 .",
    "the area under this curve is a random variable , whose statistical properties have been investigated by mathematicians @xcite .",
    "more recently , this problem was treated with a path integral approach to describe statistics of fluctuating interfaces @xcite and related areas until the first passage time are used to describe universality of sandpile models @xcite . here",
    ", we generalize the brownian excursion to a process @xmath8 described by a langevin equation , with an asymptotically logarithmic potential .",
    "we show how the random area under this langevin excursion determines the dynamics of cold atoms .",
    "we believe that langevin excursions , or more generally random excursions , are useful tools in many areas of statistical physics , hence their investigation beyond the well studied brownian excursion , is worthwhile .    if @xmath8 is a brownian motion , or as we will proceed to show for cold atoms in shallow lattices , the set of points where @xmath35 is non - trivial , as it contains no isolated points and no interval .",
    "this is the case since we are dealing with a continuous path with power law statistics of the crossing times ( see details below ) .",
    "mathematician have investigated the statistics of level crossing , e.g. zero crossing , of continuous paths in great detail .",
    "the concept of local time , introduced by p. lvy in the context of brownian motion and ito s excursion theory for continuous paths , are pillars in this field , see @xcite and references within . here",
    "we use a heuristic approach , with a modification of the original process @xmath8 , by introducing a cutoff @xmath36 : the starting point of the particle after each zero hitting , which is taken to zero at the end .",
    "this makes it possible to use renewal theory , and continuous time random walks , which are tools well studied in physics literature of discrete processes . in this sense",
    "we differ from rigorous mathematical approaches .",
    "thus we avoid the problem of continuous paths , for example the infinite number of zero crossings , by replacing the original path with an @xmath37 modified path for which the number of zero crossings is finite ( when @xmath37 is finite ) .",
    "we show that physical quantities characterizing the entire process have a finite @xmath38 limit .",

    "( [ eqintro03 ] ) , for langevin dynamics of @xmath8 , both @xmath25 and @xmath39 approach zero as @xmath32 , their ratio @xmath11 approaches a finite limit .",
    "one might wonder why we wish to use excursions and their peculiar properties to evaluate the spreading of atoms or more generally other transport systems .",
    "the answer is that it turns into a useful strategy when the friction forces are non - linear .",
    "in particular we will investigate laser cooling , where within the semi - classical theory , the dimensionless friction force is @xcite ( see details below ) @xmath40 this friction force , induced by the laser fields , is linear for small velocities @xmath41 similar to the stokes friction law for a massive brownian particle in water at room temperature .",
    "however , unlike such friction , which increases in magnitude with velocity , here for large @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "asymptotically , then , the system is frictionless .",
    "this implies that fast particles have to remain fast for a long time , which in turn induces heavy - tailed populations of fast particles @xcite . in this case , as we show later , the standard picture of diffusion breaks down .",
    "more specifically , the problem of diffusion of cold atoms under sisyphus cooling was partially treated by marksteiner , et al .",
    "@xcite . while clearly indicating the anomalous nature of the diffusion process , the main tool used was the evaluation of the stationary velocity correlation function of the process , followed by the use of the green - kubo formalism for the evaluation of @xmath11 .",
    "they showed that for a certain critical value of the depth of the optical lattice the value of @xmath11 diverges ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "katori et al .",
    "@xcite measured the mean square displacement @xmath44 and recorded the onset of super - diffusion @xmath45 beyond a critical depth of the optical lattice @xcite .",
    "wickenbrock et al .",
    "@xcite in the context of driven optical lattice experiments demonstrated with monte carlo simulations an upper limit on the spreading of the atoms @xmath46 .",
    "sagi et al .",
    "@xcite showed that a packet of spreading rb atoms can be fitted with a lvy distribution instead of a gaussian distribution found for normal diffusion .",
    "these findings clearly indicate the breakdown of the usual strategy of treating normal diffusion and hence promoted further theoretical investigations .",
    "the velocity correlation function is not stationary and hence the green - kubo formalism must be replaced @xcite .",
    "the moments exhibit multifractal behavior @xcite , there is an enhanced sensitivity to the initial preparation of the system @xcite , momentum fluctuations are described by an infinite covariant density @xcite and in certain parameter regimes the lvy central limit theorem applies instead of the standard gaussian version @xcite . in this regime of shallow optical lattices",
    "the power of the analysis of the area under langevin excursions becomes essential as we will show here .",
    "we note that the relation of laser cooling with lvy statistics is not limited to the case of sisyphus cooling considered in this manuscript .",
    "sub - recoil laser cooling , a setup different from ours , also leads to fundamental relations between statistical physics of rare events , and laser - atom physics @xcite .",
    "for a recent mini - review on the departure from boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics for cold atoms in optical lattices , see @xcite .",
    "the current work significantly extends the investigation of the properties of the spatial distribution of atoms in sisyphus cooling begun in ref .",
    "there we uncovered three phases of the motion which are controlled by the depth @xmath47 of the optical lattice : a gaussian phase @xmath48 , a lvy phase @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and a richardson phase @xmath51 ( see details below ) . within the intermediate phase ,",
    "the density of particles , in the central region of the packet , is described by a symmetric lvy distribution , similar to the fitting procedure used in a recent weizmann institute experiment @xcite .",
    "however , this can not be the whole story . as is well known",

    "we showed related _",
    "numerical _ evidence that the lvy distribution is cut off at distances of the order @xmath51 .",
    "this breakdown of lvy statistics arises due to the importance of correlations between jump lengths @xmath3 and jump duration @xmath4 , which are neglected in the derivation of the lvy distribution .",
    "our purpose here is to investigate these correlations in detail .",
    "as we proceed to show , the correlations are given by the statistical properties of the langevin excursions discussed above , for all except the last interval .",
    "because the velocity is not constrained to be zero at the measurement time @xmath53 , this last interval is not described by an excursion but rather by a langevin meander , where the random walk @xmath8 begins at the origin and does not return for the entire duration of the walk .",
    "the properties of the excursions and meanders enter in a modified montroll - weiss @xcite equation for the fourier - laplace transform of the density @xmath7 which we derive .",
    "we then use this equation to calculate a quantity which is sensitive to the correlations , namely the mean square displacement .",
    "the mean square displacement exhibits anomalous diffusion and is sensitive to the last jump event , i.e. , to the statistics of the meander .",
    "thus , our treatment modifies both the celebrated montroll - weiss equation , to include the last jump in the sequence ( i.e. , the meander ) and the existing theory of areas under brownian meanders and excursions to include the dissipative friction force , which is responsible to the cooling of the atoms .",
    "our analysis illuminates the rich physical behavior and provides the needed set of mathematical tools beyond the decoupling approximation used to obtain the lvy distribution in our previous work . for completeness , we present a detailed decoupled and coupled analysis , the latter being the main focus of the current work .    the paper is organized as follows .",

    "a rigorous mathematical treatment of the problem will lead to a stronger foundation of our results .",
    "regularization of the process is crucially important in the lvy and gaussian phase @xmath333 where observables depend on the details of the potential @xmath85 .",

    "@xcite on the classification of boundaries for the non - regularized bessel process .",
    "they showed that , using our notation , for @xmath333 , @xmath58 is an exit boundary while for @xmath342 it is a regular boundary ( @xmath570 corresponds to an entrance boundary condition , which is not relevant to our work ) .",
    "for an exit boundary starting on @xmath571 it is impossible to reach a finite momentum state @xmath66 so clearly we can not afford such a boundary in our physical problem .",
    "for that reason , we need to consider the regularized first passage time problem at least when @xmath333 , and then the boundary is regular .",
    "a regular boundary on @xmath58 means the the diffusion process can enter and leave from the boundary .",
    "therefore , for @xmath342 our final results do not depend on the shape of @xmath85 , besides its asymptotic limit , namely one may replace the regularized bessel process with the non - regularized one . to see this , notice that @xmath131 for @xmath342 depends on @xmath455 but not on small scale properties of @xmath85 and since @xmath232 is the first passage exponent for both the regularized and non - regularized processes , it does not really matter which process is the starting point of the calculation .",
    "further evidence for such a behavior is in appendix f , where statistics of durations for @xmath342 are shown to depend on @xmath455 but not on the shape of @xmath85 .",
    "thus the @xmath132 marks transition from richardson to lvy behavior , the diverging of the partition function @xmath572 namely the equilibrium velocity distribution turns non - normalizable , and according to martin et al .",
    "the boundary of the bessel process switches from regular to exit .",
    "additional theoretical work is needed on the leakage of particles , and more generally evaporation ( see more details below ) . assuming that energetic particles are those which get evaporated , and that this takes place through the boundary of the system",
    ", one would be interested in the first passage time properties of particles , from the center of the system to one of its boundaries .",
    "previous theoretical work on first passage times for lvy walks and flights might give a useful first insight , @xcite however it is left for future work to compare these simplified models with the microscopic semiclassical picture of the underlying dynamics .",
    "evaporation is an important ingredient of cooling ( beyond the sisyphus cooling ) since it gets rid of the very energetic particles ; hence this line of research has practical applications .",
    "theoretically , understanding the boundary conditions for fractional diffusion equations , needed for the calculation of statistics of first passage times , is still an open challenge .",
    "yet another challenge is to characterize the joint pdf @xmath77 and in particular the correlations between position and momentum , which are expected to be non - trivial .",
    "again , some elegant ideas and tools were recently developed @xcite within the lvy walk framework , however more work is needed for direct comparison with the physical picture under consideration .",
    "experiments on ultra - cold diffusing particles in optical lattices have been performed on a single @xmath1mg@xmath2 ion @xcite and an ensemble of rb atoms @xcite .",
    "experiments on the spreading of the density of atoms yield ensemble averages like the mean square displacement and the density @xmath7 .",
    "analysis of individual trajectories yields , in principle , deep insight on paths , for example information on the first passage time in velocity space , i.e. @xmath129 , zero crossing times , statistics of excursions and meanders etc . for a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of the particles ,",
    "both types of experiments are needed .",
    "the theory presented herein provides statistical information on the stochastic trajectories , e.g. , zero crossing events , which in turn are related to the spreading of the packet of particles . thus from single trajectories ,",
    "one may estimate @xmath129 , @xmath276 , and @xmath6 . from @xmath129",
    "one may then obtain the exponent @xmath232 which can be used to predict the qualitative features of the spreading of the ensemble of particles .",
    "for example with an estimate of @xmath232 we can determine the phase of motion , be it richardson , lvy or gauss .",
    "of course , a more quantitative investigation is now possible , since we have analytically related @xmath232 , the mean square displacement , and @xmath396 with microscopical parameters like the optical potential depth @xmath47 . in principle",
    ", statistics of bessel excursions , so far of great interest mainly in the mathematical literature , could be detected in single particle experiments .",
    "these single ion experiments are also ideal in the sense that collisions / interparticle interactions , do not play a role and they also provide insights on ergodicity .",
    "three specific unsolved issues are :    * can the richardson phase be experimentally demonstrated ?",
    "so far this phase was obtained in our theory , and monte carlo simulations @xcite , while experiments exhibit ballistic diffusion as the upper limit @xcite .",
    "this might be related to the subtle limit of taking time to infinity before the depth of optical lattice approaches zero , since clearly in the absence of an optical lattice the fastest particles are ballistic . * while our theory predicts correctly a lvy phase in agreement with experiments , in @xcite two exponents were used to fit the data .",
    "in contrast the theory we developed suggests a single lvy exponent @xmath231 .",
    "this could be due to the leakage of particles and also to the @xmath384 cutoff of the lvy density , which are due to the correlations between @xmath3 and @xmath4 investigated in this manuscript . avoiding the leakage of particles is an experimental challenge , and",
    "once this is accomplished , a more informed comparison of our theoretical prediction on the lvy phase with a single characteristic exponent @xmath231 could be made .",
    "success on this front would provide an elegant demonstration of lvy s central limit theorem , with the characteristic exponent controlled by the depth of the optical potential . *",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , losses of atoms lead to an underestimate of the diffusion exponent , as many super - diffusing atoms are lost .",
    "characterisation of these losses both theoretically and experimentally could advance the field , since this yields insight on the underlying processes and leads as towards better control of the particles .",
    "specifically , we do not know what is the number of particles kept in the system , versus time , for varying strength of the optical potential .",
    "* in the lvy phase , measurements of non - integer moments @xmath573 with @xmath574 will according to theory exhibit lvy scaling @xmath575 .",
    "in contrast , the main focus of experiments so far was the second moment @xmath576 , which is difficult to determine statistically since as we have shown here it depends on the tails of @xmath7 and very fast particles",
    ". thus ideally a wide spectrum of moments @xmath573 should be recorded in experiment , the low order moments @xmath577 giving information on the center part of the density while higher order moments on the correlations and tails .    in the case that experiment and theory will not reconcile",
    ", we will have strong indication that the current semi - classical theory in not sufficient and then we will be forced to investigate at least four other aspects of the problem :    * effects of collisions on anomalous diffusion of the atoms . * effect of higher dimensions . * quantum effects beyond the semi - classical approach used here .",
    "in particular it would be very interesting to simulate this system with full quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite , to compare the semiclassical theory with quantum dynamics .",
    "we note that the richardson phase , which as mentioned was not observed in experiments , is actually a heating phase and quantum simulations become difficult because the numerical lattice introduces a cutoff on velocities which induces artificial ballistic motion . *",
    "other cutoff effects that modify the anomalous diffusion .",
    "for example at high enough velocities , doppler cooling is expected to diminish the fast particles .",
    "in @xcite we simulated the effect of doppler friction , and showed that the anomalous character of the diffusion is kept unchanged , at least for a certain reasonable set of parameters .",
    "however , a general rule on the influence of doppler cooling is not yet established , and an experimentalist with a specific set of parameters in mind might wish to test numerically the magnitude of this effect on the anomalous spreading .",
    "an interesting approach was recently suggested by dechant and lutz @xcite .",
    "they investigated the multi - fractal nature of the moments @xmath578 of the process and consider initial conditions different than ours .",
    "they assume that in a first stage , of duration @xmath579 , the particles are cooled in a confining field ( which inhibits the spreading ) .",
    "then the momentum of particles relaxes to a state described by the infinite covariant density @xcite which depends on @xmath579 .",
    "the particles are then released and their spreading is recorded for a duration @xmath53 .",
    "we considered the case @xmath580 while ref .",
    "@xcite considers the opposite case .",
    "at - least the experiment in @xcite is conducted under the conditions investigated here , namely that the spreading time is much longer than the preparation time . as shown by hirschberg et al . , starting with power law distributions will dramatically influence the spreading , both in momentum space @xcite and in space .",
    "indeed large @xmath579 implies power law initial conditions , eq .",
    "( [ eqequil ] ) , with a @xmath579 dependent cutoff @xcite . in that sense",

    "<S> lvy flights are random walks in which the probability distribution of the step sizes is fat - tailed . </S>",
    "<S> lvy spatial diffusion has been observed for a collection of ultra - cold @xmath0rb atoms and single @xmath1mg@xmath2 ions in an optical lattice , a system which allows for a unique degree of control of the dynamics . using the semiclassical theory of sisyphus cooling </S>",
    "<S> , we formulate the problem as a coupled lvy walk , with strong correlations between the length @xmath3 and duration @xmath4 of the excursions . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly the problem is related to the area under the bessel and brownian excursions . </S>",
    "<S> these are overdamped langevin motions that start and end at the origin , constrained to remain positive , in the presence or absence of an external logarithmic potential , respectively . in the limit of a weak potential , i.e. , shallow optical lattices , the celebrated airy distribution describing the areal distribution of the brownian excursion is found as a limiting case . </S>",
    "<S> three distinct phases of the dynamics are investigated : normal diffusion , lvy diffusion and , below a certain critical depth of the optical potential , @xmath5 scaling , which is related to richardson s diffusion from the field of turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the main focus of the paper is the analytical calculation of the joint probability density function @xmath6 from a newly developed theory of the area under the bessel excursion . </S>",
    "<S> the latter describes the spatiotemporal correlations in the problem and is the microscopic input needed to characterize the spatial diffusion of the atomic cloud . </S>",
    "<S> a modified montroll - weiss equation for the fourier - laplace transform of the density @xmath7 is obtained , which depends on the statistics of velocity excursions and meanders . </S>",
    "<S> the meander , a random walk in velocity space , which starts at the origin and does not cross it , describes the last jump event @xmath3 in the sequence . in the anomalous phases , the statistics of meanders and excursions are essential for the calculation of the mean square displacement , indicating that our correction to the montroll - weiss equation is crucial , and pointing to the sensitivity of the transport on a single jump event . </S>",
    "<S> our work provides general relations between the statistics of velocity excursions and meanders and that of the diffusivity , both for normal and anomalous processes . </S>"
