    "the exclusive decay @xmath5 will play a central role in the near future at lhcb and also at super - lhcb .",
    "this channel is particularly interesting because it provides information in different ways .",
    "it is used as a basis to construct different type of observables , such as the forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry @xcite , the isospin asymmetry @xcite and the angular distribution observables @xcite . here",
    ", we will focus on the observables derived from the 4-body decay distribution : @xmath6 that provides information on the k * spin amplitudes .",
    "the starting point is the differential decay distribution of the decay @xmath7 .",
    "this distribution with the @xmath8 on the mass shell is described by @xmath9 and three angles @xmath10 ( angle between @xmath11 and the direction of the outgoing @xmath12 in @xmath13 frame ) , @xmath14 ( angle between @xmath15 and outgoing @xmath12 in @xmath16 frame ) and @xmath17 ( angle between the two planes ) , @xmath18 where @xmath19 in the massless limit the i s are function of the k * spin amplitudes@xcite @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , we have then 6 complex amplitudes , four symmetries ( see @xcite ) and 9 @xmath23 parameters , of which 8 are independent . at this point",
    "we can follow two alternatives to construct observables : a ) fit the parameters i s , use them as observables , and compare the predictions with data or b ) use the spin amplitudes as the key ingredient to construct a selected group of observables .",
    "the first option ( ` a')@xcite is experimentally problematic as the resultant fit fails to capture the correlation between the i s induced by the underlying k * spin amplitudes .",
    "the second option ( ` b')@xcite aims at constructing selected observables from the k * spin amplitudes that are extracted directly from the experimental fit .",
    "certain criteria are considered : maximal sensitivity to right - handed currents ( rh ) , minimal sensitivity to poorly known soft form factors , and good experimental resolution .",
    "we will always follow option ` b'@xcite .",
    "the procedure in this case is the following : choose the combination of spin amplitudes with maximal sensitivity to rh currents ; check if the combination fulfills all symmetries ; and finally , analyse the observables and new physics ( np ) impact .",
    "notice that these combinations of spin amplitudes may be simple functions of the i s ( see @xcite ) or highly non - linear combinations showing up an interesting sensitivity to np ( see @xcite for an example ) .",
    "the keypoint is the evaluation of the relevant matrix elements that in naive factorization are functions of the form factors @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "then the spin amplitudes @xmath27 can be written in terms of these form factors and the wilson coefficients @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 of an effective hamiltonian that includes rh currents via the electromagnetic dipole operator @xmath32 : @xmath33 \\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath34 \\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath35 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we are left again with two possible choices : either i ) use qcd light cone sum rules ( lcsr ) to estimate the required form factors adding the @xmath36 corrections from qcdf or ii ) work consistently in the same framework of qcdf at lo and nlo @xcite and include a reasonable conservative size for the possible @xmath37 corrections . the first option ( ` i')@xcite implies neglecting some @xmath38 corrections to qcdf and assume that the main part of those corrections are inside the soft form factors evaluated with qcd lcsr . the second option ( ` ii')@xcite",
    "allows us to explore the impact that @xmath38 corrections have on the observables .    in the limit @xmath39 and",
    "@xmath40 all form factors are related to only two soft form factors @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite and consequently transversity amplitudes simplify enormously ; then observables can be easily constructed in which the soft form factors cancel out completely at lo : @xmath43\\xi_{\\bot}(e_\\kstar ) , \\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath44\\xi_{\\bot}(e_\\kstar ) , \\nonumber\\ ] ] [ lel : tranversity : zero ] * a_0l , r*= - ( 1-)^2_(e _ ) , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "finally , our bsm testing ground model will be a supersymmetric model with non - minimal flavour violation in the down squark sector that induces rh currents@xcite .",
    "we will focus on two scenarios@xcite :    *   * scenario a * : large - gluino and positive mass insertion scenario : @xmath48 , @xmath49 \\rm gev$ ] , . curve ( a ) : @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "curve ( b ) : @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "*   * scenario b : * low - gluino mass or large squark mass : @xmath54 , @xmath55 \\rm gev$ ] . curve ( c ) : @xmath56 , @xmath57",
    ". curve ( d ) : @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "we also take : @xmath60 and @xmath61 . all relevant constraints",
    "( coming from _ b _ physics rare decays @xmath62 parameter , higgs mass , susy particle searches , vacuum stability , etc . )",
    "have also been checked .",
    "in the framework of qcdf at nlo we evaluate the k * spin amplitudes to include @xmath36 contributions to form factors , adding also possible @xmath37 corrections according to option ` ( ii)'@xcite .",
    "we are then in the position to construct observables out of these spin amplitudes , the so called ` transverse and transverse / longitudinal asymmetries ' @xcite : @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in order to fully understand the behaviour of these observables",
    "it is very illuminating to analyze them in the large recoil limit using the heavy quark and large-@xmath63 expressions for the spin amplitudes .",
    "this is the main goal of this section .",
    "the transverse asymmetry @xmath1 , first proposed in @xcite , probes the transverse spin amplitude @xmath64 in a controlled way .",
    "it is defined by @xcite : @xmath65 this observable has a particularly simple form if one uses the heavy quark and large-@xmath63 limit for the transverse amplitudes : @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "it is then clear that in this observable @xmath68 form factor dependence cancels at lo and the sensitivity to @xmath69 is maximal .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the low - dilepton mass region @xmath70 gev@xmath71 .",
    "we show that the most relevant features arise already at lo .",
    "we will model the presence of np using a non - zero contribution to the chirally flipped operator @xmath72 according to the previous section .",
    "* @xmath1 is sensitive to both the modulus and sign of @xmath73 , being approximately zero in the sm .",
    "this sensitivity is enhanced by a factor @xmath74 at low @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) , and for larger values of @xmath75 ( @xmath77 ) the observable decreases with a @xmath78 slope .",
    "this is clearly shown in fig.1 looking at the curves , a , b , c and d. * finally @xmath1 exhibits a zero , at the point @xmath79 corresponding exactly to the zero of the fb asymmetry at lo .",
    "being this zero independent of @xmath80 , all curves with sm - like @xmath81 should exhibit it ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "finally it was shown in @xcite that contrary to the case of @xmath1 the observable @xmath82 does not show any remarkable sensitivity to the presence of rh currents .",
    "this stress the importance of @xmath1 as one of the best indicators of the presence of this type of np .    in summary",
    "@xmath1 provides different informations depending on the region of @xmath75 analyzed : at low @xmath75 ( @xmath83 ) basically sets the size of the coefficient @xmath84 and at high @xmath75 ( @xmath85 ) behaves as the fb asymmetry , with a zero in the energy axis .",
    "this last point implies obviously , that in case of a flipped sign solution for @xmath86 the behaviour of @xmath1 will change drastically .",
    "this is shown by the grey curve in fig.1a that does not have a zero , like in the fb asymmetry . in this sense @xmath1",
    "goes beyond the @xmath82 because it contains the most important features of this observable and also show up a dramatic dependence on the presence of rh currents ( @xmath87 ) invisible to @xmath82 .",
    "( a ) , @xmath2(b ) and @xmath3(c ) in sm and susy ( curves _ a_,_b_,_c_,_d _ ) .",
    "the outer dark and light ( green ) bands are , respectively , the possible 5 and 10% @xmath37 corrections to the amplitudes , varied independently for each amplitude and added in quadrature .",
    "the inner ( orange ) band around the sm prediction ( black curve ) contains the hadronic and renormalisation scale uncertainties , also added in quadrature .",

    "the grey curve corresponds to the flipped sign solution @xmath88,title=\"fig:\",width=151,height=113 ]    a similar exercise can be done with the observables @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "those are particularly interesting because they open the sensitivity to the longitudinal spin amplitude @xmath89 minimizing , at the same time , the sensitivity to the other soft form factor @xmath90",
    ".    both can be very easily measured from the angular distribution and their explicit form in the heavy quark and large-@xmath63 limit for the spin amplitudes , even if less iluminating , still shows clearly the different way they depend on the rh currents .",
    "they are : @xmath91 where @xmath92 with @xmath93 @xcite are simple functions of these coefficients and @xmath94 . here",
    "a small weak phase has been neglected . as can be seen from their defining expressions and from the figs .",
    "1b-1c , @xmath2 and @xmath3 play a complementary role , where @xmath2 shows a minimum @xmath3 has a maximum , and viceversa .",
    "for example , in the specific susy cases discussed , it is clear from figs . 1a-1b that the low - gluino scenario with negative mass insertion is clearly enhanced in the low-@xmath75 region for @xmath3 , while the large - gluino scenario with positive mass insertion is clearly signaled in the low-@xmath75 region for @xmath2 and in the large-@xmath75 region for @xmath3 . finally , from the set of functions @xmath95@xcite it is easy at lo to obtain with good precision the position of the maxima / minima .",
    "the way the sensitivity to rh currents is manifested is through the position of the maxima / minima in @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in the case of the flipped sign solution ( grey curve of fig .",
    "1 ) this is shown also by the position of more prominent peak in @xmath3 ( as seen in fig 1c ) .",
    "the same philosophy as in @xcite can be applied to cp violating observables ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "finally the excellent experimental sensitivity at lhcb specially for @xmath1 from a full angular analysis will allow to disentangle cleanly the presence of rh currents @xcite . + * acknowledgments : * jm and mr acknowledge financial support from fpa2008 - 01430 and mrtn - ct-2006 - 035482 and also from uab , ue and wr from stfc , th acknowledges financial support from heptools and the itp of the university zurich .",
