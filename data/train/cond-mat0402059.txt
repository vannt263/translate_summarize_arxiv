    "as the molecule that carries all genetic information , dna has been of great interest to chemists and physicists since before the unlocking of its structure by watson and crick @xcite , and both the structure and dynamics of the molecule have been investigated in great detail .",
    "another key feature of dna is the ease of its assembly as a linear macro - molecule of truly macroscopic scale ; a potential realisation of a quantum wire ( if it were a conductor ) .",
    "one can also use the dna molecule as a scaffold to grow quantum wires , e.g. , by deposition of conducting molecules in the minor groove.@xcite    with the experiments by dekker and his group @xcite on the conduction of single strands of dna , and the controversy about the interpretation of the experiments , which suggested that dna might be a conductor , a veritable floodgate for theoretical studies has opened .",
    "most of these consider the conduction ( or charge transport ) along a one - dimensional `` pi - stack '' ( a channel built from overlapping pi orbitals ) in the centre of the dna molecule .",
    "disregarding electronic transport , mathematical modelling of dna has a long tradition , see for example the book ref .",
    "@xcite . in recent years the peyrard - bishop model ( a simple two - dimensional model for dna , which has been used successfully to describe the denaturing transition of that molecule ) has become quite popular , see the review in @xcite for a more complete set of references .",
    "et al _ @xcite have produced models which allow them to perform mathematical studies of dna and its properties .",
    "this is an active field , and the number of relevant publications is large . the most relevant literature can be traced from a number of recent references , e.g. , refs . @xcite and the review @xcite .",
    "recently one of the present authors ( together with dr .",
    "hartmann ) @xcite looked at the model of mingaleev _ et al _ and proposed a further generalisation of their one chain model to two chains .",
    "this two chain generalisation involved similar terms in the lagrangian ( for each chain ) to those of the model of mingaleev _ et al _ plus an extra term involving the interaction between the chains .",
    "the obtained results were encouraging , although due to the specific choice of terms , the numerical simulations were very slow .",
    "in this note we reinvestigate these models and propose a new generalisation which , at least , has the advantage of fast numerical convergence .",
    "we use this model to investigate various aspects of dna - like substances .",
    "our model can be compared to the model used by bishop _",
    "@xcite , but differs in many aspects .",
    "the two most crucial ones are the inclusion of the helicity of the molecule and the fact that in our model electrons are ( correctly or incorrectly , that remains to be seen ) allowed to propagate along the backbone rather than along the `` pi - stack '' of the overlapping molecular orbitals of the base pairs .",
    "the latter assumption is already quite old , and was first proposed by eley @xcite in 1962 . in this work",
    "we concentrate our attention on the mathematical aspects of the problem postponing detailed aspects of the applicability of the model to real , physical and biological , systems to a further publication .    in the next section",
    "we say a few words about the dna systems and in the following section we describe our ideas of how to build a model for dna - inspired structures which can be used to describe such systems .    in the final section",
    "we describe in detail our first studies involving this model .",
    "the basic structure of dna varies quite considerably depending on its environment .",
    "b - dna , the standard double helix , actually only occurs in aqueous solution .",
    "an idealised structure of dna is given in figure [ fig : bdna ] .    a schematic model of b - dna , height=377 ]    we can easily see that each base pair advances the rotation of the chain by about @xmath1 .",
    "the difference between the major and minor grooves is caused by the fact that the base - pairs are not exactly at right angles to the backbone .",
    "there is also a `` propeller twist '' : the plane of the base pairs is twisted like a propeller .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details . as can be seen in the figure ,",
    "the different base pairs are quite close in the centre of the molecule .",
    "this is why it is believed that dna gains rigidity by overlapping pi - orbitals between the different base pairs .",
    "this same mechanism has been invoked in allowing charge transport through dna .",
    "our dna model will consist of two parts : a simple classical model of a chiral molecule , that can twist and be locally compressed , but where we disregard the bending modes .",
    "this would be a natural approach to a stretched dna molecule , attached between two electrical contacts .",
    "the situation is sketched schematically in figure  [ fig : dna1 ] . in that figure",
    "the thin ( red ) lines denote denote the hydrogen bonds , and are modelled to be at straight angles to the `` virtual backbone '' denoted by the dashed line .",
    "the thick ( blue and green ) lines denote the two dna chains .    at the same time",
    "we assume electrons hop from a base pair to a base pair , occasionally moving from one side to the other . our model for this process",
    "will be based on the discrete non - linear schrdinger equation , which can be seen as the semi - classical limit of a tight - binding model .",
    "we shall investigate the electronic model first , before concentrating on the molecular dynamics .",
    "we assume a simple discrete non - linear schrdinger equation for the movement of the electrons through dna .",
    "we model the electron as hopping along sites labelled @xmath2 , the position of a base on the back - bone .",
    "we have two electron fields , one on each ribbon , which we call @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( connected to the two sets of coordinates @xmath5 and @xmath6 described above ) .",
    "the action for the electrons , without coupling between the two chains , is taken to be @xmath7+\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left.\\sum_{i}\\left[\\hbar\\omega2\\left|\\phi_{i}\\right|^{2}-\\sum_{j\\neq i}j_{i - j}\\phi_{i}^{*}\\phi_{j}-\\frac{1}{2}\\chi\\left|\\phi_{i}\\right|^{4}\\right]\\right\\ } \\quad,\\label{eq : action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this can , for instance , be derived as the semi - classical limit of a tight - binding model , with a density - squared term added .",
    "such non - linearities are crucial , since they limit the amount of charge that can collect at any one site .",
    "it is not obvious that such non - linearities are restricted to the on - site interaction , and we could also study the question `` how different would the dynamics of the system be had we added an electronic term of the density - density correlation form @xmath8 ? '' we have no answer to this question - and we leave its resolution to some future work . in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on the study of the system essentially described by ( [ eq : action ] ) together with a further potential describing the interchain interaction .",
    "as we shall see this system is already sufficiently complicated to exhibit many interesting properties .      of course , one of the key elements of the problem is the interaction between the chains ( and we limit ourselves to consider only the interaction between the two nearest sites on the backbones , i.e. @xmath9 ) .",
    "the most naive choice of such an interaction is to take @xmath10 this form of the interchain interaction term is actually rather uninteresting since it leads to a simple oscillation of charges from one strand to the other , while their combination behaves as a single unit , and we would thus reproduce the usual results of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that eq .",
    "( [ eq : vint1 ] ) does not take into account the chirality of the molecules .",
    "a possible improvement would involve making the coupling orientation dependent : @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is yet another parameter ) .",
    "here @xmath13 is the angle of the @xmath2 sites on the backbones relative to some arbitrary direction ( see later ) .",
    "this is not satisfactory , however , since for a flat molecule the tunnelling would now depend on its orientation !",
    "we can think of two further improvements :    first of all we can subtract the average orientation , @xmath14 which leads to a rather non - local coupling .",
    "this rather artificial approach will not be further investigated in this work , since it is not related to the chirality of the dna molecule .",
    "secondly , we can invert the transformation of fields obtained from going from eq .",
    "( [ eq : vint1 ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq : vint2 ] ) , which corresponds to a gauge - like transformation of the naive interaction , eq .",
    "( [ eq : vint1 ] ) .",
    "this implies that we should make the replacement @xmath15 _ everywhere _",
    "( i.e. , also in all the interaction terms within each one of the backbones ) . for a flat molecule",
    "this has no consequence , and the orientation dependence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vint2 ] ) disappears , but for a curved molecule , as we shall show below , this indeed includes effects due to chirality .",
    "our modification then implies that we can use eq .",
    "( [ eq : vint1 ] ) , but must replace the non - local interaction along the backbone by @xmath16 this is obviously rotationally invariant .",
    "let us look at the continuum limit of @xmath17 and @xmath18 in order to see that this expression really describes a chiral molecule .",
    "the second term is simply related to the first by the replacement @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we thus concentrate on the first term , where we assume that @xmath21 falls sufficiently fast so that we need consider only the nearest - neighbour terms . calling the contribution of these terms , divided by @xmath22 , @xmath23 ,",
    "we find that @xmath24 next we assume that @xmath25 is small and we expand @xmath23 to first order in this quantity . before doing so",
    ", we introduce some time - saving notation , @xmath26 let s now expand and simplify @xmath27 @xmath28\\biggr)_{i}+\\text{c.c.}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we combine the `` onsite '' term @xmath29 in a similar term already present in the model , we find that the remaining terms become @xmath30 here @xmath31 , @xmath32 . in the last step we have added a second order term in @xmath33 ( neglected in our initial evaluation ) .",
    "thus we end up with a covariant derivative . the other chain ( @xmath4 )",
    "contains the complex conjugate covariant derivative , @xmath34 thus we see that with this structure of the coupling to a ` magnetic flux ' caused by the warping of the molecule through each plaquette , we have indeed constructed a chiral model of electrons moving through a molecule .",
    "first we shall study the discrete solitons ( breathers ) of the model , i.e. , solutions of the form @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "we assume that the distance between the molecules is specified by the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "this leads to the non - linear eigenvalue problem @xmath40 where the term containing @xmath41 denotes the coupling to the other chain .",
    "one of the ways this problem can be solved is through a constrained minimization , with @xmath42 being the lagrange multiplier imposing charge normalisation .",
    "we have studied the nature of such solutions , for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 we have found that the coupling between the two chains leads to solitons that are distributed evenly over the two backbones , but where the phase varies .",

    "looking at the figure , it seems easy to work with the following representation : ( we use @xmath65 to denote the position where the @xmath2th base pair is attached to one of the chains , @xmath66 for the other one ) @xmath67 with @xmath68 a 2d unit vector in the @xmath69 plane .",

    "we shall use a molecular potential to implement an approximate constraint on the spacing in the strands of dna , but it is not so straightforward to study the effect of bending of the double helix in this model , which could be quite important @xcite .",
    "the kinetic energy is relatively easy to evaluate @xmath73 we can easily generalise this to a dynamical @xmath72 ; in this case the length of each rung becomes @xmath74 , and the additional terms in the kinetic energy would be of the form @xmath75 . however , we expect the effects of the variation of @xmath72 to be small , so in this work we will keep @xmath72 fixed .",
    "we shall now describe a set of simple potentials , all corresponding to properties of the bonds or the angles between bonds , that can be used to describe equilibrium dna .",
    "if we insist on a molecule where the equilibrium shape is bent , such as dna , we must impose an equilibrium angle between the bonds .",

    "this is most easy to construct the continuum limit , where this translates into the requirement that the vector tangential to one of the strands points both upwards and into the plane , or in the opposite direction ( downwards and out of the plane ) .",
    "suppose that the point on the strand is specified by a vector @xmath77 from the back bone ( i.e. , @xmath77 lies in the @xmath69 plane ) , we write @xmath78 ( in the notation used above , @xmath79 , depending on which strand we are on ) , with @xmath80 we can then write for the tangent vector @xmath81 and , to introduce chirality , we wish to add a bias towards a particular value of @xmath82 in our model .",
    "we can extract @xmath83 by calculating @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",

    "an example of such a function which in fact we have used in our simulations , is @xmath93    we will also assume that each of the back - bones ( the strands ) can stretch ; this will be built into our model by introducing a stretching potential of the bonds of the form ( note that stretching for the other strand is constrained by the symmetry imposed by the straightness of our molecule ) @xmath94 where @xmath95 is has a minimum at the average distance @xmath96 , and increases quickly away from the minimum .",
    "as @xmath95 describes a stretching potential we can either use a harmonic potential , @xmath97 , or a morse potential , @xmath98 . in our simulations",
    "we have used the simple quadratic form @xmath99      before we proceed further we note that we can simplify the problem slightly by using a 1d angle representation for @xmath68 , @xmath100 we then find@xmath101 and @xmath102 as well as@xmath103    next we determine the equations of motion for all the fields of our system .",

    "the tunnelling rate is a function of the shortest distance between two spatial points , i.e. , @xmath110 , or 2 .",
    "the tunnelling rate depends on the distance along the dna backbone ( the sucrose molecules ) , @xmath111 .",
