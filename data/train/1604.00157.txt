    "dispersion of wave packets is usually considered as a hallmark of quantum systems .",
    "however , it can be avoided .",
    "the seek for non - dispersive quantum wave packets dates back to erwin schrdinger . in 1926",
    ", he introduced a wave function whose maximum of amplitude followed classical trajectory in the field of harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "later on , a non - dispersive ( but not normalizable ) wave function was constructed for a free particle system in terms of the airy functions @xcite .",
    "other milestones were carved by prediction and preparation of non - dispersive wave packets in experiments with the rydberg atoms .",
    "wave packets orbiting the atom were stabilized by an external periodic perturbation represented by a fine - tuned electromagnetic wave @xcite-@xcite .",
    "an analogous phenomenon was discussed recently in the context of many body systems where the wave packets were composed of quasi - particles @xcite .    a surprising variety of condensed matter systems shares one distinctive feature ; low - energy quasi - particles behave like massless or massive dirac fermions .",
    "these systems were coined as the dirac materials in the literature @xcite .",
    "the graphene , despite being a prominent representative of the family , is not its only member .",
    "the dirac fermions were predicted in the silicene , germanene or dichalcogenides @xcite-@xcite .",
    "they are present in high - temperature d - wave superconductors @xcite or superfluid phases of @xmath0he @xcite .",
    "the dirac fermions emerge naturally in the low - energy approximation of the tight - binding model of a generic hexagonal lattice @xcite .",
    "this fact can be utilized for preparation of the artificial graphene .",
    "it was created by confining ultracold atoms to hexagonal optical lattices @xcite-@xcite , by assembling carbon monoxide molecules into hexagonal lattices on a copper surface @xcite , by drilling holes into a plexiglas plate @xcite or simulated in other experiments with acoustic waves @xcite .",
    "see also a review article @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss a class of quantum systems where dispersion of the wave packets can be suppressed due to the symmetries and intrinsic spectral properties of the considered setting .",
    "first , we consider an abstract quantum system and specify sufficient conditions for hosting of the non - dispersive wave packets . a physical realization of a system described by the dirac equation is introduced later on .",
    "both numerical and qualitative analysis are carried on and an experimental realization is discussed .",

    ", we obtain @xmath7 the multiplicative factor @xmath8 guarantees unitarity of the mapping . the formula ( [ fpsi ] )",
    "can be understood as a generalization of the partial wave expansion for the case where the eigenvalues of @xmath5 are not quantized .",
    "the action of the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath9 here , @xmath10 should be understood as an operator acting in the @xmath11-variable only .",
    "it will be referred to as the _ fiber hamiltonian _",
    "later in the text . the formula ( [ eq : di_decomp ] ) says that in the partial momentum representation , our hamiltonian decomposes into the so - called direct integral of the fiber operators @xmath12 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "now , let us suppose that @xmath12 has a non - empty set of discrete eigenvalues for @xmath13 from an open interval @xmath14 .",
    "we denote them @xmath15 where the positive integer @xmath16 labels the energy bands . the associated normalized bound states",
    "@xmath17 satisfy @xmath18 if we suppose @xmath12 to be analytic in @xmath13 then the functions @xmath15 are analytic in @xmath13 as well @xcite .",
    "we can construct a wave function @xmath19 using the eigenstates corresponding to a single energy band @xmath15 , @xmath20 the coefficient function @xmath21 is supported by @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23 for all @xmath24 .",
    "we require @xmath25 to be normalized .",
    "this is guaranteed as long as @xmath26 .    in general , the wave packet ( [ psi_n ] )",
    "can get dispersed along the @xmath1-axis . however , by construction , @xmath27 has a remarkable transverse stability , it is dispersionless along the @xmath11-axis .",
    "this transverse stability does not stem from a fine interference of non - localized waves but from the fact that each @xmath17 is an eigenfunction of @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath28 in the first equality we used unitarity of @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the probability density of finding the particle at distance @xmath11 from the @xmath1-axis does not change with time .",
    "dispersion of the wave packets ( [ psi_n ] ) can be completely suppressed provided that @xmath15 is linear on the interval @xmath22 , @xmath29 then the wave packet @xmath27 has a _ soliton - like _ behavior ; it evolves with a uniform speed without any dispersion , @xmath30 indeed , we have @xmath31 in the first equality we view @xmath12 as an operator acting in both variables .",
    "it obeys @xmath32=0 $ ] , due to ( 1 ) .",
    "this implies the second equality where @xmath12 is already the fiber operator .",
    "hence , the wave packet moves uniformly with the speed @xmath33 that corresponds to the slope of the energy band @xmath15 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "when @xmath36 , the wave packet @xmath27 neither moves nor dissipates , it represents a stationary state of @xmath2 with energy @xmath37 .",
    "the existence of dispersionless wave packets ( [ psi_n ] ) is rather independent of the explicit form of @xmath2 .",
    "the only assumptions on @xmath2 are just the commutation relation ( [ eq : comm ] ) , which implies the decomposition , and the favorable spectral properties described by ( [ h(x , k)e ] ) . under these assumptions",
    ", @xmath27 does not disperse along @xmath11-axis as has been already discussed above .",
    "if , in addition , ( [ eq : lin_ev ] ) holds then @xmath27 is dispersionless in the both directions and moves along the @xmath1-axis with the uniform velocity @xmath33 .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize the framework to a multidimensional hamiltonian . if @xmath38 and @xmath39 are multidimensional vectors of not necessarily the same dimension , @xmath40=0 $ ] , and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , then the wave packet @xmath27 will be dispersionless and moving in @xmath43space with the velocity vector @xmath44 .    though we are not aware of any non - relativistic system where ( [ eq : lin_ev ] ) would take place , there is an elegant way how to guarantee existence of a _ globally _ linear energy band in the dirac materials under some specific conditions .",
    "we shall discuss it in section [ model ] .",
    "in this section , we consider perturbations of a system hosting dispersionless wave packets .",
    "we consider two scenarios .",
    "firstly , the perturbation is taken into the account implicitly as the cause for the breakdown of the linear dispersion relation ( [ eq : lin_ev ] ) . in the second case , we study the effect of a weak perturbation @xmath45 on the propagation of the wave packets . in both cases ,",
    "we compare the exact time evolution of the wave packet @xmath27 affected by the perturbation with the wave packet @xmath27 evolving in a soliton - like manner with a uniform speed @xmath46 .",
    "our goal is to specify the transition amplitude @xmath47 and to determine the optimal value of @xmath46 that maximizes the transition probability @xmath48 .",
    "this value would approximate the speed of propagation of the dispersing wave packet .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath15 is not linear .",
    "then the wave packet can still disperse very slowly along the @xmath1-axis provided that @xmath15 is well approximated by a linear function on the interval @xmath49 .",
    "we denote the deviation of the energy band @xmath15 from a linear function by @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath46 are some real constants .",
    "then a straightforward calculation reveals that latexmath:[\\[\\label{a_def }    notice that the integrand does not depend on @xmath51 .",
    "a short analysis of the stationary equation @xmath53 shows that the maximizing value of @xmath46 depends on @xmath54 and @xmath55 and can not be , in general , written in a closed form . for small values of @xmath55",
    ", it is given approximately by @xmath56 averaged over @xmath57 with the weight @xmath58 .",
    "let us find an estimate for @xmath46 that would be reasonably simple and accurate , yet possibly not maximizing @xmath48 .",
    "to this purpose we start with the following estimates @xmath59 now we find the value of @xmath46 that maximizes the lower bound .",
    "this can be done in a straightforward manner if @xmath60 is chosen in a way that for all @xmath35 , the graph of @xmath15 lies under or above the line segment connecting its endpoints",
    ". then coincides with and the expression can be optimized by putting @xmath46 equal to the averaged _ group velocity _ , i.e. , @xmath61 the value of @xmath51 is then to be fixed so that @xmath62 goes in the middle of the narrowest strip containing @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "the approximation of @xmath46 by the averaged group velocity is in a very good agreement with our numerical results depicted in fig .",

    "we also plotted there the transition probability @xmath48 ( with @xmath46 given by ) for the three definite choices of @xmath27 .",
    "now , let us turn our attention to the second scenario in which the hamiltonian decomposes as follows @xmath64 where the system described by @xmath65 can host dispersionless wave packets and @xmath66 is a bounded symmetric operator , e.g. , the multiplication operator by a bounded real function , that plays role of a perturbation . in order to describe the time evolution of the system with the hamiltonian @xmath67 ,",
