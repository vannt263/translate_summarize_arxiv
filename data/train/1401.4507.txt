    "i first became aware that there is a deep problem at the heart of physics in a first year chemistry class .",
    "the instructor began his very first lecture by writing an equation on the board : @xmath0 \\psi(r , t),\\label{eq : schrodinger}\\ ] ] and asked if anyone knew what this was . when no one did , he continued by saying that this was the schrdinger equation , the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics , and that chemisty , biology and everything around us is a consequence of this equation .",
    "he then concluded ( perhaps hyperbolically ) by saying that the only problem is that no one knows how to solve it in general and for this reason we had to learn chemistry . for me , this lesson raised an important question : how can we be certain that the schrdinger equation correctly describes the dynamics of these systems if solving it is computationally intractable ?",
    "this is the central question of this article , and in the course of addressing it we will not only challenge prevailing views of experimental quantum physics but also see that computer science is fundamental to the foundations of science .",
    "the essence of the problem is that relatively simple quantum systems , such as chemicals or spin lattices , seem to be performing tasks that are well beyond the capabilities of any conceivable supercomputer .",
    "this may come as a surprise since   is a linear partial differential equation that can be solved in time polynomial in the dimension of the vector @xmath1 , which represents the `` quantum state '' of an ensemble of particles .",
    "the problem is that the dimension of the vector @xmath1 grows exponentially with the number of interacting particles .",
    "this means that even writing down the solution to the schr \" odinger equation is exponentially expensive , let alone performing the operations needed to solve it .",
    "richard feynman was perhaps the first person to clearly articulate that this computational intractability actually poses an opportunity for computer science  @xcite .",
    "he suspected that these seemingly intractable problems in quantum simulation could only be addressed by using a computer that possesses quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement .",
    "this conjecture motivated the field of quantum computing , which is the study of computers that operate according to quantum mechanical principles .",
    "the fact that quantum computing has profound implications for computer science was most famously demonstrated by shor s factoring algorithm , which runs in polynomial time  @xcite whereas no polynomial time algorithm currently exists for factoring .",
    "this raises the possibility that a fast scalable quantum computer might be able to easily break the cryptography protocols that make secure communication over the internet possible .",
    "subsequently , feyman s intuition was shown to be correct by seth lloyd  @xcite , who showed that quantum computers can provide exponential advantages ( over the best known algorithms ) for simulating broad classes of quantum systems .",
    "exponential advantages over existing algorithms have also been shown for certain problems related to random walks  @xcite , matrix inversion  @xcite and quantum chemistry  @xcite , to name a few .    at present , no one has constructed a scalable quantum computer .",
    "the main problem is that although quantum information is very flexible it is also very fragile . even looking at a quantum system",
    "can irreversibly damage the information that it carries . as an example , let s imagine that you want to see a stationary electron . in order to do so",
    ", you must hit it with a photon .",
    "the photon must carry a substantial amount of energy ( relative to the electron s mass ) to measure the position precisely and so the interaction between the photon and electron will impart substantial momentum ; thereby causing the electron s momentum to become uncertain .",
    "such effects are completely negligible for macroscopic objects , like a car , because of they have substantial mass ; whereas , these effects are significant in microscopic systems .",
    "this behavior is by no means unique to photons and electrons : the laws of quantum mechanics explicitly forbid learning information about a _",
    "general _ quantum state without disturbing it .",
    "this extreme hypersensitivity means that quantum devices can lose their quantum properties on a very short time scale ( typically a few milliseconds or microseconds depending on the system ) .",
    "quantum error correction strategies can correct such problems  @xcite .",
    "the remaining challenge is that the error rates in quantum operations are still not low enough ( with existing scalable architectures ) for such error correction schemes to correct more error than they introduce .",
    "nonetheless , scalable quantum computer designs already operate close to this `` threshold '' regime where quantum error correction can lead to arbitrarily long ( and arbitrarily accurate ) quantum computation  @xcite .    what provides quantum computing with its power ?",
    "quantum computing superficially looks very much like probabilistic computing  @xcite . rather than having definite bit strings ,",
    "a quantum computer s data is stored as a quantum superposition of different bit strings .",
    "for example , if @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the vector transpose ) then the state @xmath5 is a valid state for a single quantum bit . this quantum bit or",
    "`` qubit '' can be interpretted as being simultaneously 0 and 1 with equal weight . in this case , if the state of the qubit is measured ( in the computational basis ) then the user will read @xmath6 with @xmath7 probability and @xmath8 with @xmath7 probability .",
    "quantum computers are not just limited to having equal `` superpositions '' of zero and one .",
    "arbitrary linear combinations are possible and the probability of measuring the quantum bitstring in the quantum computer to be @xmath9 ( in decimal ) is @xmath10 for any unit vector @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , although quantum states are analog ( in the sense that they allow arbitrary weighted combinations of bit strings ) the measurement outcomes will always be discrete , similar to probabilistic computing .",
    "the commonalities with probabilistic computation go only so far .",
    "quantum states are allowed to be complex vectors ( i.e. @xmath12 ) with the restriction that @xmath13 ( here @xmath14 is the conjugate  transpose operation ) ; furthermore , any attempt to recast the quantum state as a probability density function will result ( for almost all `` pure '' quantum states ) in a quasi  probability distribution that has negative probability density for certain ( not directly observable ) outcomes  @xcite .",
    "the state in a quantum computer is therefore fundamentally distinct from that of a probabilistic computer .",
    "in essence , a quantum computer is a device that can approximate arbitrary rotations on an input quantum state vector and measure the result . of course giving a quantum computer the ability to perform _ any _",
    "rotation is unrealistic .",
    "a quantum computer instead is required to approximate these rotations using a discrete set of gates .",
    "the quantum gate set that is conceptually simplest consists of only two gates : the controlled  controlled not ( the toffoli gate ) , which can perform any reversible boolean circuit , and an extra quantum gate known as the hadamard gate @xmath15 .",
    "this extra gate promotes a conventional computer to a quantum computer .",
    "the hadamard gate which is a linear operator that has the following action on the `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' quantum bit states : @xmath16 in other words , this gate maps a zero  bit to an equal weight superposition of zero and one and maps a one  bit to a similar vector but with an opposite sign on one of the components .",
    "the toffoli gate is a three  qubit linear operator that , at a logical level , acts non  trivially on only two computational basis vectors ( i.e. bit string inputs ) : @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "all other inputs , such as @xmath19 , are mapped to themselves by the controlled  controlled not gate . using the language of quantum state vectors ,",
    "the action of the toffoli gate on the two  dimensional subspace that it acts non  trivially upon is @xmath20    this finite set of gates is universal , meaning that any valid transformation of the quantum state vector can be implemented within arbitrarily small error using a finite sequence of these gates  @xcite .",
    "these gates are also reversible , meaning that any quantum algorithm that only uses the hadamard and toffoli gates and no measurement can be inverted .",
    "i will make use of this invertibility later when we discuss inferring models for quantum dynamical systems .",
    "measurement is different from the operations described above . the laws of quantum mechanics require that any attempt to extract information from a generic quantum state will necessarily disturb it .",
    "measurements in quantum computing reflect this principle by forcing the system to _ irreversibly _ collapse to a computational basis vector ( i.e. it becomes a quantum state that holds an ordinary bit string ) .",
    "for example , upon measurement @xmath21^t & \\text{with $ p=2/3 $ } \\\\\\\\ [ 0,1]^t & \\text{with $ p=1/3 $ }   \\end{cases},\\ ] ] where @xmath22^t$ ] represents logical @xmath23 and @xmath24^t$ ] is the logical @xmath25 state .",
    "there clearly is no way to invert this procedure . in this sense ,",
    "the act of measurement is just like flipping a coin .",
    "until you look at the coin , you can assign a prior probability distribution to it either being heads or tails , and upon measurement the distribution similarly `` collapses '' to either a heads or tails result .",
    "quantum computation thus combines elements of reversible computing with probabilistic computing wherein the inclusion of the hadamard gate introduces both the ability to have non  positive quantum state vectors and superposition ( the ability for quantum bits to be in the state 0 and 1 simultaneously ) and thereby promotes the system to a universal quantum computer . although quantum computing is distinct from probabilistic computing , it is unclear whether quantum computation is fundamentally more powerful . using the language of complexity theory , it is known that the class of decision problems that a quantum computer can solve efficiently with success probability greater than @xmath26 , , obeys @xmath27",
    "here is the class of decision problems that can be efficiently solved with success probability greater than @xmath26 using a probabilistic turing machine , and is the class of problems that can be solved using polynomial space and ( possibly ) exponential time using a deterministic turing machine .",
    "it is _ strongly _ believed that @xmath28 since exponential separations exist between the number of times that quantum algorithms and the best possible conventional algorithms have to query an oracle to solve certain problems  @xcite ; however , the precise relationship between the complexity classes remains unknown .",
    "the apparent difficulty of simulating large quantum systems creates an interesting dilemma for quantum computing : although true quantum computers are outside of our capabilities at present , it would appear that purpose built analog devices could be used to solve problems that are truly difficult for conventional computers .",
    "recent experiments by the nist group have demonstrated that a two  dimensional lattice of ions with over two hundred and seventeen ions with programmable interactions can be created  @xcite .",
    "this device can be thought of as a sort of _ analog quantum simulator _ in the sense that these interactions can be chosen such that the system of ions approximate the dynamics of certain condensed physics models known as ising models .",
    "on the surface , it would seem that this system of ions may be performing calculations that are beyond the reach of any conceivable supercomputer .",
    "if the quantum state for such a system were `` pure '' ( which roughly speaking means that it is an entirely quantum mixture ) then the state vector would be in @xmath29 .",
    "if the quantum state vector were expressed as an array of single precision floating point numbers then the resultant array would occupy roughly @xmath30 megabytes of memory .",
    "it is inconceivable that a conventional computer could even store this vector , let alone solve the corresponding schrdinger equation .",
    "a conventional computer does provide us with something that the analog simulator does not : the knowledge that we can trust the computer s results .",
    "the analog simulator has virtually no guarantees attached that the dynamical model that physicists believe describes the system is actually correct to a fixed number of digits of accuracy . finding a way to use computers to inexpensively certify that such quantum devices function properly not only remains an important challenge facing the development of new quantum technologies but it also poses a fundamental restriction on our abilities to understand the dynamics of large quantum systems ,",
    "provided that feynman s conjecture is correct .",
    "in essence , the central question of this paper is that of whether we can practically test quantum mechanical models for large quantum systems .",
    "although this is a question about physics , it can only be resolved by using the tools computer science . in particular",
    ", we will see that formal costs can be assigned to model inference and that computational complexity theory can provide profound insights about the limitations of our ability to model nature using computers .",
    "the importance of computational complexity to the foundations of physics has only recently been observed .",
    "in particular , the apparent emergence of thermodynamics in closed quantum systems is , in some cases , a consequence of the cost of distinguishing the `` true '' quantum mechanical probability distribution from the thermodynamical predictions scaling exponentially with the number of particles in the ensemble  @xcite .",
    "this is especially intriguing since it provides further evidence for the long held conjecture that there is an intimate link between the laws of thermodynamics in physics and computational complexity  @xcite .",
    "the problem of modeling , or certifying , quantum systems is essentially the problem of distinguishing distributions .",
    "although the problem of distinguishing distributions has long been solved , the problem of doing so under particular operational restrictions can actually be surprisingly subtle ( even in the absence of quantum effects ) .",
    "to see this , consider the following problem of deciding whether a device yields samples from a probability distribution @xmath31 or from another distribution @xmath32 .",
    "the probability of correctly distinguishing which one of two possible discrete probability distributions @xmath31 and @xmath32 based on a single sample , using the best possible data processing technique , is given by the variational distance : @xmath33 given any non  zero bias in this measurement , the chernoff bound shows that the success probability can be boosted to nearly @xmath34 by repeating the experiment a logarithmically large number of times .    for typical quantum systems",
    ", @xmath35 is of order one  @xcite which means that in principle such systems are easy to distinguish . in practice , the processing method that efficiently distinguishes @xmath31 from @xmath32 may be impractically difficult to find in quantum mechanical problems . thus distinguishing typical quantum systems can still be challenging .    as a motivating example , assume that you have a dice with @xmath36 sides that is promised to either be fair ( i.e. @xmath37 ) or that the probability distribution describing the dice was itself randomly drawn from another distribution such that @xmath38 and the variance in the probabilities obeys @xmath39 .",
    "this problem is substantially different from the base problem of distinguishing two known distributions because @xmath32 is unknown but information about the distribution that @xmath32 is drawn from is known .",
    "a number of samples that scales at least as the fourth  root of the dimension are needed to distinguish the distributions with high probability ( over samples and @xmath31 )  @xcite .",
    "this problem is not necessarily hard : a rough lower bound on the number of samples needed is @xmath40 .",
    "distinguishing typical probability distributions that arise from quantum mechanics from the uniform distribution is similar to the dice problem except that in large quantum systems `` the dice '' may have @xmath41 sides or more . in the aforementioned example",
    "a minimum of roughly @xmath42 samples will be needed to distinguish a quantum distribution from the uniform distribution with probability greater than @xmath26  @xcite . although collecting @xmath43 samples may already be prohibitively large , the number of samples needed at least doubles for every @xmath44 qubits that are added to the quantum system .",
    "this means that distinguishing typical quantum probability becomes prohibitively expensive as quantum bits ( i.e. particles ) are added to the system , despite the fact that @xmath35 is of order one .    in short ,",
    "quantum dynamics tend to rapidly scramble an initial quantum state vector , causing the predictions of different quantum mechanical models to become practically indistinguishable given limited computational resources .",
    "we will see below that complexity theory provides strong justification for the impracticality of distinguishing quantum distributions in general . in the following",
    "i will assume that the reader is familiar with standard complexity classes @xmath45 , @xmath46 , the polynomial hierarchy , @xmath47 and so forth . for brevity , the term efficient will mean `` in polynomial time '' .",
    "scott aaronson and alex arkhipov provided the strongest evidence yet that quantum systems exist that are exponentially difficult to simulate using conventional computers in their seminal 2011 paper on `` boson sampling ''  @xcite .",
    "their work proposes a simple experiment that directly challenges the extended church  turing thesis , which conjectures that any physically realistic model of computation can be efficiently simulated using a probabilistic turing machine .",
    "their boson sampler device is not universal and is trivial to simulate using a quantum computer .",
    "the remarkable feature of this device is that it draws samples from a distribution that a conventional computer can not efficiently draw samples from under reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions . in particular ,",
    "an efficient algorithm to sample from an arbitrary boson sampler s outcome distribution would cause the polynomial hierarchy to collapse to the third level , which is widely conjectured to be impossible .",
    "a boson sampling experiment involves preparing @xmath48 photons ( which are bosons ) in @xmath48 different inputs of a network of beam splitters , which are pieces of glass that partially reflect and transmit each incident photon .",
    "an illustration of this device is given in ( a ) .",
    "the boson sampler is analogous to the galton board , which is a device that can be used to approximately sample from the binomial distribution .",
    "the main difference between them is that the negativity of the quantum state ( manifested as interference between the photons ) causes the resultant distribution to be much harder to compute than the binomial distribution , as we will discuss shortly . at the end of the protocol ,",
    "detectors placed in each of @xmath49 different possible output `` modes '' count the number of photons that exit in each mode .",
    "the sampling problem that needs to be solved in order to simulate the action of a boson sampler is as follows .",
    "let @xmath50 be the transition matrix mapping the input state to the output state for the boson sampling device .",
    "let us define @xmath51 to be the experimental outcome observed , i.e. a list of the number of photons observed in mode @xmath52 .",
    "then let @xmath53 be the matrix that has @xmath54 copies of the first row of @xmath55 , @xmath56 copies of the second and so forth .",
    "then the probability distribution over @xmath57 given @xmath55 is  @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the permanent of a matrix , which is like a determinant with the exception that positive cofactors are always used in the expansion by minors step .",
    "it is important to note , however , that a quantum computer is not known to be able to efficiently learn these probabilities and in turn the permanent .",
    "permanent approximation is known to be @xmath47 complete  @xcite , where @xmath47 is the class of problems associated with counting the number of satisfying assignments to problems whose solutions can be verified efficiently .",
    "such problems can be extremely challenging ( much harder than factoring in the worst cases ) , which strongly suggests that the distribution for these experiments will be hard to find for certain cases if @xmath60 .",
    "the work of aaronson and arkhipov use the hardness of permanent approximation ( albeit indirectly ) to show that even drawing a sample from this distribution can be computationally hard under reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions .",
    "in contrast , drawing a sample from the quantum device is easy ( modulo the engineering challenges involved in preparing and detecting single photons  @xcite ) since it involves only measuring the number of photons that leave the boson sampling device in each of the @xmath49 possible modes .",
    "this provides a compelling reason to believe that there are simple physical processes that are too difficult to simulate using any conceivable conventional computer .",
    "although the boson sampling distribution can be hard to compute , it can be easily to distinguished from the uniform distribution because information is known about the asymptotic form of the distribution is known  @xcite . despite this",
    ", there are other distributions that are easy to sample from but are hard to distinguish from typical boson sampling distributions  @xcite .",
    "thus certifying boson samplers can still be a difficult .",
    "a more general paradigm is needed to approach certifying , or more generally learning , an underlying dynamical model .",
    "bayesian inference provides a near ideal framework to solve such problems .",
    "bayes theorem provides a convenient way to find the probability that a particular model for a system is true given an observed datum @xmath61 and a set of prior assumptions about the model @xmath62 .",
    "the prior assumptions about the model can be encoded as a probability distribution @xmath63 that can be interpreted as a probability that you subjectively assign to represent your belief that the true model is @xmath62 .",
    "constraints on the classes of models allowed can also be naturally included in this framework by changing the support of the prior distribution ( i.e. disallowed models are given zero a priori probability ) .",
    "the probability that model @xmath62 is correct , given the prior distribution and @xmath61 is    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is a normalizing constant .",
    "the resultant distribution is known as the posterior distribution , which then becomes the prior distribution for the next experiment .",
    "this procedure is called `` updating '' and @xmath66 is called the likelihood function .",
    "there is a strong connection in bayesian inference between learning and simulation .",
    "this link is made explicit through the likelihood function , @xmath66 , whose computation can be thought of as a simulation of @xmath62 .",
    "it further suggests that if the likelihood function can not be computed efficiently then updating your beliefs about the correct model for the system , given an observation of the system , is also not efficient .",
    "this can make bayesian inference intractable .",
    "let s return to the problem of testing models for quantum systems . in this context",
    ", bayesian inference can be extremely difficult to perform using conventional computers because the likelihood function is evaluated by simulating a quantum system , which we have argued can be exponentially expensive modulo reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions .",
    "this raises an interesting philosophical question : does computational complexity place fundamental limitations on our ability to understand systems in nature ?",
    "although this may be difficult to show in general ( owing to the plethora of ways that a quantum system can be probed and the data can be analyzed ) , it is possible to show that this conjecture holds in certain limiting cases :    there exist finite - dimensional models @xmath67 and @xmath68 for a quantum mechanical system and fixed observables @xmath69 such that models @xmath67 and @xmath68 can not be efficiently distinguished using bayesian inference based on outcomes of @xmath69 without causing the polynomial hierarchy to collapse and yet quantum computing can be used to efficiently distinguish these models using bayesian inference and the same @xmath69 .",
    "the proof of the first half of this claim is straight forward .",
    "let us consider @xmath67 and @xmath68 to be boson sampling experiments with different matrices @xmath70 and @xmath71 which are taken to be gaussian random matrices .",
    "let us further take @xmath69 to represent the measurement of the number of bosons in each of the modes .",
    "we saw that the likelihood of a particular outcome @xmath61 being observed involves calculating the permanents of @xmath72 and @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "efficient approximation of the permanent causes the polynomial hierarchy to collapse  @xcite and hence , modulo reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions , bayesian inference can not be used to distinguish between these models efficiently using @xmath69 .",
    "a quantum computer can not be expected to inexpensively compute the likelihood function directly because that entails computing a permanent : a task for which neither a fast quantum or conventional algorithm is known .",
    "so how is it that a quantum computer can provide an advantage ?",
    "the answer is that a quantum computer can be used to change the problem to one that is easily decidable . the key freedom that a quantum computer provides is the ability to perform basis transformations that , in effect , allow @xmath69 to be transformed into a different measurement operator whose outcomes provide clear evidence for some models over others .",
    "the presence of a quantum computer ( that is coupled to the experimental system ) therefore gives us the ability to solve the problem of model distinction in a completely different way .",
    "boson samplers can be efficiently simulated by a quantum computer . indeed ,",
    "a boson sampler is simply a linear optical quantum computer without the ability to adaptively control quantum gates based on prior measurements ( which is needed for universality ) .",
    "this means that a universal quantum computer trivially has all of the computational power of a boson sampler  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , closed system quantum dynamics are always be invertable ( unless the system is measured ) as we discussed in the context of quantum computing above .",
    "this means that we can scramble the initial state @xmath74 by running it through the boson sampler and attempt to approximately unscramble it using a quantum computer that simulates the inverse of the map that the boson sampler @xmath67 would perform .",
    "this inversion experiment is illustrated in ( b ) .",
    "the forward evolution under the experimental system and approximate inversion under the quantum computer of the initial quantum state vector is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the quantum transformation generated by @xmath67 , @xmath77 is the quantum transformation generated by @xmath68 and @xmath78 is an unknown transformation promised to be either @xmath76 or @xmath77 .",
    "if , for example , @xmath79 then this protocol performs : @xmath80 meaning that we will always observe as output the same state that was used as the input .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath81 then this process leads to @xmath82 in fact , with high probability over the matrices @xmath70 and @xmath71 this transformation will lead to a vector that is nearly orthogonal to @xmath74 if @xmath83 is large  @xcite , i.e. @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the conjugate transpose operation . in boson sampling experiments , @xmath74 is taken to be a boson number eigenstate meaning that a measurement of the number of bosons in each mode will yield the same value every time .",
    "this means that we can easily use the same @xmath69 to determine whether @xmath86 maps @xmath74 back to itself , which should happen with probability @xmath25 if @xmath79 and with low probability if @xmath81 .",
    "thus the decision problem can be solved efficiently using bayesian inference in concert with quantum computing , which justifies the above claim .",
    "quantum computation can therefore be used to convert seemingly intractable problems in modeling quantum systems into easily decidable ones . also , by using a quantum computer in place of an experimental device we can assign a computational complexity to performing experiments .",
    "this allows us to characterize facts about nature as `` easy '' or `` hard '' to learn based on how computationally expensive it would be to do so using an experimental system coupled to a quantum computer ; furthermore such insights are valuable _ even in absentia of a scalable quantum computer_.",
    "a quantum computer is more than just a computational device : it also is a universal toolbox that can emulate any other experimental system permitted by quantum theory . put simply , if a quantum computer were to be constructed that accepts input from external physical systems then experimental physics would become computer science . when seen in this light",
    ", computational complexity becomes vital to the foundations of physics because it gives insights into the limitations of our ability to model , and in turn understand , physical systems that are no less profound than those yielded by the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "it is assumed that the reader is familiar with quantum computing in the following . in particular ,   and",
    "are provided for the benefit of experts in quantum computation .",
    "the details of these results can , nonetheless , be safely ignored by the reader .",
    "this approach to learning physics using quantum computers is simply an elaboration on the strategy used above in   to  . as an example of this paradigm ( see  @xcite ) consider the following computational problem : assume that you are provided with an experimental quantum system that you can evolve for a specified evolution time @xmath87 .",

    "it can be used to estimate the likelihood using a number of queries that scales quadratically better with @xmath112 than statistical sampling and is successful at least @xmath120 of the time .",
    "the caveat is that we need to be able to reflect quantum state vectors about the space orthogonal to the marked state and also the initial state , which is efficient under the assumptions made above .",
