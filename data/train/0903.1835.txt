    "explaining the anomalous normal state properties of the so - called pseudogap regime of the underdoped cuprate superconductors is widely regarded as an essential step toward understanding the basic physics of these materials and unlocking the mechanism of their superconductivity@xcite .",
    "perhaps the most striking aspect of these is the universal , or scaling , behavior , first identified in measurements of their temperature - dependent uniform magnetic susceptibility@xcite , and since found in knight shift , transport , and entropy measurements . in the present article we present a detailed review of scaling behavior in the underdoped cuprates that extends previous analyses of its manifestations in both static and low frequency dynamic behavior as well as that seen in inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments .",
    "our review updates our earlier analysis@xcite and the results presented in norman _ _ et al.__@xcite , and complements the recent review of gap behavior presented in hfner _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite .",
    "we find that from zero hole doping until planar doping levels of @xmath5 are reached , the scaling behavior seen by probes of magnetic behavior reflects the presence of a spin liquid whose behavior maps onto the theoretical monte carlo calculations of the 2d heisenberg model of localized @xmath6 spins@xcite for most of its temperature domain .",
    "we use this to extract the doping dependence of the strength , @xmath1 of the spin liquid component and the effective interaction , @xmath2 between the remnant localized spins that compose it ; for @xmath7 , @xmath8 $ ] for both the 2 - 1 - 4 and 1 - 2 - 3 materials , while , to first approximation , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is their interaction at zero doping level .",
    "a careful analysis of the nmr experiments on both classes of materials makes it possible to identify a quantum critical point at a doping level , @xmath11 that represents a phase transition from short range to long range order in the spin liquid .",
    "it leads to dynamic @xmath12 scaling behavior for a wide range of doping levels that extends up to @xmath13 , the temperature at which the static susceptibility is maximum , corresponding to an antiferromagnetic correlation length of order unity .",
    "we find that the extent of this scaling behavior is different for the 2 - 1 - 4 and 1 - 2 - 3 materials : for the former it persists down to temperatures of order the superconducting transition temperature ; for the latter it cuts - off at @xmath14 , a temperature that it considerably greater than @xmath15 over most of the doping range .",
    "in addition to the spin liquid , whose properties dominate the low frequency magnetic response , bulk susceptibility measurements reveal the presence of a second component , a fermi liquid that makes a temperature independent , but doping dependent contribution to this quantity for temperatures greater than @xmath14 and doping levels of @xmath16 upwards .",
    "we present a simple interpretation of the two fluid description of these coupled liquids@xcite in terms of the incomplete hybridization of the cu @xmath17 and o @xmath18 bands ; the spin liquid corresponds to the unhybridized @xmath19 component , while the fermi liquid has a large fermi surface as a result of the @xmath20 hybridization .",
    "we derive the strength of the fermi liquid component , which goes as @xmath21 $ ] and so is proportional to @xmath22 , and show how the presence of the spin liquid is incompatible with the single band hubbard and zhang - rice approximations .",
    "we conclude that experiment has now provided the answer to the question of the physical mechanism responsible for the remarkable pseudogap behavior seen in the underdoped 1 - 2 - 3 materials ( @xmath23 , say ) . when the present analysis is combined with the recent arpes experiments@xcite and",
    "the stm measurements of the davis@xcite and yazdani@xcite groups , a simple physical picture emerges . in the `` normal state '' , for temperatures above @xmath24 , one has two quasi - independent components : a spin liquid of localized cu spins described by the 2d heisenberg model , whose strength and effective interaction become weaker as the doping level increases ; and a ( non - landau ) fermi liquid with a large fermi surface whose strength increases with doping and whose transport properties are determined primarily by its coupling to the spin liquid . at @xmath14",
    "the system makes a transition to a remarkable new quantum state of matter : a state that possesses a single d - wave like gap , with a maximum gap value of order @xmath25 , that only becomes superconducting at the typically much lower superconducting transition temperature , @xmath15 .",
    "the physical mechanism for the transition at @xmath14 ( and subsequently at @xmath15 ) in the 1 - 2 - 3 materials is magnetic because the scale of @xmath14 and the gap is set by the effective interaction between the localized spins in the spin liquid .",
    "matters are somewhat different for the 2 - 1 - 4 materials and we speculate as to why this is the case .    our review is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the literature on experimental measurements and corresponding analyses that indicate universal scaling behavior . in section 3 we introduce the phenomenological two - fluid model and use it to analyze existing magnetic and thermodynamic measurements on the bulk spin susceptibility , the entropy , and the spin fluctuation spectrum revealed in nuclear magnetic resonance and inelastic neutron scattering experiments . in section 4",
    "we present our conclusions concerning the interaction between the fermi liquid quasiparticles and the spin liquid excitations , discuss the similarities and differences between the 2 - 1 - 4 and 1 - 2 - 3 materials , and consider the constraints imposed by experiment on microscopic theories of their high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the observation of scaling in the cuprates is not new@xcite .",
    "not long after the discovery of the cuprate superconductors@xcite , universal behavior was identified in the magnetic properties of the 2 - 1 - 4 materials by johnston@xcite through an analysis of his measurements of the bulk spin susceptibility ; his analysis was later confirmed by nakano _ _ et al.__@xcite and oda _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "the johnston - nakano scaling analysis was subsequently extended by wuyts _ _ et al.__@xcite to the knight shift measurements of alloul _ _ et al.__@xcite in the 1 - 2 - 3 family ; more recently it has been shown to be applicable to the 1 - 2 - 4 and several other members of the 1 - 2 - 3 family by curro _ _ et al.__@xcite and the authors@xcite .",
    "a number of other experiments also indicate scaling and data collapse .",
    "these include electronic heat capacity measurements@xcite for which an analysis of the magnetic entropy found scaling behavior , quantum critical ( qc ) scaling behavior in nmr copper nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rates@xcite , limits on the @xmath26-linear behavior of resistivity@xcite , scaling of hall resistivity@xcite , @xmath27 scaling in inelastic neutron scattering@xcite , and finite - size scaling in the insulating cuprates@xcite .",
    "recently , scaling behavior has been discovered in the doping - dependence of arpes ( angle - resolved photoemission ) and stm experiments on the 2 - 2 - 1 - 2 members of the 1 - 2 - 3 family ; similar characteristic temperatures set the scale for the appearance of fermi arcs@xcite , and `` normal state '' gap behavior@xcite .    in this section",
    "we review the above experiments and find that the characteristic scaling temperature first identified by johnston , the temperature , @xmath28 , at which the temperature and doping dependent bulk magnetic susceptibility reaches its maximum value , provides the common thread that links these together .",
    "the scaling behavior of the temperature dependent bulk spin susceptibility , @xmath29 , was discovered empirically by johnston@xcite , who showed that an excellent collapse ( fig.[johnstonfig ] ) of his experimental data on five samples of la@xmath30sr@xmath31cuo@xmath32 , in which the doping level @xmath33 ranged from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , could be obtained if @xmath36 had the following scaling form : @xmath37 f(t / t^m(x ) ) , \\label{john1}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the doping level , @xmath38 is a doping - dependent , temperature independent term , @xmath39 is the maximum value of @xmath40 for a given doping level , and @xmath28 is the doping - dependent temperature at which @xmath29 is maximum .",
    "johnston concluded that the scaling parameter @xmath13 depends only on the hole doping level , @xmath22 , in the plane and that the scaling function @xmath41 is the same as that calculated for the 2d heisenberg model in its spin liquid regime ( i.e. at temperatures above the nel ordering temperature ) . in this model @xmath42 , where @xmath10 is the nearest neighbor exchange coupling between localized cu spins .",
    "the temperature independent @xmath38 was assumed to include @xmath22-independent core and van vleck contributions to @xmath40 , and an @xmath22-dependent fermi liquid contribution that grew somewhat slower than linearly with increased doping @xmath22 .",

    "reproduced with permission from @xcite , scaledwidth=75.0% ]    an alternative form of scaling for the bulk spin susceptibility was proposed by levin and quader@xcite .",
    "similar to the studies reviewed above , they suggested separation of the bulk spin susceptibility in two components , the temperature - independent fermi liquid component and the scaling component .",
    "however , in their model the scaling component originates from the contribution of a separate itinerant band .",
    "levin and quader@xcite took the 2d density of states in the following form : @xmath80 where the index @xmath81 corresponds to a large hole band , which produces the usual fermi liquid term in the bulk spin susceptibility .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath82 lies very close to the top of the second band @xmath83 and enters that band at @xmath84 .",
    "the contribution of the band @xmath83 to the bulk spin susceptibility becomes temperature - dependent due to thermally activated carriers and is a universal function @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is a fermi liquid parameter .",

    "the two - band model produced a reasonably successful data fit for the bulk susceptibility in tlsr@xmath58(lu@xmath88ca@xmath72)cu@xmath58o@xmath89 for both the underdoped and the overdoped regimes .    to summarize , the various independent measurements of the bulk susceptibility in the 2 - 1 - 4 and 1 - 2 - 3 materials can now be seen to be consistent with one another and with the picture first set forth by johnston : that in the underdoped regime , for dopings between @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , one has two independent contributions to the bulk spin susceptibility .",
    "one comes from a 2d heisenberg spin liquid with a doping - dependent effective interaction , @xmath93 ; the second represents a fermi liquid contribution whose strength increases as the doping level is increased .",
    "as we shall see , the fall - off of the rescaled spin susceptibility below the heisenberg spin liquid value at @xmath94 appears to be a universal property of the spin liquid in the cuprates .",
    "the knight shift seen in nmr experiments is a measurement of the bulk spin susceptibility at a particular nuclear site@xcite , so that measurements of the knight shift for different nuclei serve to supplement direct measurements of the bulk susceptibility .",
    "most of the early analysis of the nmr data used a single - component mila - rice - shastry ( mrs ) description@xcite for which the justification was the observation by alloul _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite and takigawa _ _ et al.__@xcite that the @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 knight shifts in yba@xmath58cu@xmath98o@xmath99 and yba@xmath58cu@xmath98o@xmath100 have the same anomalous temperature dependence ( fig.[mptfig ] ) .",

    "most earlier knight shift experiments@xcite confirmed this one - component zhang - rice@xcite singlet picture , which is basically correct for the parent insulator .",

    "the @xmath97 knight shift data from alloul _ _ et al.__@xcite for different doping levels in the 1 - 2 - 3 family has been scaled to a single curve with very good data collapse by wuyts _ _ et al.__@xcite , although no comparison to the 2d heisenberg model or the nakano _ _ et al.__@xcite bulk spin susceptibility scaling curve was provided .",
    "recently curro _ _ et al.__@xcite and the authors@xcite have shown that the two are consistent ; as may be seen in fig.[currofig ] , the nmr knight shift follows very well the johnston - nakano bulk susceptibility scaling form and the heisenberg model for the 1 - 2 - 4 member of the 1 - 2 - 3 family .",
    "spin liquid scaling behavior determined by @xmath28 has thus been shown to be universal in the cuprates .",
    "what then is the direct experimental evidence from knight shift measurements for the presence of two distinct components ?",
    "one material for which a contradiction with the simple one component model was found is yba@xmath58cu@xmath59o@xmath62 , where a more precise measurement@xcite of the copper knight shift data in magnetic fields parallel to the c - axis , @xmath104 , found that it displays a rather unusual temperature dependence , one that is different from that seen for the bulk spin liquid susceptibility .",
    "a second example comes from quite recent measurements by haase _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite of the planar and apical oxygen knight shifts for la@xmath105sr@xmath106cuo@xmath59 . as we discuss in a later section ,",
    "these indicate that while the temperature - dependent part of the knight shift on different nuclei is indeed the same , there is a temperature - independent part of the knight shift above the superconducting temperature , @xmath15 , that is different for the planar copper and the planar and apical oxygen nuclei .",
    "the key signature of this effect , the deviation of various knight shifts from the same temperature dependence at temperatures below @xmath15 , is clearly visible in fig.[mptfig ] .",
    "these contradictions suggest that the original mrs hyperfine hamiltonian has to be modified to include these new effects , and that the one - component spin dynamics and the zhang - rice singlet picture@xcite fails at moderate doping levels@xcite , a topic to which we return in section 3 .      in the mrs hamiltonian that is described in detail in the following section , wave vector dependent form factors arise from the presence of a transferred hyperfine interaction between the cu spins and the probe nucleus . for probe nuclei other than copper ,",
    "these vanish at the commensurate wave vector @xmath107 , so that , for example , an in - plane oxygen nucleus will feel little of a spin response that is peaked at the commensurate wave vector .",
    "( that this should be the case is obvious if one recalls that such oxygen are located midway between copper nuclei , and for an antiferromagnetic array of copper spins , the nearest neighbor spins would cancel one another out in their influence on the oxygen site . ) the striking difference of the temperature dependence and magnitude of the spin - lattice relaxation on the @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 nuclei led millis , monien , and pines ( mmp)@xcite to the conclusion that a localized or nearly localized spin component of the dynamic magnetic response function must be strongly peaked at the commensurate wave vector , as might be expected if one were close to an antiferromagnetic instability .",
    "indeed , closer study shows that even a slight deviation from commensurability within the mmp approach based on the mrs one - component model will have a significant impact on oxygen relaxation rates that is not seen experimentally@xcite .",
    "thus , an incommensurate peak structure for @xmath108 , such as has been inferred from inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments@xcite on the 2 - 1 - 4 materials , is inconsistent with this approach .",
    "one way to get around this difficulty is to introduce additional transferred hyperfine interactions@xcite ; a second way , proposed by slichter@xcite , is to note that unlike nmr , ins is a global probe of spin excitations , so that a suitable domain structure ( regions of commensurate near - antiferromagnetic behavior , separated by domain walls ) would give rise to the apparent incommensuration inferred from the ins experiments .",
    "we adopt this explanation in what follows .    the spin fluctuation response function proposed by mmp",
    "was that appropriate to any spin liquid near a commensurate antiferromagnetic instability : @xmath109 where the peak susceptibility takes the form , @xmath110 with @xmath81 as the magnetic correlation length , and @xmath111 as a temperature - independent constant .",
    "the copper nmr @xmath112 and @xmath113 relaxation rates provide a direct measure of the strength and character of the spin liquid response function , measuring as they do the momentum - integrated imaginary and real part of the spin response function , @xmath114@xcite .",
    "one finds : @xmath115    imai _ _ et al.__@xcite in an early scaling analyses ( fig .",
    "[ imaifig ] ) of the copper relaxation rates for the 2 - 1 - 4 family demonstrated experimentally the existence of a universal high temperature limit for @xmath112 that is temperature- and doping- independent : @xmath116 which according to eq.([t1mmp ] ) means that at high temperatures the spin fluctuation energy , @xmath117 must be proportional to t. this universal high - temperature behavior of @xmath112 was explained in terms of the qc ( quantum critical)@xcite behavior seen in the sigma - model@xcite that , strictly speaking , is only applicable to the parent insulating compound .",
    "indeed the empirical finding of a temperature- and doping independent @xmath112 in the 2 - 1 - 4 family of materials extends to temperatures much higher than those at which such a theoretical explanation would apply .     measured by nqr for la@xmath71sr@xmath72cuo@xmath59 ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) .",

    "moreover , in agreement with the early models of spin - fluctuation - induced superconductivity@xcite the resulting energy gaps will be d - wave .",
    "\\(iv ) the penetration - depth measurements of the doping - dependence of the of the superconducting condensate tell us that where present in the underdoped materials , the spin liquid does not participate in their superconductivity .",

    "\\(vii ) these last conclusions concerning the relative strengths of the coupling of hot quasiparticles to the spin liquid and their spin - fluctuation - induced quasiparticle interaction in the 1 - 2 - 3 and 2 - 1 - 4 materials provide a simple physical explanation of some of the major differences between their physical behavior of the two classes of materials .",

    "\\(viii ) there are many indications that `` stripy '' behavior is more prevalent in the 2 - 1 - 4 materials ; this may be due to the fact that the fluctuating domains become well established only when fairly strong af correlations are present .",

    "\\(ix ) experiment indicates that at low temperatures @xmath530 , charge fluctuations , domains , and tendencies toward phase separation all play an important role , although the two - component nature is present in the underdoped regime at all temperatures , and is therefore intrinsic .",
    "\\(x ) our two - fluid model provides a natural way to develop a phenomenological description of stripe formation at low frequencies , since all that is required is to let @xmath1 vary periodically in space and time .",
    "we conclude this section with a brief discussion of some necessary elements of a microscopic description of the spin and fermi liquids .",
    "we note first that for the spin liquid , the af critical point at @xmath531 is responsible for the observed @xmath532 qc behavior .",
    "the spin liquid component at temperatures @xmath533 is well described to first approximation by the standard bosonic @xmath534 hertz - millis theory of quantum critical behavior@xcite . for @xmath535",
    "one is outside the critical region , in the vicinity of weak - coupling gaussian fixed point , where fluctuation corrections are not important .",
    "the standard damping due to its interaction with fermions gives rise to the @xmath536 mean field ornstein - zernike / mmp form . in the critical region",
    "@xmath534 theory becomes equivalent to the qnl@xmath503 model@xcite ( the two theories differ by an irrelevant operator ) .",
    "however , at low correlation lengths the irrelevant operator of the @xmath534 theory plays a crucial role , inducing a crossover to the mean field gaussian regime@xcite with @xmath537 for @xmath538 version@xcite .",
    "such @xmath532 to @xmath536 mean field crossover can not be obtained in the quantum non - linear @xmath503-model with fermionic damping@xcite .",
    "there appear to be two kinds of departures from the simple heisenberg description .",
    "the first concerns the static bulk susceptibility that falls below the currently calculated values for the heisenberg model for @xmath539 . because this fall - off is essentially the same in both the 2 - 1 - 4 and 1 - 2 - 3 materials , it is likely not brought about by spin - fermion coupling , since that coupling is quite different for the two materials .",
    "it could represent an inadequacy in the calculations of the expected behavior of the heisenberg model at these low temperatures .",
    "the second concerns the opening up of a gap in the low frequency spin liquid excitation spectrum at @xmath193 that is seen as a minimum in @xmath540 at @xmath541 in the nmr experiments on the 1 - 2 - 4 material and at @xmath542 in the yba@xmath58cu@xmath98o@xmath100 material .",
    "it is plausible to conclude that it reflects a reduction in quasiparticle damping brought about by the onset of the hot quasi - particle gapped behavior at @xmath14 .",
    "however , it would then seem that the transition to this new quantum state is not universal , i.e. does not always occur at a fixed fraction of @xmath13 . indeed these nmr - determined onset temperatures , @xmath14 , scale , to first approximation with @xmath15 ; thus for the 1 - 2 - 4 material one has @xmath543 , while for yba@xmath58cu@xmath980@xmath100 one finds @xmath544 .",
    "based on these estimates , and those obtained from the arpes and stm experiments on 2212 members of the 1 - 2 - 3 family , our candidate phase diagram for the 1 - 2 - 3 materials is given in fig .",
    "[ phased]b .",
    "it differs from the corresponding diagram for the 214 materials in the presence of a `` high temperature '' transition at @xmath14 to the gapped quantum state .    in considering microscopic models for the evolution of fermi liquid behavior with doping , we begin by recalling that high - t@xmath146 superconductors are doped charge - transfer insulators@xcite .",
    "thus , an adequate starting point for a description of the cuo@xmath58 planes follows from their chemistry , and is the three - band hubbard model composed of 3 d@xmath545 orbitals on the cu site and 2 p@xmath546 orbitals on the o sites@xcite .",
    "the two key parameters of the three - band hubbard model are are the charge - transfer energy @xmath547 , and the copper on - site coulomb repulsion , @xmath548 . in the limit of strong p - d hybridization and very strong on - site cu coulomb interaction ,",
    "the model gives rise to 5 different bands : an antibonding band , further split into upper hubbard band ( cu @xmath549 configuration ) , and lower hubbard band ( cu @xmath550 configuration ) by the coulomb interaction , a bonding band , further split into zhang - rice ( zr)@xcite singlet and triplet bands , and the non - bonding oxygen band .    following anderson@xcite , most theoretical studies have considered a simpler one band hubbard model , which has fewer parameters and assumes that the low - energy physics of the electronic states in the vicinity of the charge - transfer gap is described well by taking a relevant low - energy subset of this complex band structure , the zr singlet band and the upper hubbard band , separated by @xmath551 of the order of the charge - transfer gap .",
    "numerical studies of the three - band hubbard model@xcite support such reduction .",
    "the two low - energy bands of the effective single - band hubbard model are strongly correlated hybridized copper - oxygen bands , with the upper hubbard band having mostly oxygen character@xcite .",
    "however , on the basis of numerical lda calculations , it has been suggested that a single - band tight binding model may not provide a sufficiently good qualitative description of the many bands involved@xcite .",
    "moreover , we have seen that @xmath357 contains the spin liquid component localized on the copper sites , while @xmath361 and @xmath358 pick up contributions from the holes on the oxygen sites .",
    "the difference in relevant form factors could potentially explain many anomalies observed for nmr relaxation rates@xcite and inelastic neutron scattering experiments , as we have discussed in the previous section .    the analogy with two - fluid model for heavy fermions@xcite can be better understood from an alternative approach to three - band hubbard model@xcite , that is perturbative in p - d hybridization , @xmath552 . in case of exactly one hole per cu and strong hubbard coulomb on - site repulsion @xmath548 , the low - energy hamiltonian for the three - band hubbard model reduces to the heisenberg spin hamiltonian with exchange coupling @xmath553 since the charge excitations have a gap @xmath554 .",
    "numerical calculations for the three - band hubbard model@xcite extract the value @xmath555 , consistent with that observed in neutron scattering experiments .",
    "the oxygen holes and the nearest @xmath6 spin interact via a strong kondo exchange interaction , which can be obtained in perturbation theory in @xmath556 , @xmath557 the perturbative analysis of the three - band hubbard model reduces it to the spin - fermion model via the schrieffer - wolff@xcite transformation , @xmath558 here the index @xmath374(@xmath377 ) runs over cu ( o ) sites , @xmath559 , @xmath560 are creation and annihilation operators , respectively , for holes in oxygen p bands .",
    "the kondo interaction is , in general , non - local@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian eq.([sfmodel ] ) is the kondo - heisenberg model , known for the periodic anderson model in many physical systems , including magnetic semiconductors@xcite , heavy fermions ( the kondo lattice model)@xcite , and high - t@xmath146 superconductors@xcite .",
    "the heavy fermion materials and high-@xmath15 materials correspond to different limits of the model eq.([sfmodel ] ) . in heavy fermion superconductors",
    "the kondo interaction @xmath561 is initially comparatively small , and gets renormalized by the conduction band as the temperature is lowered , leading to the onset of coherence at @xmath14 , and the two - fluid heavy fermion behavior@xcite with a temperature - dependent fraction of spin liquid ( spin impurity contribution ) .",
    "the high-@xmath15 superconductors , on the other hand , are in the strong - coupling zhang - rice@xcite limit of the same microscopic model , eq.([sfmodel ] ) .",
    "the kondo interaction is very large , @xmath562 , which leads to a formation and propagation of the `` zhang - rice singlets '' , reducing the microscopic hamiltonian to an effective one - band @xmath563 model@xcite .",
    "the projection operators of the zhang - rice singlet@xcite automatically imply that @xmath564 .",
    "thus , as suggested by mmp@xcite , different nuclei then feel the presence of a single temperature - dependent spin component residing on copper , or @xmath357 . the zhang - rice singlet picture ( and the t - j model ) , however , inevitably gets violated at higher doping , as a single large fermi surface develops , that corresponds to antibonding p - d hybridized band . a linear decrease of effective @xmath49 with increased doping @xmath22 is `` high - energy physics '' , as is evident from , for example , an adiabatic treatment of the t - j model@xcite .",
    "thus , the fraction of spin liquid@xcite observed in `` low energy '' experiments on the cuprate superconductors will be temperature - independent . in heavy fermion metals",
    "it is the mixed @xmath565 contribution , @xmath566 , that gives rise to the heavy fermi liquid contribution@xcite . in high - temperature superconductors , on the other hand , one normally uses the zhang - rice singlet band and the upper hubbard band of the three - band hubbard model as lower and upper hubbard bands of the effective single - band hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "using the analogy the heavy fermion two - fluid model@xcite and the two - fluid model for high - t@xmath146 superconductors , the fermi liquid contribution in the cuprates should arise from @xmath361 and @xmath358 parts of the bulk spin susceptibility , which , strictly speaking , indicates a violation of the zhang - rice singlet picture at high doping , given by eqs .",
    "( [ ddpart ] ) , ( [ pdpart ] ) .",
    "since the effective mass of carriers is not heavy in high-@xmath15 superconductors , one would expect both @xmath358 and @xmath361 contributions to be present .",
    "this result contrasts strongly with the pure zhang - rice@xcite limit in which all contributions arise from @xmath357@xcite .",
    "the key answer to this very important question is held by the new knight shift experiments@xcite , since then knight shifts on different nuclei should see a different temperature dependence , at least below the superconducting temperature , @xmath15 .",
    "our review of scaling behavior in the cuprate superconductors makes evident the critical role that the localization of cu spins by strong on - site repulsive coulomb interactions plays in determining the properties of the magnetically underdoped superconductors , those whose planar hole concentrations are @xmath567 .",
    "while there is much more in the way of details that experiment can and will provide , from additional c - axis nmr experiments on 1 - 2 - 3 materials that enable one to follow the emergence of a distinct fermi liquid contribution , to arpes , nmr , and stm experiments that fill in the details of the emergence of the gapped hot quasiparticle state at @xmath14 , we believe that the overall low - energy physical picture of a normal state described by two fluids whose interaction leads to its remarkable properties has now been firmly established .",
    "it is equally clear that much much more remains to be done , beginning with the development of a better microscopic foundation for the physical picture that experiment has `` forced '' upon us , and an improved treatment of transport processes based upon it .",
    "we mention here but a few of the many remaining challenges and mysteries that surround these fascinating materials :    \\(i ) there are striking similarities in the doping dependence of @xmath15 in the 1 - 2 - 3 and 2 - 1 - 4 materials despite the difference in their spin - fermion couplings and the magnitudes of their respective transition temperatures .",
    "does this tell us that these differences are primarily in how the hot quasiparticles couple to spin fluctuations and that the spin - fermion couplings for the cold quasiparticles that bring on their superconductivity can somehow be scaled for these two classes of materials ?",
    "\\(ii ) although the spin liquid ceases to be a significant `` player '' for doping levels greater than , say , @xmath0 , the existence of a smooth cross - over in most physical properties of the normal state , including the superconducting transition , as one goes from magnetically underdoped to magnetically overdoped materials , suggests that its disappearance must be accompanied by the emergence of sufficiently strong antiferromagnetic correlations in the fermi liquid that enable its properties to merge smoothly with those induced by the spin liquid .",
    "can these be detected experimentally and understood microscopically ?",
    "might the disappearance of the spin liquid be accompanied by the emergence of a single - band hubbard model that is valid for the overdoped materials ?",
    "\\(iii ) do the gapped hot quasiparticles found below @xmath14 in the 1 - 2 - 3 materials become effectively localized and so become part of the spin liquid ?",
    "is there any way to make their gapping more productive , in terms of their becoming part of the superconducting condensate , thereby opening the way to a superconducting transition at the considerably higher transition temperature , @xmath14 ?",
    "\\(iv ) can the lessons learned from the cuprates be transferred to other materials , and so lead over time to the discovery of still higher temperature superconductors ?",
