    "dynamical mass generation in gauge theories has long been studied using the gap equation ; i.e. , the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) for the dressed fermion propagator @xcite .",
    "the gap equation is nonlinear in the dressed - fermion mass - function , @xmath0 ; and it was found early @xcite that a simple ( rainbow ) truncation of this equation possess a countable infinity of solutions , with each one characterized by : its magnitude and sign at @xmath1 ; and the number of zeros it possesses on @xmath2 .",
    "the existence of this tower of solutions to the truncated equation almost immediately fostered speculation about their possible physical consequences @xcite .",
    "the non - uniqueness of solutions to the rainbow gap equation was later rediscovered independently , with the explicit identification of three distinct solutions that bifurcate from the trivial @xmath3 solution as the coupling strength is increased @xcite ; and then again about a decade later @xcite .",
    "more recently , solutions of the gap equation with repeated zero crossings were also found using a simple generalization of the rainbow truncation @xcite ; and in ref.@xcite their existence was firmly established using a procedure that enables one to obtain all solutions of the gap equation in the presence of a variety of external control parameters .    in considering all these contributions one",
    "is naturally led to wonder about the general conditions under which a gauge theory s gap equation will admit solutions with zeros in addition to that single positive - definite solution which is conventionally associated with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) .",
    "herein we provide a partial answer , using quantum electrodynamics in three dimensions ( qed3 ) as an illustrative tool .",
    "our choice of theory is motivated first by a number of properties that qed3 shares with quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "for example , quenched qed3 possesses a nonzero string tension @xcite ; and this feature persists in the unquenched theory if massive fermions circulate in the photon vacuum polarization @xcite .",
    "in addition , since qed3 is super - renormalizable , it has a well - defined chiral limit and therefore admits the possibility and study of dcsb .",
    "dcsb in qcd underlies the success of chiral effective field theory , explains the origin of constituent - quark masses @xcite and hence the vast bulk of visible mass in the universe @xcite , and quite probably shares its origin with light - quark confinement @xcite .",
    "there is also an applied interest and relevance because qed3 is used in condensed matter physics as an effective field theory for high - temperature superconductors @xcite and graphene @xcite .",
    "our partial answer to the problem of anticipating the appearance of solutions to the gap equation with one or more damped oscillations is based upon the following observation @xcite : in rainbow truncation the dressed - fermion mass function satisfies a nonlinear hammerstein integral equation @xcite .",
    "the conditions under which such equations admit oscillatory solutions were long ago elucidated in the mathematics literature @xcite .",
    "we find that if the dressed - fermion - photon vertex produces a gap equation kernel that satisfies those conditions , then solutions with zeros are readily found numerically .",
    "this is not the case when the vertex produces a kernel that violates the conditions .",
    "our material is organized as follows . in sec.[theory ] we recapitulate briefly upon the theory of nonlinear hammerstein integral equations , listing the criteria which guarantee the existence of oscillatory solutions for the mass function and providing a simple example .",
    "we analyze qed3 from the perspective of hammerstein integral equations in sec.[qed3-gap ] ; and in sec.[gauge ] we explain that if oscillatory solutions exist in landau gauge , then they are present in all covariant gauges .",

    ". it was subsequently demonstrated @xcite that eq.([eq : hammer ] ) possesses infinitely many solutions , each distinguished by its number of zeros , for any prescribed value of @xmath33 thus , as with differential equations , at least one large class of integral equations possesses an enumerable infinity of solutions with damped oscillations .",
    "a simple , physical realization of the hammerstein integral equation may arise in connection with graphene , a one - atom - thick layer of graphite , wherein quasiparticle excitations are described by the massless dirac equation in @xmath34-dimensions .",

    "it is the gauge in which any sound _ ansatz _ for the fermion - photon vertex can most legitimately be described as providing a pointwise accurate approximation .",

    "ansatz_. the sensible implementation of this procedure guarantees gauge covariance and hence obviates any question about the gauge dependence of gauge invariant quantities .",

    "the number of independent eigenfunctions equals the number of quadrature points and hence , in the continuum limit , there is a countable infinity of solutions , each distinguished by its magnitude and number of zeros .",
    "armed with the knowledge accumulated above , we are ready to find all solutions of the original problem ; i.e. , eq .. in the chiral limit , besides the trivial @xmath3 solution that is admitted in perturbation theory , and the well - known positive - definite dcsb solution , we find the now expected series of solutions , each one of which may be labeled uniquely by the number of zeros it possesses and its sign at @xmath1 .",

    "such difficulties are overcome if a more sophisticated numerical algorithm is used ; e.g. , the homotopy continuation method described and employed in ref.@xcite .",

    "supports only the positive - definite zero - free solution for @xmath119 .",

    ", the explanation might be that they are inadequate to the task when these more complicated and realistic _",

    ", the gap equations are typically elements in the more general class of nonlinear urysonh integral equations @xcite .",
    "little is known about the nature of solutions to such equations .",
    "moreover , the full theory must be even more complicated because , in addition to the explicit dependence on @xmath127 expressed in _ anstze _",
    ", the true dressed vertex will possess an implicit dependence on the dressed - propagator whose nature is impossible to guess .",
    "these observations indicate that the known conditions under which the gap equation can possess multiple solutions are quite strict and , moreover , that they are usually not met when the dressed - fermion  gauge - boson vertex possesses what might justifiably be called a _ realistic _",
    "form .    as a counterpoint ,",
    "we have considered a combination of the qcd - based interactions in refs.@xcite and the complete ball - chiu _ ansatz_. in these cases the homotopy continuation algorithm reveals that there are no solutions with zeros unless the interaction strength is inflated to an unrealistically large value ; i.e. , more than five - times the strength required to explain contemporary experiment @xcite . owing to the capacities of the homotopy continuation algorithm , which are detailed elsewhere @xcite , one can safely conclude that no solution has been overlooked .    applying this experience to qed3",
    ", one can reasonably argue that a qed3 gap equation with the ball - chiu vertex possesses no solutions with a zero .",
    "this is because the mass - scale is set by the coupling strength , which therefore does not provide a tool for inflating the interaction strength relative to other scales ; and , furthermore , fermion loops provide screening , so that unquenching acts to further suppress the interaction strength .",
    "the fermion propagator is gauge covariant but not gauge invariant ; and in the preceding discussion we have focused on landau gauge . as we noted above ,",
    "this is because landau gauge occupies a special place in gauge theories .",
    "in addition to other important properties , such as being a fixed point of the renormalization group and the gauge in which any sensitivity to model - dependent differences between _ anstze _ for the fermion - photon vertex are least noticeable , it is also the sole covariant gauge in which the infrared behavior of the fermion propagator is not modified by a non - dynamical gauge - dependent exponential factor whose presence can obscure truly observable features of the theory @xcite .",
    "moreover , as we now explain , by capitalizing on the landau - khalatnikov - fradkin ( lkf ) transformations @xcite , a mechanical realization of the gauge covariance property , one may focus on landau gauge in abelian theories without loss of generality . in configuration space",
    ", the fermion propagator in any covariant gauge , @xmath128 , is obtained from its landau gauge ( @xmath129 ) form via the following operation : @xmath130 for @xmath131 , one may readily translate this transformation into momentum space @xcite :    [ lkfts ] @xmath132 , \\label{gistv}\\\\ \\sigma_s(p;\\xi ) & = & \\frac{\\varsigma}{\\pi p}\\int_0^\\infty \\!\\ !",

    "we illustrate the result for a two - zero solution in fig.[fig : lkf2 ] .",
    "it is true in general that the wavefunction renormalization , @xmath136 , remains zero - free in all covariant gauges and the lkf transformation does not shift the location of any zero in @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear , therefore , that whatever is the qualitative character of the gap equation s landau gauge solution , it is the same in all covariant gauges .",
    "namely , if there are multiple solutions for the mass function in landau gauge , each with a different number of zeros , then these solutions exist in all gauges .",
    "notably , however , for @xmath131 their magnitude is rapidly damped ( see eq . and lower panel of fig.[fig : lkf2 ] ) , an effect that will make them difficult to locate numerically if one chooses to solve the gap equation directly in a different gauge .",
    "of course , the gap equation solution obtained directly in a different gauge would only be meaningful if the gap equation were built with the lkf transform of the original landau - gauge vertex _",
    "[ final ] using quenched qed3 as an example , we explored conditions under which a gauge theory s chiral - limit gap equation can exhibit multiple solutions .",
    "we argued that so long as the landau - gauge gap equation can be rewritten as an hammerstein integral equation of the first kind , it will possess a countable infinity of simultaneous solutions .",
    "those solutions will be distinguished , one from another , by the number of zeros they possess and their magnitude and sign at the origin .",
    "whilst a large class of truncations of gauge theory gap equations possess the hammerstein property , a far larger class does not .",
    "membership of the hammerstein class is not usually determined by the form of the dressed - gauge - boson propagator but , instead , it is decided by the structure of the dressed - fermion  gauge - boson vertex .",
    "we can not now say anything definite in general about the existence of multiple solutions for members of the non - hammerstein class of gap equations .",
    "however , by analyzing examples from that class , we were led to conjecture that there is at least a large subclass that do not possess solutions with zeros .",
    "indeed , it appears to us that the general conditions under which a gauge theory s chiral - limit gap equation can possess solutions with zeros are quite restrictive ; and it is therefore probable that when a realistic _ ansatz _ is employed for the dressed vertex , the only dynamical chiral symmetry breaking solutions that exist are those with no zeros .",
    "although we have only considered qed3 explicitly , the mathematical framework we have described applies more broadly .",
    "we therefore judge that our results are equally relevant to existing realistic models for the gap equation in qcd .",

    "<S> theories that support dynamical generation of a fermion mass gap are of widespread interest . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon is often studied via the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) for the fermion self energy ; i.e. , the gap equation . </S>",
    "<S> when the rainbow truncation of that equation supports dynamical mass generation , it typically also possesses a countable infinity of simultaneous solutions for the dressed - fermion mass function , solutions which may be ordered by the number of zeros they exhibit . </S>",
    "<S> these features can be understood via the theory of nonlinear hammerstein integral equations . using qed3 as an example </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate the existence of a large class of gap equation truncations that possess solutions with damped oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that there is a larger class , quite probably including the exact theory , which does not . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the dressed - fermion  gauge - boson vertex is an important factor in deciding the issue . </S>"
