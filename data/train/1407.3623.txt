    "the idea presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the einstein model was combined with the elastic one , has been extended here for the debye approximation . what is more , the electronic subsystem with its kinetic and exchange energy has been taken into account .",
    "the electronic energy has been considered in better approximation than in previous works @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the ground state ( fermi ) energy , as well as the exchange energy , both of them being volume dependent , can contribute to the electronic pressure .",
    "the regions of low and high temperatures are described by different eos , however , the whole temperature range @xmath189 has been covered by these equations .",
    "contrary to birch - murnaghan equation of state , which presents only an isothermal description @xcite , in our eos all of the variables ( @xmath190 and @xmath2 ) are treated equivalently .",
    "the numerical results have been obtained for gold crystal showing satisfactory agreement with the experimental data , as well as with some dft calculations .",
    "the difference between our results and the experimental data does not exceed @xmath185 for the best fit of theoretical parameters .",
    "+ the greatest difference between the numerical results and experiment turns out to be near the melting point . a possible source of such inaccuracy",
    "is the debye approximation .",
    "this approximation has been used for the sake of simplicity , however , it is rather coarse for the real systems at high temperatures .",
    "another reason is that our starting point for the series expansion of elastic energy with respect to @xmath11 is ( @xmath5 , @xmath4 ) .",
    "thus , our theory is most applicable around the equilibrium point ( @xmath191 and @xmath120 ) . for the case of gold",
    "it is quite far from the melting point .",
    "for instance , in high - pressure equation of state ( birch - murnaghan ) @xmath192 k and @xmath193 bar has been assumed as a reference temperature and pressure point . in our case , expanding the range of pressures up to some extreme values would require higher order terms vs. @xmath11 and new fitting parameters in the elastic potential to be taken into account , as well as other necessary improvements on the presented approach .",
    "for instance , the assumption that the elastic coefficients @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , etc . , are constants in the whole temperature and pressure region is only an approximation .",
    "it has been shown that the elastic coefficients of gold are , to some extent , pressure @xcite and temperature @xcite dependent . for the above reasons , the application of the method in its present form for the range of extreme pressures would be , in our opinion , rather limited in practice .",
    "+ similarly to other models leading to eos , in our calculations we have used only a single variable @xmath11 for description of the volume elastic deformation . however , the approach can be generalized for anisotropic deformations ( also including anisotropic external pressures ) .",
    "it should also be mentioned that our considerations are limited to the quasistatic processes and the shock - wave experiments can not be described within this model .",
    "+ in this paper the numerical calculations have been performed for the case of gold only .",
    "the analysis for another metal can be done analogously , whereas the numerical calculations of all thermodynamic properties should be performed simultaneously from one set of fitting parameters . among these parameters",
    "there are characteristics of elastic potential ( @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , etc . ) , as well as other parameters ( @xmath23 , @xmath98 ) which form an unique set for a given metal .",
    "the best fitting of all curves to the experimental data means in practice multiple and time - consuming calculations .",
    "however , the numerical calculations and analysis of the properties for other metals is beyond the scope of present paper , which is mainly devoted to the detailed presentation of theoretical model .",
    "+ in spite of the features mentioned above , in our opinion , the presented model can be useful for thermodynamic description of metallic systems .",
    "its advantage follows from the fact that all thermodynamic properties can be found on the basis of one single expression : the gibbs energy .",
    "hence , the self - consistency of the theory is preserved and all thermodynamic relationships ( like grneisen equation ) are exactly fulfilled .",
    "as mentioned above , the model can be further improved when the volume deformation @xmath11 is treated as anisotropic quantity . on the other hand ,",
    "the vibrational energy can be taken more accurately than in the debye approximation , for instance , by better modelling of the phononic dispersion relations and density of states .",
    "also , the electronic energy calculations would benefit from a more realistic model of band structure . for further improvement of the model ,",
    "electron - phonon interaction might also be taken into account .",
    "of course , such improvements will make the model more accurate , but , at the same time , more complicated for the practical use . +"
