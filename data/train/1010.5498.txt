    "after the formation of galaxies in the universe , at any given time in the history of the universe , only a small fraction of galaxies show agn activity . it is known that almost all galaxies with a spheroidal component contain a smbh , and that the bh mass is closely related to the mass or the velocity dispersion of the spheroidal component ( e.g. , @xcite for review ) .",
    "this means that most galaxies have likely had one or more brief agn periods , during which the central smbh grows in such a way that the growth of the smbh and the formation of the spheroidal component are tightly related .",
    "the question of when and under what physical conditions the accretion takes place is important in understanding not only the origin and evolution of smbhs but also the origin and evolution of galaxies .",

    "in performing the hod modeling , we consider that galaxies and agns are associated with dmhs , the mass function of which ( per comoving volume per @xmath67 ) is denoted by @xmath68 , where @xmath1 is the dark matter halo mass .",

    "the usual assumption is that the radial distribution of the involved objects that are not at the center of the halo  objects that are satellites  follows the mass profile of the dmh itself , i.e. , there is no internal biasing .",
    "following @xcite , whose results will be used later in this work , we use the @xcite ( nfw ) profile for the dmh density distribution , which is still a popular choice for representing dmh profiles , although other parametrizations exist in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the hod model is calculated using a set of software we have developed , based partially on a code developed by j. peacock for the use in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our software includes a number of improvements over their code , most notably by including the application of the hod modeling to a ccf .",
    "we note , however , that in our analysis we do not include some recent improvements in modeling the 2-halo term @xcite .",
    "the neglected factors include the convolution of the dmh profile to the 2-halo term and the scale - dependent bias .",
    "in addition , if a pair of objects are closer than the sum of the virial radii of their parent halos , the pair should not be counted in the 2-halo term ; this effect is neglected .",
    "these improvements have enabled those authors to make accurate modelings of , e.g. , the acf of sdss galaxies , where the correlation functions can be measured to a few percent level at @xmath91 mpc . however , as agns have a much smaller number density , the errors on our ccf measurements are @xmath92% ( paper i ) at this @xmath54 , where these improvements are important .",
    "therefore the effects of these recent improvements by other authors are estimated to be within the 1@xmath93 measurement errors of the ccf .      in this subsection",
    ", we explain the application of the hod modeling to the ccf between agns and lrgs ( or more generally , between any two different populations ) . using the hod of the lrgs as a template , which has been accurately constrained by z09 using the lrg acf measured by @xcite",
    ", we constrain the hod of the agns by fitting to the agn - lrg ccf .",
    "a similar approach has been made by z09 to model the ccf between lrgs and @xmath18 galaxies , where they assumed that the lrgs are at the halo centers and the @xmath18 galaxies are satellites in the 1-halo term calculation . since lrgs occupy the centers of almost all massive dmhs ( @xmath94 $ ] , z09 ) , this is a good approximation for their lrg-@xmath18 galaxy ccf as well as for our agn - lrg ccf .",
    "however , for completeness , we develop a formulation of the hod modeling that includes more general cases . hereafter , the quantities for agns are represented by a subscript `` a '' , lrgs by `` g '' ( representing _ galaxies _ ) , and ccf between the two by `` ag '' .",

    ", the two halo term can be expressed as follows .",
    "let the linear bias parameters of the lrgs and agns be @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively : @xmath103 then the two halo term of the power spectrum corresponding to the ccf ( cross power spectrum ) can be expressed by @xmath104    the 1-halo term is composed of three terms : @xmath105\\ , dm_{\\rm h } , \\label{eq : pag1h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] provided that no object is in common between the agn and lrg samples ( which is the case in our ccf ) . in this case , the relation @xmath106 holds , where the subscripts x and y represent any combination of the subscripts s and c , except for the case both are c s .",
    "this relation is exact even if @xmath107 , where one has to use the exact poisson distribution for the probability distribution of having exactly @xmath108 objects in a halo ( sometimes called a sub - poissonian case ) . the relation @xmath109 also holds .    even in cases where there are objects in common between the two samples ,",
    "the above discussion does not change for the central - satellite pairs , because the two objects are surely different .",
    "however , the existence of the common objects makes assumptions behind the third term in the integrand of eq .",
    "[ eq : pag1h ] invalid .",
    "a detailed discussion of this case is beyond the scope of the present paper , and will be made in a future paper .",
    "the hod of the lrgs has been extensively studied by z09 based on the acf measurements of the lrgs by @xcite using sdss data release ( dr ) 3 .",
    "their @xmath110 model has essentially five parameters , which are the values at five @xmath1 points , and they have spline - interpolation values between these points .",

    "however , their bias parameters for their higher redshift qso samples , all1 & lstar1 ( @xmath271 ) as well as all2 & lstar2 ( @xmath272 ) are lower .    using the power - law fit results including the non - linear regime is useful to detect the different clustering properties between , e.g. , different source populations , luminosities , or types . in our case",
    ", this gives the most statistically significant difference between the clustering properties of the high @xmath36 and low @xmath36 rass - agn samples .",
    "however , one has to be careful in interpreting the results , e.g. , in terms of the dmh mass based on the bias parameter . in principle",
    ", the hod analysis overcomes this limitation , because we are able to derive the pure linear bias parameter , while at the same time utilizing the data in the non - linear regime .      with the hod analysis ,",
    "we can also obtain constraints on at least one additional variable which is independent from the `` mean '' dmh mass , thanks to the constraints from the 1-halo term .",
    "the importance of the 1-halo term constraints has also been noted by @xcite using a similar ccf analysis between photometric - redshift lrg samples and optically - selected qsos in sdss at @xmath273 .",
    "they qualitatively concluded that at least some qsos must be satellites and also that models of the form of our model b ( eq . [ eq : step_pl ] ) with @xmath274 and @xmath275 are also acceptable , while lower @xmath2 values are also possible .",
    "our analysis here gives qualitatively similar results .",
    "the acceptable parameter space for model a is always in the @xmath276 regime for all of our three agn samples : the total , high @xmath36 , and low @xmath36 rass - agn samples .",
    "this means that the average number of agns in a dmh does not increase proportionally with mass .",
    "[ fig : tot_ccf_con](b ) and [ fig : hxlx_con ] show that models with @xmath277 are preferred .",

    ", neither the results nor the assumptions of model a say anything about the central fraction among agns at the lower mass dmhs ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : agnhod_ex ] ) , and thus they do not directly constrain the slope of the satellite agn hod @xmath205 . however , if we take the extreme case where all the agns are satellites , @xmath280 , this would imply that agn fraction among satellite galaxies strongly decrease with @xmath1 . in model b , where the central galaxy component is included explicitly under the assumption that the agn duty cycle in central galaxies is constant against varying @xmath1 above @xmath210 , the best - fit slope is still less than unity ( @xmath221 ) , and models with @xmath281",
    "are only marginally rejected for @xmath215 ( a representative value of luminosity - threshold galaxy samples ) . in case of model c ,",

    "our results tend to favor models in which the agn fraction among satellite galaxies _ decreases _ with increasing dmh mass ( or the richness of groups and clusters ) , in the mass range @xmath284\\la 14.0 $ ] .    since our agn sample is selected from x - ray point sources in rass , and since clusters of galaxies ( which represent the most massive dmhs ) are also x - ray sources , an observational bias that might affect our results is that agns in the clusters are _ selected against _ in the rass - agn sample due to confusion , especially considering that the mean point spread function ( psf ) has a fwhm@xmath164 arcminutes @xcite , which is not negligible when compared to the extent of the cluster x - ray emission .",
    "we have estimated the significance of this effect as follows .",
    "the detection limit of the cluster diffuse x - ray emission is higher than that of point sources .",
    "a typical flux limit for clusters in rass is @xmath285 erg s@xmath21 @xmath286 , ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev)@xcite , corresponding to @xmath287 @xmath288 $ ] at the lower bound of our redshift range of @xmath289 .",
    "this scales to a cluster virial mass of @xmath290 @xcite .",
    "as we found at the end of section [ sec : results_fit ] , our ccf is only sensitive to the hod behavior at @xmath291 , and thus this selection effect should play negligible role in our results . additionally , a confusion due to two or more x - ray agn point sources being artifically blended into a single source by the rass point spread function ( psf ) is not important either , as @xmath292 is much less than unity over all masses ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hods_dens ] ) .",
    "thus we can state with a good degree of confidence that our limits on @xmath2 ( model a ) or @xmath205 ( model b / c ) are not an artifact of x - ray source confusion .    our results of @xmath293 , found in our extensive explorations in the parameter space of the models that we consider , may be interpreted in view of the long - suggested deficiency of emission line diagnostic - selected agns in rich clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while our ccf analysis is not sensitive to rich clusters ( sect .",
    "[ sec : results_fit ] ) , a more recent work by @xcite verified that this trend extends to the group scale by finding an anti - correlation between agn fraction and the galaxy velocity dispersion in nearby ( @xmath294 ) groups / clusters of galaxies down to the velocity dispersion of @xmath295 $ ] .",
    "@xcite also found that the x - ray selected agn ( @xmath296erg s@xmath21 , representing a much lower luminosity population than our agns ) fraction is larger in groups than in clusters by a factor of two at low redshifts ( @xmath297 ) .",
    "various physical mechanisms have been suggested to explain the deficiency of star - formation galaxies in clusters of galaxies , and similar processes might be responsible for the lack of agns as well .",
    "these include ram - pressure stripping @xcite or evaporation @xcite of a galaxy s interstellar medium , which is a required ingredient of the agn activity in galaxies , by the hot intracluster medium .",
    "also , if agn activity is triggered by mergers between two gas - rich galaxies , another possible mechanism for this trend is the decreased cross - section for galaxy mergers in the galaxy - galaxy close encounters at high relative velocities @xcite . in high mass dmhs , representing richer groups / clusters ,",
    "the velocity dispersion is higher and thus one may expect that there are fewer mergers than in groups of galaxies @xcite , although the density of galaxies increase at the center .",
    "other mechanisms such as the accretion of small gas - rich dwarf galaxies ( minor mergers ) may play a role in fueling the agn host , but it is not clear how this would affect the slope @xmath205 .    in order to fully understand the growth history of smbhs as well as the physical processes responsible for the agn activity in groups and clusters , we need to explore the statistics at different redshifts , luminosities , and agn types .",
    "the results mentioned above that investigate agns in groups / clusters are concerned with agn at lower redshifts and with lower luminosities than the agns in our ccf analysis . in the aegis field , @xcite found that agns at @xmath11 are more frequently found in the group environment than the overall galaxy population .",
    "however , deep field surveys such as aegis do not contain a large enough volume to explore the richness dependence of the agn fraction in groups / clusters .",
    "@xcite investigate chandra images of a sample of 33 clusters at @xmath298 , finding that the luminous agn ( @xmath299erg s@xmath21 ) fraction increases with redshift .",
    "they explore the redshift dependence of the agn fraction , but not the richness dependence . at @xmath300 , where the luminosity range of their agns is closer to ours",
    ", they have only two agns in 17 clusters in the redshift range that is similar to our sample . a much larger sample of groups / clusters is needed to explore the richness dependence of the agn fraction in a sufficiently narrow redshift range to avoid any degeneracy with the redshift dependence .    in general , directly investigating agn prevalence in individual groups and clusters is observationally and analytically intensive .",
    "the hod analysis of galaxy - agn ccf provides a strong statistical tool with which to probe the agn population in groups and clusters , which can be made without identifying individual groups and clusters .",
    "thus it is important to extend the hod analysis to agn clustering measurements at higher redshift , especially in view that the fraction of star - forming galaxies in clusters increase with redshift @xcite .",
    "it is also important to have larger numbers of agns for the ccf measurements , which will enable measurements of small - scale clustering and produce stronger constraints on @xmath205 , as well as to break the model degeneracy . using non - lrg galaxies for the ccf to obtain the 1-halo term constraints in the lower @xmath1 regime would also improve the analysis .",
    "linked to our constraints on @xmath2 in model a , we also have weak constraints on the range of @xmath156 .",
    "the range of @xmath156 is similar to that of @xmath210 in model b. using the scaling relations and the luminosity range of our rass - agn samples , we can make an interesting comparison .",

    "( 6 ) with @xcite s recipe , the above black hole mass corresponds to a galaxy halo mass of @xmath310 ( @xmath311 ) @xmath312 $ ] ( for @xmath24 ) .",
    "these masses are comparable or slightly lower than the lower bounds of @xmath156 derived above for those agns emitting at the eddington luminosity and are an order of magnitude lower than our best - fit values . in general",
    ", the concept of the dmh of a galaxy explored by @xcite is different from the dmh derived in our ccf / hod analysis , since the large - scale correlation function reflects the dmh mass as the largest virialized structure the object belongs to .",
    "if the largest virialized structure represents a group or cluster of galaxies , then there are multiple objects in a dmh , and the dmh that is related to @xcite s scaling relation represents a sub - halo in a larger mass halo . while our statistics do not allow for strong constraints , if @xmath156 is close to our nominal value , then the lowest luminosity agns among our samples should be accreting at a sub - eddington rate ( @xmath313 ) or reside in groups .",
