    "there is now strong evidence that the matter density of the universe , both baryonic and dark , is smaller than the critical value predicted by inflation .",
    "some of the same cosmological probes that suggest the ratio of matter density to critical density is less than one prefer the presence of an additional component with energy density such that the total energy density of the universe is in fact the critical value ( e.g. , lineweaver 1998 ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1998 ; riess et al . 1998 ) .",
    "type ia supernovae and other observations have recently provided evidence that the equation of state , @xmath4 , of this component is @xmath5 ( garnavich et al .",
    "1998 ; waga & miceli 1998 ; cooray 1999 ) .",
    "the oldest known candidate for this additional energy is the cosmological constant , characterized by @xmath6 .",
    "however , other possibilities have now been considered , including a slowly - varying , spatially inhomogeneous scalar field component better known as quintessence ( e.g. , huey et al .",
    "1998 ; zlatev et al .",
    "1998 ; wang & steinhardt 1998 ) .",
    "certain quintessence models , called _ tracker models _ ( ferreira & joyce 1997 ; zlatev et al .",
    "1998 ; see steinhardt et al .",
    "1998 for a comprehensive review ) , have the feature that the energy density of the scalar field , @xmath7 , is a fixed fraction of the energy density of the dominant component .",
    "therefore such models may explain the coincidence problem  why @xmath7 is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath8 today .",
    "in these tracker models @xmath4 is a function of redshift , and typically varies from @xmath9 during the radiation dominated era to @xmath10 during the matter - dominated era and finally to a value @xmath11 during late epochs ( today ) .",
    "time variation of the equation of state is even more prominent in scalar field models involving pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons ( pngb models ) ( frieman et al . 1995 ) . in such models",
    "the field is frozen to its initial value due to the large expansion rate , but becomes dynamical at some later stage at redshift @xmath12 .",
    "likely values for @xmath12 are roughly between 3 and 0 ( coble et al .",
    "1997 ) , which means that interesting dynamics  and hence the variation in the equation of state  happen at redshift of a few .",
    "huterer & turner ( 1999 ) point out that distance measurements to type ia supernovae offer a possibility to reconstruct the quintessence potential , while starobinsky ( 1998 ) and wang & steinhardt ( 1998 ) suggested the possibility of using cluster abundances as a function of redshift as well .    in   2 ,",
    "we study constraints on @xmath13 based on current type ia supernovae distances , gravitational lensing statistics , and globular cluster ages . in   3 , we consider the possibility of imposing reliable constraints on @xmath13 based on cosmological probes at high redshift , in particular gravitational lensing statistics .",
    "we follow the conventions that the hubble constant , @xmath14 , is 100@xmath15  km  s@xmath16  mpc@xmath16 , the present matter energy density in units of the closure density is @xmath8 , and the normalized present day energy density in the unknown component is @xmath7 .",
    "since a generic quintessence model has a time - varying equation of state , one should be able to distinguish it from models where the equation of state is time independent ( e.g , turner & white 1997 ) . in this _ letter _ , we write the equation of state of the unknown component as @xmath17 this relation should be a good approximation for most quintessence models out to redshift of a few and , of course , exact for models where @xmath13 is a constant or changing slowly .",
    "note that negative @xmath3 corresponds to an equation of state which is larger today compared to early epochs .",
    "models where the scalar field is initially frozen typically exhibit such behavior , while for tracker field models @xmath18 .    in order to constrain @xmath13 , we extend current published analyses which have so far considered the existence of a redshift - independent equation of state ( e.g. , cooray 1999 ; garnavich et al . 1998 ; waga & miceli 1998 ) . since the only difference between this study and previous ones is that we now allow @xmath4 to vary with @xmath19 , formalisms presented in previous papers should also hold except for the fact that @xmath4 is now redshift dependent .",
    "we refer the reader to previous work for detailed formulae and calculational methods .",

    "current constraints on @xmath20 .",
    "the _ dot - dashed _ lines are the current type ia supernovae ( riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1998 ) constraints at the 95% confidence level , while the upper limits from gravitational lensing statistics ( cooray 1999 ) is shown with _ solid _ lines",
    ". the age of the universe as a function of @xmath21 is show by _ dotted _ lines .",
    "a conservative lower limit on this parameter is 0.8 ( _ dashed _ line ) when age of the universe is @xmath0 14 to 15 gyr and @xmath22 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 .",
    "the _ shaded _ region defines the parameter region allowed by current data .    in fig .  1 we summarize current constraints on @xmath13 as given in equation  1 . here",
    "we have assumed a flat universe with @xmath23 .",
    "evidence for such low matter density , independent of the nature of the additional energy component , comes primarily from the mass density within galaxy clusters ( e.g. , evrard 1997 ) .",
    "as shown in fig  1 , there is a wide range of possibilities for @xmath13 , and the allowed parameter space is consistent with the degeneracies discussed in literature ( e.g. , zlatev et al .",
    "even though the @xmath24 model has been ruled out by combined type ia supernovae , gravitational lensing and globular cluster ages , we now note that a model in which @xmath25 but @xmath26 is fully consistent with the current observational data .    in order to test whether one can constrain @xmath13 better than the current data",
    ", we increased the type ia supernova sample between redshifts of 0.1 to 1 ; however , the degeneracy between @xmath2 and @xmath3 did not change appreciably . increasing",
    "the upper redshift of supernova samples decreased the degeneracies ; thus , cosmological probes at high redshifts are needed to properly distinguish redshift - dependent @xmath13 from a constant @xmath4 model . a probe to a much higher redshift",
    "is provided by the cmb anisotropy data ; however , as pointed out in huterer & turner ( 1998 ) and huey et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , cmb anisotropy is not a strong probe of @xmath13 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath13 affects mostly the lower multipoles , which can not be measured precisely due to cosmic variance .",
    "also , supernovae and galaxy clusters are unlikely to constrain @xmath13 in the near future given that current observational programs are not likely to recover them at high redshifts ( @xmath27 ) .    fig .  2 .",
    "expected number of multiply imaged quasars with image separations between 1 and 6 arcsecs in the sdss data .",
    "we have only counted lensed quasars with at least two images greater than a magnitude limit of 21 .",
    "the expected number is a constant along the @xmath28 lines . for @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    ", we expect @xmath0 2000 lensed sources to be detected within the sdss .",
    "thus , an alternative probe to high redshifts is needed . in the next section",
    "we consider the possibility of using gravitational lensing statistics , in particular the redshift distribution of strongly lensed sources , as a probe of @xmath13 .",
    "such statistics in principle probe the volume of the universe out to a redshift of @xmath0 5 . in the past",
    ", lensing statistics were hampered by the lack of large samples of lensed sources with a well known selection function and their redshift distributions , which are all needed to constrain @xmath13 .",
    "an exciting possibility is now provided by the upcoming high - quality data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; gunn & knapp 1993 ) which is going to image @xmath31 steradians of the sky down to a 1-@xmath32 magnitude limit of @xmath0 23 . since no high redshift ( @xmath27 ) cosmological probes yet exist , gravitational lensing statistics may be the prime candidate to study @xmath13 .",
    "in order to calculate the expected number of lensed quasars , in particular considering the sdss , we extend previous calculations in wallington & narayan ( 1993 ; also , dodelson & macminn 1997 ) and cheng & krauss ( 1998 ) .",
    "our calculation follows that of cooray et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in which we calculated the number of lensed galaxies in the hubble deep field .",
    "we follow the magnification bias ( e.g. , kochanek 1991 ) calculation in cheng & krauss ( 1998 ) .",
    "we calculate the expected number of lensed sources as a function of the magnitude limit of the sdss and select sources with image separations between 1 and 6 arcsecs . this range is selected based on image resolution and source confusion limits .",
    "our prediction , shown in fig .",
    "2 as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath33 , is based on current determination of the quasar luminosity function , which is likely to be updated once adequate quasars statistics are available from the sdss .",
    "as shown , there are about 2000 lensed quasars down to a limiting magnitude of 21 that could in principle be detected from the sdss data if @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this number drops to about @xmath0 600 when @xmath34 ; however , such a cosmological model is already ruled out by current data . in this calculation , we have ignored effects due to extinction and dust ; this is an issue with no consensus among various studies ( malhotra et al .",
    "1997 ; falco et al .",
    "it is likely that a combined analysis of statistics from ongoing lensed radio sources and optical searches may increase knowledge on such systematic effects .",
    "the sdss lensed quasars lie in redshifts out to @xmath35 5 .",
    "detection of such high redshift lensed sources is likely to be aided by the 5 color imaging data , including the @xmath19-filter .",
    "this possibility has already been demonstrated by the detection of some of the highest redshift quasars known today using the sdss first year test images ( fan et al .",
    "in order to estimate the accuracy to which one can constrain @xmath13 based on gravitational lensing statistics , we take a fisher matrix approach with parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and assume a flat universe . as stated in literature ( e.g. , tegmark et al .",
    "1997 ) , fisher matrix analysis allows one to estimate the best statistical errors on parameters calculated from a given data set .",
    "the fisher matrix @xmath36 is given by :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the likelihood of observing data set @xmath39 given the parameters @xmath40 .",
    "we bin the observations ( number of lensed quasars ) in redshift bins of width @xmath41 out to a maximum redshift @xmath42 .",
    "since the selection function for quasar discovery process is still unknown , we adopt a poisson likelihood function at each redshift bin @xmath41 centered at redshift @xmath19 .",
    "the expected number of lensed sources , @xmath43 , in each redshift bin takes into account the magnitude limit , range of allowed image separations as well as the magnification bias . with these approximations ,",
    "we can now write the fisher matrix as :    @xmath44    this form for the fisher matrix is identical to the one derived from a gaussian distribution when the uncertainty ( @xmath32 ) of the distribution is taken to be equal to the shot - noise term @xmath45 .    fig .",
    "3 .  constraints ( 2-@xmath32 ) on @xmath2 and @xmath3 using lensed source redshift distribution expected from the sdss for a fiducial cosmological model of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and marginalised over @xmath8 ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "we show the expected 2@xmath32 errors when the redshift distribution of lensed sources is known with an accuracy of 0.1 and 0.3 while the maximum redshift probed by lensing statistics is 3 and 5 .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the expected ( 2-@xmath32 ) uncertainties in @xmath2 and @xmath3 . here",
    "we considered a flat universe with three parameters , @xmath8 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "we marginalised over @xmath8 allowing @xmath50 ( 1-@xmath32 ) and considered a fiducial model with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the three curves in fig",
    ".  3 show variation of the constraint region with the redshift bin width @xmath41 ( which is roughly equal to the uncertainty in the redshift determination ) and with the maximum redshift of detected quasars @xmath42 .",
    "photometric redshifts now allow redshift determinations with an accuracy of order 0.1 68% of the time and of order 0.3 100% of the time ( e.g. , hogg et al . 1998 ) .",
    "it is apparent that the size of the constraint region decreases significantly with increasing @xmath42 and decreasing @xmath41 .",
    "note that one can quite safely assume that @xmath51 for quasars in a survey such as the sdss .",
    "additionally , these calculations assume a limiting magnitude of 21 , much lower than the expected 1-@xmath52 limiting magnitude of 23 for the sdss data .",

    "4 shows constraints in the @xmath2 ",
    "@xmath3 plane for four fiducial models .",
    "models shown are the cosmological constant ( @xmath53 ) , non - abelian cosmic strings ( @xmath54 ; spergel & pen 1997 ) and two quintessence models exhibiting a variation in @xmath4 at small @xmath19 ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) . in all cases we assumed a flat universe and marginalised over @xmath8 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "we also assumed that redshifts of lensed objects are determined with an accuracy @xmath57 and that we have data out to redshift of @xmath58 .",
    "this figure shows that the strength of the constraints depends strongly on the fiducial model .",
    "in fact , we found that fiducial models for which @xmath59 ( for @xmath19 of order unity ) give weaker constraints .",
    "this result is not surprising and can be understood by simply using the fact that number of lensed objects out to a redshift of @xmath19 is roughly proportional to the volume of the universe @xmath60 .",
    "since @xmath61 ( where @xmath62 is either @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) is proportional to @xmath63 , we see that the expected number of lensed quasars varies slowly with @xmath62 if @xmath64 . in that case",
    ", our constraint region will be relatively large .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we considered the possibility of constraining quintessence models that have been suggested to explain the missing energy density of the universe .",
    "we suggested gravitational lensing statistics , which can be used as a probe of the equation of state of the missing component , @xmath13 . an exciting possibility to obtain an adequate sample of lensed quasars and their redshifts comes from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "writing @xmath65 , we studied the expected accuracy to which equation of state today @xmath2 and its rate of change @xmath3 can simultaneously be constrained .",
    "adopting some conservative assumptions about the quality of the data from sdss and assuming a flat universe with @xmath66 , we conclude that tight constraints on these two parameters can indeed be obtained .",
