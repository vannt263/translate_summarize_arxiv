    "<S> clearly , the dimension function is locally constant on the stable set .    on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we shall prove that on the bifurcation set the dimension function @xmath4 has the following strong self - parametrizing property : @xmath22    to state the result precisely , let us define the _ local hlder exponent _ of a function @xmath23 at a point @xmath24 as the limit @xmath25 the main theorem is the following .    </S>",

    "<S> it is differentiable at @xmath31 .    at @xmath28 , the function is not hlder continuous , and we shall show that its modulus of continuity is of order @xmath32 ( see proposition [ p : modulus ] ) .    moreover , </S>",
    "<S> the intervals where the function is constant correspond precisely to the connected components of the stable set , and these are characterized in terms of _ lyndon words _ ( see below ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the dimension function @xmath26 is directly related to other quantities which have been widely studied . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , if we denote @xmath33 the set of points which do not fall into the hole under the first @xmath34 iterates , one defines the _ escape rate _ </S>",

    "<S> moreover , if we denote by @xmath39 the topological entropy of the restriction of the map @xmath13 to @xmath1 , one has the relation ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath40    the set @xmath1 is also related to the problem of diophantine approximation ( see @xcite ) : in fact , if one considers the set @xmath41 of points which are not well - approximable ( in a suitable sense ) by dyadic numbers , then one has for any @xmath42 $ ] @xmath43    one important tool for the proof of theorem [ t : local_h ] is a formula , due to urbaski ( @xcite , pg . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , if one considers the function @xmath57 which expresses the ( normalized ) topological entropy of a real quadratic polynomial @xmath58 as a function of its external angle @xmath59 ( or equivalently , as a function of its kneading sequence ) then it is also expected that the local hlder exponent of @xmath39 at @xmath0 equals the value of the function @xmath39 ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite , sec . </S>",

    "<S> note that in this case the _ kneading series _ of @xcite plays the same role as the power series @xmath51 in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this case the modulus of continuity at the smallest @xmath0 where @xmath60 ( the feigenbaum parameter ) is of order @xmath61 ( see e.g. @xcite , section 9.1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> another more complicated , non - monotone case where the local hlder exponent is at least conjectured to equal the value of the function at every point is given by the ( normalized ) _ core entropy _ </S>",
    "<S> function for quadratic polynomials introduced by w. thurston ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    the underlying phenomenon , of which theorem [ t : local_h ] provides a quantitative statement in a specific case , seems to be that systems with low entropy are less stable than systems with high entropy , in the sense that a small perturbation leads to a large variation in entropy . </S>",
    "<S> it would be of great interest to investigate to what extent is this phenomenon universal . </S>"
