    "the gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric dust cloud is described by the tolman - bondi - lematre ( tbl)@xcite models .",
    "these models have been extensively studied for the validity of the cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite . in particular , it is known @xcite now that depending upon the initial conditions , which are defined in terms of the initial density and velocity profiles from which the collapse develops , the central shell - focusing singularity at @xmath0 can be either a black hole , or a locally or globally naked singularity .",
    "further , it has been shown recently that this singularity is always gravitationally strong @xcite along a family of timelike geodesics , indicating the physical nature and significance of the singularity .",
    "there have also been recent studies which examine the stability and other aspects in this case @xcite .",
    "one may thus state that the final fate of gravitational collapse is reasonably well - understood for the dust collapse models .",
    "the same however can not be said here about the causal structure of the singularity , on which several aspects are still not clear , especially when it is naked .",
    "it is the behaviour of null geodesics families , closer to the singularity , that give us an idea of the causal structure there .",
    "most of the earlier works on dust collapse have concentrated mainly on establishing the occurrence of black holes and naked singularities in tbl models under various sets of initial conditions . for the case of a black hole forming in dust collapse ,",
    "the behaviour of null geodesics families around and close to the event horizon is rather well - known and fully explored . however",
    ", this is not the case for the behaviour of null geodesics in the vicinity of a naked singularity , which is largely unknown .",
    "we take up here a study of the behaviour of radial geodesics in the neighbourhood of a naked singularity .",
    "we bring out the interesting behaviour of null trajectories near naked singularities , and it is in this sense that we explore this causal structure here .",
    "understanding such issues is clearly going to be important if there is any interesting physics to come out due to the existence of a naked singularity .",
    "even from the perspective of obtaining a suitable formulation of cosmic censorship , such an understanding should be helpful and necessary .",
    "our purpose here is to investigate the nature and causal structure of this singularity by means of examining the behaviour of null as well as timelike geodesics families in the tbl models .",
    "this provides a better understanding of the structure of this singularity , and clarifies several related issues .",
    "it is seen from our considerations here that there is a single ingoing radial null geodesic ( rng ) terminating at the singularity with a well - defined tangent , and that there is a single rng ( the cauchy horizon ) coming out along one direction , and a family of rngs coming out in the other direction in all the cases in which the singularity is naked .",
    "we also show that there is a family of radial timelike and radial spacelike geodesics coming out of the singularity with well - defined tangents .",
    "we explicitly show these results for cases which were not studied so far . in some other cases , where one had some idea on the behaviour of the rngs ,",
    "the earlier results can again be reconfirmed from the present calculations .",
    "in particular , with our scaling when the physical radius ( @xmath1 ) along the geodesics is proportional to a power of the comoving radius ( @xmath2 ) less than 3 , it is seen that there is only one ingoing radial null geodesic ( rng ) terminating at the singularity , and one rng coming out along the direction of cauchy horizon as stated above .",
    "further , there is a family of radial null and timelike geodesics coming out of the singularity along the direction of the apparent horizon .",
    "in fact , earlier it was claimed in @xcite , giving an evidence for the numerical results obtained there , that in certain cases there is a family of rngs coming out of the singularity along the apparent horizon .",
    "here we explicitly bring out the existence of such a family , and show that the results can be generalized for timelike and spacelike geodesics as well .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces the tbl model and the gravitational collapse . in section 3",
    "we study the various singular geodesics , and geodesic families . in the concluding section 4",
    "we discuss the overall scenario , and the possibility of generalizing these results .",
    "the metric for the tbl models in comoving coordinates is written as ,    ds^2= -dt^2 + r^2dr^2 + r^2d^2 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is that of dust , t^ij=^i_t ^j_t , = ( t , r)=fr^2 r , where @xmath3 is the energy density , and the area radius @xmath4 is given by r^2 = f(r ) + f(r)r . here the dot and prime denote partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates @xmath5 and @xmath2 respectively , and for the case of collapse we have @xmath6 . the functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 are called the mass and energy functions respectively , and they are related to the initial mass and velocity distribution in the cloud .    for a marginally bound cloud ( @xmath9 ) ,",
    "the integration of equation ( 3 ) gives t - t_0(r)=-2r^3/23f , where @xmath10 is a constant of integration .",
    "using the coordinate freedom for scaling the radial coordinate @xmath2 we set , r(0,r)=r , which gives , t_0(r)=2r^3/23 . at the time @xmath11 the shell labelled by the coordinate radius @xmath2 becomes singular because the area radius @xmath1 of the shell becomes zero then .",
    "here we consider only the situation where there are no shell - crossings in the spacetime .",
    "a sufficient condition for this is that the density be a decreasing function of @xmath2 , which may be considered to be a physically reasonable requirement , because for any realistic density profile the density should be higher at the center , decreasing away from the center .",
    "the ranges of coordinates are given by , 0 r < , -0@xmath12u = r^@xmath131@xmath14x = r / u@xmath15x@xmath16@xmath17@xmath18u(x , u)=dr / du@xmath19x = x_0@xmath20@xmath21@xmath22n<3@xmath23=1 + 2n/3<3@xmath24x_0= ( -f_n/2f_0)^2/3@xmath25 , and",

    "this is the same result as shown earlier by joshi and dwivedi . in this case when the singularity is naked there are two real positive roots for the root equation , @xmath81 . so along one root @xmath82 is negative and along the other it is positive . as the coefficient of highest power of @xmath83 in @xmath84 is negative , along the larger root @xmath82",
    "is negative while along the smaller root it is positive .",
    "that means along the larger root we have @xmath85 , and we can have only one rng coming out along that direction ( with @xmath86 ) . along the smaller root @xmath87",
    "and we have an infinite family of rngs coming out along this direction .",
    "now let us see what happens in the @xmath88 , i.e @xmath89 cases , along the apparent horizon direction .",
    "in this case we need to keep the two lowest order terms to make sure that we have the apparent horizon as a tangent near the singularity . in this case , to the lowest required order , the equation becomes , @xmath90 this , after integration gives , w(r ) e^nf_n 6(3-n)f_0 ^ 5/21r^3-n .",
    "that means @xmath91 goes to zero exponentially and we have a family of rngs coming out of the singularity with the apparent horizon kind of behaviour .           the fig . 1 and fig",
    ". 2 show the plots of the geodesics equations .",
    "1 shows the plots for @xmath92 , and fig .",
    "2 shows the plots for @xmath93 .",
    "we have also plotted the apparent horizon , and the analytical form of the geodesic equation near the singularity with first correction to @xmath7 [ 4 ] , i.e.    @xmath94 .",
    "it matches very well the actual geodesic equations near the singularity .",
    "1(b ) and fig .",
    "2(b ) show the error in analytical approximation against the numerical solution at different values of @xmath2 near the singularity .",
    "we see that the first corrected result to @xmath7 matches much better with the actual trajectories near the singularity .",
    "the plots also give strong numerical evidence that there is a family of rngs meeting the singularity along the apparent horizon .",
    "the deviation of geodesics from each other seems to be very drastic as they move out . in other words , near the center all the singular geodesics converge very fast and fall on each other as predicted by our analytic calculation .",
    "coming to timelike geodesics , by using the set of differential equations ( [ gs]-[root ] ) for the geodesics , and using self - consistency requirements , the approximate solution for the timelike geodesics near the central singularity along the normal root direction ( @xmath95 ) can be written as , k^t=1+c^22c",
    "r^1-n/31-c^22c + higher order terms , r(t , r)=x_0r^1 + 2n/3 , here @xmath96 is a constant labeling different geodesics corresponding to the particles having different energies at a given point in spacetime , and the signs @xmath97 represent outgoing and ingoing geodesics .",
    "the case @xmath98 was discussed in [ 5 ] .",
    "so we see that when @xmath99 the timelike and spacelike geodesics have the same limiting tangent at the singularity as that of the rngs terminating at the singularity .",
    "thus all the geodesics go along the same direction , which we would not have expected to happen typically .",
    "let us now look for timelike radial geodesics coming out of the central @xmath100 singularity along the apparent horizon , if they exist , i.e. with the behaviour @xmath101 . assuming such geodesics to exist , and using the set of differential equations ( [ gs ] - [ root ] ) for the timelike geodesics and solving them in an approximate manner near the singularity , we get , k^t = cexp . here",
    "different values of @xmath102 represents different geodesics corresponding to the particles having different energies at a given point in the spacetime like in the earlier equation .",
    "we see that @xmath103 and @xmath104 blow up exponentially , making @xmath105 , and to the lowest orders , near the singularity the @xmath106 equation becomes the same as that of the null geodesics . along any other directions ( i.e. apart from the larger root , which is the cauchy horizon direction , and the apparent horizon direction , and the two special cases discussed earlier@xcite ) , we get contradiction while solving the set of differential equations for the geodesics . that means these are the only possible behaviours for the geodesics near the singularity . and because @xmath103 diverges very rapidly near the central singularity , all the arguments and calculations given above for null geodesics also hold for timelike geodesics , i.e. families of timelike and null geodesics come out of the singularity along the apparent horizon direction near the central singularity .",
    "if one also solves the set of differential equations for spacelike geodesics in a self - consistent manner , then one can see that even the spacelike geodesics have a behaviour very similar to that of null geodesics near the central singularity .",
    "3 shows the timelike geodesics . within a given range",
    ", timelike geodesics starting from the singularity can meet the boundary of the cloud at the same time with different velocities , and there is also a family of such geodesics which meet the boundary of the cloud at different times as shown in this figure .",
    "this implies that in some region , at every point in the spacetime we have timelike geodesics coming out of the singularity with apparent horizon as tangent at the singularity and meeting that point with different velocities .       though we have considered here the marginally bound case @xmath9 for the sake of clarity and simplicity , the results are easily generalized for non - marginal cases as well .",
    "they essentially depend upon the value of the parameter @xmath107 which is chosen such that @xmath108 remains finite in the limit of approach to the singularity along the trajectories coming out . in the @xmath109 cases",
    ", we again get a family of rngs coming out of the singularity along the apparent horizon .",
    "this happens because in general along the outgoing rngs ( here for simplicity we discuss only null geodesics ) @xmath110 , so even with @xmath111 we again have situations with @xmath112 , such that the first term in bracket goes to zero and the second term blows up but their product remains finite , giving the value of the tangent to be @xmath113 .",
    "finally , we make here some remarks in order to clarify the situation regarding the strength of the naked singularity for the cases we have considered here . as we indicated earlier , the singularity in this model is always gravitationally strong@xcite . we discuss this in some detail below .",
    "the basic idea , in order to examine the strength of a singularity ( naked or otherwise ) , is to examine the rate of curvature growth along the non - spacelike geodesics terminating in the singularity , in the limit of approach to the singularity .",
    "there are many criteria available for this purpose , as we point out below .",
    "according to the definitions of strength of a singularity as given by tipler @xcite there are _ two _ criteria given to check the strength . according to one definition , a divergence condition to be satisfied is , @xmath114 should go as @xmath115 ( @xmath116 is the affine parameter along the geodesic , vanishing in the limit of approach to the singularity ) as one goes to the singularity , along _ every _ geodesic coming out , and also for the ingoing ones . according to the second definition of tipler ,",
    "the singularity is strong if this divergence condition is satisfied along at least _",
    "one _ trajectory terminating in the singularity .",
    "we like to use this later definition of strength , because there is practically no way available to check the earlier definition operationally , because it is nearly impossible to integrate all non - spacelike geodesics in most of the collapse scenarios . also , considering the complexity of the field equations , for most of the collapse models ( consider e.g. the well - known case of vaidya - papapetrou radiation collapse ) , there is going to be some kind of a directional dependence always in the behaviour of the curvature growth in the limit of approach to the singularity .",
    "a uniform kind of curvature dependence in all directions does not seem plausible .",
    "thus , it looks extremely reasonable to make the statement that the geodesic ends in a strong curvature singularity provided the curvatures grow as per the above requirement along it , rather than defining the strength as some kind of an absolute property of the singularity .",
    "in fact , there are other criteria as well proposed and available to check the strength . for example , according to the criterion given by krolak @xcite ( see e.g. @xcite ) , a divergence @xmath114 going as @xmath117 is sufficient to call the singularity strong .",
    "according to this criterion as well , clearly the naked singularities considered here are all strong curvature singularities along _ every _ null geodesic terminating in the singularity .",
    "there have also been some recent general considerations on strength by nolan @xcite , according to which practically all shell - focusing singularities occurring in spherically symmetric spacetimes are gravitationally strong .",
    "taking all these considerations into account , it would appear quite reasonable to treat the naked singularities considered here to be strong curvature ones , which are physically important and not removable from the spacetime in a classical manner .",
    "we have explored here the behaviour of null geodesics in the vicinity of the naked singularity developing in the gravitational collapse of a dust cloud . together with the earlier information available in this connection ( especially in the case @xmath118 ) , this provides a rather complete picture of how null trajectories traverse away from the naked singularity .",
    "we also see that there are ingoing and outgoing timelike geodesics terminating at the central naked singularity , and they have a behaviour very similar to that of the null geodesics when near the central singularity .",
    "this is an intriguing phenomenon and because of this in many cases it may become difficult to decide whether a given vector is null , timelike or spacelike at the central singularity .",
    "this can happen because normally while doing calculations in such cases we finally use some approximations and take limits .",
    "we further showed that there is a family of radial null ( as well as radial timelike geodesics ) coming out of the singularity with the same ultimate tangent as that of the apparent horizon , when the parameter @xmath89 , i.e. the geodesics have @xmath119 kind of behaviour as we approach the singularity .",
    "very similar results can be obtained for spacelike geodesics also . for timelike geodesics in @xmath120 case",
    "again we get results quite similar to that of null geodesics , as @xmath103 has a power - law divergence near the singularity . even in collapse scenarios more general than dust",
    "we can expect a similar phenomenon , i.e. in the cases corresponding to @xmath109 , we expect a family of geodesics coming out with @xmath119 kind of behaviour as the general structure of @xmath106 equation looks very similar . these results provide us with an insight into the causal structure in the vicinity of the naked singularity .",
