    "recent claims by yadav and wandelt @xcite of the detection of strong primordial non - gaussianity in the three - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data @xcite have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the early universe .",
    "these results were also found in the wmap five - year analysis , although with less statistical significance @xcite .",
    "the strength of the non - gaussianity detected in their analysis is more than two orders of magnitude larger than the non - gaussianity expected in the simplest model of single field , slow roll model of inflation @xcite .",
    "this detection , if it stands up to scrutiny , will be the first definitive indication that the simplest model of inflation can not adequately explain all of the current cosmological observations and must be modified in some way .    in yadav and wandelt s analysis @xcite , the detection of the non - gaussian signal is due to the simultaneous reduction in the estimator s error bars and the shift in the central value as smaller angular scale information was included in the analysis .",
    "one obvious concern is that the estimator is contaminated by foreground emission , in particular radio points sources and the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect which become increasingly more important on small angular scales .    in this paper",
    "we will analyze the influence of point sources , for the experiment resolution of wmap both the radio sources and sz clusters effectively act as point sources , on the standard non - gaussianity estimator .",
    "while it has been claimed that the non - gaussianity caused by poisson fluctuations in the number density of radio point sources can be safely separated from the primordial non - gaussian signal @xcite , we will demonstrate the other forms of point source non - gaussianity can not be safely ignored .",
    "in addition to the standard forms of non - gaussianity produced by point sources , we will show that cross - correlation between the point source power spectrum and the cmb temperature anisotropies or instrument noise will produce non - gaussianity of a very similar form as the local model .",
    "the local model is the form typically assumed in analyses of primordial non - gaussianity , so these new non - gaussian contributions will bias the estimator in a fashion that can not easily be corrected .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : ps ] we demonstrate that point sources can produce a bispectrum that has the same form as the local model . in  [ sec : bias ] we derive the bias induced by the various point source bispectra . in  [ sec : conc ] we conclude .",
    "we use the wmap three - year cosmological model @xcite for numerical calculations .",
    "while non - gaussianity generically implies that any higher - order connected correlation function is non - zero , it is typical to focus on the three - point correlation function , or equivalently the bispectrum , because it has the simplest form of all non - gaussian correlation functions and for weak non - gaussianity it contains the nearly all of the information @xcite .",
    "the three - point correlation function can be factored into a component fixed by rotational invariance , which is assumed _ a prioiri _ , and a piece determined by the underlying mechanism that produced the non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "rotational invariance forces the three - point correlation function to be proportional to the gaunt integral , @xmath5 and the cmb three - point correlation function can be written as @xmath6 where the reduced bispectrum , @xmath7 , contains information about the form of non - gaussianity .",
    "the estimators used in cmb non - gaussianity analyses are optimized for the detection of a signal with a very particular form , namely the local model @xcite .",
    "the local model assumes that the initial curvature perturbations can be written as @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is gaussian .",
    "the non - linear terms in this model lead to the following bispectrum for the initial curvature perturbations @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the power spectrum .",
    "the ordinary linear radiative transfer function are subsequently used to calculate the cmb temperature anisotropies from these initial curvature perturbations .",
    "the statistical properties of the cmb temperature anisotropies will mirror the statistical properties of underlying curvature perturbations since we are consider linear radiative transfer .",
    "the levels of non - gaussianity claimed by yadav & wandelt are significantly larger than the expected non - gaussianity produced by non - linear radiative transfer .",
    "however the estimators are sensitive to any bispectrum form that might be present in the data , regardless of its origin . in this section",
    "we will determine the induced bias produced by the various cross - correlation bispectra described in the next section .",
    "the non - gaussianity estimator can be expressed as @xcite @xmath12,\\ ] ] where the normalization is @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the sum of the cmb signal and noise .",
    "the cmb experimental noise parameters are described in table [ table : exp_info ] .",
    "we are ignoring the additional linear term in the estimator because the contribution of radio point source will not bias this piece of the estimator if the signal and noise covariance matrices well represent the real data .",
    "the weight functions used in the estimator are optimized for a bispectrum produced by the local model",
    ". the estimator bias will be determined by substituting the various forms of the point sources bispectra into the estimator @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the one of the reduced bispectrum produced by point sources .",
    "the cmb bispectrum produced by the local model is generally negative .",
    "the collapsed triangle modes , which have the highest signal - to - noise , are always negative .",
    "so a positive point source bispectrum will cause a negative estimator bias .",
    "we will now discuss the possible bispectrum terms .",
    "the observed signal is the sum of the primordial and secondary temperature anisotropies , foreground emission and instrument noise . while the secondary anisotropies and extra - galactic foregrounds , which maybe quite non - gaussian , are important on small angular scales , the signal on the large angular scales relevant for wmap is dominated by primary anisotropies .",
    "thus it is assumed that any measured non - gaussianity by wmap is primordial in nature .",
    "we will argue that cross - correlations between some of these signals may induce bispectra on large angular scales .",
    "moreover these bispectra may have similar forms as the local model if the signal power spectrum becomes spatial inhomogeneous in manner that then correlates with a second component in the observed signal .",
    "for example , the matter overdensity will bias the local radio point source power spectrum and it will be correlated with the cmb temperature anisotropies produced via the isw effect .",
    "this will produce a bispectrum similar in form to the local model .",
    "this is not a coincidence as the non - gaussianity in the local model is produced by the modulation of the small scale inflaton power spectrum by the large scale inflaton fluctuations that have already left the horizon and frozen out .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is a measure of the non - linear coupling between these different scales .",
    "likewise the large scale matter overdensity modulates the small scale poisson fluctuation power spectrum by altering the local number density of radio point sources . in an analogous fashion",
    "the bias describes the coupling between the different scales .",
    "as discussed in the previous section any bispectrum present in the data can bias the estimator .",
    "now we will discuss the various physical effects considered in this paper  radio point source emission , the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect and the integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "the temperature anisotropy induced by unresolved radio point sources can be expressed as an integral over their flux distribution function @xmath17 the conversion between the temperature and intensity fluctuations is @xmath18 where @xmath19 k and @xmath20 is a blackbody frequency distribution .    note that we have allowed both the upper flux limit for unresolved radio point sources and their number density to be spatially inhomogeneous . as we will describe below",
    ", these spatial inhomogeneities will correlate with other signals present in the data to produce bispectra in the observed cmb data .",
    "the actual values for the bispectra calculated in this paper depend on the radio point sources properties ( both flux and redshift distributions ) and on the flux cut at a given frequency for a specific experiment . in order to evaluate the residual point source contribution to the total estimated bispectrum in the wmap3yrs data",
    ", we must consider the technique used by wmap to identify and substract radio point sources @xcite and the point source mask applied to the data .",
    "the wmap source selection criterion does not correspond to a single flux threshold at a given frequency , rather it requires that a candidate source should be seen with a minimal statistical significance in all channels @xcite . as yadav & wandelt s results @xcite , which are the motivation for this paper , were derived using the v and w frequencies bands , the radio point source populations at these frequencies is the most relevant .",
    "unfortunately , as most radio sources are stronger at low frequencies , they tend to be detected with higher significance in the k  q bands than in the v  w ones .",
    "in addition from a blind search , at 2030 ghz it is possible to use lower  frequency catalogs of point sources as tracers for detection @xcite . as a result",
    ", the source population at such frequencies is much better characterized than the one at higher frequencies . by considering flux number counts at low frequencies it is possible to give an estimate of the flux above which the detected point sources create a complete catalog .",
    "this flux threshold is estimated to be above 1.1 jy at 23 ghz ( k band ) @xcite , while in the w band ( 94 ghz ) the number counts are not sufficiently well determined to allow such estimate .",
    "an alternative blind search technique applied to the wmap v and w band data increases the number of sources found in the v band by 50% compared to the wmap team results @xcite .",
    "these results include some sources that were not contained in the wmap point source mask .",
    "the new sources found , however , do not seem to represent a different population than the ones previously detected .",
    "as the wmap 5 year data is now available , more work on point source characterization at the frequencies where the cmb science is derived should be possible .",
    "the actual residual contribution of point sources depends upon the mask applied to the observed map . in the case of wmap",
    ", this mask considers the wmap detected sources ( about 300 ) as well as some bright sources from other low  frequencies catalogs , for a total of approximately seven hundred sources masked . the actual selection function that this procedure imposes at the v and w bands",
    "is poorly understood , and indeed some sources detected by @xcite were not masked . however , while the detection threshold implied by this whole procedure is poorly defined , there is good agreement in the residual point sources power spectrum contribution as derived by different authors @xcite .",
    "this can be approximately translated in a flux threshold of 0.6 jy in the q band @xcite and 0.75 jy in the v band @xcite . for illustrative purposes",
    ", we will adopt here an approximate estimate for the flux cut - off of 0.7 jy in all wmap bands . in  [ sec : results ] we discuss the dependence of our results on this choice .",
    "the planck satellite will have better resolution and sensitivity , resulting in a lower detection threshold for point sources . in the following ,",
    "we make predictions of the bispectrum expected in the final planck maps , considering the detection thresholds for a 95% complete sample derived by @xcite using realistic planck sky simulations .",
    "the flux cut - offs for both wmap and planck , as well as , the adopted instrument noise parameters are given in table [ table : exp_info ] .",
    ".[table : exp_info ] radio point source flux threshold , fwhm , and instrument pixel noise ( in @xmath21 ) for the relevant wmap and planck frequency bands . for wmap",
    "the various band names are also listed . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    finally , in order to compute the bispectra implied by point sources below a given flux , we adopt the source counts predictions of toffolatti et al @xcite rescaled by a factor 0.8 , as suggested by the matching of these predictions with the actual number counts at fluxes above 1.1 at 41 ghz obtained by @xcite .",
    "we will use the radio point source bias @xmath22 @xcite as inferred for low frequency radio point sources .",
    "this value is uncertain and almost definite varies for the various population type that constitute the high frequency sample .",
    "it is difficult to constrain the redshift distribution due to the lack of optical studies of @xmath23 source population , work at @xmath24 has been conducted by gonzalez et al . for fluxes above 1",
    "jy @xcite . at these fluxes and frequencies",
    "the number counts are dominated by qsos for relatively high redshifts .",
    "this population is well approximated by the following analytical formula : @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 is 0.4 ( 0.9 ) for @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this redshift distribution is in agreement with recent studies of radio sources populations at  90 ghz with atca @xcite . in addition",
    ", there is a small ( 1015 % ) of the total population that consists of radio loud galaxies which peaks at much lower redshifts ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "given the small number of sources , it is difficult to derive an appropriate fitting formula for this other population . in the following , we will adopt the following distribution of low redshift sources @xmath31 that provides a better fit to counts found by gonzalez et al .",
    "we will take the sum of eqs.[eq : n_ps ] & [ eq : n_pslow ] with a common proportionality factor determined by requiring @xmath32 to integrate to unity over the range @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",

    ", we also do calculations with the model of gonzalez @xcite ; this will be called model 2 .",
    "wmap only resolves the high - flux sources which are typically dominated by agn .",
    "most likely lower flux sources consist of a different population ( e.g. @xcite ) and therefore have a different redshift distribution with possibly more weight either at lower or higher redshifts .",
    "an analogous redshift analysis on higher frequencies catalog is strongly needed , but is not available at this time .",
    "future investigations of radio point sources catalogs plus wmap and planck results are higher frqeuencies will help clarify this issue . for the aims of this paper",

    "the radio point source magnification modulation bispectrum is the most important so the bias is positive . at higher frequencies the sz density modulation bispectrum dominates which makes the bias negative .",

    "[ fig : cross_power ]  [ fig : mag_bispect ] , the differences between the radio point source redshift distributions , model 1 and model 2 , are not significant .",
    "this is not surprising as the isw kernel , with which the radio point source redshift distributions are being cross - correlated , is quite broad .",
    "the redshift distributions are supposed to trace both the high  flux source populations at low frequencies .",

    "the decrease in the flux cut - off will decrease the poisson fluctuation power spectrum , so the change in the bias of the @xmath0 estimator is not clear .",
    "we also note that reducing the flux cut  off from the wmap to the planck level does not reduce the bias implied on @xmath0 as the planck noise levels and beam sizes are also smaller .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the effect of point sources , both due to radio emission and the cluster sz effect , on the estimation of primordial non - gaussianity in the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the standard non - gaussianity estimator is sensitive to any bispectrum present in the data .",
    "in addition to the standard poisson fluctuation bispectrum , we found that cross - correlations between the radio point source and sz power spectra and either the cmb temperature anisotropies or instrument noise can produce bispectra .",
    "these bispectra have forms somewhat similar to the local model , which is the standard bispectrum form used to search for primordial non - gaussianity in cmb data .",
    "these similarities are not accidental , but occur because the same basic principle generates the non - gaussianity in these cases . due to this similarity it will be much more difficult to distinguish this non - gaussianity from the primordial signal than other secondary bispectra with shapes which can be quite different .    a related paper by serra & cooray @xcite has examined different secondary bispectra , but has reached similar conclusions .",
    "they examined the bispectra produced by the cross - correlation of the thermal sz effect and the gravitational lensing of the primary cmb anisotropies .",
    "they concluded that the effects are too small to account for the infered values of @xmath0 from the wmap data and will start to become important for the planck dataset .",
    "the estimator bias that we have calculated is quite small and is not able to explain the results found by yadav & wandelt , although the bispectra considered in our paper will start to become important for the planck non - gaussianity analysis . due to the extremely important nature of the detection of primordial non - gaussianity in the wmap data ,",
