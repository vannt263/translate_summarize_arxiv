    "one of the major difficulties in developing quantum technologies , such as quantum computers , @xcite are different kinds of specifically quantum dynamical instabilities that can occur due to interactions between different degrees of freedom and resonant interaction with the external fields .",
    "instabilities in quantum systems have different nature than instabilities in classical systems , in which such kind of phenomenon as dynamical chaos occurs as a result of exponential divergence of initially close trajectories . in quantum systems , the notion of a trajectory is not well defined .",
    "this is one of the main reasons why most of well - developed methods for stability analysis can not be directly applied to quantum systems .    in this paper",
    "the dynamics of a harmonic oscillator in a monochromatic wave field is studied .",
    "this system describes , in particular , a quantum dynamics of a cold ion trapped in a linear ion trap and interacting with two laser fields with close frequencies.@xcite our attention is focused mainly on classical and quantum behavior in the region of parameters close to the quantum ground state ( qgs ) of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "this case corresponds to classical dynamics in the vicinity of the point ( @xmath10 ) in the phase space .",
    "we shall call the corresponding region of parameters for the classical system a `` classical ground state '' ( cgs ) of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "the stability of the cgs and the qgs at stable and chaotic classical regimes is analyzed for different parameters of the model . in sec .",
    "ii , we consider classical dynamics in the vicinity of the cgs in the exact resonance case , @xmath7 . in this situation",
    "the system we study is degenerate,@xcite and an infinitely small perturbation generates in the classical phase space an infinite number of the `` resonance cells '' separated by the infinite stochastic web .",
    "a classical dynamics inside the resonance cells at small @xmath6 is described by using the resonance perturbation theory.@xcite it is shown , that in the vicinity of the cgs ( the `` central cell '' ) , and for small enough @xmath6 , the dynamics in the case @xmath7 is unstable for resonance numbers @xmath11 and stable for @xmath12 .",
    "we show that in spite of the `` resonant hamiltonian '' describes many features of the dynamics inside the resonance cells , it can not be used for describing the stability of the system in the central cell , at @xmath12 .",
    "the classical dynamics in this region is determined , by the mathieu equation .",
    "it is shown that at small enough value of @xmath6 the area of the central cell increases with increasing the resonance number , @xmath4 , and increasing the perturbation amplitude , @xmath6 .",
    "the dynamics of the system near the cgs in the near resonance case , when @xmath13 , is considered in sec .",
    "it is shown that in this case at small @xmath6 the classical dynamics near the cgs is stable at any value of the resonance number @xmath4 .",
    "the cases @xmath14 and @xmath15 are considered in detail .",
    "it is shown that the cgs in these two cases becomes unstable at much less values of @xmath6 , than for large @xmath4 ( @xmath16 ... ) .",
    "a stability of the quantum system is considered in sec .",
    "4 . in this case , an additional parameter , a dimensionless planck constant , @xmath5 , influences significantly the behavior of the system .",
    "because the hamiltonian is time - periodic , with the period @xmath17 , we use the floquet theory to study localization properties of quantum system in the region of the qgs . for @xmath18 , and small enough @xmath5 , the quasienergy ( qe ) states can be conventionally divided into the following groups .",
    "the first group includes the qe states which belong to some particular `` resonance cells '' in the hilbert space .",
    "these qe states are well - localized inside a given resonance cell .",
    "the second group includes the delocalized `` separatrix '' qe states which correspond to the classical stochastic web .",
    "usually , these `` separtrix '' qe states are responsible for tunneling effects between different `` resonance cells '' , even for small @xmath6.@xcite    we show that the qgs is stable when the following conditions are satisfied : ( a ) an existence of the qe state mainly localized in the qgs of the harmonic oscillator , ( b ) when @xmath18 and chaos is weak , ( c ) small enough @xmath5 , when one can neglect the tunneling phenomenon . when @xmath5 is larger than the size of the central cell , no qe state localized in the qgs of the harmonic oscillator was found .",
    "we show , that at small enough values of @xmath6 , the stability of the qgs can be improved by choosing the non - resonant frequency of the wave , so that @xmath19 .    for small enough @xmath6 , a stability of the qgs is mainly determined by the structure of the qe state mostly localized at the qgs of the harmonic oscillator ( qgs qe state ) . in the exact resonance case this particular qe state",
    "has a complicated structure .",
    "on the one hand , it is mostly localized on the qgs , but , on the other hand , it has the `` separatrix '' structure@xcite and provides a tunneling from the region of the qgs to other resonance cells . in order to improve stability of the qgs , the separatrix structure should be destroyed by choosing @xmath13 .    in the exact and near resonance cases we study numerically the probability , @xmath20 , for a particle to remain in the qgs , depending on @xmath6 and for different values of @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath9 .",
    "when @xmath7 and @xmath6 is small , the dynamics depends on the value of the quantum parameter , @xmath5 , which controls degree of delocalization of the qgs qe state .",
    "when @xmath5 is small , the probability of tunneling to other cells is small too , and @xmath20 decreases with @xmath6 increasing , because chaos makes the qgs qe state more delocalized . for large enough values of @xmath5 , the dependence of @xmath20 on @xmath6 becomes more complicated because in this case we have two superimposing effects : the influence of chaos on the dynamics , and the effect of tunneling to the classically unacceptable cells .",
    "these two features make the dependence @xmath21 non - monotonic . in the region of small @xmath6",
    ", @xmath20 increases with @xmath6 increasing .",
    "this behavior of @xmath20 can be explained as a result of destroying the delocalized qe states with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "further increase of @xmath6 leads to decreasing @xmath20 .",
    "this behavior of @xmath20 is connected with delocalization of qe states due to increasing of the chaotic component . at large enough values of @xmath6 , the dependence of @xmath20 on @xmath6",
    "becomes more complicated , and generally must be considered using many qe states .",
    "it is shown that the value of @xmath9 influence significantly the stability of the qgs only at small @xmath22 .",
    "the stability of the qgs at @xmath8 and @xmath13 is explored .",
    "it is shown that the qgs becomes unstable at much less values of the wave amplitude than in the case when @xmath4 is large .",

    "20 ( b ) .",
    "another way to increase the stability of the ground state at small @xmath6 , is to destroy the separatrix qe functions by choosing the non - resonant value of the wave frequency , so that @xmath19 . for a non - resonant case ( @xmath240 ) , the plot of the dispersion as a function of time is presented in fig .",

    "one can see from fig 21 ( a ) that introducing a detuning , @xmath13 , results in considerable improvement of the stability of the qgs in comparison with the case of the exact resonance , illustrated in fig .",

    "the minimal value of detuning , @xmath9 , required to destroy the separatrix structure , and to make the ground state more stable , can be estimated from the quantum equations of motions in the resonance approximation ( [ al_eq ] ) .",

    "must , at least , occupy the two separatrices .",

    "makes the qgs more stable . unlike the near resonance case , in the case of the exact resonance ,",
    "a stability of the qgs at @xmath18 is independent of the wave amplitude , because in this case the localization properties of the qgs are defined by the structure of separatrix qe function , which in the resonance approximation ( when @xmath6 is small ) is independent of @xmath6.@xcite one can see from a comparison of fig .",
