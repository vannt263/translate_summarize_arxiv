    "the goal of this paper is to simplify and generalize a part of classical link theory based on various signatures of links ( defined by trotter @xcite murasugi @xcite,@xcite , tristram @xcite , levine @xcite @xcite , smolinsky @xcite , florens @xcite and cimasoni and florens @xcite ) .",
    "this part is known for its relations to topology of 4-dimensional manifolds , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite and applications in topology of real algebraic curves @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    ".    similarity of the signatures to the new invariants @xcite , @xcite , which were defined in the new frameworks of link homology theories and had spectacular applications @xcite , @xcite , @xcite to problems on classical link cobordisms , gives a new reason to revisit the old theory .",
    "there are two ways to introduce the signatures : the original 3-dimensional , via seifert surface and seifert form , and 4-dimensional , via the intersection form of the cyclic coverings of 4-ball branched over surfaces .",
    "i believe , this paper clearly demonstrates advantages of the latter , 4-dimensional approach , which provides more conceptual definitions , easily working in the situations hardly available for the seifert form approach .    in the generalization considered here the classical links",
    "are replaced by collections of transversal to each other oriented submanifolds of codimension two .    technically the work is based on a systematic use of twisted homology and the intersection forms in the twisted homology .",
    "only the simplest kinds of twisted homology is used , the one with coefficients in @xmath0 , see appendix .",
    "a key property of twisted homology , which makes the whole story possible , is the following well - known fact , which i call twisted acyclicity of a circle :    _ twisted homology of a circle with coefficients in @xmath0 and non - trivial monodromy vanishes . _",
    "this implies that the twisted homology of this kind completely ignores parts of the space formed by circles along which the monodromy of the coefficient system is non - trivial ( for precise and detailed formulation see section [ st.2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , twisted acyclicity of a circle implies that the complement of a tubular neighborhood of a link looks like a closed manifold , because the boundary , being fibered to circles , is invisible for the twisted homology .",
    "moreover , the same holds true for a collection of pairwise transversal generically immersed closed manifolds of codimension 2 in arbitrary closed manifold , provided the monodromy around each manifold is non - trivial .",
    "the twisted homology does not feel the intersection of the submanifolds as a singularity .",
    "the complement of a cobordism between such immersed links looks ( again , from the point of view of twisted homology ) like a compact cobordism between closed manifolds .",
    "this , together with classical results about signatures of manifolds and relations between twisted homology and homology with constant coefficients , allows us to deal with a link of codimension two as if it was a single closed manifold .",
    "i can not assume the twisted homology well - known to the reader , and review the material related to it .",
    "of course , the material on non - twisted homology is not reviewed .",
    "the review is limited to a very special twisted homology , the one with complex coefficients .",
    "more general twisted homology is not needed here .",
    "the review is postponed to appendices .",
    "the reader somehow familiar with twisted homology may visit this section when needed .",
    "the experts are invited to look through appendices , too .",
    "we begin in section [ s2 ] with a detailed exposition restricted to the classical links .",
    "section [ s3 ] is devoted to higher dimensional generalization , including motivation for our choice of the objects .",
    "section [ s4 ] is devoted to _ span inequalities _ , that is , restrictions on homology of submanifolds of the ball , which span a given link contained in the boundary of the ball .",
    "section [ s5 ] is devoted to _ slice inequalities _ , which are restrictions on homology of a link with given transversal intersection with a sphere of codimension one .",
    "recall that a classical knot is a smooth simple closed curve in the 3-sphere @xmath1 .",
    "this is how one usually defines classical knots .",
    "however it is not the curve per se that is really considered in the classical knot theory , but rather its placement in @xmath1 .",
    "classical knots incarnate the idea of knottedness : both the curve and @xmath1 are topologically standard , but the position of the curve in @xmath1 may be arbitrarily complicated topologically .",
    "therefore a classical knot is rather a pair @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a smooth submanifold of @xmath1 diffeomorphic to @xmath4 .",
    "a classical link is a pair @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a smooth closed one - dimensional submanifold of @xmath1 . if @xmath6 is connected , then this is a knot .",
    "an exterior of a classical link @xmath5 is the complement of an open tubular neighborhood of @xmath6 .",
    "this is a compact 3-manifold with boundary .",
    "the boundary is the boundary of the tubular neighborhood of @xmath6 .",
    "hence , this is the total space of a locally trivial fibration over @xmath6 with fiber @xmath4 .",
    "an exterior @xmath7 is a deformation retract of the complement @xmath8 .",
    "it s a nice replacement of @xmath8 , because @xmath9 is homeomorphic to @xmath8 , but @xmath7 is compact manifold and has a nice boundary .",
    "if @xmath6 consists of @xmath10 connected components , @xmath11 , then by the alexander duality @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "the group @xmath17 is dual to @xmath18 with respect to the alexander linking pairing @xmath19 .",
    "hence a basis of @xmath18 defines a dual basis in @xmath17 .",
    "an orientation of @xmath6 determines a basis @xmath20 $ ] ,  , @xmath21 $ ] of @xmath18 , and the dual basis of @xmath17 , which is realized by meridians @xmath22 , ",
    ", @xmath23 positively linked to @xmath24 ,  , @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "( the meridians are fibers of a tubular fibration @xmath26 over points chosen on the corresponding components . )    therefore , if @xmath6 is oriented , then a local coefficient system on @xmath7 with fiber @xmath0 is defined by an @xmath10-tuple of complex numbers @xmath27 , the images under the monodromy homomorphism @xmath28 of the generators @xmath29 $ ] ,  , @xmath30 $ ] of @xmath17",
    ".    thus for an oriented classical knot @xmath6 consisting of @xmath10 connected components , local coefficient systems on @xmath7 with fiber @xmath0 are parametrized by @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath32 be a classical link , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 takes to @xmath37 a meridian of @xmath38 positively linked with @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath39 be smooth oriented surfaces transversal to each other with @xmath40 .",
    "extend the tubular neighborhood of @xmath6 involved in the construction of @xmath7 to a collection of tubular neighborhoods @xmath41 , ",
    ", @xmath42 of @xmath43 ,  , @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "without loss of generality we may choose @xmath45 in such a way that they would intersect each other in the simplest way .",
    "namely , each connected component @xmath46 of @xmath47 would contain only one point of @xmath48 and no point of others @xmath49 and would consist of entire fibers of @xmath45 and @xmath50 , so that the fibers define a structure of bi - disk @xmath51 on @xmath46 .    to achieve this",
    ", one has to make the fibers of the tubular fibration @xmath52 at each intersection point of @xmath53 and @xmath54 coinciding with a disk in @xmath54 and then diminish all @xmath45 appropriately .",
    "now let us extend @xmath7 to @xmath55 .",
    "this is a compact 4-manifold .",
    "its boundary contains @xmath7 , the rest of it is a union of pieces of boundaries of @xmath45 with @xmath56 .",
    "these pieces are fibered over the corresponding pieces of @xmath53 with fiber @xmath4 .    by the alexander duality",
    ", the orientation of @xmath53 gives rise to a homomorphism @xmath57 that maps a homology class to its linking number with @xmath53 .",
    "these homomorphisms altogether determine a homomorphism @xmath58 . for any @xmath59 ,",
    "the composition of this homomorphism with the homomorphism @xmath60 is a homomorphism @xmath61 extending @xmath62 .",
    "if each @xmath53 has no closed connected components , then this extension is unique",
    ". let us denote it by @xmath63 .    according to [ st.4.6 ] , in @xmath64 there is a hermitian intersection form .",
    "denote its signature by @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath65 does not depend on @xmath66 .",
    "any @xmath67 with @xmath68 is cobordant to @xmath53 .",

    ", @xmath80 hence , @xmath81 .      in the definition of signature @xmath65 above one",
    "needs to numerate the components @xmath38 of @xmath6 to associate to each of them the corresponding component @xmath37 of @xmath82 , but there is no need to require connectedness of each @xmath38 .",
    "this leads to a notion of colored link .",
    "an _ @xmath10-colored link _ @xmath6 is an oriented link in @xmath1 together with a map ( called _ coloring _ ) assigning to each connected component of @xmath6 a color in @xmath83 .",
    "the sublink @xmath84 is constituted by the components of @xmath6 with color @xmath85 for @xmath56 .    for an @xmath10-colored link @xmath86 and @xmath35 , the signature @xmath87 is defined as above , but each component @xmath88 colored with color @xmath85 is associated to @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath89 for all @xmath90 , then the signature @xmath65 coincides with the murasugi signature @xmath91 introduced in @xcite . if all @xmath37 are roots of unity of a degree , which is a power of a prime number and all linking numbers @xmath92 vanish , then @xmath65 coincides with the signature defined by florens @xcite .    in the most general case ,",
    "@xmath65 coincides with the signature defined for arbitrary @xmath82 by cimasoni and florens @xcite using a 3-dimensional approach , with a version of seifert surface , @xmath93-complex .",
    "there is a spectrum of objects considered as generalizations of classical knots and links .",
    "the closest generalization of classical knots are pairs @xmath94 , where @xmath3 is a smooth submanifold diffeomorphic to @xmath95 .",
    "then the requirements on @xmath3 are weakened .",
    "say , one may require @xmath3 to be only homeomorphic to @xmath95 , not diffeomorphic . or just a homology sphere of dimension @xmath96 .",
    "the codimension is important in order to keep any resemblance to classical knots .    in the same spirit ,",
    "for the closest higher - dimensional counter - part of classical links one takes a pair consisting of @xmath97 and a collection of its disjoint smooth submanifolds diffeomorphic to @xmath95 .",
    "one allows to weaken the restrictions on the submanifolds . up to arbitrary closed submanifolds",
    "i suggest to allow transversal intersections of the submanifolds .",
    "of course , the main excuse for this is that some results can extended to this setup .",
    "here is a couple of other reasons .",
    "first , in the classical dimension , it is easy for submanifolds to be disjoint .",
    "generically curves in 3-sphere are disjoint .",
    "if they intersect , it is a miracle or , rather , has a special cause .",
    "generic submanifolds of codimension two in a manifold of dimension @xmath98 intersect .",
    "if they do not intersect , this is a miracle , or consequence of a special cause .",
    "second , classical links emerge naturally as links of singular points of complex algebraic curves in @xmath99 .",
    "recall that for an algebraic curve @xmath100 and a point @xmath101 the boundary of a sufficiently small ball @xmath46 centered at @xmath102 , the link @xmath103 is well - defined up to diffeomorphism , and it is called the link of @xmath93 at @xmath102 .    an obvious generalization of this definition to an algebraic hypersurface @xmath104 gives rise to a pair @xmath105 with connected @xmath3 .",
    "it can not be a union of _ disjoint _ submanifolds of @xmath106",
    ".    it would not be difficult to extend the results of this paper to a more general setup .",
    "for example , one can replace the ambient sphere with a homology sphere , or even more general manifold .",
    "however , one should stop somewhere .",
    "the author prefers this early point , because the level of generality accepted here suffices for demonstrating the new opportunities open by a systematic usage of twisted homology . on the other hand",
    ", further generalizations can make formulations more cumbersome .      by an _",

    "the differential type of the exterior does not depend on the choice of neighborhoods .",
