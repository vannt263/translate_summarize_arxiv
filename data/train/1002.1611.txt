    "organic semiconductors are envisioned to revolutionize display and lighting technology .",
    "the remaining engineering - related challenges are being tackled and the first products are commercially available already . to guarantee a sustainable market entry , however , it is important to further deepen the understanding of organic semiconductors and organic semiconductor devices .",
    "electronic trap states in organic semiconductors severely affect the performance of such devices . for organic thin - film transistors ( tft s ) , for example , key device parameters such as the effective charge mobility , the threshold voltage , the subthreshold swing as well as the electrical and environmental stability are severely affected by trap states at the interface between the gate dielectric and the semiconductor .",
    "trap states in organic semiconductors have been studied for several decades.@xcite although the first organic field - effect transistors emerged in the 1980 s , ( polymeric semiconductors : ref .  , small molecule organic semiconductors : ref .  )",
    "it is only recently , that trap states in organic field - effect transistors are a subject of intense scientific investigation ( refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the present study is focused on trap densities in small molecule organic semiconductors .",
    "these solids consist of molecules with loosely bound @xmath2-electrons .",
    "the @xmath2-electrons are transferred from molecule to molecule and , therefore , are the source of charge conduction .",
    "small molecule organic semiconductors tend to be crystalline and can be obtained in high purity .",
    "typical materials are oligomers such as pentacene , tetracene or sexithiophene but this class of materials also includes e.g. rubrene , c@xmath3 or the soluble material tips pentacene ( ref .  ) . trap densities are often given as a volume density thus averaging over various trapping depths .",
    "the spectral density of localized states in the band gap , i.e. the trap densities as a function of energy ( trap dos ) , gives a much deeper insight into the charge transport and device performance . in this paper",
    "we compare , for the first time , the trap dos in various samples of small molecule organic semiconductors including thin - film transistors ( tft s ) where the active layer generally is polycrstalline and organic single crystal field - effect transistors ( sc - fet s ) .",
    "these data are also compared with the trap dos in the bulk of single crystals made of small molecule semiconductors .",
    "it turns out that it is this comparison of trap densities in tft s , sc - fet s and in the bulk of single crystals that is particularly rewarding .",
    "the trap dos in organic semiconductors can be derived from several different experimental techniques , including measurements of field - effect transistors , space - charge - limited current ( sclc ) measurements , thermally stimulated currents ( tsc ) , kelvin - probe , time - of - flight ( tof ) or capacitance measurements .",
    "for the present study , we focus on the trap dos as derived from electrical characteristics of organic field - effect transistors or from sclc measurements of single crystals .",
    "we begin with a brief discussion of charge transport in small molecule semiconductors followed by a summary of the current view of the origin of trap states in these materials . after a comparison of different methods to calculate the trap dos from electrical characteristics of organic field - effect transistors we are eventually in a position to compile , compare and",
    "discuss trap dos data .",
    "even in ultrapure single crystals made of small molecule semiconductors , the charge transport mechanism is still controversial .",
    "the measured mobility in ultrapure crystals increases as the temperature is decreased according to a power law @xmath4.@xcite this trend alone would be consistent with band transport .",
    "however , the mobilities @xmath5 at room temperature are only around 1@xmath6/vs and the estimated mean free path thus is comparable to the lattice constants . it has often been noticed that this is inconsistent with band transport.@xcite    since the molecules in the crystal have highly polarizable @xmath2-orbitals , polarization effects are not negligible in a suitable description of charge transport in organic semiconductors . _",
    "holstein s _ polaron band model considers electron - electron interactions and the model has recently been extended.@xcite with increasing temperature , the polaron mass increases .",
    "this effect is accompanied by a bandwidth narrowing and inevitably results in a localization of the charge carrier .",
    "consequently , this model predicts a transition from band transport at low temperature to phonon - assisted hopping transport at higher temperatures ( e.g. room temperature ) .",
    "the model may explain the experimentally observed increase in mobility with decreasing temperature and seems to be consistent with the magnitude of the measured mobilities at room temperature .",
    "on the other hand , thermal motion of the weakly bound molecules in the solid is large compared to inorganic crystals .",
    "such thermal motions most likely affect the intermolecular transfer integral .",
    "troisi et al .",
    "_ have shown that , at least for temperatures above 100k , the fluctuation of the intermolecular transfer integral is of the same order of magnitude as the transfer integral itself in materials such as pentacene , anthracene or rubrene.@xcite as a consequence , the fluctuations do not only introduce a small correction , but determine the transport mechanism and limit the charge carrier mobility.@xcite clearly , the thermal fluctuations are less severe at a reduced temperature and the calculations predict a mobility that increases with decreasing temperature , according to a power law .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the measured temperature - dependence in ultrapure crystals .",
    "moreover , the model predicts mobilities at room temperature between 0.1@xmath6/vs and 50@xmath6/vs , which also is in good agreement with experiment.@xcite interestingly , the importance of thermal disorder is supported by recent tetrahertz transient conductivity measurements on pentacene crystals.@xcite    in essence , the band broadening due to the thermal motion of the molecules is expected to result in electronic trap states which would be related to the intrinsic nature of small molecule semiconductors.@xcite clearly , trap states can also be due to extrinsic defects and these traps can completely dominate the charge transport resulting in an effective mobility @xmath7.@xcite for amorphous inorganic semiconductors such as amorphous silicon , the mobility edge picture has been developed ( fig .  [ figure - dossketch]).@xcite the mobility edge separates extended from localized states .",
    "the existence of extended states in amorphous silicon is attributed to the similarity of the short - range configuration of the atoms in the amorphous phase which is similar to the configuration in the crystalline phase.@xcite hopping in localized states is expected to be negligible if transport in extended states exists , i.e. we have an abrupt increase in mobility at the mobility edge .",
    "only the charge carriers that are thermally activated to states above the mobility edge contribute to the transport of charge .",
    "schematic representation of the mobility edge separating localized states ( traps ) from extended states . at the mobility edge , the mobility as a function of energy abruptly rises and only the charge carriers that are thermally activated to states above the mobility edge contribute to the charge transport . ]    in the following we assume that charge transport in small molecule semiconductors can be described by an effective transport level and a distribution of trap states below this transport level .",
    "the mobility edge model is a specific realization of this very general assumption . in",
    "a _ completely _ disordered material ( no short - range order ) all electronic states are localized.@xcite the charge carriers are highly localized and hop from one molecule to the next . however",
    ", even this situation can be described by introducing an effective transport level and a broad distribution of trap states below the transport level.@xcite in the following , we use the term valence band edge .",
    "this term may generally be interpreted as the effective transport level and denotes the mobility edge in the mobility edge picture .",
    "we proceed by summarizing the current view of the microscopic origin of traps in small molecule semiconductors .",
    "charge carrier traps within the semiconductor are caused by structural defects or chemical impurities .",
    "chemical impurities may also cause a surrounding of structural defects by distorting the host lattice.@xcite on the other hand , chemical impurities tend to accumulate in regions with increased structural disorder ( ref .  ) as well as at the surface of a crystal ( ref .  ) .",
    "trap states caused by the gate dielectric can become very important in organic field - effect transistors .",
    "finally , as mentioned already , also the thermal fluctuations of the molecules are expected to result in shallow trap states within the band gap .      in the bulk of ultrapure anthracene or naphthalene crystals , typical densities of vacancies ( a dominant point defect )",
    "are of the order of @xmath8@xmath9 ( ref .",
    "@xcite , p.  222 ) .",
    "vacancies are expected to be concentrated close to other structural defects due to a reduced formation energy.@xcite extended structural defects ( e.g. edge dislocations , screw dislocations or low - angle grain boundaries ) can be present in significant densities in organic crystals , e.g. 10@xmath10@xmath9 ( ref .",
    "@xcite , p.226 ) .",
    "therefore , extended structural defects are thought to be the main source of traps in ultrapure organic crystals.@xcite    thin films of small molecule semiconductors are expected to have a higher density of structural defects than single crystals .",
    "thin films of small molecule semiconductors are often polycrystalline and grain boundaries can limit the charge transport in such films . for example , measurements of sexithiophene - based transistors with sio@xmath11 gate dielectric and an active channel consisting of only two grains and one grain boundary show , that the transport is in fact limited by the grain boundary.@xcite at the grain boundary , a high density of traps exists and the density of these traps per unit area of the active accumulation layer is of the order of @xmath12@xmath13.@xcite in the following , we focus on structural defects in vacuum evaporated pentacene films which are of particular relevance for this work .",
    "since pentacene films are often polycrystalline , large angle grain boundaries are expected to produce additional structural defects also in this material .",
    "the effect of grain boundaries on charge transport in pentacene films is still controversial .",
    "atomic force measurements ( afm ) of ultrathin pentacene films have clearly shown , that the field - effect mobility in pentacene - based transistors can be higher in films with smaller grains.@xcite in addition , some experimental evidence indicates that there is no correlation between charge trapping and topographical features in pentacene thin films.@xcite on the contrary , it has recently been shown that long - lived ( energetically deep ) traps that cause gate bias stress effects in pentacene - based tft s are mainly concentrated at grain boundaries.@xcite another important cause of structural disorder in pentacene films is polymorphism since pentacene can crystallize in at least four different structures ( phases ) .",
    "it is quite common that at least two of these phases coexist in pentacene thin films.@xcite    a theoretically study deals with in - grain defects in vacuum evaporated pentacene films.@xcite structural defects are formed during the film growth .",
    "upon addition of more and more `` defective '' molecules at a given site , the ideal crystal structure becomes energetically more and more favourable .",
    "the system eventually relaxes into the ideal crystal structure during the continuation of the film growth .",
    "the relaxation happens , provided that the evaporation rate is low enough and that there is enough time for relaxation.@xcite in this study it is suggested that structural defects within the grains of a pentacene film that resist relaxation can not exceed densities of 10@xmath14@xmath9 , at typical growth conditions .",
    "a structural defect can , however , influence the electronic levels of 10 surrounding molecules even if these molecules are in the perfect crystal configuration .",
    "it is concluded that grain boundaries ( and not in - grain defects ) are the most prominent cause of structural defects in pentacene thin films.@xcite    on the other hand , an experimental study identifies pentacene molecules that are displaced slightly out of the molecular layers that make up the crystals.@xcite by means of high impedance scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , specific defect islands were detected in pentacene films with monolayer coverage . within the defect islands ,",
    "the pentacene molecules are displaced up to 2.5 along the long molecular axis out of the pentacene layer with a broad distribution in the magnitude of the displacements .",
    "electronic structural calculations show that the displaced molecules lead to traps for both electrons and holes .",
    "the maximum displacement of the pentacene molecules as seen by stm is 2.5 and this corresponds to a maximum trap depth of 0.1ev.@xcite      the best method to produce crystals of small molecule semiconductors includes a zone refinement step in the purification procedure ( ref .",
    "@xcite , p.  224 ) .",
    "even such crystals still have a considerable impurity content .",
    "anthracene , for example , still has an impurity content of 0.1ppm in the best crystals , which corresponds to a volume density of @xmath15@xmath9 ( ref .",
    "@xcite , p.  224 ) .",
    "zone refinement produces organic materials of much higher purity as compared to purification by sublimation.@xcite however , zone refinement can only be applied if the material can be molten without a chemical reaction or a decomposition to occur .",
    "this is not possible for many materials including tetracene or pentacene .",
    "thus , much higher impurity concentrations are expected e.g. in tetracene or pentacene.@xcite an experimental study indicates that in tetracene single crystals the charge carrier mobility is limited by chemical impurities rather than by structural defects.@xcite    the ability of a chemical impurity to act as trap depends on its accessible energy levels . in a simplistic view a hole trap forms if the ionization energy of the impurity is smaller than the ionization energy of the host material.@xcite we focus on pentacene , and the center ring of the pentacene molecule is expected to be the most reactive.@xcite an important impurity is thus thought to be the oxidized pentacene species 6,13-pentacenequinone , where two oxygen atoms form double bonds with the carbon atoms at the 6,13-positions . according to theoretical studies , pentacenequinone is expected to lead to states in the band gap of pentacene ( ref .   and ) and may predominantly act as scattering center ( ref .  ) .",
    "repeated purification of pentacene by sublimation can result in very high mobilities in pentacene single crystals.@xcite another common impurity in pentacene is thought to be 6,13-dihydropentacene , where additional hydrogen atoms are bound both at the 6- and at the 13-position.@xcite      properties of the gate dielectric s surface such as surface roughness , surface free energy and the presence of heterogenous nucleation sites are expected to play a key role in the growth of small molecule semiconductor films from the vapour phase thus influencing the quality of the films . apart from growth - related effects , the sole presence of the gate dielectric can influence the charge transport in a field - effect transistor especially because the charge is transported in the first few molecular layers within the semiconductor at the interface between the gate dielectric and the semiconductor .",
    "thus , also fet s based on single crystals are affected , even laminated ( flip - crystal - type ) sc - fet s .      the surface of the gate dielectric contains chemical groups that act as charge carrier traps .",
    "the trapping mechanism may be as simple as the one discussed above for chemical impurities .",
    "this means that the trapping depends on the specific surface chemistry of the gate dielectric but the ability of certain chemical groups on the surface of the gate dielectric to cause traps will also depend on the nature of the small molecule semiconductor .",
    "the trapping mechanism can also be seen as a reversible or irreversible electrochemical reaction driven by the application of a gate voltage.@xcite chemical groups on the surface of the gate dielectric certainly affect the transport of electrons in n - type field - effect transistors.@xcite      water adsorbed on the gate dielectric may dissociate and react with pentacene .",
    "one possible reaction product is 6,13-dihydropentacene .",
    "the number of impurities that are formed can depend on the electrochemical potential and would thus increase as the gate voltage is ramped up in a field - effect transistor.@xcite    it has also been suggested that water causes traps by reacting with the surface of the gate dielectric .",
    "water on a sio@xmath11 gate dielectric with a large number of silanol groups ( -si - oh ) causes the formation of sio@xmath16-groups and the latter groups can act as hole traps.@xcite    in addition to chemical reactions involving water , water molecules may act as traps themselves just like any other chemical impurity .",
    "a polar impurity molecule leads to an electric field dependent trap depth though.@xcite    even if a polar impurity does not lead to a positive trap depth , its dipole moment modifies the local value of the polarization energy since we have highly polarizable @xmath2-orbitals in organic semiconductors .",
    "this results in traps in the vicinity of the water molecules.@xcite the net effect is a significant broadening of the trap dos at the insulator - semiconductor interface.@xcite      it has been suggested that the polarity of the gate dielectric surface impedes the charge transport as described in the following.@xcite a more polar surface has randomly oriented dipoles which lead to a modification of the local polarization energy within the semiconductor and thus to a change of the site energies . as in the case of polar water molecules , this brings a broadening of the trap dos .",
    "the dependence of the mobility on the dielectric constant of the gate dielectric has been observed with conjugated polymers ( refs .   and ) and with rubrene single crystal field - effect transistors.@xcite more recently , a model has been put forward to quantitatively study the effect of randomly oriented static dipole moments within the gate dielectric.@xcite the model predicts a significant broadening of the trap dos within the first 1 nm at the insulator - semiconductor interface and can explain the dependence of the mobility on the dielectric constant of the gate dielectric quantitatively.@xcite in this context , it is important to realize that surfaces with a low polarity have a low surface free energy and are thus expected to have a high water repellency as well .",
    "clearly , the high water repellency leads to a a reduced amount of water at the critical insulator - semiconductor interface.@xcite      as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ section - chargetransport ] , the thermal fluctuations of the intermolecular transfer integral may be of the same order of magnitude as the transfer integral itself in small molecule semiconductors such as pentacene , anthracene or rubrene.@xcite a theoretical study has pointed out that the large fluctuations in the transfer integral result in a tail of trap states extending from the valence band edge into the gap.@xcite moreover , the band tail is temperature - dependent .",
    "the extension of the band tail increases with temperature due to an increase in the thermal motion of the molecules.@xcite for pentacene the theoretical study predicts exponential band tails @xmath17 with @xmath18mev at @xmath19k and @xmath20mev at @xmath21k .",
    "some experimental evidence suggests , that trap states due to the thermal motion of the molecules play a role in samples with a low trap density.@xcite",
    "field - effect transistors are often used to measure the trap dos .",
    "the trap dos can be calculated from the measured transfer characteristics with various analytical methods or by simulating the transistor characteristics with a suitable computer program . in sec .",
    "[ section - comparison ] we quantitatively compare the trap dos from various studies in the literature with our data .",
    "since in these studies different methods were used to derive the trap dos , it is necessary to ensure that all these methods lead to comparable results .",

    "the single crystals for the sc - fet s and for the measurements of the bulk trap dos were grown by physical vapour transport ( sublimation and recrystallization in a stream of an inert carrier gas).@xcite moreover , the electron trap dos close to the conduction band edge ( cb ) has rarely been studied so far in small molecule semiconductors and , with one exception , we are dealing with the hole trap dos in small molecule semiconductors in the following .",

    ": h , the mobility edge picture is used to describe the charge transport and trap states have been studied extensively.@xcite the distribution of bond angles and interatomic distances in amorphous silicon ( a - si ) around a mean value leads to a blurred band edge , i.e. to band tails extending into the gap .",
    "the trap densities at a given energy reflect the volume density of certain bond angles and interatomic distances .",
    "for example , a rather large deviation from the atomic configuration in the crystalline phase ( from the mean value in the amorphous phase ) leads to traps with energies far from the band edge .",
    "these traps are present with rather low densities since small deviations are much more likely to occur .",
    "in addition , we may have dangling bonds in a - si acting as traps .",
    "it is well known , that hydrogenation of a - si leads to a reduction in the trap dos due to a passivation of dangling bonds with hydrogen.@xcite    for fig .  [ figure - asi ] we have selected typical trap dos data from samples with small molecule semiconductors ( data from fig .  [ figure - together ] ) .",

    "we similarly compare data from small molecule semiconductors with a typical hole trap dos in poly - si ( dash - dotted blue line ) and an electron trap dos in poly - si ( full blue line ) .",
    "the trap distribution is less steep in poly - si as compared to the trap dos in organic thin films such that we have higher trap densities far from the transport band edge .",
    "we compared the hole trap dos ( trap densities as a function of energy relative to the valence band edge ) in various samples of small molecule organic semiconductors as derived from electrical characteristics of organic field - effect transistors and space - charge - limited current measurements .",
    "in particular , we distinguish between the trap dos in thin - film transistors with vacuum - evaporated small molecules , the trap dos in organic single crystal field - effect transistors and the trap dos in the bulk of single crystals grown by physical vapour transport .",
    "a comparison of all data strongly suggests that structural defects at grain boundaries tend to be the main cause of `` fast '' traps in tft s made with vacuum - evaporated pentacene and supposedly also in related materials .",

    "the trap dos in tft s with small molecule semiconductors is very similar to the trap dos in hydrogenated amorphous silicon .",
    "this is surprising due to the very different nature of polycrystalline thin films made of small molecule semiconductors with van der waals - type interaction on the one hand and covalently bound amorphous silicon on the other hand .",
