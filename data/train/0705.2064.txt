    "in 1982 , the european muon collaboration ( emc ) at cern found that the structure function ratio of bound nucleon to free nucleon , in the form of @xmath11 , is not consistent with the expectation by assuming that a nuclei is composed by almost free nucleons with fermi motion correction taken into account  @xcite , and such phenomenon was confirmed by e139 collaboration at slac  @xcite .",
    "this discovery , which is called the nuclear emc effect , has received extensive attention by the nuclear and hadronic physics society .",
    "many nuclear models , such as the pion excess model  @xcite , the quark cluster model  @xcite and the rescaling model  @xcite _ et al .",
    "_ , have been proposed to explain the data , and all these models can qualitatively describe the data in the mediate @xmath0 region .",
    "the inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) data are expressed as @xmath12 , which can be written in the naive parton model as : @xmath13}}{\\sigma_i{e_i^2\\left[q_i(x , q^2)+\\bar{q}_i(x , q^2)\\right]}},\\ ] ] where @xmath14 denotes the charge of the partons with flavor @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the parton distribution function of a nucleon .",
    "[ f2 ] shows the @xmath17 results of the cluster model , the pion excess model and the rescaling model respectively at @xmath18  gev@xmath19 in the mediate @xmath0 region .",
    "all these models , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , predict similar behavior of @xmath17 at mediate @xmath0 region .",
    "however , the sea quark of the nuclei is differently described by the three models . in the cluster model ,",
    "all sea quarks are enhanced . in the pion excess model , the sea quarks @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "are enhanced while the other quarks are reduced .",
    "however , in the rescaling model , all sea quarks are reduced in the nuclei compared with those in the free nucleon ( fig .",
    "[ sea ] ) .",
    "the fermilab experiment 772  @xcite measured the dimuon yield in drell - yan process induced by 800  gev proton off various nucleus and compared the data with the theoretical predictions of the three models accounting for the emc effect  @xcite .",
    "the data were explained in ref .",
    "@xcite to favor a conclusion that the sea quark in the nuclei is not enhanced , by neglecting the energy loss effect of the incident quark , which is not precisely determined yet  @xcite . to avoid the uncertainties concerning the sea quarks in the nuclei by the dimuon yield in drell - yan process solely",
    ", the sea content can be also measured in other experiments .",
    "the purpose of this work is to show that the semi - inclusive hadron productions in charged lepton deep inelastic scattering are sensitive to the sea quark content of the nuclei .",
    "the pion , kaon , proton and antiproton productions in the charged lepton semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering off nuclei have been checked by the hermes collaboration  @xcite . however , while the hermes data , which are expressed as multiplicity ratios and also with @xmath22-dependence , are convenient to study the modification of the fragmentation functions in nuclear environment  @xcite , they are not ideal to provide much information about the sea quarks of the nuclei .",
    "we will show that the @xmath23 production , especially the @xmath0 dependent behavior , is ideal to distinguish between different predictions on the sea content of the nuclei in the different models of the emc effect .",
    "the semi - inclusive hadron productions in charged lepton deep inelastic scattering can be related with the quark distribution functions as : @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the parton distribution for quarks with flavor @xmath15 , and @xmath26 is the fragmentation function of quark @xmath27 to hadron @xmath28 .",
    "the formula is also applicable to the nuclei , with the parton distributions and fragmentation functions replaced by @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "the inclusive production itself can not offer enough information about the sea quark enhancement , while the ratio @xmath31 is useful to reveal the difference between the sea quark behavior in the nuclei and that in the nucleon .    in the following",
    ", we will consider the ratios @xmath32 for various hadrons .",
    "we use the pion excess model , the rescaling model and the pion excess model to calculate the sea quark content of the nuclei . for the sea quark distributions in the deuteron d",
    ", we use the result offered by the model itself  @xcite for the cluster model , and for the other two models we adopt the cteq5l parametrization  @xcite of parton distributions for free nucleons by considering the isospin symmetry between proton and neutron .    in the pion excess model ,",
    "the quark distribution in the nuclei is modified by the extra pions caused by the interaction between the nucleons in nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the quark distribution of nuclei is : @xmath33 in which @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the parton distributions in the free pion and in the free nucleon respectively , and @xmath36 is the probability to find extra pions in the nuclei  @xcite . for simplicity , we adopt the parametrization in a toy model  @xcite , in which the proton is supposed to be partially in the nucleon - pion subsystem state and the parton distributions in the nucleon and in the pion are assumed to be the same as those in the free nucleon and in the free pion .",
    "thus , the excess pion and the nucleon probabilities per nucleon are given as  @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the cteq5l  @xcite parametrization of the parton distribution of the nucleon and mrs  @xcite parametrization of the parton distribution of the pion are adopted to obtain @xmath41 and the parton distribution of the nuclei .    in the quark cluster model , six or more quark cluster",
    "is supposed to exist in the nuclei to account for the emc effect . for the sake of simplicity , only six",
    "quark cluster is considered here .",
    "@xmath42 in a six - quark cluster can not be measured directly from experiment , but carlson and havens  @xcite estimated quark distribution q(x ) per nucleon in the six quark cluster based on qcd counting rules : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the coefficients to warrant momentum conservation and the quark number . in the six quark cluster , @xmath0 , the variable defined by @xmath46 , equals to @xmath47 because @xmath22 is defined by @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be given as : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the probability to find the six - quark cluster in the nuclei and is adjusted to fit the inclusive deep inelastic @xmath53-@xmath54 scattering data .",
    "its value is given as 0.30 by carlson and havens  @xcite .",
    "for the rescaling model , the quark in the nuclear medium is considered to have different confinement size compared with that of the quark in the free nucleon .",
    "@xmath55 is related with @xmath56  ( the parton distribution in the free nucleon ) by the relation : @xmath57 where @xmath58 varies with @xmath54 and @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 equals to @xmath61  @xcite while @xmath18  gev@xmath19 and a=56  ( fe ) . for @xmath56 , the parton distribution per nucleon ,",
    "cteq5l parametrization  @xcite is adopted .",
    "given the above analysis , @xmath11 and sea quark enhancement are checked in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] and fig .",
    "due to the non - perturbative nature of the fragmentation process , the fragmentation function can not be calculated from first principle , thus models are used to obtain the fragmentation function .",
    "experimentally , the process of @xmath62 can offer much information about the fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "based on the experimental data and theoretical analysis , kretzer  @xcite gave a parametrization of the fragmentation in the form : @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the constants chosen to fit the experimental data .",
    "for specified hadron , @xmath65 , which determines the low @xmath22 region behavior of the fragmentation function , is the same for all light flavor quarks while @xmath66 , related with the high @xmath22 region behavior of the fragmentation function , is different for various quarks .",
    "therefore , in low @xmath22 region , all quark fragmentation functions have the same shape , and in the large @xmath22 region , the favored quark fragmentation function is larger than the unfavored quark fragmentation function .",
    "in addition , because of the strange dominance at large @xmath0 for @xmath67 in @xmath4 , the fragmentation function such as @xmath68 is larger than that of @xmath69 .    as for @xmath70",
    ", there exists a phenomenological parametrization  @xcite of their fragmentation functions based on the assumption that the fragmentation function of quark @xmath71 to hadron @xmath28 is proportional to the @xmath71 quark distribution in the hadron @xmath28 : @xmath72 in general , the fragmentation functions can be written as : @xmath73 where @xmath74 means unfavored fragmentation function .",
    "there are three options for the favored and unfavored quark fragmentations : ( 1 ) . @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 ; ( 2 ) . @xmath75 and @xmath78 for @xmath79 ; ( 3 ) . @xmath75 and @xmath80 for @xmath81",
    "the parton distributions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are essential to get the fragmentation functions of quark to @xmath5 and @xmath6 . based on the fact that there is no direct parton distribution of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , su(3 ) symmetry between the proton and the @xmath5",
    "is adopted to get the parton distribution in @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "although there are three models , su(3 ) symmetry model , quark - diquark model and pqcd based analysis , the difference of the fragmentation functions will not affect the qualitative predictions by the fact that only the flavor structure of the parton distributions of the proton are different in the three models in the high @xmath0 region  @xcite .",
    "the common feature of the above parameterizations of fragmentation functions is that the favored quark fragmentation is larger than the unfavored quark fragmentation in the large @xmath22 region .",
    "thus the favored quark fragmentation process is able to obtain sea quark information of the nuclei if the produced hadron is from the favored fragmentation of sea quarks in the nuclei .",
    "then the hadron events of produced particles in the large @xmath22 region can be chosen to get the @xmath0 dependence of the production ratio , in which the unfavored fragmentation contribution from the valence quark can be largely suppressed .",
    "fragmentation function in the nuclei is important for producing the hadron production from the nuclei .",
    "hermes collaboration has measured the hadron production from the nuclei and found that the production is reduced compared with that from the free nucleon  @xcite , and many effects such as nuclear absorption  @xcite , parton energy loss  @xcite , gluon bremsstrahlung  @xcite and partial deconfinement  @xcite have been developed to account for the data . in this paper , the parton energy loss model is adopted to get the fragmentation function in the nuclei .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the modification of the fragmentation function is caused by the interaction between the hard quark and the debris of the nuclei .",
    "given that the original parton energy loss model is complicated to apply in the real process , an effective model suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite is used in ref .",
    "@xcite to get the modification of the fragmentation function . in effective parton energy loss model ,",
    "modified fragmentation function is expressed in the form : @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 is the measured hadron energy and @xmath85 is the energy loss of the hard quark going through the nuclei .",
    "@xmath86 is the rescaled momentum fraction caused by the quark energy shift in presence of qcd medium : @xmath87 @xmath88 , the probability for a quark with energy @xmath89 to lose energy @xmath85 , is parameterized by arleo  @xcite : @xmath90,\\ ] ] where @xmath91 , @xmath92 are two parameters with @xmath93 and @xmath94 , as the energy of the quark , which has absorbed the virtual photon , is much higher than the energy loss when it passes through the nuclei environment .",
    "and @xmath95 is the relevant scale of the typical gluon energy and denotes the energy loss scale of the hard quark , @xmath96 although @xmath97 is not precisely determined yet , in the next section we will show that the result is not sensitive on @xmath97 when @xmath59 is large enough . here",
    "we set @xmath98 and @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the nuclear radius  @xcite . from another point of view",
    ", the modification of the fragmentation function in the parton energy loss model is from assumption .",
    "its conformation with the theoretical framework of factorization and renormalization is not fully justified , as the definition of the fragmentation functions are vacuum matrix elements with no relation to the target material .",
    "as we will find , the qualitative conclusion of our paper on the ratio @xmath9 will not be influenced by including the modification of the fragmentation function in the nuclear environment . in order",
    "to get rid of the nuclear absorption or the energy loss process , it would be fine to consider hadron production at larger energy ( say larger than 20  gev ) , hence at higher virtuality , where we know from the present hermes data that these two effects prove negligible .",
    "fig .  [ pion ] and fig .  [ kplus ]",
    "present the results of @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "they show that there is no large difference between various model predictions in the large @xmath22 region and in the low @xmath22 region , no matter by including the favored quark fragmentation process only or by including all favored and unfavored fragmentation processes .",
    "the reason is that @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath3 are contributed mainly by the favored fragmentation processes @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 because that the valence quarks @xmath106 and @xmath107 are predominant over the sea quarks in the mediate @xmath0 region and that production of those hadrons are dominated by the behavior of the valence quark in the nuclei ( fig .",
    "[ uv ] ) .",
    "when focused on @xmath4 , the result with only favored quark fragmentation functions is different from that when all fragmentation processes are considered ( fig .",
    "[ kminus ] ) , which indicates that the unfavored quark fragmentation function , @xmath106 and @xmath107 to @xmath4 , can not be neglected both at low and high @xmath22 region for the predominance of the valence quarks in the @xmath0 region we considered . in the high @xmath22 region , due to parton energy loss",
    ", the @xmath4 is largely suppressed and we can hardly see any difference in the three model predictions with all fragmentation processes being considered .",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 production ratios in different @xmath22 regions are examined and the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ lambda ] and fig .",
    "[ lambdabar ] . for the same reason as @xmath3 ,",
    "three models predict almost the same @xmath0-dependence of @xmath108 . from fig .",
    "[ lambdabar ] , difference are generated among various model predictions on the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath109 , and the these difference are not sensitive to the three options of the fragmentation functions  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the dominant production of @xmath6 is through the favored fragmentation of anti - quarks inside the targets , so that the @xmath0-dependence of the production ratio is sensitive to the sea quark behaviors of the nuclei .",
    "but in the large @xmath22 region , due to the parton energy loss effect , the large difference between three models do not manifest themselves significantly as expected .",
    "the reason is , at large @xmath22 region , the fragmentation function is largely modified by the parton energy loss . and such a phenomenon also happens on @xmath108 .",
    "[ lambdabar ] shows that @xmath109 is not an ideal variable to figure out the nuclear sea quark content by including the modification of the fragmentation function in the nuclear environment .",
    "fortunately , largely difference between three models appears for the quantity @xmath9 , which is more accessible in experiment than @xmath109 . when the integral upper limit is fixed with unity and the lower limit varies from 0.4 to 0.7 , @xmath9 is still model dependent ( fig .  [ ratio ] ) .",
    "thus it is plausible to conclude that @xmath9 can offer information about the sea content of the nuclei .",
    "similar to @xmath110 , the antiproton and proton production ratio @xmath111 can not offer much information while @xmath112 do generate large difference with different nuclear model  ( figs .",
    "[ antiproton]-[ratiop ] ) .",
    "so , the ratio @xmath10 is another choice to check the sea content of the nuclei in experiment .",
    "attention should be paid to extract possible background contribution as a large number of protons and antiprotons might be produced from the decays of other baryons .",
    "@xmath97 is a sensitive parameter that could largely affect the modification of fragmentation function and is not determined clearly yet .",
    "we also calculate @xmath113 , @xmath109 and @xmath9 when @xmath114 ( figs .",
    "[ lambda25]-[ratio25 ] ) . from the figures",
    "we can conclude that @xmath113 and @xmath109 are largely affected by different @xmath97 , while @xmath9 is almost @xmath97 independent . and",
    "@xmath10 also has such properties(figs .",
    "[ antiproton25]-[ratiop ] ) .",
    "so , the ratio @xmath9 and @xmath10 are not sensitive to @xmath97 .    besides",
    ", we should mention that the fixed order calculation used here is not appropriate to describe hadron production at high @xmath22 where large logarithms need to be resumed .",
    "therefore we should consider the results here as qualitative predictions rather than quantitative ones .",
    "for more convinced quantitative predictions , we would need better constrained fits of the nuclear parton distributions , rather than the earlier emc model results adopted in this paper .",
    "in this paper , we adopted three models of the nuclear emc effect : the cluster model , the rescaling model and the pion excess model , to calculate their predictions on the hadron production ratio in charged lepton semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering off nuclei in the large @xmath22 region .",
    "our purpose is to find hadrons which are produced mainly from the sea quarks of nucleus , so that we can distinguish between different predictions on the sea content of the nuclei . for completeness , we considered the production ratios of @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath113 , @xmath109,@xmath9 , @xmath10 and found that the ratios of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are ideal to figure out the sea content of the nuclei .",
    "more significantly , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are accessible in experiment and the behaviors of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are different for different models . according to fig .",
    "[ ratio ] and fig .",
    "[ ratiop ] , we conclude that the various models about the emc effect with different sea behaviors can be distinguished by the future data of the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath9 and @xmath10 in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering process .",
    "the difference between the pion excess model and cluster model is not good enough to be checked out in experiment , but whether the sea quark is enhanced or not is clear to be distinguished according to the result .",
