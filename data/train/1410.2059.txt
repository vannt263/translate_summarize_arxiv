    "thermodynamic properties of yukawa systems ( particles interacting via yukawa or debye - hckel pair potential ) are of considerable interest , in particular in the context of physics of plasmas , dusty ( complex ) plasmas , and colloidal dispersions . an idealized model dealing with point - like charges",
    "immersed in a neutralizing medium , which is responsible for the exponential screening of the interaction potential , has been extensively investigated using various simulation and analytical techniques .",
    "very accurate results for the thermodynamic functions of this model obtained from monte - carlo ( mc ) and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations  @xcite and integral equation theories  @xcite are available in the literature .",
    "the idealized model of yukawa systems disregards some important properties of real substances .",
    "some of these properties , which are particularly relevant to dusty plasmas ( and to some extent also to colloids ) are as follows :  @xcite particles are not point - like , the typical ratio of the particle size to the plasma screening length can vary in a relatively wide range ; there is a wide region around the particles where the ion - particle interaction is very strong , which results in non - linear screening ; plasma electrons and ions are continuously deposited on the particle surface , which results in considerable deviations from the equilibrium ( boltzmann ) distribution of these plasma species ; particle charge is not fixed , but depends on various system parameters ( e.g. on the density of the particles themselves ) ; the average density of ions and electrons is not fixed , but is related to the particle density and charge via the quasineutrality condition .",
    "all this complicates direct application of existing results to practical situations .",
    "more realistic models to represent real dusty plasmas under various conditions are required .",
    "one of the possible strategies towards such models is to construct simple analytical approximations for the `` basic '' case , corresponding to the idealization discussed above .",
    "this can then serve as the basis of more realistic models , allowing an easy evaluation of the relative importance of specific dusty plasma properties in each concrete situation .",
    "existing accurate results for an idealized yukawa model can be considered as reference data in constructing such simple analytical approximations .",
    "this point of view has been shared in a previous publication ,  @xcite where the debye - hckel plus hole ( dhh ) approximation has been applied to yukawa systems .",
    "the dhh approach has been originally proposed to reduce inaccuracy of the conventional debye - hckel ( dh ) theory when evaluating thermodynamic properties of non - ideal one - component - plasma ( ocp ) .",
    "@xcite the main idea behind the dhh approximation is that the exponential particle density must be truncated close to a test particle so as not to become negative upon linearization . when applied to yukawa systems , dhh demonstrates considerable improvement over the traditional dh theory in the regime covering the transition between weak and moderate coupling ( in the limit of weak coupling dhh reduces to dh ) .",
    "it even allows to roughly reproduce the thermodynamics of strongly coupled yukawa systems up to the fluid - solid phase transition , but the agreement with available results from numerical experiments is not better than qualitative in this regime .  @xcite    the purpose of the present paper is to discuss another simple model , which is particularly suitable for the regime of strong coupling .",
    "this is the so - called ion sphere model ( ism ) , which is known to describe rather precisely the internal energy of the ocp in the limit of strong coupling .",
    "@xcite we show that ism allows to obtain simple expressions for the internal energy , pressure , and compressibility of yukawa systems .",
    "these expressions are compared with the `` exact '' reference data from md simulations .",
    "@xcite good agreement is found in the regime of strong coupling , especially in the weakly screened regime .",
    "overall , the ism approximation is shown to be more simple and more accurate than dhh at strong coupling .",
    "as such , it provides a good basis for developing more realistic models to describe thermodynamic properties of dusty plasmas and related systems under various natural and laboratory conditions .",
    "following our previous paper ,  @xcite we adopt the following simplified model .",
    "the two - component system consists of particles of charge @xmath0 and density @xmath1 immersed into a neutralizing medium , characterized by the charge @xmath2 and density @xmath3 ( relation to the conventional three - component dusty plasma is discussed in appendix  [ apa ] ) . in equilibrium",
    "the system is quasineutral , so that @xmath4 , where the subscript @xmath5 denotes unperturbed quantities .",
    "the system is characterized by two dimensionless parameters : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the wigner - seitz radius , @xmath8 is the temperature ( in energy units ) , and @xmath9 is the inverse screening length ( debye radius ) associated with the neutralizing medium . the coupling parameter @xmath10 is roughly the ratio of the coulomb interaction energy , evaluated at the mean interparticle separation , to the kinetic energy .",
    "the screening parameter @xmath11 is the ratio of the interparticle separation to the screening length .",
    "the main quantities of interest are the internal energy @xmath12 , helmholtz free energy @xmath13 , and pressure @xmath14 , associated with the particle component . in reduced units these are @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of particles in the volume @xmath17 ( so that @xmath18 ) .",
    "the ion sphere model for the non - ideal ocp has the following simple physical interpretation .",
    "@xcite consider @xmath16 charged particles immersed in the uniform neutralizing background .",
    "due to the strong coulomb repulsive interaction between the particles , they tend to form a regular structure with the interparticle distance of order @xmath19 .",
    "one can think of a collection of @xmath16 particles together with a spherical piece of the uniform background of radius @xmath19 , which exactly compensates the particle charge .",
    "it is then assumed that the energy of the system is just the sum of the energies of such spheres .",
    "the energy of the sphere can be easily calculated via purely electrostatic arguments , resulting in the celebrated expression @xmath20 the numerical coefficient @xmath21 is very close to the madelung constants of the body - centered - cubic ( bcc ) and face - ceneterd - cubic ( fcc ) crystals , which are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "some modifications are required when applying these arguments to the yukawa system .",
    "we again divide the system into @xmath16 charge neutral cells ( ion spheres ) of radius @xmath19 , with each particle placed in the center of the cell .",
    "the electrical potential inside the cell is given by the poisson equation @xmath24 the density of the neutralizing medium satisfies the linearized boltzmann relation @xmath25 the general solution of the poisson equation has the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath27 are the coefficients to be determined .",
    "to do this we use the boundary condition @xmath28 , which follows from the cell charge neutrality .",
    "the second requirement is @xmath29 , implying that @xmath30 tends to @xmath31 as @xmath32 .",
    "these conditions yield @xmath27 and @xmath33 and hence the electrical potential inside the cell , @xmath34 where the first term is the conventional debye - hckel potential of an individual particle in plasma and the last two terms arise due to requirements imposed by the ion sphere model .",

    "it is instructive to compare the ( @xmath11-dependent ) coefficient of proportionality with the values of the madelung constant , defined as @xmath39 the exact values of the static energy and hence @xmath40 depend on the lattice type formed by the particles .",
    "yukawa systems are known to form either bcc or fcc lattices in the equilibrium solid phase . in real dusty plasma experiments , the solid phase is often dominated by the hexagonal - close - packed ( hcp ) structures ,  @xcite which possibly indicates the non - equilibrium character of these systems or some deviations from the yukawa interaction potential between the particles .",
    "conventional yukawa fluids freeze into the bcc solid in the regime of week screening and into the fcc solid at strong screening .",
