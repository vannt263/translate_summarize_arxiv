    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "since the equation for @xmath57 is nonlinear , it is reasonable to linearize it around the background solution @xmath58 by defining @xmath59 . after neglecting the quadratic term , one obtains the following linear equation : @xmath60 since it is usually possible to find an analytical solution for @xmath58 , one is then left with only a linear equation for @xmath61 , which is easier to solve than the full non - linear equation .    apart from the equations themselves , another important key aspect of the analysis is to choose appropriate and meaningful initial conditions .",
    "for the uncorrected case , as it is usually done in quantum field theory , the bunch - davies vacuum will be chosen , which in this setting means @xmath62 .",
    "the case of an initial non - bunch - davies state was recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , as we have discussed in @xcite , the most natural initial conditions for the corrected case should be those that best resemble the properties of the bunch - davies vacuum .",

    "this will be different here .    to recap ,",
    "note that the task of obtaining quantum - gravitational corrections to the scalar and tensor power spectra reduces to solving equation with initial data .",
    "once this is done , one only needs to compute the corresponding power spectra using the relations and .",
    "in this section the well - known slow - roll approximation is described in order to clarify and set up the notation .",
    "in addition , several physical quantities , which appear in the key equations of motion and , will be explicitly given up to linear order in the slow - roll parameters , which we will define below .",

    "it can be shown that this is equivalent to assume that the slow - roll parameters @xmath67 and @xmath76 are small : @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "if one assumes those to be vanishing , one would recover the de sitter case analyzed in our previous paper @xcite . since the pure de sitter case is often too restrictive to make contact with observations",
    ", we shall now consider the first - order slow - roll approximation , which assumes @xmath67 and @xmath76 to be small but nonvanishing , and drop quadratic terms in those .    in order to solve the equations presented in the previous section in this approximation , we need to express the frequencies and , as well as the potential in terms of the conformal time @xmath2 and the slow - roll parameters @xmath67 and @xmath76 .",

    "note that setting @xmath86 , or equivalently @xmath87 , converts the equation for scalar perturbations into the one for tensor perturbations .",
    "therefore we will perform all calculations only for the scalar perturbations and obtain the results for the tensor perturbations using this relation at the end .    making use of the hamiltonian constraint as written in ,",
    "it is possible to write the rescaled potential as v = a^4 h^2(1- ) . in order to write this expression explicitly in terms of the conformal time and the slow - roll parameters",

    "physically , @xmath90 defines the de  sitter space - time we are considering as our reference . below we will have to choose a value for @xmath90 , since the results will depend on it .",

    "note that the present approximation is valid during times @xmath2 which obey |_0|^-1/|| |_0|^1/. due to the smallness of @xmath67 , this time range is very large . nonetheless ,",
    "when considering the asymptotic value for different physical objetcs as @xmath98 , one should take into account that in this limit the approximation breaks down .    finally ,",

    "it is necessary to evolve the scalar power spectrum through subsequent phases of the universe from the end of inflation until today .",
    "in addition , one finally needs to project it on the celestial sphere .",
    "this whole procedure can be reduced to compute the following integral , which is usually done numerically ,",
    "c^(i)_=_0^ ^(i)_(k)_^2(k ) , with @xmath216 denoting the uncorrected and corrected coefficients , respectively , and @xmath217 being the transfer function . for large scales ( small @xmath218 ) , however , it is possible to solve this integral analytically . in this regime ,",
    "the fluctuations were well outside the horizon at the end of recombination and thus they were not affected by subhorizon physics .",
    "therefore , it is only necessary to take into account the primordial spectrum and perform the projection on the celestial sphere .",

    "( k)=j_(k[_- _ ] ) , where @xmath220 is the conformal time at horizon crossing and @xmath221 the conformal time at recombination .",
    "let us define the quantum - gravitational correction to the temperature anisotropies in the following way , c_:=c_^(1)- c_^(0 ) . applying the results for the corrected scalar power spectrum",
    ", we get that , for large scales , this correction has the following form , c__0^()^4()^3 j^2_(k[_- _ ] ) , the approximate symbol in this equation stands for two reasons . on the one hand",
    ", we are assuming an approximated transfer function . and",
    ", on the other hand , the overall factor that appears in the correction term , which depends on the slow - roll parameters but is of order one , has been dropped . at this point ,",
    "as explained in @xcite , we use the fact that the bessel function is strongly peaked around @xmath222 and effectively acts as a dirac delta mapping between @xmath24 and @xmath218 .",
    "therefore , one can integrate the explicit @xmath24 dependences in the last integral , which leads to c_()^4 , while the implicit @xmath24-dependences on @xmath143 and @xmath67 should be evaluated at @xmath223 . applying exactly the same approximations , it is straightforward to obtain also the well - known result for the uncorrected temperature anisotropies at large scales : c_^(0 ) ( ) ^2 , which does not have any explicit dependence on @xmath224 and , for a scale - invariant spectrum ( constant @xmath143 and @xmath67 ) is just proportional to the inverse of @xmath225 .",
    "thus , due to a correction proportional to @xmath226 in the power spectrum , the temperature anisotropies get a correction that goes as the inverse of a fifth - order polynomial in @xmath218 for large scales .",
    "however , since the uncorrected @xmath227 go with @xmath228 , the relative correction @xmath229 is of order @xmath230 .",
    "as commented in the previous section , specially due to the presence of @xmath198 is this correction , it is difficult to be certain about its absolute value . we have thus plotted the behavior of the relative correction with respect to @xmath218 without the physical prefactors in fig .",

    "it is important to note that the qualitative behavior derived in this section for correction of the temperature anisotropies essentially comes from the explicit @xmath226 dependence of the correction of the power spectrum , which has been obtained in several approaches ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "we can also give an estimate of how large the hubble parameter , i.e.  the energy scale , during inflation would have to be such that one could see a correction of our type .",
    "given that cosmic variance behaves like = , one can conclude that for @xmath233 , where cosmic variance is about @xmath234 and our quantum - gravitational correction is given by 0.12()^2||k(_-_)|^3 , the remaining factors in the above expression would have to be larger than 5 in order to clearly see an effect in the cmb data . using @xmath235 , and given that @xmath236 can be estimated to be about @xmath237 ( see e.g.  tab .",
    "i in @xcite ) , the factor @xmath238 turns out to be of order @xmath239 .",
    "therefore , in order to see an effect , @xmath240 would be required , which is by far outside the range allowed by the measured tensor - to - scalar ratio . moreover ,",
    "if we use the maximum allowed value by the latter limit for the hubble factor , it would be necessary for @xmath198 to be around @xmath241 to get an observable effect .",
    "this value is significantly smaller than the maximum value @xmath215 derived in .",
    "in this paper quantum - gravitational corrections for the power spectra of the gauge - invariant scalar and tensor perturbations have been obtained in the slow - roll regime . in particular , the corrected form for the scalar and tensor power spectrum is given , respectively , by and , where @xmath144 is given in and @xmath151 in in terms of the numerical coefficients @xmath145 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "these coefficients have been computed by solving the linearized evolution equation for the gaussian width @xmath130 with natural initial data ( in the sense that the initial state , which is constructed as a small deformation of the usual bunch ",

    "their values are given in , , and , respectively .",
    "the above results generalize the results for the de  sitter case obtained earlier in @xcite to a more realistic scenario of slow - roll inflation .",
    "in particular , and as one would naively expect , the main part of the correction is due to the de sitter contribution ( which introduces an enhancement of the spectrum ) , whereas the slow - roll part slightly modifies it .",
    "let us at this point briefly comment on the results of @xcite , obtained from an alternative expansion of the wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "as in our treatment , the authors find quantum - gravitational correction terms proportional to @xmath242 .",
    "nonetheless , their result for the slow - roll approximation is not just a small perturbation of the de  sitter case , but can give a comparable contribution for large scales , which can even lead to a power - loss instead of an enhancement of the power spectra .",
    "moreover , let us stress that the kind of correction that has been obtained in this analysis",
    " being proportional to the factor @xmath243  has appeared in several different approaches in the context of quantum geometrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the form of this correction is not completely unexpected .",
    "in fact , it is possible to argue , already on dimensional grounds , that @xmath244 is the only non - dimensional parameter that one could use to include perturbatively ( as a power series expansion ) quantum - gravity corrections .",
    "furthermore since , due to the background homogeneity , one needs to introduce explicitly a volume ( @xmath245 ) in order to regularize the spatial integral in the action , another dimensionless quantity @xmath246 enters the game . nevertheless , in principle",
    ", the power of this latter quantity might have been different and thus it is very interesting to see how the same correction is explicitly realized in different specific models .",
    "in the last section we have also analyzed the magnitude of the obtained corrections and the possibility of observing them experimentally .",
    "the most difficult issue in order to give a precise estimation is that , due to the regularization of the spatial integral in the action , a length scale needs to be considered .",
    "the power spectrum then depends on that length scale and there seems to be nothing physical to fix it . as we have commented , in the main part of the paper , the most reasonable choice is to take it as an infrared cut - off , relating it to the largest observable scale in the cmb . in our case , just to give an approximated estimate , we have chosen it as the length scale of a typical mode that affects the cmb . in particular",
    "we have chosen the pivot scale selected by the planck mission . in this way",
    ", we have obtained that the corrections for all different parameters of the power spectra ( spectral indices and runnings ) are well inside the current experimental error bars .",
    "finally , we have also obtained the qualitative form of the correction induced in the cmb temperature anisotropies by this quantum - gravity effect .",
    "the analysis we have performed is valid for large scales ( small @xmath218 ) , for which quantum - gravity effects are expected to be more relevant . in particular , it shows that a correction of the form @xmath226 which , as commented above , seems very generic in this context , leads to a relative correction of the order @xmath230 for the anisotropies , which thus quickly declines with increasing @xmath218 .    with this paper",
    "we conclude our investigations on quantum - gravitational corrections arising from a canonical quantization of a perturbed universe model using the wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "the effects on large scales we have obtained are , for a reasonable choice of @xmath198 , not observable in the cmb data and since we have used a generic slow - roll model that encompasses a wide range of inflationary models , using more refined models that obey the slow - roll approximation would not enhance the corrections .",
    "nonetheless , it is still an open question whether such corrections can be observed in situations where cosmic variance is not present ; for example , in galaxy - galaxy correlation functions .",

    "<S> we continue our study on corrections from canonical quantum gravity to the power spectra of gauge - invariant inflationary scalar and tensor perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> a direct canonical quantization of a perturbed inflationary universe model is implemented , which leads to a wheeler - dewitt equation . for this equation , </S>",
    "<S> a semiclassical approximation is applied in order to obtain a schrdinger equation with quantum - gravitational correction terms , from which we calculate the corrections to the power spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we go beyond the de sitter case discussed earlier and analyze our model in the first slow - roll approximation , considering terms linear in the slow - roll parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dominant correction term from the de sitter case , which leads to an enhancement of power on the largest scales , gets modified by terms proportional to the slow - roll parameters . </S>",
    "<S> a correction to the tensor - to - scalar ratio is also found at second order in the slow - roll parameters . making use of the available experimental data , </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of these quantum - gravitational corrections is estimated . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the effects for the temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background are qualitatively obtained . </S>"
