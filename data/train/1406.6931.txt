    "in this article we investigate the structure of spaces of holomorphic functions defined on an open subset of @xmath0 that can be written as a countable intersection of countable unions of weighted banach spaces of holomorphic functions where the latter are defined by weighted sup - norms .",
    "the spaces we are interested in are examples of plb - spaces , i.e.  countable projective limits of countable inductive limits of banach spaces .",
    "spaces of this type arise naturally in analysis , for instance the space of distributions , the space of real analytic functions and several spaces of ultradifferentiable functions and ultradistributions are of this type .",
    "in particular , some of the mixed spaces of ultradistributions ( studied recently by schmets , valdivia @xcite ) appear to be weighted plb - spaces of holomorphic functions ( see ( * ? ? ? * section 15 ) for details ) .",
    "in fact , all the forementioned spaces are even pls - spaces that is the linking maps in the inductive spectra of banach spaces are compact and some of them even appear to be pln - spaces ( i.e.  the linking maps are nuclear ) . during the last years the theory of pls - spaces has played an important role in the application of abstract functional analytic methods to several classical problems in analysis .",
    "we refer to the survey article @xcite of domaski for applications , examples and further references .",
    "+ many of the applications reviewed by domaski @xcite are based on the theory of the so - called first derived functor of the projective limit functor .",
    "this method has its origin in the application of homological algebra to functional analysis .",
    "the research on this subject was started by palamodov @xcite in the late sixties and carried on since the mid eighties by vogt @xcite and many others .",
    "we refer to the book of wengenroth @xcite , who laid down a systematic study of homological tools in functional analysis and in particular presents many ready - for - use results concerning concrete analytic problems .",
    "in particular , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5 ) illustrates that for the splitting theory of frchet or more general locally convex spaces , the consideration of plb - spaces which are not pls - spaces is indispensable . +",
    "a major application of the theory of the derived projective limit functor @xmath1 is the connection between its vanishing on a countable projective spectrum of lb - spaces and locally convex properties of the projective limit of the spectrum ( e.g.  being ultrabornological or barrelled ) .",
    "this connection was firstly noticed by vogt @xcite , see ( * ? ? ? * and 3.3.6 ) , who also gave characterizations of the vanishing of @xmath1 and the forementioned properties in the case of sequence spaces , cf .",
    "* section 4 ) . a natural extension of vogt s",
    "work is to study the case of continuous functions , which was the subject of the thesis of agethen @xcite .",
    "recently , an extended and improved version of her results was published by agethen , bierstedt , bonet @xcite .",
    "in addition to the study of the projective limit functor , agethen , bierstedt , bonet studied the interchangeability of projective and inductive limit , i.e.  the question when the plb - spaces are equal to the weighted lf - spaces of continuous functions studied for the first time by bierstedt , bonet @xcite . in view of the results of @xcite ,",
    "it is a natural objective to extend the investigation on weighted plb - spaces of holomorphic functions , having in mind the same type of questions .",
    "+ as in the case of sequence spaces and continuous functions the starting point in the definition of weighted plb - spaces of holomorphic functions is a double sequence of strictly positive and continuous functions ( weights ) ; in section [ preliminaries ] we precise the latter and establish further terminology and basic properties of the weighted plb - spaces of holomorphic functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 under o- and o - growth conditions . according to the above , our first aim is then the characterization of locally convex properties of the spaces in terms of the defining sequence .",
    "this task is splitted in two parts : in section [ necessary ] we study necessary conditions for barrelledness of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this is possible within a setting of rather mild assumptions , whose definition is motivated by the article @xcite of bierstedt , bonet , galbis . in section",
    "[ sufficient ] we turn to sufficient conditions for ultrabornologicity and barrelledness , where we have to decompose holomorphic functions in order to utilize the homological methods mentioned earlier and also to apply a criterion explained in @xcite by bonet , wegner which we need for our investigation of the o - growth case . since there is up to now no method available , which allows a decomposition of holomorphic functions in broad generality ( in contrast to the case of continuous functions , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , we restrict ourselves to the unit disc and introduce a class of weights for which decomposition is possible .",
    "the definition of this class traces back to work of bierstedt , bonet @xcite and strongly relies on results of lusky @xcite . in section [ inter ] , we study the interchangeability of projective and inductive limit , which is of course closely connected with weighted lf - spaces of holomorphic functions , defined and studied recently by bierstedt , bonet @xcite . unfortunately , in all the results of sections [ necessary ]  [ inter ] the necessary conditions are slightly but strictly weaker than the sufficient conditions .",
    "therefore , in section 6 we consider the case in which all the weights are essential in the sense of taskinen and we also assume condition @xmath4 of bierstedt and bonet [ 6 ] . under these further assumptions",
    "we provide full characterizations of ultrabornologicity and the interchangeability of projective and inductive limit .",
    "the examples we discuss in the final section 7 illustrate that the new assumptions of section 6 are rather natural .",

    "+ an important tool to handle weighted spaces of holomorphic functions is the technique of associated weights or growth conditions mentioned by anderson , duncan @xcite , studied for the first time in a systematic way by bierstedt , bonet , taskinen @xcite and used in many articles dealing with weighted spaces of holomorphic functions . for a given weight @xmath8",

    "in what follows we establish necessary conditions for barrelledness of the spaces @xmath2 and @xmath3 . this is possible under rather mild assumptions . in @xcite bierstedt ,",
    "bonet , galbis studied the following setting : @xmath5 is balanced , all considered weights are radial ( i.e.  for each weight @xmath8 they assume @xmath65 for every @xmath66 with @xmath67 ) , the banach space topologies are stronger than co and the polynomials are contained in all the considered spaces .",
    "they remark that for bounded @xmath5 the latter is equivalent to requiring that each weight @xmath68 extends continuously to @xmath69 with @xmath70 , while for @xmath71 the assumption means exactly that each weight @xmath68 is rapidly decreasing at @xmath72 ( cf .",

    "since the condition in [ bonet - proper].(iii ) at first glance looks hard to actualize , let us give a hint at a possible construction of @xmath8 and @xmath125 satisfying this condition .",

    "now we may select @xmath271 with @xmath272 such that @xmath273 and @xmath274 tend to infinity for @xmath275 tending to infinity ( in the above example we may for instance take @xmath276 ) . by the properties of @xmath277 we thus get @xmath278 .",
