    "the composer arnold schnberg held that joy or excitement in listening to music originates from the struggle between two opposing impulses , `` the demand for repetition of pleasant stimuli , and the opposing desire for variety , for change , for a new stimulus . ''",
    "these two driving forces  the demand for repetition or uniformity and the desire for variety  influence not only how we perceive popular music , but also how it is produced . this can be seen e.g. in one of last year s critically most acclaimed albums , daft punk s _ random access memories_. at the beginning of the production process of the album the duo behind daft punk felt that the electronic music genre was in its comfort zone and not moving one inch @xcite .",
    "they attributed this identity crisis to the fact that artists in this genre mostly miss the tools to create original sounds and rely too heavily on computers with the same libraries of sounds and preset banks @xcite . _",
    "random access memories _ was finally produced with the help of 27 other featured artists or exceptional session musicians , who were asked to play riffs and individual patterns to give the duo a vast library to select from @xcite .",
    "the percussionist stated that he used every drum he owns on the album ; there is also a track composed of over 250 different elements .",
    "the record was awarded the album of the year 2013 grammy and received a metacritic review of universal acclaim for , e.g. breath[ing ] life into the safe music that dominates today s",
    "charts @xcite .",
    "however , the best - selling album of 2013 in the us was not from daft punk , but _ the 20/20 experience _ by justin timberlake .",
    "the producer of this album , timothy mosley , contributed 25 billboard top 40 singles between 2005 - 2010 , more than any other producer @xcite .",
    "all these records featured a unique production style consisting of vocal sounds imitating turntable scratching , quick keyboard arabesques , grunts as percussion @xcite .",
    "asked about his target audience , mosley said i know where my bread and butter is at .",
    "[ ... ] i did this research .",
    "it s the women who watch sex and the city @xcite .",
    "these two anecdotes illustrate how schnberg s two opposing forces , the demand for both uniformity and variety , influence the crafting of popular music .",
    "the daft punk example suggests that innovation and increased variety is closely linked to the involved musicians skills and thereby to novel production tools and technologies .",
    "the example of mosley shows how uniformity in stylistic expressions can satisfy listener demands and produce large sales numbers over an extended period of time .",
    "the _ complexity _ of a style is determined by the set of specialized skills that are typically required of musicians to play that style .",
    "complexity of a style increases with ( i ) the number of skills required for the style and ( ii ) the degree of specialization of these skills .",
    "a highly complex music style requires a diverse set of skills that are only available to a small number of other styles .",
    "a style of low complexity requires only a small set of generic and ubiquitous skills , that can be found in a large number of other styles .",
    "while it is hard to quantify skills of musicians and their capabilities directly , they can be related to the instrumentation typically used within a given music style . if a music style requires a highly diverse set of skills , this will to some degree",
    "also be reflected in a higher number of different instruments and production technologies . in general",
    ", demand for variety translates into a larger number of instruments used in the production process .",
    "more diverse instrumentation indicates a higher number of skills of the involved musicians .",
    "desire for uniformity favors a limited variability in instrumentation in a production .",
    "music styles with high complexity therefore have large instrumental variety and at the same time low uniformity .",
    "it follows that the desire for variety and uniformity are not only relevant for the perception of musical patterns .",
    "the notions of variety and uniformity also apply to the involved capabilities of musicians and the instrumentations for their pieces .",
    "progress in a quantitative understanding of systemic trends in the music industry has been fueled by the recent availability and growth of online music databases , such as _ www.discogs.com _ or _",
    "www.allmusic.com_. this data allows to uncover basic properties of collaboration and networks of artists @xcite , or to map song moods and listening habits of a large group of people @xcite .",

    "it has been shown that big cities tend to create more innovative styles @xcite .",
    "recently an experiment was designed to determine the unpredictability of the success of a song without taking into account traditional marketing strategies such as broadcasting @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that audiences prefer music of intermediate complexity , the so - called `` optimal complexity hypothesis '' @xcite . in @xcite popular music over the last fifty years was studied by analyzing pitch , timbre , and loudness of records .",
    "timbre , an attribute of the quality of sound , and _ the _ fingerprint of musical instruments , was found to experience growing homogenization over time .    in this work",
    "we quantify the variety and uniformity of music styles in terms of instrumentation that is typically used for their production .",
    "we employ a user - generated music taxonomy where albums are classified as belonging to one of fifteen different music genres which contain 374 different music styles as subcategories .",
    "we show that styles belonging to the same music genre are characterized by similar instrumentation .",
    "we use this fact to construct a similarity network of styles , whose branches are identified as music genres .",
    "we characterize the complexity of each music style by its variety and uniformity and show ( i ) that there is a remarkable relationship between varieties and uniformities of music styles , ( ii ) that the complexity of individual styles may exhibit dramatic changes across the past fifty years , and ( iii ) that these changes in complexity are related to the typical sales numbers of the music style .",
