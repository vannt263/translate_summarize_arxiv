    "constraining primordial non - gaussianity offers a powerful test of the generation mechanism of cosmological perturbations in the early universe . while standard single - field models of slow - roll inflation lead to small departures from gaussianity , non - standard scenarios allow for a larger level of non - gaussianity ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
