    "quantum contextuality is the statement that the result of an experiment depends on the other mutually compatible measurements that may potentially be performed .",
    "this surprising non - classical ( and non - local ) property was first pointed out by kochen and specker ( the ks - theorem ) from a judiciously choosen set of @xmath0 rays / vectors of the real three - dimensional space .",
    "later , it was simplified to a highly symmetric arrangement of @xmath1 rays attached to cube of edge size @xmath2 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , p. 198 ) . in this pionnering work",
    ", a context means a maximal set of mutually compatible / commuting observables .",
    "in essence , a ks - proof is the impossibility to assign the value @xmath3 ( @xmath3 means true ) to one single ray in a complete orthonormal basis , while preserving the identity of the ray , and that of the other rays , in all separate ( complete ) bases . in particular , no two orthogonal rays",
    "can both be assigned @xmath3 .",
    "the less stringent option that the rays do not necessary belong to a complete orthonormal basis , but to maximal sets of mutually orthogonal rays , was emphasized in a recent paper @xcite . in the following ,",
    "a proof of quantum contextuality consists of a finite sets of rays that can not be each assigned the values @xmath4 or @xmath3 in such a way that ( i ) in any group of mutually orthogonal rays , not all the rays are assigned the value @xmath4 and ( ii ) no two orthogonal rays are both assigned the value @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "yu and oh proof of state - independent contextuality ( sic ) only needs @xmath5 rays attached to a cube of edge size @xmath3 as follows @xmath6 let us index the rays consecutively from @xmath3 to @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath7 , @xmath8 the following orthogonality relations between triples and pairs of vectors are satisfied @xmath9 it is straigthforward to check that , while it is possible to assign the value @xmath3 to one and only one ray of the four complete bases ( triads ) above , while preserving the identity of the other rays that are henceforth assigned the value @xmath4 , it is not possible to do so with all the remaining orthogonal pairs .",
    "the end result of an assignment @xmath3 to a single ray in all four triads immediately leads to a contradiction to non - contextuality because two orthogonal rays in a pair may both be assigned @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , an experimentally testable inequality involving the @xmath5 projectors associated to the rays is found to be satisfied by all non - contextual hidden variable models while being violated by all three - level states ( * ? ? ? * eq .",
    "( 4 ) ) .",
    "yu and oh s orthogonality graph is easily shown to be non - planar , of automorphism group @xmath10 ( the semidirect product of the klein group by the three - letter symmetric group ) , and of chromatic number @xmath11 . in a recent paper @xcite , it is proposed that a sic proof with an arrangement of @xmath12 rays in dimension @xmath13 is such that the orthogonality graph of the rays has chromatic number @xmath14 , and conversely , see @xcite for the ins and outs of the latter statement .    to finalize this introduction ,",
    "let us remind that there exist even smaller proofs of quantum contextuality that are state - dependent , as the @xmath15-ray set @xcite ( a subset of the yu and oh s set @xmath16 ) @xmath17 the orthogonality relations may be easily infered from the @xmath5-ray set above as @xmath18 the corresponding graph is planar , of automorphism group @xmath19 and its faces consist of two triangles , two pentagons and one heptagon .",

    "the reason why the pentagon and the @xmath15-vertex configuration ( [ 8vertex ] ) are basic building blocks of the kochen - specker theorem and related quantum paradoxes is given in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in the present paper , inspired by the recent progress about quantum contextuality with a small number of rays in the three - dimensional space @xcite-@xcite , and by the proofs of the kochen - specker theorem in the four - dimensional space @xcite-@xcite",
    ", we asked ourselves what is the smallest configuration of a single qudit system , with rays belonging to the real eigenstates of the corresponding pauli group , leading to quantum contextuality ?",
    "a qudit may be seen as @xmath13-level system , i.e. a qubit ( two levels ) corresponds to spin @xmath20 , a qutrit ( three levels ) corresponds to spin @xmath3 , a quartit ( four levels ) corresponds to a spin @xmath21 system , an octit ( eight levels ) correponds to a spin @xmath22 system and so on ; these spin systems may be manipulated experimentally by applying selective radio frequency pulses at the resonance frequency between two energy levels .    in the present paper",
    ", we find that one needs at least @xmath23 levels for displaying quantum contextuality of a single qudit .",
    "in particular , we single out and characterize contextual sets of @xmath24 and @xmath25 rays that form non - planar orthogonality graphs with non trivial shannon capacity .",
    "a single @xmath13-dimensional qudit is defined by a weyl pair @xmath26 of _ shift _ and _ clock _ cyclic operators satisfying @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a primitive @xmath13-th root of unity and @xmath4 is the null @xmath13-dimensional matrix . in the standard computational basis @xmath29 , the explicit form of the pair is as follows @xmath30 the weyl pair generates the single qudit pauli group @xmath31 , of order @xmath32 , where each element may be written in a unique way as @xmath33 , with @xmath34 .",
    "the study of commutation relations in a arbitrary single qudit system may be based on the study of symplectic modules over the modular ring @xmath35 .",
    "let us define a _",
    "isotropic line _ as a set of @xmath13 points on the lattice @xmath35 such that the symplectic product of any two of them is @xmath36 .",
    "to such an isotropic line corresponds a maximal commuting set in the quotient group @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the center of the group @xcite-@xcite .",
    "there exist @xmath39 isotropic lines / maximal commuting sets ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 5))- ( * ? ? ? * eq . ( 3 ) ) , where @xmath39 is the sum of divisor function .",
    "one finds a total amount of @xmath40 distinct vectors / rays as eigenstates of the operators on the isotropic lines , a formula still to be established rigorously .    in the following we are interested in the real subset of the aforementioned rays and the orthogonal graph they form .",
    "it is not a trivial task to get it , it is why we made an extensive use of the magma software @xcite for the matrix calculations , the extraction of the maximum cliques of the commutation graph between the operators within the pauli group , the search of the eigenstates of the operators , the filtering of the real eigenstates and the derivation of their orthogonality graph .",

    "one is left with @xmath51 vectors that form a total amount of @xmath54 maximal cliques of orthogonal vectors , @xmath15 of them of size @xmath23 and the remaining ones of smaller sizes @xmath50 to @xmath15 .",
    "note that the decomposition @xmath55 mimicks the decomposition of the number of isotropic lines of operators @xmath56 into @xmath57 operators that form the projective line @xmath58 and @xmath50 outliers ( * ? ? ?",

    "in the very last base , the ray @xmath25 has to be assigned @xmath3 ( true ) , the other rays in the @xmath65 bases containing ray @xmath25 have to be assigned @xmath4 and it becomes impossible to assign @xmath3 to any of the rays in the @xmath50 bases @xmath66 , located at the fourth line of our list , in violation of the condition ( i ) ( of the introduction ) required for non - contextuality .",
    "the proof proceeds similarly if one chooses to assign @xmath3 to any of the five rays in the first base .",
    "the proof is minimal in the sense that no further ray can be removed from the eleven ones while preserving the contradiction to non - contextuality .",
    "the orthogonality graph of our @xmath24-vertex arrangement , now denoted @xmath67 , contains the disjoint complete graphs @xmath68 ( formed by the rays @xmath3 to @xmath69 ) and @xmath70 ( formed by the rays @xmath71 to @xmath24 ) and is thus non - planar of chromatic number @xmath69 .",
