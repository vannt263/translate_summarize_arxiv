    "sixa ( silicon x - ray array ) spectrometer @xcite is a focal plane instrument of the sodart x - ray telescope onboard the spectrum - x - gamma satellite .",
    "sixa is an array of 19 discrete si(li ) detector elements which collect x - rays in the range 0.520  kev with an energy resolution of about 200  ev at 6  kev .",
    "the elements are circular with an active diameter of 9.2  mm and they are arranged in a hexagonal pattern with a centreline distance of 12  mm .",
    "the detector crystals are kept at a temperature of about 120  k by a passive cooling system .",
    "x - rays focussed by the telescope enter the detector through an entrance window which forms a part of the cooler shield .",
    "the x - ray entrance window for sixa was fabricated by metorex international oy .",
    "a specific advantage of this window construction @xcite is that a polyimide mesh is utilised to support an ultrathin polyimide membrane .",
    "thus the active area of the window ( 70  mm in diameter ) is shadowed by the support structure only at the lowest x - ray energies .",
    "in addition to being transparent in x - rays , the window is required to be tight against heat leakage , opaque to light from near  ir to far  uv and compatible with space environment .",
    "the window comprises two separate units , both coated with aluminium .    because the window absorbs a considerable fraction of the softer x - rays , determination of its x - ray transmittance is an important part of the detector characterisation .",
    "transmission properties can be fairly well predicted from tabulated data for the constituent elements over the energy range of sixa except for the regions above the k  absorption edges of aluminium and oxygen .",
    "transmission in these regions is affected by x - ray absorption fine structure ( xafs ) which depends on the chemical structure of the materials .",
    "we applied synchrotron radiation from the electron storage ring bessy to investigate the soft x - ray transmission properties .",
    "in addition to the energy dependence of the transmittance , we studied the dependence on the position on the window surface .",
    "as sixa consists of large elements which do not have any spatial resolution , only large scale positional variations were of interest .",
    "furthermore , we studied the opacity to light , which is required to suppress the degradation of the x - ray detection performance by photocurrent in the si(li ) crystals .",
    "in the fabrication process a layer of bpda - ppd pi-2610 polyimide was first made by spin casting a low viscosity polyamic acid resin onto a silicon wafer and baking the resin for conversion to polyimide . next the support grid",
    "was formed of photosensitive pi-2732 polyimide which was patterned into a hexagonal honeycomb structure with a 500  @xmath0 m pitch .",
    "finally , the silicon substrate was removed and a 30  nm layer of aluminium was sputtered on both sides .",
    "thus one window unit consists of a thin layer of polyimide , a polyimide support grid , and a layer of aluminium on each surface .",
    "the chemical composition of the polyimide is hcno and its bulk density is about 1.4  g/@xmath1 . the density of the thin film polyimide is about 5% higher .",
    "a set of window units was manufactured and the best ones were selected for the flight model ( fm ) and the flight spare model ( fsm ) of sixa .",
    "the polyimide parameters of these as well as a few other units used for calibration are given in table  [ tab : pi ] .",
    "nominal aluminium thickness is 60  nm for all units in the table .",
    "native oxide layers of thickness of about 3  nm are formed on the aluminium coatings .",
    "thicknesses of the polyimide membranes were measured with a calibrated profilometer and they varied from 237 to 275  nm .",
    "however , it was found later that a soft coating on a hard substrate , such as polyimide on silicon , is compressed during the measurement @xcite .",
    "the tabulated values have been corrected to account for the error .",
    "the shadowing figures are averaged , which is sufficient because the detector elements are large compared to the mesh ( the active area covers 300 hexagons ) .",
    "window units 19 and 14 were used for the x - ray transmission measurements .",
    "the main purpose of the experiment was to measure the x - ray absorption fine structures which would be used to calculate the transmission properties of the fm and fsm window units . as all window units are composed of similar layers produced by the same process , they are likely to have similar xafs",
    ".    the soft x - ray transmittance of the two window units was studied at the sx700 plane grating monochromator beamline @xcite of the radiometry laboratory of the physikalisch - technische bundesanstalt ( ptb ) which is located at the bessy synchrotron facility .",
    "control over the position of the beam was provided by a movable sample holder .",
    "the beam covered the area of about 5  hexagons of the honeycomb grid structure with its full width at tenth maximum ( 1.5  mm horizontal and 0.8  mm vertical ) .",
    "consequently , the fraction @xmath2 of the beam shaded by the grid was affected by the precise positioning of the beam , and the values of @xmath2 during separate measurements varied about the average shadowing given in table  [ tab : pi ] .",
    "transmittance as a function of energy was obtained by scanning photon energies from 60  ev to 1800  ev with steps varying from 0.1  ev to 10  ev , depending on the expected detailed features in the transmittance curve .",
    "the beam was positioned at the centre .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : e - scan ] .",
    "the similarity of the two window units throughout the measured range , including the absorption edges , suggests that xafs is indeed identical for all sixa window units .",
    "the near - edge structures of the polyimide constituents resemble those reported for other windows manufactured by metorex @xcite , while xafs of aluminium is different which is natural because there are no aln layers in our windows .",
    "dependence on position was studied by performing line scans in the @xmath3 direction across the window surface at a few settings of the @xmath4 coordinate .",
    "this was repeated at four discrete energies slightly below the k  edges of the elements c , n , o and al .",
    "the scan step was 2  mm .",
    "transmission along the scanned lines is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : x - scan ] .",
    "it was originally measured in arbitrary units and later scaled to the transmittances of the energy scans by fitting a second order polynomial to the data from the scan along @xmath5 and setting the value of the polynomial in the centre ( its @xmath3 coordinate being that obtained in the analysis in section [ x - scan ] ) equal to the energy scan transmittance at the respective energy .",
    "the transmittance grows with the radial distance from the centre of the window .",
    "the model of the transmittance of a window unit is @xmath6      \\left\\ { 1 - s + s \\exp \\left [ - \\left ( \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho } \\right)_4                      \\rho_4 t_4                 \\right ]      \\right\\ } , \\ ] ] where the sum goes over the three thin film materials ( aluminium , oxide and polyimide ) and index 4 refers to the grid .",
    "this equation , with the experimental data for @xmath7 , was applied to calculate the mass attenuation coefficients ( @xmath8 ) wherein the fine structures are incorporated .",
    "the transmittance of the fm window units was then calculated using the model and the values of table  [ tab : pi ] for @xmath2 and the layer thicknesses @xmath9 .    the experimental data is compared to the model ( eq .  [ model ] with absorption data from ref .",

    "[ fig : fit]a .",
    "the difference between the residuals of the two window units is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit]b . the residuals exhibit considerable structure above each absorption edge with very similar shape for the two units .",
    "most of the residuals can therefore be attributed to xafs which can extend several hundred ev above the k  edges .",
    "the residuals in the range 6001550  ev are due to the deviation of the actual beam shadowing @xmath2 during the energy scans from the average values in table  [ tab : pi ] .",
    "measurement errors and errors in the @xmath9 data of table  [ tab : pi ] are also partly responsible for the residuals .",
    "because the contribution to the residuals from the errors in the @xmath9 is smaller than the features arising from xafs , more accurate values for the @xmath9 than those in table  [ tab : pi ] can not be abstracted from the data .",
    "moreover , derivation of layer thicknesses from transmission data yields poor results in general , because the dependence of @xmath8 on the x - ray energy is very similar for all materials outside the xafs regions . in consequence , when fitting a function of the form of eq .  [ model ] to the data , the thicknesses are strongly correlated and their best - fit values have very large error ranges .",
    "however , the difference between the residual curves of the two units can be attributed to relative errors in the @xmath9 between the units .",
    "we reduced the relative errors with a set of relative corrections @xmath10 , where the corrected values of the layer thicknesses @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the two units are @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "first we minimised the @xmath15 norm of the difference in the range 60530  ev with the beam shadowing and the corrections of the thin film thicknesses as free parameters .",
    "this energy region was chosen because it contains structures which bear relationships with these parameters , whereas the intermediate region 5301560  ev was excluded because in this region measurement errors are greater than the errors attributable to the @xmath9 ( see e.g.  the abrupt changes in the difference curve at 690  ev and 900  ev , and note that the absolute deviation of the data from the model is much smaller at the lower energies where the transmittance is small ) .",
    "the result was @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18  nm ( for the original aluminium thickness before oxidation ) , @xmath19  nm , and @xmath20  nm . next the correction of the grid thicknesses was sought that minimised the @xmath15 norm of the difference in the range 15601800  ev , yielding @xmath21  @xmath0 m .",

    "[ fig : al ] for the two xafs regions above the k and l absorption edges .",
    "the fine structures are typical of a solid , consisting of a multiple scattering peak in the narrow xanes ( x - ray absorption near - edge structure ) region just above the absorption edge and oscillations from single scattering in the wider exafs ( extended xafs ) region .",
    "small differences between the two units are seen in the k - edge xafs , and exafs clearly continues beyond 1800  ev . the results for carbon , nitrogen and oxygen are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cno ] .",

    "the flux on the focal plane of sodart is then @xmath67  @xmath50s@xmath68 .",
    "if all photons were absorbed in one element with 100% efficiency , the photocurrent without a window would be 12  pa and the resolution would be degraded by 60  ev ( from 200  ev ) .",
    "if @xmath69 was reduced by two magnitudes with a 1% transmitting window , the resolution would increase by 0.7  ev only .",
    "silicon detectors can have very high quantum efficiencies for visible light up to a cutoff wavelength which corresponds to the energy gap and is about 1.06  @xmath0 m at the operating temperature of sixa .",
    "for sixa crystals , @xmath57 depends mainly on the reflection and absorption properties of the cathode coating ( gold  palladium alloy ) on the detector surface . in addition , the incident flux is amplified by multiple reflections between the cathode and the window .",

    "interference peaks in the transmittance computed using data of table  [ tab : pi ] for unit 16 ( dotted curve ) are shifted by 100200  nm towards shorter wavelengths compared to the measured data .",
    "interference wavelengths depend on the thickness of the polyimide membrane , but the shift does not necessarily imply a large error in the thickness measurement . instead , the optical constants of the thin film polyimide are probably different from those incorporated in the program because the material is denser than the bulk material and the polyimide is also of another type . with a 20% greater thickness for the polyimide ,",
