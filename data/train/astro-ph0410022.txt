    "has been detected in the halos of several spiral galaxies .",
    "studies of the edge - on galaxies @xcite and @xcite , and the intermediate inclination galaxy @xcite have revealed a thick layer of  rotating more slowely than the underlying disk ( see oosterloo et al . , this conference , for an overview of these studies ) .",
    "the origin of such a thick layer or halo is unknown .",
    "there are various possibilities .",
    "one of them is the galactic fountain mechanism according to which active star formation in the disk and supernovae are responsible for blowing the gas into the halo .",
    "+ the galaxies mentioned above are seen under suitable orientations for a study of the vertical  distribution and the general kinematics .",
    "vertical motions are instead best observed in face - on galaxies . + for this purpose we have obtained new , deep  observations with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) of , a nearby face - on spiral galaxy showing moderate star formation activity . + in addition we have chosen as a case of a galaxy with an extreme starburst , in order to trace the effects on the  in such a limiting case . for this galaxy",
    "we have used  data from the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "is a nearby ( 6 mpc ) face - on spiral galaxy of type scd .",
    "it has a moderate star formation activity similar to that of the milky way .",
    "the  disk shows a large number of holes ( see fig . 1 , left panel ) .",
    "the holes may have originated from the explosions of many supernovae .",
    "+    besides the large number of holes , shows a significant amount of  with anomalous velocities .",
    "@xcite showed that has a widespread high velocity gas component , but they could only reveal it by heavily smoothing the data .",
    "+ with our observations we have the sensitivity to study the gas distribution and kinematics in detail . as shown in the top right panel of fig . 1",
    ", we are detecting several individual complexes of  with anomalous velocities .",
    "most of the complexes appear to have velocities lower than rotation , such as the beard gas in @xcite .",
    "but there are also velocities higher than the local disk rotational velocity , sometimes in excess of 100 km / s .",
    "the inclination of is such that these are probably vertical motions .",
    "+ the arrows in the left and top right panels of fig .",
    "1 indicate the position of a big  hole . some anomalous  is seen in this same direction on the low velocity side , but it is not clear whether this gas is originating from the hole .",
    "+ this slice shows that all the anomalous  complexes are in the direction of the inner bright optical disk ( r@xmath0 ) , while at larger radii the gas disk seems to be more quiet .",
    "this supports the galactic fountain hypothesis according to which massive star formation and supernovae are responsible for blowing the gas out of the disk . to further illustrate this",
    ", we have constructed a map of the anomalous , by integrating over velocities that differ more than a certain amount from normal galactic rotation .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "we find about @xmath1 m@xmath2 of  with velocities deviating more than @xmath3",
    "km / s from the local rotation .",
    "this is about 2% of the total  mass of ( @xmath4 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "+ clearly , nearly all the gas with velocities higher than 50 km / s is found in the direction of the bright optical disk ( which corresponds to the bright h@xmath5 distribution shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "this strongly suggests that star formation and high supernova rate are at the origin of the anomalous  and that the galactic fountain mechanism is responsible .",
    "+ however , fig .",
    "2 shows that some anomalous  is also found at the outer edges of the gas disk where there is little star formation going on . for this gas , therefore , it seems that a different explanation is needed .",
    "+      the middle and right panels of fig .",
    "2 show a few distinct clouds in the outer parts of the  disk of .",
    "one of them is associated with a hole in the outer disk ( fig 1 , bottom right panel ) . in this case ,",
    "star formation is unlikely to be the cause .",
    "this is reminiscent of the  hole and gas clouds found in m101 by @xcite . perhaps , as suggested for the m101 hole , also here a collision with a small companion galaxy or a dense gas cloud may have occurred .",
    "+ other indications of accretion in are noticable at low resolution . in fig .",
    "3 the disk shows a large plume at the northwestern side of the disk . the gas in this plume has the same velocity as the two companions at the same side of . a follow - up observation with the wsrt centered at a position between and the companions has not revealed any bridge between them .",
    "also the gas kinematics in the two dwarf galaxies seems unperturbed .",
    "therefore the gas in the plume is probably not originating from these companions .",
    "perhaps we are witnessing the accretion of a third companion .",
    "accretion phenomena seem to be common in galaxies ( van der hulst & sancisi , paper at this symposium ) .",
    "an example is the sagittarius dwarf in the milky way @xcite .",
    "is a barred sc galaxy in the sculptor group of galaxies , at a distance of 3.9 mpc .",
    "it is one of best nearby examples of a nuclear starburst galaxy .",
    "+ the high star formation rate in the inner parts of the disk makes an interesting case for the study of the galactic fountain phenomenon . the massive star formation and",
    "the related high supernova rate should blow a significant amount of gas out of the disk .",
    "+    our new , deep  observations of @xcite show that there is indeed  above the disk of this starburst galaxy . the total  distribution ( fig .",
    "4 , left panel ) shows plumes of extending 8@xmath6 to 11@xmath6 ( 9 to 12 kpc in projection ) from the midplane .",
    "the plumes straddle the extra - planar x - ray emission @xcite , and the diffuse h@xmath5 emission @xcite .",
    "+ the plumes are part of a larger complex of anomalous .",
    "this gas shows up clearly in the right panel of fig .",
    "4 as faint emission around the systemic velocity .",
    "this position - velocity diagram showing the overall kinematics of  in has been obtained by strip - integrating in the direction parallel to the minor axis .",
    "the anomalous halo gas is seen only at the northeastern side of the galaxy .",
    "+ we have separated the anomalous  from the normal , rotating  disk and found that it amounts to @xmath7 m@xmath2 of gas .",
    "this is about 3% of the total  mass of ( @xmath8 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "+ to investigate the characteristics of the anomalous gas , we have constructed models of the 3-d structure and kinematics of consisting of a thin  disk and a thick disk with different kinematics . from this",
    "we conclude that has a thick disk with a large , central cavity .",
    "this disk is only partly filled with , mostly in the ne , and rotates more slowly than the thin disk .",
    "the  plumes seen above and below the disk may be filaments or wall - like extensions of the ring to higher distances from the plane , brought up by the central superwind . + it is likely that , as already suggested for the x - ray and h@xmath5 , the origin of the extra - planar  is also related to the central starburst and to the active star formation in the central disk .",
    "alternatively , we may be seeing the effects of a minor merger and gas accretion . +",
    "and clearly are two more examples of galaxies with extra - planar .",
    "yet no consistent picture emerges and a number of processes may be at work . in both cases",
    "the data suggest a connection with the star formation in the disk . in this",
    "is more moderate but present over the entire disk . in",
    "this is more violent , especially in the inner region .",
    "it is not clear why the amount of gas in the halo are so different in the two galaxies . in the outer parts of",
    "we also find evidence for gas accretion .",
