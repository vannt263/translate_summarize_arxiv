    "the relevance of phonons for the low - energy properties of high - t@xmath3 oxides is presently rather controversially discussed .",
    "some experiments suggest that the charge carriers near the fermi surface interact only weakly with phonons .",
    "examples are the magnitude and temperature dependence of the resistivity @xcite and the rather small effects in the phonon spectrum caused in general by superconductivity near or below the transition temperature t@xmath3 @xcite . for instance , the superconductivity - induced softening and width of the zone - center buckling mode in yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 corresponds to a rather small electron - phonon ( ep ) coupling constant @xcite .",
    "the recently measured isotope dependence of angle - resolved photoemission spectra ( arpes ) @xcite do not indicate any isotope dependence of the total electronic band width for binding energies down to 200 mev .",
    "this shows the inapplicability of a simple polaron picture , caused by a strong ep interaction , to cuprates because the associated band narrowing would be sensitive to different isotopes @xcite .    on the other hand , there exist many observations which have been taken as evidence for a substantial ep interaction in the cuprates .",
    "the measured isotope effects on the transition temperature @xcite and the the superfluid density @xcite , especially in underdoped samples , are two examples .",
    "another example is the large width and softening observed in bond - stretching phonons in hole - doped cuprates in a very small region in @xmath7-space @xcite .",
    "similarly , the absence of a quasi - particle peak in strongly underdoped ca@xmath8na@xmath9cuo@xmath10cl@xmath4",
    "@xcite as well as the doping dependence of a magnetic transition in the frequency - dependent conductivity were attributed to phonons @xcite . finally , electronic self - energy effects in the phonon energy region have been observed by arpes @xcite and by scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite and interpreted in terms of a coupling of electrons to a bosonic mode . whether this mode is related to phonons",
    "is presently unclear but if this is the case the ep coupling and phonons would certainly be important for the low - energy physics of cuprates .",
    "unfortunately , there exists for virtually every interpretation of experiments in favor or disfavor of phonons alternative explanations .",
    "for instance , the large isotope effects on t@xmath3 observed in the underdoped region do not indicate necessarily a large ep coupling but may be caused by the pseudogap @xcite .",
    "similarly , the bosons which interact with electrons near the fermi surface in the interpretation of arpes data may be not phonons but , for instance , spin fluctuations @xcite . in view of these uncertainties",
    "it seems useful to investigate the properties of the ep coupling independently from any interpretation of experiments , i.e. , from first - principles using the local density approximation ( lda ) . to this end",
    "we extend recent investigations on phonon - induced electronic self - energy effects @xcite and study the momentum , frequency dependence and magnitude of the phonon - induced interaction between electrons in detail .",
