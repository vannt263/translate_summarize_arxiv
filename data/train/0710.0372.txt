    "the first galaxies and their environments differed substantially from those locally , often involving multiple interactions as seen in the _ hst _  ultra deep field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "compared to all other nearby environments , present - day compact galaxy groups most closely reproduce the interaction environment of the early universe ( @xmath5 ) when galaxies assembled through hierarchical formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and galaxy groups combined to form proto - clusters ( in dense regions ; e.g. , rudick+06 ) or massive ellipticals ( in the field ; white ) .    because of their high space densities ( with comparable surface densities to the centers of rich galaxy clusters ; e.g. , rubin+91 ) and low velocity dispersions ( @xmath6  ) , compact groups of galaxies are ideal environments for studying the mechanisms of interaction - induced star formation and nuclear activity . from optical spectroscopic surveys , hickson compact groups ( hcgs ) are known to host a population of galaxies with emission - line nuclear spectra characteristic of star - formation and/or active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "based on the optical spectroscopic survey of @xcite , the agn fraction in hcgs is found to be @xmath7 , perhaps consistent with the @xmath8 nuclear activity level found for nearby @xmath9 galaxies ( with greater detection sensitivity ; hoetal97a ) and significantly higher than the @xmath10 agn fraction identified optically in cluster galaxies ( with @xmath11 ; dressler85 ) .",
    "further , hcg agns ( including low - luminosity agns , hereafter llagns ; hcgs host no known seyfert  1-luminosity agns ) are preferentially found in optically luminous , early - type galaxies with little or no ongoing star formation in the cores of evolved groups .",
    "similarly , many galaxies in clusters host llagns in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in particular brightest cluster galaxies @xcite .    typically , the most active star - forming galaxies are late - type spirals in the outskirts of groups .",
    "@xcite interpreted relative distributions of star - forming and agn - hosting galaxies as indicating a clear evolutionary scenario whereby group cores are mature collapsed systems in which the high galaxy densities led to increased gravitational interactions and hence more rapid exhaustion of gas reservoirs in the past through star formation .",
    "( the radiatively weak agns in the evolved group cores require only a small amount of gas for fueling . )",
    "a similar study by @xcite found that the fraction of emission - line hcg galaxies was comparable to the field , and conversely concluded that the hcg environment does _ not _ trigger either star formation or agn activity .",
    "the initial expectation that the interactions evident in the compact group environment would naturally lead to markedly enhanced levels of star formation compared with the field has not been satisfied , and a coherent understanding of the history of gas and cold dust in compact groups has proven elusive .",
    "an analysis of the co content in hcg galaxies found them to be similar to those in the field , in loose groups , and in other environments ; a notable exception is the @xmath12 of hcg spirals that are co deficient .",
    "this suggests less , not more , star formation in hcgs compared to other environments @xcite . at the same time , the detection of a few hcg elliptical and s0 galaxies in both co and the far - infrared ( unlike typical galaxies of these types ) suggests that tidal interactions are influencing galaxy evolution to some extent . while the far - infrared power is similar to comparison samples , the ratios of 25 to 100  _ iras _  fluxes implies a greater number of intense , nuclear starbursts in hcg galaxies @xcite .",
    "clearly , a robust and consistent understanding of the impact of the compact group environment on galaxy properties has not yet emerged .",
    "one possible difficulty to date is the predominant use of optical emission - line studies to identify activity  both star - forming and accretion - dominated .",
    "ground - based studies of bright galaxies can easily obscure low - contrast emission lines through their dilution by a strong stellar contribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; intrinsic absorption can also mask spectroscopic signatures .",
    "the clear discrepancy between the @xmath10 agn fraction in galaxy clusters from optical spectroscopic surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) compared to the larger fraction ( @xmath13 for luminous galaxies ) revealed by x - ray observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is illustrative of this problem .",
    "as highlighted by @xcite , mismatched sample selection and detection techniques can create apparent ( and false ) discrepancies in agn fractions between environments .",
    "in this paper , we take an alternate approach , focusing on the mid - infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of individual galaxy nuclei to clearly identify the thermal , hot dust continua that signify neutral gas heated by ionizing photons from either young stars or an agn . the clear discrepancy between a blue",
    ", quiescent galaxy sed where the mid - infrared is dominated by the raleigh - jeans tail of stellar photospheres and the red , mid - infrared sed of warm to hot dust emission offers promise for reducing the ambiguity of previous compact group studies .",
    "* hereafter j07 ) have presented the first results from a cycle  1 _ spitzer _  irac ( 3.68.0 ) and mips ( 24 ) imaging survey of 46  galaxies in 12 nearby hcgs . in brief , this work revealed trends between the evolutionary states of compact groups ( determined from their dynamical and  masses ) , and their mid - infrared colors and luminosities .",
    "galaxies in relatively gas - rich groups tend to have colors most indicative of star formation and agn activity , and galaxies in gas - poor groups predominantly exhibit a narrow range of mid - infrared colors that are consistent with the light from quiescent stellar populations .",
    "the galaxies in this sample of 12 compact groups also occupy infrared color space in a distinctly different way than the population of galaxies in the _ spitzer _ first look survey ( fls ; e.g. , lacy04 ) , notably exhibiting a `` gap '' in their color distribution not found in the fls sample .",
    "all of these results suggest that the environment of a compact group is intimately connected to the mid - infrared activity of the member galaxies .",
    "we present additional analysis of the nuclei of these galaxies , focusing in particular on developing diagnostics for identifying quantitative measures of mid - infrared activity with the ultimate goal of exploring the nature of mid - infrared emission , i.e. , quiescent , star - forming , and/or accretion - powered .",
    "we also explore the connections between mid - infrared nuclear properties and other features of individual galaxies including morphology , optical spectral type , and the host group s evolutionary stage . because of their proximity ( @xmath14 )",
    ", we can spatially extract nuclear photometry for the hcg galaxies to reduce contamination from the extended galaxy that is inevitable in surveys of more distant galaxies .    throughout",
    "we assume a @xmath15-cdm cosmology with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18mpc@xmath19 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "target compact galaxy groups for the _ spitzer _  program were selected on the basis of distance , angular extent , and membership ( at least three members with accordant redshifts , i.e. , within 1000  of the group mean ) .",
    "all hcgs were considered at redshifts @xmath20 , and the sample includes all of the nearest ones with only a few exceptions  three nearby groups are too extended to realistically cover with small - field imagers .",
    "the morphologies of the individual galaxies in the groups include tidal arms and tails , polar rings , ellipticals with boxy isophotes and central disks , and disturbed features ; typical spiral and elliptical galaxies are also present . in table",
    "[ tab : groups ] , we list the groups , average recession velocities , membership by morphology , mass in neutral hydrogen ( @xmath21 ) , a qualitative description of the evolutionary stage of each group based on the scenario proposed by @xcite , and the  type from j07 .",
    "groups are divided into  types of i ( rich ; @xmath22 ) , ii ( intermediate ; @xmath230.9 ) , and iii ( poor ; @xmath24 ) , where @xmath25 is the group dynamical mass ( j07 and references therein ) .",
    "the observations and image reduction are described in detail in j07 , where the extended source photometry is presented .",
    "for this project , we focus on the nuclear regions in particular . the nuclear flux density is obtained using a circular aperture centered on the nucleus ( with some exceptions ; see below ) with a 7  radius which corresponds to 1.11.8  kpc for our groups .",
    "determining the absolute background in these crowded environments is not straightforward .",
    "we elected to use a uniform method in which background is taken from an annulus with inner and outer radii of 50  and 60 , respectively .",
    "this annulus is well outside the 3@xmath26 contour levels of nearly all of the galaxies in the sample with the exception of galaxies in close projected proximity with overlapping contours .",
    "however , since the mode of the annulus is used to determine the background level in all cases , partial contamination from a nearby source will not affect the measured background values .",
    "for the purposes of comparing photometry at different wavelengths , the irac and mips images were cross - convolved with their respective point response functions ( prfs ) to obtain images with matched spatial resolution .",
    "no aperture corrections have been applied . for reference",
    ", a 7  radius aperture corresponds to @xmath27 of the encircled energy of the 24  prf .    in most cases ,",
    "the nuclear aperture is centered on the location of the central flux peak of a galaxy . however , in the case of disrupted / merging / irregular galaxies , some discretion is required .",
    "for example , for the galaxies 31a , c , and e in hcg  31 , the infrared peak apparently at the galaxy collision interface is designated as the nucleus of the main interacting pair .",
    "the relative errors listed for the nuclear regions in table  [ tab : fluxes ] are conservatively set at 10% .",
    "the main source of relative uncertainty between the bands is the agreement of the relative astrometry ; this translates into how well - centered the nuclear region is in each band .",
    "empirically , this is found to be @xmath28 , and usually 23% .",
    "the formal uncertainties derived from the image statistics are negligible by comparison .",
    "this photometry procedure is different than the method used for the entire galaxies presented in j07 , which used isocontour levels . in some cases ,",
    "the flux density of the entire galaxy @xmath29 ( to roughly account for an aperture correction ) is actually less than the ` nuclear ' region , and this is because the isocontour levels used for the extended galaxy photometry fell within the 7  radius used for the nuclear regions .",
    "however , frequently the aperture - corrected flux of the nuclear region is essentially equal to that of the galaxy ; this indicates that at this angular resolution the galaxies are pointlike at 24 .",
    "the nuclear photometry from the near - infrared through 24  is presented in table  [ tab : fluxes ] .",
    "seds for each galaxy nucleus are plotted in rest - frame units in figure  [ fig : sed ] , along with the morphological type and optical spectroscopic classification ( as available ) .",
    "also overplotted is the total galaxy photometry and three sed templates , that of an elliptical galaxy @xcite , a type  1 ( i.e. , broad emission - line ) agn @xcite , and the local starburst galaxy m82 @xcite .",
    "these three templates encompass the range of expected mid - infrared spectral shapes for galaxies in the local universe . in general , the shape of the seds is comparable for the total galaxy and nuclear photometry .      to investigate nuclear activity in hcgs further , we calculate several values from the photometry to categorize the galaxies .",
    "first , we measure the luminosities at several wavelengths chosen to characterize the contribution from different emission mechanisms .",
    "the @xmath3-band luminosity , @xmath30 , is a measure of the luminosity in stars of a galaxy . unlike in previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that used a blue luminosity , @xmath31 , ongoing star - formation does not significantly alter @xmath30 .",
    "the luminosity at 4.5 , @xmath32 , measures the stellar continuum plus any contribution from hot ( @xmath33  k ) dust .",
    "this bandpass has the advantage of containing no significant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features .",
    "however , the stellar contribution can still be quite significant , and so we also calculate the fraction of 4.5  emission from hot dust : @xmath34@xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the light from stars expected from the elliptical galaxy template of @xcite normalized to the @xmath3 and @xmath37-band photometry .",
    "though not all galaxies in the sample are ellipticals , we use this template to represent the stellar population , as templates from spirals and irregulars will include warm dust emission .",
    "the @xcite elliptical template contains a contribution from cooler dust attributed to galactic cirrus , but this component is not significant for @xmath38 .",
    "additional fiducial luminosities are measured at 8 and 24 .",
    "the former includes pah emission ( if present ) , and the latter is sensitive to cooler dust in a frequency regime near the minimum of the elliptical galaxy template .",
    "the value , @xmath4 , the fraction of 24  luminosity not attributed to starlight , is calculated in the same manner as @xmath34 .",
    "finally , we also calculate the spectral index , @xmath1 , for a power - law model fit to the 4.58.0  data , @xmath39 .",
    "the 3.6  photometry is not included because of the dominant stellar contribution . in addition , an 8 to 24  spectral index , @xmath40=0.477@xmath41 , can reveal cooler dust or dust emission diluted by a strong stellar continuum at shorter wavelengths .",
    "all of these values are listed in table  [ tab : props ] .      in order to evaluate the role (",
    "if any ) of the hcg environment on mid - infrared activity , a comparison galaxy sample is required .",
    "for this purpose , we use the _ spitzer _  nearby galaxy sample ( sings ) photometry presented in @xcite .",
    "this is the largest sample of comparable _ spitzer _  data available in the literature for galaxies in the local universe with known distances .",
    "the sings sample was chosen to be diverse , covering a large parameter space of optical luminosities , masses , metallicities , star - formation rates , and morphologies . in an attempt to identify a reasonable comparison sample of galaxies within sings , we have filtered the sings sample to match the values of @xmath30(gal ) ( from j07 for the entire galaxy , not just the nucleus ) found in our sample , @xmath4230.17  hz@xmath19 .",
    "this leaves 61 out of the total sings sample of 75 .",
    "the majority of those filtered from the sings sample are low - luminosity dwarfs ; the hcg sample comprises primarily 35 bright galaxies per group .",
    "the distributions of @xmath30(gal ) for the hcg and sings samples are plotted in figure  [ fig : hists]a . for all of the sings galaxies , we use the photometry in tables  2 and 3 of @xcite and calculate the same parameters as for the hcg galaxies detailed in ",
    "[ sec : params ] .",
    "the extended source photometry for the hcg galaxies includes aperture corrections to correct for scattered light in the irac bands following eq .  2 of @xcite , and therefore the two datasets are directly comparable ( see j07 for further details ) .",
    "from a visual examination of the near through mid - infrared seds ( fig .  1 ) , the close correspondence of the @xmath3-band through 3.6photometric data points with an elliptical galaxy template indicates that stellar emission dominates in this wavelength regime in every galaxy . to account for this , we normalize a 13  gyr elliptical galaxy template @xcite to the @xmath3 and @xmath37 band flux densities . with this simple normalization ,",
    "the elliptical galaxy sed predicts the 3.68.0  flux densities for 21 of the 46  ( 46% ) galaxies remarkably well .",
    "these include the entire membership of the evolved and x - ray - bright hcgs 42 and 62 .",
    "the remaining 25 galaxies ( counting hcg  31ace as 3 galaxies ) , have mid - infrared continua that rise to longer wavelengths .",
    "this clear qualitative difference is illustrated quantitatively with the histogram of @xmath1  values shown in figure  [ fig : hists]b .",
    "no hcg galaxy nuclei inhabit the parameter space between @xmath1  values of @xmath43 and 0.25 ; for the integrated hcg galaxy seds , the distribution is comparable , with none found in the range of @xmath1(gal ) of @xmath43 to 0.12 .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the distribution of @xmath1  values of the sings galaxies ( plotted in the same figure ) that shows a significant fraction within the hcg gap .",
    "we also point out a noticeable peak near @xmath1@xmath44 for the sings galaxies whereas the hcg galaxies ( and nuclei ) are more evenly distributed from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "the larger number of hcg objects with @xmath1@xmath47 compared to sings galaxies likely reflects the larger number of early types in the former sample . however , morphological differences do not account for all of the discrepancy , as a direct comparison of the spirals in the two samples finds that while 11 of 47 ( 23% ) of the sings spirals have @xmath1  values in the range from 1.3 to 0 , none of the 17 hcg spirals do .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov analysis confirms the overall differences in the populations , giving only 0.12% and 0.35% probabilities that the sings galaxies are drawn from the same distribution as the hcg nuclei and galaxies , respectively .",
    "( the hcg nuclei and galaxies are consistent with eachother at 22.5% probability . )",
    "hereafter , we will utilize the break in the hcg @xmath1  distribution to distinguish `` mid - infrared active '' ( @xmath1@xmath48 ) from `` mid - infrared quiescent '' ( @xmath1@xmath49 ) nuclei and galaxies .",
    "we investigate this difference in more detail by plotting @xmath1  vs. @xmath50  for both the hcg and sings galaxies , coded by galaxy morphology in figure  [ fig : alphalum24 ] .",
    "it is perhaps most illuminating to compare the sings and hcg spiral galaxies ( @xmath51 symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphalum24 ] ) .",
    "while the two groups cover a comparable range of @xmath50 , the hcg galaxies are systematically redder in the mid - infrared , i.e. , with more negative values of @xmath1 . within the hcg galaxies , morphology is evidently a strong predictor of @xmath1 , with elliptical and s0 galaxies almost exclusively populating the parameter space of @xmath1@xmath47 .",
    "we next consider the utility of measuring @xmath34 , the fraction of @xmath32  attributable to non - stellar ( i.e. , hot dust ) emission .",
    "a plot of @xmath34  vs. @xmath52  shows a clear positive correlation in the hcg population , with higher values of @xmath52  corresponding to larger values of @xmath34 , as shown in figure  [ fig : fracd]a .",
    "this correlation is highly significant according to the non - parametric spearman s @xmath53 test which gives a probability , @xmath54 , of @xmath55 for @xmath56 that these parameters are uncorrelated .",
    "while the hcg nuclei known to have optical absorption - line spectra ( filled circles ) all have values of @xmath34@xmath57 consistent with purely stellar emission and @xmath52@xmath58  hz@xmath19 , there is no clear separation in this parameter space between galaxies identified as agns or star - forming .",
    "this is perhaps surprising , as one might expect agns to have larger values of @xmath34  than star - forming galaxies because of the typically hotter temperatures of dust emission associated with harder ionizing continua .",
    "this is true even for seyfert  2 galaxies that are typically assumed to have intrinsic absorption that blocks the direct line of sight to the accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one source of hot dust emission in star - forming galaxies that may contribute significantly at @xmath59  is from dust shells around agb stars , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the five known low - ionization nuclear emission region ( liner ) galaxies ( open squares ) , which can be powered by either star - formation or accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , also do not lie in a distinct region within this parameter space .",
    "the recent mid - infrared spectroscopic survey of @xcite found two distinct liner populations separable by infrared luminosity ; the two populations can be divided at @xmath60@xmath61  ( where @xmath62 is integrated from 81000 ) . in brief , infrared emission lines ,",
    "continuum shape , and pah features indicate that infrared - luminous liners are more closely linked to starburst galaxies , while infrared - faint liners were identified primarily with agns",
    ". however , the presence of high ionization lines such as [ ] seems to indicate that as many as 90% of all liners in their sample contain agns , though accretion power is not energetically dominant in the majority of cases .",
    "the two liners in our sample with no evidence for mid - infrared activity , 42a and 62a , are known x - ray sources , and therefore likely do host agns .",
    "their low mid - infrared luminosities and weak emission - line signatures in the optical indicate that the agns are not particularly powerful .",
    "given that their values of of 4.0@xmath63 and 6.6@xmath63@xmath61   are also the two lowest in the sample , they might be identified with the infrared - faint liners of @xcite .",
    "the other three ( 16a , 16d , and 90d ) may therefore be star - formation powered , though this remains ambiguous without mid - infrared spectra .",
    "focusing on longer wavelengths , three galaxies show evidence for dust emission at 24  that is not evident when only considering the irac data .",
    "in particular , a plot of @xmath40  vs. @xmath4  reveals a clear separation between galaxies at @xmath4@xmath64 , see figure  [ fig : fracd]b . with only one exception ( 62d ) ,",
    "all known hcg absorption - line galaxies have @xmath4@xmath65 and @xmath40@xmath66 .",
    "none of the identified star - forming galaxies is in that region , while two liners ( 42a and 62a ) and one optical agn ( 22a ) are . while all of the galaxies identified as mid - infrared - active from their values of @xmath1@xmath67 have @xmath40@xmath68 and @xmath4@xmath69 , an additional three galaxies , the seyfert  2s 16b and 61a and the absorption - line galaxy 62d , appear as 24-excess sources .",
    "an examination of their mid - infrared seds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) indicates that these galaxies likely include a strong contribution from stellar photospheric emission throughout most of the irac bands , and only at 24 , near a minimum of the elliptical template sed , is there sufficient contrast to see the low - luminosity dust continuum .",
    "hereafter , we designate all sources with @xmath4@xmath70 and @xmath40@xmath68 as `` 24-active '' .    combining diagnostics of mid - infrared and 24  activity , @xmath40  vs. @xmath1",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : alphas ] , coded by both  richness ( as listed in column  9 of table  [ tab : groups ] ) and galaxy morphology . in this plot , it is clear again that all nuclei designated as mid - infrared - active are also 24-active , though the converse is not true for three objects .",
    "the dashed line represents @xmath1=@xmath40 , and the elliptical galaxy nuclei ( with the exception of 62d ) are all tightly clustered near this line .",
    "these objects are also typically in -poor groups .",
    "nuclei from each of the most -rich ( type  i ) groups , 2 , 16 , 31 , and 61 , have the most negative ( reddest ) @xmath1  values .",

    "considering only mid - infrared - active galaxies , the correlation is less significant ( @xmath73 ; @xmath74 ) , though still present .",

    "( of these , 90bd and 31ace were unresolved in the radio images . ) in a plot of @xmath75 vs. @xmath50 , the most mid - infrared luminous nuclei have large amounts of @xmath75 , however , there is quite a large scatter as shown in figure  [ fig : gas]b . in fact ,",
    "not all mid - infrared luminous galaxies have large @xmath75 reservoirs .",
    "however , more complete and deeper molecular gas surveys are needed to explore this relationship in further detail .",
    "given the proximity of our targets , the _ spitzer _",
    "angular resolution offers a handle on investigating the difference between nuclear and integrated galaxy parameters for identifying potential nuclear activity .",
    "this is particularly relevant for survey work , where more distant objects are typically unresolved with _",
    "spitzer_. using the criterion that values of @xmath1@xmath48 indicate mid - infrared activity , the galaxy and nuclear data for the hcg sample are completely consistent ( see figure  [ fig : hists]b ) . at longer wavelengths , however , there are some discrepancies . in particular , @xmath4@xmath70 as the discriminant for a 24  excess yields some differences depending on whether the integrated galaxy light or nuclear light is considered .",
    "though all galaxies with @xmath4@xmath76 also have @xmath4@xmath77 , four additional galaxies  7b , 42a , 42b , and 90b  have 24  excesses in their integrated galaxy light .",
    "this is also evident from visual inspection of their seds as plotted in figure  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "the values of @xmath4  of the integrated galaxy vs. nuclear light are shown in figure  [ fig : galnuc ] .",
    "the four discrepant galaxies are all early type ( sb0 , e3 , sb0 , and e0 , respectively ) ; the 24  excess is thus evidence of low - level star formation occurring outside of the nuclei in these galaxies .",
    "if such objects were at a much greater distance such as typical of large area surveys , the corresponding lack of spatial resolution could therefore lead to inaccuracies in the nuclear classification based on mid - infrared data alone .",
    "no activity would be missed , but some objects would be classified as 24-  active ( and therefore potentially hosting llagns ) where extranuclear star formation is in fact responsible .",
    "of the complete set of 46  hcg galaxies presented in the _ spitzer _ imaging survey of j07 , we have identified 25 with red ( @xmath1@xmath48 ) mid - infrared continua .",
    "all eight known , spectroscopically identified star - forming galaxies ( 7a , 16c , 19c , 22c , 31ace , and 31b ) are within this group .",
    "an additional three galaxies ( 16b , 61a , and 62b  all optically identified agns ) are apparently quiescent in the irac bands but show evidence for a 24-excess above a stellar continuum , bringing the total number of 24-active hcg galaxies to 61% ( as all of the mid - infrared active galaxies are also 24-active ) .",
    "this is higher than the fraction of emission - line galaxies ( including agns and star - forming galaxies ) identified in optical spectroscopic surveys of hcgs @xcite , and highlights the utility of multiwavelength studies to capture all activity .    though the mid - infrared analysis presented here has the advantage of being unambiguous in terms of identifying mid - infrared activity",
    " the distribution of hcg nuclei is clearly bimodal in terms of both @xmath1  and @xmath4   distinguishing between accretion and star formation as the dominant source of mid - infrared power remains challenging .",
    "the evident trend in figure  [ fig : alphalum24 ] between @xmath1  and @xmath50  seen in mid - infrared active galaxy nuclei could be interpreted as an increasing contribution from star formation at higher @xmath50  and redder ( more negative ) values of @xmath1 .",
    "establishing this would be extremely powerful for interpreting photometric data of fainter objects in wide field surveys .",
    "however , the significant correlation between @xmath34  and @xmath52 , which might similarly be read to imply a stronger agn component ( because of the greater hot dust contribution at 4.5 ) at larger values of @xmath52 , is not generally consistent with the known nuclear identifications from optical spectroscopy .",
    "this implies that simple measures of the steepness of the mid - infrared continuum are not diagnostic  underscoring the difficulty of using mid - infrared photometry alone to categorize objects .",
    "even with high signal - to - noise mid - infrared spectroscopy , the underlying source of mid - infrared power can remain ambiguous in some objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the strong stellar contamination at 3.6  in all of these galaxies means that color - color diagnostics that use the ratio of 3.6 to 4.5fluxes to isolate agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) likely miss a large fraction of them , particularly at lower infrared luminosities .",
    "selection criteria with a wider dynamic range in color will be less sensitive to this effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , as noted by j07 , none of our sample would fulfill the agn mid - infrared color - color selection criteria of @xcite or @xcite , which were designed to target objects where the agn dominates the mid - infrared sed .",
    "our entire sample would also fail the power - law agn selection criterion of @xcite that required a monotonic flux increase from 3.6 to 8.0 .",
    "a few optically identified llagns ",
    "22a , 42a , and 62a  show no evidence for any excess mid - infrared ( including 24 ) emission , indicating that warm to hot dust emission does not always accompany accretion onto a black hole",
    ". however , without a reservoir of cold material , an optically detectable agn may be short - lived . in any case",
    ", such a system is unlikely to contribute significantly to the luminous energy budget of its host galaxy . given their weak emission lines ( which would be strongly diluted by host galaxy light at larger distances ; moran02 ) , these three galaxies may be identified with the optically dull but x - ray detected agns found in clusters @xcite .",
    "the evolved nature of their host groups and the x - ray detections of 42a and 62a in particular are consistent with identifying these systems as mini - clusters . in contrast , the less evolved compact groups may be less likely to host x - ray bright , optically quiet galaxies , as found in the loose group survey of @xcite . at present",
    ", the lack of a complete suite of optical spectroscopy and high quality x - ray observations of our galaxy sample complicates definitively fitting the compact groups in context with the agn surveys in the loose group and cluster environments done to date .",
    "the striking difference between the distribution of @xmath1  values for the hcg and sings galaxies supports the role of environment in affecting hcg galaxies  a conclusion consistent with the marked difference in the mid - infrared color - color distribution of hcg and fls galaxies noted by j07 .",
    "in particular , the strongly bimodal nature of hcg nuclear ( and galaxy ) @xmath1  values as well as the correlation between group  content and 24  activity suggests that star formation in a compact group galaxy , likely induced by interactions , occurs in a burst that then exhausts its reservoir of cold gas , as suggested previously from far - infrared @xcite and optical spectroscopic @xcite studies .",
    "the end result is a group dominated by mid - infrared quiescent galaxies .",
    "if local compact galaxy groups are analogous to the building blocks of clusters in the early universe , this implies that the exhaustion of cold gas through enhanced star - formation occurs as a result of interactions ( though not necessarily mergers ) prior to cluster infall .",
    "any agn activity in those galaxies at that point would proceed in a low - luminosity , x - ray bright mode @xcite .",
    "however , tully - fisher @xcite and fundamental plane studies @xcite of hcg galaxies reveal that they are consistent with control galaxy populations .",
    "therefore , there is no strong evidence for a significant effect of the compact group environment on the current states of galaxy morphology in such a significant way that would alter the end states of galaxy evolution .    from a stellar population study of hcg ellipticals",
    ", @xcite concluded that these galaxies showed evidence for truncated star formation in comparison to a ( very small ) sample of field ellipticals .",
    "while this may be the case , the mechanism for star formation truncation is unlikely to be extensive feedback from agn activity .",
    "none of the optically known agns in any hcg has sufficient luminosity to clear a galaxy of its interstellar medium .",
    "the sole possible exception to this observation is 62a , where x - ray cavities in the intragroup medium suggest that a relativistic jet has ejected a sigificant amount of kinetic energy from a radiatively quiet agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , this ongoing process likely postdates the epoch of star formation in this evolved group .",
