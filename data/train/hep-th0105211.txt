    "there has long been an interest in the magnetic monopoles that arise as classical solutions in certain spontaneously broken gauge theories .",
    "when the theory is quantized , these give rise to magnetically charged particles that can be regarded as the counterparts of the electrically charged elementary quanta of the theory . in certain supersymmetric theories ,",
    "these two classes of particles are believed to be related by an exact duality symmetry @xcite .    when the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken , the gauge bosons corresponding to the generators of the unbroken subgroup remain massless .",
    "if the unbroken subgroup contains a non - abelian factor , some of these massless gauge bosons transform nontrivially under the gauge group and thus carry an `` electric '' charge .",
    "duality suggests that these should have massless magnetically - charged counterparts . although these can not be realized as isolated classical solutions , evidence for their existence can be found by analyzing multimonopole solutions . in this paper",
    "we will investigate some of the properties of these massless monopoles by examining the role that they play in low energy scattering processes .",
    "recall that an arbitrary magnetically charged bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) @xcite solution can be naturally understood as being composed of a number of fundamental monopoles of various types @xcite .",
    "if the gauge symmetry @xmath4 is broken to an abelian subgroup u(1)@xmath5 , as happens for generic choices of the adjoint higgs vacuum expectation value , there is an integer - valued topological charge for each u(1 ) factor .",
    "associated to each of these is a fundamental monopole carrying a single unit of that topological charge .",
    "each of these fundamental monopoles can be realized as a classical solution by embedding the unit su(2 ) monopole solution in an appropriate subgroup of @xmath4 .    for the special choices of the higgs vacuum expectation value that give a non - abelian unbroken subgroup , the bps mass formula implies that some of the fundamental monopoles should become massless .",
    "although the corresponding embedding solutions reduce to pure vacuum solutions in this limit , analysis of multimonopole solutions suggests that the collective coordinates of the massless fundamental monopoles survive as degrees of freedom . examining static classical solutions with magnetic charges corresponding to a sum of massive and massless monopoles",
    ", one finds that the massive monopoles are surrounded by one or more `` clouds '' of non - abelian field @xcite .",
    "the number of collective coordinates @xcite needed to describe these clouds is exactly equal to the number that one would have attributed to the massless monopoles .    to make these ideas more concrete ,",
    "consider the case of an su(@xmath0 ) gauge theory with an adjoint higgs field whose asymptotic value ( in some fixed direction ) can be brought into the form @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "the asymptotic magnetic field in the same direction can be written as @xmath8 , where the magnetic charge @xmath9 is of the form @xmath10 the @xmath11 are all integers , and give the number of fundamental monopoles of the various types .",
    "the mass of the @xmath12th species of fundamental is proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "hence , if the @xmath14 are all distinct , so that the symmetry is broken maximally , to u(1)@xmath15 , the @xmath16 species of fundamental monopoles are all massive .",
    "if @xmath17 of the @xmath18 are equal , there is an enlarged unbroken symmetry , with @xmath19 of the u(1 ) factors being replaced by an su(@xmath20 ) .",
    "we will focus on solutions containing one of each species of monopole , with @xmath21 .",
    "the unbroken group is then u(1)@xmath1su(@xmath2)@xmath1u(1 ) , and our solutions contain two massive and @xmath3 massless monopoles .",
    "this example has two advantages for us .",
    "first , a number of analytic results about the static solutions and their moduli space are already known .",
    "second , because the two massive monopoles correspond to commuting su(2 ) subgroups of the su(@xmath0 ) , they can have no direct interactions .",
    "any interaction between them must be due to the mediation of the massless monopoles , and thus can give us insight into the properties of the cloud .",
    "explicit solutions for an su(@xmath0 ) theory with the @xmath11 all equal to unity were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . for either type of symmetry breaking ,",
    "these solutions are described by @xmath22 collective coordinates .",
    "when the fundamental monopoles are all massive , these have a natural interpretation as the spatial coordinates , @xmath23 , and u(1 ) phases of the @xmath16 constituent monopoles ; as long as the separation between the monopole positions is large compared to the monopole core sizes , the multimonopole nature of the configuration is evident in the classical solution . as the higgs field approaches the value corresponding to the non - abelian breaking , monopoles 1 and @xmath16 , which remain massive , clearly retain their identity .",
    "has @xmath24 and corresponds to an su(2 ) embedding in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 rows and columns of the su(@xmath27 matrices .",
    "] however , the @xmath3 monopoles that become massless are replaced by a single cloud surrounding the massive monopoles ; this cloud can be viewed as being formed by the merger of the cores of the massless monopoles . inside this cloud ,",
    "the magnetic field is approximately equal to the the coulomb field appropriate to the charges of the massive monopoles ; it has both abelian and non - abelian components . outside the cloud ,",
    "the coulomb component of the magnetic field is purely abelian , with the non - abelian contributions falling with a higher power of distance .",
    "the size of this cloud is characterized by a `` cloud parameter '' @xmath28 that is equal to the sum of the separations @xmath29 between the monopoles .",
    "any value @xmath30 , the separation of the two massive monopoles , is possible , and the static energy is independent of @xmath28 .",
    "all other trace of the massless monopole positions appears to be lost in this limit . in particular",
    ", the fields show no special behavior at the @xmath23 corresponding to the massless monopoles .",
    "in fact , any change in these `` positions '' that leaves @xmath28 invariant can be compensated by a gauge transformation of the solution .",
    "our goal in this paper is to gain further insight into the nature of these massless monopoles by examining the role that the cloud plays in monopole scattering .",
    "to do this we use the moduli space approximation @xcite , which reduces the dynamics of the infinite number of field degrees of freedom to that of a finite number of collective coordinates @xmath31 .",
    "the lagrangian for this reduced set of variables can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a naturally defined metric on the moduli space of solutions .",
    "the evolution of the collective coordinates is simply geodesic motion in this metric .",
    "when the monopoles are all massive , this reduction to a finite number of degrees of freedom fits quite well with the point of view that particles arising from classical soliton solutions should be seen as having a similar status to those arising as quanta of the elementary fields , and that the solutions with higher charge should be interpreted as multiparticle states .",
    "when some of the monopoles become massless , the classical solutions lose their manifest multiparticle nature . nevertheless , the massless monopole collective coordinates survive ( although with their physical interpretations modified ) and the moduli space lagrangian has a smooth limit  @xcite , provided that the total magnetic charge is abelian .    the moduli space approximation is usually expected to be valid in the limit of small monopole velocities .",
    "this ensures that the monopole kinetic energy is small enough that the excitation of the nonzero - frequency modes of the massive fields is energetically suppressed .",
    "although simple energetic arguments are not sufficient to rule out excitation of any massless fields that might be present , more detailed analysis @xcite shows that the approximation holds if the long - range fields are all abelian .",
    "as we will see , the situation with massless non - abelian fields is more complex .    to use the moduli space approximation",
    ", we need the metric on the space of multimonopole solutions .",
    "the exact form of this metric is known for only a relatively few cases .",
    "however , these include @xcite the case where there is at most one of each species of fundamental monopole , which is precisely what we need . unfortunately , the form of this metric that was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite was expressed in terms of the positions and u(1 ) phases of the @xmath34 individual monopoles .",
    "although these are the natural coordinates to use when the monopoles are all massive , they are much less useful in the limit we are interested in , where the massless monopole positions have little direct physical meaning .",
    "a more natural set of coordinates would include the positions and u(1 ) phases of the two massive monopoles , the cloud parameter @xmath28 , and the parameters needed to specify the global su(@xmath2 ) orientation of the cloud .",
    "thus , our first task is to change to a new set of variables .",
    "we do this in two steps . in sec .",
    "ii we transform to an intermediate set of coordinates that allows us to separate the metric into two parts , one that gives the terms in the lagrangian containing @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and an `` angular '' part that contains the entire dependence on the spatial and gauge orientation angles and phases . the natural next step would be to relate these intermediate coordinates to the spatial euler angles and their gauge counterparts .",
    "this turns out to be somewhat nontrivial .",
    "however , we can bypass this step by rephrasing the problem in terms of the corresponding angular momenta and charges .",
    "we do this in sec .",
    "iii , leaving the discussion of the euler angles to the appendix . with these results in hand",
    ", we are then ready to determine the geodesics of the metric and the behavior of the monopoles in scattering processes .",
    "this is described in sec .",
    "we summarize our results and make some concluding remarks in sec .",
    "the moduli space of solutions for a system comprising two distinct fundamental monopoles was obtained in ref .",

    "@xcite it was shown that when the @xmath41 symmetry is broken to u(1)@xmath1su(@xmath2)@xmath1u(1 ) this metric can be written as @xmath42 ^ 2       + \\kappa \\sum_a   \\left[\\frac{1}{r_a }        d{\\bf r}_a^2 + r_a ( d\\psi_a+\\cos\\theta_ad\\phi_a)^2\\right ]      - \\lambda         \\left[\\sum_a r_a\\,(d\\psi_a+\\cos\\theta_ad\\phi_a)\\right]^2 \\label{rametric}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are the spherical coordinates of the vector @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the reduced mass of the two massive monopoles , and @xmath48   \\ , \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath49 ( with @xmath50 the gauge coupling of the theory ) is the magnitude of the fundamental monopole magnetic charge , while @xmath51 is approximately equal to the sum of the core radii of the two massive monopoles .",
    "the difficulty with using this expression for our purposes is that , as we noted in sec .",
    "i , the positions of the massless monopoles do not have any direct physical meaning .",
    "we would therefore like to transform to a more physically meaningful set of variables .",
    "this set should include the cloud parameter @xmath28 and the spherical coordinates @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 of the vector @xmath55 that gives the relative separation of the two massive monopoles , but must also include the relative u(1 ) phase and a number of su(@xmath2 ) orientation angles .",
    "one might expect that @xmath56 $ ] such angles would be needed to specify the gauge orientation of the solution . for @xmath57",
    "this would require more collective coordinates than are available .",

    "first , there does not appear to be any particular striking effect when @xmath174 . because @xmath52 is by definition positive , @xmath35 changes sign , but",
    "the magnitude of @xmath35 varies continuously .",
    "similarly , @xmath235 shows no unusual behavior when @xmath52 vanishes .",
    "all this is consistent with our expectations ; since the two massive monopoles have no direct interactions , they should be able to pass through each other with little effect .",
    "by contrast , each of the massive monopoles does interact directly with one of the massless monopoles comprising the cloud .",
    "this might suggest that there should be a noticeable effect when a massive and a massless monopole position coincide ; i.e. , when @xmath178 . on the other hand , the massless monopoles are hardly point particles , since the entire cloud region can be viewed as being composed of the massless cores .",

    "note also that the effect of these massive - massless `` collisions '' seems to be greatest when they occur at small @xmath28 and @xmath52 .",
    "this is perhaps clearest in the trajectories where the interaction is strong enough to reverse the direction of motion of the massive monopoles , so that @xmath174 twice . in these cases ,",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath52 coincide when @xmath52 is so small that the two massive cores overlap each other .    even when the massive monopoles do not change direction , we can gauge the strength of their interaction with the cloud by the amount of energy transferred between the cloud and the massive monopoles . in fig .",

    "figure  3 should be compared with fig .  4 , where we we plot the minimum value of @xmath28 as a function of @xmath220 .",
    "we see that the largest energy transfers are associated with small values of @xmath28 , and that the energy transfer decreases as @xmath242 increases for @xmath243 . in fig .",

    "1 and 2 are qualitatively quite similar .",
    "we again find that @xmath238 is small when the cloud parameter @xmath28 achieves its minimum size , and the greatest amount of energy transfer between the cloud and the massive monopoles occurs when @xmath242 is small .",
    "one notable difference is found in those @xmath248 solutions where the massive monopoles reverse direction .",
    "in contrast with the @xmath239 case , the massive monopoles need not be overlapping at the time of this reversal .",
    "this is readily understood .",
    "because the cloud energy is so much greater than the massive monopole energy , relatively little energy transfer is required to reverse the sign of @xmath35 , and so @xmath28 at the time of the collision can be larger than it was in the previous case .",

    "previous studies of static bps solutions have shown that these massless monopoles coalesce into a cloud of non - abelian field surrounding one or more massive monopoles . in the scattering solutions that we have studied ,",

    "first , there are some geodesics that start in one leg of the figure , cross the line of trigonometric solutions and begin to move down another leg , and then , after crossing the line of hyperbolic solutions , cross a second line of trigonometric solutions and exit via third leg .",
    "these may be viewed as analogous to the su(@xmath2 ) scattering solutions in which the two massive monopoles reverse direction . as with the latter solutions , these `` three - leg trajectories '' are found only if the massive monopoles are sufficiently close in the minimal cloud configuration ; in other words , if the trajectory goes too far down the second leg , the massive monopoles can not reverse direction .",

    "ahead of the front , the evolution of the fields is much slower , consistent with a slow linear growth of the cloud at a rate fixed by the initial value of @xmath256 .",

    "eventually @xmath256 will become of order unity , but since @xmath259 when this happens , the moduli space approximation should continue to give a good description of the subsequent motion of the massive particles .",
    "thus the main modification to our picture is that the velocity of the cloud asymptotically approaches unity , rather than increasing without bound .    in the other case ,",
    "the initial low - energy configuration approximates a solution with large cloud that is contracting with the magnitude of @xmath256 being of order unity .",

    "thus , it would be of great interest to study the bps and near - bps states containing massless and massive elementary particles with non - abelian charge with the aim of identifying the counterparts of the cloud parameter @xmath28 or of the asymptotic separation of the energy between the cloud and the massless monopoles .          a natural set of parameters is the cloud size @xmath28 ; the massive monopole separation @xmath52 ; three spatial euler angles @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath262 ; three internal su(2 ) euler angles @xmath263 , @xmath210 , and @xmath264 ; and the relative u(1 ) phase @xmath265 .",
    "this is a total of nine but , as we discussed in sec .  2",
    ", we only expect eight parameters .",
    "we will see later that this conflict is resolved by the identification of a spatial euler angle with one of the internal su(2 ) euler angles .",
    "the @xmath266 transform as doublets under both the spatial and the internal su(2 ) , with the upper and lower indices being spatial and internal , respectively .",
    "hence the @xmath266 for arbitrary values of the spatial euler angles must be of the form @xmath267 where @xmath268 and @xmath269 are functions of @xmath28 , @xmath52 , @xmath265 , and the internal euler angles .",
    "we choose a parameterization of @xmath270 such that @xmath271 where @xmath272 similarly , @xmath268 and @xmath269 can be written as linear combinations of @xmath273 with coefficients that depend only on @xmath52 , @xmath28 , and @xmath265 . by performing a gauge rotation , we can make @xmath268 proportional to @xmath274 .",
    "we then have @xmath275    the 2 relative phases among @xmath276 and @xmath277 can be absorbed in redefinitions of @xmath264 and @xmath262 .",
    "then , by a redefinition @xmath278 , @xmath279 and @xmath280 , we can make the @xmath281 all real and non - negative .",
    "equations  ( [ rfromz ] ) and ( [ bfromz ] ) then give the constraints @xmath282 these are solved by @xmath283 , @xmath284 , @xmath285 .",

    "this is a manifestation of the axial symmetry of this configuration : for any spatial axial rotation that changes the parameter @xmath262 , one can do an opposite axial gauge rotation that changes @xmath264 , so that the metric is invariant .",
    "there are several interesting limits of this metric .",
    "if the relative distance between the two massive monopoles @xmath291 and the relative u(1 ) charge @xmath152 both vanish , it reduces to the metric for one massive and one massless monopole in so(5 ) @xcite : @xmath292 . \\label{so5metric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the limit where we have minimal cloud @xmath178 and vanishing internal su(2 ) charges , we get the metric for two distinct massive su(3 ) monopoles @xcite . the angles @xmath262 and @xmath264 can be absorbed into a redefinition of @xmath265 , and we obtain @xmath293 + \\frac{\\kappa^2}{2 } \\frac{r}{\\kappa+\\mu r } ( -d\\chi+\\cos\\theta\\ , d\\phi)^2 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can also consider the limit where @xmath47 is much greater than both @xmath294 and the initial energy of the cloud . to leading order , the massive monopole motion decouples from that of the cloud , and we may set @xmath295 . making the change of variables @xmath296 and @xmath297 , we get the eguchi - hanson @xcite metric .",

    "in order to study the classical dynamics for the general case with nonzero angular momenta and internal charges , it is most convenient to first eliminate the redundant parameters .",
    "this can be done , e.g. , by simply choosing @xmath300 .",
    "we then write the angular part of the metric as @xmath301 where the @xmath302 ( @xmath303 ) are one - forms expressed in terms of the various rotational and gauge angles .",
    "these satisfy an algebra of the form @xmath304 where the @xmath305 are antisymmetric in @xmath306 and @xmath12 .",
