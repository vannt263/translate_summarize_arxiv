    "a plethora of observations concur that the universe at present enters a phase of accelerated expansion .",
    "in fact , most cosmologists accept that over 70% of the universe content at present corresponds to the elusive dark energy ; a substance with pressure negative enough to cause the observed acceleration @xcite .",
    "the simplest form of dark energy is a positive cosmological constant @xmath0 , which however , needs to be incredibly fine - tuned to explain the observations @xcite .",
    "this is why theorists have looked for alternatives , which could explain the observations while setting , as was originally assumed .",
    "a promising idea is to consider that the universe at present is entering a late - time inflationary period @xcite .",
    "the credibility of this option is supported also by the fact that the generic predictions of inflation in the early universe are in excellent agreement with the observations .",
    "the scalar field responsible for this late - inflation period is called quintessence because it is the fifth element after baryons , photons , cdm and neutrinos @xcite .",
    "since they are based on the same idea , it is natural to attempt to unify early universe inflation with quintessence .",
    "quintessential inflation was thus born @xcite .",
    "this attempt has many advantages .",
    "firstly , quintessential inflation models allow the treatment of both inflation and quintessence within a single theoretical framework .",
    "also , quintessential inflation dispenses with the tuning problem of the initial conditions for quintessence . finally , unified models for inflation and quintessence are more economic because they avoid introducing yet another unobserved scalar field .    for quintessential inflation to work one",
    "needs a scalar field with a runaway potential , such that the minimum has not been reached until today and , therefore , there is residual potential density , which can cause the observed accelerated expansion .",
    "string moduli fields are suitable because they are typically characterised by such runaway potentials .",
    "the problem with such fields , however , is how to stabilise them temporarily , in order to use them as inflatons in the early universe . in this work ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) we achieve this by considering that , during its early evolution our modulus crosses an enhanced symmetry point ( esp ) in field space . when this occurs the modulus",
    "is trapped temporarily at the esp @xcite , which leads to a period of inflation .",
    "after inflation the modulus picks up speed again in field space resulting into a period of kinetic density domination ( kination ) @xcite .",
    "kination ends when the thermal bath of the hot big bang ( hbb ) takes over . during the hbb , due to cosmological friction @xcite , the modulus freezes at some large value and",
    "remains there until the present , when its potential density dominates and drives the late - time accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "is is evident that , in order for the modulus to become quintessence , it should not decay after the end of inflation . reheating ,",
    "therefore should be achieved by other means .",
    "we assume that the thermal bath of the hbb is due to the decay of some curvaton field @xcite as suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite . by considering a curvaton",
    "we do not add an _",
    "ad  hoc _ degree of freedom , because the curvaton can be a realistic field , already present in simple extensions of the standard model ( e.g. a right - handed sneutrino @xcite , a flat direction of the ( n)mssm @xcite or a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson @xcite possibly associated with the peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite ) .",
    "apart from reheating , the curvaton can provide the correct amplitude of curvature perturbations in the universe .",
    "consequently , the energy scale of inflation can be much lower than the grand unified scale @xcite .",
    "in fact , in certain curvaton models , the hubble scale during inflation can be as low as the electroweak scale @xcite .",
    "string theories contain a number of flat directions which are parametrised by the so - called moduli fields , which correspond to the size and shape of the compactified extra dimensions .",
    "many such flat directions are lifted by non - perturbative effects , such as gaugino condensation or d - brane instantons @xcite .",
    "the superpotential , then , is of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2  const .",
    "is the tree level contribution from fluxes , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are constants and @xmath5 is a khler modulus in units of @xmath6 .",
    "hence , the non - perturbative superpotential @xmath7 results in a runaway scalar potential characteristic of string compactifications . for example , in type iib compactifications with a single khler modulus , @xmath8  re(@xmath5 ) is the so - called volume modulus , which parametrises the volume of the compactified space . in this case",
    ", the runaway behaviour leads to decompactification of the internal manifold .",
    "the tree level khler potential for a modulus , in units of @xmath9 , is @xmath10 and the corresponding supergravity potential is to secure the validity of the supergravity approximation and we have assumed that the esp lies at a minimum in the direction of im(@xmath5 ) . ]",
    "@xmath11    to study the cosmology , we turn to the canonically normalised modulus @xmath12 which , due to eq .",
    "( [ tree ] ) , is associated with @xmath13 as @xmath14    suppose that the universe is initially dominated by the above modulus . the non - perturbative scalar potential in eq .",
    "( [ vnp ] ) is very steep ( exponential of an exponential ) , which means that the field soon becomes dominated by its kinetic density .",
    "once this is so , the particular form of the potential ceases to be of importance . to achieve inflation",
    "we assume that , while rolling , the modulus crosses an esp and becomes temporarily trapped at  it .",
    "in string compactifications there are distinguished points in moduli space at which there is enhancement of the gauge symmetries @xcite .",
    "this results in some massive states of the theory becoming massless at these points .",
    "even though from the classical point of view an esp is not a special point , as the modulus approaches it certain states in the string spectrum become massless @xcite . in turn , these massless modes create an interaction potential that may drive the field back to the symmetry point . in that way a modulus can become trapped at an esp @xcite .",
    "the strength of the symmetry point depends on the degree of enhancement of the symmetry .",
    "such modulus trapping can lead to a period of so - called ` trapped inflation ' @xcite , when the trapping is strong enough to make the kinetic density of the modulus fall below the potential density at the esp .",
    "however , it turns out that the number of e - foldings of trapped inflation can not be very large . therefore , with respect to cosmology , the main virtue of the esps relies on their ability to trap the field and hold it there , at least temporarily .    because esps are fixed points of the symmetries we have @xmath15 where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath12 and @xmath16 is the value of the modulus at the esp .",
    "the above means that the esp is located either at a local extremum ( maximum or minimum ) or at a flat inflection point of the scalar potential , where . this means that the presence of an esp deforms the non - perturbative scalar potential ( see fig .",
    "[ esp ] ) .",
    "this deformation may be enough so that , after trapped inflation , the field undergoes slow - roll inflation over the flat region of the scalar potential at the vicinity of the esp .",
    "the total duration of inflation may , thus , be enough to solve the flatness and horizon problems of the hbb .",
    "let us briefly study the trapping of the modulus at the esp .",
    "we assume that around the esp there is a contribution to the scalar potential due to the enhanced interaction between the modulus @xmath12 and another field @xmath17 , which we take to be also a scalar field @xcite .",
    "the interaction potential is @xmath18 where @xmath19 with @xmath20 being a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "thus , at the esp the @xmath17 particles are massless .",
    "the time dependence of the effective ( mass)@xmath21 of the @xmath17 field results in the creation of @xmath17-particles .",
    "this takes place when the field is within the production window @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the kinetic density of the modulus when crossing the esp and the dot denotes derivative with respect to the cosmic time  @xmath24 .",
    "the effective scalar potential near the esp is @xmath25 where @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the ` background ' scalar potential . following ref .",
    "@xcite we have @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes the number density of @xmath17 particles produced after the crossing of the esp .",
    "this means that @xmath30 and the field climbs a _ linear _ potential since @xmath29 is constant outside the production window .",
    "after the first crossing , the field reaches the amplitude @xmath31 , determined by its initial kinetic density . to avoid overshooting the esp we require @xmath32 since for larger values the coupling softens @xcite . after reaching @xmath31 , the field reverses direction and crosses the production window again , generating more @xmath17 particles and , therefore , increasing @xmath33 .",
    "thus , it now has to climb a steeper potential reaching an amplitude @xmath34 .",
    "the process continues until the ever decreasing amplitude becomes comparable to the production window ( see fig .",
    "[ trap1 ] ) . at this moment",
    "particle production stops .",
    "after the end of particle production , @xmath35 remains roughly constant during an oscillation and the modulus continues oscillating in the quadratic interaction potential .",
    "studying this oscillation , we found that , due to the universe expansion , the amplitude and frequency decrease as @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite , where the scale factor @xmath38 is normalised to unity at the end of particle production .",
    "hence , the quadratic potential becomes gradually `` diluted '' due to the universe expansion ( see fig .",
    "[ trap2 ] ) .",
    "the above mean that the kinetic density of the oscillating modulus scales as .",
    "when @xmath39 becomes redshifted below @xmath40 , trapped inflation begins .",
    "the above process assimilates a multitude of initial conditions ( provided overshooting the esp is avoided ) because any kinetic density in excess of @xmath40 is depleted before the onset of trapped inflation .",
    "trapped inflation dilutes exponentially the density of the @xmath17particles , which quickly redshifts @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , after a rather limited number of e - foldings of trapped inflation , the modulus is released from the esp .      since the esp is located at a locally flat region of the potential there is a chance that , after @xmath41 becomes negligible , the modulus drives a period of slow - roll inflation while sliding away from the esp . to study this period we need to quantify the deformation of the scalar potential due to an esp .",
    "the appearance of an esp generates either a local extremum or a flat inflection point at @xmath16 . in all cases , in the vicinity of the esp",
    ", the scalar potential can be approximated by a cubic polynomial@xcite .",
    "hence , the characteristics of the potential depend only on @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , we can parametrise the deformation of the scalar potential using @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the hubble parameter during inflation : @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath48 parameter accounts for the strength of the symmetry point ; the smaller the @xmath48 , the stronger the deformation and the wider the inflationary plateau .",
    "the requirement that the deformation becomes negligible at distances larger than @xmath6 results in the lower bound @xmath49 , which also guarantees that the modulus does not overshoot the esp @xcite .    by studying inflation after the modulus escapes trapping",
    ", we have obtained the following results , depending on the esp morphology @xcite . in each case",
    ", one has to achieve enough inflationary e - folds to solve the horizon and flatness problems , while also taking care that the curvature perturbations due to the modulus are not excessive compared to observations .",
    "consider first the case of a flat inflection point . in this case",
    ", we can have enough e - foldings of slow roll inflation if @xmath50 .",
    "the case of a local minimum is indistinguishable from the above if @xmath51 .",
    "if the opposite is true then the modulus becomes trapped in the local minimum and must escape through tunnelling . afterwards",
    "the modulus can drive a period of slow - roll inflation with total number of e - foldings given by @xmath52 .",
    "hence , to solve the horizon and flatness problems we need @xmath53 .",
    "finally , in the case of a local maximum , after the end of trapping , one can have a phase of fast / slow roll inflation provided @xmath54 .",
    "thus , we have found that , in all cases , _ enough slow - roll inflation to solve the horizon and flatness problems of the hbb is attainable provided _ @xmath55 .",
    "choosing for illustrative purposes an intermediate value for the hubble scale : @xmath56  tev we have found that one can achieve enough inflationary e - foldings ( up to @xmath57 ) without producing excessive curvature perturbation if @xmath58 .",
    "thus , _ there is ample parameter space for slow - roll inflation to occur after the modulus escapes trapping at the esp_. note also , that , while @xmath46 is determined by the location of the esp in field space ( by the vacuum density @xmath40 ) , the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 are due to the deformation of the scalar potential at the vicinity of the esp which is not directly related to @xmath40 . hence , the requirement that the latter are smaller than @xmath46 does not necessarily imply fine - tunning .",
    "after inflation , the field rolls away from the esp .",
    "soon the influence of the esp on the scalar potential diminishes and @xmath61 . the steepness of @xmath62 results in the kinetic domination of the modulus density . as a result a period of kination occurs , during which the field equation is : @xmath63 .",
    "hence , the density of the universe scales as @xmath64 @xcite . during kination ,",
    "the scalar field is oblivious of the particular form of the potential .",
    "kination is terminated when the density of the decay products of a curvaton field dominates the kinetic density of the modulus @xcite .",
    "thus , the end of kination corresponds to reheating , with reheating temperature @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the hubble parameter at reheating .    after the onset of the hbb , the rolling scalar field is subject to cosmological friction @xcite , which asymptotically freezes the field at the value @xmath67 . note that this value depends on @xmath68 which , in turn , is determined by curvaton physics .",
    "the modulus remains frozen until the present when it plays the role of quintessence .",
    "this guarantees that there is no dangerous variation of fundamental constants during the hbb .",
    "the evolution of the modulus until today is depicted in fig .",
    "since @xmath69 , the modulus rolls to large values before freezing . at such values",
    "we can assume that the scalar potential is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a density scale and @xmath72 .",
    "the above is a typical uplift potential introduced by flux compactifications as discussed below .",
    "if the modulus is to account for the required dark energy , it must satisfy the coincidence requirement : @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the dark energy density parameter and @xmath75 is the critical density at present .",
    "hence , @xmath76 thus , the density scale @xmath71 is determined by @xmath68 which , in turn , is determined by curvaton physics .",
    "an upper bound on @xmath71 is obtained by demanding that reheating occurs before big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) : @xmath77 where @xmath78  mev is the temperature at bbn .    the scalar potential in eq .",
    "( [ exps ] ) may have a multitude of origins .",
    "for example , using the volume modulus , we may consider a stack of @xmath79branes located at the tip of a klebanov - strassler throat .",
    "the uplift potential is @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 , in the warp factor , are the units of rr and ns three - form fluxes . to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ cbound ] ) we must have @xmath83",
    ". this can be attained by choosing the ratio of fluxes as @xmath84 .",
    "taking @xmath85 , only twice as many units of @xmath82 flux as those of @xmath81 flux are needed .",
    "it is also possible to consider fluxes of gauge fields on @xmath86branes @xcite . in this case , the scalar potential obtains a contribution @xmath87 where @xmath88 depends on the strength of the gauge fields considered .",
    "the constraint in eq .",
    "( [ cbound ] ) requires now @xmath89  tev .",
    "the future of the modulus after unfreezing depends on the steepness of the scalar potential , or equivalently the value of @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ exps ] ) .",
    "@xmath91 for @xmath92 , the modulus dominates the universe for ever , leading to eternal acceleration .",
    "this results in future horizons , which pose a problem for the formulation of the s - matrix in string theory @xcite .",
    "@xmath91 for @xmath93 , the modulus dominates the universe but results only in a brief accelerated expansion period .",
    "such is the fate of the @xmath94 case .",
    "@xmath91 for @xmath95 , the modulus does not dominate the universe , albeit causing a brief period of accelerated expansion . afterwards",
    "the modulus density remains at a constant ratio with the background matter density .",
    "this is the fate of the @xmath96 case .",
    "@xmath91 for @xmath97 , the modulus does not cause any accelerated expansion and so can not be used as quintessence .",
    "after unfreezing , the modulus rolls fast down the quintessential tail of the scalar potential with its density approaching asymptotically kinetic domination ( and subsequently freezing at a value larger than @xmath98 @xcite ) .",
    "this case corresponds to @xmath99 .",
    "the brief acceleration period caused by the unfreezing modulus is due to the fact that the modulus oscillates around an attractor solution @xcite , which in itself does not result to acceleration @xcite . in ref .  @xcite it was claimed that brief acceleration occurs if @xmath100 , which corresponds to the range @xmath101 .",

    "@xcite , where it is shown that brief acceleration can explain the observations at least up to .",
    "since the data are interpreted using a number of priors , we believe that the @xmath96 case is still marginally acceptable .",
    "quintessential inflation is possible to achieve in string theory with flux compactifications using as inflaton a string modulus which rolls down its runaway potential .",
    "inflation is due to the presence of an enhanced symmetry point ( esp ) , which traps the modulus and creates a locally flat region over which the modulus can slow - roll .",
