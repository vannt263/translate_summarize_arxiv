    "angular correlations among jets produced in association with scalar bosons and massive gravitons have been the subject of several studies  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that experimental determination of such correlations can give us important information about the spin and cp - properties of these particles .",
    "for example , by studying the distribution of azimuthal angle difference between two tagging jets ( @xmath12 ) in the gluon fusion ( gf ) production of a scalar ( @xmath13 ) or pseudo - scalar ( @xmath14 ) higgs with two jets , it has been shown that the cp - odd and cp - even higgs can clearly be discriminated at the lhc .",
    "it has also been shown that for jets produced with massive gravitons ( g ) , the @xmath12 distribution is flat while the sum of the azimuthal angles show a characteristic distribution  @xcite .",
    "it was further demonstrated analytically in ref .",
    "@xcite that these angular correlations arise from the quantum interference of different helicity states of the intermediate vector bosons , which can either be a weak boson or a gluon .",
    "another critical observation made in ref .",
    "@xcite is that the amplitudes for @xmath15  jets production can be approximated by those of the vector boson fusion ( vbf ) sub - processes when a specific set of kinematic cuts are applied , where the two tagging jets are demanded to be in the opposite hemispheres of the detector and also to be well separated in rapidity ( the so called vbf cuts ) , and in addition their transverse momenta are subjected to a slicing cut , restricting them to be sufficiently low as compared to the h / a / g masses .",
    "we note in passing that another complementary method of determining the spin and cp information of new particles is from their decay patterns ( for example , the decay of a higgs boson to a pair of gauge bosons ) , which has also been widely discussed in the literature  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study heavy quark pair @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) production at the lhc in association with two jets , and study the azimuthal angle correlations among these jets .",
    "our goal is to predict the jet angular correlations for the sm processes by using the same approximation , so that the experimental technique to measure the new particle properties via initial state radiation patterns can be established using the ample sm processes .",
    "we first calculate the helicity amplitudes for gluon fusion processes initiated by @xmath18 initial states at the lhc leading to @xmath19  jets production . here",
    ", we work in the limit in which the intermediate gluons are collinear to the initial partons .",
    "we work out the angular correlations using the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite , and then verify our approximate analytical results in several kinematic regions by comparing them with the exact parton level matrix elements in the tree level .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the helicity formalism used to obtain our analytical results . in section 3",
    "we give the spin summed matrix - element squared for @xmath20  jets production via gluon fusion in the collinear limit for the exchanged gluons , and then analyze the results in two different kinematic limits , namely that of the @xmath3 production threshold ( @xmath21 ) in which the invariant mass of the @xmath22 pair , @xmath23 , is very close to @xmath24 , and that of the relativistic limit where @xmath25 is much higher than @xmath26 , for @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in section 4",
    "we show the exact numerical results for these angular correlations at parton level , where the expected azimuthal angle correlations are reproduced once appropriate final state selection cuts are applied .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in section 5 .",
    "the helicity amplitude formalism for vector boson fusion processes has been discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of production and decay of a heavy particle in association with two jets .",
    "we follow the same notations and conventions in this paper . the inclusive process , @xmath29 can proceed , via gluon fusion , through the sub - processes @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is one of the three possible initial states @xmath32 , @xmath33 is a @xmath28-channel intermediate gluon and @xmath34 stands for a quark or anti - quark of any flavour :    [ eq1 ] @xmath35    in addition to gluon fusion , the above sub - processes receive contributions from all other diagrams at the same order in perturbation theory to make a gauge - invariant physical amplitude .",
    "however , in this and the next section , we shall consider only the gluon fusion diagrams .",
    "as mentioned earlier , it has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that after applying the vbf selection cuts , the gf contribution can be made to dominate the total cross - section .",
    "we shall also show the validity of this approach by first determining analytically the distributions predicted by the gf diagrams in various kinematic limits , and then comparing them with the exact matrix elements .    to begin with ,",
    "we define a common set of kinematic variables for the @xmath36 sub - processes in eqn .",
    "[ eq1 ] as    @xmath37    the helicities of the quarks or anti - quarks have the value @xmath38 while for on - shell gluons they take the values @xmath39 .",
    "the helicity amplitudes for this process can be written as @xmath40 where the external quark or gluon currents are denoted by @xmath41 , and the gluon propagator is given by @xmath42 for the conserved currents @xmath43 we note in passing that the conditions in eqn .",
    "[ eq : curr - consv ] are satisfied not only for massless quark currents but also for the gluonic currents , in the processes ( 2b ) and ( 2c ) in the light - cone gauge  @xcite .",
    "the real gluon approximation to the amplitudes ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : ampl ] ) is obtained by replacing the off - shell @xmath44 amplitudes by the on - shell , and hence gauge - invariant @xmath45 amplitudes @xmath46 while keeping the four - momenta of the @xmath16 system and the orientation of the colliding virtual gluon momenta in the @xmath47 rest - frame . the full amplitudes for the process ( 3 )",
    "are now approximated as @xmath48 where the incoming current amplitudes are given by    @xmath49    it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the helicity dependent phases of the above current amplitudes reproduce azimuthal angle correlations among the jets while their magnitudes give the well - known dglap splitting functions when squared and summed over helicities .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we define the reduced current amplitudes @xmath50 as follows    @xmath51    where @xmath52 and the coupling factor @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 for quark or anti - quark currents , and @xmath55 for gluon currents . here , @xmath56 is the qcd coupling constant , while we suppress the colour indices in the helicity amplitudes of eqn .",
    "[ eq : ampl ] for brevity .",
    "the reduced current amplitudes @xmath50 have been computed and tabulated in ref .",
    "@xcite , to which we refer the reader for details .",
    "however , it might be worth recalling some of the salient features of these reduced current amplitudes .",
    "first of all , the reduced amplitudes for anti - quark currents are same as those of quark currents . and since we neglect light quark masses , by chirality conservation , the helicity - flip amplitudes will be zero for quark currents , i.e. , @xmath57 , while this is not the case for gluon current amplitudes .",
    "the existence of helicity - flip amplitudes in gluon currents give rise to certain special features in the amplitudes for @xmath19  jets involving them .",
    "it is useful to look into the current amplitudes from the point of view of parton branching  @xcite , whereby the outgoing partons are emitted collinearly . in the current amplitudes @xmath58 or @xmath59 ,",
    "if @xmath60 is the energy fraction of the initial parton that is carried away by the off - shell gluon , then one can write the current amplitudes in terms of the energy fractions of the two t - channel gluons , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and the azimuthal angles of the outgoing partons @xmath63 and @xmath64 , in the frame in which the t - channel gluons are taken as propagating along the @xmath65-axis .",
    "let us first fix the reference frame in which we shall be working . as mentioned above",
    ", we take this frame to be the centre of mass frame of the two t - channel gluons producing the @xmath16 pair , which is also the rest frame of the @xmath16 pair . in this frame",
    ", the two gluons can be taken to be propagating in opposite directions along the @xmath60-axis with energy @xmath66 each . therefore , the scattering process",
    ", @xmath67 can be assumed to be taking place in the @xmath68 plane . here ,",
    "@xmath69 denote the colour indices for the gluons and @xmath70 denote the colour indices for the quark and the anti - quark .",

    "the helicity amplitudes for the process @xmath45 can be expressed in the following form : @xmath77_{i,{\\overline{i } } } \\mathcal{\\hat{n}}_{\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2}^{\\sigma \\bar{\\sigma}}\\right]~. \\label{eq - amp - ggqq}\\ ] ] one can further simplify eqn .",

    "the squared matrix element ( averaged over initial state and summed over final state colour ( c ) and spin ( s ) ) can be obtained by using eqns .",
    "[ eq - gen - form ] ,  [ eq - amp - ggqq ] ,  [ eq - hel - amp ] , and the current amplitudes @xmath81 as tabulated in ref .",

    "the co - efficients @xmath87 s in the above expression are functions of @xmath88 , the energy fractions of the initial partons carried away by the t - channel intermediate gluons . for notational convenience ,",
    "let us also define @xmath89 . here",
    "@xmath63 and @xmath64 are the azimuthal angles of the two outgoing partons ( jets ) in the @xmath16 rest frame whose polar axis is chosen along the virtual gluon momentum as defined in sub - section  [ sec : gg - qq ] . in the collinear limit , these azimuthal angles reduce to the standard ones in the lab frame with polar axis along the beam direction .",
    "for definiteness , we take the heavy quark q ( q = b or t ) momentum to have zero azimuthal angle .",

    "furthermore , in the amplitudes involving gluon currents ( i.e. , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 initiated processes ) , there is an additional singularity as @xmath104 ( i.e. , @xmath105 ) .",
    "this happens because not only the intermediate gluons can become soft , but now an outgoing gluon jet can become soft as well . since the form of @xmath98 and @xmath99 are identical for all of the @xmath82 and @xmath2 collision processes , and these functions",

    "we shall see that the ratio of @xmath106 or @xmath99 to @xmath90 determines how strong the azimuthal correlations will be .",
    "we now explore the two different kinematic limits in which one obtains characteristic strong azimuthal angle correlations that can be probed at the lhc .",

    "we would like to point out that in the production of a cp - odd scalar boson in association with 2 jets one expects a similar distribution in @xmath110 .",
    "the second kinematic region of interest is the relativistic limit in which the @xmath16 pair invariant mass is very high , such that the masses of the heavy quarks can be ignored . in this limit , as @xmath117 , @xmath118 .",

    "the exact matrix elements were calculated with the help of madgraph 5  @xcite at parton level .",
    "subsequently , both the exact and approximate matrix elements were integrated over the relevant four - body phase - space using the bases  @xcite monte - carlo integration package . note that , we do not include the effects of parton shower in this study .",
    "we have used the cteq6l1  @xcite parton distribution functions with lo running of @xmath127 , and @xmath128 . for the factorization scale",
    "we choose the minimum value of transverse momenta demanded for the tagging jets ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "the strong coupling constant @xmath127 is evaluated at the corresponding minimum transverse energy of the final state partons or heavy quarks , i.e. , for the @xmath116  jets process , we take @xmath130 , while for @xmath124   jets it is taken to be @xmath131 . in our analysis , @xmath132 is taken as @xmath133 ( see cut-3 below ) .",

    "we have subjected the tagging jets to a slicing @xmath144 cut , and have also demanded a high value for the minimum energy of the jets . since we want to isolate the contribution of the gf diagrams to the full process , we also need to impose the so - called vbf cuts , which require the two tagging jets to reside in the opposite hemispheres of the detector and to be well separated in pseudorapidity .",
    "the vbf cuts imposed in our study are as follows :    * cut-2 * :  @xmath145 ,  @xmath146 .",
    "in addition to the above cuts on the tagging jets , we also impose a set of cuts on the @xmath28 and @xmath147 quarks .",
    "we demand a minimum transverse energy ( @xmath148 ) for the @xmath147 quarks , such that @xmath149 is always higher than the tagging jet @xmath144 s .",
    "also , the @xmath28 and @xmath147 quarks are required to be in the central region of the detector .",
    "these cuts are summarized below :    * cut-3 * :  @xmath150 ,  @xmath151    in figure  [ fig : fig-1 ] , we show the differential distributions obtained using the exact matrix elements for both the azimuthal angle difference of the two tagging jets , @xmath110 , and the sum of the azimuthal angles @xmath120 in @xmath116  jets events , for the sub - processes initiated by @xmath152 and @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , we show the sum of all sub - process contributions , too . in order to obtain the azimuthal angle distributions in the threshold limit",
    ", we need to ensure that the invariant mass of the @xmath3 system , @xmath153 , should be very close to @xmath154 .",
    "therefore , in this figure , we have imposed an invariant mass cut of @xmath155 .",
    "as explained in sub - section 3.1 , we indeed see a distribution resembling the behaviour predicted by eqn .",
    "[ eq : thres ] .",
    "in particular , we see the expected suppression at @xmath111 , and enhancement at @xmath112 . on the otherhand , the @xmath156 distribution is observed to be rather flat , as expected in this region of @xmath153 .",
    "this agreement between the analytic approximation and the exact numerical evaluation shows the usefulness of the vbf cuts in selecting the gf contribution to the total cross - section . in order to estimate the feasibility of studying the angular distributions in the @xmath116  jets process at the @xmath126 lhc",

    "in this paper , we have studied the azimuthal angle correlations of jets produced in association with a top or bottom quark pair at the lhc .",
    "we have presented the helicity amplitudes for the process @xmath19  jets using only the gluon fusion diagrams and employing the on - shell gluon approximation to the matrix element .",

    "the other kinematic limit considered is the relativistic limit , in which @xmath76 is very much higher than @xmath159 . in this limit , while the distribution in @xmath110 is expected to be rather flat , there is a strong correlation in the sum of the azimuthal angles , @xmath120 .",
    "we performed an exact numerical evaluation of these angular distributions in @xmath116  jets and @xmath124  jets processes at the lhc , including all the diagrams at the tree level , and verified our analytical approximations using a suitably devised set of kinematic selection cuts .",
    "the vbf selection cuts are found to efficiently select the gf contribution to these processes .",
    "a comparison between the normalized differential distributions obtained by using the exact and the approximate matrix elements also shows a very good agreement between the two .",
    "the total cross - sections are overestimated by the approximate matrix elements by about a factor of 2 , while they approach the exact cross - sections as the @xmath144 s of the tagging jets are demanded to be smaller , thereby achieving the collinear limit for the t - channel intermediate gluons , in which our approximation approaches the exact matrix elements .",
    "we expect these azimuthal correlations calculated at the leading order to survive even after including higher order corrections , as has been previously demonstrated in the case of higgs production with multiple hard jets  @xcite .",
    "one particular future direction that can be explored is to extend our parton level results by using a matrix elements matched with parton shower method .",
    "we would like to stress that the study of such angular correlations among jets produced with a top or bottom quark pair is not only interesting in itself , it has useful implications in the study of vbf processes for determining the spin and cp properties of new particles which can be discovered at the lhc . in particular , the experimental technique to measure such correlations between tagging jets",
    "can be established first by using these sm processes which have sufficiently high cross - sections .",

    "<S> angular correlation of jets produced in association with a massive scalar , vector or tensor boson is crucial in the determination of their spin and cp properties . </S>",
    "<S> we study jet angular correlations in events with a high mass bottom quark pair or a top quark pair and two jets at the lhc , whose cross - section is dominated by the virtual gluon fusion sub - processes when appropriate kinematic selection cuts ( vector - boson fusion cuts ) are applied . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate helicity amplitudes for sub - processes initiated by @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions in the limit where the intermediate gluons are collinear to the initial partons . </S>",
    "<S> we first obtain a general expression for the azimuthal angle correlations among the dijets and @xmath3 or @xmath4 , in terms of the @xmath5 or @xmath4 helicity amplitudes in the real gluon approximation of the full matrix elements , and find simple analytic expressions in the two kinematic limits , the production of a heavy quark pair near the threshold , and in the relativistic limit where the invariant mass of the heavy quark pair is much larger than the quark mass . for @xmath6  jets we find strong azimuthal angle correlations which are distinct from those expected for events with a cp - even or odd scalar boson which may decay into a @xmath4 pair . for @xmath7  jets </S>",
    "<S> we find that the angular correlations are similar to that of a cp - odd scalar@xmath8  jets near the threshold @xmath9 , while in the relativistic limit they resemble the distribution for @xmath6  jets . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations in the standard qcd processes will help establish the experimental technique to measure the spin and cp properties of new particles produced via gluon fusion at the lhc .     </S>",
