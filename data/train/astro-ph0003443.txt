    "the physical natures , evolutionary states , and circumstellar disks of classical t tauri stars are becoming better understood due to recent spectroscopic observations , high resolution imaging , and advances in the theory of pre - main - sequence ( pms ) evolution .",
    "however , the natures of the central stars and inner circumstellar environments of protostars are still not very well known .",
    "this is primarily because they are so heavily extinguished that they are difficult to observe even with modern instruments and detectors .",
    "for example , it is not known whether the central stars in protostellar objects differ substantially in effective temperature , radius , or rotation properties from classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) .",
    "the presence of protostellar envelopes , significantly higher accretion rates , and more powerful outflows suggest that the photospheres of protostellar cores may indeed be physically different from cttss .",
    "moreover , it is not known whether the physical natures of protostellar photospheres are consistent with the predictions of protostellar evolution and pms stellar theory .",
    "flat - spectrum and class i young stellar objects ( ysos ) are the best low - mass protostellar candidates for spectroscopic study because they have relatively well - developed central stars and are detectable at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "several pioneering studies have recently been undertaken to begin investigating the physical natures of these objects .",
    "a few flat - spectrum protostars have been observed in low resolution spectroscopic surveys and thus far they appear to be characterized by late - type photospheres with high continuum veilings and sub - giant surface gravities ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) .",
    "even fewer have been observed at high spectroscopic resolution , and these observations suggest that the flat - spectrum protostars rotate significantly faster than the more evolved cttss ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "these investigations have provided some interesting clues to the natures of these objects , but more observations are clearly needed to make sense of these late - phase protostars .",
    "it would be most interesting to determine if the less evolved , more heavily embedded and veiled class i protostars also show near - ir photospheric absorption lines when observed at high resolution with high signal - to - noise . such observations could directly constrain the effective temperatures , gravities , veilings , and rotations of these objects , providing further evidence as to whether they are dominated by near - ir stellar , disk , or envelope emission and whether they are physically similar to flat - spectrum ysos .",
    "more flat spectrum ysos should also be observed with high - resolution near - ir spectroscopy to confirm that they are indeed late - type rapid rotators . in a sense",
    "the flat - spectrum ysos provide a link to the well - known pms stars , and this must be better developed so that they can in turn serve as a link to the less well - known class i objects .",
    "therefore we have undertaken a new high - resolution , near - ir spectroscopic study of flat - spectrum and class i ysos in the @xmath2 ophiuchi cloud core .",
    "we describe these new observations in  2 and present a rotation and veiling analysis of these data in  3 . in ",
    "4 we discuss the likely natures of each of these objects and suggest further observational work .",
    "near - ir spectra were acquired in 1997 may  june and 1998 july with the 3.0 m nasa infrared telescope facility on mauna kea , hawaii , using the cshell facility single - order cryogenic echelle spectrograph @xcite .",
    "spectra were acquired with a 10 ( 5 pixel ) wide slit on the dates indicated in table 1 , providing a spectroscopic resolution @xmath9 = 21,000 ( 14 km s@xmath7 ) .",
    "the spectrograph was fitted with a 256 @xmath10 256 pixel insb detector array , and custom circular variable filters ( cvfs ) manufactured by optical coating laboratories incorporated were used for order sorting .",
    "these filters successfully eliminated the significant interference fringing normally produced in cshell and other echelle spectrographs which use cvfs for order sorting .",
    "the plate scale was 020 pixel@xmath7 along the 30@xmath11 long slit ( oriented east  west on the sky ) , and all spectra were acquired at a central wavelength setting of 2.29353 @xmath12 m corresponding to the v = 0  2 co band head .",
    "each exposure had a spectral range @xmath13 ( @xmath14 700 km s@xmath7 ) .",
    "total integration times for each yso are given in table 1 .",
    "data were acquired in pairs of exposures of up to 400 s duration each , with the telescope nodded @xmath15 east or west between exposures so that object spectra were acquired in all exposures .",
    "the b0v star hr 6165 ( @xmath16 sco ) was observed periodically for telluric corrections .",
    "the telescope was guided with the cshell internal ccd autoguider during exposures of these telluric correction stars , while the telescope tracking rates were adjusted for minimum drift while observing the optically invisible @xmath2 oph ysos .",
    "spectra of the internal cshell continuum lamp were taken for flat fields , and exposures of the internal cshell ar and kr lamps were used for wavelength calibrations .",
    "all data were reduced with iraf .",
    "first , object and sky frames were differenced and then divided by flat fields .",
    "next , bad pixels were fixed via interpolation , and spectra were extracted with the apall task .",
    "extracted spectra were typically 5 pixels ( 1 ) wide along the slit ( spatial ) direction at their half - intensity points .",
    "spectra were wavelength calibrated using low - order fits to lines in the arc lamp exposures , and spectra at each slit position of each object were co - added .",
    "instrumental and atmospheric features were removed by dividing wavelength - calibrated object spectra by spectra of early - type stars observed at similar airmass at each slit position .",
    "final spectra were produced by combining the spectra of both slit positions for each object .",
    "the object sample was selected from the class i and flat - spectrum ysos observed at low spectral resolution ( @xmath17 ) in paper i which were not subsequently observed at high spectral resolution in paper ii .",
    "none of the newly observed sources ( listed in table 1 ) showed any absorption features in their low resolution @xmath3-band spectra ( paper i ) , and they are also relatively bright , 7 mag @xmath18 10 mag .",
    "table 1 shows that the brighter point sources ( i.e. elias 29 , irs 54 ) were observed with higher signal - to - noise ratios than the fainter ones ( i.e. irs 43 , wl 6 ) .",
    "this is useful for analyzing the veiling in these objects if the brightness differences among the sources are mostly due to different amount of ir excess emission from circumstellar regions .",
    "if this is true , then the brighter objects have greater near - ir veiling and greater signal - to - noise is required to detect their photospheric absorption lines . on the other hand , it may be possible that some of the bright protostars are featureless because they are of relatively early spectral type ( g or earlier ) and possess intrinsically weak @xmath3-band absorption lines ( besides h and he ) .",
    "the new flat - spectrum and class i yso spectra are shown in figures 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "none of the five class i spectra show any evidence of co absorption .",
    "two of the flat - spectrum ysos also show no evidence of any co absorption ( gss 26 and ylw 13b ) , while the other two show evidence of weak , broad band heads and perhaps some overlapping rotation - vibration lines as well ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we now analyze these spectra to constrain the veilings and physical natures of these sources . our previous high resolution study ( paper ii )",
    "showed that late - type class ii ysos ( pre - main - sequence stars ) rotate slowly , @xmath19 km s@xmath7 , while flat - spectrum ones rotate quickly , @xmath20 km s@xmath7 .",
    "this study also showed that in addition to broadening the band head , high rotation also decreased the maximum absorption depth of the band head and adjacent individual rotation - vibration lines .",
    "thus rotation as well as veiling can reduce the detectability of co absorption in finite signal - to - noise spectra .",
    "we now explore the limits of @xmath3-band veiling and rotation in our new protostar sample by comparing their spectra to those of flat - spectrum and class ii ysos to which we have artificially added continuum veiling .",
    "we chose vssg 25 to be representative of a slowly rotating class ii yso ( @xmath5 sin @xmath21 km s@xmath7 ) and vssg 17 to be representative of a quickly rotating ( @xmath5 sin @xmath22 km s@xmath7 ) flat - spectrum source ( see paper ii ) .",
    "the spectral types and @xmath3-band veilings have been measured for both of these objects .",
    "vssg 25 has a spectral type m0iv / v with @xmath23 = 0.25 @xcite while vssg 17 is m0iv / v with @xmath23 = 0.9 ( @xcite ; paper i ) .",
    "the @xmath3-band veiling is defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the @xmath3 band excess flux , and @xmath26 is the @xmath3 band stellar flux .",
    "we added veiling ( a constant positive offset ) to the template spectrum of vssg 17 ( taken from paper ii ) and degraded its signal - to - noise so that its co absorption equivalent width and detectability were weakened .",
    "we then used a series of these vssg 17 templates with various veilings and signal - to - noise ratios to estimate the veilings of our observed sources .",
    "we estimated the veiling for sources which show co band head absorptions ( irs 51 and irs 63 ) by matching their spectra to veiled templates with identical signal - to - noise and similar features ( co band head depth and slope ) .",
    "the band head profiles of these objects also matched the shape of vssg 17 and matched those of observed slowly rotating late - type stars which had been artificially broadened with a stellar rotation profile of @xmath5 sin @xmath27 km s@xmath7 ( see paper ii ) .",
    "thus it is likely that their co absorptions arise in rapidly rotating stellar photospheres .",
    "however , the absorption features of these highly veiled sources are very weak , and this limits the derived rotation velocities to uncertainties of approximately 40% and the derived veilings to uncertainties of at least 20% .",
    "the minimum likely veilings of the class i and flat - spectrum sources without detectable co absorptions were estimated by assuming that their co absorptions were intrinsically similar to vssg 17 but had increased continuum veiling .",
    "we derived an analytical relation for veiling based on the principle that an object s co band head is undetectable when its maximum absorption depth is less than 3.0 times the rms noise over 1 resolution element ( 5 pixels ) in the spectrum .",
    "this is a robust minimum likely veiling criterion because less veiling would ensure that the band head would be definitely detected , and considering more resolution elements would increase the amount of veiling derived .",
    "the resultant derived minimum likely @xmath23 values matched those of templates which were veiled to the point where their co absorptions just disappeared visually .",
    "possible differences between the actual spectral types of these sources and the m0 template also cause uncertainties in the derived veilings of up to about 50% , but most deviations are expected to be smaller than this . all observed class i sources except elias 29 are relatively low luminosity , 2.4 l@xmath28 l@xmath29 l@xmath30 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter wly ) .",
    "all observed flat - spectrum ysos have 1 l@xmath28 l@xmath31 l@xmath30 ( wly ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "these luminosities are consistent with the sources being low - mass pms ysos ( m @xmath32 1 m@xmath30 ) if the class i objects are powered by accretion , an assumption which is consistent with their high veilings ( see also  4.2 ) . in using vssg 17 as a spectral type template to measure veilings , we have implicitly assumed that all sources have spectral types near m0iv / v , a typical value for t tauri stars .",
    "a young star of this spectral type has a mass of approximately 0.4 m@xmath30 if on the birthline of the h ",
    "r diagram ( see * ? ? ?",
    "if an observed yso is really 1 m@xmath30 , then it would have a spectral type of k34iv / v ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and thus an intrinsic stellar co equivalent width of only about 0.6 times that of an m0iv / v star ( see paper i ) .",
    "this would mean that its actual veiling is @xmath33 ( see  4.2 of paper i ) where @xmath23 is the veiling estimate made assuming an m0iv / v spectral type .",
    "likewise , if an observed object were really a lower mass star near the brown dwarf limit , then its true birthline spectral type would be near m6iv / v and its intrinsic co absorption would be about 40% greater than that of the m0iv / v template .",
    "thus the true veilings of observed sources may differ from our derived ones by as much as 50% .",
    "however , it is unlikely that many of the observed objects have such large deviations ( in either direction ) because their luminosities are consistent with most having masses of approximately 0.5 m@xmath30 , similar to that expected for our m0iv / v template .",
    "we have used other published information on the observed objects when available to estimate their intrinsic spectral types before deriving veiling estimates ( see  4.1 and 4.2 ) .",
    "finally , we studied how rotation decreases the apparent co band head absorption depths .",
    "this effect can be separated from veiling by measuring the slope of the co band head , but this is not possible for sources which do not show this absorption feature .",
    "the majority of sources in our sample do not show this feature , so we do not know their rotation velocities .",
    "our earlier study ( paper ii ) showed that flat - spectrum sources rotate significantly faster than class ii ysos , so our current sample of more highly embedded flat - spectrum and class i ysos may rotate even faster still ( perhaps @xmath5 sin @xmath34 km s@xmath7 ) .",
    "indeed , recent x - ray observations with the asca satellite indicate that one class i source in our sample ( irs 43 ) is rotating at least this rapidly @xcite .",
    "we estimate that the equatorial rotational breakup velocities of these young stars ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) are approximately @xmath37 km s@xmath7 , or @xmath5 sin @xmath38 km s@xmath7 for a mean inclination @xmath39 .",
    "next , we studied how rotation decreases the maximum co band head absorption in ysos by artificially rotating our wl 5 template by convolving its observed spectrum with limb - darkened stellar broadening profiles for 25 km s@xmath40 sin @xmath41 km s@xmath7 .",
    "see paper ii for more details and examples of artificially rotated spectra .",
    "these experiments showed that the maximum co absorption depth of the vssg 25 template with @xmath5 sin @xmath42 km s@xmath7 is a factor of 1.37 weaker than the one with @xmath5 sin @xmath27 km s@xmath7 .",
    "therefore if vssg 17 were rotating at breakup , its maximum co absorption depth would be only 73% as deep as now seen in its spectrum .",
    "thus if rotating near breakup , the featureless objects in our sample would have somewhat lower continuum veilings than those calculated based on the observed vssg 17 spectrum .",
    "we have calculated these reduced values , and in table 2 we present all of these estimated veilings for the observed sources , using our best estimates of their intrinsic spectral types .",
    "we now discuss how the results of this veiling / rotation analysis and pre - existing data constrain the possible physical natures of these sources .",
    "the flat - spectrum ysos irs 63 and irs 51 were both found to have broad , weak co absorptions which matched those expected for late - type stellar photospheres rotating at @xmath5 sin @xmath43 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the weak co absorptions of these two ysos are consistent with their not being detected in our initial low - resolution survey ( paper i ) .",
    "we estimate the continuum veiling of irs 63 to be @xmath44 provided that it is a pms yso near m0 spectral type .",
    "@xcite find that the spectral type of irs 51 is g5  k7 , earlier than our m0 template vssg 17 .",
    "thus their derived veiling @xmath23 = 1  3 is lower than ours because a g5  k7 pms star has less intrinsic co absorption than a m0 one ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "it is likely that irs 51 is indeed an embedded low - mass yso because its bolometric luminosity is only 1.4 l@xmath30 ( wly ) .",
    "the birthline mass for this luminosity is approximately 0.5 m@xmath30 , corresponding to a spectral type of k57 and a true veiling of @xmath45 .",
    "thus it is likely that both irs 63 and irs 51 are similar to the quickly rotating flat - spectrum ysos which we analyzed in paper ii , but these new objects have even greater veiling ( i.e. @xmath23 = 3  4 versus @xmath46 for the paper ii ysos ) .",
    "@xcite found gss 26 to have variable veiling , @xmath23 = 0.75 and @xmath23 = 4 at epochs of 1994 july and 1996 may , respectively .",
    "our spectrum of gss 26 ( in figure 1 ) was taken in 1997 may , one year after the latest @xcite spectrum .",
    "we estimate that @xmath47 when our spectrum was acquired , and our assumption of a m0 spectral type is consistent with the @xcite determination of k5  m2 . this rapid increase in veiling - a factor of 2 each year - is perhaps suggestive of a similarly rapid increase in accretion .",
    "@xcite also note that this source increased in brightness by @xmath48 1.2 mag between epochs .",
    "our spectra are not photometrically calibrated , but comparisons with other objects support that this source was at least as bright as when observed by @xcite the previous year .",
    "this is one of the ysos @xcite observed whose hi br @xmath49 emission line flux increased as its veiling increased , implying that the excess continuum emission is associated with a circumstellar accretion disk if the br @xmath49 emission arises from disk accretion .",
    "the rapid variability of this object s veiling also suggests that its @xmath3-band veiling is produced by accretion from inner disk distances ( several au ) and not from an outer disk or an outer circumstellar envelope .",
    "the high @xmath23 values of these objects also constrain the physical origins of their veilings . in paper i",
    "we showed that veilings @xmath50 can not be produced by a simple optically thick , geometrically thin reprocessing disk around a low - mass pms star .",
    "consequently we argued that these high veilings are most likely produced by either actively accreting circumstellar disks or circumstellar envelopes associated with these objects .",
    "furthermore we found that veilings in the range measured for irs 51 and irs 63 , @xmath23 = 3  4 , can be caused by luminous accretion disks ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "veilings in the range observed for gss 26 , @xmath52 , could be explained by extremely luminous accretion disks ( @xmath53 ) . in either case , these accretion disks would have to have relatively large central holes to avoid producing strong co absorption - line systems in the disk photosphere itself .",
    "however , because there is no obvious physical mechanism for producing central holes of the needed size , @xcite suggested that the veiling flux must originate in some other circumstellar structure such as the inner regions of the protostellar envelope . on the other hand , this seems to be inconsistent with the observation by @xcite that the @xmath3-band excesses of flat - spectrum ysos are correlated with their hi br @xmath49 line fluxes which in turn suggests that the veiling flux should originate in the disk .",
    "more detailed knowledge of the conditions required to produce co absorption line systems in an accretion disk may be needed to resolve this issue .",
    "the flat - spectrum source ylw 13b was found to have h br @xmath49 absorption by @xcite , who estimate its spectral type to be earlier than k0 .",
    "however , they also find it to be significantly veiled with @xmath54 , so it is possibly an intermediate mass pms cloud population member .",
    "our non - detection of co absorption does not constrain this source further .",
    "we do not detect co absorptions in any of the class i ysos which we observed ( figure 2 ) , confirming earlier low resolution spectroscopic observations that found all these objects to be featureless and highly veiled ( paper i ; @xcite ) .",
    "consequently their spectral types are unknown , however all of these class i sources exhibit hi br @xmath49 emission ( paper i ; @xcite ) .",
    "analysis of our new data constrains the natures of these objects .",
    "table 2 shows that they all have large veilings , @xmath55 , if they are late - type ( @xmath56 m0 ) stars .",
    "gss 30 , irs 43 , and wl 6 , all have estimated minimum veilings of @xmath57 , overlapping with the flat - spectrum sample .",
    "these sources all have bolometric luminosities l@xmath29 l@xmath30 ( wly ) .",
    "this is consistent with their being low - mass ( m @xmath32 1 m@xmath30 ) protostars accreting matter at rates @xmath58 m@xmath59 yr@xmath7 , the value expected for the t @xmath60 20 k gas temperatures in the @xmath2 oph cloud ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter als ) .",
    "veilings in the observed range , @xmath61 , are also predicted by theoretical models of class i circumstellar envelopes ( paper i ; calvet et al . ) .",
    "@xcite note that the maximum possible mass of irs 43 ( also known as ylw 15 ) is 2.2 m@xmath30 which is derived from pms models given its bolometric luminosity ( l @xmath56 10 l@xmath30 ) and assuming it is on the birthline .",
    "likewise , they calculate that the maximum likely mass of wl6 is approximately 0.4 m@xmath30 ; this increases somewhat if the l@xmath62 = 2.4 l@xmath30 of wly is adopted .",
    "these maximum calculated masses assume that essentially all luminosity is due to photospheric thermal radiation ( @xmath63 ) and essentially none is due to accretion ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "these sources are discussed further in @xmath65 .",
    "we estimate that elias 29 and irs 54 have very high veilings if they are late - type low - mass stars , @xmath66 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of irs 54 is estimated to be only 12 l@xmath30 ( wly ) , also consistent with this object being a low - mass protostar which is accreting its envelope at the rate prescribed by the @xmath2 oph cloud s gas temperature",
    ". however , its continuum veiling must be @xmath67 if it has spectral type m0 and is rotating rapidly .",
    "this is about a factor of 2 higher than the model predictions of calvet et al .",
    ", but those calculations were done for a hypothetical @xmath2 oph class i yso with l = 5 l@xmath30 .",
    "the model may predict greater veiling for irs 54 if its higher luminosity is taken into consideration .",
    "it is also possible that this source may be a somewhat earlier type protostar which is less veiled .",
    "elias 29 has the highest derived veiling of the sample , @xmath68 , assuming an intrinsic m0 photosphere and a high rotation rate .",
    "wly estimate its luminosity to be l@xmath62 = 48 l@xmath30 , and als have modeled it as a 1 m@xmath30 protostar which is accreting its circumstellar envelope .",
    "such a star would have a spectral type of k34 if on the birthline ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with an intrinsic co absorption approximately 60% as strong as that of an m0 star ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "thus we revise our estimate of the likely veiling of this yso to @xmath69 if it is indeed a 1 m@xmath30 protostar . in paper",
    "i we analyzed the als model for elias 29 and showed that the predicted emission from the inner protostellar envelope of this source would produce a veiling of @xmath70 , assuming that its disk luminosity is 0.75 l@xmath62 .",
    "thus our new measurement is consistent with our earlier prediction based on the als model .",
    "the high luminosity of elias 29 also allows for it being a more massive , earlier spectral type yso that has higher stellar luminosity and less accretion luminosity than assumed by the als model .",
    "however , it is unlikely to be very different because the observed near - to - far ir energy distribution and the 10 @xmath71 silicate absorption of elias 29 are fit well by the als model , and there are no clues which indicate that elias 29 is an early - type object .",
    "for example , wl 16 , which is likely an early a type star @xcite , has mid - ir aromatic hydrocarbon emission features which indicate a uv radiation field @xcite . however , elias 29 shows no evidence for ir hydrocarbon emission @xcite and thus no evidence for a uv radiation field .      our observations , specifically the broad band head shapes of irs 51 and irs 63 ,",
    "strengthen the earlier findings of paper ii which suggested that flat - spectrum protostars rotate more rapidly than class ii sources ( cttss ) .",
    "since flat - spectrum protostars are believed to be evolutionary precursors of cttss , then this finding may indicate that certain physical conditions characteristic of protostellar evolution ( e.g. , high accretion rates ) may result in their higher rotation rates .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask whether the less evolved class i sources might rotate even more rapidly than the flat spectrum sources .",
    "indeed , some models of protostar development predict that such objects should be rotating near breakup @xcite .    recently",
    ", strong hard x - ray flares have been observed with the asca satellite from two of the class i protostars in our sample  irs 43 and wl 6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these remarkable observations reveal relatively rapid periodicities in the x - ray emission from these sources , enabling the derivation of their photometric rotation rates .",
    "@xcite find that wl 6 is rotating with a period of about 3 days ( @xmath5 sin @xmath72 km s@xmath7 for a 0.5 m@xmath59 star on the birthline ) , comparable to the rotation rates of the flat - spectrum sources observed here and in paper ii .",
    "this source also has a weak outflow @xcite , undetected millimeter emission from its envelope @xcite , and an ir energy distribution which can be modeled as a highly extinguished flat spectrum yso ( @xcite ) .",
    "all of these properties indicate that wl 6 may indeed be very similar to the flat spectrum ysos for which we have detected absorption lines and have found to be rotating more rapidly than cttss ( class ii ysos ) .",
    "@xcite also argue that the central star of irs 43 has a 20 h rotation period , the observed period of its x - ray variability .",
    "this requires that its mass be greater than or equal to 1.8 m@xmath30 in order for it to be rotating below breakup velocity if it is on the birthline ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus the mass of irs 43 is constrained to lie in the range 1.8  2.2 m@xmath30 by its x - ray emission and bolometric luminosity ( see @xmath73 ) if its rotation period is indeed equal to its x - ray variability period of 20 h. irs 43 does have a more steep mid - ir energy distribution ( clearly class i ) than wl 6 , and it also has spatially - resolved ( r @xmath60 3000 au ) millimeter emission with a derived envelope mass of approximately 0.1 m@xmath30 ( @xcite ) . therefore it is likely to be in an earlier evolutionary state than wl 6 .",
    "the slow rotation velocities of cttss have been explained by angular momentum regulation of these stars by magnetic coupling to their disks .",
    "@xcite found that late - type t tauri stars ( ttss ) with large @xmath74 ir excesses ( cttss ) had slow rotation periods , p @xmath75 4 d. they also found that tts with small @xmath74 ir excesses had a broad range of periods , including a significant number with p @xmath32 4 days .",
    "@xcite interpreted this correlation to arise because the magnetic fields of the cttss were were coupled to their disks , providing stellar angular momentum regulation and therefore long stellar rotation periods .",
    "the low - excess ttss had already dissipated their disks and so were not subject to this regulation mechanism .",
    "more recent studies of larger tts samples have both disputed that the correlation between ir excess and rotation period exists @xcite and have provided evidence that it exists but is weak @xcite .",
    "our studies of yso rotation ( this paper and paper ii ) have shown that flat - spectrum protostars rotate significantly more rapidly than class ii ysos or cttss , suggesting that rotation velocities decrease as stars evolve past the protostellar state .",
    "this scenario has been bolstered and expanded further by the recent x - ray results of @xcite .",
    "taken together ( and along with the many rotation studies of optically visible cttss ) , these works suggest that heavily embedded protostars ( class i ) rotate very rapidly , in some cases near breakup velocity , while less embedded ones ( flat  spectrum ysos ) rotate somewhat less rapidly , at about 1/3 breakup velocity ( @xmath5 sin @xmath43 km s@xmath7 ) , and class ii ysos / cttss rotate slowly , @xmath5 sin @xmath76 km s@xmath7 .",
    "this finding would be strengthened considerably by further cross - checking of observational techniques ; the x - ray protostars should be observed at higher signal - to - noise in the near - ir to search for rotationally broadened lines , while the flat spectrum and class ii ysos with ir - derived rotation velocities should be observed for periodic x - ray variability .    if the angular momenta of low - mass ysos are indeed regulated by star  disk coupling , then the fact that flat - spectrum ( and at least one class i ) ysos rotate significantly more rapidly than ctts implies that either the flat - spectrum / protostellar ysos are coupled to faster rotating disk regions than cttss , or else that stars and disks do not become rotationally locked until the ctts evolutionary phase . in the first case ,",
    "flat - spectrum and class i ysos may couple to their disks at smaller radii ( and hence have higher rotation velocities ) because their accretion rates are much higher than ctts .",
    "the veilings and luminosities of class i and flat - spectrum ysos are considerably higher ( by about an order of magnitude ) than ctts , supporting the notion that they have higher accretion rates also . in support of the second case ,",
    "@xcite have posited that protostars are not initially magnetically coupled to their disks but rather spin - down and become coupled over a magnetic braking time on the order of 10@xmath77 yr which is nearly linearly proportional to stellar mass .",
    "this is comparable to the lifetime of the class i and flat spectrum phases , so this would account for the higher rotation velocities of flat - spectrum and class i protostars .",
    "this latter magnetic braking scenario of velocity evolution from class i to flat - spectrum to ctts ysos may be somewhat complicated by mass effects ; @xcite predict that at the same age more massive protostars will rotate more quickly than less massive ones .",
    "protostellar masses must be measured much more accurately before this effect can be verified , however .",
    "obtaining new high resolution , high signal - to - noise spectra over the entire 1.5  2.4 @xmath71 region will likely be the best method for obtaining more definitive information on the masses ( spectral types ) and rotational characteristics of class i protostars .",
    "this wide spectral range is required in order to be sensitive to a wide range of spectral types .",
    "even intermediate - to - high mass stars with hi line emission may show @xmath78-band hi br absorption lines which may strongly constrain spectral types and masses ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while @xmath3-band data are required to determine the properties of very red late - type ysos .",
    "detecting and resolving near - ir lines in wl 6 and irs 43 would allow determination of their masses and photospheric rotation rates , providing a good test of the emerging scenario of protostellar rotational evolution .",

    "<S> two of the flat - spectrum protostellar objects also show no absorption features and are likely to be highly veiled . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining two flat - spectrum sources show weak , broad absorptions which are consistent with an origin in quickly rotating ( @xmath5 sin @xmath6 km s@xmath7 ) late - type stellar photospheres which are also strongly veiled , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> these observations provide further evidence that : 1)-class i sources are highly veiled at near - infrared wavelengths , confirming previous findings of lower resolution spectroscopic studies ; and 2)- flat - spectrum protostars rotate more rapidly than classical t tauri stars ( class ii sources ) , supporting findings from a recent high resolution spectroscopic study of other flat - spectrum sources in this cloud . </S>",
    "<S> in addition our observations are consistent with the high rotation rates derived for two of the class i protostellar objects in our sample from observations of variable hard x - ray emission obtained with the asca satellite . </S>",
    "<S> these observations suggest that certain class i sources can rotate even more rapidly than flat - spectrum protostars , near breakup velocity . </S>"
