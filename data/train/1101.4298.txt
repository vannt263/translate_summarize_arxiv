    "the numerical investigation of the inspiral and merger of binary neutron stars ( nss ) in full general relativity has made big strides in recent years .",
    "crucial improvements in the formulation of the equations and numerical methods , along with increased computational resources , have extended the scope of early simulations .",
    "these developments have made it possible to compute the full evolution , from large binary - separations up to black - hole ( bh ) formation , without and with magnetic fields  @xcite , and with idealized or realistic equations - of - state ( eos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this tremendous progress is also providing information about the entire gravitational waveform , from the early inspiral up to the ringing of the bh ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "advanced interferometric detectors starting from 2014 are expected to observe these sources at a rate of @xmath4 events per year  @xcite .",
    "these simulations also probe whether the end - product of mergers can serve as the `` central engine '' of sgrbs  @xcite .",
    "the prevalent scenario invoked to explain sgrbs involves the coalescence of a binary system of compact objects , _",
    "e.g. _  a bh and a ns or two nss  @xcite . after the coalescence",
    ", the merged object is expected to collapse to a bh surrounded by an accretion torus .",
    "an essential ingredient in this scenario is the formation of a central engine , which is required to launch a relativistic outflow with an energy of @xmath5  erg on a timescale of @xmath6  s  @xcite . with only one possible exception  @xcite",
    ", sgrb afterglows do not clearly show a jet - associated light - curve steepening  @xcite , thus suggesting typical jet opening half - angles of at least several degrees .",
    "the qualitative scenario described above is generally supported by the association of sgrbs with old stellar populations , distinct from the young massive star associations for long grbs  @xcite .",
    "it is also supported to a good extent by fully general - relativistic simulations , which show that the formation of a torus of mass @xmath7 around a bh with spin @xmath8 , is inevitable  @xcite .",
    "however , the simulations have so far failed to show that a jet _ can _ be produced .",
    "we here provide the first evidence that the merger of a binary of modestly magnetized nss naturally forms many of the conditions needed to produce a jet of ultrastrong magnetic field , with properties that are broadly consistent with sgrb observations .",
    "0.2 cm   0.2 cm   0.2 cm     for the simulations we use the cactus / carpet / whisky codes @xcite and we consider a configuration that could represent the properties of a ns - binary a few orbits before its coalescence , within a fully general - relativistic and an ideal - magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) framework  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we simulate two equal - mass nss , each with a gravitational mass of @xmath9 ( _ i.e. _  sufficiently large to produce a bh soon after the merger ) , an equatorial radius of @xmath10 , and on a circular orbit with initial separation of @xmath11 between the centres ( all lengthscales are coordinate scales ;  @xcite ) . confined in each star is a poloidal magnetic field with a maximum strength of @xmath12  ( indicated as ` m1.62-b12 ` in * ? ? ?",
    "at this separation , the binary loses energy and angular momentum via emission of gravitational waves ( gws ) , thus rapidly proceeding on tighter orbits as it evolves .",
    "after about @xmath13 ( @xmath14 orbits ) the two nss merge forming a hypermassive ns ( hmns ) , namely , a rapidly and differentially - rotating ns , whose mass , @xmath15 , is above the maximum mass , @xmath16 , allowed with uniform rotation by our ideal - gas eos with an adiabatic index of 2 .",
    "being metastable , a hmns can exist as long as it is able to resist against collapse via a suitable redistribution of angular momentum ( _ e.g. _  deforming into a  bar  shape , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or through the pressure support coming from the large temperature - increase produced by the merger .",
    "however , because the hmns is also losing angular momentum through gws , its lifetime is limited to a few ms , after which it collapses to a bh with mass @xmath17 and spin @xmath18 , surrounded by a hot and dense torus with mass @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "these stages of the evolution can be seen in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , which shows snapshots of the density color - coded between @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and of the magnetic field lines ( green on the equatorial plane and white outside the torus ) .",
    "soon after the bh formation the torus reaches a quasi - stationary regime , during which the density has maximum values of @xmath22 , while the accretion rate settles to @xmath23 .",
    "using the measured values of the torus mass and of the accretion rate , and assuming the latter will not change significantly , such a regime could last for @xmath24  s , after which the torus is fully accreted ; furthermore , if the two nss have unequal masses , tidal tails are produced which provide additional late - time accretion  @xcite .",
    "this accretion timescale is close to the typical observed sgrb durations  @xcite .",
    "it is also long enough for the neutrinos produced in the torus to escape and annihilate in its neighborhood ; estimates of the associated energy deposition rate range from @xmath25  @xcite to @xmath26  @xcite , thus leading to a total energy deposition between a few @xmath27 and a few @xmath28 over a fraction of a second",
    ". this energy would be sufficient to launch a relativistic fireball , but because we do not yet account for radiative losses , the large reservoir of thermal energy in the torus can not be extracted in our simulations .     1.0 cm     the gw signal of the whole process is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : fig2 ] , while the bottom part exhibits the evolution of the mhd luminosity , @xmath29 , as computed from the integrated poynting flux ( solid line ) and of the corresponding energy , @xmath30 ( dashed line ) .",
    "clearly , the mhd emission starts only at the time of merger and increases exponentially after bh formation , when the gw signal essentially shuts off . assuming that the quasi - stationary mhd luminosity is @xmath31 , the total mhd energy released during the lifetime of the torus is @xmath32 , which",
    ", if spread over an opening half - angle of @xmath3 ( see discussion below ) , suggests a lower limit to the isotropic equivalent energy in the outflow of @xmath33 .",
    "while this is at the low end of the observed distribution of gamma - ray energies for sgrbs , larger mhd luminosities are expected either through the additional growth of the magnetic field via the ongoing winding of the field lines in the disk ( the simulation covers only one tenth of @xmath34 ) , or when magnetic reconnection ( which can not take place within our ideal - mhd approach ) , is also accounted for ( which may also increase the gamma - ray efficiency ; see , _",
    "e.g. _   * ? ? ?",
    "the last two panels of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] offer views of the accreting torus after the bh formation .",
    "although the _ matter _ dynamics is quasi - stationary , the last two panels clearly show that the _ magnetic field _ is not and instead evolves significantly .",
    "it is only when the system is followed well after the formation of a bh , that mhd instabilities develop and generate the central , low - density , poloidal - field funnel .",
    "this regime , which was not accessible to previous simulations  @xcite , is essential for the jet formation  @xcite .",
    "because the strongly magnetized matter in the torus is highly conductive , it shears the magnetic - field lines via differential rotation .",
    "a measurement of the angular velocity in the torus indicates that it is essentially keplerian and thus unstable to the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which develops @xmath35 after bh formation and amplifies exponentially both the poloidal and the toroidal magnetic fields ; the _ e_-folding time of the instability is @xmath36 and in good agreement with the one expected in the outer parts of the torus  @xcite . because of this exponential growth , the final value of the magnetic field is largely insensitive to the initial strength and thus a robust feature of the dynamics .    a quantitative view of the magnetic - field growth is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : fig2 ] , which shows the evolution of the maximum values in the poloidal and toroidal components . note that the latter is negligibly small before the merger , reaches equipartition with the poloidal field as a result of a kelvin - helmholtz instability triggered by the shearing of the stellar surfaces at merger  @xcite , and finally grows to @xmath37 g by the end of the simulation . at later times ( @xmath38 ) , when the instability is suppressed , the further growth of the field is due to the shearing of the field lines and it increases only as a power law with exponent @xmath39 for the poloidal  ( toroidal ) component .",
    "although the magnetic - field growth essentially stalls after @xmath40 , further slower growths are possible  @xcite , yielding correspondingly larger poynting fluxes . indeed ,",
    "when the ratio between the magnetic flux across the horizon and the mass accretion rate becomes sufficiently large , a blandford - znajek mechanism  @xcite may be ignited  @xcite ; such conditions are not met over the timescale of our simulations , but could develop over longer timescales . also shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : fig2 ] is the maximum local fluid energy , highlighting that an _ unbound outflow _ ( _ i.e. _  @xmath41 ) develops after bh formation along the outer walls of the torus and persists for the whole duration of the simulation .",
    "0.2 cm   0.2 cm   0.2 cm     finally , figure  [ fig : fig4 ] provides a summary of the magnetic - field dynamics .",
    "it shows the magnetic field in the hmns formed after the merger and its structure and dynamics after the collapse to bh . in particular ,",
    "in the last three panels it shows the magnetic - field structure inside the torus and on the equatorial plane ( green ) , and outside the torus and near the axis ( white ) .",
    "it is apparent that the highly turbulent magnetic field in the hmns ( @xmath42 ) changes systematically as the bh is produced ( @xmath43 ) , leading to the formation of a toroidal magnetic field in the torus ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "as the mri sets in , the magnetic field is not only amplified , but also organizes itself into a dual structure , which is mostly toroidal in the accretion torus with @xmath45 , but predominantly poloidal and jet - like along the bh spin axis , with @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "note that the generation of an ordered large - scale field is far from trivial and a nonlinear dynamo may explain why the mri brings a magnetic field self - organization , as it has been also suggested in case of mri - mediated growth of the magnetic field in the conditions met in the collapse of massive stellar cores  @xcite .",
    "however , the jet - like structure produced in the simulation is not yet the highly collimated ultrarelativistic outflow expected in sgrbs ( see also below ) .",
    "the hollow jet - like magnetic structure has an opening half - angle of @xmath3 , which sets an upper limit for the opening half - angle of any potential outflow , either produced by neutrino energy deposition  @xcite or by electromagnetic ( em ) processes  @xcite . in our simulations",
    "most of the outflow develops along the edges of the jet - like structure , via a turbulent layer of em driven matter , which shields the central funnel from excessive baryonic pollution .",
    "we envision that such a layer is crucial to set the opening angle of any ultrarelativistic jet , to shape both the radial and transverse structure of the jet , as well as to determine its stability properties .",
    "the lorentz factors of the outflow measured in our simulations are not very high ( @xmath48 ) , but can potentially be amplified by several orders of magnitude in the inner baryon - poor regions through special - relativistic effects  @xcite or the variability of the flow  @xcite .",
    "we expect that such accelerations will be produced as a more realistic and general - relativistic treatment of the radiative losses will become computationally affordable .",
    "below we briefly discuss how our results broadly match the properties of the central engine as deduced from the observations .",
    "the observed duration of the prompt gamma - ray emission grbs is energy dependent and is usually determined through @xmath49 , the time over which @xmath50 of the total counts are observed , between the @xmath51 and @xmath52 percentiles .",
    "the most common intervals used are @xmath53 ( or @xmath54 ) , initially defined  @xcite between @xmath55kev and @xmath56mev .",
    "the grb duration distribution is bimodal  @xcite , where the durations of sgrbs ( approximately 25% of grbs ) are well - fit by a fairly wide log - normal distribution centered around @xmath57s with a fwhm of 1.4 dex  @xcite .",
    "the typical redshifts of the sgrbs observed with _",
    "swift _ are in the range @xmath58 , suggesting a central value of the intrinsic duration distribution of @xmath59s , and a comparably wide distribution around this value .",
    "this is in close agreement with our accretion time of @xmath60s .",
    "the isotropic equivalent energy output in the prompt gamma - ray emission of sgrbs , @xmath61 , spans a wide range , from @xmath62erg ( in the observed energy range @xmath63kev ) for grb  050509b at a redshift of @xmath64  @xcite , up to @xmath65erg ( in the observed energy range 10@xmath66kev ",
    "30@xmath66gev ) for grb  090510 at @xmath67  @xcite . however , the most typical values are in the range @xmath68erg  @xcite . in our model , the highly relativistic outflow may be powered either by neutrino - anti neutrino annihilation , or by the blandford - znajek mechanism . for",
    "the former one might expect a total energy release between a few @xmath69erg and @xmath70erg  @xcite , into a bipolar relativistic jet of opening half - angle @xmath71 , corresponding to a fraction @xmath72 of the total solid angle , and isotropic equivalent energies , @xmath73 , between a few @xmath74erg and @xmath75erg .",
    "for the latter mechanism , instead , and if the magnetization near the event horizon becomes sufficiently high , we could expect a jet power for our values for the bh mass and spin that is of  @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the fraction of the total blandford - znajek power that is channeled into the resulting relativistic jet ( and @xmath78 might be expected for ejecta with asymptotic lorentz factors above @xmath79 ) .",
    "this relativistic outflow is launched over a timescale of @xmath80 and corresponds to @xmath81    comparing the x - ray afterglow luminosity ( after 10 or 11 hours ) and @xmath61 suggests that the efficiency of the prompt gamma - ray emission in sgrbs is typically high  @xcite , and similar to that of long grbs  @xcite , with @xmath82 , radiating between @xmath83 and @xmath84 of the initial energy of the ultrarelativistic outflow .",
    "therefore , our model is able to accommodate the observed @xmath61 values .",
    "the fermi gamma - ray space telescope has detected gev emission from sgrbs  @xcite , suggesting typical lower limits of @xmath85 .",
    "in particular , @xmath86 was obtained for grb  090510  @xcite . however , a more realistic model  @xcite results in @xmath87 values lower by a factor of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the central engine should be capable of producing outflow lorentz factors of at least a few hundred .",
    "the fact that our simulation produces a strongly magnetized mildly relativistic outflow at angles near @xmath3 from the bh spin axis would help shield the inner region near the spin axis from excessive baryon loading , and thus assist in achieving high asymptotic lorentz factors at large distance from the source , after the outflow in this region is triggered by neutrinos and/or the blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "this is poorly constrained by observations ( even more so than for long grbs ) .",
    "the only compelling case for a jet break in the afterglow light curve is for grb  090510  @xcite , which occurred very early on ( after @xmath88s ) , and would thus imply an extremely narrow jet ( @xmath89 ) and modest true energy output in gamma rays ( @xmath90erg ) .",
    "if this is indeed a jet break , it might correspond to a line of sight near a very narrow and bright core of a jet , which also has significantly wider wings .",
    "observers with lines of sight along these wings would then see a much dimmer and more typical sgrb  @xcite ; without such wings , however , the observations would suggest a very large intrinsic and beaming - corrected event rate per unit volume . in most cases",
    "there are only lower limits on a possible jet break time  @xcite , resulting in typical limits of @xmath91 or @xmath92 .",
    "this is consistent with our expectation of @xmath93 for the ultrarelativistic ejecta capable of producing a sgrb ( which would also imply a reasonable sgrb intrinsic event rate per unit volume ) .",
    "the calculations reported here clearly demonstrate that a binary merger of two nss inevitably leads to the formation of a relativistic jet - like and ultrastrong magnetic field , which could serve as a central engine for sgrbs . because the magnetic - field growth is exponential , the picture emerging from our simulations is rather general and applies equally even to mildly magnetized nss .",
    "overall , this work removes a significant earlier uncertainty as to whether such binary mergers can indeed produce the central engines of sgrbs .",
    "while the em energy release is already broadly compatible with the observations , our simulations lack a proper treatment of the energy losses via photons and neutrinos , which can provide a fundamental contribution to the energy input necessary to launch the fireball and cool the torus  @xcite .",
    "this additional energy input , whose self - consistent inclusion in general relativity remains extremely challenging , may help to launch an ultrarelativistic outflow very early after the bh forms and complete the picture of the central engine of a sgrb .",
