    "correct mathematical description of a specific quantum system was in many cases obtained _ via _ an appropriate `` quantization procedure '' from the corresponding `` classical theory '' .",
    "the first example of this type is the heisenberg approach to quantum mechanics .",
    "most of the field - theoretical models , like quantum electrodynamics , have also been constructed this way .",
    "geometric quantization ( see e.  g.  @xcite ) was an attempt to formalize the above analogy between classical and quantum systems and to provide a tool to construct uniquely quantum theory once its classical counterpart is known .",
    "in particular , it has been noticed that some mathematical structures used in mechanics and classical field theory on one side and in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory on the other are very similar .",
    "it was obvious from the very beginning that this analogy can not go too far because quantum physics _ can not be reduced _ to classical physics .",
    "nevertheless , such a unifying point of view has lead to important mathematical results in theory of group representations , theory of analytic functions , differential geometry and other branches of mathematics ( see e.  g.  @xcite ) .",
    "seen from the physical context , quantum mechanics ( both the schrdinger and the heisenberg version ) has , _ a priori _ very little to do with the symplectic structure of the underlying classical phase space . indeed , it _ is not _ invariant with respect to ( non - linear ) canonical transformations !    _ a priori _ it is even non - invariant with respect to non - linear point transformations !",
    "however , this invariance may be easily restored if we use metric structure @xmath0 of the configuration space @xmath1 , define the hilbert space of pure states as @xmath2 and take the laplace - beltrami operator ( with minus sign ) as the kinetic energy .",
    "this is a relatively nice framework ( called `` covariant quantum mechanics '' ) , which was recently thoroughly analyzed e.g. by m.  modugno ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular , no assumptions concerning the topology of the configuration space @xmath1 are necessary here . however , there are severe restrictions for the applicability of this approach : the time must be absolute , only non - relativistic hamiltonians ( i.e. `` kinetic plus potential energy '' ) are allowed , no momentum representation is available etc .    a deep analysis of quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory , first performed by j.  m.  souriau ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and , independently , by w.  tulczyjew ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , lead to the formulation of `` geometric quantization theory '' , based on the phase space and its symplectic structure .    a popular approach to `` geometric quantization ''",
    "consists in defining the quantum dynamics in terms of the `` reproducing kernels '' ( see @xcite and the monographs @xcite or @xcite ) , which are carried by the geometric structure of the phase space of the system with finite number of degrees of freedom ( the corresponding structures arising in field theory was analyzed in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the complete symplectic structure can not be represented on the quantum level , even if more and more sophisticated mathematical tools are introduced . in particular , the classical observable algebra ( equipped with the poisson bracket ) has no appropriate _",
    "irreducible _ representation in the algebra of operators acting in the hilbert space . here ,",
    "`` appropriate '' means that it reduces to the standard quantum mechanics when restricted to the ( finite or infinite - dimensional ) heisenberg algebra .",
    "different functional - analytic frameworks can be chosen in order to convert the above `` meta - mathematical '' statement into a precise theorem , but non of them ( e.g. : bounded or unbounded , continuous , smooth or only measurable observables ) leads to a satisfactory representation .",
    "the notion of a _ prequantization _ , introduced by j.  m.  souriau , even if mathematically beautiful , does not help much , because it leads to the representation which is highly _",
    "reducible _ and , therefore , can not be used when calculating e.g. atomic optical spectra .",
    "physicists , chemists and quantum opticians , who try to model physical properties of complicated multi - molecular systems _ via _ schrdinger equation , often use specific `` quantization rules '' , formulated in terms of specific `` orderings '' imposed on products of operators ( e.g. : normal , anti - normal , weyl etc .",
    ", cf . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they observe that the calculated spectra depend upon the ordering chosen .",
    "this fact may be considered as the `` practical proof '' that the entire classical observable algebra has no quantum representation .",
    "there are deep mathematical results due to geometric quantization theory ( e.g. : representation theory , `` reproducing kernels '' , metaplectic structure , the maslov index etc . ) .",
    "these results are based on highly sophisticated mathematical tools . in spite of that , they are not very useful for applications . as a consequence ,",
    "they remain virtually unknown to physicists . on the other hand",
    ", quantum physicists often discover some elements of this symplectic _ atlantis _ but , in most cases , they are not fully aware of the consequences of these discoveries .",
    "this was recently the case of the `` fractional fourier transform '' , an old mathematical structure rediscovered in quantum optics .",
    "the goal of our paper is to present the basic structures which are necessary to formulate quantum mechanics in a simplest language and to analyze the symplectic invariance of the theory . to make our presentation as simple as possible we limit ourselves to the topologically trivial case ( i.e.  when the physical phase space is topologically equal to @xmath3 )",
    "this is the case of most physical applications .",
    "moreover , we use only those representations of the quantum hilbert space which correspond to the so called `` real polarizations '' .",
    "this excludes some interesting issues like e.g. bargmann representation , but allows us to simplify considerably the mathematical framework which does not go beyond the geometric interpretation of what the physicists know from the very beginning of quantum mechanics and may be found in standard textbooks .",
    "even if mathematically not sophisticated , our approach describes all the essential features of quantum mechanics .",
    "in particular , we prove that in particular case of linear dynamics , geometric quantization can not fail : the _ entire information _ about quantum dynamics can be retrieved from its classical counterpart .",
    "we show that the correct evolution kernels can be obtained from the classical dynamics _ via _ a universal formula which is nothing but a  properly geometrized fourier transformation , superposed with ( again : properly geometrized ) galilei transformation . in particular case of a harmonic oscillator , the `` fractional fourier transform ''",
    "can be obtained as a  specific example . this way we prove that dynamics of various quantum systems , which look apparently very different ( like e.  g. : free motion , harmonic oscillator , motion in a constant electric or magnetic field ) provide specific examples of a single , universal formula . moreover , the classical isomorphism relating any two cases of classical linear dynamics survives quantization represents a  _ local _ ( with respect to space and time ) isomorphism between the corresponding hilbert spaces .",
    "in particular , unexpected symmetries of the schrdinger equation are obtained ( some of them were known already long time ago , see e.  g.  @xcite and references herein ) .",
    "because both the fourier transformation and the galilei transformation describe statics ( change of the representation and change of the reference frame ) we conclude that the dynamics of linear systems is entirely implied by their static properties .",
    "in the last part of the paper we show how a generic , non - linear classical evolution can be lifted to the quantum evolution _ via _ a natural connection in the bundle of quantum states .",
    "the connection is , however , non - flat and this is why the entire canonical structure of the phase space can not be represented on the quantum level .",
    "the fractional fourier transform ( frft ) is known e.g.  from namias paper @xcite .",
    "it gives an important tool in classical optics @xcite , quantum optics @xcite and signal processing @xcite .",
    "but the idea of such an integral transformation appeared much earlier in mathematical literature , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the 1-dimensional frft is given by the following formula ( the coefficients have been chosen in a way which is suitable for purposes of quantum mechanics ) : @xmath4 where the kernel @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is a complex - valued function ( in applications @xmath7 can describe a quantum - mechanical wave - function , or a fully coherent , quasimonochromatic , classical electromagnetic wave ) .",
    "the constant @xmath8 is a real number @xcite .",
    "the formula is , _ a priori _",
    "meaningless for @xmath9 but its limit for @xmath10 does exist and is equal to the dirac distribution @xmath11 .",
    "hence , the corresponding limit of the transformation is equal to identity : @xmath12 .",
    "the transformation is called `` fractional '' , because it provides an interpolation between the identity operator @xmath13 and the ordinary fourier transform which we obtain for @xmath14 . indeed ,",
    "operators @xmath15 depend continuously upon the parameter @xmath8 and satisfy the group property ( see @xcite ) : @xmath16    observe that the formula for the quantum - mechanical propagator of the harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath17 and mass @xmath18 : @xmath19 reduces ( up to a constant phase factor ) to if we choose @xmath20 and re - scale appropriately coordinates @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "this observation is already known from the namias work @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we show that this transformation is a specific example of a generalized fourier transformation which will be defined in a purely geometric , coordinate - invariant way .",
    "before we present this construction in subsequent sections , we are going to show that formula can be simply understood as a superposition of the following two standard operations : 1 ) the conventional fourier transformation between the position and the momentum representations and 2 ) the galilei transformation changing the phase of the wave function as a consequence of the change of a reference frame .    to prove the above statement",
    "let us consider the classical dynamics of the harmonic oscillator and @xmath23 have to be understood as two different coordinate systems in the same phase space .",
    "souriau calls this phase space `` espace des mouvements '' . ] : @xmath24 denote @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "consider first the particular case @xmath29 .",
    "we have : @xmath30 hence , @xmath31 is the momentum canonically conjugate to @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , transition between the @xmath32-representation and @xmath33-representation of the quantum state must be given in terms of the transition between the position and the momentum representation .",
    "indeed , formula reduces to @xmath34 which , essentially , is the fourier kernel defining the transition to the momentum representation . however , we have an extra coefficient `` @xmath35 '' on the right hand side .",
    "its constant phase factor `` @xmath36 '' is due to the convention used and has no physical meaning .",
    "but its modulus is necessary because the wave function is not a scalar object but a _ half - density_. without going too far into mathematical subtleties , which will became obvious in the next section , the above statement means that the square of the modulus of a wave function is a density .",
    "hence , the coefficient `` @xmath37 '' is necessary because its square `` @xmath38 '' represents the change of the volume due to the reparametrization @xmath39 of the momentum space .",
    "now , consider an arbitrary value of the time variable @xmath40 . the same formula ( namely : @xmath41 ) can be rewritten as : @xmath42 we conclude that the quantity @xmath43 may be taken as a momentum canonically conjugate to @xmath21 .",
    "the argument used above explains the multiplicative factor @xmath44 in formula and the last term in the exponent .",
    "but , there is an additional phase factor , namely @xmath45 .",
    "we are going to show that it is a consequence of the galilei transformation corresponding to formula .    indeed , formula is a particular example of a canonical transformation between the old canonical variables @xmath46 , where the new momentum is given by : @xmath47 such a `` momentum translation '' arises e.g.  when performing a galilei transformation : @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the velocity of the new reference frame .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath50 and , therefore , @xmath51 whereas @xmath52 at @xmath53 .",
    "transformation is called a _ generalized galilei transformation _ ,",
    "the name _ proper galilei transformation _ being reserved for the case when the function @xmath54 is constant .    in a generic , multidimensional case , transformation @xmath55 , with @xmath56 is canonical if and only if the differential 1-form @xmath57 is closed . due to topological triviality of the configuration space",
    "this is equivalent to the fact that @xmath58 must be exact , i.e.  we have : @xmath59    the quantum version of the generalized galilei transformation is obvious .",
    "it consists in multiplying the wave function by the phase factor @xmath60 : @xmath61 which , together with the schrdinger representation of the momenta @xmath62 reproduces , indeed , formula .",
    "we stress that the phase @xmath63 is implied by up to an additive constant only .",
    "this agrees with the fact that the global phase of the wave function has no physical significance .",
    "in particular case of the transformation , we have @xmath64 and , therefore : @xmath65 which explains the phase factor @xmath66 in formula .    to explain the remaining phase factor , namely : @xmath67 , let us first summarize the sequence of operations which have to be applied to the wave function @xmath68 in order to reproduce the transformation defined by the integral kernel .    1 .",
    "wave function @xmath68 represents the quantum state with respect to the heisenberg algebra generated by observables @xmath69 .",
    "its representation @xmath70 with respect to @xmath71 , where @xmath72 , is obtained _ via _ the generalized galilei transformation : @xmath73 2 .",
    "we pass to the momentum representation using the ordinary fourier transformation @xmath74 of the function @xmath70 .",
    "this way we exchange the role of @xmath21 and @xmath43 , which corresponds to the canonical transformation @xmath75 .",
    "the momentum canonically conjugate to @xmath43 , namely @xmath76 , is represented now by the operator @xmath77 acting on the wave function  @xmath74 .",
    "next step consists in using ansatz , i.e. : @xmath78 .",
    "this means that we implement the canonical transformation : @xmath79 for this purpose only the density factor @xmath80 is necessary and we obtain the new wave function : @xmath81 4 .",
    "finally , we want to replace the `` fictitious '' momentum @xmath82 by the `` true '' momentum @xmath83 , canonically conjugate to @xmath22 . for this purpose",
    "we use again formulae and : @xmath84 we see that , again , a galilei transformation is necessary , with the phase factor @xmath85 defined by equation @xmath86 and , whence , given by formula . this way we obtain the final wave function",
    "@xmath87 we conclude that the entire missing phase factor in formula comes from the above galilei transformation .",
    "the above procedure shows that the `` fractional fourier transform '' kernel is nothing but the _ ordinary _ fourier kernel ( step 2 . ) , appropriately superposed with two galilei transformations ( steps 1 . and 4 . ) and one obvious transformation coming from rescaling of the corresponding configuration space ( step 3 . ) .",
    "these are standard , _ local _ transformations of the wave function , implied by the necessary rearrangements of the phase - space coordinates . in the present paper",
    "we are going to show that the above construction does not depend upon specific choice of coordinates used in the above example but has a deep geometric meaning .",
    "this way not only harmonic oscillator , but any linear quantum system evolves according to a similar law .",
    "in fact , formula is a special case of kernels which arise in a natural way in geometric quantization @xcite , whenever we want to describe transformation between two representations of a quantum state .",
    "all these kernels may be defined in a geometric , coordinate - independent way .",
    "they arise as superpositions of two standard building blocks : 1 ) the ( appropriately geometrized ) fourier transformation and 2 ) the generalized galilei transformation .",
    "to prove this fact , we analyze in the next section the geometric structure of a  quantum - mechanical wave function in terms of the phase - space geometry .",
    "consider the classical phase space @xmath88 of a system with @xmath89-degrees of freedom .",
    "this means that @xmath90 . by @xmath17",
    "we denote the canonical symplectic form .",
    "locally , a coordinate system @xmath91 , @xmath92 , may be found , such that @xmath17 reduces to the following expression : @xmath93 where the summation convention is always used .",
    "such coordinates are called `` canonical coordinates '' . in this paper",
    "we consider the simplest , topologically trivial case @xmath94 , when canonical coordinates exist globally .    as a consequence of the heisenberg uncertainty relation , quantum - mechanical wave function can not depend upon all these phase - space coordinates but only upon a half of them .",
    "physically , this means that a representation of quantum states in terms of wave functions is possible only _ with respect _ to a `` complete system of commuting observables '' .",
    "examples , such as the `` position representation '' ( wave functions depend upon position variables @xmath95 ) or the `` momentum representation '' ( wave functions depend upon momenta @xmath96 ) are well known .",
    "geometrically , a `` system of commuting observables '' may be considered as a foliation @xmath97 of @xmath98 by the congruence of all @xmath89-dimensional surfaces @xmath99 for the position representation and surfaces @xmath100 for the momentum representation , respectively .",
    "the leaves of the above foliations are _ lagrangian _ submanifolds of @xmath98 .",
    "this means that : 1 ) they are isotropic with respect to the canonical 2-form and 2 ) they have maximal dimension which is possible for isotropic surfaces , namely a half of the dimension of @xmath98 .",
    "geometric quantization is a  theory which describes the intrinsic properties of the quantum state in a  geometric , coordinate - independent way .      to give geometric definition of a quantum state , the following three observations have to be taken into account :     [ fig : q ]    \\1 ) whenever a global ,",
    "lagrangian foliation @xmath97 of the phase space has been chosen , the space of fibers @xmath101 plays role of a generalized configuration space .",
    "physically , it describes independent variables ( control parameters ) of the system .",
    "the wave function is an object living on @xmath102 .",
    "description of a quantum state _ via _ such a wave function will be called the @xmath102-representation . as an example we can take the position or the momentum representation at different instants @xmath40 of time .",
    "\\2 ) to be able to calculate probabilities or transition amplitudes , we have to integrate over the configuration space @xmath102 . for this purpose",
    "people usually assume that a measure @xmath103 on @xmath102 has been chosen , such that the transition probability between @xmath104 and @xmath105 is given by their scalar product in @xmath106 , namely : @xmath107 usually one chooses the lebesgue measure carried by any system of coordinates on the configuration space .",
    "unfortunately , such a description depends upon an arbitrary choice of coordinates .",
    "even a change of units ( i.e.  centimeters _ versus _ inches ) must be compensated by an appropriate re - scaling of the wave function , cf .",
    "but only the quantity @xmath108 has a physical meaning .",
    "this quantity is independent upon all these ( arbitrary ) re - scalings .",
    "an obvious simplification of the formalism consists in `` incorporating '' the `` square root of the measure '' into the wave function .",
    "namely , we consider the intrinsic half - density @xmath109 instead of the scalar function @xmath110 .",
    "this object does not depend upon any choice of coordinates nor the choice of any measure on @xmath102 .",
    "assuming that the above half - density is locally absolutely continuous with respect to the square root of the lebesgue measure carried by any system of coordinates @xmath95 on @xmath102 , we may recover the traditional , scalar wave function @xmath110 as the ratio between @xmath111 and the reference half - density @xmath112 .",
    "complex half - densities , square - integrable , absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue , form a hilbert space which will be called @xmath113 .",
    "\\3 ) the above hilbert space can not , however , be identified with the physical space of states , because it does not reflect properly the galilei transformations of the wave function , due to the change of the reference frame . indeed ,",
    "quantum representation of the momentum @xmath114 canonically conjugate to the position @xmath115 is given by formula .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that a generalized galilei transformation : @xmath116 , must be implemented on the level of quantum mechanics by the multiplication of the wave function by the phase factor , as in formula .",
    "observe that the above galilei transformation consists in shifting the value of @xmath117 by a constant value @xmath118 in each fiber @xmath119 independently . in order to choose a specific one among all the possible canonical momenta @xmath114",
    ", we have to choose at each fiber @xmath119 the point where this observable vanishes . the collection of all these points forms a lagrangian surface @xmath120 which is transversal with respect to the foliation @xmath97 .",
    "we conclude that a choice of such a surface corresponds to a choice of a reference frame .",
    "we are going to show in the next section that each fiber @xmath119 carries a natural _ affine _ structure . choosing a specific `` reference point '' @xmath121",
    "transforms it into a _ vector _ space .",
    "moreover , we prove that this vector space ( i.e.  space tangent to the fiber @xmath122 ) is canonically equivalent to the cotangent space @xmath123 .",
    "choice of a reference frame implies , therefore , that the fibration @xmath97 acquires the vector - bundle structure isomorphic to the cotangent bundle @xmath124 .",
    "[ fig : lambda ]    suppose now that another lagrangian surface @xmath125 ( i.e.  another reference frame ) has been chosen .",
    "the difference between the two points : @xmath126 and @xmath127 , defines in each affine space @xmath122 a tangent vector or , equivalently , a covector on @xmath102 attached at @xmath122 . the collection of these covectors forms a differential 1-form on the configuration space @xmath102 , which we denote by @xmath128 .",
    "as a consequence of the fact that both surfaces @xmath129 and @xmath130 were lagrangian we obtain an obvious    * corollary * : the form @xmath128 is closed .    due to our topological assumption we have , therefore : @xmath131 which , otherwise , would be true only locally . the function @xmath132 is defined up to an additive constant .",
    "as we have already discussed in the previous sections , the elementary quantum mechanics implies that the wave functions describing the same quantum state with respect to different reference frames : @xmath133 and @xmath134 , differ by a phase factor , namely : @xmath135 where the function @xmath132 is uniquely ( up to an additive constant ) defined by the two submanifolds : @xmath130 and @xmath129 .",
    "we see that to assign a wave function to a quantum ( pure ) state , it is not sufficient to fix a `` complete system of commuting observables '' ( i.e. a  foliation @xmath97 ) but it is also necessary to choose a reference frame ( i.e. a  lagrangian surface transversal to @xmath97 ) . the same quantum state , within the same representation @xmath97 ( i.e.  position or momentum representation ) is represented by different wave functions with respect to different reference frames .",
    "this suggests the following    * definition * : quantum state in a representation @xmath97 is a class of equivalent wave functions : @xmath136\\ ] ] where the equivalence relation is given by the generalized galilei transformation : @xmath137 observe that the space @xmath138 composed of all quantum states is a projective hilbert space because a constant phase factor @xmath139 , @xmath140 , of the wave function ( i.  e.  an additive constant of @xmath141 ) is always out of control .      the coordinate - free construction of the vector - bundle structure of @xmath97 and of the phase function @xmath142 in terms of the phase - space geometry was given in @xcite .",
    "it may be briefly sketched as follows :     [ fig : f_kappa ]    given a fiber @xmath143 and a point on it , @xmath144 , vectors tangent to @xmath122 at @xmath145 can be canonically identified with covectors on @xmath102 , attached at  @xmath122 .",
