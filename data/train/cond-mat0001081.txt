    "the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) , introduced by montroll and weiss @xcite , describes different types of diffusion processes including the standard gaussian diffusion , sub diffusion @xcite and lvy walks @xcite .",
    "the ctrw has been a useful tool in many diverse fields and over the last three decades e.g. , it was used to describe transport in disorder medium @xcite and in low dimensional chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "more recently fractional kinetic equations were investigated as a tool describing phenomenologically anomalous diffusion @xcite . in these equations",
    "fractional derivatives @xcite replace ordinary integer derivatives in the standard integer kinetic equation .",

    "thus some what like ordinary random walks which can be described asymptoticly by the diffusion equation , so can the ctrw be described by fractional diffusion equation .",

    "planck equation ( ffpe ) to describe an anomalous sub - diffusion motion in an external non  linear force field . in the absence of the external force field",
    "the ffpe reduces to the fractional diffusion equation .",
    "the ffpe is an asymptotic equation which extends the ctrw to include the effect of an external force field .",
    "the ctrw itself was not designed for a description of a particle in external force field thus the ffpe describes new type of behavior not explored in depth yet .    the main result in this paper concerns a transformation of ordinary gaussian diffusion into fractional diffusion @xcite .",

    "the solution of the ffpe @xmath9 , with initial conditions concentrated on the origin , is found by transforming @xmath10 and the transformed function is the well known gaussian solution of the integer diffusion equation with initial conditions concentrated on the origin . the transformation eq .",

    "the second is the pdf @xmath15 for the iid displacements of the random walker at each step .",
    "thus the ctrw describes a process for which the particle is trapped on the origin for time @xmath16 , it then jumps to @xmath17 , it is trapped on @xmath17 for time @xmath18 and then it jumps to a new location , the process is then renewed . in what follows",
