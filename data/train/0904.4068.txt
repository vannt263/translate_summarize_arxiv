    "studies on heavy quarkonium spectroscopy have been stimulated greatly in recent years by the discovery of many hidden charm states , the so - called @xmath0 mesons  @xcite in b - factories and other experiments .",
    "the qcd - inspired interquark potential models , such as the cornell model  @xcite , are successful in predictions of charmonium and bottomonium spectra below the open flavor thresholds .",
    "however , the existence of open charm thresholds can change the charmonium spectrum significantly through the virtual charm meson loops .",
    "these coupled - channel effects were considered also in the cornell model  @xcite , and techniques were further developed by the unitaritized quark model  @xcite based on the @xmath3 quark pair creation model  @xcite . along this line and with the updated parameters ,",
    "the coupled - channel effects in the charmonium spectrum have been further studied during these years  @xcite .",
    "these studies provide important information on the identifications of the @xmath0 mesons .",
    "the quark potential model is subject to modification due to quantum fluctuation , i.e. , the creation of light quark pairs , which may be compensated by the virtual hadron loops in the coupled - channel model . for this reason , the quark potential model  @xcite , which incorporates a coulomb term at short distances and a linear confining term at large distances ,",
    "may be called as the quenched potential model . on the other hand",
    ", the vacuum polarization effect of the dynamical fermions may soften the linear potential at long distances  @xcite , and cause the screening effect , which may be discussed phenomenologically as the screened potential model  @xcite .",
    "such screening or string breaking effects have been demonstrated , although indirectly , by the simulations of unquenched lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "this effect is also implied by calculations within some holographic qcd models @xcite .",
    "the screened potential model has been used to reexamine the charmonium spectrum  @xcite recently , and it is found that the masses of higher charmonium states are lowered , compared to the quenched potential model  @xcite , and the mass suppression tends to be strengthened from lower levels to higher ones .",
    "such tendency can also be found in the calculations of the coupled - channels model , such as those in ref .",
    "it is not very surprising since , in the parton - hadron duality picture , the two models embody the same effects of light quark pairs . comparing to the screened potential model ,",
    "the coupled - channel model is more difficult to handle in practice , especially in the case when the p - wave ( and higher excited ) @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons as the intermediate states are involved .",
    "however , the latter can describe the near - threshold effect  @xcite , which has been ignored in the former .",
    "it is then interesting to compare the two models using the same quenched limit as input in the domain of charmonium spectrum .",
    "the comparison has twofold meaning : the coupled - channel model can be helpful to establish the form of the screened potential and to determine the screening parameter @xmath6 in the mass region below 4 gev , where the p - wave @xmath4 mesons are expected to be decoupled ; whereas the screened potential model can be helpful to normalize the global features of the coupled channel model in the mass region above 4 gev .    in this paper , we will compare these two models in the mass region below 4 gev for charmonium spectrum with the same quenched limit .",
    "we will introduce the two models in turn . and we will compare results of these two models numerically , and finally a summary will be given .",
    "we choose the cornell model  @xcite as the quenched limit , in which the potential has the well known form : v(r)=- + r + c , [ v : cornell]where the first term denotes the color coulomb force in the one - gluon exchange approximation due to asymptotic freedom of qcd at short distances , and the second term denotes the linear confining potential , which is consistent with both the rotating string picture  @xcite and the quenched lattice calculations ( see  @xcite for a review and references ) .",
    "the constant @xmath7 in ( [ v : cornell ] ) is the renormolization term .    in principle , one can relate the parameter @xmath8 to the running coupling constant @xmath9 in qcd , where @xmath10 is the charm quark velocity squared in the charmonium rest frame , and relate @xmath11 to the string tension @xmath12 gev@xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the regge slope in the rotating string picture  @xcite .",
    "thus , we choose _",
    "c=0.55 ,  = 0.175  ^2[parameter : cornell]in the following analysis .    to restore the hyperfine and fine structures of the charmonium spectrum",
    ", one needs to introduce the spin - dependent potential @xmath15 , which is relativistically suppressed compared to @xmath16 in ( [ v : cornell ] ) . assuming the lorentz structure of the linear confining force is of scalar type , the spin - dependent potential can be derived from ( [ v : cornell ] ) by the standard breit - fermi expansion to order @xmath17 , and has the form  @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total spin , @xmath20 the charm quark mass , and the smeared delta function is taken to be @xmath21 with @xmath22 gev  @xcite .",
    "then , the hamiltonian for the quenched potential model is given by h_0 = 2m_c++v(r)+v_sd(r ) , [ h0:charmonium]where the kinematic energy term have been included explicitly .",
    "as mentioned above , the linear confining potential will be softened by the vacuum polarization induced by the dynamical quark pair creation .",
    "such unquenched effect can be roughly accounted for by modifying the long distant behavior of @xmath23 in ( [ v : cornell ] ) . following refs .",
    "@xcite , we use the screened potential @xmath24 to substitute @xmath23 . the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ v : screened ] )",
    "is taken to be the same as that in ( [ v : cornell ] ) due to its short distance nature .",
    "the screening parameter @xmath6 sets the scale of distance at which the string breaks .",
    "we choose @xmath25 of which the inverse is about two times of the radius of @xmath4 meson .",
    "needless to say , the right hand side of ( [ v : sd ] ) should also be modified accordingly .    at short distances , the screened potential @xmath26 in ( [",
    "v : screened ] ) has the limit consistent with that of @xmath23 in ( [ v : cornell ] ) .",
    "however , the difference between the potentials increases when @xmath27 increases , and finally @xmath26 goes to a constant @xmath28 when @xmath29 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] . as a result",
    ", the charmonium spectrum in the screened potential model will be suppressed compared to that in the quenched potential model , especially for the higher exited states .",
    "furthermore , in the screened charmonium spectrum , there will be a saturation energy of about 5 - 6 gev , at which the @xmath30 quark pair can not be bound together at all .",
    "let s stress again that the parameters in ( [ parameter : cornell ] ) and ( [ mu : screening ] ) may not be the same as those chosen in  @xcite , since our purpose here is to compare the spectra in the two models rather than to get a good fit of the spectrum to the experimental data .",
    "the light quark pair creation from vacuum is assumed to share the same quantum number , @xmath31 , as the vacuum in the @xmath3 model  @xcite . in the non - relativistic limit",
    ", the @xmath3 model can be represented by the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mass of the produced quark , and @xmath34 is a constant reflecting quark pair creation strength , which can be determined phenomenologically by the ozi - allowed decay widths of charmonia  @xcite .",
    "there are no fundamental reasons to enhance the heavier quark creation relative to lighter ones , which is implied by the factor of @xmath35 in ( [ hqpc ] ) .",
    "therefore , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we use the effective strength @xmath36 for the strange quark , where @xmath37 is the ratio of constituent masses of up and down quarks(@xmath38 ) and strange quark(@xmath39 ) . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we choose @xmath40",
    ".    light quark pair creation can result in mixing between the bare charmonium state @xmath41(@xmath42 ) and the open charmed meson pair @xmath43(@xmath44 ) and @xmath7(@xmath45 ) .",
    "thus , neglecting the mixing among the bare states  @xcite , the physical state @xmath46 can be represented by @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the variable of three - momenta of the @xmath49 system .",
    "the coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 are understood to be subject to the normalization of the corresponding wave functions .",
    "the hamiltonian of this coupled - channel system can be formally written as @xmath52 here , @xmath53 has been introduced in ( [ h0:charmonium ] ) but can be different from the one in the quenched potential model by different renormalization constant @xmath7 .",
    "the hamiltonians @xmath53 and @xmath54 can only act on the states @xmath41 and @xmath49 , respectively , and give the bare spectra of them : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the so - called bare mass of the bare charmonium state and e_bc(_b,_c)=+ , provided that the inner interactions between @xmath43 and @xmath7 can be neglected . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath57 in ( [ h : ccm ] ) , which is defined in ( [ hqpc ] ) , can acts only between @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath60 in ( [ h : ccm ] ) defines the physical mass @xmath61 of the state @xmath46 as @xmath62 and the mass @xmath61 can be obtained by solving the multi - channel shrdinger equation ( [ m : defination ] ) . substituting ( [ psi : ccm])-([m_bc : defination ] ) into ( [ m : defination ] ) , one can get the integral equation [ massequation : ccm ] m+(m ) -m_0=0 , where the self - energy function @xmath63 is given by [ pi : ccm ] ( m ) = _ bcd  . when @xmath64>m_a+m_b$ ] , it is obvious that the function @xmath63 will not be real , and the imaginary part is proportional to the decay width of @xmath65",
    ". therefore , one can solve eq.([massequation : ccm ] ) in the complex plane and get the pole mass @xmath64 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "however , we will define the coupled - channel mass @xmath66 as  @xcite [ m_cou : defination ] m_cou+[(m_cou ) ] -m_0=0 , which is also called the breit - wigner mass by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing here the difference between the definitions of the bare mass in  @xcite and of ours .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite once subtract the dispersion integral in ( [ pi : ccm ] ) at @xmath67 , and absorb the term @xmath68 into the bare mass definition : [ m_0:p&w ] m_0=m_0-(m _ ) , where @xmath68 is real and positive , which can be seen directly from the definition of the function @xmath63 in ( [ pi : ccm ] ) .",
    "if the subtracted constant @xmath69 are the same for all the charmonium states @xmath70 , the bare mass @xmath71 in ( [ m_0:p&w ] ) is just a rescaling one of @xmath56 and the renormalized mass shift would not changed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the matrix element square @xmath72 in ( [ pi : ccm ] ) is simply parameterized by using a exponential form factor , and the node structure in the wave function of higher excited state is absolutely neglected . thus , the subtracted constants @xmath69 for these excited states might be overestimated , and as a result , the renormalized mass shifts in ref .",
    "@xcite are commonly smaller than those in our model , as one can seen in the following section .",
    "on the other hand , the wave functions of @xmath41 , @xmath43 and @xmath7 are needed to determine the matrix element @xmath73 in ( [ pi : ccm ] ) .",
    "these wave functions are usually chosen as the harmonic oscillator ones  @xcite .",
    "however , we determine them by solving the quenched mass equation eq.([m0:defination ] ) with eq.([h0:charmonium ] ) .",
    "but for simplicity , we will neglect the corrections due to the spin - dependent potential @xmath15 to these wave function .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : total - results ]    as mentioned in sec .",
    "i , our aim is to compare the charmonium spectra or the renormalized mass shifts [ massshifts : defination ] m_cou = m_cou - m_que ,  m_scr = m_scr - m_que , where the subscripts @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 denote the results obtained from the quenched potential model , the coupled - channels model , and the screened potential model , respectively .",
    "the quenched mass @xmath77 can be related to the bare mass @xmath56 in the coupled - channels model by the relation : [ m_que : defination ] m_que - c_que = m_0-c_cou , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 denote the renormalization constants in the quenched potential model and the coupled - channels model , respectively .",
    "thus from eq .",
    "( [ m_cou : defination ] ) , the mass shift @xmath80 can be given by [ delm_cou : relation ] m_cou=-[(m_cou)]-c_que+c_cou .",
    "to improve the reliability of the calculation of the coupled - channel model , we restrict the mass region of charmonium spectrum to be below 4 gev , in which the decays to p - wave ( and higher excited ) @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons are kinematically forbidden , and only the s - wave @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons are involved .",
    "so in the following we use the s - wave @xmath81 mesons , of which the masses are well determined and the widths can be neglected  @xcite , as the intermediate states only .    in the mass region below 4 gev , the charmonium spectrum consists of the 1s , 2s , 1p , 2p and 1d levels . for convenience , we choose the renormalization condition such that the predicted @xmath82 masses in the three models are fixed to be the measured value  @xcite , i.e. , 2980 mev .",
    "together with the inputs of the quark masses [ parameter : mq ] m_c=1.7  , m_q=0.33  , m_s=0.5  , the renormalization condition determines the constant terms in ( [ v : cornell ] ) : [ parameter : mq ] c_que=-419  , c_cou=-272  , c_scr=-403  .",
    "we list the numerical results of the mass spectra and the mass shifts in tab .  [",
    "tab : total - results ] .",
    "the subscripts @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 denote the results obtained from the quenched potential model , the coupled channel model , and the screened potential model , respectively . and",
    "the mass shifts have been defined in ( [ massshifts : defination ] ) . in tab .",
    "[ tab : total - results ] , both @xmath80 and @xmath83 have minus sign , and on the whole , they are consistent with each other .",
    "this can also be seen from fig .",
    "2 .    in addition , for the 1s , 2s , 1p and 1d levels , which either couple the @xmath4 meson pair in p - wave or lie far away from the threshold of the @xmath4 meson pair , the mass shifts @xmath80 s are comparable to each other , which is consistent with the first hadron loop theorem derived by the authors of ref .  @xcite in the approximation of equal masses for charmed mesons .",
    "however , if the @xmath42 pair couples to @xmath4 meson pair in s - wave and the mass @xmath61 calculated in the coupled channel model ( namely @xmath66 ) in ( [ pi : ccm ] ) is close to the threshold @xmath84 , the self - energy @xmath85 , then the mass shift @xmath80 , will strongly depend on @xmath86 .",
    "this is well known as the s - wave threshold effect  @xcite , and as a result , the loop theorem  @xcite will be violated .",
    "this is just the case for the 2p charmonium states , since for some of them the coupled - channel masses @xmath66 ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : total - results ] ) are close to the thresholds of the s - wave channels @xmath87 and @xmath88 channels are very small due to the small strange quark pair creation strength @xmath89 . ] .",
    "more in details , for the 2@xmath3 state ( @xmath90 ) , the coupled - channel mass @xmath91 mev , which is fairy far from the threshold of the s - wave channels @xmath92 and @xmath88 .",
    "consequently , the mass shift is as small as 33 mev . as a second example ,",
    "the coupled - channel masses of the 2@xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) and 2@xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) states are roughly equal . however , their mass shifts induced by the @xmath88 , of which the threshold is closest to their coupled - channel masses , are different by a factor of 2 ( see tab .",
    "i in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "the mass shift of 2@xmath93 state is smaller than that of 2@xmath95 state .",
    "finally , the coupled - channel effect of 2@xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) state should be most significant since the mass @xmath99 mev is very close to the threshold of @xmath100 .",
    "this result can also give support to the @xmath98 assignment of @xmath101  @xcite .",
    "[ fig2 ]   and @xmath83 varying with bare mass @xmath102.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=264 ]    it needs emphasizing here that the closeness of @xmath103 to the threshold of @xmath104 is not very sensitive to the bare mass of @xmath98 .",
    "this can be seen from fig .  3 , where the physical mass @xmath66 dependence of the unrenormalized mass shift @xmath105 $ ] for the @xmath106 state is shown .",
    "the relation between the unrenormalized mass shift and the renormalized one @xmath80 is given in ( [ delm_cou : relation ] ) . from fig .",
    "3 one can see the mass shift function is strongly dependent on the physical mass . as a result ,",
    "the slope of the mass shift curve is very large near the threshold and `` attract '' the mass @xmath103 towards the threshold .",
    "that means , if one changes the bare mass , say , by 50 mev , the change of the mass @xmath103 is only about 10 - 15 mev as can be roughly found from the figure .",
    "this is just a realization of the s - wave threshold effect  @xcite in our coupled - channels model .",
    "more precisely , the curve in fig .",
    "3 shows the cusps in the neutral and charged @xmath107 channels numerically ( see the second paper in  @xcite for more discussions ) .",
    "thus , the physical mass of @xmath98 is quite natural to be close to the threshold of @xmath104 and thus @xmath98 may be a good candidate for the @xmath101  @xcite .",

    "@xcite in tab .",
    "[ tab : total - results ] for comparison .",
    "as we have mentioned , the definition of the renormalized bare mass @xmath71 ( [ m_0:p&w ] ) is a little different from that of @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , the node effect in the wavefunction overlap integral for a higher excited charmonium decaying into charmed mesons is not considered in ref .  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the renomalized mass shift @xmath108 in  @xcite tends to be smaller than the one in ( [ delm_cou : relation ] ) for excited states as has been analyzed in the last section .",
    "furthermore , the authors of ref .  @xcite use the available results of the quenched potential model  @xcite , in which different parameters from ours are chosen , as their bare mass inputs ( the 7th column in tab .  [ tab : total - results ] ) .",
    "however , comparing the mass shifts in the 5th and 9th columns in tab .",
    "[ tab : total - results ] , one can find that they both have similar features as that of @xmath83 .",
    "this indicates that the screened potential in ( [ v : screened ] ) depicts the main feature of the vacuum polarization effect of the dynamical quark pair creation , although it fails to describe some fine structures , such as those induced by the near s - wave threshold effects .",

    ", one can see both the mass shift trajectories exhibit good behaviors , and they are roughly consistent with each other as the above analysis .",
    "however , the increase of the mass shift @xmath111 tends to be faster than that of @xmath114 in the higher mass region .",
    "this seems to indicate that the potential in ( [ v : screened ] ) somewhat overestimates the screening effect .",
    "but it is not the whole story since the p - wave ( and higher excited ) @xmath81 mesons contributions , which have been neglected , also tends to enhance the mass shift @xmath114 in the same higher mass region .",
    "we compare the charmonium spectra predicted by the coupled - channel model and the screened potential model in the mass region below 4 gev , in which the contributions from channels involving the p - wave ( and higher excited)@xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons can be neglected .",
    "we use the same quenched limit for the two models . and",

    "we find that the two models have similar global features in describing the charmonium spectrum as expected since they embody the same effect of the vacuum polarization of the dynamical quark pair creation .",
