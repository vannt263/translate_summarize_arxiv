    "absolute differential eas size spectra around the knee measured at different atmosphere depths and different zenith angles are not explained yet from the point of view of a single @xmath1 interaction model and a single model of primary energy spectra and elemental composition .",
    "such an attempt has been made in work @xcite based on an unified analysis of kascade , akeno , eas - top and ani eas size spectra .",
    "the results of approximations of primary energy spectra by rigidity - dependent steepening spectra pointed to the correctness of qgsjet interaction model and two - component composition of primary proton spectrum in the knee region .",
    "+ here , on the basis of kascade @xcite and ani @xcite eas size spectra the multi - component model of primary cosmic ray origin @xcite has been tested in the framework of method @xcite .",
    "the testing of primary energy spectra was carried out in @xmath2 pev primary energy range using @xmath3-minimization @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is detectable eas size spectra measured in @xmath6 size intervals and @xmath7 zenith angular intervals ( see fig.1 , symbols ) , @xmath8 is an energy threshold of detected eas electrons , @xmath9 is the estimation value of eas sizes obtained by detected electron lateral distribution functions at observation level ( @xmath10 ) ; + @xmath11 are the expected eas size spectra at @xmath12 energy spectra of primary nuclei ( @xmath13 ) ; + @xmath14 is a degree of freedom at @xmath15 number of unknown parameters . + the function @xmath16 in expression ( 3 )",
    "is determined in general case as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an eas size spectrum at the observation level @xmath19 for given @xmath20 parameters of a primary nucleus and depends on @xmath1 interaction model ; + @xmath21 ; @xmath22 is a probability to detect an eas by scintillation array at eas core coordinates @xmath23 , @xmath24 and to obtain estimations of eas parameters ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 - shower age , @xmath27 - shower core location ) with given accuracies ; + @xmath28 is a distribution of @xmath29 for given eas size ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "+ in most of eas experiments the eas cores are selected in @xmath31 range providing a log - gaussian form of a measuring error ( @xmath32 ) with an average value @xmath33 and rmsd @xmath34 , where @xmath35 involves all transfer factors ( an energy threshold of detected eas electrons , @xmath36 and @xmath37 contributions ) and slightly depends on @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in these cases , one may standardize the measured eas size spectra to the eas size spectra at the observation level @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the eas size power index .",
    "+ taking the above into account , the expected eas size spectra ( 3 ) can be estimated according to the expression @xmath43 where the sum is performed into limited number ( @xmath44 ) of nuclear group .",
    "energy spectra of primary nuclei ( @xmath45 ) according to the multi - component model of primary cosmic ray origin @xcite are presented in 2-component form : @xmath46 where the first component ( ism ) is derived from the explosions of normal supernova into an interstellar medium with expected rigidity - dependent power law spectra @xcite @xmath47 and the second component ( sw ) is a result of the explosions of stars into their former stellar winds with expected rigidity - dependent power law spectra @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a scale factor ( @xmath50 in tev units ) from approximations @xcite ; @xmath51 are the corresponding rigidity - dependent cut - off energies of ism - component and knee energies of sw - component ; + @xmath52 and @xmath53 are model parameters of magnetic rigidities of corresponding components and @xmath54 is the charge of @xmath39 nucleus .",
    "+ the values of model predictions @xcite for spectral parameters are : + @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 + and rigidities @xmath58 tv , @xmath59 tv at factors of uncertainty @xmath60 . + the fractions of each component ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) are determined according to @xmath63 @xmath64 at @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the expressions ( 12,13 ) are consequences of normalization of ( 8 - 10 ) to approximation of balloon and satellite data @xcite at @xmath67 tev . +        thus , minimizing @xmath3-functional ( 1 ) on the basis of measured values of @xmath68 and corresponding expected eas size spectra ( 7 ) at given @xmath69 zenith angular intervals and @xmath70 eas size intervals one may evaluate parameters of primary spectra for given ( @xmath44 ) nuclear groups .",
    "evidently , the accuracies of solutions for spectral parameters strongly depend on the number of measured intervals ( @xmath71 ) , statistical errors and correctness of @xmath72 determination in the framework of a given interaction model . moreover , the value of @xmath73 points out a reliability of applying primary model .",

    "estimations of errors of expected eas size spectra @xmath85 at fixed @xmath86 parameters did not exceed @xmath87 .",

    "+ moreover , power indices @xmath92 were changed too in the range of the model uncertainty and the relative uncertainties of expected spectra ( @xmath93 ) in the @xmath3-minimization ( 1 ) we set equal to 3% .",
    "the testing of primary model predictions by minimizations ( 1 ) were carried out on the basis of kascade @xcite ( @xmath941020 g/@xmath83 ) and ani @xcite ( 700 g/@xmath83 ) eas size spectra at 5 zenith angular intervals .",

    "the systematic underestimations of kascade ( @xmath110 ) and ani ( @xmath109 ) eas size spectra ( see expression ( 6 ) ) one may explain by energy thresholds of detected eas electrons ( @xmath111 mev for kascade and @xmath112 mev for ani experiments ) .",
    "+ the values of spectral parameters obtained by approximations of ani data agree with corresponding parameters obtained from approximations of kascade data except for cut - off energy @xmath113 tev at ani data analysis .",
    "predictions of 2-component model of the cosmic ray origin and qgsjet high energy interaction model allow us to explain the measured eas size spectra in the knee region with accuracy better than 10% .",
    "+        all model parameters of 2-component primary energy spectra , obtained from eas data agree with theoretical predictions @xcite in the frames of standard errors with the exception of @xmath114 parameters .",
    "obtained spectral slopes ( @xmath115 ) after the knee of sw - component are significantly steeper than 2-component model predictions ( @xcite , @xmath116 ) and this result requires of further investigations .",
    "the authors wish to thank many colleagues from experiments ani and kascade for providing eas data .",
