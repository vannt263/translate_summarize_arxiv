    "the buildup of stellar mass in dark matter halos has been measured in the local universe with a variety of methods , indirectly with abundance matching techniques @xcite and more directly with measurements of stellar and total masses of individual halos @xcite .",
    "these stellar mass  halo mass relations provide strong constraints on models of galaxy formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while much of the attention has been focussed on the stellar content of @xmath9 halos , recent work has highlighted the relevance of the higher mass scales represented by groups and clusters , where various feedback processes are predicted to operate .",
    "@xcite for instance show discrepancies between stellar - to - halo mass ratios computed for clusters from abundance matching and from direct observations .",
    "meanwhile , at @xmath10 , @xcite measure a dramatic increase in the number density of galaxy groups over an epoch when star formation activity is greatly diminished , both in relative intensity ( i.e. , ssfr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in the number of galaxies that display active levels of star formation at a fixed mass",
    ". given that these massive halos at high redshift represent sites where galaxies are quenched at levels above that in the field @xcite , an analysis of environmental trends provides insight into the mechanisms that contribute toward the growth of the red sequence . directly measuring the mass scales of these halos in which galaxies undergo quenching will provide stronger constraints on the relevant mechanisms than indirect methods for inferring halo membership and halo mass scales .    the two relevant measurements for directly probing group mass scales are the halo mass and the total group stellar mass .",
    "at high redshift , reliable detection of galaxy groups as well as halo mass estimates require deep x - ray imaging .",
    "we therefore utilize the ultra deep chandra+xmm newton group catalog in the cdfs of @xcite . to find galaxies within these groups , we require a survey with sufficient redshift precision , which is uniform , and which has well - characterized completeness corrections to relatively low stellar masses .",
    "the carnegie - spitzer - imacs ( csi ) survey @xcite meets these criteria and is used in this work .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath11  km  s@xmath12  mpc@xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "stellar masses are based on a @xcite imf .",
    "we utilize combined chandra and xmm - newton x - ray observations in the cdfs @xcite to select groups at high redshift .",
    "these observations represent the deepest x - ray data to date . for the analysis presented here",
    ", we cull the list of @xmath15 x - ray groups from @xcite to those with redshifts in the range @xmath2  and flags of @xmath16 or @xmath17 , indicating well defined centroids and redshift determinations from followup spectroscopy .",
    "in addition , we include only those groups with csi coverage in the ecdfs , out of @xmath18  sq  degs in the swire cdfs field .",
    "only @xmath19 groups remain in the catalog .",
    "total masses , @xmath20 , given in @xcite are estimated from the @xmath21 relation in @xcite , which was calibrated with weak lensing based mass estimates in the cosmos field .",
    "though the lowest halo masses were derived by extrapolating the latter relation , @xcite confirmed the reliability of the halo mass estimates from stacked weak lensing and clustering analyses . @xmath22",
    "values follow from these mass estimates .",
    "we utilize a redshift catalog in the cdfs constructed from new csi observations .",
    "the handling of the data is similar to that in the xmm - lss field @xcite , though our deep decam photometry provides for more uniform completeness as a function of magnitude .",
    "briefly , csi targets were selected in the _ spitzer _ irac 3.6  band with magnitudes brighter than @xmath23  ab  mag and observed with the uniform dispersion prism ( udp ) on imacs @xcite at magellan .",
    "redshifts were measured by fitting the available spectrophotometry ( spectrum  @xmath24 ) with seds generated from stellar population synthesis models . in comparisons with high - resolution redshifts from @xcite we find a biweight scatter of @xmath25 for both red and blue galaxies . at @xmath26 ,",
    "the stellar mass completeness limit is @xmath27 .",
    "we note that group numbers @xmath28 and @xmath29 do not contain csi galaxies above the mass cut of @xmath30  ( some galaxies may have been missed due to slit collisions and other sources of incompleteness ) , though both contain galaxies below this limit .",
    "these are both the lowest mass groups in the sample with halo mass estimates of @xmath31  @xmath32 .",
    "also , number 63 had a large uncertainty on the stellar mass estimate ( see below ) .",
    "we exclude these groups from our analysis leaving a total sample of 20 x - ray groups in the cdfs .",
    "the spectroscopic completeness for csi in the cdfs is @xmath33 over @xmath34  ab  mag and a broad range of color . to accurately account for galaxies that were not observed with the udp or which did not have well constrained redshifts ,",
    "galaxies are assigned weights according to their inverse completeness in bins of observed magnitude ( @xmath35 $ ] ) , observed color ( @xmath36 $ ] ) , and local source density ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    even though the cdfs has been extensively studied by other surveys , with numerous high - resolution redshifts available in the literature ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) , we refrain from combining the multiple available datasets .",
    "the different selection functions in other work would make it difficult to produce a homogeneous dataset from the aggregate of all the available surveys , despite potentially boosting the level of completeness .",
    "the depth and homogeneity of the csi data simplify the analysis , and the relatively uniform @xmath33 completeness is high enough to robustly characterize the stellar mass content of these x - ray groups .",
    "lastly , while other works have used photometric catalogs to assemble or calibrate galaxy samples in groups in the cdfs ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our sample is exclusively spectroscopic .      for each x - ray group",

    ", the completeness correction accurately reproduces galaxy counts to within @xmath40 , an uncertainty that is factored into the total error budget on the aggregate stellar mass measurements .    to account for galaxies below our stellar mass completeness limit",
    ", we correct these group stellar masses assuming a schechter function with @xmath41 and @xmath42 . integrating down to @xmath43  @xmath32  we find a correction factor of @xmath44 .",
    "changing @xmath45 and @xmath46 within reasonable ranges yields an uncertainty of @xmath47 in this correction , which is added to the error budget .",
    "we derive a contamination correction for every group by subtracting off the stellar mass contribution from foreground and background galaxies .",
    "we measured the stellar mass within circular apertures of radius @xmath22 at spatial locations that did not overlap with other groups near @xmath48 .",
    "we compute the aggregate stellar mass of galaxies at @xmath49 in these apertures and take the mean and standard deviation to represent the background and its uncertainty ( typically @xmath50 ) .    after measuring the stellar mass within @xmath22 , we correct the value to that expected within @xmath51 assuming a spherically symmetric nfw profile @xcite seen in projection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* see their equation  7 ) .",

    "the range of typical concentration values associated with high mass halos ( @xmath54 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) impacts the correction factor by only @xmath55 and therefore does not significantly affect our results or conclusions .",
    "lastly , there is an additional source of uncertainty due to the statistical uncertainties in the individual mass measurements .",
    "the typical statistical uncertainty , based on repeat udp observations and spectrophotometric sed fitting , is @xmath56  dex per galaxy .",
    "this does not include contributions due to systematic effects such as different stellar population synthesis models and imf variations .",

    "we standardize the group stellar masses in cosmos with ours in the cdfs by measuring them in the same manner as described in the previous section and using the photometric redshifts and stellar masses from @xcite .",
    "while this approach differs from summing redshift likelihood functions within the redshift windows of the groups , as carried out in @xcite , there is very good agreement between the two methods with a scatter in the aggregate stellar masses of only @xmath61  dex and a negligible offset .",
