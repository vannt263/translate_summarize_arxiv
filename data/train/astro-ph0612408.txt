[ spec_dbsp_sn ] the spectrum of sn1991 t ( filippenko et al . 1992 ) at nine  days from maximum light redshifted by @xmath90kms@xmath3 , and the spectrum of sn2006gy at 42 days since discovery , after the subtraction of third - degree polynomials fitted to each spectrum",

    "this value , along with the synthetic spectral models of vazdekis ( 1999 ) , suggests that the metallicity of ngc1260 is not low , [ fe / h]@xmath103 .",
    "with estimated peak absolute magnitude of @xmath104 , sn2006gy is probably the brightest sn ever observed .",
    "the slow brightening , the peak luminosity and the h@xmath1 emission line and the possible sn - ia - like features suggest that sn2006gy maybe related to the hybrid iin / ia sne class ( also known as type - iia ; deng et al .",
    "the other possible members in the type - iia group are sn2002ic ( hamuy et al .",
    "2003 ) sn2005gj ( aldering et al .",
    "2006 ) ; sn1997cy ( germany et al . 2000 ) and sn1999e ( rigon et al . 2003 ) .    any model of sn2006gy",
    "has to explain the spectral lines , the extra - ordinary peak luminosity of @xmath105ergs@xmath3 ( after correction for extinction ) , and a radiated energy over the first two months of @xmath106erg ( assuming 11,000-k black body which roughly matches the rayleigh - jeans slope in dbsp spectra ) .",
    "we note that even if the extinction in ngc1260 was overestimated and the sn light suffers only from galactic extinction , the total radiated energy within the first two months is about @xmath107erg .",
    "the high peak luminosity suggests that the blast wave from the explosion efficiently converts the mechanical energy to radiation .",
    "this mean the shock has to be radiative which requires the circum - stellar medium ( csm ) density to exceed @xmath108 .",
    "moreover , the conversion of mechanical energy of an explosion to radiation requires that the ejecta sweep up matter with comparable mass .",
    "the slow rise time , @xmath109d to peak luminosity implies that the dense region has a size of at least @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the speed of the blast wave .",
    "the peak luminosity , @xmath112 , requires density of the order , @xmath113@xmath114 . assuming an upper limit on @xmath115 of @xmath116cms@xmath3 at early times , the minimum mass contained within this radius is @xmath117m@xmath118 .",
    "the gradual decrease in the radiated energy , and possibly lower expansion velocities would easily bring it closer to a solar mass .",
    "the mass loss rate by the progenitor has to be stupendous , @xmath119 , over a time scale of at least about @xmath120yr , where @xmath121kms@xmath3 is the speed of the progenitor wind ( smith et al .",
    "2006 ; @xmath122@xmath123kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "finally , the high csm density accounts for the lack of substantial x - ray and radio emission ( being absorbed by photoelectric and free - free absorption , respectively ) .",
    "sn2006gy shares some properties with type - iia and type iin sne .",
    "type - iin sne are most plausibly the result of a core collapse sn embedded in dense csm , while iia events have been explained as thermo - nuclear explosions taking place in a dense medium ( e.g. , livio & riess 2003 ; han & podsiadlowski 2006 ) .",
    "the thermo - nuclear model is attractive from a spectroscopic perspective . in the context of type - ia sne ,",
    "a possible explanation to the high - mass loss rate is that it is the result of a common - envelope phase in a binary system ( e.g. , taam & ricker 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "this scenario was suggested by livio & riess ( 2003 ) to explain the properties of sn2002ic , and is consistent with the inferred high mass loss rate and its velocity ( i.e. , @xmath124kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "however , this scenario requires the ejection of matter from the progenitor to shortly precede the sn explosion ( chugai & yungelson 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , the total kinetic energy of ia events is limited to about @xmath81@xmath125erg ( khokhlov et al . 1993 ) , and it can get up to @xmath126erg for super - chandrasekhar models ( cf . yoon & langer 2004 ) . therefore , unless we considerably over - estimated the extinction , the total radiated energy of sn2006gy in the first two months alone is challenging for type - ia - like sn models .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , noting that the envelope of a massive star ( @xmath127m@xmath128 ) contains a reservoir of thermal energy that can power the sn , suggested that such a star was the progenitor of sn2006gy .",
    "however , most of the thermal energy will be lost due to expansion and the ability of the photons to leak out is limited by the long diffusion timescale for photons ( @xmath129months ; e.g. , kulkarni 2005 ) .",
    "therefore , it will be difficult for this specific model ( alone ) to explain the high peak luminosity of sn2006gy .    along the general lines of previous suggestion by benetti et al .",
    "( 2006 ; for sn2002ic ) and smith et al .",
    "( 2006 ; for sn2006gy ) , we speculate that the large energy budget for sn2006gy may hint at a highly energetic explosion ( @xmath130erg ) , from a massive stellar progenitor . two possibilities",
    "are an csm - embedded collapsar ( e.g. , woosley & macfadyen 1999 ) , or a pair production sn ( e.g. , ober et al .",
    "1983 ; smith et al .",
    "pair production sne , however , require low - metallicity progenitors , but it may be possible to overcome this requirement by the merger of two massive stars .",
    "we further speculate that such a merger may be responsible to the high mass - loss rate ( e.g. , common envelope ejection ) .",
    "sn2006gy and other iia ( and maybe many iin ) events may result from one of these energetic explosions that are able to produce @xmath130erg .",
    "the general issues of the large energy release into a dense csm have been discussed for some type iin events ( e.g. , chugai et al .",
    "2004 , gal - yam et al .",
    "2006 ) . for reasons we do not understand the explosion is preceded by a phase of stupendous mass loss .",
    "the mass and geometry of the hydrogen envelope may determines the outcome of the explosion ( e.g. , iia or iin ) .",
    "finally , the rarity of such energetic sne reflect the rarity of the progenitors .",
