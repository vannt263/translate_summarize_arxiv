    "nearly fifty years ago , the @xmath2 puzzle led gell - mann and pais @xcite to discover that interaction ( or flavor ) eigenstates need not coincide with particles having well - defined masses and lifetimes .",
    "the concept of flavor - mixing was born .",
    "pais and piccioni @xcite went one step further and suggested that the propagation of a flavor eigenstate , as a coherent superposition of mass eigenstates , leads to the partial conversion of the initial flavor into other flavors .",
    "the flavor - mixing transition probability oscillates in space with a wavelength depending on the mass differences .",
    "the theory of flavor - mixing and particle oscillations was soon vindicated in a series of experiments on the kaon system @xcite .",
    "similar oscillations were observed in 1987 with @xmath1 mesons @xcite .    by analogy ,",
    "pontecorvo proposed in 1957 the hypothesis of neutrino - antineutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "neutrino flavor - mixing , strictly speaking , was suggested somewhat later @xcite , and the two - flavor oscillation case , as well as its application to solar neutrinos , was examined at the end of the sixties by pontecorvo and gribov @xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillations are , however , much more difficult to observe than meson oscillations , because of the small masses and the weak interactions of the neutrinos .",
    "they remained for thirty years a theoretical subject ( see for example the reviews @xcite ) , with the noteworthy exception of the solar neutrino experiment in the homestake mine @xcite .",
    "in the 90 s , the persistent deficit in solar neutrinos ( in comparison with the predictions of solar models @xcite ) observed at homestake was confirmed by the experiments kamiokande - ii @xcite , sage @xcite , gallex @xcite , gno @xcite and super - kamiokande @xcite .",
    "moreover the sudbury neutrino observatory recently announced the detection of a nonelectronic component in the solar neutrino flux @xcite , the total flux being compatible with the predictions of solar models .",
    "all these observations can be explained by neutrino mixing and oscillations @xcite on another length scale , the observation of an angular dependence of the atmospheric muon - neutrino flux by the super - kamiokande collaboration @xcite gave a huge impetus to the neutrino oscillation hypothesis ( note that a global muon - neutrino depletion had already been observed in other atmospheric neutrino experiments @xcite ) .",
    "preliminary results from the long - baseline experiment k2k @xcite confirm these results by showing a depletion in an artificially produced muon - neutrino beam .",
    "finally , controversial evidence for neutrino oscillations has appeared in the laboratory experiment lsnd @xcite but has not been confirmed ( nor totally excluded ) by the karmen experiment @xcite .",
    "particle oscillations are an interference phenomenon which allows the measurement of extremely small quantities , such as masses too small to be measurable by other means ( mass differences between conjugate mesons @xcite or neutrinos @xcite ) , or cp violation ( measured nearly forty years ago in neutral meson systems @xcite and yet to be measured in the leptonic sector @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is a privileged tool in the discovery of new physics .",
    "nowadays , @xmath1 meson and neutrino oscillations have a huge importance in the determination of the unknown parameters of the standard model and its minimal extension , in particular the mixing matrix elements ( including the cp violation phase ) and the neutrino masses . besides serving as a delicate probe in particle physics , particle oscillations are a good testing ground for quantum mechanics .",
    "einstein - podolsky - rosen correlations @xcite have been studied theoretically @xcite as well as experimentally @xcite in the neutral @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems .",
    "bell inequalities for neutral kaons are the subject of active research @xcite .",
    "furthermore , fundamental issues of quantum mechanics are raised by oscillation experiments .",
    "the determination of the conditions under which the coherence between the different mass eigenstates is maintained is crucial for the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "the question of the correlation between neutral mesons , in processes where @xmath3 is included in the final state , is important for an estimate of the oscillation frequency @xcite .    considering the practical importance of the oscillations ,",
    "the theoretical framework describing them should be rock - solid .",
    "surprisingly , the validity of the standard treatment of oscillations , resorting to plane waves in a simple quantum - mechanical model , was not seriously questioned until neutrino oscillations finally gained credibility in the 90 s .",
    "two pioneering articles should be noted .",
    "first , a quantum field model of kaon oscillations was proposed by sachs in 1963 @xcite , but was soon forgotten , until the use of sachs reciprocal basis was recently revived for a rigorous quantum - mechanical treatment of meson oscillations @xcite .",
    "second , kayser showed in 1981 that neutrino oscillations are in contradiction with the plane wave assumption of the standard treatment of oscillations , and he proposed to modelize the oscillating particles with wave packets @xcite .",
    "his model , however , was not widely accepted and numerous articles have continued to appear to this day , discussing the ambiguities of the plane wave standard treatment , such as the proper choice of the frame @xcite or the equality of the energies or momenta of the different mass eigenstates @xcite .",
    "although kayser s wave packet model is a serious improvement on the standard plane wave treatment , it also suffers from serious defects : flavor states are ill - defined @xcite ; the nonrelativistic limit is problematic if the mass eigenstates are not nearly degenerate @xcite ; the question about the equality ( or not ) of the energy of the different mass eigenstates is not answered @xcite ; the possibility remains of obtaining nonstandard oscillation formulas @xcite ; the relation between the coherence length , beyond which oscillations vanish , and the conditions of production and detection is vague ( problem of the determination of the wave packet size @xcite ) ; finally , it is not adequate for the oscillations of unstable particles .    in order to solve these problems , a quantum field treatment of neutrino oscillations , similar to sachs s model ,",
    "has been proposed by giunti , kim , lee and lee @xcite .",
    "the model consists in treating the oscillating particle as an internal line of a feynman diagram , propagating between a source and a detector , which are represented by ingoing and outgoing external wave packets .",
    "this approach has been followed by other authors , but no agreement has yet been reached on the correct assumptions and calculation methods :    1 .",
    "there is disagreement on whether the interfering mass eigenstates have the same energy @xcite or whether their energy is spread ; the existence of propagating wave packets , associated to the mass eigenstates , is also at stake @xcite .",
    "2 .   whereas oscillations vanish if the 3-momentum is measured too accurately , it is not clear whether the same thing happens when the energy is perfectly measured @xcite .",
    "nonstandard formulas for neutrino oscillations have been derived in specific cases , either showing a strong dependence of the flavor - mixing transition probability on the neutrino mass ratios @xcite , or having a ` plane wave ' behavior @xcite , or leading to oscillations of charged leptons in pion decay @xcite .",
    "moreover , this formalism can not be applied , as it is , to meson oscillations or to unstable neutrinos .",
    "the existence of neutrino mass makes indeed not only neutrino mixing possible but also neutrino decay @xcite .",
    "although it can not alone explain the data , neutrino decay has a long history as a possible explanation for the solar neutrino anomaly @xcite .",
    "moreover this hypothesis was compatible until recently with atmospheric neutrino data @xcite , although it now seems ruled out @xcite .",
    "neutrino decay has also been discussed with respect to supernovae @xcite .    in this report",
    ", we intend to reconcile the different field - theoretical treatments in order to solve the above problems .",
    "our first aim is to argue in favor of a field theory approach of oscillations .",
    "we want to show that it provides , on the one hand , the best available derivation of the oscillation formula and gives , on the other hand , a good explanation of the characteristics of the oscillation process ( origin of the oscillations , observability conditions , boundary conditions ) .",
    "our second aim is to strengthen the phenomenological basis of the neutrino oscillation formula through its unification with the mesonic oscillation formula .",
    "we thus extend the formalism to the unstable case , so that the same formula can be applied to k and b mesons , to neutrinos and to unstable neutrinos .    in section  [ section1 ] , we discuss the quantum - mechanical approaches , so as to understand the problems addressed in most of the articles and the different solutions adopted in the literature .",
    "the existing field - theoretical treatments are reviewed in section  [ section2 ] , and their contradictions are summarized in five questions , which will serve as a guideline in the calculations of sections [ section3 ] to [ section5 ] ; these questions will be answered in section [ answers ] and [ section9 ] . in sections [ section3 ] and [ section4 ] , we explain all the assumptions behind the external wave packet model .",
    "the relativistic case and the nonrelativistic ( but nearly mass degenerate ) cases are treated in a unified way , and the oscillating particle is allowed to be unstable .",
    "oscillations of stable particles are analyzed in section  [ section5 ] . with the aim of reconciling the different points of view in the literature , we discuss different methods of computation , which allow to piece together a complete physical interpretation in section  [ section6 ] .",
    "we shall see that this formalism lends itself to a wave packet interpretation of the oscillating particle and can thus take up the physical insights of kayser s intermediate wave packet model .",
    "the dispersion ( or spreading in space - time of the amplitude ) is taken into account , as it is important for mesons and might be relevant for solar and supernova neutrinos .",
    "we can then show that the existence of the coherence length is due not only to the separation of wave packets , but also to their dispersion .",
    "we compute the explicit dependence of the coherence length on the conditions of production and detection , to check that it increases without bound with the accuracy of energy measurements .",
    "we also show in which sense the oscillation formula can be seen as a superposition of mass eigenstates with the same energy , in order to clear up the misunderstanding of stationary boundary conditions .",
    "in addition , we analyze in section  [ section6 ] the nonstandard oscillation formulas derived within field - theoretical models and we disprove them .",
    "oscillations of unstable particles are examined in section  [ section7 ] .",
    "nonexponential corrections to mixing are computed for the first time in quantum field theory , and they are shown to be negligible .",
    "we clearly state the correspondence between the field - theoretical treatment and the wigner - weisskopf and reciprocal basis formalisms .",
    "some more topics are discussed in section  [ section8 ] : the normalization of the transition probability , the size of the external wave packets and the instability of the source . finally , we examine correlated oscillations ( da@xmath4ne , kekb and babar experiments ) in section  [ section9 ] , including an analysis of the possible energy - momentum correlation at the source . in the same framework ,",
    "oscillations of recoil particles are shown to be nonexistent .",
    "let us mention four restrictions .",
    "first , we shall only consider free propagation in vacuum .",
    "interactions with background matter can have a dramatic effect on mixing , as demonstrated by the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( or msw ) effect @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the msw oscillations are washed out by averaging over the energy spectrum @xcite , so that the question of intrinsic decoherence discussed in the present report is not very important in that case .",
    "it is true that a field - theoretical formalism for oscillations with matter interactions should be developed to deal with dense astrophysical environments @xcite , but this goes far beyond the limits of this review .",
    "second , we shall not explain the nonperturbative quantum field theory of particle oscillations , as proposed by blasone , vitiello and co - workers @xcite .",
    "this approach is indeed of a completely different nature than the perturbative field - theoretical treatments discussed in this report .",
    "we shall however comment on their results in section [ review ] .",
    "third , we shall not examine exotic mechanisms , such as oscillations of massless neutrinos due to a violation of the equivalence principle @xcite , to resonant spin - flavor precession @xcite , to flavor - changing ( or non - universal ) interactions @xcite or to dissipation @xcite ( comparative reviews can be found in @xcite ) . finally , we consider neither the gravitational effects on oscillations @xcite nor the possibility of extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "we first discuss the concept of particle mixing as it is a requirement for oscillations .",
    "we then present the standard derivation of the oscillation formula , stressing the problematic choice of basis for unstable particles , as well as the ambiguities arising in the conversion of an oscillation in time into an oscillation in space .",
    "this section ends with a review of the attempts to solve these problems with more sophisticated quantum - mechanical models .",
    "the possibility of particle mixing arises from the fundamental principles of quantum theory .",
    "the measurement of an observable causes the initial state to jump into an eigenstate of the operator associated to this observable .",
    "thus the act of measurement determines a basis of physical states , made up of all the eigenstates of the corresponding operator .",
    "the different bases associated to the different operators are linked by linear transformations ; a state expanded in a given basis can be seen as a _ mixing _ of the eigenstates of that basis .",
    "while one gets used to the quantum superposition principle as long as wave functions correspond to rather abstract properties of a system , it is always a bit shocking to apply it to particles , which are associated in our mind with classical concepts .",
    "the two - slit experiment with particles is the best known example , but particle mixing , appearing when an interacting eigenstate is a superposition of different mass eigenstates , is hardly less unsettling .",
    "the textbook case is given by the neutral kaon system : the decay pattern of a @xmath5 into pions is well explained by the superposition of two mass eigenstates , a cp - even state decaying quickly into two pions , and a cp - odd state decaying more slowly into three pions . thus a @xmath5 can be seen as a mixing of a @xmath6 ( _ k short _ ) and a @xmath7 ( _ k long _ ) , having well - defined masses and widths ( the so - called mass eigenstate basis ) .",
    "whereas pionic decays do not allow to identify the final strangeness ( @xmath5 or @xmath8 ) , it is possible to do so in the decays of kaons into @xmath9 , with the result that one observes a nonnegligible probability to detect a transition from the initial @xmath5 into a @xmath8 .",
    "this is the phenomenon referred to as _",
    "particle oscillation_. the flavor - mixing transition probability oscillates indeed with the propagation distance , unless the oscillation is averaged by some mechanism , in which case the transition probability simply follows the exponential decay law for each mass eigenstate .",
    "particle oscillations can be compared to a 2-slit interference experiment , which requires firstly that several paths must be available to a particle , and secondly that these paths should not be distinguishable by the experimental conditions . in particle oscillations ,",
    "the different mass eigenstates are the analogue of the different paths , since they are eigenstates of the space - time evolution operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "of course , their other quantum numbers should be equal .",
    "the equivalent of the second requirement is that the masses should not be distinguishable by the experimental apparatus . under these conditions ,",
    "the probability to observe the propagating particle in a given state , other than a mass eigenstate , oscillates in space ( and in time ) with a wavelength inversely proportional to the mass difference , because of the interference between the mass eigenstate amplitudes .",
    "thus particle oscillations occur _ if _ the initial and final states are not mass eigenstates _ and if _ it is impossible to ascertain which mass eigenstate has contributed as an intermediate state .",
    "this last assumption implies that mass differences should be much smaller than the typical energies involved in the processes , with the result that the oscillation wavelength is macroscopically large and the particle oscillates over macroscopic distances .    of course",
    ", oscillations are only observable in processes where the propagation distance is of the order of , or much larger than , the oscillation wavelength .",
    "otherwise it is perfectly adequate to work with interaction ( or flavor ) eigenstates , as it has been done until now with neutrinos in accelerator experiments .",
    "note that one often talks about particle oscillations even if the oscillation term is averaged by some mechanism , such as an integration over the energy spectrum , though this situation could be more appropriately called _",
    "incoherent mixing_.    let us be more precise about the basis pertaining to the oscillation phenomenon .",
    "the hamiltonian should be such that it can be split into a propagation hamiltonian @xmath12 , describing the free propagation of the particle , and an interaction hamiltonian @xmath13 , describing the interactions producing the propagating particle .",
    "these two subsets of the hamiltonian can be distinguished if there exists a quantum number , called _ flavor _",
    ", conserved by @xmath13 , but violated by @xmath12 .",
    "the appropriate basis for the production of the particle is made up of eigenstates of both @xmath13 and the flavor operator .",
    "it is called the _ flavor basis_. the basis relevant to the propagation of the particle is the one in which @xmath12 is diagonal and is called the _ propagation basis _ , or _ mass basis_. this basis does not coincide with the flavor basis , since the flavor operator does not commute with @xmath12 .",
    "the simplest example is given by stable neutrinos , in which case the hamiltonian @xmath12 includes the mass matrix , whereas the hamiltonian @xmath13 includes the weak interactions of the neutrinos with the bosons @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the flavor is here the leptonic number , which can be electronic , muonic or tauic and maybe sterile .",
    "this number is conserved by the weak interactions , but is violated by a non - degenerate mass matrix which mixes neutrinos of different flavors .    as regards unstable particles ,",
    "the wigner - weisskopf method @xcite is used to build a non - hermitian effective hamiltonian @xmath12 , with the aim of describing both propagation and decay .",
    "@xmath13 includes the interactions involved in the production of the oscillating particles . in the case of",
    "neutral @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) mesons , @xmath12 includes , on the one hand , the degenerate effective mass matrix ( due to yukawa , strong and electromagnetic interactions ) and , on the other hand , the weak interactions causing the decay and the flavor - mixing transitions @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 ) .",
    "@xmath13 is an effective hamiltonian describing the strong interactions of the mesons ; it can be built with chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the flavor is here the strangeness ( or bottomness ) with values @xmath18 , which is conserved by strong interactions but violated by weak interactions .",
    "the non - hermiticity of @xmath12 means that the neutral meson system does not evolve in isolation , because of its possible decay .",
    "the relationship between the propagation and flavor basis can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the matrix diagonalizing @xmath12 , if this hamiltonian has been expressed from the start in the flavor basis .",
    "the states are the propagation ( or mass ) eigenstates , at time @xmath21 , with well - defined masses and widths , belonging to the propagation basis , whereas the states are the flavor eigenstates .",
    "the properties of the matrix @xmath20 depend on the hamiltonian @xmath12 . in the case of a stable oscillating particle ,",
    "the matrix @xmath20 arises from the diagonalization of the mass matrix and is unitary . in the case of an unstable oscillating particle",
    ", @xmath12 is necessarily non - hermitian , as explained above , so that the time evolution is nonunitary , i.e.  the oscillating particle is allowed to decay .",
    "the matrix @xmath20 diagonalizing that hamiltonian is generally not unitary , although it can be unitary if some symmetry makes the hamiltonian normal is normal if @xmath22=0 . ]",
    "@xcite .",
    "the computation of an amplitude requires the knowledge of the scalar product values of the eigenstates . in the flavor basis , the following orthogonality properties hold : @xmath23 since @xmath13 is hermitian and commutes with the flavor operator . in the propagation basis",
    ", @xmath12 is hermitian only if the oscillating particle is stable .",
    "thus the scalar product of the flavor eigenstates must be defined by transforming the flavor scalar products ( [ orthogsaveur ] ) : @xmath24 these scalar products become orthogonal if the matrix @xmath20 is unitary , which is true if the particle is stable or , more generally , if @xmath12 is normal . in the example of neutral kaons ,",
    "the approximation of cp symmetry makes @xmath12 normal and @xmath20 unitary . since the violation of this symmetry is of the order of @xmath25 , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ orthogmasse ] ) is of the same order in the neutral kaon system .",
    "this lack of orthogonality implies that the states can be normalized in different ways .",
    "the normalization factors do not matter as long as they do not appear in the final result .",
    "a normalization problem arises however in the case of unstable particles if we try to compute an amplitude involving a mass eigenstate in the initial or final state .",
    "for example , the amplitude depends on the normalization chosen for the state . in that case ,",
    "the normalization ambiguity is of the order of the direct cp violation parameter @xmath26 , so that it can not be neglected @xcite .",
    "this problem does not arise in the field - theoretical approach , where the kaons are considered as intermediate states , which are not directly observed .",
    "it must be stressed that the orthogonality properties in the flavor basis are valid only if all mass eigenstates are kinematically allowed @xcite .",
    "for example , let us suppose that there are four stable neutrinos such that @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29gev . under 1  gev , the flavor scalar products become @xmath30",
    "this difficulty is a first indication of the problems arising in the definition of a flavor basis .",
    "is it really possible to interpret a flavor eigenstate as an observable particle ?",
    "in quantum mechanics , each stable particle can be associated with an irreducible representation of the poincar group , with a given mass and a given spin . in that framework",
    ", the flavor eigenstates do not correspond to particles , unless they are degenerate in mass .",
    "the problem is not easier to solve in quantum field theory .",
    "whereas creation and annihilation operators of mass eigenstates are well - defined , the transformation ( [ chgtbase ] ) does not yield creation and annihilation operators of flavor states that satisfy canonical commutation relations @xcite .",
    "one could thus wonder whether flavor eigenstates really exist or not .",
    "a phenomenological argument in favor of their existence is that , for obvious practical reasons , no one has yet devised an experiment involving only one mass eigenstate of a system of oscillating particles ) would have then allowed a nonambiguous determination of the propagating eigenstate . ] . on the contrary ,",
    "oscillating particles are produced and detected in a superposition of mass eigenstates formally equivalent to a flavor eigenstate . in that sense , flavor eigenstates",
    "are observed , whereas mass eigenstates are not .",
    "the case of an unstable particle differs from the stable case in two respects .",
    "first , the decay widths of the propagating eigenstates can vary greatly , allowing the isolation of a nearly pure beam of the longest - lived eigenstate ( so the phenomenologist is tempted to declare this state ` observable ' ) .",
    "second , there is no state corresponding to an unstable particle in the hilbert space of physical states .",
    "these particles are best described by s - matrix poles in quantum field theory ( so the theoretician is tempted to declare these unstable states ` not observable ' ) .",
    "many articles and books give derivations of the oscillation formula with plane wave states ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this section and in the next ,",
    "we examine this method in its fine details , emphasizing subtle points and doubtful assumptions .    following the rules of quantum mechanics ,",
    "the transition probability between an initial state of flavor @xmath31 at time @xmath21 and position @xmath32 and a final state of flavor @xmath33 at time @xmath34 and position @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the hamiltonian operator and @xmath38 is the generator of translations .",
    "the states are taken to be energy - momentum eigenstates , so that a plane wave treatment will follow .",
    "this amplitude can be computed with the help of the change of basis ( [ chgtbase ] ) : @xmath39 where the phase is given by @xmath40 and the decay term is defined by @xmath41 the symbols @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 stand for the energy , momentum , mass and width of the mass eigenstate .",
    "the factor @xmath46 is often dropped , either because the mass eigenstate is assumed to be in its rest frame ( the time @xmath34 is then the proper time ) , or because of an assumption of equal momenta for all mass eigenstates ( the factor @xmath46 then does not appear in the probability ) . these assumptions can not be justified and neither will be assumed in the following derivation .    if the particle is unstable , @xmath12 is an effective hamiltonian , computed with the wigner - weisskopf method in the rest frame of the decaying particle .",
    "hence , the phase depends on the proper time , @xmath47 , so that a boost is necessary to obtain the expressions ( [ phasephij ] ) and ( [ decayterm ] ) valid in the laboratory frame .",
    "however the concept of a rest frame has no meaning in the case of a superposition of different mass eigenstates , which may have different velocities .",
    "thus the choice of the boost is ambiguous because it is not clear whether a common boost should be used for the different mass eigenstates , or whether each mass eigenstate is boosted by a different velocity .",
    "this difficulty is another indication of the problems arising in the correspondence between a flavor state and a particle .",
    "it will be seen in section [ timespaceconversion ] that the choice of the boost has a big impact on the value of the oscillation length .    with the help of the orthogonality property ( [ orthogsaveur ] ) ,",
    "the amplitude ( [ ampliqm ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath48    in the case of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , the oscillation formula ( [ oscmq ] ) is sometimes written in the following way @xcite : @xmath49 the equivalence of this expression with eq .",
    "( [ oscmq ] ) can be checked with the scalar products ( [ orthogmasse ] ) .    another way to obtain the transition amplitude",
    "( [ oscmq ] ) for neutral mesons is to define a _",
    "reciprocal basis _",
    "this method consists in defining two mass bases : the _ kets _ belong to the _ in _ basis and are the right - eigenvectors of the hamiltonian , whereas the _ bras _ belong to the _ out _ basis ( or reciprocal basis ) and are the left - eigenvectors of the hamiltonian .",
    "their hermitian conjugate vectors are not used to write amplitudes .",
    "the hamiltonian can then be expressed in a diagonal form : @xmath50 where the @xmath51 are the complex eigenvalues of the hamiltonian in the rest frame of the oscillating particle ( in the mass - degenerate limit ) .",
    "the new bases are related to the flavor basis by @xmath52 with these notations , a kind of orthogonality property is restored : @xmath53 the oscillation formula obtained with these new bases is identical to eq .",

    "the physical interpretation of the reciprocal basis is not clear and its use is not really necessary , since the same result can be obtained without it . actually , the reciprocal basis method is a technical trick which is best understood from a field - theoretical viewpoint .",
    "after all , the new bases were first introduced @xcite in a quantum field theory approach as left- and right - eigenvectors of the propagator representing the oscillating particle . as emphasized by enz and lewis @xcite",

    "( [ hreciprocal ] ) , underlining their unphysical and intermediate character .",
    "for example , the quantity is not an observable , as mentioned in section [ mixing ] .    in the special case of a hermitian @xmath12 , @xmath20 is unitary and @xmath54 .",

    "( [ standardproba ] ) , into a measurable quantity .",
    "since the propagation time is not measured in oscillation experiments , a prescription is needed to get rid of the time dependence in the phase difference .",
    "the numerous prescriptions proposed in the literature are somewhat confusing .",
    "they can be classified by expanding the phase around an average energy or momentum .",
    "since the oscillating particle is on - shell , the energy @xmath42 can be expressed in function of the momentum @xmath64 .",
    "the phase @xmath65 can then be expanded around an average momentum @xmath66 , not very different from @xmath64 or @xmath67 , and an average mass @xmath68 .",
    "although the mass @xmath68 can be very different from @xmath44 or @xmath69 in the ultra - relativistic case , the expansion is correct as long as the mass difference @xmath70 is small with respect to the energy .",

    "equal time prescription _ has been explicitly stated @xcite , in reaction against articles proposing different detection times @xcite .",
    "it has also been legitimated by an _ equal velocity prescription _",
    "@xcite , which is seen to be equivalent to the previous prescription with the help of the classical relation @xmath79 .",
    "however the equal velocity condition leads to @xmath80 , which is very unlikely for neutrinos @xcite .",

    "the last relation implies that a boost of velocity @xmath84 is used to go from the rest frame of the mass eigenstate @xmath44 to the laboratory frame .",
    "thus the question of the choice of the correct boost boils down to the question of the equality of propagation times in the laboratory frame .",
    "a second prescription is needed in order to obtain the standard oscillation formula .",

    "it imposes that the term @xmath86 , appearing in eq .",
    "( [ expansionplanephase ] ) , is negligible in comparison with @xmath87 .",
    "this condition can be weakened to @xmath88 .",
    "since plane waves are delocalized in space - time , this condition can not be justified without a more sophisticated treatment , for example with wave packets .",

    "should first be averaged over the energy spectrum and over the region of production and detection ( see section [ incoherenteffects ] ) .",
    "if the oscillation is completely washed out by these averaging procedures , the transition probability ( [ standardproba ] ) can be simplified by the substitution @xmath95 .",
    "although the equal time prescription and the classical propagation condition are sufficient to obtain the standard oscillation phase ( [ standardphase ] ) , additional prescriptions leading to the same result are commonly found in the literature :    1 .",
    "the _ equal momentum prescription _ is the most common : @xmath96 . as seen above",
    ", this assumption is not necessary .",
    "moreover , it is impossible to impose experimental conditions such that the momentum uncertainty is zero , since the oscillations are destroyed by a momentum measurement more accurate than the mass difference .",
    "thus , this prescription is groundless . 2 .",
    "the _ equal energy prescription _ has been recently advocated by lipkin : @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "it has the advantage of avoiding the classical propagation condition since it leads to @xmath98 , so that the time dependence completely drops from the phase difference @xmath99 ( at least if the equal time prescription is assumed ) , and the standard oscillation phase ( [ standardphase ] ) is directly obtained .",
    "+ in principle , oscillation experiments are feasible with a zero energy uncertainty , since spatial oscillations are not expected to vanish in that case ( note that a quantum field treatment is necessary to prove it ) . in practice ,",
    "the energy uncertainty is far from being negligible and is often of the same order of magnitude as the momentum uncertainty .",
    "thus the equal energy prescription is only justified if an extremely small uncertainty on the energy is imposed by the physical properties of the process itself .",
    "do we have any theoretical reason to expect that this uncertainty is smaller than the mass difference ?",
    "no convincing arguments supporting that assumption have been given until now .",
    "for example .",
    "] , lipkin computes the energy - momentum uncertainties @xmath100 , @xmath101 of the kaon in the process @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "if the proton is at rest in a lattice , its momentum uncertainty , due to the debye temperature of the crystal , can be estimated at @xmath103ev .",
    "lipkin estimates @xmath100 to be of the same order of magnitude , whereas he neglects @xmath104 .",
    "however @xmath105 is still much larger than the mass difference @xmath106ev , which is the most important mass scale in the experiment .",
    "moreover the pion momentum uncertainty gives a first order contribution to @xmath101 and should not be neglected .",
    "even if one has shown that @xmath107 , there is a long way to go to show that @xmath108 . +",
    "another argument against the equality of energies is that it holds only in one particular frame . for example , if the energies of the different mass eigenstates are equal in the decay of a pion at rest ( ) , the energy difference becomes approximately equal to the momentum difference if the pion is relativistic @xcite .",
    "thus the equal energy prescription should be shown to be true in the laboratory frame for any experimental conditions .",
    "+ however there is a much more reasonable way of looking at the equal energy prescription .",
    "it consists in seeing it as the result of a time average washing out the interference between wave packet components having different energies .",
    "there is then no need to prove that the energy uncertainty is zero .",
    "this argument will be considered in section [ intermwavepackets ] .",
    "3 .   _ energy - momentum conservation at the production _ : first proposed by winter @xcite , this recurring prescription @xcite allows to compute explicitly @xmath73 .",
    "it has often been used to show that neither the momenta nor the energies of the different mass eigenstates are equal . in the example of the pion decay at rest ( ) ,",
    "the energies and momenta of the muon and neutrino can be computed exactly if the energy - momentum of the pion is perfectly known .",
    "however this knowledge is usually not available : when the energy - momentum spread of the source is much larger than the mass difference @xmath109 , it is meaningless to compute the exact values of the energies and momenta to order @xmath109 .",
    "a more detailed examination of this question requires wave packets instead of plane waves , or even better , quantum field theory .",
    "controversial prescriptions leading to nonstandard oscillations formulas involve _ different propagation times _ @xmath110 or , equivalently , different proper times @xmath111 .",
    "let us parametrize @xmath64 by @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a dimensionless number of order unity .",

    "( [ expansionplanephase ] ) and using @xmath118 , we obtain @xmath119 with the equal momentum prescription ( @xmath115 ) , the corresponding oscillation length will be smaller by a factor @xmath120 than the standard value given in eq .",

    "( [ longoscmq ] ) by a factor depending on the value of @xmath113 , which depends on the energy @xcite .",
    "these formulas can also be applied to the case of correlated oscillations , such as @xmath122 or @xmath123 . in the center - of - mass frame of the resonance , the different time prescription leads to an oscillation length smaller by a factor 2 than the standard value , since the equality @xmath124 valid in that frame leads to @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "another disturbing consequence of the different time prescription is the oscillation of recoil particles , for example @xmath125 in @xmath126 @xcite , or the muon in @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "this is easily seen by applying eq .",
    "( [ expansionplanephase ] ) to the recoil particle .",
    "although @xmath128 ( the recoil particle has only one mass eigenstate ) , @xmath129 because @xmath130 .",

    "this is not the case when there are several mass eigenstates , as the sum of the detection probabilities of the different mass eigenstates is always equal to 1 for a given propagation distance .",
    "the treatment of neutrino oscillations in @xmath131 proposed by field @xcite also resorts to the different time prescription .",
    "this author claims that the different neutrino mass eigenstates are detected at the same space - time point but are produced at different space - time points . following field",
    ", the oscillation phase would not only receive a contribution from the neutrino path difference but also from the path difference of the source which decays at different times .",
    "field computes the first contribution with the energy - momentum conservation prescription , which gives for a source at rest an oscillation phase larger than the standard result by a factor 2 ( see eq .  ( [ phaseepconserv ] ) with @xmath132 ) .",
    "the second contribution , which only appears in field s article , is computed in the same way .",
    "the oscillation phase obtained by field therefore differs from the standard result ( [ standardphase ] ) .",
    "field s method also leads to the prediction of muon oscillations because of the use of the different time prescription . ] .",
    "another example of the different time prescription can be found in malyshkin and kulsrud s analysis @xcite of the time variations of the solar neutrino flux , which leads to a result different from parke s formula @xcite .",
    "as we do not consider here oscillations in matter , this new oscillation formula will not be discussed further , although our comments on the different time prescription also apply to that case .",
    "the different time prescription has been strongly criticized by several authors within the plane wave framework @xcite .",
    "their argument , which can be stated as ` interference only occurs between states taken at the same space - time point ' , does not hold when examined in a wave packet or field - theoretical model .",
    "kiers , nussinov and weiss @xcite have indeed shown that the coherent character of the detection process allows wave functions at different space - time points to interfere .",
    "in particular , a long coherent measurement in time may be used to revive oscillations , even after the mass eigenstate wave packets have completely separated spatially ( see section [ intermwavepackets ] ) .",
    "the question of the correct time prescription is thus subtler than it seems at first sight .",
    "the crux of the matter is to take into account the production and detection processes . in this way , each increment in the phase associated to the propagating particle , due to a slightly different production ( respectively detection ) point , is cancelled by a decrement in the phase of the wave packet of the source ( respectively detector ) @xcite .",
    "for example , this cancellation can be implemented in the intermediate wave packet model ( see section [ intermwavepackets ] ) by computing the total amplitude as an overlap of the propagating wave packet with the source and detector wave packets @xcite .",
    "note however that this mechanism is much more natural in a quantum field model such as the external wave packet model ( see section  [ section3 ] ) , where the amplitude is integrated over all possible microscopic production and detection points , with the result that the phase depends only on average ( i.e.  macroscopic ) production and detection points .    in conclusion ,",
    "neither the equal time prescription nor the different time prescription can be justified in the plane wave approach , although the choice of the prescription has an important effect on value of the oscillation length .",
    "moreover other prescriptions , such as the classical propagation condition and the equal energy prescription , can not be understood within the plane waves formalism .",
    "a wave packet or quantum field treatment is thus inescapable .",
    "let us also insist on the dubiousness of the arguments using energy - momentum conservation . in most cases ,",
    "they are invalidated by the energy - momentum spectrum of the source : different energy - momentum components of the source can contribute to different mass eigenstates .      in section [ timespaceconversion ]",
    ", it has been shown that the plane wave treatment of particle oscillations can not deal in a satisfactory way with the time dependence of the oscillating phase .",
    "besides , this approach implies a perfectly well - known energy - momentum and an infinite uncertainty on the space - time localization of the oscillating particle .",
    "oscillations are destroyed under these assumptions @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "the perfect knowledge of the energy - momentum allows to determine which mass eigenstate propagates . on the other hand",
    ", the spatial delocalization makes impossible the measurement of the oscillation length .",
    "a correct oscillation formula should include observability conditions in such a way that the oscillation term vanishes if either    1 .",
    "the energy - momentum uncertainty is smaller than the mass difference between the interfering mass eigenstates , or 2 .",
    "the oscillation length is of the same order , or smaller , than the uncertainty on the position of the source or of the detection point of the oscillating particle .",
    "another kind of problem is not specific to the plane wave treatment , but affects all approaches where the oscillating particle is considered to be directly observable . on the one hand ,",
    "flavor eigenstates are ill - defined for stable particles , because we do not know how to define creator and annihilation operators of flavor states satisfying canonical ( anti)commutation relations @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "mass eigenstates are ill - defined for unstable particles , since they are in general not orthogonal ( except if the hamiltonian is normal , see section [ mixing ] ) .",
    "the solution to these problems simply consists in considering the oscillating particle as an intermediate state .",
    "actually this stand reflects well the experimental situation , where the oscillating particle is not directly observed .",
    "one rather detects the particles in interaction with the oscillating state , both at the source and at the detector .",
    "the flavor transition probability should thus be computed with observable particles as initial and final states @xcite .",
    "finally , we should mention two other problems regarding unstable particles .",
    "these difficulties arise because of the nonrelativistic wigner - weisskopf method used to compute the effective hamiltonian .",
    "first , interference between different mass eigenstates is forbidden in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics ( bargmann superselection rule @xcite ) .",
    "the argument is the following .",
    "the invariance of the schrdinger equation under galilean transformations determines the transformation law of a quantum state : it is multiplied by a phase factor depending on the mass and space - time position of the state .",
    "thus different mass eigenstates transform differently , so that the relative phase in a superposition of such eigenstates is not conserved under galilean transformations .",
    "therefore a coherent superposition of different mass eigenstates is forbidden .",
    "second , unstable particles can not be consistently described in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics for the same reason at the origin of the bargmann superselection rule : transitions between different mass eigenstates are forbidden @xcite .",
    "unstable states can not be considered as asymptotic states .",
    "thus they do not appear in the hilbert space of physical states and must be treated in quantum field theory where they appear as complex poles of the full propagator @xcite .",
    "some of the problems of the plane wave treatment are solved by the _ intermediate wave packet model _ , in which a wave packet is associated with each propagating mass eigenstate .",
    "note that this model is usually discussed with respect to neutrinos , i.e.  in the relativistic limit .",
    "nussinov was the first to put forward the existence of wave packets as the cause of a coherence length beyond which oscillations vanish @xcite .",
    "oscillations with wave packets were then studied in detail by kayser @xcite .",
    "the oscillation formula was later explicitly computed with gaussian wave packets by giunti , kim and lee @xcite .",
    "the intermediate wave packet model shows that oscillations vanish if @xmath133 , i.e.  if the uncertainty over the position is larger than the oscillation length ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "for minimal uncertainty wave packets , this condition can be rewritten as @xmath134 , i.e.  oscillations are forbidden if the momentum spread of the wave packets is smaller than the mass difference between the interfering eigenstates .",
    "thus oscillations are destroyed by energy - momentum measurements aiming to determine which mass eigenstate propagates .",
    "larger than the oscillation length.,width=188 ]    the other main result of the model is the existence of a coherence length beyond which oscillations vanish @xcite .",
    "its usual explanation is that wave packets associated to different mass eigenstates have different group velocities .",
    "hence , wave packets progressively separate , and interference disappears when they do not overlap anymore ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "we shall see in section [ subdecoh ] that dispersion is also at the origin of the coherence length .        in the intermediate wave packet model , the classical propagation condition , @xmath88 ,",
    "is automatically implemented by the space - time localization of the wave packet .",
    "however the question of the equal or different time prescription is not solved , since the times of production and detection are not specified by the formalism . as regards the question of the equality of energies or momenta , it is in principle no longer relevant , since the energy - momentum is spread out .",
    "in fact , the oscillation length depends only on the zeroth order values ( in a @xmath135-expansion ) of the average energies and momenta , because of the cancellation between the time and space parts of the phase ( see eqs .",
    "( [ expansionplanephase ] ) and ( [ expansionpjqm ] ) with @xmath64 equal to the average momentum ) . the time dependence of the probability is dealt with by averaging over time @xcite .",
    "it is thus not necessary to worry about the equality of energies or momenta .",
    "nevertheless there is still much argument about the equality of the energy spectra , or the equality of the average energies , momenta or velocities .",
    "for example , grossman and lipkin @xcite imposed a same energy spectrum for all mass eigenstates , so that the probability of finding a particle with the wrong flavor vanishes for all times at the position of the source .",
    "it can be objected that this boundary condition is automatically satisfied without imposing an identical energy spectrum , since the probability to detect the oscillating particle at the source becomes negligible once the wave packet has left it .",
    "equality of average velocities has been proposed by takeuchi , tazaki , tsai and yamazaki @xcite , but is very unlikely for neutrinos , as noted by okun and tsukerman @xcite , because the ratio of the average energies @xmath136 should then be equal to the mass ratio @xmath137 .",
    "actually there is another way of looking at this question . starting with arbitrary wave packets , it is simple to check that interference occurs only between wave packet components with the same energy , at least if the oscillation process is strictly stationary .",
    "this line of thought has been advocated by sudarsky _",
    "@xcite ( within a field - theoretical model ) , by lipkin @xcite ( with wave packets ) and by stodolsky @xcite ( within a density matrix formalism ) .",
    "let us explain it with the intermediate wave packet model . in one dimension ,",
    "the wave function corresponding to the mass eigenstate @xmath138 can be written as @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the coordinates of the source .",
    "the flavor - mixing transition probability is a linear superposition of terms @xmath142 .",
    "if the time of emission is unknown , the probability is averaged over @xmath143 , so that it becomes a superposition of terms like @xmath144 this equation makes clear that interference occurs only between wave packet components with the same energy .",
    "the time - averaged transition probability in the wave packet model is equivalent to an incoherent sum over energy eigenstates ( ` incoherent ' means a sum in the probability , not in the amplitude ) .",
    "( [ incohsum ] ) can thus be seen as a sum over plane waves of energy @xmath145 and momentum @xmath146 , weighed by the factor @xmath147 .",
    "the equivalence between a wave packet and a plane wave decomposition of a stationary beam was already observed by dicke and wittke @xcite in connection with electron - interference experiments , and by comsa @xcite in connection with neutron - interferometry .",
    "the same issue was recently raised by kiers , nussinov and weiss @xcite and by stodolsky @xcite , this time in connection with neutrinos .    of course the time integral in eq .",
    "( [ incohsum ] ) only yields a delta function if the time interval is infinite , i.e.  if the process is strictly stationary . in practice , there is always some available information on the time of emission . if the time integral is limited to the interval @xmath148 , the delta function becomes a narrow peak of width @xmath149 , which can be neglected as long as it is small in comparison with the mass difference @xmath150 .",
    "this condition can be written as @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the oscillation time .",
    "a few more results have been obtained with wave packets .",
    "kiers , nussinov and weiss have used the equivalence between wave packets and plane waves , explained above , to show that it is always possible to increase the coherence length by more accurate energy measurements at the detector @xcite .",
    "after giunti and kim @xcite showed how to take into account the detector s momentum uncertainty in the intermediate wave packet model , giunti @xcite did the same with the detector s energy uncertainty , so as to reproduce kiers , nussinov and weiss prediction .",
    "wave packets have also been applied by nauenberg to study correlated oscillations of neutrinos or mesons @xcite , and to the propagation of neutrinos in matter @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that the wave packet approach is explained in great detail in kim and pevsner s book @xcite , is discussed by fukugita and yanagida @xcite and has been reviewed by zralek @xcite .",
    "the intermediate wave packet model has been recently discussed by de leo , nishi and rotelli @xcite , who recover the standard oscillation formula under two conditions .",
    "the first condition , which they call ` minimal slippage ' , is equivalent to the existence of the coherence length discussed above , i.e.  mass eigenstate wave packets should overlap at detection otherwise there is decoherence .",
    "the second condition , which they call ` non instantaneous creation ' or ` pure flavor creation event - wise ' , means that interference occurs between wave packet components corresponding to different initial wave packet points , so that the standard oscillation phase ( [ standardphase ] ) is obtained .",
    "this mechanism , which was already explained by giunti and kim @xcite ( see end of section [ nonstandard ] ) , is automatically included in quantum field treatments where the oscillating particle is coupled to a source and detector ( see section  [ section3 ] ) . in the same article , de leo , nishi and rotelli argue that the oscillation formula might depend on the wave packet shape , for example if the wave packet is a superposition of two well - separated gaussian peaks , each having its own phase factor . in that case , there would be a succession of coherence / decoherence / coherence / decoherence regions as the mass eigenstates wave packets shift one with respect to the other .",
    "moreover , the constant phase difference between the two gaussian peaks crops up in the oscillation phase in the second coherence regime .",
    "while surprising phenomena indeed arise for such special wave packet shapes , it seems difficult to set up an experiment in which a specific wave packet shape is maintained for all the particles within the produced flux . in practice",
    "we should average over all wave packet shapes , with the result that only the typical width of the wave packet will have an effect on the final oscillation formula .",
    "all other effects due to the different shapes of the wave packets cancel each other out .",
    "besides , the analysis of oscillations in a faraway region ( such as the second coherence regime mentioned above ) should take into account the fact that dispersion wipes out oscillations at large distances ( see section [ subdecoh ] )",
    ".    the representation of the oscillating particle by a minimal uncertainty wave packet has been criticized by field @xcite , who claims that that oscillating particles follow classical space - time trajectories and that the oscillation phase is due to the propagation time difference between different mass eigenstates ( see section [ timespaceconversion ] ) .",
    "one of his main arguments is that the neutrino momentum spread in @xmath131 is of the order of decay width @xmath153 of the muon , so that neutrino oscillations should be completed suppressed by decoherence in wave packet models .",
    "moreover , the heisenberg relation is violated if one admits that the neutrino spatial uncertainty is of the order of the cm .",
    "these arguments do not hold since the neutrino momentum spread reflects the momentum uncertainties of the pion source and of the emitted muon , which are much larger than @xmath153 .",
    "finally , field criticizes models where the neutrino wave packet is coupled to a wave packet source , by claiming that the initial quantum state is not the same for all amplitudes , so that interference is forbidden .",
    "this criticism is not justified , since it makes no sense to cut the source wave packet into disjointed parts which are then interpreted as different initial states .",
    "although they solve some of the problems of the plane wave approach , intermediate wave packets are not satisfying for many reasons :    1 .",
    "the question of the existence of a fock space for the weak eigenstates remains .",
    "2 .   oscillating particles are not , and can not be , directly observed",
    ". it would be more convincing to write a transition probability between observable particles , involved in the production and detection of the oscillating particle .",
    "3 .   the wave packet shapes , sizes and normalizations are arbitrary . in particular , the amplitudes of production and detection are not taken into account .",
    "this is not a problem in the relativistic limit or for nearly degenerate masses , in which cases these amplitudes can be factorized from the sum over the mass eigenstates .",
    "however this factorization is not possible for nonrelativistic particles ( unless they are nearly degenerate in mass ) .",
    "4 .   the coherence length depends on the difference between the group velocities of the wave packets , the exact values of which are unknown in the nonrelativistic case ) can be interpreted as giving the group velocity of a mass eigenstate wave packet . in the relativistic limit ( @xmath154 ) ,",
    "the @xmath113-dependence drops from this equation , so that the velocity can be determined up to order @xmath155 without needing to know @xmath113 . ] .",
    "there is no reason to believe that the group velocities could be determined , to order @xmath155 , by energy - momentum conservation at the source , contrary to what is claimed in @xcite .",
    "the coherence length increases with the precision of the energy - momentum measurements at the source and at the detector . whereas the momentum precision is limited by the condition @xmath156",
    ", there is , a priori , no such limitation on the energy accuracy and , therefore , no bound on the coherence length .",
    "although it has been claimed @xcite that such a bound exists , the intermediate wave packet model can not settle that question , because the energy uncertainty has to be inserted by hand into the model .",
    "experiments measure a particle flux , not a particle density .",
    "the transition probability must thus be converted to a flux density , involving inverse velocity factors .",
    "these enhance nonrelativistic mass eigenstates and strongly skew the probability @xcite .",
    "this effect is due to the neglect of the amplitudes of production and detection and to an analysis restricted to one dimension .",
    "although it has not been controversial in the wave packet model , why should the times appearing in the different wave packets be identical ?",
    "a justification of this equal time prescription is necessary to rule out the nonstandard oscillation formulas discussed in section [ timespaceconversion ] .",
    "it is not possible to analyze in the wave packet model the corrections to the oscillation probability due to the possible instability of the propagating particle .",

    "this difficulty was already noted by giunti , kim and lee @xcite .    the review of intermediate wave packet models would not be complete without mentioning its latest and most sophisticated version , as proposed by giunti @xcite . instead of representing the oscillating particle by a superposition of arbitrary wave packets",

    "answers to questions  1 to 4 can be found in section [ answers ] while question  5 is treated in section  [ section9 ] .",
    "the numerous problems arising in the plane wave approach of oscillations ( see section [ planewaveproblems ] ) and in the intermediate wave packet method ( see section [ intermwavepackets ] ) show that the oscillating particle can not be treated in isolation .",
    "the oscillation process must be considered globally : the oscillating states become intermediate states , not directly observed , which propagate between a source and a detector .",
    "this idea is easily implemented in quantum field theory , where intermediate states are represented by internal lines of feynman diagrams .",
    "quantum field theory has the advantage of providing a relativistic treatment from the start , which is required to study the mixings of relativistic and nonrelativistic particles .",

    "although it is true that most sources are stationary from a macroscopic point of view ( for example , the flux of solar neutrinos is steady ) , there is no reason to think that it should be the case from a microscopic point of view .",
    "whereas it can be reasonable to make a stationary approximation in a quantum - mechanical model where we do not have any information on the microscopic processes ( for example a density matrix model as in @xcite ) , the same approximation is very dubious in quantum field theory , which describes the interactions of individual particles .",
    "after all , perturbative quantum field theory applies to one - particle propagation processes , in which a stationary source and detector are the exception , rather than the rule . as emphasized by cardall @xcite ,",
    "the sun is certainly not stationary at the atomic scale , and neither is a detector composed of bound state particles . for example , a water cerenkov detector sees charged lepton wave packets with finite energy and time spread",
    ". the finite character of the spread is partly due to the limited coherence time of the bound state particle that has interacted with the incoming neutrino .",
    "boundary conditions can be considered as stationary at the microscopic level when the energy uncertainty at the source or detector is smaller than the inverse propagation distance , i.e.  @xmath162 .",
    "this constraint is extremely stringent . in the example of atmospheric neutrinos",
    ", the process can be considered as stationary if @xmath163mev , which is not satisfied in current oscillation experiments .",
    "although it seems difficult to argue that the energy uncertainty is smaller than the mass difference , it is possible to take up another stand regarding stationary boundary conditions . in the same way as in section [ intermwavepackets ] , it consists in arguing that interference occurs between wave packet components with the same energy , because of the time average on the transition probability . as it is unrealistic to consider in isolation an interference for a given energy",
    ", we should take care to integrate the probability ( computed with stationary boundary conditions ) over the wave packet energy width . at that point",
    "a question arises : is this energy width determined by the source or by the detector ?",
    "there is thus information to be gained by working with non - stationary boundary conditions .",
    "moreover , we shall show that stationary boundary conditions can be imposed in the external wave packet model by assigning zero velocities to some states , whereas other states are represented by plane waves .    in section [ jacobsachsmodel ]",
    ", we describe the jacob - sachs model which is the prototype for the external wave packet model .",

    "remark that the phenomena of separation of wave packets and dispersion contribute to the coherence length in both regimes : if approximations such as @xmath841 ( or @xmath737 ) are not made , terms proportional to @xmath842 come from @xmath659 ( or @xmath843 ) and from the squared derivative of the phase , divided by the second derivative of @xmath844 ( or of @xmath845 ) .",

    "this question is inseparable from the first one . *",

    "if it were true , it would be impossible to increase without limit the coherence length by performing long coherent measurements .",
    "this would be in contradiction with stationary boundary condition models , which have a zero energy uncertainty but an infinite coherence length .",
    "however the product @xmath883 remains finite , as shown by eq .",
    "( [ statlimbis ] ) , so that the interference term does not vanish .",
    "for example , the grimus - stockinger model @xcite is obtained in the limit @xmath116 , @xmath882 with @xmath884 .",
    "the latter condition means that this model can be recovered from the external wave packet model if the stationary limit has the property @xmath885 ( see discussion after eq .",
    "( [ statlim ] ) ) .",
    "the only localization condition comes from the momentum spreads of the source and detector ( see eq .",
    "( [ local2 ] ) ) .",
    "note also that the amplitude @xmath261 ( see eq .",
    "( [ jacobsachsinteg ] ) ) takes in the stationary limit the form of a plane wave , with a well - defined energy and momentum ( see eqs .",
    "( [ expansionpj])-([expansionej ] ) with @xmath886 ) .",
    "the second important result is the equivalence ( [ incohsumqft ] ) between the time - integrated nonstationary probability and the energy - integrated stationary probability . since oscillations can be described in the former model by interfering ` wave packets ' , this interpretation is also valid in the latter , contrary to what was claimed in @xcite .",
    "thus the incoherent superposition of stationary amplitudes , which have a plane wave form , reproduces the characteristics of wave packet propagation . of course , this is not true if the probability is not integrated over the energy spectrum , but we have already argued that a source and a detector with zero energy uncertainties do not constitute realistic boundary conditions .",
    "as shown by kiers , nussinov and weiss @xcite , a more precise measurement of the energy at detection increases the coherence length .",

    "( [ cohlengthbis])-([sigmaeffbis ] ) ) . in the limit @xmath849 ,",

    "contrary to what was asserted in refs .",
    "@xcite , oscillations do not vanish in that limit since we argued above that @xmath883 remains finite .",
    "contrary to what was claimed by shtanov @xcite , mass prefactors never appear in front of the oscillating exponentials present in the transition probability ( [ proba ] ) .",
    "let us first explain what these ` mass prefactors ' mean .",
    "shtanov derives oscillation formulas for neutrinos within a source - propagator model in configuration space .",
    "shtanov computes the convolution of the neutrino propagator with a source , keeping only the phase in the oscillating exponentials but neglecting the contributions depending on the width @xmath438 of the source . with this last approximation ,",

    "let us consider his model will be considered in a scalar version for an easier comparison with our results .",
    "the propagator for a scalar particle propagating from @xmath174 to @xmath175 is asymptotically ( @xmath888 ) given in configuration space by @xmath889 where @xmath890 is the lorentz interval .",
    "the convolution of eq .",
    "( [ shtanovresult ] ) with a monochromatic source yields without problem the standard oscillation formula ( [ standardproba ] ) .",
    "however , convolution with a strongly localized source ( @xmath891 ) leads to an amplitude that keeps its dependence on the mass prefactor @xmath892 . in that case",
    ", the transition probability is not equivalent to the oscillation formula ( [ standardproba ] ) , unless the masses @xmath645 are nearly degenerate .",
    "we now proceed to show that mass prefactors only appear at an intermediate stage of the calculation , but not in the final result .",
    "note first that the amplitude ( [ shtanovresult ] ) is in correspondence with our amplitude ( [ longdisp ] ) , computed with the stationary phase method , since the prefactor in eq .  ( [ amplitudephasestat ] ) can be rewritten , for @xmath893 , as @xmath894 where the definition ( [ dispersiontime ] ) of the dispersion time has been used .",
    "this prefactor coincides with the prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ shtanovresult ] ) .",
    "however , the subsequent time average of the transition probability completely cancels this dependence on the mass , yielding eq .",

    "the width with respect to @xmath263 of the amplitude @xmath261 is found to be equal to @xmath895 ( where @xmath896 is the lorentz factor associated with the velocity @xmath551 ) , thereby providing a @xmath44-dependent factor that cancels the @xmath44 prefactor in the gaussian integration .",
    "shtanov does not obtain such a result , since he does not perform any time average on the probability . besides",
    ", mass prefactors would remain even if a time average were performed on the probability : no ` wave packet envelope ' appears indeed in shtanov s amplitude , so that the cancellation mechanism explained in the previous paragraph is not at work .",
    "for that reason , shtanov wrongly concludes that the mass prefactor remains if the source is strongly localized .",
    "another non - standard oscillation formula , derived by shtanov for mass eigenstates satisfying @xmath897 , reduces to the standard formula when decoherence mechanisms are taken into account . in conclusion , shtanov s computations in configuration space do not lead to new oscillation formulas .",
    "ioannisian and pilaftsis @xcite derive a formula for neutrino oscillations which exhibits a plane wave behavior if the condition @xmath493 is satisfied ( with @xmath898 , as usual ) . their term ` plane wave oscillations ' means that the oscillation amplitude @xmath261 does not decrease as the inverse of the distance , that its phase depends on the direction @xmath289 as @xmath899 , and that there is no geometrical constraint linking the average 3-momentum and the direction of observation . if it were true",

    "these conditions might be verified for atmospheric neutrinos .    in section [ sectionprobanodisp ] , we have proved that the detection probability of an oscillating particle , derived under the condition @xmath493 , is negligible in directions other than the average momentum whether the stationary limit is taken or not .",

    "furthermore , the external wave packet model has the advantage of associating a clear physical picture to the different stages of the calculations .",

    "for example , there are endless discussions about the energy and momentum coherence in the plane wave treatment of oscillations , since this approximation destroys all natural decoherence mechanisms .",
    "this should be contrasted with the fact that coherence - length and localization conditions appear explicitly in the oscillation formula ( [ proba ] ) obtained in the external wave packet model . moreover , decoherence between different energy components is automatic in the external wave packet model ( see section [ shortcut ] ) .",
    "note that one should be careful not to confuse the term ` ( in)coherent ' , referring here to a constraint applied to the amplitude or to the probability , with the term ` ( de)coherence ' , referring to the existence or disappearance of oscillations .",
    "first , the energy - momentum spread of the beam has to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "for example , the average of the oscillation term over a gaussian momentum distribution of width @xmath1149 and mean value @xmath1150 gives @xmath1151 where @xmath1152 .",
    "a new coherence length can be defined by @xmath1153 this new coherence length can be obtained from the coherence length ( [ cohlengthbis ] ) , derived in the external wave packet model , by substituting the beam spread @xmath1149 for the effective width @xmath534 .",
    "this result could be expected from the discussion of section [ shortcut ] , by extending the incoherent sum over the energy from a @xmath534 range to a @xmath1154 range .",
    "second , the macroscopic propagation distance @xmath259 is not perfectly known @xcite .",
    "a gaussian average over the macroscopic region of production gives @xmath1155 where @xmath1156 is the average propagation distance and @xmath1157 is the size of the source .",
    "thus a new localization condition has to be satisfied : @xmath1158 this condition is similar to the localization condition ( [ localconstraint ] ) which comes from a coherent effect .",
    "the only thing to do is to substitute the size of the source @xmath1159 for the effective width @xmath535 .",
    "as noted several times ( @xcite , and references therein ) , it is impossible , in stationary cases , to distinguish wave packets from an incoherent plane wave superposition with the same energy - momentum spectrum .",
    "this observation leads directly to the generalization of the quantum field computation of the transition probability already done with external gaussian wave packets .",
    "arbitrary wave packets , with space width and momentum widths not minimizing the uncertainty , lead to an oscillation probability similar to eq .",
    "( [ proba ] ) ( or eq .  ( [ probaunstable ] ) if the particle is unstable ) , except that the relation @xmath1160 does not hold anymore .",
    "this result can be understood as follows .",
    "if the arbitrary external wave packets are decomposed in gaussian wave packets , the amplitude @xmath647 becomes a superposition of gaussian amplitudes .",
    "these do not interfere with each other if their phases are very different .",
    "thus each gaussian amplitude will mostly interfere with itself , from which an incoherent superposition follows .    in practice ,",
    "the size of the region of production is usually much larger than the size of the wave packets .",
    "similarly , the energy - momentum spread of the beam is usually much larger than the energy - momentum spread of the wave packet .",
    "incoherent effects are thus very often dominant . at worst ,",
    "the sizes of the regions of production and detection and of the energy - momentum spectrum are determined by the characteristics of the wave packet .",
    "similar decoherence mechanisms were found by gabor @xcite in connection with electron - interference experiments .",
    "this author obtains three decoherence factors , coming from an average over the size of the source , from an average over the energy spectrum , and from the path difference between the interfering beams .",
    "the two first effects have been explained in this section , and the last effect can be related to the wave packet separation in particle oscillations .",
    "recall that coherent effects are constraints on the oscillation process , which should be applied at the level of the amplitude .",
    "most coherent effects can be expressed through their influence on the sizes of the external wave packets associated to the production and detection of the oscillating particle .",
    "unfortunately , the estimate of a wave packet size is not an easy matter and no consensus exists on whichever evaluation method is the best .",
    "let us consider first a solar neutrinos .",
    "only the cases of line spectra ( @xmath1161 or @xmath1162 ) deserve careful thought , since the energy average always dominates coherent effects for continuum spectra ( except if a detector with a extremely high energy resolution is invented ) .",
    "the most commonly discussed constraint on the wave packet size comes from the _ pressure broadening _ , that is , the interruption of coherent emission due to collisions of the emitting atoms .",
    "nussinov @xcite , loeb @xciteand kim and pevsner @xcite estimate the wave packet size of the parent nuclei at @xmath1163 cm , whereas krauss and wilczek @xcite propose @xmath1164 cm .",
    "kiers , nussinov and weiss @xcite claim that the small wave packets of captured electrons give a stronger constraint @xmath1165 cm .",
    "however , none of these estimates gives a momentum width @xmath436 as large as the @xmath563kev energy spread of the solar neutrino line spectra @xcite .",
    "the main contribution to this energy spread comes from the thermal energy spread of the captured electron @xcite , as well as from the doppler shift due to the thermal motion of the emitting nucleus @xcite .",
    "these effects can not be modelized at the level of the amplitude and belong thus to incoherent effects .",
    "finally , malyshkin and kulsrud @xcite compute the effect of coulomb collisions on the solar neutrino flux .",
    "they obtain a quantity @xmath1166 , equivalent to the wave packet width , and consistent with nussinov and loeb s estimates . while malyshkin and kulsrud agree that pressure broadening can be neglected with respect to the line width",
    ", they claim that it could be relevant to the decoherence in the case of the continuous solar spectra , for a detector of very high resolution and a very long oscillation length .",
    "this conclusion is in contradiction with the increase of the coherence length with the resolution of the detector : the coherence length is mainly determined by the energy resolution of the detector , if it is smaller than the wave packet size at the source .",
    "all these results show that coherent effects seem to be irrelevant to solar neutrinos .",
    "as regards neutrinos from supernovae , the source wave packet width has been estimated by anada and nishimura at @xmath1167 cm for neutrinos from the supernova core @xcite , and at @xmath1168 cm for neutrinos from the neutrino sphere @xcite . since @xmath1169mev , core neutrinos",
    "decohere before oscillating ( @xmath1170 ) , whereas sphere neutrinos might oscillate if the oscillation length is not too short ( @xmath1171 ) .",
    "however , the incoherent momentum spread ( @xmath1172 ) destroys any interference effect left , unless the oscillation length is , by chance , comparable to the supernova - earth distance @xcite .",
    "another type of neutrino source is a radioactive nucleus in an atomic lattice , which is the case for reactor neutrinos .",
    "the wave packet size can be estimated by rich @xcite and grimus and stockinger @xcite at @xmath1173 m .",
    "the wave packet size of the emitted electrons is larger and can be neglected @xcite . with the neutrino energy around @xmath563mev ,",
    "decoherence occurs beyond @xmath1174 oscillation lengths , so that there are no coherent effects relevant for laboratory experiments . of course",
    ", oscillations may vanish because of the incoherent energy average .",
    "coherent effects may also appear because of the finite lifetime of the source @xmath1175 , which interrupts the classical emission of the wave train and limits the size of the wave packet to @xmath1176 @xcite .",
    "this effect could be relevant to atmospheric neutrinos and in accelerators . for quasi - stable sources",
    ", the constraint @xmath1177 can be very stringent .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath131 , the length of the wave packet is bounded by @xmath1178 m and could be macroscopically large .",
    "however this argument is only valid as long as the decay point of the source is not observed at all . as emphasized by kayser @xcite , the detection of a final state , such as the muon in @xmath131 , can localize the decay point to a precision much better than either @xmath1179 or the macroscopic size of the production region .",
    "an extreme example is given by the neutrinos from the @xmath33 decay of a nucleus with @xmath1180sec .",
    "the observation of the @xmath33 particle allows to pin down the decay point to a precision much better than either @xmath1181 km or the production region , for example a nuclear reactor .",
    "thus the relation between the decay time of the source and the wave packet size of the oscillating particle is not direct .",
    "the decay time only puts an upper bound to the wave packet length .",
    "some papers dealing with the finite lifetime of the source are reviewed in section [ unstablesource ] .",
    "since the coherence length depends not only on the characteristics of the source , but also on those of the detector , the minimal wave packet size in the detection process must also be checked .",
    "it can be roughly estimated at @xmath1173 m , that is , @xmath1182mev @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "this momentum width is not larger than the energy spread and can be neglected .",
    "as regards k and b mesons , particle decay takes place before decoherence occurs : @xmath1183 where @xmath676 and @xmath1184 are given by eqs .",
    "( [ cohlengthbis ] ) and ( [ ldecay ] ) , respectively .    to sum up , coherent effects",
    "are most likely irrelevant with respect to incoherent effects .",
    "this discussion also shows that , in practice , we are far from being able to increase the coherence length by more accurate energy measurements .      in principle , the instability of the source can be taken into account in a field - theoretical model by considering the source as another internal line of the global feynman diagram describing the process .",
    "the difficulty , of technical nature , consists in integrating on both propagators , with a constraint on the decay point which can be either nonexistent , or very stringent .",
    "the case of an unstable source decaying in flight has been considered by campagne in a field - theoretical model @xcite . besides the usual condition @xmath1185",
    ", this author obtains a new localization condition @xmath1186 , where @xmath1187 is either the decay length @xmath1188 of the unstable source , or the length of the decay tunnel , if the latter is shorter .",
    "however , this treatment is not a real improvement on the one proposed by rich , who had derived earlier the same results in the framework of time perturbation theory in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "it is not satisfactory that macroscopic quantities , such as the lengths of the source , of the target and of the pion decay tunnel , are treated in @xcite on the same footing as microscopic quantities .",
    "the case of an unstable source at rest has been considered in detail by grimus , mohanty and stockinger @xcite .",
    "they use their previous field - theoretical model @xcite , modified by a quantum - mechanical wigner - weisskopf approximation , in order to take into account the finite lifetime of the source .",
    "besides the already known condition @xmath1185 , they obtain a new localization condition : @xmath1189 where @xmath1190 , @xmath1191 and @xmath1192 are respectively the wave packet momentum width , the mass , and the decay width of the unstable parent particle . in brief , the unstable source should not move on distances larger than the oscillation length during its lifetime , or else the oscillations vanish .",
    "they find that this condition is most likely satisfied in the experiments lsnd @xcite and karmen @xcite .",
    "the same authors have also found a new coherence length , @xmath1193 , which is however completely irrelevant , since it is much larger than the coherence lengths discussed previously ( @xmath1194 for all weakly unstable particles ) .",
    "the widths @xmath1195 can be estimated at @xmath1196mev for lsnd and karmen @xcite , so that the condition @xmath1185 is also satisfied .    a slightly different model for @xmath131",
    "is proposed by dolgov @xcite .",
    "this author computes the transition amplitude by coupling the neutrino propagator to external wave packets at the source , but not at the detector ( source - propagator model ) .",
    "the finite lifetime of the source is taken into account with a wigner - weisskopf approximation , like in the articles discussed above @xcite , but without the restriction of a source at rest .",
    "dolgov considers first the case where the decay point of the muon is not registered ( but its energy - momentum is perfectly known ) and computes an amplitude of spatial width @xmath1197 .",
    "the oscillating phase is given by @xmath1198 where @xmath1199 and @xmath423 are the velocities of the pion and neutrino , respectively .",
    "with the help of the constraint @xmath1200 , the second term of the phase is seen to be negligible if @xmath1201 . for a source at rest ,",
    "@xmath1202 and this localization condition vanishes .",
    "when the muon decay point is registered , dolgov obtains an oscillation phase equal to the standard result as long as the localization condition @xmath1203 is satisfied ( where @xmath1204 is the size of the wave packet of the initial pion )",
    ". it would be interesting to study intermediate situations where the muon is registered with a space - time uncertainty and to compute the time - independent oscillation probability .",
    "this brief account of the treatment of oscillations from an unstable source shows that there is still work to do , especially regarding decays in flight .",
    "experiments where two correlated mesons oscillate together are very interesting for the study of cp violation @xcite and can provide tests of the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) effect @xcite . at the present time , the process @xmath1205 is studied by the experiment da@xmath4ne at frascati @xcite .",
    "the process @xmath1206 is studied at @xmath1 factories such as kekb at tsukuba @xcite or babar at stanford @xcite , where asymmetric collisions allow the measurement of the @xmath1 pathlengths . in principle , correlated oscillations could occur with particles not conjugated to each other , for example the lepton could oscillate between @xmath1207 and @xmath1208 and the neutrino between @xmath242 and @xmath243 in the process @xmath1209 . however , the charged lepton masses are too different for such oscillations to be observable ( but note that if the masses were close enough to allow oscillations , it would be impossible to identify the flavor ) .    in this section ,",
    "we develop the formalism appropriate for correlated oscillations and we apply it to oscillations of correlated mesons .",
    "we then disprove a claim of a non - standard oscillation length .",
    "the question of the oscillation of recoil particles , like @xmath125 in @xmath1210 or @xmath1208 in @xmath127 , can be examined in the same framework , allowing us to answer the fifth question posed in section [ fivequestions ] .",
    "the treatment of one - particle oscillations with the external wave packet model of section  [ section3 ] can be easily extended by associating a propagator with each oscillating particle .",
    "consider the two successive processes : @xmath1211 where @xmath1212 and @xmath1213 are the average momenta of the source @xmath1214 and of the final states , respectively .",
    "we would like to apply the external wave packet model to the second process . in principle",
    "this model should be modified to include the decay width of the source @xmath1214 , since one external particle at an interaction point is not sufficient to localize it .",
    "however the decay widths of the @xmath1215 and @xmath1216 are large , so that their decay point will be close to their production point .",
    "the latter can be localized with the @xmath1217 external wave packets . in the case of a small decay width",
    ", it will be seen below that the correlated oscillations become independent of the production point .",
    "note that the initial flavors of the oscillating particles can not be observed at the source and must be summed over .",
    "for example , @xmath918 and @xmath1218 are both produced in the @xmath1216 decay . in contradistinction to the one - particle oscillation case , this sum does not destroy the oscillations , because of the flavor correlation between the oscillating particles .",
    "indeed , two mesons of the same flavor can not be observed in the above process at the same time in the center of mass frame ( epr effect ) .",
    "let us first write the amplitude corresponding to the process ( [ process ] ) .",
    "the masses of the first particle are noted @xmath1219 , @xmath1220 etc . , while the masses of the second particle are noted @xmath1221 , @xmath1222 etc .",
    "the two sets coincide if @xmath1223 and @xmath1224 are conjugated mesons , but it is not necessarily the case .",
    "the average production and detection points are noted @xmath231 and @xmath1225 , @xmath1226 , respectively . the partial amplitude , corresponding to the propagation of the eigenstates of mass @xmath1219 , from @xmath231 to @xmath1225 , and of mass @xmath1221 , from @xmath231 to @xmath1226 , can be written as @xmath1227 with the overlap function given by @xmath1228 the production overlap function @xmath1229 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ overlapp ] ) . the detection overlap function @xmath1230 is defined by the same equation , where @xmath1231 , @xmath1232 and @xmath1233 have been substituted to @xmath1234 , @xmath1235 and @xmath349 , respectively .",
    "the definition of @xmath1236 is similar .    the integration on the energies @xmath1237 can be done with the help of the jacob - sachs theorem ( [ integit ] ) , yielding @xmath1238 where @xmath1239 , @xmath1240 are the average propagation time and distance of @xmath1241 , and @xmath1242 is the pole of the propagator @xmath1243 .",
    "since our aim is not to prove the conservation of energy - momentum between the initial state @xmath1215 and the final states @xmath1244 , we set @xmath1245 as before , it will be useful to define reference masses @xmath1246 and @xmath1247 through @xmath1248 .",
    "the velocities @xmath1249 are defined by @xmath1250 ( they should not be confused with @xmath1251 , which appear in the overlap function and refer to the velocities of the detection regions , as explained in section [ gaussianoverlap ] )",
    ".      the momentum integrations in the amplitude ( [ doubleampli ] ) can be easily evaluated , either with laplace s method or with the stationary phase method , provided that the energy - momentum correlation is not too stringent at the source .",
    "more precisely , the integrations on @xmath1252 and @xmath1253 can be done independently if the energy uncertainty at the source is larger than the energy uncertainties at the detection points ( recall that the momentum width is always larger than the energy width ) .",
    "for example , the production widths for the @xmath1215 decay and the @xmath1216 decay can be estimated by their average decay widths , which are @xmath1254mev and @xmath1255mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "both widths are larger than typical detector uncertainties . in that case , the energy - momentum width at the source can be neglected and the overlap function factorizes in one - particle overlap functions : @xmath1256 thus the resulting amplitude factorizes in one - particle oscillation amplitudes .",
    "the rest of the computation proceeds as in the one - particle case , except when the detection times are measured : the time average is then done only once , on the production time .",
    "if the energy - momentum uncertainty is smaller at the production point than at the detection points , energy - momentum correlations are introduced at the source so that the amplitude can not be factorized .",
    "however , the oscillation formula is not expected to be modified , as long as the energy - momentum uncertainty at the source is larger than the mass difference between the interfering mass eigenstates : @xmath1257 .",
    "this condition resembles the localization condition derived in the one - particle oscillation case , which stated that oscillations vanish if the uncertainty on the position of the source is larger than the oscillation length .",
    "this similarity is misleading : it will be seen correlated oscillations do not vanish if @xmath1258 , since the knowledge of the source energy - momentum is not sufficient to ascertain which mass eigenstates are produced .",
    "this is because the energy - momentum of the source is shared between two intermediate particles , instead of one as in the one - particle oscillation model presented in section  [ section3 ] .",
    "moreover , the position and time of the production process can be reconstructed , in principle , from the final states characteristics , so that the oscillation pattern is not washed out by an ill - defined production point .",
    "the discussion of the above constraint is somewhat academic , as it is satisfied for the experimentally studied processes , @xmath1259 and @xmath1206 .",
    "nevertheless , the question of whether the violation of this constraint changes the oscillation formula will be examined , partly as a matter of principle , and partly because it will be useful for the discussion of the recoil oscillation conundrum .",
    "there are two reasons to study more carefully energy - momentum correlations at the source .",
    "first , this analysis yields a correlated localization condition , arising from the source .",
    "in particular , it allows to check explicitly that a zero momentum width at the source does not wash out the oscillations .",
    "second , it will be useful for the examination of the so - called recoil oscillations .",
    "unfortunately the treatment of the full 3-dimensional case is involved , because the correlation at the source might link a variation in the longitudinal momentum of one particle , with a variation in the transversal momentum of the other .",
    "if the transversal dispersion is neglected , the integrals can in principle be evaluated with laplace s method in three dimensions , but the results are lengthy .",
    "for that reason , only the collinear case will be presented .",
    "momenta , velocities and lengths can take positive or negative values , with the sign indicating the direction .",
    "since the stationary phase and laplace s method give the same results ( see section  [ section5 ] ) , we choose the latter for the longitudinal momenta integrations . besides , the dispersion will be neglected .",
    "recall that the masses of the first particle are noted @xmath1219 , @xmath1220 etc .",
    ", while the masses of the second particle are noted @xmath1221 , @xmath1222 etc .",
    "suppose that the overlap function @xmath760 is maximal for @xmath1260 and @xmath1261 .",
    "as before , these momenta can be computed by expanding the argument of the overlap function in small mass differences .",

    "if the overlap function is noted @xmath1272 , the expansion of the argument of the exponential around its extremum can be written as @xmath1273    the evaluation in one dimension of the integral ( [ doubleampli ] ) by laplace s method yields @xmath1274 where @xmath1275 , with @xmath1276 .",
    "the velocity @xmath1277 and the energy @xmath1278 are similarly defined .",

    "for example , @xmath1282 where @xmath1283 .",
    "the phase difference between two amplitudes vanishes but for the oscillation term already encountered in the previous sections , provided the wave packet is sufficiently localized , so that the term proportional to @xmath1284 in ( [ doublephase ] ) is negligible .    at the extremum ,",

    "what happens when the energy - momentum uncertainty at the source goes to zero ?",
    "three features of the amplitude ( [ doublelaplace ] ) must be examined : the localization condition ( [ doublelocal ] ) given by the function @xmath1289 , the value of the phase and the ` wave packet ' effect on the time average . in the limit @xmath1290 ( so that @xmath1291 too ) , the argument of the overlap function becomes at the extremum @xmath1292 thus a small , or even zero energy - momentum uncertainty at the source , does not destroy the oscillations .",
    "this result confirms our expectations , since a zero width at the source does not give information on which mass eigenstates propagate . on the other hand ,",
    "the function @xmath1289 diverges when either @xmath1293 or @xmath1294 goes to zero , yielding the expected localization conditions at the detectors .    in the limit of a zero energy - momentum width at the source ,",
    "wave packets associated to oscillating particles are of infinite extent .",
    "this phenomenon was expected , since the time of production @xmath1295 , included in @xmath1296 and @xmath1297 , becomes ill - defined .",
    "however the average on the time of production does not destroy the oscillations , at least if the detection times are measured .",
    "the explanation follows . in the limit @xmath1290 , eqs .",
    "( [ extremum1 ] ) and ( [ extremum2 ] ) show that the quantities @xmath1298 and @xmath1299 become @xmath1300 note that these values can be directly obtained , in the one - dimensional case , from energy - momentum conservation at the source . the phase of the amplitude ( see eq .",
    "( [ doublephase ] ) ) can then be written as @xmath1301 where the term of order zero in the mass differences has been dropped . since @xmath1302 and @xmath1303 , the phase is independent of the production point .",
    "however the production point is implicit in the phase ( [ limdoublephase ] ) when the classical limit is taken .",
    "the substitution of the classical relations @xmath1304 shows indeed that the expressions multiplying @xmath1305 and @xmath1306 are the propagation times @xmath1296 and @xmath1297 , respectively .",
    "in other words the space - time coordinates of the production point can be reconstructed from the coordinates of detection and the velocities of the oscillating particles , with the exception of the @xmath1307 case ( recall that velocities of the same sign have the same direction ) .",
    "while complete computations in three dimensions are complicated , it can be seen that the phase difference becomes independent of the production coordinates , in the limit of zero energy - momentum uncertainty at production : @xmath1308      it has been claimed that particles produced together with mixed states also oscillate because of the energy - momentum recoil .",
    "for example , the @xmath125 baryon , in the process @xmath1309 , is supposed to be in a superposition of two energy - momentum eigenstates , so that its detection probability should oscillate in space @xcite .",
    "furthermore the oscillation frequency of the kaon is modified by the momentum recoil against the @xmath125 . in another example , muons produced in @xmath127 are supposed to oscillate in space , because of the momentum recoil against the mixed state of the neutrino @xcite . as explained in section [ timespaceconversion ] , recoil oscillations arise in quantum - mechanical models if different propagation times are associated to the different mass eigenstates .",
    "recoil oscillations are unacceptable from basic principles , since the oscillation of the detection probability of a non - mixed state means that probability is not conserved at all distances . on the contrary ,",
    "when several mass eigenstates are mixed , the sum of the detection probabilities of the different mass eigenstates is always equal to 1 for a given propagation distance .",
    "this assertion has been questioned in several papers in the framework of quantum mechanics .",
    "these refutations involve either the consideration of the different proper times associated with the oscillating particle and the recoil particle @xcite , or the use of classical trajectories @xcite , or the use of energy - momentum conservation for the average energy - momenta of the propagating wave packets @xcite .",
    "the source - propagator approach of shtanov @xcite is not a real improvement on the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite , since shtanov treats configuration space variables , which have a microscopic role , as classical macroscopic variables .",
    "quantum field theory allows to understand which quantum - mechanical explanations are correct _ and _ important .",
    "the correlated oscillation model of the previous section is easily adapted to the treatment of recoil oscillations .",
    "suppose that the first particle is in a superposition of several mass eigenstates @xmath1219 , whereas the second particle has only one mass eigenstate @xmath1247 ( it is the so - called recoil particle ) .",
    "since the phase of the amplitude ( [ doublelaplace ] ) depends only on the average propagation times @xmath1310 and distances @xmath1311 , which are common to the different mass eigenstates , no recoil oscillations will be observed as long as these quantities are well - defined .",
    "this can be checked explicitly if @xmath1312 , as the overlap function factorizes in that case .",

    "this condition is not satisfied in the process @xmath126 .",
    "the momentum uncertainty of the proton , in this fixed - target experiment , is around 3 kev , i.e.  much larger than the kaon mass difference of @xmath1314kev @xcite .",
    "therefore the problem of recoil oscillations does not arise in the @xmath1315 complex .",
    "in contradistinction to the case of the @xmath1316 collision , it is possible to consider a @xmath1317 decay with a sharp momentum .",

    "if only the neutrino is observed , the detailed study of the one - particle oscillation case in section  [ section5 ] has shown that neutrino oscillations occur , provided that the momentum width associated with the muon is larger than the inverse oscillation length .",
    "on the other hand , if only the muon is observed , no oscillations in the probability of muon detection occur .",
    "the reason is that the sum over the neutrino flavors makes the transition probability ( [ proba ] ) independent of the distance ( apart from the geometrical decrease in @xmath766 ) : @xmath1320 furthermore oscillations also vanish after integration over the unknown source decay coordinates .",
    "this point was discussed in section [ unstablesource ] .",
    "finally , the only case left is the detection of both muon and neutrino , coming from the decay of a pion endowed with a sharp momentum .",
    "as explained above , this process can be treated like a correlated oscillation , but with only one mass eigenstate @xmath1247 for the muon .",
    "the formula ( [ limphaseproba ] ) shows that the oscillation of the probability is independent of the production point , so that the average over the production point does not have any effect on the phase .",
    "moreover the oscillation term can be expressed as depending only on the detection point of the neutrino , and on the reconstructed decay point ( see eq .",
    "( [ limdoublephase ] ) with @xmath1321 ) : @xmath1322 the substitution of the classical relations @xmath1304 in the above equation shows indeed that the phase difference depends only on the classical propagation time of the neutrino : @xmath1323 in short the probability to detect both muon and neutrino can be interpreted as the result of a neutrino oscillation alone . recall that the above relation can be obtained in a simple way in one dimension by energy - momentum conservation at the source .    as regards",
    "the experimental data , oscillations of recoil particles have not been probed ( in the case of the @xmath127 , it would only be possible for a neutrino oscillation length shorter than the muon decay length ) .",
    "however the neutral kaon mass difference obtained from strangeness oscillation experiments is consistent with the one obtained from regeneration experiments @xcite .",
    "we compute here the amplitude associated to the correlated oscillations of a pair of neutral mesons produced in @xmath1324 annihilation .",
    "the phenomenology of correlated @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons is discussed in @xcite and in @xcite , respectively .",
    "each meson oscillates between its components @xmath1325 , before decaying into final states @xmath1326 and @xmath1327 at spacetime points @xmath1328 and @xmath1329 : @xmath1330 where @xmath166 , @xmath1331 and @xmath1332 are the corresponding energy - momenta .    since each final state can be produced by either @xmath1333 or @xmath1334 , the two amplitudes arising from the exchange of @xmath1333 and @xmath1335 as intermediate states must be coherently added .",
    "the resonance quantum numbers of @xmath1336 and @xmath1337(4s ) , @xmath1338 , are conserved by the strong interactions at the source , so that the pair @xmath919 is in an antisymmetric state under @xmath340 and under @xmath1339 .",

    "we can only say that , in the end , the different mass eigenstates have the same _ average _ propagation time or distance , so that the oscillation formula will agree with the one obtained with the identical time prescription .",
    "as regards the experimental data , kayser @xcite has shown , in the case of the process @xmath1356 , that the mass difference obtained from the oscillation formula ( [ oscilkk ] ) is in agreement with the mass difference extracted from single @xmath1 oscillations .",
    "although the plane wave derivation of the vacuum oscillation formula has often been criticized in the literature , it is still used in most articles and textbooks .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , the oscillation formula obtained in this way is believed to be correct by most physicists , in spite of the numerous inconsistencies present in its derivation .",
    "second , the other approaches are not felt to be completely satisfying , with the consequence that more sophisticated treatments are not considered worth the effort .",
    "let us first point out that we do not claim that the oscillation formula obtained with the plane wave approach should be revised .",
    "however we have argued that this approach becomes unacceptable when all its inconsistencies are added up : the perfect knowledge of the momentum precludes spatial oscillations , observability conditions ( such as @xmath1357 or @xmath1358 ) are not taken into account , flavor states are ill - defined , unstable oscillating particles can not be consistently described in that model .",
    "furthermore , the plane wave derivation requires two prescriptions : the classical propagation condition ( @xmath88 ) and the equal time prescription ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "whereas the first prescription can be justified in a quantum - mechanical wave packet approach , the second prescription can only be proved right in a field - theoretical treatment .",
    "this is an important argument in favor of the latter approach , since the different time prescription ( @xmath1359 ) leads to oscillation formulas differing significantly from the standard result .",
    "we have also shown that an energy - momentum prescription ( such as @xmath1360 or @xmath1361 ) is not necessary to derive the oscillation formula .",
    "once the necessity of a more sophisticated approach is understood , we are faced with the choice between two main methods : on the one hand , a quantum - mechanical treatment associating wave packets with the propagating mass eigenstates and , on the other hand , a field - theoretical treatment where the oscillating particle is considered as an internal line of a feynman diagram .",
    "the first possibility is rich in physical insights ( such as the existence of a coherence length ) but not satisfactory in many respects : flavor states are still ill - defined , the equal time prescription is still needed , the nonrelativistic limit is problematic if the mass eigenstates are not nearly degenerate , the size of the wave packet is hard to estimate , the coherence length is not well - defined in the nonrelativistic limit , the case of a vanishing energy uncertainty is not included , and finally the treatment is inadequate for unstable particles .",
    "whereas most of these problems are solved in the interacting wave packet model of giunti @xcite , this last model requires quantum field theory to compute the interactions and is as complex as the external wave packet model .",
    "derivations of the oscillation formula resorting to field - theoretical methods are not very popular , although they seem the only way out .",
    "the first reason is that they are thought to be very complicated .",
    "the second reason is that the existing quantum field computations of the oscillation formula do not agree in all respects .",
    "the aim of our report was to counter both objections .",
    "the first of these is easily refuted by noting that the oscillation formula for a stable particle can be derived in a very simple field - theoretical model , the kobzarev _",
    "_ model @xcite , in which the source and the detector are approximated by infinitely heavy nuclei .",
    "this is the simplest model of all in which the oscillation formula can be consistently derived .",
    "the second objection could only be countered by a detailed and complete computation of the oscillation formula with all approximations carefully considered .    in this report , we have shown that all existing field - theoretical treatments ( with the noteworthy exception of the blasone - vitiello approach @xcite ) can be included in the so - called external wave packet model , where the oscillating particle is described as an internal line of a feynman diagram and propagates between a source and a detector localized with in- and outgoing wave packets . in particular , we have paid attention to the case of a vanishing energy uncertainty ( stationary limit ) and its wave packet interpretation , so that we could prove that the grimus - stockinger model @xcite is a subcase of the external wave packet model .",
    "two other limits have been considered .",
    "first , we have proved that oscillations near the source can be described by the standard oscillation formula , contrary to what was claimed by ioannisian and pilaftsis @xcite .",
    "second , we have also shown that oscillations far from a well - localized source are also described by the standard oscillation formula , contrary to shtanov s claim @xcite . in order to include all these cases in our formalism , it has been necessary to evaluate the amplitude with two approximation schemes : laplace s and stationary phase methods . as a result",
    ", the propagation range was divided into three regimes , distinguished by the dispersion ( or spreading in space - time ) of the amplitude . in the first regime , near the source ,",
    "the dispersion is negligible and laplace s method is sufficient .",
    "this case corresponds to ioannisian and pilaftsis limit . in the second regime ,",
    "the transversal dispersion becomes important , so that both approximation methods need to be used . in the third regime ,",
    "far from the source , the longitudinal dispersion becomes important and the stationary phase method is sufficient .",
    "this case corresponds to shtanov s limit .",
    "we have also discussed another method of computation ( in energy - momentum space ) valid for stable oscillating particles , as it clears up in which sense interference occurs between same energy states .",
    "the computation of the intrinsic decoherence at the wave packet level has yielded two well - known observability conditions for oscillations .",
    "however , our physical explanation differs from the standard one by taking into account the dispersion of the amplitude , so that the origin of decoherence depends on the distance at which it occurs .",
    "the first condition of observability of oscillations , @xmath1362 , is either due to the initial spread of the associated ` wave packets ' , or to their constant overlap at large distance .",
    "similarly the existence of a coherence length ( yielding the second observability condition @xmath810 ) is either due to the separation of ` wave packets ' , or to their dispersion .",
    "our 3-dimensional treatment has also yielded a third observability condition , @xmath1363 ( modified into @xmath1364 at short distance ) which has the obvious geometrical interpretation of constraining the propagation within a cone ( respectively a cylinder at short distance ) .",
    "it is now clear that the coherence length tends to infinity in the stationary limit , as noted by kiers , nussinov and weiss @xcite .",
    "the oscillation of unstable particles , whether mesons or neutrinos , has been analyzed in the same framework , with the result that the oscillation formula is only modified , as expected , by the well - known exponential decay term .",
    "nonexponential corrections to the oscillation formula have been estimated for the first time in quantum field theory .",
    "finally we have given a field - theoretical treatment of correlated oscillations , with the aim of disproving the existence of recoil oscillations .",
    "our work confirms that the standard vacuum oscillation formula given by eqs .",
    "( [ standardproba ] ) and ( [ standardphase ] ) is correct if the observability conditions mentioned above are satisfied .",
    "this fact is rather remarkable , in the light of the numerous inconsistencies which were present in the plane wave derivation of this formula .",
    "it can be explained by the following observations :    * the energy and momentum present in the phase are linked by the on - shell condition , and the average propagation time and length are linked by a constraint equivalent to a wave packet localization in space - time . for these reasons , the @xmath1365 and @xmath1366 components of the phase cancel but for the usual oscillating factor @xmath1367 ; * only same energy components interfere because of the time average , so that the time - averaged transition probability computed in the external wave packet model is equivalent to the energy - integrated transition probability computed with plane waves ; * from the previous argument , decoherence effects arising from external wave packets can not be distinguished from decoherence effects arising from averages over the production ( and detection ) region and over the energy spectrum ; since the former effects are dominated by the latter , they have no influence on the oscillation formula .    for ten years",
    ", new experimental results in neutrino physics have stimulated the research on the theory of particle oscillations , leading to the development of numerous ( and sometimes conflicting ) field - theoretical approaches . in this report , we have tried to unify these treatments and to extend them to oscillations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "we indeed believe that the neutrino oscillation formula is much strengthened by considering it in the same framework as the mesonic oscillation formula , whose parameters have been confirmed by other methods such as regeneration in matter .",
    "we hope to have convinced the reader that field - theoretical models provide , on the one hand , the most secure foundation to the oscillation formula and give , on the other hand , a good physical understanding of oscillation phenomena , whatever the particles involved .",
    "one case needing further investigation is the decay in flight of the source of the oscillating particle , which is important for atmospheric neutrinos and some laboratory neutrino experiments",
    ". it would also be interesting to apply a field - theoretical treatment to cascade decays , such as @xmath1368 , where double - flavor oscillations occur .",
    "these processes are useful for the determination of the signs of the @xmath1369 mass and lifetime differences @xcite .",
    "the field - theoretical approach faces its biggest challenge in the description of neutrino oscillations in matter .",
    "a first task consists in the rederivation of the msw oscillation formula ( see @xcite for a few attempts ) .",
    "another difficult task is to describe the nonstationary evolution of neutrinos in supernovae or in the early universe , where interaction rates are in competition with the flavor oscillation period @xcite .",
    "the turn of the century marks a new golden age for cp violation experiments , thanks to the @xmath1 factories , as well as the golden era of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "these favorable auspices should be a great stimulation for further research on the theoretical foundations of oscillations .",

    "<S> this report deals with the quantum field theory of particle oscillations in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> we first review the various controversies regarding quantum - mechanical derivations of the oscillation formula , as well as the different field - theoretical approaches proposed to settle them . </S>",
    "<S> we then clear up the contradictions between the existing field - theoretical treatments by a thorough study of the external wave packet model . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that the latter includes stationary models as a subcase . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we compute explicitly decoherence terms , which destroy interferences , in order to prove that the coherence length can be increased without bound by more accurate energy measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we show that decoherence originates not only in the width and in the separation of wave packets , but also in their spreading through space - time . in this review , we neither assume the relativistic limit nor the stability of oscillating particles , so that the oscillation formula derived with field - theoretical methods can be applied not only to neutrinos but also to neutral @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons . finally , we discuss oscillations of correlated particles in the same framework </S>",
