    "this suggests an intriguing possibility involving irregular potentials : what happens to the wigner measures in a system where the potential allows a complete quantum treatment , but causes the classical flow to be ill defined ?",

    "@xmath91 , even in dimension @xmath57 there is no unique extension for the flow all over the phase space .",
    "as we can see in figure [ fig : flow_classical](b ) , when coming from the right - hand side below , there are different alternative trajectories after reaching @xmath77 with zero momentum : going back to the right upwards , crossing to the left downwards , staying at @xmath92 , or staying there for a moment and then resume moving to one or to the other side .",
    "let us treat this problem in three different steps .      in @xcite",
    ", the authors proved that the hamiltonian flow can always be continuously extended in a unique manner to @xmath93 and that , whenever the wigner measure does not charge the singulities in the phase space , _ i.e. _ , while @xmath94 , then @xmath24 follows these unique continuous extensions .",
    "this result is grounded on the facts that @xmath88 does not charge the set @xmath93 for more than a negligible time , more precisely that @xmath95 almost everywhere in @xmath96 with respect to @xmath31 ( for a matter of completeness , we re - obtain this result in lemma [ lem : m_is_zero_and_etc ] ) , and that the measures obey to the standard liouville equation with @xmath1 away from @xmath69 , where the potential is regular .",
    "in this paper we will obtain in section [ sec : establishing_liouville ] a complete description of the dynamics to which the semiclassical measures ought to obey , including near and inside the singularities , by driving an approach similar to that of @xcite , which makes an extensive use of _ symbolic calculus _ ( section [ sec : symbolic_calculus ] ) and _ two - microlocal measures _ ( section [ sec : two_microlocal_analysis ] ) :    [ th : main_result_1 ] let @xmath56 be the solution to the system with a conical potential of the form , and denote @xmath97 .",
    "then the correspondent wigner measures @xmath24 obey to the @xmath98 equation : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the indicatrix of @xmath101 ( and @xmath102 of it complementar inside @xmath103 ) and for each @xmath104 , @xmath105 is the orthogonal projector over @xmath106 inside @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , decomposing @xmath103 in a neighbourhood of @xmath69 as the bundle @xmath107 with fibers @xmath108 ( and elements @xmath109 ) , there exists a measure @xmath110 over @xmath111 , where @xmath112 , satisfying the asymmetry condition @xmath113 and such that @xmath114    [ rem : remark_in_proof ] observe that equation is the sum of two liouville terms , one for the potential @xmath1 outside @xmath68 and another for @xmath115 over it .",
    "usual transport under @xmath1 is assured away from @xmath68 by @xcite , thus , if no trajectories outside @xmath68 lead to or from it , these both terms are shown to cancel on their own against functions in @xmath116 and consider the local conservation of mass . ]",
    "and the equation decouples into two independent transport phenomena , one inside and the other outside @xmath68 , the regularity of the insider flow being guaranteed by the picard - lindelf theorem , as @xmath117 is smooth in the topological space @xmath68 .",
    "[ rem : static_equilibrium ] the second part of the theorem , the asymmetry formula , will be discussed ahead in section [ sec : second_question ] and turns out to indicate that any mass that stay on the singularity will be in static equilibrium over it .",
    "remark [ rem : remark_in_proof ] immediately gives :    [ th : main_result_2 ] in the same conditions of theorem [ th : main_result_1 ] , suppose that no hamiltonian trajectories lead into @xmath68 .",
    "call @xmath7 the hamiltonian flow defined by the trajectories induced by @xmath1 for @xmath118 and by @xmath119 for @xmath120 . then , writing @xmath121 , one has @xmath122 for all @xmath11 , where @xmath43 is the wigner measure of the family @xmath123 .",
    "more precisely , suppose that the hamiltonian flow @xmath7 can be extended in a unique way everywhere in a region @xmath124 .",
    "it is sufficient in theorem [ th : main_result_2 ] that we choose a time interval @xmath125 such that @xmath126 to assure the transport for any @xmath127 ; this recovers the result in @xcite for a particular choice where @xmath128 . in words , it is sufficient that our measure transported by the flow does not hit any point where the trajectories split , the fact that it may charge the singularities being irrelevant .",
    "now , what happens if some trajectories hit @xmath68 ?",
    "first , realize that in this case there is never uniqueness , since there are necessarily the outgoing trajectory ( which is the reverse of the incoming one ) and the one whose projection on @xmath75 evolves freely and , more importantly , whose projection on @xmath129 remains static , what is always kinectically admissible ( with @xmath130 , the velocity normal to @xmath69 is @xmath27 , for @xmath131 is actually @xmath132 , as informs theorem [ th : main_result_1 ] ) .",
    "the equation in theorem [ th : main_result_1 ] says that either a transfer of mass between these two regimes , the insider and the outsider , and the continuation of the exterior transport are possible to happen , but gives no more information .",
    "the second part of the theorem , however , may solve the question .",
    "it has got a rich geometric interpretation , saying that the mass distribution on @xmath68 has some asymmetry around @xmath69 due to the `` shape '' @xmath133 of the conical singularity , and that it is deformed by an exterior normal force @xmath134 , in such a manner that portion of mass that remains over the singularity wil be in static equilibrium .",
    "indeed , the measure @xmath110 gives the mass distribution in a sphere bundle with fibers @xmath135 around the singularity , _",
    "i.e. _ , the directions @xmath136 in the exterior space from where the solutions @xmath56 concentrate more or less intensively to the singular points .    if @xmath137 , then of course the measure does not stay at the singularity , so it necessarily continues under the exterior regime ( regardless of whether it is unambiguously defined or not ) and we got all the information @xmath110 may give ; let us then suppose @xmath138 .",
    "loosely , let us also consider @xmath110 as a function of @xmath139 ( as if it was absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath140 ) and let us say that @xmath141 gives the total mass @xmath142 on the point @xmath139 ( though it actually gives a mass density over the phase space ) at the instant @xmath6 , supposed not to be @xmath27 .",
    "naturally , @xmath143 gives the average vector of concentration to this point , whose normalization by @xmath142 we will call @xmath144 .",
    "realize that the speed the mass may have tangentially to the singular space @xmath69 , that we call @xmath145 , plays no role in dictating how the quantum concentration will happen thereon ; with simple hypotheses on the family @xmath123 ( like @xmath146-oscillation , see @xcite ) , one has @xmath147 , and the same for @xmath110 since @xmath148 , so we could be working directly with @xmath149 .",
    "well , the derivative of a potential is a force , so let us call @xmath150 the force normal to the singular manifold @xmath69 at the point @xmath151 .",
    "consequently , the asymmetry formula in theorem [ th : main_result_1 ] is imposing a simple condition on the mass concentration : @xmath152 which is to say that , in average , the mass should concentrate alongside the exterior normal force @xmath153 .",
    "how strong the concentration will be there with respect to the other points , or whether it is going to be attractive or repulsive , will depend on the shape of the conical singularity at the different points of @xmath69 , described ( so as to say ) by @xmath133 .",
    "an example is illustrated in figure [ fig : asymetry ] below .",
    "encircled by its normal bundle in sphere @xmath154 ( with fibres @xmath155 ) . the mass concentration given by @xmath110",
    "is represented by the more or less strongly shadowed regions , and is directed by the normal force @xmath153 which is spinning around @xmath69 in the example . here",
    ", we took @xmath156 and @xmath157.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the reason why we have said that equation is a condition of equilibrium is that the expression inside the integral therein is similar to what would be the total force normal to @xmath69 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath158 , when calculated on @xmath69 ( where @xmath159 ) and making sense of @xmath136 as some limit of @xmath160 ( a vector in @xmath161 ) when @xmath72 approaches the singularity from a particular direction .",
    "so we are also tempted to interpret as saying that the total force normal to @xmath69 on some mass staying on the singularity , to be given by the integral , is @xmath27 : this mass is in static equilibrium .    besides , in formula , we have @xmath162 , since @xmath144 is an average of norm @xmath57 vectors in @xmath161 .",
    "consequently , we must have @xmath163 not to be led to an absurd .",
    "if this is not the case , then we must have @xmath137 in order to satisfy the asymmetry condition trivially , which means that the wigner measure will not stay on the singularity .",
    "this reasoning will be made rigorous in section [ sec : asymmetry_condition_in_use ] , where we will prove :    [ th : main_result_4 ] if for some @xmath164 one has @xmath165 , then there exists a neighbourhood @xmath166 of @xmath151 such that @xmath137 over @xmath167 , where @xmath168 .",
    "once we know some cases where the mass is forbidden to stay over the singularity , it is worth studying deeperly the ways it can get in and out @xmath68 :    [ th : accessory_result_1 ] supposing @xmath169 , for any trajectory @xmath4 leading out from or into @xmath68 in @xmath164 at @xmath170 , set the @xmath171 vector @xmath172 ; then , for any sequence @xmath173 converging to @xmath170 , @xmath174 has points of adherence @xmath175 , which are non - zero roots of @xmath176 conversely , for any @xmath177 and @xmath178 satisfying , there exists a unique continuous extension of the classical flow which passes by @xmath151 at @xmath179 without staying on @xmath151 and whose correspondent limits @xmath180 exist and are equal to @xmath175 .",
    "if has no non - zero roots , then no trajectory leads in or out @xmath68 in @xmath151 .",
    "if @xmath181 , then @xmath182 may have @xmath27 as a point of adherence , but even in this case @xmath183 will have non - zero adherence points that we denote @xmath184 .",
    "we will abusively call @xmath185 `` zero roots '' of and say that trajectories reach @xmath68 in @xmath151 following directions @xmath175 if @xmath186 both exist and are equal to @xmath187 .",
    "sometimes it may be that an incoming trajectory only approaches this limit asymptotically at @xmath188 .",
    "[ th : accessory_result_2 ] if @xmath181 , then at least one of the following affirmations holds :    * equation has non - zero roots @xmath175 and there are unique trajectories leaving and arriving on @xmath68 in @xmath151 through the directions @xmath175 ; * equation has `` zero roots '' , in the sense that there are @xmath189 such that @xmath190 and either there is no trajectories reaching @xmath68 in @xmath151 through @xmath185 , or they exist but do not arrive onto @xmath68 within any finite time ; * the classical flow does not touch @xmath68 in @xmath151 .    in any case , if equation has no roots ( `` zero '' or non - zero ) , then no classical trajectory passes by @xmath68 in @xmath164 .    in @xcite , we will endeavour a more precise study of the link between @xmath110 and the classical flow , generalizating the link between theorem [ th : main_result_4 ] and theorems [ th : accessory_result_1 ] and [ th : accessory_result_2 ] .    in section",
    "[ sec : asymmetry_condition_in_use ] we will work out the proof of theorems [ th : main_result_4 ] , [ th : accessory_result_1 ] and [ th : accessory_result_2 ] in coordinates that are more suitable to understand @xmath191 as an approaching direction .",
    "besides , we will see in section [ sec : examples ] , by means of a number of examples , that these results allow a full classification of the types of trajectories that may reach or stay on the singularity . in some cases , like for @xmath192 or @xmath193 in @xmath2 , they allow a full resolution of the problem when the inequality in theorem [ th : main_result_4 ] holds , since by solving explicitly one can verify that there is only a unique trajectory leading in and out the singularity without staying thereon , and necessarily the measures will follow it and not charge @xmath68 .    in short , so far we have seen that whenever we have a well defined flow , we know what the semiclassical measures do : they are transported thereby . if the flow presents trajectory splits , they necessarily happen on @xmath68 , where there is always the possibility of regime change between outsider and insider flows .",
    "then , thanks to the measure @xmath110 , we may be able to obtain enough information to decide whether the measures stay or not on the singularity , and in case they stay , we know that they will be carried by the flow generated by @xmath115",
    ".      finally , a last problem is : if a measure does not stay on @xmath68 and continues in the exterior flow , but even though there are different trajectories to take , can we derive from the well posed quantum evolution some general criterion for choosing the actual trajectories that the measure will follow ? is there any selection principle for the classical movement of a particle under such conical potentials ?    as we will see in section [ sec : splitting ] , the answer is negative .",
    "the path a wigner measure ( or a particle ) takes after its trajectory splits depends crucially on its quantum state concentration , so any selection principle making appeal only to purely classical or semiclassical information is to be dismissed .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> in this article we study the propagation of wigner measures linked to solutions of the schrdinger equation with potentials presenting conical singularities and show that they are transported by two different hamiltonian flows , one over the bundle cotangent to the singular set and the other elsewhere in the phase space , up to a transference phenomenon between these two regimes that may arise whenever trajectories in the outsider flow lead in or out the bundle . </S>",
    "<S> we describe in detail either the flow and the mass concentration around and on the singular set and illustrate with examples some issues raised by the lack of unicity for the classical trajectories at the singularities despite the unicity for the quantum solutions , dismissing any classical selection principle , but in some cases being able to fully solve the propagation problem . + * keywords * : schrdinger equation , wigner measures , two - microlocal measures , symbolic calculus , quantum - classical correspondence , wave packet approximation . </S>"
