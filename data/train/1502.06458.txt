    "one of the biggest surprises that general relativity ( gr ) has given us is that under certain circumstances the theory predicts its own limitations .",
    "there are two physical situations where we expect general relativity to break down .",
    "the first is the gravitational collapse of certain massive stars when their nuclear fuel is spent .",
    "the second one is the distant past of the universe when the density and temperature were extreme . in both cases",
    "we expect that the geometry of spacetime will show some pathological behaviour .",
    "the first step towards a mathematical characterisation of the circumstances under which gr breaks down was achieved in the seminal work of penrose and hawking in their singularity theorems ( see @xcite , chapter 8) .",
    "the general structure of the theorems establish that if on a spacetime ( @xmath0 ) :    * a condition on the curvature * an appropriate initial or boundary condition * and a global causal condition    are satisfied then ( @xmath0 ) must be geodesically incomplete @xcite .    the characterisation of singularities in terms of geodesic incompleteness requires us to consider spacetimes with metrics of differentiability",
    "at least @xmath1 ( also denoted @xmath2 ) in order to have a well - defined notion of geodesics . for any metric with lower differentiability one does not have uniqueness of the geodesic equation so it is not clear how one can define a precise notion of singular behaviour using point particles as probes to test the geometry .",
    "this was the motivation for clarke to introduce the notion of a _",
    "@xmath3- globally hyperbolic _ spacetime @xcite which involves probing the geometry of spacetime with classical fields rather than point particles .",
    "earlier work by wald @xcite gave a prescription to define dynamics in static non - globally hyperbolic spacetimes .",
    "based on similar techniques , kay and studer @xcite determined the boundary conditions for quantum scalar fields on singular spacetimes with conical singularities representing cosmic strings .",
    "subsequently horowitz and marolf @xcite , used wald s approach to study the theory of quantum free particles in static spacetimes with timelike singularities .",
    "they used the term _ quantum regular _ if the evolution of any state is uniquely defined for all time .",
    "the main technique used for this was to notice that that if the the spatial laplace - beltrami operator is essentially self - adjoint in @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is a three dimensional geodesically incomplete manifold and @xmath6 the volume form of the induced metric on @xmath5 ) then using standard properties of self - adjoint operators , a unique evolution of the wave function is obtained .",
    "moreover , the classical singularities disappear in the sense that there is no freedom in the boundary conditions to define the state evolution",
    ". later work , by ishibashi and hasoya @xcite used similar techniques to investigate the evolution of the wave equation @xmath7 in static singular spacetimes by focusing on changing the function space from @xmath4 to @xmath8 .",
    "the main reason for this is that finiteness of the energy states implies the finiteness of the @xmath9 norm .",
    "in addition , exploring different hilbert spaces is important for quantum theory in curved spacetimes .",
    "differences in the corresponding quantum field theories might provide useful insight into understand the behaviour of quantum states near singularities in curved spacetimes .",
    "finally , ishibashi and hasoya used the term _ wave regular _ if the initial value of the wave equation has unique solutions in the whole spacetime with no arbitrariness in the choice of boundary conditions .",
    "vickers and wilson @xcite also studied the problem of conical singularities from clarke s perspective and wilson in @xcite showed that one could obtain dynamic evolution subject to constrains on the initial data and a flux condition in the singularity .    the link between the concept of @xmath3- globally hyperbolic , quantum regular and wave regular is to redefine a singularity in spacetime not as an obstruction to geodesics or curves but as an obstruction to the dynamics of test fields . nevertheless , each concept has it own characteristics .",
    "while quantum regularity probes spacetime with a quantum free particle , the notion of @xmath3- globally hyperbolic and wave regular uses the classical wave equation .",
    "also , while quantum regularity and wave regularity look to singularities in terms of boundary conditions , a @xmath3-globally hyperbolic approach identifies the singularity as an interior point in a spacetime with low differentiability . in an heuristic manner",
    ", one can refer to _ field singularities _ as any approach to identify and characterise gravitational singularities as an obstruction to the evolution of test fields .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard approach where one uses geodesic incompleteness ( which describes an obstruction to the evolution of a test particle ) to identify singularities    in this paper the particular case we will deal with is that of the wave equation and we define a point @xmath10 in @xmath11 to be _ strongly wave regular _ if there is a neighbourhood of @xmath10 in the spacetime @xmath12 such that there is a lens - shaped domain @xmath13 containing @xmath10 ( see figure 1 ) and there is a triple @xmath14 such that the initial value problem for the wave equation @xmath15 on @xmath16 is locally well posed in the following sense :    * there exists a solution in the function space @xmath17 . *",
    "the solution is unique in the function space @xmath18 . * the solutions in the space @xmath18 depends continuously with respect initial data in function space @xmath19 .",
    "a _ weakly wave regular _",
    "point @xmath10 only satisfies the first two conditions .",
    "a _ strongly wave regular spacetime _ is defined to be one such that every point @xmath10 in @xmath20 is strongly wave regular .    in this paper",
    "we refine and provide full details of clarke s arguments in @xcite where he outlined this issue for what he called curve integrable spacetimes and give a detailed description of the techniques needed to show that solutions to the wave equations exist and are unique . roughly speaking a curve",
    "integrable spacetime is one in which the integrals of both the connection and curvature along a curve are bounded ( see condition ( 4 ) of the main theorem for a precise description ) . from a physical point of view a spacetime is a curve integrable spacetime if there is a set @xmath21 that defines a range of timelike directions which are transverse to any shock or caustic that may be present .",
    "the theorem proved by clarke in @xcite required both the quadratic and linear part of the riemann tensor ( in terms of the christoffel symbols ) to be separately integrable along the timelike directions . however",
    "clarke also conjectured that one can prove existence and uniqueness of the wave equation if one only required the weaker condition of the integrability of the christoffel symbols and the riemann tensor . in the present paper",
    "we prove this conjecture .",
    "in addition , we also show continuity with respect initial data and establish strong wave regularity .",
    "in this section we establish the well - posedness of solutions to the initial value problem for @xmath15 where @xmath22 is the wave operator given by a metric @xmath23 that corresponds to a curve integrable spacetime .",
    "the proof is in four main steps .",
    "the first step is to define an energy inequality which is an inequality between an integral of the function and its derivatives at a future time bounded above by an integral of the function and its derivatives at the initial time and the source function .",
    "the second step is to show self - adjointness of the wave operator in some appropriate function space and to use the hahn - banach theorem to prove existence of a solution .",
    "the third step is to notice that the energy inequality allows us to show uniqueness of our solution .",
    "the last step is to conclude that the solution depends continuously on the initial data again using the energy inequality .",
    "following clarke @xcite , we introduce an enlarged notion of a solution for these spacetimes .",
    "the general geometric background we use to define a generalised solution is the existence of a _ lens - shaped _",
    "domain @xmath13 properly contained in a open subset @xmath24 of a @xmath25-dimensional spacetime @xmath26 .",
    "this means that there is a smooth map @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a compact , @xmath29 co - dimension 1 sub - manifold with boundary , with the property that :    * @xmath30 is the identity map . *",
    "@xmath31 for any @xmath32 , @xmath33 . * for any fixed @xmath34 , @xmath35 is an @xmath36- dimensional spacelike hypersurface . *",

    "the equivalence between a solution of einstein s field equations and the background metric on which the fields propagate makes the definition of a singularity in general relativity subtler than in any other physical theory .",
    "the most common definition of a singular - free spacetime was formulated by geroch @xcite ; a spacetime is singular - free if it is geodesically complete .",
    "this characterisation is well motivated as we can associate the history of free - falling test particles to geodesic motion .",
    "in fact , hawking and penrose @xcite showed under very general physical conditions on the topology of the manifold and the behaviour of the causal structure of the spacetime that during gravitational collapse the spacetime can not be geodesically complete .    however , there is a gap between physical intuition and mathematical formalism .",
    "we want to describe from a physical point of view a singularity as some region of spacetime that becomes more and more pathological ( maybe by the curvature becoming unbounded ) where eventually general relativity is no longer adequate and some quantum gravity theory is needed .",
    "the singularity theorems make a more modest conclusion simply that spacetime contains a geodesic that can not be continued indefinitely .",
    "the main objective of the present work is to show possible ways in which we can bridge the gap between intuitions and formalisms .    in order to pursue a more complete physical description of singularities we proposed to define the notion of a singularity as obstruction to fields rather that geodesic trajectories .",
    "then one can talk about the field regularity of spacetime .",
    "in particular , in this paper the concept of classical strongly wave regularity was explored on spacetimes with low differentiability with certain timelike vector field transverse to caustics or shocks where the curvature is not a continuous function .",
    "the paper showed that the wave equation has unique solutions on the sobolev space @xmath156 and that solutions depends continuously with respect initial data in @xmath268 .",
    "in this sense the classical singularity does not disrupt the wave dynamics .",
    "we will further explore the field regularity of these spacetimes by extending this work by linking it with quantum field theory .",
    "that means to study the quantum wave regularity of the spacetime .",
    "moreover , a concept of singular behaviour defined in terms of quantum fields rather than geodesics will provide a semi - classical picture able to use concepts from quantum field theory and general relativity .",
    "this type of analysis can then shed light on the behaviour we might find in quantum gravity .",
    "in addition , the notion of well - posedness is related to the determinism of the field equations , and in the context of general relativity this is intuitively the content of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture .",
    "current approaches to giving a precise formulation of this difficult conjecture rely precisely on the degree of differentiabilty and the notion of maximal globally hyperbolic development @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to reformulate the conjecture in terms of field regularity , which can be seen as a generalisation of the globally hyperbolic development in the context of low differentiability .",
    "this will perhaps allow one to look at the conjecture in a new way .",
    "the author would like to thank j. vickers for discussion and comments on and early draft .",
    "this work was supported by a conacyt graduate fellowship .",
