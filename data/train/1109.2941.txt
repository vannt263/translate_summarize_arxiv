    "a basic building block of a superconducting quantum bit is the josephson junction , which allows coherent cooper - pair tunneling .",
    "this josephson current provides the necessary non - linear element in an electric circuit and enables reduction of the externally controllable quantum dynamics to involve only two eigenstates  @xcite .",
    "a drawback for superconducting qubits has been that these systems can be very sensitive to various effects in their nearby environments .",
    "the influence of two major decoherence sources , charge fluctuations and two - level fluctuators , have been substantially reduced in recent years .",
    "qubits that are less sensitive to changes in background charge have been build @xcite , while fluctuators have been removed by decreasing the junction size .",
    "recently , transmons and persistent - current flux ( p - flux ) qubits with extremely long decay times have been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to investigate mechanisms of decoherence that were previously unobservable .",
    "temperature dependent decay time measurements in phase@xcite and transmon qubits@xcite suggest that non - equilibrium quasiparticles might have now become the main factor limiting the decay times of superconducting qubits .    in this work",
    "we analyze qubit decay and dephasing due to quasiparticle tunneling . as the source of tunneling we consider the two following deviations from the equilibrium bcs state of superconductors .",
    "the first one is a non - equilibrium distribution of quasiparticles , which corresponds to a finite quasiparticle density above the gap , present at all temperatures  @xcite .",
    "non - equilibrium quasiparticles could originate in a quasiparticle diffusion from higher temperature regions in an experiment , or through stray radiation , and are relatively long lived due to slow quasiparticle recombination rate   @xcite .",
    "the second process we consider is quasiparticle tunneling by breaking of a cooper pair , which can occur at typical energies of superconducting qubits if there is an extended quasiparticle density inside the gap .",
    "it has long been observed that the number of states inside the gap is vastly larger than the predictions of bcs theory  @xcite .",

    "lowest reported density for non - equilibrium quasiparticles in aluminum  @xcite we obtain p - flux qubit decay times similar to recent experiments @xcite , whereas for other qubit types the results are from two to three orders of magnitude greater than the observed ones . for niobium p - flux qubits",

    "the quasiparticle degrees of freedom in superconducting leads are modeled by the hamiltonian @xmath8 . for all further calculations",
    "the quasiparticle properties are assumed to be independent of the qubit state .",

    "we will only consider finite @xmath45 and @xmath49 .",
    "the interaction between the qubit and the quasiparticle environments occurs due to the possibility of quasiparticles to tunnel across the junction(s ) and simultaneously change the charge configuration in the qubit space .",

    "we obtain two distinct types of tunneling processes causing decoherence .",
    "the first one is tunneling of an existing quasiparticle . in the case of the bcs state",
    "this is described by an operator of the type @xmath65 this process contributes mainly in model @xmath23 .",
    "the second one is the breaking of a cooper pair , described by the bcs operator of the type @xmath66 this process contributes only in model @xmath24 .",

    "as the qubit states are superpositions of different charge states , the direction of electron tunneling becomes indistinguishable and the two tunneling processes interfere .",
    "this gives rise to a phase dependence in quasiparticle tunneling , similar to the @xmath71-term in the classical josephson effect  @xcite .",
    "this interference effect has also an important role in decoherence of superconducting qubits , as discussed below .      for the qubits considered in this work the qubit decay rate",

    "this means that for model @xmath23 the distribution @xmath38 is nonzero above the gap ( @xmath82 ) practically only in a very narrow region [ we have always @xmath83 .",
    "on the other hand , for the model @xmath24 with dynes broadening ( and @xmath49 ) one can approximate @xmath84 for a finite imaginary part @xmath46 and @xmath48 one would have @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "however , in the following we assume a dynes - type broadening @xcite when considering model @xmath24 .    in the discussed low - energy approximation",
    "we obtain the following common form for the decay rates , @xmath87 important here is that the rates are proportional to @xmath88 , defined for the two cases as @xmath89 the form @xmath90 for the decay rate ( [ eq_mainresult ] ) is a result of the interference effect in quasiparticle tunneling  @xcite ( see the discussion in section [ processes ] ) .",

    "one class of qubits have eigenstates located in a single local minimum of the qubit s potential energy , @xmath105 the lowest eigenstates are then similar to that of a harmonic oscillator and they are symmetric or antisymmetric around the local minimum . here",

    "the qubit that bucks the trend is the dc - flux qubit , which in fact is very similar to the fluxonium for @xmath108 .",
    "with its double well potential it is very different from all the other qubits .",

    "important is also that this qubit has relatively low tunneling resistance @xmath103 .",

    "this angle is given by the position of the local minimum .",
    "the potentials of the transmon and fluxonium qubits are symmetric around the phase @xmath113 , whereas the potential of the phase qubit is also practically symmetric , for certain @xmath114 . in the dc - flux qubit",

    "this provides protection against qubit decay due to non - equilibrium quasiparticles , as then the interference between two electron tunneling directions is destructive .",
    "however , this protection is only partial because for typical qubit splittings @xmath116 one has @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) .",

    "combined with the discussion of section [ discussionforsinglequbits ] , this means that at the symmetry point the dephasing is limited only by the qubit decay .      for technical reasons",

    "the contribution from @xmath261 follows the same calculation and is similar to @xmath260 , with a difference that the qubit matrix element is changed to @xmath262 .",
    "it corresponds to tunneling of an electron to the opposite direction .",
    "the contribution from @xmath263 and @xmath264 exists only if a factor @xmath265 is finite .",
    "it means that it exists if two electron tunneling directions can lead to the same final state , in a single quasiparticle tunneling process .",
    "then the processes interfere .",

    "noticing , that the contribution from @xmath264 is equal to contribution from @xmath263 , except with an opposite phase factor @xmath269 , one obtains that the principal value part gives no contribution .",

    "this expression is similar to equation ( 9 ) in ref .  ,",
    "giving also insight to the interpretation of the different terms .",
    "the main term that is missing , when compared to ref .  , is the coherent josephson term ( @xmath272-term ) , as it does not contribute in the process considered here .",

    "such coherent terms would contribute through the principal value integration .",
    "the dissipative terms are similar .",

    "a new type of measurement of this term with a superconducting charge qubit has been considered in ref .  .",
    "taking into account the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath9 by perturbation theory includes not only incoherent processes but also coherent terms leading to renormalization of the qubit parameters .",

    "using fermi distributions for the excitation occupation probabilities one obtains the famous ambegaokar - baratoff relation for @xmath20 .",
    "this corresponds to the usual choice of the josephson coupling .",
    "in addition , there exists a similar second - order contribution describing reactive behaviour of quasiparticles ( usually referred to as the capacitance renomalization ) @xmath274 to calculate this one can introduce a cut - off function @xmath275 $ ] , where @xmath276 is larger than any of the relevant energy scales in the system introduced to avoid divergence of the energy corrections . at this point",
    "this term produces a constant energy shift for all @xmath11 and therefore does not bring anything new on the system .",

    "we see that , for example , the ambegaokar - baratoff result is a good approximation as long as the approximative josephson term @xmath280 and the corresponding term coming from the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ correction ] ) almost cancel each other .",
    "it occurs if the transition probabilities to virtual states @xmath281 ( @xmath282 ) are small , or if the energies of the virtual states stay small @xmath283 . in the opposite case extra anharmonicity ( non - constant energy - level spacing ) could emerge due to this correction , as the effective tunneling coupling can become different for different states .",
    "the decoherence processes @xmath23 and @xmath24 correspond to leading order ( incoherent ) tunneling effects in the system .",
    "the most important process in higher orders is usually the andreev tunneling .",
    "this involves , for example , tunneling of two electrons from one side , with leaving two excitation behind , to form a cooper pair on the other side .",
    "such processes dominate the sub - gap conductance of normal metal - insulator - superconductor junctions for ideal bcs state on the superconductor side .",
    "however , for the case of perfect sis junctions no such process exist until the energy @xmath284 is somehow provided for creation of two excitations . the process appears as a step - like behaviour in the current - voltage characteristics of single jjs nearby @xmath285 . in experiments",
    "the height of the step is usually considerably higher than obtained by theory . the reasons for this are still unclear  @xcite .    for the case of superconducting qubits",
    "no energy is available to create two excitations , unless sub - gap density exists at one side of the junction . through creation of excitations into subgap region with creating a cooper - pair on the other side of the junction one",
    "obtains a possible contribution to the decoherence .",

    "it results that contribution from this process should be much smaller than of the process @xmath24 considered in this paper .",
