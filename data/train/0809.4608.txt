    "there is empirical evidence from photon nucleus absorption cross sections that the delta resonance changes its properties in nuclear matter substantially already at nuclear saturation density @xcite .",

    "naturally the study of the latter requires a solid understanding of the pion spectral function in nuclear matter @xcite and references in @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological spreading potential @xcite suggests a small repulsive mass shift of the isobar together with an increase of its width .",
    "also recent data on electroproduction of isobars off helium three appear consistent with the latter interpretation @xcite . with the exceptions @xcite model computations of the isobar self energy claim results compatible with a small repulsive mass shift .",
    "on naive grounds one may reject the works @xcite , that predict a sizeable attractive mass shift for the isobar , as being unrealistic and incompatible with nuclear photo absorption data .",
    "however , the situation is not clear cut .",
    "first , one may observe that various detailed works @xcite adjust their model parameters as to reproduce the spreading potential @xcite and therefore can not be taken as a microscopic confirmation of a repulsive isobar mass shift .",
    "second , one should recall the argument put forward in @xcite that the apparent mass shift seen in photo absorption data is affected significantly by short range correlation effects .",
    "thus an attractive isobar mass shift can not be ruled out , since the phenomenological spreading potential @xcite is effective in the sense that the latter effects were not explicitly accounted for .",
    "the purpose of this work is a study of the photoabsorption cross section off nuclei based on a self consistent and covariant many body approach for the pion and isobar propagation in infinite nuclear matter that takes into account short range correlation effects consistently .",

    "following the arguments put forward in @xcite , we consider the lagrangian densities ( [ def - l ] , [ def - em - terms ] ) to be effective and allow their parameters to enjoy a residual but smooth density dependence .",

    "the upper - left panel shows the relevance of various contributions , the upper - right panel the effect of short - range correlations in the @xmath111 vertex .",
    "the lower - left panel follows if bare @xmath111 and @xmath112 vertices are assumed .",
    "the solid lines give the complete calculations , the dashed lines the resonance contributions , the dashed - dotted lines the background contributions and the dotted lines the two - particle hole contributions .",
    "the lower - right panel illustrates the importance of in - medium effects on the background processes .",
    "the short - dashed dotted line provides the background contribution evaluated with bare vertices and a free - space pion .",
    "the data are taken from @xcite .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    in figure [ fig:6 ] we study the importance of various contributions and approximations . in the left upper panel the contributions of the resonance , background and the one of the particle hole contributions are compared with the full result .",
    "the background contribution , defined by all but the first diagram of figure [ fig:3 ] , is essentially flat and delivers about 100 @xmath113b to the cross section .",
    "the resonance itself contributes about 200 @xmath113b in the peak while the two - particle hole final states deliver an additional 50 @xmath113b . as can be seen when adding up all contributions incoherently interference effects play a minor role only .",
    "we turn to the upper - right panel of figure [ fig:6 ] , which illustrates the importance of vertex corrections .",
    "the solid line of that panel gives our result implied by the parameter set ( [ standardparameter ] ) but a bare @xmath114 vertex in the production amplitudes @xmath115 and @xmath116 of ( [ def - agammapin ] ) .",
    "the neglect of short - range correlation effects in the @xmath117 vertex implies a significant shift of the isobar strength about 50 mev towards lower energies .",
    "thus the apparent peak position seen in the absorption cross section does not directly reflect the isobar contribution .",
    "a realistic prediction of the in - medium isobar mass requires the proper consideration of such effects . an even more dramatic influence of short - range correlation effects",
    "is documented by the lower - left panel of figure [ fig:6 ] . here",
    "we assume again the parameters set ( [ standardparameter ] ) but also bare @xmath117 and @xmath118 vertices .",
    "the pion and isobar propagators used are obtained within the self consistent and covariant approach @xcite , where correspondingly a bare @xmath118 vertex was taken .",
    "this calculation corresponds to the dashed lines in figure 4 of @xcite . as anticipated by our previous study @xcite a neglect of short - range correlation effects in the @xmath118 vertex leads to a much broader isobar which then translates into an almost flat photoabsorption cross section .",
    "we finally turn to the lower - right panel of figure [ fig:6 ] . here",
    "we focus on the background contributions .",
    "while the dashed - dotted line shows the full background contribution , the short dashed - dotted line gives the result for the background processes implied when using a bare pion propagator and bare vertices in figure 3 .",
    "the vertex correction in the background terms are essential to keep our approach consistent .",
    "an approximative treatment in which the in - medium spectral distribution of the pion is neglected would lead to a strong underestimation of the background processes . in this case",
    "the pauli - blocking effect would cut away the low - energy cross section as can be seen from figure [ fig:6 ] .",
    "we emphasize that the consideration of such effects is crucial to arrive at a realistic estimate for migdal s parameter @xmath100 .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with previous studies .",
    "we find a qualitative agreement with the results of @xcite , which claimed an attractive mass shift for the isobar in nuclear matter based on a perturbative and non - relativistic many - body approach .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the more recent works @xcite , which claim small and repulsive mass shifts of the isobar in cold nuclear matter .",
    "the differences are traced to the neglect of important short - range correlation effects and the use of a soft and phenomenological form factor in the @xmath118 vertex @xcite .",
    "we presented a first computation of the nuclear photoabsorption cross section that considered the effect of short range - correlations effects in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 vertices .",
    "we applied the self consistent and covariant many - body approach developed by the authors for the @xmath118 systems in the presence of short - range correlation effects .",
    "in particular the in - medium interference of the s - channel isobar exchange and the t - channel pion exchange was evaluated consistently with an in - medium pion propagator .",
    "it was shown that the latter plays an important role in the determination of migdal s parameter @xmath119 , for which we obtained a rather large value .",
    "an accurate reproduction of the photoabsorption data was achieved .",
    "based on our analysis we predict an attractive mass shift of about 50 mev for the isobar in cold and saturated nuclear matter .",
