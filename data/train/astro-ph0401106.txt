    "intergalactic space within clusters of galaxies contains enormous quantities of gas that is at the virial temperature . in about three quarters of all rich clusters ,",
    "the temperature falls by a factor of 2 to 3 within a few tens of kiloparsecs of the cluster centre ",
    "such clusters are said to possess a ` cooling flow ' .",
    "nearby examples are the virgo , hydra and perseus clusters .",
    "optical emission - line filaments are observed around ngc 1275 at the centre of the perseus cluster ( minkowski 1957 ; lynds 1970 ;",
    "conselice , gallagher & wyse 2001 , and reference therein ) . similar structures of extended @xmath11 emission are seen near the centres of other cooling - flow clusters ( e.g. , virgo , hydra , a2597 , a2052 , a1795 ; see heckman 1981 ; hu , cowie & wang 1985 ; johnstone , fabian & nulsen 1987 ; heckman et al . 1989 ) .",
    "the origin of these filaments and the mechanism responsible for their ionization have been extensively studied , but definitive conclusions have not been reached .",
    "two formation scenarios have been proposed . in the first , the filaments form as the intracluster medium ( icm ) cools ( e.g. , fabian & nulsen 1977 , cowie , fabian & nulsen 1980 ) . in the other scenario ,",
    "filaments are produced through cosmic infall of either cold gas or gas - rich galaxies ( e.g. , soker , bregman & sarazin 1991 ; baum 1992 ; sparks 1992 ) .",
    "the fact that filaments are observed _ only _ in clusters with cooling flows has often been considered evidence for the first scenario , but by no means all cooling - flow clusters have detectable optical emission lines ( e.g. , a2029 ; see fabian 1994 ) .",
    "some observational data favour the infall scenario .",
    "for example , sparks , macchetto & golombek ( 1989 ) showed that filaments contain dust with normal galactic extinction properties , which filaments formed by condensation of the icm should not ( see also donahue & voit 1993 ) .",
    "in addition , the filaments appear to be dynamically disturbed systems , suggesting that they form through violent processes , such as merging , rather through the quiescent condensation of the x - ray emitting icm .",
    "an important related question is , what mechanism is responsible for heating the filaments ?",
    "many possible ionization sources have been considered : active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ; shocks ; massive stars ; radiation from the icm ; magnetic reconnection ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "none of these ionization mechanisms , individually , can satisfactory account for the observed emission - line ratios and intensities , so possible combinations of these processes have been explored ( e.g. , sabra , shields & filippenko 2000 )",
    ". however , there are indications that the heating source is physically associated with the filaments ( conselice et .",
    "al 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "thus , it is likely that stellar photoionization makes an important contribution to powering their optical emission - lines , since young stars are systematically found in the filaments ( e.g. , mcnamara , oconnell & sarazin 1996 ) .",
    "the existence of cool filaments embedded in hot ambient plasma has implications for the problem of the plasma s thermal conductivity , which must be moderated by the intracluster magnetic field .",
    "if the conductivity were high , one would expect the filaments to evaporate rapidly .",
    "thus , in principle , their very existence limits the conductivity in the same way that of cold fronts in the icm does ( markevitch et al .",
    "2000 , 2003 ) . given our very limited understanding of the connectedness of the intergalactic magnetic field , and the possibility that thermal conductivity contributes significantly to the global dynamics of cooling flows ( narayan & medvedev 2001 , voigt & fabian 2003 and references therein ) , observational constraints on thermal conductivity are valuable .",
    "in this paper we address two main questions :    1 .",
    "why are cold filaments observed only in cooling - flow clusters ? and why only in the cluster core ? 2 .   to",
    "what degree does the existence of these filaments constrain the thermal conductivity of the icm ?",
    "the competition between evaporation and condensation when a cool body of plasma is immersed in a hotter ambient medium has been studied extensively in the literature ( graham & langer 1973 ; cowie & mckee 1977 ; mckee & cowie 1977 ; balbus & mckee 1982 ; giuliani 1984 ; draine & giuliani 1984 ; balbus 1986 ; bhringer & hartquist 1987 ; bhringer & fabian 1989 ; mckee & begelman 1990 ; ferrara & shchekinov 1993 ) .",
    "most effort has been devoted either to spherical clouds or to planar inhomogeneities , although cowie & songaila ( 1977 ) considered spheroidal clouds .",
    "since the morphology of observed filaments suggests that cylindrical symmetry should provide a useful idealization , we revisit the problem for this case , and discuss the implications of our results for real systems .    in any geometry ,",
    "clouds below some critical size are evaporated , while clouds above this size grow by condensation of the hot medium .",
    "we determine the critical size that separates these two regimes by finding the steady - state solution in which conductivity exactly balances radiative losses .",
    "the typical size of observed filaments is likely to be comparable to the critical size : much smaller filaments are rapidly evaporated away , while filaments above this critical value grow slowly , at a rate determined by the cooling time . significantly larger filaments are expected to be very rare : in principle , if they formed they could fundamentally change the nature of the system by eliminating the cooling hot ambient plasma .    in section  2",
    "we derive the critical cylindrical solution . in section  3",
    "we discuss the application of the model to cluster filaments .",
    "our conclusions are in section  4 .",
    "we consider a long cylindrically symmetric cloud in which there is perfect balance between conductive heat flow towards the symmetry axis and radiative losses , so the plasma flows neither inwards nor outwards ( see mckee & cowie 1977 ) .",
    "the temperature on the axis is assumed to be @xmath1 , while far from the origin @xmath12 asymptotes to a value @xmath13 . with these assumptions , and neglecting the effects of gravity , the energy equation reads @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the heat flux , @xmath16 is the electron number density , and @xmath17 is the normalized cooling function . in the unsaturated thermal conduction regime ,",
    "the heat flux is given by @xmath18 with @xmath19 thermal conductivity .",
    "for a hydrogen plasma , in the absence of magnetic fields , spitzer ( 1962 ) derives @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the coulomb logarithm , which is only weakly dependent on @xmath16 and @xmath12 ( in the following we assume @xmath23 ) .",
    "confinement of thermal electrons by the intracluster magnetic field reduces the actual conductivity to @xmath24 where the parameter @xmath25 is the heat conduction suppression factor ( e.g. , binney & cowie 1981 , bhringer & fabian 1989 ) .    at least in some clusters",
    ", observations indicate that emission - line nebulae are in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding hot plasma ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "so we require that the pressure @xmath26 is constant throughout the interface , and we use this relation to eliminate @xmath16 in the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eqen ] ) .",
    "thus , under the assumption of cylindrical symmetry , eliminating @xmath15 with the help of equations ( [ eqhf ] ) and ( [ eqkappa2 ] ) , the energy equation  ( [ eqen ] ) is reduced to the differential equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the cylindrical radius .",
    "equation ( [ eqencyl ] ) applies outside the edge at @xmath29 of the @xmath1 cloud : we assume that the cloud contains its own heat sources , such as photoionizing stars , so on its surface the temperature gradient and heat flux vanish .",
    "we require @xmath12 to attain some specified value on @xmath30 .",
    "thus we solve equation ( [ eqencyl ] ) subject to three boundary conditions , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , the temperature of the ambient hot plasma , which varies with distance from the cluster centre .",
    "for completeness we will explore the wide range @xmath34 .    introducing the dimensionless quantities @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , equation  ( [ eqencyl ] ) reads @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an unknown dimensionless parameter that is the eigenvalue of equation ( [ eqxitau ] ) .",
    "expressed in dimensionless variables , the boundary conditions are @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 . due to the presence of @xmath46 , the eigenfunctions @xmath47 and eigenvalues @xmath48 depend on the outer temperature @xmath5 in addition to the dimensionless numbers @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the inner and outer radii @xmath29 and @xmath51 can not be exactly identified with observational quantities .",
    "however , we can assume that @xmath29 corresponds approximately to the width of the filament , and @xmath51 to its length @xmath10 .",
    "the latter assumption is consistent with the hypothesis of cylindrical geometry , which does not hold at @xmath52 .",
    "observed filaments are highly elongated , with ratios length / width @xmath53 ( conselice et al .",
    "thus , we explore a range of values of @xmath49 that satisfy @xmath54 .",
    "equation  ( [ eqxitau ] ) is non  linear and would require numerical integration even if @xmath55 were approximated by a simple analytical function .",
    "thus , use of the tabulated cooling function of sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) for metallicity @xmath56=-0.5 $ ] introduces no additional computational complexity .",
    "we use a shooting method , with newton iteration , to calculate the solutions .    numerical integration of equation  ( [ eqxitau ] )",
    "shows that , for any fixed @xmath5 in the range considered , the value of @xmath48 is virtually independent of @xmath49 , provided that @xmath49 is sufficiently small ( i.e. , @xmath57 ) .",
    "thus , in what follows we can simplify our treatment by assuming that the eigenvalue @xmath48 depends only on @xmath5 .",
    "although the details of the _ inner _ temperature profile @xmath47 depend significantly on @xmath49 , the behaviour of the profile at @xmath58 is virtually independent of @xmath49 provided @xmath59 .",
    "henceforth we set @xmath60 so that _ both @xmath48 and the observationally significant part of @xmath47 are independent on the exact radial range considered_.    fig .",

    "@xmath48 spans a relatively small range _",
    "( @xmath62 ) , which is reduced to @xmath63 for @xmath64 .    from fig .",
    "[ figtprof ] is apparent that over a significant fraction of the radial range the temperature profiles are roughly power laws , with similar indices .",
    "this suggests that an approximate analytical solution could be obtained by exploring the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenfunctions of equation  ( [ eqxitau ] ) for @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) .",

    "the run of the eigenvalue as a function of @xmath5 ( fig .",

    "we now discuss the physical implications of the results presented in the previous section .",
    "equation  ( [ eqlambda ] ) relates the numerical value of @xmath48 to the dimensional quantities associated with a filament and its surroundings .",

    "numerically we have @xmath77 this equation indicates that @xmath76 has a strong dependence on the outer temperature ( @xmath78 , neglecting the weak dependence of @xmath48 on @xmath5 ; see fig .",
    "[ figlam ] ) , and also is inversely proportional to the pressure @xmath79 . even though the dependence of @xmath76 on the thermal conduction suppression factor @xmath8 is not very strong ( @xmath80 ) , @xmath8 can significantly affect @xmath76",
    "because the value of @xmath8 is very uncertain : @xmath81 seems to be excluded , but different authors gives values differing by two orders of magnitude , from a few @xmath82 to @xmath83  see narayan & medvedev ( 2001 ) for a discussion .",

    "[ figrmaxtmax ] shows @xmath85 from equation  ( [ eqrmaxtmax ] ) , for pressure @xmath86 , which is a typical value in the core of a cooling - flow galaxy cluster [ e.g. , for the perseus cluster , conselice et al .",

    "for given @xmath8 , the relation @xmath85 divides the the diagram in two regions : filaments longer than @xmath76 are condensing , while smaller ones are evaporating .",
    "it is apparent from the steep slope of the curves in the diagram that the process of evaporation or condensation of filaments is very sensitive to the temperature of the ambient medium . for a plausible value of the suppression factor , @xmath88 , at fixed pressure @xmath89 , any filament longer than @xmath90 is condensing in a cluster with ambient temperature @xmath91 , while filaments as long as @xmath92 are evaporating if @xmath93 .",
    "although @xmath76 depends on pressure more weakly than on temperature , pressure also plays an important role in determining the fate of filaments .",
    "this is apparent in the right diagram of fig .",
    "[ figrmaxtmax ] , where we fix @xmath94 and plot @xmath76 as a function of @xmath3 , for the set of values of @xmath8 considered above .",
    "the diagram shows that , at fixed temperature , in low - pressure clusters virtually all filaments are evaporating ( e.g. , @xmath95 for @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) , but condensation is effective in the highest - pressure ambient gas ( @xmath98 for @xmath99 and @xmath97 ) .",
    "what are the characteristic time - scales for evaporation and condensation of filaments ?",
    "a detailed answer to this question would require the solution of the full hydrodynamic equations for non - vanishing mass flow .",
    "however , for the purpose of our investigation we are interested in an order of magnitude estimate , which can be obtained by considering that the time variation of temperature is described by a differential equation of the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the thermal conduction and cooling time - scales , respectively .",
    "the relation between these time - scales is given by @xmath103 because @xmath104 , where @xmath10 is the temperature variation length scale ( begelman & mckee 1990 ) .",
    "in the considered case , @xmath10 is the radial extension of the interface , which is of the order of the filament length ( see section  2 ) .",
    "considering that the equilibrium solution ( @xmath105 ) corresponds to @xmath106 , from equation  ( [ eqtktc ] ) we get @xmath107 and equation  ( [ eqdtdt ] ) can be approximated as @xmath108.\\ ] ] consequently , filaments shorter than @xmath109 evaporate in a fraction @xmath110 of the cooling time , which for example is @xmath111 within @xmath112 of the centre of the hydra cluster , ( david et al .",
    "filaments smaller than @xmath0 by a factor @xmath113 have evaporation times @xmath114 that are smaller than their likely dynamical times , @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the typical gas velocity estimated from line widths ( sabra et al . 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "on the other hand , equation  ( [ eqdtdt2 ] ) in the limit @xmath117 indicates that , as expected , very long filaments condense on time - scales of the order of the cooling time of the ambient medium .",
    "these considerations strongly support the hypothesis that _ only filaments with lengths comparable to the critical length or longer are likely to survive for long enough to be observed_.      the results presented above have interesting implications , when compared with the properties of observed galaxy clusters .    1 .",
    "a first simplistic implication is that , due to the strong dependence of @xmath76 on temperature , in massive ( high - temperature ) clusters most cold gas structures are evaporating , while even relatively small clouds can survive ( and condense ) in small ( low - temperature ) clusters . on the other hand one needs to bear in mind that clusters with higher temperatures have larger virial radii @xmath118 , and it is natural to expect the typical size of clouds to increase proportional to @xmath118 .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figrmaxtmax ] shows the relation between @xmath118 and the virial temperature ( @xmath119 ) predicted for galaxy clusters under the assumption of self - similarity ( the slope of this scaling relation is consistent with that derived from x - ray observations of galaxy clusters ; see , e.g. , ettori , de grandi & molendi 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "thus , as is apparent from the diagram , the relation @xmath85 is much steeper than the relation between cluster size and temperature .",
    "hence , in the highest - temperature clusters any cold filament is evaporating , while in the lowest - temperature clusters , any resolvable filament is condensing .",
    "the scenario presented in the previous point would hold under the assumption that the physical properties ( gas density and pressure ) of clusters of given temperature would not differ significantly from cluster to cluster .",
    "in fact , we know this is not the case : for fixed gas temperature , non  cooling - flow clusters ( i.e. , ones with long cooling times ) have , by definition , lower central density ( and pressure ) than cooling - flow clusters .",
    "thus , as shown by the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figrmaxtmax ] , since @xmath120 , a filament long enough to be condensing in the core of a cooling - flow cluster with central temperature @xmath12 might evaporate if it were at the centre of a non  cooling - flow cluster with the same temperature ( but lower density ) .",
    "this argument suggests that filaments of cold gas are not observed in non  cooling - flow clusters because in these clusters they are evaporated very efficiently , even at the cluster centre . on the other hand ,",
    "whatever their formation mechanism , filaments are more likely to survive and grow in the denser , higher pressure cores of cooling - flow clusters .",
    "3 .   in a given cooling - flow cluster , @xmath12 increases as one moves away from the centre , while @xmath3 falls .",
    "consequently , equation ( [ eqrmaxtmax ] ) predicts that @xmath76 increases rapidly with distance from the cluster centre .",
    "this result explains why , even in the infall or merging scenario for the formation of the filaments , these are observed only in the cooling cores of clusters , and not in the outer regions .",
    "for example , in the perseus cluster , the gas temperature at a distance @xmath121 from the center is roughly twice the central temperature .",
    "also , in the same radial range the pressure decreases by a factor of @xmath122 ( e.g. , schimdt et al .",
    "2002 ; churazov et al .",
    "thus , equation  ( [ eqrmaxtmax ] ) predicts that @xmath76 grows by over a factor of 10 between the centre and @xmath9 .",
    "interestingly , even in the core , observations indicate that the mean @xmath11 emission is a strongly decreasing function of the cluster radius ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "this result may arise because as one moves out , @xmath11 emission from smaller filaments contributes less and less to the overall signal .",
    "we can summarize the points above by considering the relation between @xmath76 and the cooling time of ambient gas . for simplicity",
    ", we use the approximate isobaric cooling time @xmath123 ( where @xmath16 is in @xmath124 and @xmath12 in @xmath125 ; e.g. , sarazin 1986 ) , considering the temperature range @xmath126 . the dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fignt ] represent the loci of constant cooling time in density - temperature space , while the solid curves show the loci of constant @xmath76 , for suppression factor @xmath97 .",
    "we see that if the cooling time is long ( as in the cores of non cooling - flow clusters , and in the outer regions of any cluster ) , @xmath76 is large , so evaporation is very likely . on the other and , small",
    "@xmath76 corresponds to a short cooling time .",
    "hence _ it is precisely the physical conditions found in the cores of cooling - flow clusters that favour condensation_.      as outlined in the introduction , the existence of cold filaments could be used to constrain the value of the thermal conductivity in the icm .",
    "indeed , we could derive the value of the suppression factor @xmath8 from equation  ( [ eqrmaxtmax ] ) if we knew all the other quantities involved .",
    "unfortunately , while @xmath5 and @xmath3 are well constrained by observations , it is quite difficult to put strong observational constraints on @xmath76 .",
    "a detailed morphological study of the filaments , available only for the perseus cluster ( conselice et al .",
    "2001 ) , reveals complex structures on different scales .",
    "however , we note that even a quite conservative estimate of @xmath76 can lead to interesting constraints on @xmath8 . for instance",
    ", the data suggest that in the perseus cluster filaments @xmath92 long are present at least up to radii @xmath127 .",
    "this means @xmath128 , where the icm temperature and pressure are @xmath129 and @xmath130 , respectively ( schmidt et al . 2002 ) . according to equation  ( [ eqrmaxtmax ] ) , for these physical properties of the ambient medium , this condition",
    "is translated into the _ upper limit _",
    "@xmath131 for the thermal conduction suppression factor .",
    "this result is compatible with that found by markevitch et al .",
    "( 2003 ) on the basis of observations of cold fronts in a754 .",
    "we note that a substantially higher efficiency would be required in order for the thermal conductivity to significantly affect cooling flows in the centres of clusters ( e.g. , narayan & medvedev 2001 ) .    in the discussion above we considered the thermal conduction suppression factor as a global parameter characterizing the icm in clusters .",
    "in fact , the reduction of thermal conductivity could vary from cluster to cluster , or within a given cluster , depending on the detailed properties of the magnetic field . however , there are indications that the effect of the reconnection of the magnetic field lines between the filaments and the icm would be to enhance the efficiency of heat conduction in the centres of cooling - flow clusters ( soker , blanton & sarazin 2004 ) .",
    "thus , at least according to this scenario , it seems reasonable to extend the derived upper limit on @xmath8 to the icm in general .      here",
    "we explore the possibility that the conduction fronts described above can be detected in soft x - rays .",
    "this is particularly interesting since fabian et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find soft x - ray emission associated with the brightest @xmath11 emission filaments around ngc1275 , suggesting that it is produced in the conductive evaporation or condensation of the filaments .",
    "we quantify the emission properties of the conduction fronts for the considered cylindrically symmetric clouds , computing the differential emission measure @xmath132 where @xmath16 is the electron number density and @xmath133 is the volume element . under the hypothesis of constant pressure @xmath134 , the differential emission measure can be related directly to the temperature profile @xmath61 : using @xmath135 , with @xmath10 length of the filament , we get @xmath136 as discussed in section  2 , the temperature profile , for given @xmath5 , can be considered independent of @xmath49 at large enough radii ( @xmath58 ) ; correspondingly we find that the differential emission measure at @xmath137 is not sensitive to the value of @xmath49 .",

    "we assume @xmath141 , and @xmath142 , in accordance with the discussion in section  2 . due to the dependence of @xmath76 on the thermal conduction suppression factor @xmath8 ( equation [ eqrmaxtmax ] ) ,",
    "the normalization of @xmath140 is proportional to @xmath143 .",
    "thus it is difficult to make predictions on the absolute value of the emission measure , also because of the strong dependence on pressure . on the other hand ,",
    "the shape of @xmath140 is not affected by these parameters , being determined by the temperature profile , which depends only on the temperature of the ambient medium . as apparent from fig .",
    "[ figem ] , in the considered temperature range the differential emission measure can be roughly approximated with a power - law @xmath144 .",
    "we find that @xmath140 is steeper for lower @xmath5 , with best  fitting slope @xmath145 ranging from @xmath146 for @xmath147 to @xmath148 for @xmath91 .",
    "accurate measurements of the soft x - ray spectra around filaments could be interestingly compared with the slopes of these emission measure profiles .",
    "embedded within cooling flows , one frequently detects filaments of cold gas .",
    "thermal conduction will cause heat to flow into these filaments from the hot ambient gas , with the result that filaments below a critical size will be evaporated . on the other hand radiative cooling",
    "is very efficient in cold , dense gas , so larger filaments can survive , and indeed nucleate the cooling of the ambient medium .",
    "we have determined the critical filamentary size that divides the two regimes .",
    "the absolute value of this length scale , @xmath0 , is uncertain because we do not know how effectively the magnetic field suppresses thermal conduction .",
    "by contrast , the way in which @xmath0 scales with the temperature and pressure of the ambient medium is well determined and leads to suggestive results .",
    "the critical length scale rises sharply with ambient temperature : @xmath149 , and decreases as @xmath6 with ambient pressure .",
    "consequently , in the perseus cluster @xmath0 increases by over an order of magnitude between the cluster centre and a radius of @xmath9 , where it is probably larger than @xmath150 . within a few kiloparsecs of the cluster centre , filaments only a kiloparsec long may either grow , or at least take a long time to evaporate because their lengths are just below the critical value , while such small filaments are rapidly evaporated in the main body of the cluster .    where do filaments come from in the first place ?",
    "they can not emerge spontaneously from the ambient medium because this is thermally stable , in clusters .",
    "it is also the case that for technical reasons balbus had to insist on a highly artificial background field for which field - line closure is problematic .",
    "] so they must be injected .",
    "simulations of structure formation predict that significant amounts of cold gas fall into clusters ( katz et al . 2003 ) , and the observed filaments could represent just the fraction of this infall that reaches the centre .",
    "there is also some indication that extremely close to the cluster centre a small amount of gas cools to filamentary temperatures , and some of this gas could be ejected by the agn to the radii where filaments are observed .",
    "whether infall or agn are responsible for injecting filamentary gas , there is no reason to expect the lengths of the injected filaments to have a characteristic value .",
    "it is natural to think in terms of a spectrum of filamentary lengths @xmath10 , in which the number of filaments decreases with increasing filament length , probably as a power law .",
    "observations of filaments would then be dominated by filaments with @xmath151 because shorter filaments would be rapidly evaporated , and larger ones would be rare . the local number density of filaments would be a decreasing function of @xmath0 , explaining why observed filaments are concentrated near the centres of cooling - flow clusters .",
    "since filament growth depends on the efficiency of radiative cooling , @xmath0 tends to be small when the cooling time of the ambient medium is short .",
    "hence clusters with short central cooling times , have smaller values of @xmath0 and more filaments than clusters with similar temperatures but longer cooling times .",
    "consequently , it is natural that filaments are only detected in cooling - flow clusters .",
    "for the case of a filament of critical length , we have calculated the temperature profile throughout the interface between gas at @xmath152 that emits optical emission lines , and the ambient x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "this profile yields the run of differential emission measure with temperature , which can be tested observationally .    as cosmic clustering proceeds ,",
    "the temperature of gas that is trapped in gravitational potential wells rises as longer and longer length - scale perturbations collapse .",
    "this temperature rise causes @xmath0 to rise much faster than the virial radius of the potential well .",
    "hence , while at early times filaments that are much smaller than the system can grow , growth is later restricted to filaments that are comparable in size to the entire system .",
    "consequently , the ability of infalling cold gas to nucleate star formation declines as clustering proceeds .",
    "semi - analytic models of galaxy formation that can account for the observed slope of the galaxy luminosity function at the faint end need efficient feedback from star formation , and over - produce luminous galaxies ( benson et al .",
    "binney ( 2003 ) has argued that galaxy formation is dominated by infall of cold gas , and that it is the efficient evaporation of filaments in massive systems that suppresses the formation of massive galaxies .",
