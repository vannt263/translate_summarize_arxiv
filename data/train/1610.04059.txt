    "we conclude that spin - orbit coupling in c@xmath1h is weak and does not produce magnetic anisotropy . since the role of magnetic anisotropy is decisive in the formation of a long - range magnetic order in 2d materials @xcite , no long - range ordering is expected in c@xmath1h at finite temperatures according to the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite .    in the case of the semifluorinated graphene",

    "[ magn_config](left ) ] .",
    "there is a solution with zero isotropic magnetic interactions at @xmath50 = 40 mev , when the ferromagnetic direct exchange interaction exactly compensates the antiferromagnetic anderson s superexchange .",
    "thus we conclude that c@xmath1f can be considered to be at the threshold of the antiferromagnetic - ferromagnetic instability .",
    "our investigation of the semifluorinated and semihydrogenated graphene revealed that these systems are physical realizations of different spin models on the triangular lattice .",
    "such a lattice is of special interest due to the effects of magnetic frustration and possibility to form topologically protected spin textures , skyrmions at finite temperatures and magnetic fields .",
    "for instance , it was recently shown that skyrmionic states can be stabilized in the @xmath53 model with the ferromagnetic nearest neighbor and antiferromagnetic next - nearest neighbour exchange interactions.@xcite a similar model is derived in our study for c@xmath1h .",
    "however , the ratio @xmath54 is much larger than that proposed in ref .   to stabilize a skyrmion state .",
    "another important example known from the literature is the antiferromagnetic ( or ferromagnetic ) triangular lattice with dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions that favour formation of the antiferromagnetic skyrmion lattice state@xcite ( or a skyrmion lattice state with the nel - type domain wall alignment @xcite ) .",
    "a similar scenario can be realized in the c@xmath1f system .    to check whether it is possible to stabilize a distinct spin texture in the semifluorinated graphene we have performed classical monte carlo simulations based on the single - spin metropolis update scheme and the heat bath method combined with overrelaxation for the spin models obtained with different values of @xmath50 . in our calculations supercells of various size from @xmath55 to @xmath56 spins with periodic boundary conditions were used , and a single run contained @xmath57 monte - carlo steps .",
    "while different states can be identified from a real space spin configuration , we have also computed the static spin structure factors : @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath60 means the monte - carlo averaged configuration , as well as the so - called local chirality @xmath61 that is regarded as an order parameter of the corresponding magnetic state .    in the case of the c@xmath1f spin models obtained with @xmath51 40 mev ,",
    "the antiferromagnetic skyrmion lattice state is destroyed by a weak @xmath35 component of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , instead the 120@xmath3 nel state is observed .",
    "the situation is different for the c@xmath1f spin models with @xmath52 40 mev . in this case",
    "a nel type skyrmion state can be realized .",

    "[ montecarloski](a ) was obtained with the exchange interactions @xmath62 = 1.9 mev and @xmath27 = ( 0 , -0.93 , -0.28 ) at the temperature @xmath63= 0.02 and the magnetic field @xmath64 = 0.1 .",
    "fig.[montecarloski](b ) gives the intensity of the spin structure factor for the obtained texture .",
    "there is a superposition of three spirals with @xmath65 pairs of the wave vectors , which is a clear indication of the skyrmion lattice state .",
    "taking into account the estimated value of the @xmath39-factor @xmath39=2.025 , the critical magnetic field needed to stabilize the skyrmion lattice can be defined as 1.62 t. for this set of parameters the size of the individual skyrmion can be estimated to be about 25  .",
    "generally , it is controlled by the ratio @xmath66 and the magnetic field .",
    "our theoretical results indicate that the recent experimental realization of c@xmath1f @xcite opens a way for exploiting truly two - dimensional one - band model materials demonstrating a rich variety of physical properties , such as the strong dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , spatial charge correlations , magnetic frustration , skyrmion state and others .",
    "specifically , we found that the wannier functions describing magnetic moments in the c@xmath1f and c@xmath1h systems form a triangular lattice with completely different hopping paths .",
    "the overlap of the neighbouring wannier orbitals results in a strong direct ferromagnetic exchange interaction for both systems in question that can partially or fully compensate the kinetic superexchange interaction between nearest magnetic orbitals . for the semihydrogenated graphene",
    "we predict a short - range ferromagnetic order .",
    "since our hartree - fock calculations do not reveal any magnetic anisotropy in c@xmath1h , the long - range magnetic order in this system is unstable as follows from the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite for two - dimensional systems .",
    "the calculations of the anisotropic exchange interactions suggest that c@xmath1f can be considered as a physical realization of the heisenberg model with dmi on the triangular lattice .",
    "the variation of @xmath15 from the fully screened to bare limits leads to either the 120@xmath3 nel or skyrmion states as it was predicted by our hartree - fock and monte carlo simulations .",
    "the key parameter that is responsible for a variety of magnetic states in c@xmath1f and c@xmath1h is the direct exchange interaction , @xmath67 between the neighbouring wannier functions .",
    "experimentally , one can find different mechanisms to control and tune this interaction .",
    "for instance , in this paper we demonstrate that @xmath67 is sensitive to the screening by the background .",
    "the latter can be changed by coupling with a substrate . @xcite",
    "another attractive control parameter is strain that strongly affects non - local coulomb interactions in graphene systems as it was shown in ref .  .",
