    "there has been considerable interest in paired superfluidity of trapped fermi gases , where the interatomic interaction can be tuned by varying the external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "recently , the experimental realization of superfluidity in polarized fermi gases attracts great attention , where the numbers @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the two atomic species undergoing pairing are different  @xcite .",
    "this population imbalance is obviously detrimental to superfluidity , since the cooper pairing requires equal number of atoms from both spin components .",
    "therefore , by increasing the population imbalance from zero , it is expected that the bcs pairing state becomes less favorable and eventually gives its way to the normal or other exotic phases  @xcite .",
    "one of the most fascinating phenomena in unbalanced fermi systems is the larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrel ( loff ) states , which was first discussed as a `` compromise '' candidate exhibiting both pairing and non - zero magnetization in the context of superconductors in the presence of a magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "this exotic loff state is characterized by an order parameter with one or more non - zero components at finite momenta @xmath2 , hence breaks translational and rotational symmetry and forms a crystal of pairing order ( i.e. , a supersolid ) . in the past several decades",
    ", the existence of loff states was studied in various systems  @xcite , including heavy fermions  @xcite and dense quark matter  @xcite .    comparing to the systems mentioned above ,",
    "ultra - cold fermi gases provide a super clean experimental platform with remarkable controllability , so that they can be studied with nearly arbitrary interaction strength and population imbalance . therefore , after the realization of paired superfluidity in resonantly interacting @xmath3li atoms with population imbalance  @xcite , the interest of loff state in these systems has been greatly intensified . up to now , no evidence of loff state has been found yet in experiments on the polarized fermi gas . theoretically , some existing studies give significantly different predictions on the stable region of loff state : some works on the homogeneous system conclude that at zero temperature the loff state is confined to a narrow parameter region on the bcs side of the resonance , for both cases of a narrow  @xcite and a wide @xcite feshbach resonance ; while some other calculations claim a much larger region of a stable loff state  @xcite , well existing at the unitarity point .",
    "what is subtle for these calculations is to implement a right set of stability conditions , which are usually controversial . considering that there exist various possible competing phase configurations for this system , one thus needs to carefully distinguish a stable phase from some metastable states or unstable saddle point solutions .    in this manuscript",
    ", we consider the possibility of loff state and map out the detailed finite temperature phase diagram for fermionic atoms in a trap with population imbalance .",
    "to ensure stability , we directly minimize the thermodynamical potential instead of using the order parameter equations , as the latter may give unstable or metastable solutions  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the full landscape of thermodynamical potential sounds to us the only method capable to distinguish a local metastable configuration from a globally stable phase . to deal with the trap",
    ", we use the local density approximation ( lda ) which is typically valid unless the trap has a strong anisotropy and/or the total atom number is small  @xcite .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "( i ) we conclude that a stable loff state can only be present on the bcs side of the feshbach resonance . on the bec side and at the unitarity",
    ", the loff state is only a metastable state .",
    "( ii ) even on the bcs side of the resonance , a globally stable loff state is only restricted at low temperatures and in a small region of the trap . in a wider temperature and spatial region ,",
    "the loff state is only a metastable state . considering experimental limit of temperature and resolution",
    ", we expect that a direct observation of stable loff states is challenging for polarized fermi gases in typical harmonic traps .",
    "the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : formalism ] , we discuss our formalism for unbalanced fermi gases in an isotropic harmonic trap .",
    "we first derive a ginzburg  landau theory for the second order normal - loff and normal - bcs phase transitions , and then derive the mean - field thermodynamical potential to study the first order normal - loff and loff - bcs phase transitions . in the mean - field calculation , for simplicity , we focus on the single - plane - wave loff state ( i.e. , the ff state ) .",
    "our main results are presented in section  [ sec : phasediagram ] , where the phase diagrams showing various stable or metastable states are illustrated for systems at unitarity , and on the bcs and bec sides of the feshbach resonance .",
    "since the population of closed channel molecules is negligible close to a wide feshbach resonance  @xcite , we study a trapped fermi gas by considering the following single - channel hamiltonian ( we use the natural unit such that @xmath4 throughout this manuscript ) : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are creation and annihilation operators for fermions labeled by the spin ( hyperfine state ) indices @xmath8 , respectively , and @xmath9 is the fermion dispersion @xmath10 shifted by the corresponding chemical potential .",

    "notice that as @xmath43 depends only on the magnitude of wave vector @xmath2 , the fourth order terms are crucial to determine the crystalline structures of the loff state  @xcite .",
    "however , when we getting very close to the phase transition line where the effective action is dominated by the leading quadratic term , it is sufficient to consider the coefficient @xmath43 , leading to @xmath44 \\nonumber   \\label{eqn : quadratic - coefficient } \\\\ & & \\hspace{1cm}-\\frac{\\mathcal{n}_{0}}{k_{f}a_{s}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the fermi distribution , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",

    "although our calculation results can not be directly compared with experiments , where the total particle number and polarization are observables instead of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - bcs-2 ] outline the general features of a finite temperature phase diagram in the bcs regime .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that a stable loff state may be present in harmonically trapped fermi gases with population imbalance , but only at low temperatures and in a small region of the trap .      as concluded in the previous discussion",
    ", the loff state becomes less favorable as one moves from the bcs regime to the unitarity .",
    "as one further increases the interaction strength , the same trend is kept in the bec regime , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - bec ] .",
    "although the finite scattering length @xmath19 sets an additional energy scale such that the phase diagrams are qualitatively different for various @xmath120 and @xmath107 , there are still some general features which can be concluded .",
    "first , similar to the unitarity case , a stable loff state is not present on the finite temperature phase diagrams in the bec regime .",
    "second , the structure of the bcs phase becomes simpler and contains less sub - regions . by moving from the unitarity towards the bec limit",
    ", the region with metastable loff state disappears first such that at the value of @xmath121 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - bec](a ) ] , only three regions are present in the bcs phase . by increasing the value of @xmath122 , the region where the normal state becomes unstable only due to loff instability [ region ( 2 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - bec](a ) ] disappears , such that the bcs phase becomes even simpler as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - bec](b ) .",
    "further towards the bec side , only a simple bcs superfluid state [ region ( 1 ) ] is present at the trap center , leading to a phase diagram similar to the unpolarized case [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : phase - bec](c ) ] . notice that for the parameters used in these plots , the breached pair state ( bp1 )  @xcite characterized by gapless fermionic excitations with a fermi surface is not present at zero temperature . at finite temperatures ,",
    "the boundary between bcs and bp1 is blurred and the crossover can not be clearly distinguished .",
    "we discuss in this manuscript the finite temperature phase diagrams of a trapped fermi gas with population imbalance , focusing on the existence and stability of the loff state .",
    "we first derive a ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory to study the second order normal - bcs and normal - loff phase transitions , where the order parameter is assumed to be small to ensure validity .",
    "furthermore , in order to determine the complete phase diagram , we adopt the mean - field approximation and directly minimize the resulting thermodynamic potential .",
    "this method allows us to distinguish the stable , the metastable , and the unstable saddle point phases from solutions of the order parameter equations .    using these methods , we are able to map out the finite - temperature phase diagrams over the bcs to bec region .",
    "we show that a stable loff state exists only on the bcs side of the feshbach resonance , but not at unitarity or in the bec regime .",
    "furthermore , we find that the loff state only exists at low temperatures within an appropriate region of population imbalance . with a global harmonic trap , even in the most optimal situation of all the parameters ,",
    "the loff state is only present in a small region of the trap . with the experimental limits on temperature and spatial resolution",
    ", we expect that it is very challenging to make a direct observation of a stable loff state in typical harmonic traps .",
