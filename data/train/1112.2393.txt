    "observations with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) have led to extraordinary progress in the knowledge of the variability properties of many different types of sources , particularly of black hole candidates ( bhcs ) and neutron stars ( nss ) in low - mass x - ray binaries ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "both bhcs and ns are known to exhibit distinct `` accretion states '' ( usually defined in terms of their x - ray spectral shape and variability ) , whose characteristics are thought to be intimately related to the physics of the accretion flow and its interaction with the central compact object ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    of all galactic bhc x - ray binaries known today ,",
    "one of the most prolific in terms of state transitions is grs  1915 + 105 . in outburst since its discovery in 1992 with watch @xcite , it is a 33 days orbital period binary system @xcite harboring a @xmath9 black hole @xcite . at a distance of @xmath10 kpc @xcite , grs  1915 + 105 is very often at eddington or super - eddington luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "grs  1915 + 105 is known to show quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the 0.00170 hz range , some of which are the same as those generally seen in other bhcs @xcite .",
    "however , so far grs  1915 + 105 has been unique in that its x - ray light curves exhibit more than a dozen different patterns of variability usually called `` classes '' ( which are referred to with greek letters ) , most of which are high amplitude and highly - structured ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most of this structured variability is thought to be due to limit cycles of accretion and ejection in an unstable disk ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) .",
    "much effort has been expended in order to understand why grs  1915 + 105 is so unusual among bhcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it has been proposed that the high accretion rate estimated for grs  1915 + 105 might be the determining factor ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) ; however , the lack of any other source showing similar characteristics has prevented definite conclusions .",
    "igr  j170913624 was discovered with integral / ibis during a galactic center observation on april 2003 @xcite and later again in 2007 @xcite .",
    "reexamination of archival data from different missions showed that igr  j170913624 was also active in 1994 , 1996 , 2001 @xcite .",
    "although a neutron star could not be excluded based on spectral characteristics and the outburst radio / x - ray flux ratio , @xcite concluded that igr  j170913624 is most probably a black hole .",
    "a new outburst was detected with _",
    "swift / bat _ in february 2011 @xcite ; the radio / x - ray characteristics during the first @xmath740 days , combined with the discovery of qpos @xcite , further suggested that igr  j170913624 is a black hole .",
    "recently we reported the discovery of 10 mhz qpos in rxte observations of igr  j170913624 @xcite very similar to those in grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "the suggested link between these sources was strengthened by our discovery of ( i ) a continuous progression of regular , quasi - periodic flares occurring at a rate of 2530 mhz @xcite , and ( ii ) a broad variety of complex patterns alternating with quiet intervals @xcite , resembling respectively , the so called @xmath1 class ( `` heartbeat '' ) oscillations and the complex @xmath4 class patterns , both so far seen only in grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "the existence of a source showing similar x - ray variability to that seen in grs  1915 + 105 opens a new window of opportunities to understand the physical mechanism that produces the highly structured x - ray variability .",
    "multi - wavelength and high spectral resolution studies of igr  j170913624 as compared with grs  1915 + 105 can help gaining further insights into the role of disc - jet coupling ( e.g. , review by * ? ? ? * ) and accretion disk winds ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in accreting bhcs .",
    "furthermore , it allows the possibility to test the role of the accretion disk size , evolutionary state of the companion star , and the evolution of the disc structure as an explanation of the long- and short - term x - ray variability seen in grs  1915 + 105 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this letter we use rxte data to describe the phenomenological similarities between igr  j170913624 and grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "we demonstrate that igr  j170913624 shows the same type of high amplitude and highly - structured variability previously observed only in grs  1915 + 105 , although at much lower count rates .",
    "the analysis presented here is the first step of a larger program to compare igr  j170913624 and grs  1915 + 105 in detail using data obtained with _ rxte _ , _ swift _ , _ xmm - newton _ as well as optical facilities .",

    "* ) on - board rxte almost daily since the outburst began in february 2011 ( at the time of submission of this letter , igr  j170913624 was still active ) .",
    "we use the first 147 observations , covering @xmath7180 days .",
    "we also used 1700 archival rxte observations of grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "power spectra and light curves were produced from the pca using standard techniques ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "deadtime corrected energy spectra averaged over each observation were created from pcu 2 data ; a systematic error of 1% was added to all channels .",
    "response matrices were created with pcarsp ( v11.7.1 ) using the position reported by @xcite , thereby taking into account a constant 0.4@xmath11 pointing offset used after february 23rd , 2011 ( mjd 55615 ) to avoid a bright nearby source ( see below ) .",
    "all spectra were satisfactorily fitted in the 3 - 25 kev band with an absorbed disk - blackbody plus power law model ( phabs*(diskbb + powerlaw ) ) using xspec 12 @xcite with @xmath12 fixed to @xmath13 @xmath14 @xcite ; some spectra required a gaussian at 6.5 kev for a good fit .",
    "figure  [ fig : outburstlc ] ( upper panel ) shows the swift / bat @xcite daily light curve of the first 200 days of the outburst ( assuming outburst onset on mjd @xmath755580 ) .",
    "the outburst reached a maximum of 0.026 counts/@xmath15/s ( 15 - 50 kev ) @xmath727 days after onset ; then decreased and remained below 0.01 counts/@xmath15/s .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : outburstlc ] shows the 2 - 20 kev , crab - normalized intensity and the 2 - 50 kev un - absorbed flux from each rxte / pca pointed observations .",
    "rxte observations started 21 days after onset .",
    "the first 10 observations ( until mjd 55615 ) are affected by the contribution of the bright , variable source gx  349 + 2 ( sco  x-2 ) which was within the 1@xmath11 pca fov ( see , also , * ? ? ?",

    ", we find that during mjd  5560155632 , the x - ray light curves were well characterized by broad band noise and a qpo moving in time from 0.1 hz up to @xmath76  hz . the evolution of the power spectral components ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) is similar to that seen in bhc transients in the hard state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , further suggesting the black hole nature of igr  j170913624 .    on mjd",
    "55634 igr  j170913624 first showed a @xmath710 mhz qpo .",
    "since then , a broad variety of complex patterns occurred , including strong variability in the form of flares alternating with quiet intervals @xcite .",
    "the variability shows remarkable similarities with that of grs  1915 + 105 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggesting a common mechanism . in figures  [ fig : complc1 ] and  [ fig : complc2 ] we show six different examples ; top and bottom frames of each panel correspond to data from igr  j170913624 and grs  1915 + 105 , respectively .",
    "based on the classification of @xcite , panel a shows segments of the @xmath0 class , and panels b and c two different varieties of @xmath1 class .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 variability classes in grs  1915 + 105 are characterized by quasi - periodic `` flares '' recurring on time scales between @xmath740 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath7120 seconds @xcite .",
    "the main differences between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 classes are that ( i ) the shape and period of the flares in @xmath0 can be more irregular than in @xmath1 and ( ii ) that the @xmath0 flares show a characteristic structure in their profiles , notably a dip followed by a secondary peak after the main one ( see figure  [ fig : complc1 ] ) .",
    "panel d shows segments of the @xmath2 class , in which `` rounded - bumps '' are sometimes accompanied by sharp peaks which last a few seconds .",
    "note that in our observations of igr  j170913624 we do not see the typical @xmath71000 s quiet interval which precedes the bumps in the @xmath2 class of grs  1915 + 105 ( not shown , see , e.g. , figure  19d in * ? ? ?",
    "panel e shows light curves from either the @xmath4 or the @xmath3 class .",
    "these light curves consist of quasi - periodic alternation of low - quiet periods with highly - variable and oscillating ones .",
    "panel f shows segments of the @xmath5 class , where we observe periods of very rapid ( factor of 2 - 4 changes in count rate in less than 5 seconds ) and almost incoherent variability .",
    "in addition to the light curves shown in figures  [ fig : complc1 ] and  [ fig : complc2 ] , igr  j170913624 displays complex light curves combining characteristics of different classes .",
    "it also shows _ quiet periods _ in which 1-sec light curves are flat ( @xmath16% fractional rms amplitude at @xmath17  hz ) .",
    "these periods are marked with grey shadowed areas in figure  [ fig : outburstlc ] and coincide with the times when igr  j17091 - 3624 is detected most strongly by _",
    "swift / bat _ , i.e. when the spectrum is hard . in terms of the grs  1915 + 105 variability classes",
    ", these periods could correspond to the @xmath6 class .",
    "figures  [ fig : complc1 ] and  [ fig : complc2 ] not only shows the remarkable similarities in the shapes of light curves from both sources , it also shows two clear differences : ( i ) the time scales can be different ( igr  j170913624 tends to be faster , see below ) and ( ii ) the average count rate ( or flux ) of the source can be much higher ( factor 10 - 50 ) in grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "some of the spectral and timing analysis performed for grs  1915 + 105 on time scales of seconds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is prevented by the combination of relatively low count rate and faster variability in igr  j170913624 .",
    "given that we find the @xmath0 and @xmath1 variability classes ( panels a - c ) in about 35% of our observations ( another @xmath735% of the light curves are flat , and the remaining @xmath730% are a mix of the @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath3 and unclassified ones ) and that @xmath1 is one of the best studied classes in grs  1915 + 105 , in the rest of this letter we constrain ourselves on further comparison of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 classes between sources .",
    "more detailed comparison of the other variability classes will be presented in upcoming papers .",
    "some of the observations clearly show only the @xmath1 or the @xmath0 types of flares , some show a mix and sometimes differentiating the two classes is difficult due to the low statistics . in any case",
    ", these flares can occur as fast as every few ( 2 - 5 ) seconds ( e.g. , obsid :  96420 - 01 - 22 - 04 , mjd  55768 ) , and as slow as every @xmath7100 seconds ( e.g. , obsid  96420 - 01 - 03 - 01 , mjd  55634 ) .",
    "this means that the oscillations in igr  j170913624 can be faster than those in grs  1915 + 105 , but not as slow .",
    "the fractional rms amplitude of the flares covers a range from @xmath72% to up to 50 - 60% . if one assumes that the minimum period that a quasi - periodic feature can reach scales proportional to some power of the mass of the compact object ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that a 2 - 5 s recurrence time of the @xmath1/@xmath0 flares igr  j170913624 versus @xmath740 s in grs  1915 + 105 is due to a difference in mass , then our results suggest the black hole in igr  j170913624 could be a factor of a few less massive than the @xmath9 of grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "the variability classes are known to exhibit distinctive spectral evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in a color - color diagram ( cd ) or hardness - intensity diagram ( hid )",
    ", one observes that each flare from the @xmath1 ( and sometimes @xmath0 ) class traces a loop ( or  ring  ,",
    "see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : looppds ] ( bottom - left ) shows the hid for ten consecutive flares from a single observation of grs  1915 + 105 ( inset shows a representative flare ) .",
    "the loop in the hid is always traversed clockwise .",
    "the hids and cds from _ single _ flares of igr  j170913624 are dominated by low statistics , so we could neither exclude nor confirm loop - like patterns similar to those observed in grs  1915 + 105 . to improve statistics , we used intervals where more than 10 flares occurred approximately periodically and folded each interval at the best average period .",
    "although this process washed out some of the structure in the light curves ( due to the quasi - periodicity of the signal and the profile differences between flares ) , all the hids we created using the same energy bands as in grs  1915 + 105 ( which are fixed by the observing modes used ) always showed a loop resembling that seen in grs  1915 + 105 . in the upper - left panel of figure  [ fig : looppds ]",
    "we show a representative example ( inset shows the average profile of the flare ) .",
    "however , in all cases the loop is traversed in an anti - clockwise sense , i.e. , opposite to what we see in grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "as the hardness ratios are a crude characterization of the spectrum , detailed spectral modeling of these loops ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are needed to understand whether there is a physical difference between the @xmath1 class seen in both sources .",
    "figure  [ fig : looppds ] ( right panels ) shows representative power spectra of the @xmath1 variability class in igr  j170913624 and grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "the power spectra share the same main features : ( i ) a low - frequency qpo ( with high harmonic content ) due to the `` flares '' and ( ii ) a qpo with characteristic frequency between 6 - 10 hz ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , for both sources we sometimes find a `` bump '' with characteristic frequency between 1 and 5 hz .",
    "an extensive literature exists attempting to understand the complex variability observed in grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "some authors propose that the high luminosity ( close to , or super - eddington ) of grs  1915 + 105 is the determining factor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "although it is generally accepted that the complex x - ray variability in grs  1915 + 105 results from disk instabilities , the exact nature of the instability remains unknown .",
    "the lack of at least a second source showing similar characteristics has prevented definite conclusions .    in this letter",
    "we show for the first time that another source , the bhc igr  j17091 - 3624 , can show the same broad variety of complex light curves as grs  1915 + 105 ( at least 7 of the 12 variability classes observed in grs  1915 + 105 , in addition to unclassified ones ; note that at the time of submission of this letter igr  j17091 - 3624 is still active ) .",
    "although the comparisons presented in this paper constitute only a first step , the observed similarities suggest that the complex light curves of the two sources are produced by the same physical mechanisms . if true , the low flux of igr  j17091 - 3624 compared with grs  1915 + 105 combined with the circumstance that currently neither the distance to igr  j17091 - 3624 nor the mass of its compact object are known , raises the fundamental question : is igr  j17091 - 3624 close to eddington or not at times when showing the same characteristic x - ray variability ?",
    "a scenario in which igr  j17091 - 3624 is not emitting at close to the eddington but only at a few percent , is at variance with models where the variability is explained as due to disk instabilities that _ only _ occur at high luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . however , in this scenario igr  j17091 - 3624 would follow radio / x - ray correlation of some or most bhcs ( depending if the distance is closer to @xmath18 kpc or @xmath19 kpc , respectively ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a scenario in which igr  j17091 - 3624 is emitting at close to the eddington limit puts constraints on its mass and distance .",
    "although this scenario would imply that , independently of the distance , igr  j17091 - 3624 does not follow the standard radio / x - ray luminosity plane for bhcs @xcite , this would be similar to grs  1915 + 105 , as it does not follow the radio / x - ray flux plane either ( see , e.g. , figure 4 in * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "we therefore made a rough estimate of the source flux in each observation by calculating the average - per - observation energy spectrum . in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : outburstlc ]",
    "we plot the 2 - 50 kev unabsorbed flux . in igr",
    "j17091 - 3624 we observe the @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 classes when the flux is between @xmath72 and @xmath73.7 @xmath20 erg  @xmath14  s@xmath21 ( the diskbb temperature kt vary between 1 and 2 kev while the power law index between 2 and 3 ) . assuming that igr  j17091 - 3624 is emitting at eddington rates , we derived the mass of the compact object as a function of distance ( figure  [ fig : edd ] ) for a 2 - 50 kev flux of @xmath22  erg  @xmath14  s@xmath21 . given that the correction factor linking the 2 - 50 kev and the bolometric flux is not exactly known , we plot curves for factors of 1 , 2 and 3 . figure  [ fig : edd ] implies that if igr  j17091 - 3624 emits at eddington , then either it harbors the lowest mass black hole known today ( @xmath23 for distances lower than 17 kpc ) , or , it is very distant .",
    "such a large distance , together with its @xmath242.2@xmath11 galactic latitude , would imply a significant , but not necessarily implausible , altitude above the disk ( e.g. , @xmath24 - 2.8@xmath11 and @xmath25kpc for the bhc gs  135464 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    clearly , constraining the distance to igr  j17091 - 3624 is fundamental for understanding the physical processes that govern the x - ray variability in igr  j17091 - 3624 , and hence those in grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "the interstellar absorption in the direction of igr  j17091 - 3624 is high ( @xmath26 @xmath14 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying that optical studies when the binary system is in quiescence ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) might be challenging .",
