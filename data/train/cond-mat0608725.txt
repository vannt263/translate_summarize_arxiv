    "there is an increasing interest in strongly correlated systems containing onedimensional ( 1d ) structures , both for their novel properties as well as for their possible applications .",
    "for example , chains and two - leg ladders are present in transition metal oxides and in organic conductors .",
    "other systems of increasing interest involving strongly correlated features are nanoscopic devices which have been recently fabricated and experimentally studied.@xcite in many of these devices , a droplet of electrons confined in the three spatial directions , the quantum dot ( qd ) , is connected to metallic leads . in this case",
    "the leads are described by tight - binding models , or in general by fermi liquids .",
    "the transport through such devices involve the formation of a kondo resonance in the qd .",
    "kondo physics is then relevant to understand this kind of devices .",
    "@xcite    it is also possible to connect the qd to conducting leads with electron correlations .",
    "this is the case of spin valves , one of the simplest devices used in spintronics,@xcite where a qd is attached to ferromagnetic leads .",
    "these leads can be built from materials such as manganese oxides @xcite or other compounds containing transition metal oxides such as vanadates.@xcite there have also been recent developments in producing devices where the leads are formed by carbon nanotubes ( although ultimately these leads are connected to metallic terminals ) which can be considered quasi - onedimensional and where electron correlations are presumably important.@xcite in fact , a luttinger liquid behavior , typical of correlated 1d systems , has been found in carbon nanotubes.@xcite    the problem of a magnetic impurity or qd in a correlated onedimensional system is then an interesting topic both for fundamental and for technological reasons . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the most important results for this kind of systems were obtained by considering a single impurity attached to leads described by luttinger liquids .",
    "much less is known when the leads are described by a hubbard model . in this case , this model has been treated by linearizing the dispersion relation and , using bosonization techniques , the long wavelength behavior is captured . within this approach , it was shown that in a system of a magnetic impurity connected to luttinger chains by a kondo exchange interaction @xmath1 , the kondo temperature acquires the power - law expression@xcite @xmath2 instead of the conventional exponential law for noninteracting chains .",
    "the luttinger exponent @xmath3 also determines the conductance through an interacting wire , which is given by @xmath4.@xcite    in this article we consider the even less studied problem of a single - impurity anderson - hubbard hamiltonian on finite - size systems . our aim is to provide a detailed microscopic picture of the competition between the electron correlations on the impurity and the ones on the leads , and to understand the role of finite length of the chains .",
    "although the lengths considered in this study are still smaller than the physical length of current devices , the study on finite - size systems are interesting per se .",
    "in fact , it has been suggested that the kondo temperature can be very different in finite chains with respect to the one in infinite leads.@xcite it is also expected that the size of nanoelectronic devices will be further reduced in the near future .",
    "the fundamental problem of the competition between the kondo effect and the luttinger liquid starting from a microscopic hamiltonian was recently studied on infinite systems using an approximated analytical renormalization group technique.@xcite the problem of an anderson impurity in a @xmath5 model has been also addressed within the bethe _ ansatz _",
    "formalism.@xcite    although manganese oxides should be described by a generalized ferromagnetic kondo - lattice model@xcite , and vanadates or carbon nanotubes by some variants of the hubbard or @xmath5 models on ladders@xcite , in order to get an insight on the physical behavior , it is necessary to consider first the simpler case of leads described by a 1d hubbard model .",
    "of course , some of the results obtained are relevant to magnetic impurities in strongly correlated quasi-1d compounds such as those mentioned at the beginning .",
    "results for ldos for example , could be compared with those obtained by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments.@xcite    numerical techniques are ideally suited to cope with finite systems . in particular",
    "we mainly employ the dmrg technique,@xcite which provides essentially exact results for various real - space properties on finite chains .",
    "these real - space properties of real - space models can shed light on the functioning of qd devices.@xcite in this sense , in this work we will determine the way in which the kondo effect is affected by varying the electron density or the hubbard repulsion on the leads by computing the electron occupation and the square of the @xmath6-component of the spin at the impurity site .",
    "more importantly , from the spin - spin correlation functions we will study the  spin compensation cloud \" , a possible measure of the more elusive kondo screening cloud.@xcite using this technique , it has been shown that the screening cloud is reduced by electron correlations on the leads in a system with two kondo impurities.@xcite we will extend this approach to the anderson impurity where we will make a careful study of finite - size effects .",
    "dmrg results for the spin compensation cloud have been reproduced to a good approximation by using a recently developed quantum monte carlo technique@xcite .",
    "this technique also allows us to study this quantity at finite temperature .    in order to study transport properties",
    ", we will study the ldos at the impurity , which is related to the conductance in an essential way . by implementing some recent developments in dmrg@xcite",
    ", we will compute the conductance as the response of the system to a finite but small voltage bias applied to the leads .",
    "we will examine this property as the hubbard repulsion @xmath7 is varied .",
    "we will also show that the effect of this variation on both the ldos at the impurity and the conductance , depend in turn on the values of the electron interactions on the impurity .",
    "we will explore various types of impurities , from the mixed valence to kondo regimes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we describe the model studied and we provide details of the numerical techniques employed . in section [ varying_density ]",
    "we study the effect of reducing the electron density from half - filling to quarter - filling for the case of noninteracting ( tight - binding ) leads . in section [ varying_u ] ,",
    "we analyze how the kondo effect varies with the hubbard repulsion @xmath7 on the leads at quarter - filling .",
    "finally , the relation between the results obtained and those in the previous literature , and the relevance of the present study to real systems or nanoscopic devices , are discussed in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this paper we use the terms  impurity \" and qd indistinctly , and we refer to the remainder sites of the chain as the  leads \" .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional single - impurity anderson - hubbard model defined by the hamiltonian : @xmath8 where conventional notation was used .",
    "the first two terms correspond to the left lead and the following two terms to the right lead .",
    "the next term is the impurity - lead interaction , and the last two terms are the on - site energy and hubbard repulsion at the impurity site , located at site @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "we adopt @xmath10 as the scale of energy . in the case of @xmath0 ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) reduces to the single - impurity anderson model , and for @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , to the hubbard model .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) will be studied mostly using the numerical technique dmrg@xcite on finite - size clusters of length @xmath14 with open boundary conditions ( obc ) .",
    "this algorithm provides numerically exact results for static properties at zero temperature with a precision which depends on the number @xmath15 of states retained .",
    "most of the results here reported were obtained for @xmath16 , except otherwise stated , asserting us that the integrated weight of discarded states are of order @xmath17 in the worst case . on the other hand , results for dynamical properties , such as ldos ,",
    "should be taken qualitatively , as discussed below .",
    "the same apply to the results obtained for the time evolution of the current on the links connecting the impurity with the leads . in order to assess even - odd effects most of the results reported below",
    "were obtained by using even and odd chain lengths . throughout all this paper ,",
    "dmrg calculations will be done in the subspace of total @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) for @xmath14 even ( odd ) .",
    "the qd is located in one of two central sites of the chain when @xmath14 is even ( in the central site when @xmath14 is odd ) .",
    "we have computed static properties such as the electron occupancy on each site , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and spin - spin correlations from the qd , @xmath22 .",
    "a very important quantity related to the kondo effect is the kondo screening length , which is somewhat elusive to compute.@xcite a possible measure of this kondo length is the length of the  spin compensation cloud\"@xcite defined as the length @xmath23 such that @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an arbitrary parameter . in the following we adopt a fixed value @xmath26 in order to compare @xmath23 for the different cases .",
    "one of the main quantities we have studied is the local density of states , @xmath27 , at the qd . in the first place , from this quantity it would be possible to evaluate the conductance in the linear response regime (",
    "see below ) . in the second place , recent advances in stm",
    "have made it possible to directly measure this quantity . since in our dmrg calculation the measurements",
    "are performed when the two added sites are at the center of the chain ( symmetrical configuration ) , the qd then is one of these two sites which are exactly treated .",
    "then , we adopt the approximation of applying the creation and annihilation operators at the qd on the ground state vector and then determine @xmath27 following the well - known continued fraction formalism",
    ". a more accurate approach would be , after the application of each of those creation and annihilation operators , to run additional sweeps for an enlarged density matrix.@xcite in any case , the truncation of the hilbert space is the essential source of error in dmrg , and to estimate the precision of our approach we have compared results for various numbers of retained states @xmath15 , from @xmath28 to 600 .",
    "we would also like to stress the fact that the conductance in linear response is related to the ldos near @xmath29 where the approximation is more precise .",
    "our calculation starts to be less precise as we move away from the chemical potential , since then higher excited states are involved .    for this kind of systems , specially in connection to nanoscopic devices ,",
    "the most interesting properties are those related to transport , in particular , the conductance @xmath30 .",
    "when the chains or leads are described by a tight - binding model , or in general by a fermi liquid , various expressions relating it to the ldos at the impurity are available in linear response , as mentioned before . in addition",
    ", the friedel s sum rule ( see eq . ( [ gfriedel ] ) below ) allows a simple and precise calculation of @xmath30 , particularly for numerical techniques . in the case of hubbard chains , or in general luttinger liquid leads , one must resort to the expression , in linear response,@xcite @xmath31 where the current is defined as @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the ground state of the system at time @xmath10 .",
    "although such a calculation can be carried out within dmrg , some recent developments collectively known as time - dependent dmrg@xcite allow to compute directly @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "the time - evolution is triggered by the application of a bias voltage @xmath36 between the left and right leads at @xmath37.@xcite that is , at time @xmath37 , a potential @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) on the sites on the left ( right ) leads is switched on .",
    "then , charge moves from one lead to the other in a non - equilibrium process .",
    "this non - equilibrium process was studied analytically in ref . .",
    "in finite size systems , @xmath34 follows an oscillatory evolution as charge is bounced between the left and right leads . as the length of the leads",
    "are extended to infinity , the period of this oscillation becomes infinitely long ( the leads become infinite charge reservoirs ) and the usual concept of conductance is recovered . it was shown in refs . that even for moderate size clusters , on each period , @xmath34 reaches a plateau that corresponds to the value of the bulk limit .",
    "hence a measure of the conductance can be obtained as the value of this plateau or the amplitude of this oscillation , that is : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) is the current on the link connecting the impurity site with the left ( right ) lead .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ condjt ] ) is valid for an arbitrary finite bias @xmath36 .",
    "the evolution of the ground state @xmath44 from @xmath10 to @xmath45 is computed with a _",
    "static _ runge - kutta treatment of the time - dependent schrdinger equation.@xcite again in this case , a much precise calculation could be performed by including @xmath44 at intermediate times @xmath46 as targeted states in the density matrix and by running additional sweeps.@xcite this approach is of course much more expensive computationally .    in the calculations reported below we adopted a bias @xmath47 and a time step @xmath48 .",
    "finally , we report finite temperature results obtained with quantum monte carlo simulations using the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) algorithm.@xcite in this case , we consider chains with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "the use of pbc helps to assess the effects of the friedel oscillations which appear with obc , used with dmrg , but are absent with pbc .",
    "sse with the loop upgrade is a very efficient qmc algorithm which allows to reach much lower temperatures and larger sizes than other qmc algorithms .",
    "it also avoids the problem of extrapolation of the trotter dimension common in  world - line \" algorithms .",
    "it is also worth to note that sse works in the grand canonical ensemble , i.e. , the chemical potential has to be tuned to give a desired density _ on average_. notice that the  minus sign problem \" which affects quantum monte carlo simulations for fermionic models is absent in 1d with hopping between nearest neighbor sites only since fermion permutations appear just as a boundary effect .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to study the effects of correlations on the leads .",
    "this study will be performed in the next section .",
    "most theoretical studies on kondo effect have considered the half - filled case ( @xmath49 ) , where the system is particle - hole symmetric .",
    "now , since an infinitesimal value of @xmath7 drives the system into an insulating state , in order to keep the leads metallic in the presence of correlations it is necessary to study the system away from half - filling . in section [ varying_u ]",
    "we will work at quarter - filling ( @xmath50 ) . in this section , as a preliminary step , we study the evolution of the kondo effect as the filling is reduced from @xmath49 to @xmath50 in the absence of interactions on the lead ( @xmath0 ) . in particular we are interested in following the evolution of what at half - filling is the kondo resonance , as the electron density decreases .",
    "model eq.([hamilt ] ) , which as stated above reduces to the single - impurity anderson model , was studied by dmrg for several @xmath14 up to 96 sites , and for fillings @xmath49 , 0.875 , 0.75 , 0.625 and 0.5 .",
    "since , as we said in the introduction , there is a competition between the correlations on the leads and the correlations at the impurity or qd , we consider four sets of interactions on the impurity : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . in all cases",
    "we consider the symmetric case , @xmath55 .",
    "for these sets of parameters , the effective kondo coupling @xmath56 takes the values 0.125 , 0.5 , 0.25 , and 0.5 respectively , although strictly this relationship is only valid for @xmath57 , and hence not much applicable to the last case . in spite of sharing the same @xmath58 ,",
    "the second and fourth sets behave quite differently as we will show below .     at the impurity site as a function of the filling for @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( circles ) , @xmath59 , @xmath61 ( squares ) , @xmath62 , @xmath60 ( diamonds ) and @xmath63 , @xmath60 ( triangles ) .",
    "@xmath64,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    let us start by examining the dependence of the electron occupancy @xmath65 and @xmath66 at the impurity site with the electron density .",
    "this variation depends in turn strongly on the interactions at the impurity as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . if @xmath67 , @xmath68 takes its maximum value ( 1/4 ) when the impurity is a perfect spin-1/2 , corresponding to the full kondo regime . in the mixed valence regime",
    ", it takes the value 1/12 . for the parameter set @xmath51 , the system is in a well defined kondo regime , and",
    "the dependence with @xmath69 is relatively weak . on the opposite case , for @xmath54",
    "the system is not in a well - defined kondo regime at half - filling , and the dependence with the electron filling is stronger .",
    "the reduction of electron density drives the system into the mixed valence regime .",
    "notice that in this second case , the occupancy of the impurity is smaller than @xmath69 . besides , it is well known that there are friedel oscillations in @xmath70 beginning at the ends of the chains with obc.@xcite it is then valid to ask if these oscillations could have some effect on the electron occupancy at the impurity . in the present case , any important influence of the friedel oscillations on the impurity properties",
    "can be ruled out because the results for @xmath64 are virtually identical within error bars to those obtained with sse and using pbc where these oscillations are absent , at the lowest temperatures we considered .",
    "of course , the presence of the impurity induces other density oscillations which overimpose to the friedel oscillations induced by the open ends .",
    "in fact we have observed in some cases that the presence of the impurity changes the period of the open end oscillations from @xmath71 to @xmath72 .",

    "in summary , we have studied the single - impurity anderson - hubbard model on finite chains with numerical techniques . in the first place",
    ", we analyzed how the reduction of the electron density from half - filling to quarter - filling affects the kondo resonance for non - interacting leads .",
    "physical quantities defining the magnetic character of the impurity show in general a weak behavior with the electron density except when the impurity is , at half - filling , close to a mixed valence regime . in this case",
    "there is a steep lost of magnetic character by reducing the density .",
    "this behavior is reflected also in the impurity ldos and in the conductance in linear response .",
    "next , we turn to the main topic of this work which is the study of the effects of a hubbard interaction on the leads at quarter - filling .",
    "a very clear and interesting result is that @xmath7 drives the impurity into a more defined kondo regime ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) although accompanied in most cases by a reduction of the spectral weight of the impurity ldos .",
    "this reduction is however not general since for an impurity close to the mixed valence regime we observed a nonmonotonic behavior . as we mentioned in the introduction",
    ", there is a number of strongly correlated materials which can be or have already been implemented@xcite in nanoscopic devices and where some of the present results for the impurity ldos could be contrasted .",
    "the conductance , computed for a small finite bias applied to the leads , follows the behavior of the impurity ldos . for",
    "the impurities in a well - defined kondo regime , the conductance is suppressed by @xmath7 in finite chains , in agreement with what is expected for an impurity in a luttinger liquid .",
    "again , for the impurity close to a mixed valence regime , @xmath30 increases for small @xmath7 but eventually starts to decrease for large values of @xmath7 .",
    "this nonmonotonic behavior indicates a complex interplay between the interactions on the impurity and the ones on the leads ( in addition , of course , to the impurity - leads interactions ) .",
    "finally , we exploit one of the important advantages of the real space methods we used , that is , the possibility of getting a measure of the spin screening or compensation of the impurity .",
    "the  spin compensation cloud \" gives an insight on the internal working of the kondo effect and it does not depend just on properties at the impurity site but also on @xmath7 on the leads . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , finite - size effects are more important for small values if @xmath7 . the proposed determination of the kondo temperature in finite systems through the spin compensation cloud , has to be thoroughly explored as a function of density and coupling parameters . we emphasize that this numerical estimation of @xmath130 is completely general in the sense that it is not limited to 1d anderson - hubbard model but could be used for any hamiltonian for the leads , for example the kondo lattice model , and also not limited to 1d leads , although beyond 1d the  minus sign problem \" makes difficult the application of qmc methods .",
    "moreover , we believe that the dependence of @xmath130 with the finite size of the system could be experimentally measured and compared with theoretical results .",
