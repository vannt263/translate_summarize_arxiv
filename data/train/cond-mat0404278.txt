    "during the last two decades there has been an upsurge of interest for the physical mechanisms which control the behavior of granular media , i.e. systems consisting of a large number of macroscopic grains , such as sand , cereals , powders , etc  @xcite these materials play an important role in many industrial and technological processes and in natural phenomena and their handling has developed into a multi - billion - dollar industry .",
    "much experimental and theoretical effort has been spent on understanding their behavior under a variety of conditions . among the most frequently studied systems",
    "are the so called granular gases  @xcite , obtained by subjecting to an external driving force an assembly of grains , so that their behavior resembles that of a molecular gas . however",
    ", important differences between the micro - world and the macro - world , i.e. between the atomic scale and the millimeter scale , render the analogy incomplete , so that one can not infer their properties from the knowledge of the molecular level .",
    "this irreducibility stems chiefly from the presence of non conserving forces .",
    "striking manifestations of the peculiarity of granular gases are the non maxwellian velocity distributions , the shear instability , the cluster formation to mention just a few .",
    "a typical experiment aimed to probe the behavior of granular gases consists of a vertical container partially filled with spherical particles which are accelerated by a vertically vibrating base  @xcite .",
    "the competition between the dissipation of kinetic energy , due to inelastic collisions between the grains , and the energy provided by the external driving force may lead the system to exhibit a variety of non - equilibrium statistically steady states .",
    "the phenomenology resulting from such a simple experimental setup is incredibly rich and by no means trivial . in addition , by varying the control parameters , such as the number of particles , the driving frequency and amplitude , the container aspect - ratio , one can observe the crossover from one dynamical phase to another .",
    "the exploration of the resulting phase diagram has been conducted by means of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations .",
    "several properties have also been obtained by granular hydrodynamics and kinetic theory . however , such calculations are difficult as the walls and the moving base of the container together with the gravitational field break the translational invariance of the system . as a result , one observes density and temperature gradients which render the theoretical analysis highly non trivial .",
    "in addition , the description of the boundary layers is out of the range of applicability of hydrodynamics .    in the present work",
    "we shall focus on the thermal convection instability in granular systems  @xcite , which consists in the appearance of convection rolls due to the competition between temperature gradients and gravity .",
    "it appears to be different from standard convection , which is induced by boundaries and excluded volume effects  @xcite .",
    "thermal convection in granular media has been first observed in 2d simulations  @xcite , confirmed by 3d experiments  @xcite and analytically investigated in  @xcite .",
    "some numerical investigations can also be found in  @xcite .",
    "the underlying mechanism is analogous to rayleigh - bnard convection in classical fluids  @xcite , with the remarkable difference that in a vibrofluidized granular medium the required temperature gradient sets in spontaneously as a consequence of the interplay between the collisional dissipation of energy in the bulk of the granular gas and of the power injected by the vibrating base .",
    "hereafter , we shall consider the onset of convective rolls in mono and bi - disperse two - dimensional vibrated granular gases and its similarity with the corresponding phenomenon in ordinary fluids .",
    "in particular we shall investigate , by means of event - driven molecular dynamics simulations , a series of predictions provided by the linear stability analysis of hydrodynamic equations  @xcite for pure granular materials .",
    "we shall address the limits of very low and very high intensity of the gravity .",
    "in addition , we shall explore the effects of polydispersity on thermal convection , studying a binary mixture of granular gases  @xcite with different mechanical properties ( in particular different coefficients of restitution ) .",
    "we shall characterize the standard hydrodynamic fields , namely velocity , density and temperature , both in the presence and in the absence of convective rolls .    in section",
    "ii we define the model employed to simulate the grains in the vibrated container , discuss the relevant dimensionless control parameter and recall the hydrodynamic predictions . in section iii",
    "we investigate the pure system and propose a qualitative comparison with the hydrodynamic predictions  @xcite at high and low intensity of the gravity . in section",
    "iv we study the binary mixture case , measuring velocity , density , and temperature fields . in section",
    "v we study the effect of gradually adding a quasi - elastic component to a mono - disperse system composed of inelastic disks . we observe a sharp transition between a convective and a non convective regime . finally in section",
    "vi we present a brief discussion and the conclusions .",
    "let us consider an assembly of grains constrained to move on a vertical rectangular domain , representing the container , of dimensions @xmath0 , and subjected to a gravitational force acting along the negative @xmath1 direction .",
    "the grains are idealized as inelastic hard disks of diameter @xmath2 and are fluidized by the movement of the base , which oscillates with frequency @xmath3 and amplitude @xmath4 .",
    "the collisions of the particles with the side and top walls conserve their kinetic energy since the latter are immobile , smooth and perfectly elastic . instead",
    ", the collisions between grains are inelastic , and will be represented by means of non constant coefficients of restitution , @xmath5 , which are functions of the pre - collisional relative velocity along the direction joining the centers of a pair , @xmath6 , according to the formula :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 indicate the species of the colliding particles , @xmath10 are constants related to the three types of colliding pairs , @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the gravitational acceleration . at large relative velocities",
    "the functions @xmath5 assume constant values @xmath10 , representing the coefficients of restitution , but tend to the elastic value @xmath13 for collisions occurring with vanishing relative velocity .",
    "we have checked the insensitivity of our results on the choice of the value of @xmath14 . the use of velocity dependent coefficients of restitution has the merit of avoiding anomalous sequences of collisions among `` collapsed '' particles @xcite .",
    "all the lengths are measured in terms of @xmath2 .",
    "the full dynamics consists of a succession of free streaming trajectories , which in the presence of the gravitational field have parabolic shapes , and inter - particle collisions or wall - particle collisions .",
    "it is therefore very convenient to employ the event driven molecular dynamics .",
    "we used the same simulation code of reference  @xcite .",
    "the domain was divided into cells and in each cell time - averaged quantities where computed in order to measure the hydrodynamic fields .",
    "in such a coarse - grained description we studied the density , @xmath15 , and velocity field , @xmath16 .",
    "the local fluctuation of the velocity defines the granular temperature in the cell @xmath17 centered around the point of coordinates ( @xmath18 ) :    @xmath19 where the symbol @xmath20 is an average performed in the cell @xmath17 . in the measurement procedure we discarded an initial transient and focused on steady state properties .    from the analysis of the time",
    "averaged velocity field we identified the convection rolls without ambiguity by measuring the circulation , @xmath21 , of the velocity field  @xcite : @xmath22    the value of @xmath21 is obtained , in a steady state , by calculating the sum of the integrals along @xmath23 different circular paths @xmath24 of radius @xmath25 and of length @xmath26 around the center of the box .",
    "the circulation vanishes in the absence of convection or in the presence of an even number of convection rolls , and is finite for an odd - number of rolls .    to characterize the dynamical states of the system , it is convenient to introduce three relevant dimensionless parameters  @xcite .",
    "the first parameter is the froude number , which quantifies the relative importance of the potential energy due to the gravity with respect to the energy input at the base . in many previous numerical studies",
    "@xcite , the base is `` thermal '' : a particle colliding with the base is reinjected with a velocity taken from a gaussian distribution of given temperature @xmath27 , and thus the froude number is given by @xmath28 .",
    "in hydrodynamical studies  @xcite , the temperature at the base , @xmath29 , is a boundary condition and @xmath30 . in our model",
    ", the base is really vibrating , and the energy received on average by a colliding particle is @xmath31 , so that we can choose as definition for @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the maximum height reached by a projectile launched vertically with initial velocity @xmath35 .",
    "it is worth to comment that @xmath32 is employed in the present analysis instead of @xmath36 , which represents the ratio between the acceleration transmitted by the vibrating wall and the gravitational acceleration . in the case of a vibrating base ,",
    "we note that , in contrast with the less realistic case of a thermal wall  @xcite which has been used in previous simulations , the mass of the particles does not appear in the definition of the froude number ; this is a relevant point when studying mixtures since different masses do not lead to different froude numbers . moreover , the presence of a realistic vibrating wall , instead of a stochastic hot wall ( which are not equivalent , see e.g. @xcite ) , represents a more severe test of the conjectured convective scenario .",
    "in particular , one can answer the question whether the movement of the base breaks the structures and the correlations and renders the convective rolls unstable .    the second dimensionless parameter relevant for the problem , the knudsen number  @xcite @xmath37 is related to the mean free path and @xmath38 is the number of filled layers at rest . finally , in the case of pure ( monodisperse ) systems , we consider the dissipative parameter @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a measure of the inelasticity of the system and @xmath41 is the coefficient of restitution .",
    "@xmath25 depends both on the inelasticity and on the collision rate , since @xmath42 if either @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "it is useful to recall the hydrodynamic predictions concerning the phase behavior of the system . in",
    "@xcite it has presented the following phase diagram ( see figure  [ diagram ] ) : at fixed @xmath32 and @xmath45 , convection rolls appear with increasing inelasticity , i.e. if @xmath25 overcomes a critical value @xmath46 .",
    "such a value , @xmath46 , is an increasing function of the knudsen number , @xmath45 , which in turn decreases with the number of particles present in the system . with respect to the froude number ,",
    "instead @xmath46 is a non - monotonic function of @xmath32 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ diagram ] , at low @xmath32 ( i.e. at low gravity or strong shaking ) @xmath46 first decreases , i.e. convection is easier to obtain as the gravity increases .",
    "@xmath46 however reaches a minimum and then _ increases _ as the gravity is further increased .",
    "in the next section we show the main results of numerical simulations , observing good _ qualitative _ agreement with predictions from hydrodynamics ; however , since vibrating and thermal walls can yield different behavior for the same value of the parameters  @xcite , no quantitative test will be made .",
    ", at fixes @xmath45 , showing the predictions of hydrodynamic theories  @xcite .",
    "convection is expected increasing @xmath25 , e.g. decreasing the restitution coefficient @xmath41 , as well as changing @xmath32 in an adequate interval . at too low or too high values of @xmath32 ( e.g. very low or very high gravity )",
    "the system does not reach convection .",
    "the two dashed lines indicate the paths followed in the numerical simulations to verify the predictions .",
    "path a corresponds to figure  [ fig_puro_r ] , path b to figure  [ fig_puro_fr].,height=226 ]    we begin by exploring the phase diagram sketched in figure  [ diagram ] , obtained from the theory  @xcite , along a plane where @xmath45 is constant and moving along two different paths : a line with constant @xmath32 ( path a ) and a line with constant @xmath25 ( path b ) , respectively .",
    "along path a the effect of increasing @xmath25 ( i.e. of decreasing coefficient of restitution ) is to enhance correlations in the system and render steeper and steeper the temperature profile in the vertical direction  @xcite .",
    "this leads to the onset of convection and eventually to the increase of the number of convection rolls . in figure  [ fig_puro_r ]",
    "we display three pictures corresponding to three different values of @xmath25 . at @xmath47 one",
    "observes the absence of convection , whereas a single roll appears at @xmath48 .",
    "finally two rolls are observed for @xmath49 .",
    "the low values of @xmath32 ( low gravity ) and @xmath45 ( low density ) allow the particles to explore the whole box , i.e. regions far from the bottom as well as regions near the base .",
    "figure  [ fig_puro_r_circ ] , displays the evolution of the velocity field circulation during the transient and the stationary regimes in the case of @xmath49 : we see that the system first evolves forming a single convection roll before reaching the stationary state characterized by the presence of two rolls . from fig  [ fig_puro_r_circ ]",
    "we observe that the formation of a roll occurs sharply .    in figure  [ fig_puro_order ]",
    "is shown the circulation ( defined in eq .  )",
    "averaged on times between @xmath50 and @xmath51 and calculated for different restitution coefficients , between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this picture illustrates the presence of two transitions , as the restitution coefficient is reduced : there appears to be a continuous transition from absence of convection to one convection roll and a discontinuous transition from one roll to two rolls .",
    "this second transition shows hysteresis : the solid line is obtained performing simulations with an increasing restitution coefficient , i.e. decreasing @xmath25 , and initializing each run with the last configuration of the previous run .",
    "the dashed line is instead obtained decreasing the restitution coefficient ( increasing @xmath25 ) .",
    "the transition point changes between the two procedures . as a matter of fact",
    "there is a window of values of @xmath25 where the system may evolve to one or two rolls , depending on initial conditions .",

    "therefore , lowering the intensity of gravity ( e.g. inclining the box ) reduces such a competition and the value of @xmath46 at which thermal convection can be observed increases . on the other side ,",
    "when @xmath32 ( i.e. gravity ) exceeds a certain threshold , there is a crossover to a substantially different regime : the grains tend to remain localized near the vibrating plate .",

    "in such a case the typical length - scale characterizing the onset of convection suggests the presence of a multi - roll configuration . in figure  [ fig_highfr ]",
    "we display the velocity field of a system with large aspect ratio @xmath81 and a very high froude number , @xmath82 . in this regime ,",
    "almost no collisions with the upper wall occur , and @xmath76 is therefore essentially irrelevant",
    ". remarkably , five convection rolls are present and a wave - like horizontal profile of the density is observed , revealing a horizontal density instability ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "note that an odd number of rolls can only be obtained with fixed walls boundary conditions , while periodic boundary conditions lead always to an even number of rolls , because neighboring cells must rotate in opposite directions .    in order to complete our description of the hydrodynamic properties of the system",
    ", we have analyzed the granular temperature and density fields shown in figure  [ fig_highfr_fields ] ( in the case of fixed lateral walls ) .",
    "both fields show clearly the horizontal inhomogeneity : the density instability and the corresponding temperature instability can be explained in terms of the peculiar clustering mechanism characterizing granular fluids .",
    "inelastic collisions , which occur more frequently in dense regions , determine a reduction of the local temperature and consequently a drop of the local pressure .",
    "the ensuing pressure gradient amplifies the density fluctuation and more particles flow toward that region .",
    "note that the three regions , where the density is larger , are located in correspondence of the three `` valleys '' at the free surface visible in figure  [ fig_highfr ] .",
    "the temperature field reflects the symmetries of the density field , and one can see that density and temperature are anti - correlated : the denser regions are colder .",
    "for instance , the three `` islands '' of hot particles correspond to the three lower densities ( i.e. the holes left empty by the depression of the free surface , see again figure  [ fig_highfr ] ) .",
    "however , above a certain height ( about @xmath83 ) , the horizontal instability disappears and both temperature and density decrease together : this is a region with very low number of particles .",
    "direct comparison between figures  [ fig_highfr ] and [ fig_highfr_fields ] clearly shows the strong correlation between the velocity field and the temperature and density fields .",
    "in the region separating two convective rolls , two opposite phenomena can be observed : ( i ) if the velocity field is directed upward , i.e. toward the free surface , the density is relatively low and one observes a bump on the surface ; ( ii ) if the velocity field is directed downward , the bottom plate confines the particles and one observes both a depression in the surface and a high density region close to the bottom . each convection roll therefore displays an asymmetric shape with a high - density region coupled to the downward flow and a low - density region coupled to the upward flow .",
    "we notice that this phenomenology is slightly different from that observed in  @xcite , where a convective regime and a clustering regimes where studied separately : our simulations indicate a strong interplay between density and velocity fields .",
    "in the present section , we shall consider how the convective properties of a granular fluid can be modified by the addition of a second species with different physical properties .",
    "first , we shall trigger the convection by tuning the parameters of one of the two species , in the case of equal concentrations .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=204 ]    while non - equipartition can be determined by differences either of masses , sizes or inelasticities , we have mentioned in the introduction that the froude number does not depend on the masses of the particles when the energy is injected through a vibrating wall .",
    "we shall therefore focus on mixtures of beads with different inelasticities or sizes .",
    "we shall begin with a mixture consisting of two kinds of grains with different coefficients of restitution .",
    "we denote with @xmath96 the coefficient of restitution relative to collisions among particles both belonging to species @xmath84 , @xmath91 relative to collisions between particles of species @xmath85 and @xmath97 relative to collisions between unlike species . for the sake of simplicity , we shall assume @xmath98 .",
    "figure  [ fig_r11 ] shows how the variation of the inelasticity of only one of the two species may change the convective structure : in particular we reduce @xmath91 keeping @xmath96 fixed .",
    "the species @xmath84 has a restitution coefficient @xmath88 equal to the case of figure  [ fig_puro_r ] , which displayed a single convection roll . in a first simulation ( left frame ) the species @xmath85 has a restitution coefficient @xmath99 , and still a single convection roll is observed . in a second simulation , with @xmath100 ,",
    "two convection rolls are found . in the same figure we also display two corresponding snapshots , in order to give a hint of the coupling between the rolls and the density : as in the previous section , regions of high density are coupled to the downward flow of particles .",
    "moreover the snapshots suggest the absence of segregation , as expected for dilute systems .",
    "the absence of segregation and the visual inspection of convection rolls suggest a first simple hypothesis for the behavior of a binary mixture with different restitution coefficients : an equimolar mixture behaves similarly to a pure gas with an effective restitution coefficient that is roughly an average between those of the two components .",
    "in fact in the first case the `` average '' restitution coefficient is still near the value where a single cell was observed in the pure gas , while in the second case this effective coefficient ( around @xmath101 ) is similar to the one corresponding to two rolls in the pure gas ( rightmost frame of figure  [ fig_puro_r ] ) .    as far as the temperature ratio field @xmath102",
    "is concerned , we can not present a conclusive picture .",
    "in fact , the temperature ratio profiles that can be efficiently measured in situations where the systems are horizontally homogeneous ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) become extremely noisy due to the presence of transversal structures and convection .",
    "our results suggest that the temperature ratio is not appreciably affected by convection rolls or at least the variation with respect to the case without rolls can not be resolved due to the statistical uncertainty .",
    "we recall that in granular gases the breakdown of equipartition is not necessarily related to segregation and can be predicted on the basis of the homogeneous boltzmann equation for dissipative hard spheres ( or disks ) , both in the absence and in the presence of external driving forces .     not far from @xmath84 ) shows differences in the convective pattern , with respect of figure  [ fig_highfr ] .",
    "the parameters are the same used for that figure . in this plot",
    "the value @xmath70 used to normalize the arrows is @xmath103 cm / sec .",
    ", height=188 ]    finally , we have studied how to enhance segregation of a mixture , in a case where the global density was higher and the sizes of the particles where different . in particular , we have chosen the parameters corresponding to figure  [ fig_highfr ] , but substituted half of the grains with grains having larger diameter ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "the velocity field is shown in figure  [ fig_highfr_mix ] .",
    "the field is averaged over very long times , i.e. few hundreds of oscillations of the plate , and the horizontal asymmetry observed appears to be stationary , although , in principle , this pattern is expected to be metastable , in the sense that an infinitely long average should produce a horizontally periodic field .",
    "therefore , a slight change in the size of half of the particles affects the convective field leaving unaltered the number of rolls , but changing their relative size and shape .",
    "we have analyzed the density fields of the single species @xmath105 and @xmath106 and the density ratio @xmath107 , obtaining the results in figure  [ fig_highfr_mix_fields ] .",
    "segregation is now evident , appearing as deviations of @xmath108 from @xmath84 .",
    "in particular it can be noted that at the bottom there are more particles of species @xmath84 ( the larger particles ) .",
    "this results calls for new experiments in this dilute `` granular gas '' regime : in fact it is opposite to well known experimental findings in the densely packed regime  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it appears that stronger segregation is localized in regions of high density .",
    "even in a granular mixture the relative concentration , @xmath109 , is expected to play an important role .",
    "not only it affects the ratio of the partial granular temperatures , but also can induce a transition from a homogeneous to a convective velocity regime .",
    "this has particular relevance , for instance , in industrial processes that require the absence or the presence of convection : in the simulations of this section we show how a small percentage of `` doping '' quasi - elastic particles added to an assembly of more inelastic particles can totally suppress convection .     in a mixture with @xmath110 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , corresponding to @xmath113 , @xmath90 .",
    "doping is measured as percentage of quasi - elastic particles , i.e. @xmath114,width=226 ]    by employing as an order parameter to detect the transition the circulation @xmath21 , of the velocity field , already defined in eq .",
    "( [ circ_def ] ) and varying @xmath115 we obtained the curve depicted in figure  [ fig_circulation ] . in these simulations",
    ", we assumed : @xmath88 , @xmath111 , @xmath116 , @xmath113 , @xmath90 .",
    "while the pure system is in a convective regime , a small `` doping '' ( the critical value is estimated to be @xmath117 ) suppresses convection .",
    "this critical value changes if the relevant parameters of the system ( e.g. @xmath45 or @xmath32 ) are changed .",
    "for example we have verified that increasing @xmath32 the value @xmath118 increases .    in figure  [ fig_impurity ]",
    "we show two different velocity fields observed below and above the critical value of the doping .",
    "it is quite striking to observe how the system behavior changes qualitatively in correspondence of a tiny variation of the doping parameter .",
    "the simple picture of an effective restitution coefficient ( which in this case should be a weigthed average between the two coefficients , using the relative compositions as weights ) could be an interpretation of the results , as in the previous section .",
    "the transition observed in figure  [ fig_circulation ] could be explained as a transition driven by the effective restitution coefficient when the weights are changed .",
    "however the validation of such an hypothesis would require systematic measurements , beyond the aim of the present investigation .    to conclude",
    ", we have explored the possibility of an hysteretic behavior : the system has been prepared with a doping value @xmath115 slightly higher than @xmath118 , but with an initial velocity field corresponding to the convective cell at @xmath119 .",
    "we have studied the temporal evolution of the circulation @xmath120 : the circulation has initially a finite value , but quickly decays to zero , indicating that the convection is rapidly washed out .",
    "this behavior excludes therefore the possibility of hysteresis or long transients .",
    "in this paper , we have studied a two - dimensional granular gas by means of event - driven numerical simulation .",
    "we employed a realistic model regarding both the description of the grains as inelastic hard disks and their interactions with the lateral walls and the horizontally oscillating base .",
    "the present results are in good qualitative agreement with those predicted by the hydrodynamic theory  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we observe the same predicted dynamical regimes and confirm the non - trivial shape of the phase diagram of  @xcite , where the effects of inelasticity , number of monolayers and gravity together influence the appearance or disappearance of convection rolls . within the convective regime ,",
    "the coupling between the various fields ( velocity field , density and granular temperature ) have been characterized . besides",
    ", we have considered the influence of the bidispersity in composition by studying mixtures with different types of grains .",
    "this is important in industrial applications , where monodispersity is always difficult to be obtained .",
    "we found that the addition of a small fraction of quasi - elastic component is able to determine the disappearance of the convective rolls .",
    "our results suggest that a granular binary mixture of grains with different inelasticities behaves , from the point of view of convection , as a monodisperse system with an effective restitution coefficient which is roughly the average ( weighted with the composition fractions of the two species ) of the coefficients of the components .",
    "further investigations are necessary to make this statement more precise .",
