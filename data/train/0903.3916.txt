    "semiclassical method unveils fascinating relation between the properties of quantum transitions and the character of classical dynamics of the system .",
    "this relation is valid , in particular , for tunneling processes  @xcite which do not exist at the classical level .",
    "indeed , tunnelings are described semiclassically by _ complex trajectories _  @xcite evolving classically in complex phase space .",
    "observables characterizing tunneling processes , such as probabilities  @xcite or splittings of energy levels  @xcite , are functionals of complex trajectories .",
    "clearly , features of ( complex ) classical dynamics are imprinted in these observables .",
    "the link between tunneling processes and classical dynamics is supported by theoretical studies of multidimensional tunneling .",

    "in this paper we study impact of non  trivial semiclassical dynamics on temporal characteristics of classically forbidden transitions .",
    "we are particularly interested in cases when complex trajectories describing transitions are unstable .",
    "such trajectories do not interpolate directly between in and out regions of the process , but rather get attracted to a certain unstable orbit lying on the boundary between the regions .",
    "it takes large or even infinite time for a trajectory of this kind to arrive to the out  region . in general one",
    "does not expect the time scale of the semiclassical motion to coincide with the ( properly defined ) duration of quantum transition .",

    "as time goes on , the particle moves towards the potential barrier and eventually traverses it . at @xmath8",
    "the particle is caught by the asymptotically distant macroscopic detector which occupies the region @xmath2 and registers the time of arrival @xmath3 .",

    "note that the total transmission probability @xmath11 is obtained from @xmath12 in the limit @xmath13 .",

    "@xcite , we associate @xmath0 with probability distribution over traversal times @xmath3 .",
    "the average time of passing is then computed as @xmath20 and time dispersion @xmath21 is defined accordingly .",
    "it is worth noting that several assumptions about detector registering the particles have been made in eq .",
    "( [ eq:55 ] ) . first , we adopted approximation of instantaneous measurements disregarding time resolution of the detector .",
    "second , we assumed that the states of particles are not distorted prior to the measurement event .",
    "third , our probability formula ( [ eq:55 ] ) is applicable only in the case of small registration probabilities : true probability of registering the particle at @xmath8 is _ conditional _ with respect to previous non  detection .",
    "for classically forbidden transitions considered below the probability of non  detection is close to @xmath22 and eq .",
    "( [ eq:55 ] ) is applicable . in other cases expression for @xmath12",
    "should be corrected , where @xmath23 is a small number . in this case eq .",
    "( [ eq:55 ] ) is valid , since the probabilities of previous detections are small . ]",
    "@xcite .    equipped with the definition ( [ eq:15 ] ) , we study three examples of quantum processes related to unstable semiclassical trajectories . in all cases",
    "our results confirm the qualitative conclusion  @xcite about large transition times .",

    "semiclassical expressions become accurate as @xmath27 . ] . in the limit of vanishingly small @xmath26 when the system becomes increasingly `` more classical '' the average duration of transition grows to infinity , while @xmath21 stays finite or grows .",
    "this behavior is drastically different from the respective scalings in the case of stable trajectories where @xmath28 reaches definite limit and @xmath21 vanishes as @xmath27 .",
    "we consider the following classically forbidden processes .",
    "first and most importantly , we study tunneling transitions in non  linear multidimensional systems at high energies .",
    "instability of semiclassical dynamics in this case was demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , see refs .  @xcite for earlier works .",
    "we have already sketched the behavior of the corresponding complex trajectories : they approach certain unstable orbit , remain close to it for an infinite time interval and then slide away into the out  region . in systems with two degrees of freedom the mediator unstable orbit describes periodic oscillations near the saddle point of the potential .",
    "we call it _ sphaleron _ or simply _ unstable periodic orbit_. we also attribute instability of respective trajectories to appearance of new mechanism of _ sphaleron  driven _ tunneling ( or tunneling _ driven by unstable periodic orbit _ ) .",
    "recent studies  @xcite revealed two experimental signatures of this mechanism : the probabilities of related processes are suppressed by additional power  law factor  @xcite and distributions over out  state quantum numbers are anomalously wide  @xcite . below",
    "we show that the distribution @xmath0 and corresponding values of @xmath28 and @xmath21 can be used for experimental identification of the sphaleron  driven mechanism of tunneling .",
    "second , we investigate wave packet transmissions through one  dimensional potential barrier .",
    "we consider the case when the average energy of wave packet is lower than the height of the barrier but sufficiently close to it .",
    "then transmission proceeds by _ activation _ caused by energy uncertainty in the initial state .",
    "the probability of such transmission is exponentially suppressed , while the corresponding semiclassical trajectory approaches the top of the barrier and stays there for an infinite time .",
    "this trajectory is unstable ; its behavior is , again , of the type described above .",
    "our calculations show that the forms of the semiclassical traversal ",
    "time distributions are _ universal _ in one dimension : all information about the potential barrier and initial wave packet is encoded in two parameters of the distributions , which can be absorbed by shifting and rescaling @xmath3 .",
    "universal forms of @xmath0 lead to universal qualitative dependencies @xmath29 , @xmath30 in the case of one  dimensional activation transitions .",
    "third and finally , we study the probabilities of large time delays @xmath3 in one  dimensional over  barrier transmissions . in this case",
    "the average energy of particle exceeds the height of the potential barrier .",
    "the particle is registered at time @xmath3 after transmission at a given distance behind the barrier ; we calculate semiclassically the asymptotics @xmath13 of the registration probability .",
    "semiclassical trajectories entering this calculation linger near the barrier top .",
    "the probability at large @xmath3 has universal form , again .",
    "due to delays of the respective trajectories this probability is larger than one would expect naively .    we illustrate our findings by performing explicit calculations in systems with one and two degrees of freedom . in these systems",
    "we compare the semiclassical results for @xmath0 with results of explicit quantum  mechanical calculations .",
    "we find agreement at small @xmath26 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start in sec .",

    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ sec : sphal - driv - tunn ] we discuss the mechanism of sphaleron  driven tunneling and one  dimensional activation processes .",

    "[ sec : semiclassical - method-1 ] .",
    "results for the durations of quantum processes are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] : we consider one  dimensional activation transitions in sec .  [ sec : one - dimension-1 ] , investigate sphaleron  driven tunneling in sec .",

    "time distributions in sec .",
    "[ sec : long - time - asympt ] .",
    "we summarize in sec .",
    "[ sec : concluding - remarks ] .",
    "details of semiclassical and exact quantum  mechanical calculations are presented in appendices .",
    "the controversial issue of quantum traversal time has attracted considerable attention during last decades  @xcite .",
    "the reason for the controversy seems to be hidden within the quantum theory itself which does not offer clear definition or unique method of computing the durations of quantum transitions .",
    "at the moment there exists a number of physically different definitions of quantum traversal time , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite .    expression ( [ eq:15 ] ) belongs to a wide class of definitions involving delay of the transmitted wave packet with respect to the incident one . in this approach",
    "the delay is computed using some feature of wave packet , maximum  @xcite or centroid  @xcite . in our case",
    "the probability conservation law implies that the distribution  ( [ eq:1 ] ) is proportional to the total current through the surface @xmath31 at @xmath8 .",
    "thus , @xmath0 reflects the form of the transmitted wave packet , and mean time of passing ( [ eq:15 ] ) fits into the above class of wave packet  related definitions .",
    "we remark that @xmath32 can be regarded as a probability of registering the particle at time @xmath3 by the point  like detector situated at @xmath33 .",
    "the properties of the definition ( [ eq:15 ] ) are similar to those of other definitions from the same class .",
    "first , the setup used in the introduction resembles recent experiments with photons  @xcite , and one can hope to measure the distribution @xmath0 experimentally .",
    "note , however , that experimental verification of our results , if possible , requires substantial modification of existing experiments .",
    "indeed , recent measurements of traversal times have been performed in quasi ",
    "stationary regime where wave functions of particles are substantially wider than potential barriers . in this case",
    "the interval ( [ eq:15 ] ) coincides  @xcite with the phase time of bohm and wigner  @xcite which is reproduced in actual measurements  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our results are obtained in the `` semiclassical '' case where the coordinate uncertainty is parametrically smaller than the barrier width .",
    "second , the interval  ( [ eq:15 ] ) passes  @xcite self ",
    "consistency check of refs .",
    "@xcite : times of transmission through the barrier and reflection from it have sense of conditional averages over two mutually exclusive events .",
    "third , our traversal time ( [ eq:15 ] ) suffers from hartman effect  @xcite which leads to superluminal velocities of under  barrier motions .",
    "this effect was observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "it is explained as follows .",
    "one notices  @xcite that the out  state of the tunneling process is formed by the waves constituting forward tail of the initial wave packet .",
    "thus , the out  state is not related casually to the central part of the in",
    " state wave function . on the other hand , only the central parts of in and",
    "out states contribute substantially into @xmath28",
    ". since casual connection between these parts is absent , apparent velocity @xmath34 can be superluminal .",
    "we stress that the definition ( [ eq:15 ] ) is sufficient for the purposes of this paper : we regard @xmath35 as an experimentally measurable  @xcite quantity characterizing quantum transitions .",
    "finally , let us remark that quantum traversal time can be naturally defined without any reference to the delay between transmitted and incident wave packets : one can exploit stopwatches attached to the particle  @xcite or observe response of total transmission probability to the periodic modulation of the potential  @xcite . in these approaches the properties of traversal times",
    "are essentially different from those listed above .",
    "although we believe that the qualitative conclusions of this paper should be valid for any reasonable setup , our quantitative results are not applicable for other traversal  time definitions .",
    "let us describe three types of processes related to unstable semiclassical dynamics .",
    "we start with one  dimensional activation transitions of quantum particles through potential barriers @xmath36 . in what follows",
    "we consider the setup in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the initial state @xmath37 is chosen to be a gaussian wave packet with central position @xmath14 , average momentum @xmath38 and momentum dispersion @xmath39 .",
    "transmissions proceed between the in and out regions , @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "points @xmath14 and @xmath15 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] belong to these regions .",
    "we exploit the semiclassical approximation which is justified if @xmath42 here @xmath43 and @xmath44 are height and width of the potential barrier and @xmath45 is the particle mass .",
    "dimensionless parameter @xmath26 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq:27 ] ) measures accuracy of the semiclassical approximation ; one can adjust the value of this parameter by changing @xmath36 . below we adopt dimensionless units @xmath46 . in these units",
    "the height @xmath47 and width @xmath48 of the `` semiclassical '' barrier are parametrically large .",
    "we use the following scalings of the in  state parameters with @xmath26 .",
    "first , we suppose that the typical energy of the process is large , @xmath49 .",
    "second , momentum dispersion is chosen to be of order one , @xmath50 . finally , the points @xmath14 and @xmath15 are taken to be sufficiently far from the potential barrier , so that motion is free at @xmath16 , @xmath51 .",
    "this implies @xmath52 .",
    "we have already mentioned in the introduction that one  dimensional transmissions proceed by activation at some values of in  state parameters .",
    "let us explain the origin of the effect by decomposing the initial state @xmath53 in the basis of plane waves with fixed momenta @xmath54 .",
    "we consider the case @xmath55 when the initial wave packet is mostly formed by `` under  barrier '' modes with @xmath56 . clearly , these modes are exponentially suppressed after transmission . on the other hand , `` over  barrier '' modes with @xmath57 constitute exponentially small fraction of the initial state , but overcome the barrier with probability of order one .",
    "one sees that , depending on the suppressions , the probability @xmath58 can be dominated by `` under  barrier '' or `` over  barrier '' modes .",
    "we call the respective transitions by tunneling and activation .",
    "note that the value of @xmath58 is exponentially suppressed in both cases .",
    "note also that the activation processes are related to the possibility of overcoming the barrier due to finite momentum dispersion in the in  state .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : one - dimension-1 ] we will argue that there always exists some critical value of momentum @xmath59 such that transitions proceed by activation in the region @xmath60 .",
    "we will also demonstrate explicitly that activation transitions are described by unstable semiclassical trajectories which linger near the barrier top .",

    "the saddle point of the potential is shown with thick black dot.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the second type of processes is related to the multidimensional mechanism of sphaleron  driven tunneling . for definiteness",
    "we explain this mechanism in the model of refs .",

    "we propagate semiclassically the in ",
    "state into the out  region and compute the probability @xmath58 and traversal  time distribution @xmath0 .    in the semiclassical regime",
    "the typical energies of motion in @xmath75 direction are parametrically large , @xmath76 .",
    "the scalings of other parameters are chosen in the same way as in the above case of one  dimensional transitions .",
    "we characterize transitions with the combinations @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath39 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 which stay finite as @xmath27 .",
    "note that transmissions between the asymptotic regions of the potential ( [ eq:58 ] ) remain classically forbidden even when the total energy @xmath81 exceeds the minimum height @xmath82 of the potential barrier .",
    "indeed , classical trajectories with energies slightly higher than @xmath43 can overcome the barrier only by passing in the immediate vicinity of the saddle point of the potential .",
    "general trajectory misses this vicinity , and the corresponding transition remains classically forbidden .",
    "the probability of such transition is exponentially suppressed on general grounds .",
    "tunneling transitions at energies exceeding the height of the potential barrier are known as _",
    "dynamical tunneling _  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of sphaleron  driven tunneling is based  @xcite on behavior of complex trajectories in the regime of dynamical tunneling .",
    "one of such trajectories is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] ( thin red line ) .",
    "it overcomes the barrier in two stages , by approaching the unstable periodic orbit ( sphaleron ) and departing from it .",
    "note that the sphaleron is real ; it is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] by thick black line .",
    "this orbit is unstable by construction , since it describes oscillations around the saddle point @xmath83 of the potential .",
    "the semiclassical trajectories in the new tunneling mechanism remain close to the sphaleron for an infinite time interval ; imaginary parts of these trajectories become negligibly small after several sphaleron oscillations .",
    "in general one finds that the sphaleron  driven mechanism is relevant in some region of in  state parameters , @xmath84 , where @xmath59 , @xmath85 are critical momenta depending on @xmath74 and @xmath39 .",
    "regions of low and high momenta , @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively , correspond to direct tunneling through the barrier and classical over  barrier transitions .",
    "we remark that multidimensional processes of sphaleron  driven tunneling are essentially different from the one  dimensional activation transitions considered above : instability of trajectories in the sphaleron  driven case is not caused by finite momentum dispersion .",
    "the third effect considered in this paper is related to the possibility of large time delays in over  barrier wave packet transmissions . for simplicity",
    "we return to one  dimensional setup where gaussian wave packets traverse the potential barrier @xmath36 .",
    "now , we are interested in the case of high initial momenta , @xmath88 , when the central part of wave packet overcomes the barrier classically .",
    "we study the tail of @xmath0 corresponding to large traversal times @xmath3 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : long - time - asympt ] we will argue that this tail can be readily found by considering unstable semiclassical trajectories which linger near the barrier top .    from the physical viewpoint the origin of the effect is explained , again , by decomposing the initial state into a collection of plane waves with fixed asymptotic momenta @xmath54 . in general ,",
    "waves with @xmath89 are populated , although the respective probability is exponentially small .",
    "these waves get delayed near the top of the barrier and create long tail of @xmath0 .",
