    "2003 see also ferguson 1993 ) .",
    "in contrast , hu ( 1992 ) found @xmath7mag toward cooling flow clusters ( but see annis & jewitt 1993 ) .",
    "dust emission from clusters has been marginally detected in the infrared resulting in a dust - to - gas ratio as low as @xmath8 in a few abell clusters ( stickel et al .",
    "2002 ; but see bai et al .",

    "cluster members are known to contain dust ( e.g. , edge et al .",
    "1999 , popescu et al .",

    "however , the survival time for small dust grains mixed with the icm is much shorter than hubble time ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) , and would be absent from the cluster core ( but could survive on large scales ; see dwek et al . 1990 ) unless constantly replenished ( e.g. , montier & giard 2004 ) or shielded from the hot plasma ( e.g. , voit & donahue 1995 ) . presently , there are few meaningful constraints on the composition and quantity of intracluster dust , an understanding of which would have important implications for cluster evolution and metal enrichment processes , as well as for dust physics . in this _",
    "letter _ we provide new answers to 50 years old questions concerning dust in galaxy clusters , by harnessing the power of the _ sloan digital sky survey _",
    "we use a @xmath9 sample of @xmath10 optically - selected clusters from koester et al .",
    "( 2007 ) with velocity dispersions @xmath11 . the mean @xmath12",
    "( the radius within which the galaxy density is @xmath13 the field density ) is @xmath31mpc , and @xmath14 .",
    "the cluster center is defined by its brightest member whose position may deviate from the center of mass by a few@xmath15kpc .",
    "this sample was correlated with the sdss / dr5 spectroscopic quasar catalog ( schneider et al . 2007 ) , identifying all quasars within 10mpc of the clusters centers .",
    "all data were corrected for galactic extinction using the values of schneider et al .",
    "in particular , the spectra were corrected using the reddening curve of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) .",
    "we employ a statistical approach to search for dust by comparing the photometric and spectroscopic properties of quasars at different impact parameters , @xmath16 , from the cluster center with those of quasars in the field .",
    "the sdss quasar selection criteria have no effect on the results and do not bias the observed colors for @xmath17mag ( see mnard et al .",
    "as clusters vary in size , we define a normalized impact parameter : @xmath18 a cluster would induce a mean color excess in background objects whose sight lines pass a distance @xmath19 from its center ( see appendix a ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denote sdss photometric bands , @xmath22 the effective dust optical depth , and @xmath23 the foreground emission by the cluster .",
    "these terms result in effective reddening each having very different signatures ( see fig . 1 where median quasar / early - type cluster galaxy colors were used so that @xmath24_{\\rm quasar / galaxy}=[19.4,19.2,19.1,19.0,18.9]/[21.2,19.9,18.8,18.3,18.0]$ ] ) .",
    "the @xmath25 term arises when quasar colors are luminosity dependent and gravitational magnification , @xmath26 is considerable ( see  3 and the appendix ) .",
    "the analysis proceeds as follows : we define an annulus about the cluster center in the range @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "all quasars within this annulus serve as a primary sample ( consisting of @xmath28 objects for @xmath29 $ ] with the number @xmath30 ) .",
    "many primary samples span the range @xmath31 $ ] with @xmath32 being set by the requirement for adequate s / n and spatial resolution .",
    "we define our control sample to be all quasars with @xmath33 . as",
    "the control sample is large , we choose many random control sub - samples with the same number of objects as the primary sample and compare the geometric mean of their spectral and photometric properties .",
    "this allows us to quantify the mean color excess and its variance via monte carlo simulations .",
    "for the photometric analysis we choose individual control sample quasars to have the same redshift ( up to @xmath34 ) as that of individual primary sample quasars .",
    "this ensures that we are not sampling slightly different observed redshift distributions caused by gravitational lensing .",
    "similarly , for the spectroscopic sample we work in narrow redshift bins ( @xmath35 ) so that our results are not masked by the smearing of quasar emission lines to continuum - like features ( e.g. , york et al .",
    "2006 ) . to test for potential biases we verified that both analyses produce a null mean color excess and a mean spectral ratio of unity , respectively , when comparing different control sub - samples",
    "the color excess is shown in figure [ photo ] as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "clearly , reddening in @xmath36 is detected with high significance .",
    "the color shifts are consistent with known reddening curves so that @xmath37 , indicating that foreground emission by the cluster is negligible ( see fig .",
    "[ photo ] and  4 ) .",
    "our @xmath38 estimate is less secure given the known calibration issues associated with the @xmath39-band filter .",
    "we find @xmath40 values of a few@xmath2mag .",
    "inspection of the color - excess distributions ( not shown ) reveals that the results are not dominated by a few outliers and that most quasars are redder behind clusters .",
    "the qualitative agreement with known reddening curves suggests that @xmath41 is negligible .    motivated by our photometric results we assume that the flux of background quasars is subject only to extinction and magnification so that the ratio of the observed ( flux ) spectrum , @xmath42 , to the intrinsic one , @xmath43 , is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is given by the extinction curve .",
    "in our spectroscopic analysis we consider @xmath46 quasars which ensures i ) that lensing effects , hence @xmath41 , are smaller ( see appendix ) , ii ) adequate s / n at each redshift bin ( see fig . 3 in schneider et al .",
    "2007 showing that @xmath47% of dr5 quasars are in this redshift range ) , and iii ) adequate wavelength coverage excluding the balmer continuum and emission lines band ( which we verified contaminate the signal , especially in lower-@xmath48 objects ; yip et al .",
    "a representative case is shown in fig .",
    "[ spec ] which is nicely fit by a cardelli extinction curve ( other curves give similar results ) .",
    "deviations from a smooth reddening curve at the location of the @xmath49 line are probably a manifestation of the baldwin ( 1977 ) effect ( see appendix b ) . using @xmath50 statistics while avoiding emission line regions and the balmer and   band , gives us the reddening and the extinction , allowing us to deduce the extinction - corrected flux ratio i.e. , the mean observed gravitational magnification , @xmath51 ( see fig .",
    "[ spec ] ) .",
    "we carried out the analysis for each redshift bin and averaged our results over all bins to produce fig .",
    "[ red_mag ] .",
    "typical @xmath40 values are larger than the photometrically deduced values on account of the latter being contaminated by the balmer/ band .",
    "the observed magnification is of order a few per cent .",
    "we deduce finite extinction for quasars behind clusters and our results are consistent with a large covering factor of dust toward these objects .",
    "the dust mass enclosed within a sphere of radius @xmath16 is @xmath52 ( here we used the kramers - kronig relations and grain density of @xmath53 ; krgel et al .",
    "this implies a dust - to - gas ratio for the icm which is @xmath54 of local inter - stellar medium ( ism ; here we used icm mass of @xmath55 within the central mpc ; morandi et al .",
    "if , as suggested by some theoretical models , galaxies eject their ism in amounts comparable to their own mass during their formation , then our results imply that either the associated dust is in a clumpy form with a small covering factor or else it is rapidly destroyed and the metals are deposited in the icm .",
    "large scale distributions of dust could arise from a non - virialized gas component at the outskirts of clusters left from past merger events or related to halos of neighboring galaxies and small groups provided their size is of mpc scales . singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) models , where dust follows dark matter ,",
    "seem to over - predict the extinction on small scales ( see figs .",
    "[ photo ] & [ red_mag ] ) indicating that the centers of clusters may be relatively devoid of ism - like dust .",
    "our results indicate that foreground emission is not important .",
    "this means that the contribution of foreground light that enters a ( median ) quasar s point - spread function is @xmath56mags fainter in the @xmath48-band ( fig.1 and appendix a ) and requires that most sight lines pass @xmath57 ( de - vaucouleur ) half - light radii ( @xmath58kpc ; see fig . 4 in bernardi et al .",
    "2003 ) from a median cluster member . repeating the entire analysis for quasars",
    "whose sight lines pass @xmath59kpc from confirmed members yields similar results .",
    "we estimate foreground light contamination by resolved and non - resolved cluster members ( using a luminosity function with a slope of @xmath60 extrapolated down to @xmath61 , and including 25% of blue galaxies ; hansen et al .",
    "2007 ) to be at the per cent level , and hence negligible .",
    "the observed magnification was found to be few per cent on mpc scales .",
    "correcting for luminosity function effects ( see appendix b ) the intrinsic magnification is of order 10% , which is in qualitative agreement with sis model predictions for the magnification of a @xmath62 quasar behind a rich @xmath63 cluster being @xmath64 ( e.g. , mnard et al . 2007 ) .",
    "given the uncertainties on the dark - matter profile , our approximation for the sdss selection function and the luminosity function of quasars , we find this agreement to be surprisingly good .",
    "it also implies that grey opacity ( by large grains that survived for a hubble time at the cluster center ) is not required . the above agreement , the fact that the deduced reddening and magnification follow different trends at small @xmath19 ( figs .",
    "[ photo ] & [ red_mag ] ) , and the good fit to known reddening curves , all suggest that our results are not significantly contaminated by luminosity - dependent intrinsic color differences in the lensed quasar population .",
    "the agreement between the photometric and spectroscopic results , which are prone to different systematics , is also reassuring .",
