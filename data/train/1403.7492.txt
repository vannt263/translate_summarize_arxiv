    "the equation of state  ( eos ) is the central quantity for the study of compact stars .",
    "since modern lattice qcd simulations are not applicable at large baryon densities and low temperatures @xmath2 , there is a large uncertainty in theoretical descriptions of the behavior of matter at extreme densities .",
    "the understanding may be improved by studying astrophysical phenomena ; namely , we may use the known astrophysical constraints from observations of compact stars in order to provide constraints on the eos .",
    "recently , the idea has been pursued to use a bayesian analysis ( ba ) for `` inversion '' of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations , i.e. to extract a probability measure for models of the cold eos in the pressure - energy density plane from observational data related to masses and radii of compact stars .",
    "while first analyses of this type have favored burst sources with rather uncertain and model dependent statements about radii @xcite , a very recent ba uses a set of stronger and statistically independent observations , testing also the possibility of a first order phase transition at supersaturation densities @xcite .    at this point the strongest restriction to the eos is provided by the recent measurement of the high mass of @xmath3 from observations of the pulsars psr j1614 - 2230 by demorest et .",
    "@xcite and psr j0348 + 0432 by antoniadis et .",
    "the recent ba @xcite makes use of this constraint together with a new mass - radius constraint from the precise timing analysis of the nearest known millisecond pulsar psr j0437 - 4715 @xcite and the constraint on the gravitational binding for the neutron star b in the binary system j0737 - 3039(b ) @xcite , see also @xcite , at the precisely measured gravitational mass of @xmath4 .",
    "there are many studies relating astrophysical phenomena involving compact stars and the properties of matter at extreme densities , eventually including the possibility of a quark deconfinement transition .",
    "these concern , e.  g. , the cooling of compact stars  @xcite , gravitational wave emission @xcite , neutrino emission  @xcite , eigenfrequencies  @xcite , and the energy release during the collapse of neutron stars to quark stars  @xcite .",
    "the study of the baryon - baryon ( bb ) interaction in lattice qcd simulations recently became a hot topic  @xcite .",
    "experiments like jparc will also provide valuable information on the bb interaction . in the near future the eos in the hadronic phase may be determined by incorporating this information on the bb interaction in the brckner - hartree - fock  ( bhf ) theory  @xcite , the variational approach  @xcite , or the dirac - brckner - hartree - fock  ( dbhf ) theory  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we adopt the bhf theory for hadronic matter .    out of a several of possible models for quark matter we use the two flavor covariant non - local nambu  jona - lasinio ( nlnjl ) model @xcite with vector interactions @xcite .",
    "the advantage over the usual local version of the njl model is due to the introduction of the additional gradient self - energy channel and due to the explicit momentum dependence of all the dressing functions of the quark propagator .",
    "both of these improvements are well founded on lattice qcd data @xcite and dyson - schwinger equation studies @xcite , and make the non - local njl model a well - calibrated , effective low - energy qcd approach to the thermodynamics of quark matter .    the main purpose of this work is to examine the features and the astrophysical consequences of the mixed phase between the pure quark and hadron matter phases by considering _",

    "this model gives a quite simple description of quark matter , and it should be replaced by a more sophisticated one to study more realistically the quark - hadron phase transition .",
    "this is the aim of the present work .",
    "we construct the hybrid eos and the corresponding hybrid star sequences . for the calculation of the quark matter eos we use the following values for the ratio of the vector and the scalar channel couplings @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "stable hybrid stars respecting the @xmath0 constraint are found in the case of @xmath11 .",
    "the bulk gibbs construction for this case supports only a mixed phase in the core .",
    "however , taking into account finite - size effects the cores of massive hybrid stars are composed of pure quark matter .",
    "for @xmath10 the @xmath12 stars are mainly composed of hadron matter . with the appearance of quark matter at higher densities",
    "the star becomes unstable .",
    "for @xmath11 quark matter appears at low densities causing a reduction of the proton fraction at the onset of the mixed phase below the threshold value of @xmath13 for the onset of the direct urca ( durca ) process in the @xmath14 phase , while for @xmath10 the proton fraction exceeds this value .",

    "we have studied the hadron - to - quark - matter phase transition with _",

    ", the eos of the hadron - quark phase transition gets close to that given by the maxwell construction .",
    "this is due to the mechanical instability of the geometrical structure induced by the surface tension .",
    "the pressure of the mixed phase shows a similar behavior to that of the bag model @xcite .",
    "it appears that this behavior of the hadron - quark phase transition is universal .",
    "since the eos has many uncertainties , especially concerning quark matter we plan to study this behavior using other quark and hadron models such as @xcite . moreover , color superconductivity may also change our results @xcite .",
    "we have found that the models used here describe compact star sequences with maximum masses exceeding the present constraint of @xmath126 as deduced from observations @xcite .",
    "for the low value of the vector coupling quarks appear at low densities , which might work in favor of suppressing the durca cooling channel in nuclear matter by the early onset of quark matter .",
    "if we conjecture that future observations would find quark matter in neutron stars our results would indicate that vector interactions in the quark phase are small , unlike the ones in nuclear matter .    since the phase transition to quark matter leads to a softening of the eos ,",
    "this is usually associated with the reduction in the maximum mass .",
    "the fact that the nuclear eos employed in this work gives a neutron star surpassing @xmath12 therefore works in favour of obtaining a sufficiently heavy hybrid star to exceeding @xmath12 as well .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that this statement depends on the relative stiffness of the nuclear and the quark eos at the highest densities reached in the core .",
    "there are notable exceptions in the literature , see e.  g.  @xcite where one finds an opposite scenario so that the maximum mass of the hybrid star is actually larger than the maximum mass of the pure nuclear star .    in the context of the microscopically founded eos model presented in this paper with the bhf approach to the hadronic phase and the nonlocal chiral quark model for the deconfined phase",
    ", the nonstrange hybrid star scenario appears as the most conservative one .",
    "scenarios including strangeness in the hadronic and/or quark matter phase may require additional stiffening effects , that are beginning to be explored @xcite , in order to meet the @xmath12 mass constraint .",
