    "interacting particle systems with stochastic dynamics @xcite and particularly the one - dimensional asymmetric exclusion process ( asep ) have been intensively studied @xcite-@xcite , due to connections to growth processes @xcite , traffic flows @xcite , the noisy burgers equation @xcite and the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation @xcite .",
    "being one of the simplest examples of integrable non - equilibrium systems , the asep allows calculation of some dynamical properties @xcite , gs , a large deviation function @xcite , and conditional probabilities @xcite .    in a standard formulation @xcite , particles move in such a way that there is always at most one particle per site on the one - dimensional lattice .",
    "every particle hops to its right or left with biased probabilities provided the target site is empty .",
    "otherwise , it does not move . using a traffic terminology , this kind of interaction between particles",
    "can be called a `` soft braking '' .",
    "another kind of interaction is an aggressive braking  @xcite,@xcite , when a particle pushes the particle in front of it and then stops .",
    "the displaced particle shifts the next particle in front , if any , and so on . as a result ,",
    "a chain of adjacent particles is shifted by one lattice space left or right at the same moment of time . despite apparent non - locality of dynamics ,",
    "the bethe ansatz method is still applicable and the resulting bethe equations are solvable parallel to the asep case . further generalizations of the asep have been proposed @xcite,@xcite . in every case , however , an elementary motion of a particle produces a deterministic reconstruction ( local or non - local ) of the preceding lattice state .",
    "the beginning of intensive study of the asep nearly coincides with a burst of interest to the threshold dynamics and avalanche processes . appeared originally in the sandpile model of self - organized criticality @xcite",
    ", the avalanche processes have been shown to be related to many different phenomena ranging from an interface depinning to earthquakes @xcite .",
    "as an example of the threshold dynamics one can again consider asep - like stochastic model at the one dimensional  lattice . in this case",
    ", however , we admit multiple occupation of a lattice site by particles . like in the asep , each particle hops to its right or left .",
    "if the number of particles @xmath3 at given site exceeds some critical value @xmath4 , the site is unstable and must relax immediately .",
    "the relaxation consists in spilling of @xmath5 particles from the given site to neighboring sites by a fixed rule .",
    "if the neighboring sites become unstable , they relax as well .",
    "thus , an avalanche of relaxations spreads over the lattice .",
    "the time interval between beginning and ending of every avalanche is negligible in comparison with characteristic hopping time of a single particle .    comparing to the asep with the aggressive braking",
    ", a fundamental difference appears , when the spilling rule is stochastic @xcite . in this case",
    ", the structure of avalanche becomes complicated .",
    "unstable states may appear randomly even if an underlying structure of the lattice state is regular before an avalanche starts .",
    "then , the distance at which avalanches propagate and the total mass of particles involved in an avalanche are random values described by probabilistic distributions .",
    "the configurations of particles in the lattice states before and after an avalanche may differ considerably , and the latter results from the first by a series of stochastic spillings .",
    "another peculiarity of avalanche dynamics is a specific transition into a totally unstable state , when the density of particles exceeds some critical value and an avalanche never stops in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely large lattice @xcite .",
    "this transition corresponds to change of the time scale characterizing the system , which can be defined for example as a ratio of system size to average velocity of particles . while for low density",
    ", the slow diffusion processes prevail , the fast avalanches dominate above the transition point .",
    "the existing of two time scales was shown to be responsible for reaching of the self - organized critical state in systems with avalanche dynamics .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a mathematical description of one kind of avalanche processes , the one - dimensional asymmetric avalanche process ( asap)@xcite . the asap is a partially asymmetric diffusion process with the totally asymmetric avalanche propagation .",
    "the similar directed one - dimensional stochastic avalanches have been considered in @xcite , where the asymptotic of avalanche distributions in the self - organized critical state have been calculated exactly for the open lattice in the thermodynamic limit . instead",
    ", we study the asap on a ring with a fixed number of particles . in this case , the critical value of the density exists , depending on spilling probabilities , which corresponds to the transition from the intermittent to continuous flow when the fast avalanche dynamics becomes dominating . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on dynamical properties of the asap below this point .",
    "one of the reasons for the intensive interest to the asep is that it being exactly solvable gives a discrete version of the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation @xcite . in the scaling limit",
    ", one can get analytically the universal quantities like critical exponents and scaling functions characterizing a vast class of nonequilibrium phenomena belonging to the kpz universality class . on the other hand ,",
    "the universal scaling properties of avalanche dynamics are much less investigated .",
    "there are very few successful attempts , @xcite-@xcite , to find analytical arguments allowing one to relate the avalanche - like processes with one of well - defined universality classes such as the kpz , edwards - wilkinson or directed percolation @xcite .",
    "in the present work , we show that the generating function of the total distance @xmath6 travelled by particles in the asap is given in the scaling limit by the expression @xmath7where @xmath8 does not depend on parameters of the model and has the following parametric form @xmath9and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are model dependent parameters .",
    "this universal form of function @xmath8 was claimed to be the feature of the kpz universality class @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it also determines the universal form of the large deviation function characterizing the deviations of the integrated particle current from its average value .",
    "these results give an evidence that the asap  shares the kpz universality class with the asep despite the significant difference in their dynamics .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we consider the master equation for a general stochastic model which leads to the asep and asap in particular cases . in section 3",
    ", we derive the bethe ansatz equations for the generating function of the total displacement of all particles .",
    "a particular case of the asap is considered in section 4 where the asap becomes identical to a drop - push version of the asep .",
    "the general case of the asap is considered in section 5 . using the method developed in @xcite,@xcite , we analyse the integral equation corresponding to the density of roots of the bethe equations and derive the generating function for the total displacement of particles . from it",
    "we obtain the expression for the cumulants of total distance travelled by particles , like mean velocity and variance , its large deviation function , and demonstrate that the asap belongs to the kpz universality class .",
    "in this section we are going to obtain the master equation describing asap , which is defined as follows . consider the system of @xmath12 particles on a ring of @xmath13 sites as shown in fig .",
    "particles jump left or right with probabilities @xmath14 or @xmath15 respectively , for infinitesimal time @xmath16 independently of each other . when a particle comes to already occupied site after the hopping either from left with the rate @xmath17 or from right with the rate @xmath18 , an avalanche starts .",
    "it develops step by step according to the following dynamical rules .",
    "if , at some step of the avalanche , @xmath3 @xmath19 particles are at site @xmath20 , then    with probability @xmath21 , @xmath3  particles go to the site @xmath22 ;    with probability @xmath23 , @xmath24 particles go to the site @xmath22 and one particle stays at the current site @xmath20 .",
    "we imply that an avalanche takes infinitesimal time to end , i.e. from the point of view of poissonian processes it plays a role of interaction resulting in the transition between configurations with single particle occupation .",
    "the totally asymmetric case discussed in @xcite corresponds to particular choice of the rates , @xmath25 . in the case of the asep",
    "a particle step to already occupied site is forbidden .",
    "however , it will be shown below to be closely connected with the asap . to make the presentation more systematic we start from the system of free particles then going to asep and asap dynamics .",
    "the state @xmath26 of the system at time @xmath27 is characterized by the probability",
    "@xmath28 satisfying the master equation @xmath29the off - diagonal elements @xmath30 of the matrix @xmath31 are rates of transitions from configurations @xmath32 to @xmath26 and therefore are always positive .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath33 that give the total rate of the transition from the state @xmath26 to all other configurations , enter the matrix @xmath31 with a minus sign .",
    "conservation of probability requires the identity @xmath34    let us return to particles at the lattice . consider noninteracting particles jumping left or right with probabilities @xmath14 or @xmath15 respectively , for infinitesimal time @xmath16 .",
    "the probability @xmath35 for particles to occupy sites @xmath36 obeys the master equation @xmath37if @xmath38.we impose the condition @xmath39 by an appropriate choice of time scale .    in the asep",
    ", the form of the master equation should be modified if configuration @xmath26 contains pairs of neighboring occupied sites .",
    "if there are only two neighboring sites , @xmath40 occupied by particles ,  the master equation differs from eq.([master1 ] ) by the extra term @xmath41 .",
    "if  there are more than one pair , one must substract the other unwanted terms from the eq.([master1 ] ) for every pair to obtain equations taking into account the exclusion rules .",
    "instead , one can reduce the consideration to the free master equation only , if one equates the appeared extra terms to zero  putting the boundary conditions for the physical domain @xmath42 :    @xmath43    the terms like @xmath44 corresponding to multiple occupation of sites do not contribute to the dynamics due to the exclusion rule .",
    "therefore , they can be considered as auxiliary non - physical terms and redefined by the boundary conditions so that all extra terms in free equation vanish giving the correct equation for the system with interaction .",
    "consider now more general condition of type eq.([asepbc ] ) with the coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 which do not coincide necessarily with the rates @xmath18 and @xmath17 in eq.([master1 ] ) and will be defined later , @xmath47    to provide the probabilistic meaning of the eq.([master1 ] ) together with eq.([asapbcgeneral ] ) , some constraints should be imposed on @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in this case",
    ", we still use the exclusion rule that allows one to use the terms of type @xmath44 as auxiliary ones which should be redefined in appropriate way .",
    "the condition eq.(asapbcgeneral ) itself does not eliminate the contribution of extra terms yet .",
    "nevertheless , we can try to use this condition  to replace the unwanted terms by terms consisting of allowed configurations only . to this end",
    ", we can exploit the fact that two unphysical terms in eq.(asapbcgeneral ) are of similar structure and consider this relation as a recursion : @xmath48to proceed , it is convenient to consider the two - particle case separately .",
    "if there are only two particles at the lattice , the recursion eq.(x , x->x+1,x+1 ) can be immediately solved in terms of allowed configurations only :    @xmath49    where , due to periodic boundary conditions , all coordinates are integers modulo @xmath50 . substituting eq.([rec2left ] ) into the eq.([master1 ] ) rewritten for the two particle case under the condition @xmath51 , we get@xmath52where @xmath53 .  to give a probabilistic meaning to the transition rates , the terms corresponding to the processes",
    "when the system leaves the configuration @xmath54 should be non - positive and those for coming into @xmath54 from other configurations should be non - negative . to keep probabilities positive , we have to impose the condition that either @xmath55 is positive or @xmath56 ,  when the term containing the infinite sum vanishes .",
    "in addition , conservation of probability , eq.([conserv ] ) , requires @xmath57    then , the condition @xmath56  implies @xmath58 , @xmath59 , i.e. the ordinary asep .",
    "in the case @xmath60 , we have @xmath61and can rewrite eq.([master2 ] ) in the form @xmath62 in terms of @xmath55 , the boundary condition , eq.([x , x->x+1,x+1 ] ) reads @xmath63the expression eq.([ex2 ] ) shows that in addition to the poissonian hopping given by the original kinetic equation , new terms appear in the equation which correspond to transitions to the configuration @xmath64 from the configurations @xmath65 @xmath66 .",
    "the rates of the transitions are @xmath67 . in the case of two particles ,",
    "these rates determine the avalanche dynamics defined above .    to show the relation between asep and asap before going into details of the solution , let us consider the moment when an avalanche starts .",
    "this happens if either the left particle of two neighboring ones moves right with the rate @xmath17 or the right particle moves to the left with the rate @xmath18 and then  two particles together make at least one step together with probability @xmath55 .",
    "then an avalanche starts with the rate @xmath68 .",
    "this expression indeed enters those parts of kinetic equation , which correspond to the avalanche dynamics .",
    "thus , the rate of beginning of an avalanche becomes zero when @xmath56 , and only exclusion dynamics remains .",
    "therefore , we may treat asep as an analytical continuation of asap with a parameter @xmath55 taking a special negative value .",
    "one can expect that the @xmath3-particle interactions imposes @xmath3 new constrains on the master equation eq.([master1 ] ) .",
    "however , in this section we will show that under certain constraint on toppling probabilities @xmath21 no new boundary conditions appear and eq.([bouncond2 ] ) is sufficient to take into account the interaction of arbitrary number of particles .    to generalize the boundary condition , eq.([bouncond2 ] ) , for the description of many particle dynamics defined above one should express an unstable configuration via configurations appeared at the previous steps of an avalanche .",
    "the form of these conditions depends on the fact whether the site @xmath69 is occupied or not :    @xmath70    if the site @xmath69 is occupied , and @xmath71if @xmath69 is empty .    like the two - particle boundary condition , eq.([bouncond2 ] )",
    ", the many - particle conditions , eqs.([boundcond3 ] ) and ( [ boundcond4 ] ) , should be applied recursively . applying this recursion step by step to infinity",
    ", we generate an infinite series that consist of the transition probabilities between stable configurations only .    on the other hand",
    ", one may treat the term @xmath72 formally applying the two - particle boundary condition eq.([bouncond2 ] ) , reducing sequentially the number of particles in unstable sites . as a result",
    ", we obtain    @xmath73    due to recursion , parameters @xmath21 are expressed through the only parameter @xmath55 : @xmath74 or @xmath75 generally , eq.([boundcond5 ] ) and eqs.([boundcond3]),([boundcond4 ] ) do not coincide",
    ". however , the final series entering the kinetic equation which result from the sequential use of either latter or two former of them will be the same , provided that the transition probabilities @xmath21 from eqs.([boundcond3 ] ) and ( [ boundcond4 ] ) governing the avalanche dynamics satisfy eqs.([mun ] ) and ( [ munrec ] ) .",
    "indeed , every term of resulting series represents a finite avalanche .",
    "it contains the product of terms @xmath21 and @xmath76 coming from the successive use of the recurrent relations , eqs.([boundcond3]),(boundcond4 ) or eq.([boundcond5 ] ) .",
    "the first term of the r.h.s of eq.([boundcond3 ] ) increases the number of particles at the unstable site by 1 in comparison with the l.h.s .",
    "the second term of the r.h.s  of  eq.([boundcond4 ] ) decreases the number of particles by 1 . obviously , in every finite avalanche , the numbers of decreasing and increasing events are equal .",
    "therefore , the coefficients @xmath76 from eq.([boundcond3 ] ) and @xmath77 from eq.([boundcond4 ] ) always enter the product corresponding to the avalanche in pairs and interchanging their places do not affect the structure of the final series . on the other hand , the interchanging @xmath77 and @xmath76 between eqs.([boundcond3 ] ) and ( [ boundcond4 ] ) leads to eq.([boundcond5 ] ) obtained from eq.(bouncond2 ) .",
    "thus , we have shown that the two - particle boundary condition , eq.([bouncond2 ] ) , is sufficient for obtaining the kinetic equation for many particle avalanche process governed by the above dynamical rules . in the bethe ansatz formalism",
    ", a similar procedure is known as the two- particle reducibility  @xcite and provides integrability of a system .",
    "consider the generating function of the total path @xmath78 travelled by all particles between time @xmath79 and @xmath27 provided that the system is in configuration @xmath26 at time @xmath27 @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the joint probability that the system is in configuration @xmath26 and the total distance is @xmath78 to the time @xmath82 the equation for the generating function and a boundary condition can be obtained from the master equation eq.([master1 ] ) and the boundary condition for the probability eq.([bouncond2 ] ) by multiplying by @xmath83 every term corresponding to increasing ( decreasing ) distance @xmath78  by @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85    @xmath86    the sum of the function @xmath87 over all configurations gives the generating function of moments of total distance @xmath6 , whose behavior is determined by the largest eigenvalue @xmath88 of eq.([masterf ] ) for large @xmath27 .",

    "the master equation eq.([masterf ] ) and the boundary conditions eq.([boundaryf ] ) allow one to use the bethe ansatz in a usual form @xmath96 where the summation is over all permutations of @xmath97 the eigenvalue corresponding to eigenvalue eq.(ansatz ) is @xmath98 the parameters @xmath99  satisfy the bethe equations @xmath100 which follow from the substitution of eq.([ansatz ] ) into eq.(boundaryf ) and the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the largest eigenvalue of the master equation corresponds to the stationary state of markov process , so , one has to choose the solution of eqs.([bae ] ) which provides the eigenvalue of the master equation for probability of eq.([master1 ] ) to be equal to zero @xmath101",
    "the perron - frobenius theorem ensures that this eigenvalue has no crossing in the whole range of @xmath95 .    to solve the bethe equations ,",
    "it is convenient to transform the variables @xmath102 . after the change of variables @xmath103 the system ( [ bae ] ) can be rewritten in the following way @xmath104 corresponding eigenvalue has the form @xmath105",

    "this , however , does not affect the function @xmath193 as its skewness is related only to the avalanche direction rather than to the poissonian drift .",
    "at the same time full inversion transformation in the asap corresponds to simultaneous transformations @xmath198 and @xmath202 , which changes the direction of avalanches as well as that of poissonian drift .",
