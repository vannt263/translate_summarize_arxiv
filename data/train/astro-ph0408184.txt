    "while the existence of `` dark '' matter particles ( dmps ) is one of the main pillars of the standard cosmological paradigm , the nature of these particles and the way they interact with the ordinary matter are still unknown .",
    "presently the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) is the most popular candidate for the role of the dmp , but as long as it remains undetected other candidates present viable alternatives . strongly interacting heavy particles",
    "are produced non - thermally in some cosmological scenarios ( e.g. griest & kamionkowski 1990 ; chung , kolb & riotto 1998 ) .",
    "underground experiments , which are primarily designed to search for wimps , are insensitive to particles whose interaction cross - section with baryons , @xmath0 , is above @xmath7 .",
    "since the flux of such particles is heavily diluted by the ground or even by the atmosphere ( albuquerque & baudis 2003 ) , the most rigorous constraints are based on satellite experiments ( wandelt et al . 2000 ) and observations of astrophysical systems ( starkman et al . 1990 ; chen et al .",
    "2002 ) current constraints allow for super - heavy particles with masses above @xmath8 with a wide range of cross sections with ordinary matter . on the low side ,",
    "dmps with @xmath9 are still admissible .    in this paper",
    "we examine the role of short range interactions between the dmps and protons in galaxy clusters . as particles fall into the halos ,",
    "the gravitational virial theorem implies that baryons and dmps acquire similar velocities , @xmath4 .",
    "since the kinetic energy of a particle of mass @xmath10 is @xmath11 , the direction of collisional energy transfer between baryons and dmps depends mostly on their masses . for @xmath12 and large enough collisional cross section , heating by dm overcomes",
    "radiative cooling and increases the temperature .",
    "if this were the case for galaxy clusters , then we would expect to find the largest temperatures at their centers , where the density and collision rates are highest . however , in most clusters the observed temperature decreases towards the center .",
    "this allows us to place a new upper limit on @xmath0 . for velocity independent scattering",
    "the new limit is two orders of magnitude lower than the previous limit obtained from stability analysis of galactic disks and dm halos @xcite .",
    "qin & wu ( 2001 ) have argued that for @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which is similar to the range of strong interaction , energy transfer from dm to baryons can explain the deficit of cold gas ( @xmath15 k ) in the cores of clusters of galaxies , as suggested by chandra and xmm - newton observations ( kaastra 2001 , peterson 2001 , tamura 2001 ) .",
    "here we elaborate on the work of qin and wu ( 2001 ) in several ways .",
    "we use a more accurate description of the radiative cooling and heating rates and consider the consequences of a velocity dependent cross section . further , we account for the increase in the velocity dispersion of the dark matter as it contracts while transferring energy into the protons . we show that unless the cross - section strongly varies with energy , a state of thermal equilibrium between heating by the dmps and radiative cooling is unstable .    the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we write down the relevant equations . in  3 we check the requirements for the stable thermal balance between radiative cooling and heating by dmps . in ",
    "4 we derive analytic upper limits on the cross sections .",
    "we present numerical solutions in  5 and conclude with a discussion in  6 .",
    "we begin by writing down the equations governing the temperature and density of a gas element subject to radiative cooling and heating by collisions with dark matter particles . as the self - gravitating dark matter particles transfer energy to the baryons , they get closer to the center and become hotter .",
    "although the mass dark matter particle is much larger than that of the proton , the energy density is not and therefore we must account for the increase in the velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles .",
    "we denote the gas heating and cooling rates , both per unit volume , by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding rates per unit mass are @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the total number density of all particles in a fully ionized primordial plasma .",
    "the energy balance equation is most conveniently expressed in terms of the entropy .",
    "we define an `` entropy '' as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the electron number density in @xmath23 and @xmath24 is in @xmath25 .",
    "the entropy obeys , @xmath26 the advantage of this form of the energy balance equation is that the adiabatic heating / cooling is readily included .",
    "as will be shown below , in the first approximation the heating rate @xmath16 depends on the dark matter properties only through the energy density ( per unit volume ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number density of dark matter particles , and @xmath29 is their velocity dispersion . according to the virial theorem @xmath30",
    "therefore , @xmath31 there are three time - scales in the problem , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 which correspond , respectively , to the radiative cooling , heating of gas by collisions with dm particles , @xmath33 , and kinetic energy gain of dark matter .",
    "these time scale are given by @xmath35 the virial theorem implies that after the collapse the energy densities of dm and gas relate as their mass densities , @xmath36 .",
    "however , the energy acquired by protons during the collapse is very quickly shared with electrons and helium ions so that the velocity dispersion of these species is fixed by energy equipartition .",
    "therefore , initially we have @xmath37 .",
    "subsequent effects of dm - baryon interaction are then determined by the equations ( [ eq : ent ] ) and ( [ eq : virial ] ) .",
    "the cross section @xmath0 must satisfy the condition @xmath38 otherwise the temperature would increase at the central regions , contrary to observations .",
    "the last condition is sustained by hydrodynamical simulations which show that as clusters form their temperature profiles increase towards the center ( e.g. navarro , frenk & white 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , if the heating by dmps is stronger than cooling then the temperature will always be highest at the center .",
    "if the mass and typical kinetic energy of a dmp are much larger than those of a proton , @xmath13 and @xmath39 , then the dmp recoil in a single scattering with proton can be neglected . in this case , the gas heating rate per unit volume is ( qin & wu 2001 ) @xmath40 where we have assumed maxwellian energy distribution for the dmps and protons , @xmath29 and @xmath41 are , respectively , the velocity dispersions of dmps and protons , and @xmath42 . assuming a power law dependence , @xmath43 , of the cross - section on the relative speed @xmath44 transforms eq .",
    "[ qw ] into @xmath45 for integer values of @xmath46 the above integrals can be solved analytically . however , the solutions are quite cumbersome , so it is more convenient to use an approximation @xmath47 in the central regions of clusters @xmath48 , which allows further simplification of eq .",
    "[ h0 ] @xmath49    we write the cooling rate as ( tozzi & norman 2001 ) as @xmath50 \\ ;   \\label{eq : tozzi}\\ ] ] in units of @xmath51 .",
    "the number density of ions @xmath52 and electrons @xmath22 are in @xmath23 .",
    "for metallicity of one third solar , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 and @xmath24 is in kev .",
    "because the term @xmath58 never vanishes ( see equation [ eq : virial ] ) , a strict thermal equilibrium can not hold . however , the time scale , @xmath34 , for significant changes in @xmath59 is typically a factor of @xmath60 longer than the time scale , @xmath33 , for heating the baryons .",
    "therefore , it is meaningful to address the question of whether a quasi - equilibrium with @xmath61 ( see equation [ eq : ent ] ) is thermally stable over time - scales shorter than @xmath34 .",
    "we express @xmath16 and @xmath17 in terms of @xmath62 and the pressure @xmath63 .",
    "we take @xmath64 and @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 represents all quantities that are independent of @xmath68 and @xmath62 .",
    "further , we write @xmath69 . equation ( [ eq : ent ] ) is then @xmath70 let the r.h.s vanish for @xmath71 at @xmath72 and consider variations in @xmath62 at constant pressure @xmath72 . substituting @xmath73",
    ", the last equation gives @xmath74 to first order in @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , the system is stable for @xmath76 . for @xmath77 and metallicity of one third solar , @xmath78 , so that @xmath79 . for clusters with lower temperatures and higher metallicity @xmath80 , and we get @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , the dependence of the cross section must be steep in order to obtain thermal stability over time scales @xmath82 .",
    "to allow the temperature at the core to fall the cooling must overcome the heating , @xmath83 . since both @xmath17 and @xmath84 are not constant , the value of @xmath0 which gives the thermal balance changes over time",
    ". however , unless the condition @xmath83 is not satisfied from the start , it will never be satisfied later",
    ". thus we may derive the upper limit on the cross - section by using the initial conditions of clusters .",
    "for @xmath85 the stringiest limit is obtained from the hottest clusters where the cooling is dominated by bremsstrahlung and the cooling function is well approximated by @xmath86 where @xmath62 is in k. the limit on @xmath0 is obtained from the condition ( [ eq : lim2 ] ) using the expressions ( [ h01 ] ) and ( [ eq : lapp ] ) .",
    "taking @xmath87 , the condition ( [ eq : lim2 ] ) yields since for a given @xmath88 both the initial cooling and heating rate are proportional to @xmath89 . ]",
    "@xmath90 for energy independent scattering ( @xmath91 ) we get @xmath92 which for the hottest clusters , such as rx j1347.5 - 1145 with @xmath93 k ( allen , scmidt & fabian 2002 ) , yields @xmath94 for @xmath95 it is the coldest clusters ( @xmath96 k ) which give the stringiest limit . there",
    "[ l1 ] is no longer a very good approximation and the full cooling function has to be used .",
    "therefore we present the limit graphically in fig .",
    "[ figx ] .",
    "the above calculations ignore several additional heating processes such as agn , thermal conduction and sn feedback .",
    "however , if these are important they will make our limits even more restrictive .",
    "we show now results of numerical integration of the equations ( [ eq : ent ] ) and ( [ eq : virial ] ) , for various values of initial temperatures @xmath62 using the full expression for the cooling rate given by ( [ eq : tozzi ] ) . our goal is to confirm the upper limit derived in the previous section and to demonstrate that a reasonable temperature evolution is obtained for energy dependent cross sections .",
    "we would like to integrate the equations with initial conditions describing the physical state in the cool cores of clusters before cooling and heating become important .",
    "the initial temperature in the core can be extrapolated from the outer regions assuming an initial isothermal profile .",
    "we also need the initial number density , @xmath97 , in the core .",
    "this is more tricky to obtain as the observed @xmath97 is likely to be substantially different from its initial value and from the measured value in the outer regions . to illustrate the effect of varying @xmath97 we experiment here with two choices for @xmath97 .",
    "we use three values for the initial temperatures , @xmath98 , 8 and 3 kev .",
    "candidates for clusters with these temperatures are , respectively , rx j1347.5 - 1145 ( allen , schmidt & fabian 2002 , a2204 ( pointecouteau , arnaud & pratt 2005 ) , and a1991 ( pratt & arnaud 2005 ) respectively .",
    "for each temperature , we integrate the equations for two values of the initial number density : @xmath99 and 0.007 @xmath23 . at the initial time",
    "the condition @xmath100 is assumed to hold .",
    "note that for a nfw density profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) the product @xmath101 is independent of position in the central regions .",
    "we further assume that the gas pressure ( @xmath102 ) is equal to its initial value .",
    "the equations are integrated forward for various values of @xmath62 .",
    "figure ( [ fig1 ] ) shows the temperature evolution for for velocity independent cross sections , i.e. @xmath91 .",
    "the three panels show the temperature evolution for three respective values of the initial temperature and initial @xmath97 of @xmath103 ( dashed curves ) and @xmath104 ( dotted ) . the solid curve in each panel label is obtained with radiative cooling only . in each panel",
    "three different values of @xmath0 have been used .",
    "these values , in units of @xmath105 , are indicated by the numbers attached to the dashed curves .",
    "these three values are also used in obtaining the dotted curves ( higher values correspond to higher curves ) .",
    "no single value of the cross section is able to balance radiative cooling for all temperatures .",
    "the value of @xmath97 clearly affects the time - scale of the evolution , with the larger @xmath97 giving the faster evolution .",
    "an inspection of this figure allows us to place an upper limit on the cross section .",
    "the strongest constraint is derived from the highest temperature observed clusters of @xmath106 ( allen , schmidt & fabian 2002 ) . according to top panel @xmath107 , consistent with our previous estimate in ",
    "[ upper ] . exceeding",
    "this limit produces temperature profiles rising towards the center of all clusters , contrary to observations .",
    "the limit is insensitive to @xmath97 .    in figure ( [ fig2 ] )",
    ", we show the temperature evolution obtained from the clusters obtained with @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the thin and thick lines correspond to @xmath111 and 0.015 @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the solid , dotted and dashed are for initial temperatures of @xmath112 , 8 and @xmath113 .",
    "the late time temperature increase seen for some of the curves is caused by the enhancement of heating as a result of virial contraction of the dark matter halo . however , even for initial @xmath114 , the temperature increase is minor at @xmath115 , corresponding to a redshift of @xmath116 .",
    "overall , we conclude a cross section with a steep dependence on energy can balance cooling in clusters of galaxies .",
    "qin & wu ( 2001 ) have suggested that collisional energy transfer from heavy dark matter particles ( @xmath117 ) to protons can balance cooling and thus explain the deficit of the cold gas in clusters ( kaastra 2001 , peterson 2001 , tamura 2001 ) . in the original qin & wu scenario the cross section",
    "is assumed to be a constant independent of energy ( i.e. the relative velocity between the interacting proton and dm particle ) .",
    "we have found that @xmath118 heating of dm with a constant cross section can not offset cooling for clusters of different virial temperatures , and @xmath119 any thermal equilibrium obtained with a constant @xmath120 , is unstable .",
    "however , an significant upper limit on cross sections that are independent of velocity can be obtained by demanding the temperature not to rise towards the center , as seen in observations .",
    "our upper limit on @xmath0 versus the mass is represented in the diagram shown in figure ( [ fig4 ] ) which also shows previous limits ( wandelt et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "our study incorporates the contraction of dark matter halo as it transfers energy to the protons .",
    "this contractions leads to an increase in the velocity dispersion of dm particles and hence to an enhancement of the heating rate .",
    "however , for time scales short compared with @xmath34 one can study the thermal stability of the system .",
    "we have found that for @xmath121 a stable thermal equilibrium is possible for @xmath122 ( for @xmath123 kev and metallicity below 0.6 solar ) . for strong interactions",
    "the scattering cross - section is expected to have a weak dependence on velocity .",
    "however , electromagnetic interactions with @xmath124 may fit very well .",
    "the dmp with a unit charge and mass a few times above @xmath125 gev , which is just outside the conservative limit on charged dmp ( de rujula et al .",
    "1990 ) , seems optimal for suppressing the cooling flow .",
    "furthermore dmps of such mass if produced in thermal equilibrium would explain the present value of @xmath126 ( griest & kamionkowski 1990 ) .",
    "another attractive feature of heating by dark matter is that it preserves the metal gradient seen in observations of some clusters ( e.g. bohringer et al .",
    "this is advantageous over mechanical sources of heating such as agn feedback which tend to reduce the metal gradients .",
    "an alternative possibility for stable thermal balance is a dmp with mass comparable to @xmath3 . in this case",
    "protons and dmps have comparable energies .",
    "thus no matter how large @xmath0 is , no runaway heating will occur .",
    "one problem with this scenario is that it leaves a very narrow range for @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath127 gev the allowed values of @xmath0 are too low to achieve thermal balance ( wandelt et al . 2000 ) . on the other hand dmps with @xmath128 gev",
    "will typically be less energetic than baryons at the central region .",
    "a second problem is that observationally the baryon fraction declines towards the center .",
    "if the dmps and protons are in thermal balance , then the dmps with @xmath129 can have steeper density profile only if their velocity distribution has significant anisotropy .",
    "the calculations we have done for protons can be extended to other gas particles , such as electrons and helium ions .",
    "thus for velocity independent interaction we find that for helium @xmath130 , while for electrons with @xmath131 and @xmath132 , the limit is @xmath133 .",
    "our analytic treatment is based on the local values of physical parameters and therefore can not accurately account for the potentially important processes of convection or the change of central pressure in response to the changing temperatures . to describe these effects in detail a hydrodynamical simulation",
    "is needed .",
    "this is feasible since the relevant heating function is easy to incorporate in these simulations .",

    "he also thanks the national astronomical observatory of japan and the oxford astrophysics department for the hospitality and support .",
