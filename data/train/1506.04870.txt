    "spectral unmixing is one of the most active topics for remotely sensed hyperspectral data exploitation @xcite . in general , most methods use linear mixture model ( lmm ) due to its simplicity , where lmm assumes that each observed pixel in a hyperspectral image is linearly combined by a set of pure spectra or _",
    "endmembers_. within the lmm paradigm , three main types of unmixing algorithms can be identified : geometrical , statistical , and sparse regression - based @xcite .",
    "geometrical unmixing algorithms work under the assumption that the endmembers of a hyperspectral image are the vertices of a simplex of minimum volume enclosing the dataset ( i.e. , the set of hyperspectral vectors ) or of a simplex of maximum volume contained in the convex hull of the dataset @xcite , such as the minimum - volume enclosing simplex ( mves ) @xcite , minimum volume simplex analysis ( mvsa ) @xcite , the successive volume maximization ( svmax ) @xcite , and etc . among minimum volume algorithms ,",
    "we highlight the minimum volume constrained nonnegative matrix factorization ( mvc - nmf @xcite ) which is also based on nmf principles . as their name suggests , statistical methods @xcite are based on analyzing mixed pixels by means of statistical principles , such as bayesian approaches @xcite .",
    "finally , sparse regression - based algorithms @xcite are based on expressing each mixed pixel in a scene as a linear combination of a finite set of pure spectral signatures that are known _ a priori _ and available in a library .",
    "although each of these methods exhibits their own advantages and disadvantages , the fact is that geometrical approaches have been the ones most frequently used by the hyperspectral research community up to now @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to their reduced although still quite high computational cost when compared with the other types of unmixing algorithms , as well as to the fact that they represent a straightforward interpretation of the lmm . in order to fully unmix a given hyperspectral image by means of a geometrical method ,",
    "the majority of the state - of - the - art approaches are based on dividing the whole process into three concatenated steps @xcite : 1 ) estimation of the number of endmembers ; 2 ) identification of the spectral signatures of these endmembers ; and 3 ) estimation of the endmember abundances in each pixel of the scene . in the last few years",
    ", several techniques have been developed for addressing each part of the chain , with particular emphasis on the identification of endmembers ( with and without assuming the presence of pure spectral signatures in the input hyperspectral data @xcite ) .",
    "the recently introduced conmf algorithm @xcite addresses simultaneously the three unmixing stages .",
    "in addition to a quadratic data term , comnf uses two regularizers : a ) the @xmath0 mixed norm @xcite applied to the abundance matrix , which promotes sparsity among the rows of that matrix , and , therefore , it selects the active endmembers , and b ) a volume regularizer which simultaneously promotes minimum volume and pushes the endmembers with zero abundances toward the mean value of the dataset . in spite of the good results obtained with conmf , it has two weaknesses : a ) there is no guarantee of convergence ; b ) in some cases , we observe a negative joint effect of the volume and mixed norm regularizers . in this paper",
    ", we modify comnf aiming at removing those weaknesses .",
    "the former is removed by introducing a pao solver to compute a critical point of the objective function .",
    "the latter is removed by modifying the volume regularizer aiming at robustness to noise and degenerated simplexes as often happens with real data and relatively high number of endmembers .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : approach ] introduces r - conmf .",
    "section [ sec : results ] presents results based on synthetic hyperspectral data sets .",
    "comparisons with the mvc - nmf are also included .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] draws some conclusions and hints at plausible future research lines .",

    ", we have @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5\\in{\\mathbb{r}}^{d\\times p}$ ] is a so - called mixing matrix containing @xmath6 endmembers , @xmath7 denotes the @xmath8-th endmember signature , @xmath9\\in{\\mathbb{r}}^{p\\times n}$ ] is the abundance matrix containing the endmember fractions @xmath10 , for pixels @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the abundance non - negativity constraint ( to be understood in component - wise sense ) , and @xmath13 is the sum - to - one constraint ( @xmath14 stands for a column vector of ones with @xmath6 elements ) .",
    "finally , @xmath15 collects the errors that may affect the measurement process ( e.g. , noise ) .      in this work , we address the estimation of @xmath6 , _",
    "i.e _ , the number of endmembers , as well as the estimation of the mixing matrix @xmath16 , and the abundance matrix @xmath17 .",
    "although @xmath6 is not known beforehand , we assume that we have access to an overestimate thereof .",
    "that is , we are given a number @xmath18 such that @xmath19 . in this way",
    ", we account for a common situation in which an overestimate of the number of endmembers is easy to compute , which is not usually the case regarding the true number of endmembers .",
    "we tackle the estimation of @xmath6 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 by seeking a solution for the following nmf optimization : @xmath20 where @xmath21 stands for the frobenius norm , @xmath22\\in { \\mathbb{r}}^{d\\times q}$ ] and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 will denote , respectively , the @xmath8-th row , and the @xmath8-th column of @xmath26 ) are optimization variables , linked with the mixing matrix @xmath27 and the abundance matrix @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the relation between @xmath29 and @xmath30 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration_row_sparsity ] ; the term @xmath31 denotes the @xmath0 ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) mixed norm of matrix @xmath32 , the term @xmath33 denotes the minimum volume regularizer , @xmath34 $ ] is a set of @xmath18 spectral observed vectors inferred with a pure - pixel algorithm , thus _",
    "close _ to the extremes of the simplex , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are regularization parameters , @xmath37 is the collection of @xmath38 matrices whose columns belong to the probability simplex of dimension @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the collection of matrices of size @xmath41 whose colums belong to the the affine set of dimension @xmath39 that best represents the data @xmath42 in the mean square error sense .",
    "the introduction of this constraint removes the shortcomings associated violations to the sum - to - one constraints usually observed in real datasets .",
    "norm under the linear mixing model .",
    "the abundance matrix @xmath17 is formed my the nonzero rows of @xmath26 , while the mixing matrix @xmath16 is formed by the correspondent columns of @xmath43.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    the objective function shown in ( [ eq : nmf_criterion ] ) has three terms : a data fidelity term @xmath44 , which promotes solutions with low reconstruction error ; an @xmath0 mixed norm @xmath45 , which promotes row sparsity on @xmath26 @xcite ( that is , it promotes solutions with complete rows @xmath46 set to zero ) ; and a minimum volume term @xmath33 , which pushes the simplex defined by @xmath47 towards the simplex defined by @xmath48 which , given that the it is defined by observed vectors , is inside the true simplex .",
    "this volume regularizer is a fundamental device of r - conmf as it largely reduces the sensitive of the solutions of due to bad conditioning of the true mixing matrix @xmath27 and to perturbations of the samples close to the simplex facets .",
    "the nonconvex data fidelity term @xmath49 present in ( [ eq : nmf_criterion ] ) makes the respective optimization hard .",
    "herein , we adopt the following pao iterative algorithm : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the objective function shown in and @xmath52 are two positive constants .",
    "we remark that the above procedure can be interpreted as a regularized version of a two block non - linear gauss - seidel method @xcite .",
    "the poa algorithm - is an instance of the class considered in @xcite for which the convergence to a critical point is proved in the theorem 9 of the same paper .",
    "optimization is a small size quadratic problem , thus very light , and optimization is a constrained @xmath53 problem which we solve effectively with the csunsal algorithm @xcite .",
    "r - conmf may be applied either assuming that a ) the number of endmembers is know or b ) unknown . in the former case , we set @xmath54 and @xmath35 to a very small value , thus removing the @xmath0 regularizer from the objective function , although keeping the constraint set @xmath55 . in the latter case , we first apply r - conmf to infer the number of endmembers and then we apply again r - conmf as described in scenario a ) .",
    "let us consider the scenario b ) .",
    "in this case , we run r - conmf for a fixed @xmath56 .",
    "lets us define @xmath57 , for @xmath58 , as a measure of the sparsity of abundances associated with the corresponding endmembers @xmath59 , for @xmath58 .",
    "ideally , we should have @xmath60 if @xmath59 is not active .",
    "due to the impact or noise and model errors , we relax that criterion as follows : we consider that an endmember @xmath59 is active , if @xmath61 , for a small @xmath62 .",
    "[ fig : re ] shows the obtained @xmath63 and the reconstruction error for a problem with @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and zero - mean gaussian iid noise with snr@xmath66db , where @xmath67 .",
    "the applications of the above criterion with any value of @xmath68 between 0.5 and 4 yields @xmath64 , which is the correct estimate of the number of endmembers .",
    "notice that , this number could also be obtained from the plot of the reconstruction error . in more complex scenarios with lower snr and a larger number of endmembers , we may devise a strategy to combine both indicators .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      in a second experiment we evaluate the performance of r - conmf in the case that the number of estimated endmembers coincides with the number of real endmembers , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath69 . here",
    ", we use the mvc - nmf algorithm in @xcite as a baseline for comparison with our method . table [",
    "p4pr4table ] displays the results obtained by mvc - nmf and our proposed r - conmf algorithm for all considered performance discriminators for different values of @xmath70 . in all cases , we considered an snr of 30 db and reported the results obtained from averaging the results of 30 monte carlo runs .    from the results reported on table [ p4pr4table ] , we can make the following observations .",
    "first and foremost , when there are only a few endmembers existing in the image ( say , @xmath71 ) , both r - conmf and mvc - mnf obtained very good results .",
    "this is expected , since in this case it is relatively easy to solve the optimization problem .",
    "it is interesting to observe that , as the number of endmembers increases , the r - conmf obtained very good performance ( note the good performance obtained for the case @xmath72 ) . even in a very difficult scenario such as @xmath73 , the solution provided by r - conmf",
    "is still useful .",
    "it should be noted that , in cases with a relatively high number of endmembers ( i.e. , @xmath74 ) , the mvc - nmf yields useless results .",
    "this is because , when the number of endmember increases , most pixels are likely to fluctuate around the facets , a situation in which minimum volume - based algorithms are likely to fail @xcite . even in this difficult scenario ,",
    "in which the mvc - nmf could not provide feasible results ( labeled as  - \" in table [ p4pr4table ] ) , the proposed r - conmf was able to provide a reasonable solution . based on this experiment",
    ", we can conclude that r - conmf is quite robust and has no strong constraints related with the quality of the analyzed data set .    for illustrative purposes , fig .",
    "[ p6pr6figurea ] shows the signatures estimated by r - conmf and mvc - nmf .",
    "the estimated spectral signatures by r - conmf are similar to the real ones , while those estimated by mvc - nmf are slightly different .",
    "similar observations can be made from the difference maps between the real and estimated abundance maps , as shown in fig .",
    "[ p6pr6figureb ] , where the difference of r - conmf is much smaller than that of the mvc - nmf .",
    "the results in this subsection indicate that the r - conmf can perform very accurately in the case that the number of endmembers is known _ a priori _ ,",
    "i.e. @xmath69 .",
    "in this paper , we propose r - conmf , which is robust version of the collaborative nonnegative matrix factorization ( conmf ) algorithm , which estimates the number of endmembers , the mixing matrix , and the corresponding abundances .",
    "the proposed r - conmf algorithm fills a gap in the hyperspectral unmixing literature as it is one of the few algorithms that can accomplish the three main steps of the unmixing chain in fully automatic fashion , without the need to resort to external algorithms . in the future",
