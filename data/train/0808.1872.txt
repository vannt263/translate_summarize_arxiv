    "pn encompass an equally large age spread , as well as different spatial and kinematic distributions .",
    "they usually present bright emission lines and can be easily distinguished from other emission line objects , so that their chemical composition and spatiokinematical properties are relatively well determined . in this work ,",
    "we present some recent results on the determination of chemical abundances from pn in the large and small magellanic clouds , and compare these results with data from our own galaxy and other galaxies in the local group .",
    "we also investigate the time evolution of the oxygen abundances in the smc by deriving an age - metallicity relation for this object .",
    "planetary nebulae and hii regions are particulary useful to study chemical abundances in the galaxy as well as in other objects of the local group , especially since the advent of 4 m class telescopes .",
    "while hii regions reflect the present chemical composition of the star - forming systems , pn can trace the time evolution of the abundances , especially when an effort is made to establish their age distribution ( see for example maciel et al .",
    "2005 ) . the elements s , ar and ne are probably not produced by the pn progenitor stars , as they are manufactured in the late evolutionary stages of massive stars .",
    "therefore , s , ar and ne abundances as measured in pn should reflect the interstellar composition at the time the progenitor stars were formed . since in the interstellar medium of a star - forming galaxy such as the milky way and the magellanic clouds the production of o and ne",
    "is believed to be dominated by type ii supernovae , we may conclude that the original o and ne abundances are not significantly modified by the stellar progenitors of bright pn , which makes them particularly useful for chemical evolution studies .",
    "an example is the determination of radial abundance gradients and their variations , which provide an essential constraint for chemical evolution models ( cf .",

    "* maciel et al . 2006b ) ) .",
    "the variation of the ratios s / h , ar / h and ne / h with o / h show a good positive correlation for all studied systems in the local group , with similar slopes .",
    "the main differences lie in the average metallicity of the different galaxies , which can be inferred from the observed metallicity range .",
    "the galactic nebulae extend to higher metallicities [ up to @xmath0(o ) = log o / h + 12 = 9.2 ] , and the lmc objects reach @xmath0(o ) = 8.8 , while the lowest metallicities in the smc are about @xmath0(o ) = 7.0 . as an example",
    ", fig.[fig1 ] shows the ne / h ratio as a function of o / h for the smc , while fig.[fig2 ] includes the pn from the lmc as well . in these figures",
    "we include the combined samples by our group ( cf .",

    "* stasiska et al . ( 1998 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",

    "* costa et al . ( 2004 ) ) for the disk",
    ".    pn are also extremely useful to determine the metallicity distribution in a given system , as accurate abundances of o , s , ne , ar and s are often measured .",
    "a comparison of the distribution in different systems can be used to infer their average metallicities , with consequences on the star formation rates . as an example",

    "the metallicity distribution of pn in the galactic bulge can be used as an important tool in order to constrain galactic chemical evolution models , as shown by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* maciel ( 1999 ) ) .",
    "we investigated the chemical evolution of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) based on abundance data of planetary nebulae ( for details see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* idiart et al .",
    "the main goal is to study the time evolution of the oxygen abundance in this galaxy by deriving an age - metallicity relation , which is of fundamental importance as an observational constraint for chemical evolution models of the smc .",
    "we have used high quality pn data to derive the properties of the progenitor stars , so that the stellar ages could be estimated , using theoretical evolutionary tracks from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vassiliadis & wood ( 1992 ) ) .",
    "we collected a large number of measured spectral fluxes for each nebula and derived accurate physical parameters ( effective temperatures , luminosities , masses and ages ) and nebular abundances . new spectral data for a sample of pn in the smc were obtained between 1999 and 2002 , based on observations secured at the eso - la silla 1.52 m and lna - brazil 1.6 m telescopes .",
    "these data are used with data available in the literature to improve the accuracy of the fluxes for each spectral line .",
    "we obtained accurate chemical abundances for about 44 pn in the smc .",
    "our derived oxygen - versus - age diagram is shown in fig.[fig4 ] . a similar relation involving the [ fe / h ] metallicity",
    "was derived on the basis of a correlation with stellar data .",
    "we have obtained the converted [ fe / h ] metallicities by calibrating an [ o / h ] @xmath1 [ fe / h ] relationship matching the abundances of the youngest objects in our sample according to the models by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pagel & tautvaiiene ( 1998 ) ) .",
    "taking into account the implications of the derived age - metallicity relation for the smc formation , we suggest a star formation burst in the last 23 gyr which is also apparent from fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "this behaviour is in agreement with some recent results based on stellar clusters and data on field stars ( cf .",
    "e. grebel , these proceedings ) , according to which there is no smooth age - metallicity relation for the smc , at least during the last few gyr ."
