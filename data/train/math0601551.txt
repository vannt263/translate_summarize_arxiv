    "we consider small - amplitude three - dimensional doubly periodic travelling gravity waves on the free surface of a perfect fluid .",
    "these _ unforced _ waves appear in literature as steady 3-dimensional water waves , since they are steady in a suitable moving frame .",
    "the fluid layer is supposed to be infinitely deep , and the flow is irrotational only subjected to gravity .",
    "the bifurcation parameter is the horizontal phase velocity , the infinite depth case being not essentially different from the finite depth case , except for very degenerate situations that we do not consider here .",
    "the essential difficulty here , with respect to the existing literature is that _ we assume the absence of surface tension_. indeed the surface tension plays a major role in all existing proofs for three - dimensional travelling gravity - capillary waves , and when the surface tension is very small , which is the case in many usual situations , this implies a reduced domain of validity of these results .    in 1847",
    "stokes @xcite gave a nonlinear theory of _ two - dimensional _ travelling gravity waves , computing the flow up to the cubic order of the amplitude of the waves , and the first mathematical proofs for such periodic two - dimensional waves are due to nekrasov @xcite , levi - civita levicivita and struik @xcite about 80 years ago .",
    "mathematical progresses on the study of _ three - dimensional _ doubly periodic water waves came much later .",
    "in particular , to our knowledge , first formal expansions in powers of the amplitude of three - dimensional travelling waves can be found in papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one can find many references and results of researches on this subject in the review paper of dias and kharif @xcite ( see section 6 ) .",
    "the work of reeder and shinbrot ( 1981)reed - shin represents a big step forward .",
    "these authors consider symmetric diamond patterns , resulting from ( horizontal ) wave vectors belonging to a lattice @xmath8 ( dual to the spatial lattice @xmath9 of the doubly periodic pattern ) spanned by two wave vectors @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the _ same length _ , the velocity of the wave being in the direction of the bissectrix of these two wave vectors , taken as the @xmath12 horizontal axis .",
    "we give at figure [ fig1 ] two examples of patterns for these waves ( see the detailed comment about these pictures at the end of subsection diamond ) .",
    "these waves also appear in litterature as `` short crested waves '' ( see roberts and schwartz @xcite , bridges , dias , menasce b - d - m for an extensive discussion on various situations and numerical computations ) . if we denote by @xmath6 the angle between @xmath10 and the @xmath13 axis , reeder and shinbrot proved that bifurcation to diamond waves occurs provided the angle @xmath6 is not too close to 0 or to @xmath14 and provided that the _ surface tension is not too small_. in addition their result is only valid outside a `` bad '' set in the parameter space , corresponding to resonances , a quite small set indeed .",
    "this means that if one considers the dispersion relation @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively a wave vector and the velocity of the travelling wave , then there is no resonance if for the critical value of the velocity @xmath18 there are only the four solutions @xmath19 of the dispersion equation , for @xmath20 ( i.e. for @xmath16 being any integer linear combination of @xmath10 and @xmath21 .",
    "the fact that the surface tension is supposed not to be too small is essential for being able to use lyapunov - schmidt technique , and the authors mention a _ small divisor problem if there is no surface tension _ , as computed for example in rob - schw .",
    "notice that the existence of spatially bi - periodic _ gravity _ water waves was proved by plotnikov in @xcite , @xcite in the case of finite depth and for fixed rational values of @xmath22 , where @xmath23 are respectively the acceleration of gravity , the wave length in the direction of propagation , and the velocity of the wave .",
    "indeed , such a special choice of parameters avoids resonances and the small divisor problem , because the pseudo - inverse of the linearized operator is bounded .",
    "is computed with formula ( [ un ] ) .",
    "top : @xmath24 ; bottom : @xmath25 .",
    "the dashed line is the direction of propagation of the waves .",
    "crests are dark and troughs are grey.,title=\"fig:\",height=182 ]   is computed with formula ( [ un ] ) .",
    "top : @xmath24 ; bottom : @xmath25 .",
    "the dashed line is the direction of propagation of the waves .",
    "crests are dark and troughs are grey.,title=\"fig:\",height=182 ]    craig and nicholls ( 2000 ) @xcite used the hamiltonian formulation introduced by zakharov @xcite , in coupling the lyapunov - schmidt technique with a variational method on the bifurcation equation . still in the presence of surface tension , they could suppress the restriction of reeder and shinbrot on the `` bad '' resonance set in parameter space , but they pay this complementary result in losing the smoothness of the solutions . among other results , the other paper by craig and nicholls ( 2002 ) @xcite gives the principal parts of `` simple '' doubly periodic waves ( i.e. in the non resonant cases ) , expanded in taylor series , taking into account the two - dimensions of the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "they emphasize the fact that this expansion is only formal in the absence of surface tension .",
    "mathematical results of another type are obtained in using `` spatial dynamics '' , in which one of the horizontal coordinates ( the distinguished direction ) plays the role of a time variable , as was initiated by kirchgssner @xcite and extensively applied to two - dimensional water wave problems ( see a review in @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of this method is that one does not choose the behavior of the solutions in the direction of the distinguished coordinate , and solutions periodic in this coordinate are a particular case , as well as quasi - periodic or localized solutions ( solitary waves ) . in this framework",
    "one may a priori assume periodicity in a direction transverse to the distinguished direction , and a periodic solution in the distinguished direction is automatically doubly periodic .",
    "the first mathematical results obtained by this method , containing 3-dimensional doubly periodic travelling waves , start with haragus , kirchgssner , groves and mielke ( 2001 ) @xcite , @xcite , harag - kirch , generalized by groves and haragus ( 2003 ) @xcite .",
    "they use a hamiltonian formulation and center manifold reduction .",
    "this is essentially based on the fact that the spectrum of the linearized operator is discrete and has only a finite number of eigenvalues on the imaginary axis .",
    "these eigenvalues are related with the dispersion relation mentioned above . here ,",
    "one component ( or multiples of such a component ) of the wave vector @xmath16 is imposed in a direction transverse to the distinguished one , and there is no restriction for the component of @xmath16 in the distinguished direction , which , in solving the dispersion relation , gives the eigenvalues of the linearized operator on the imaginary axis . the resonant situations , in the terminology of craig and nicholls correspond here to more than one pair of eigenvalues on the imaginary axis , ( in addition to the origin ) . in all cases",
    "it is known that the largest eigenvalue on the imaginary axis leads to a family of periodic solutions , via the lyapunov center theorem ( hamiltonian case ) , so , here again , there is no restriction on the resonant set in the parameter space at a fixed finite depth .",
    "the only restriction with this formulation is that it is necessary to assume that the depth of the fluid layer is finite .",
    "this ensures that the spectrum of the linearized operator has a spectral gap near the imaginary axis , which allows to use the center manifold reduction method .",
    "in fact if we restrict the study to periodic solutions as here , the center manifold reduction is not necessary , and the infinite depth case might be considered in using an extension of the proof of lyapunov - devaney center theorem in the spirit of @xcite , in this case where 0 belongs to the continuous spectrum .",
    "however , it appears that the _ number of imaginary eigenvalues becomes infinite when the surface tension cancels _ , which prevents the use of center manifold reduction in the limiting case we are considering in the present paper , not only because of the infinite depth .",
    "since we are looking for waves travelling with velocity @xmath26 , let us consider _ _  the system in the moving frame _ _ where the waves look steady .",
    "let us denote by @xmath27 the potential defined by@xmath28where @xmath29 is the usual velocity potential , @xmath30 is the 2-dim horizontal coordinate , @xmath31 is the vertical coordinate , and the fluid region is @xmath32which is bounded by the free surface @xmath33 defined by@xmath34we also make a scaling in choosing @xmath35 for the velocity scale , and @xmath3 for a length scale ( to be chosen later ) , and we still denote by @xmath36 the new coordinates , and by @xmath37 the unknown functions . now defining the parameter @xmath38 ( the froude number is @xmath39 where @xmath0 denotes the acceleration of gravity , and @xmath40 the unit vector in the direction of @xmath41 the system reads@xmath42    * hilbert spaces of periodic functions .",
    "* we specialize our study to _ spatially periodic 3-dimensional travelling waves _ , i.e. the solutions @xmath43 and @xmath27 are _ bi - periodic in _ @xmath44",

    "@xmath55 in such a case the functions on @xmath56 are 2@xmath57 periodic in @xmath58 2@xmath59 periodic in @xmath60 and invariant under the shift @xmath61 ( and conversely ) .",

    "moreover , the average of the right hand side of ( [ basic1 ] ) is 0 as it can be easily checked ( this is proved for instance in @xcite ) .",

    "this result is proved in particular by craig and nicholls in craig - nicholls2000 , and by d.lannes in @xcite .",
    "notice that @xmath104 is an algebra for @xmath105 .",
    "notice that it is proved by craig et al @xcite that the mapping @xmath106 is analytic and the authors give the explicit taylor expansion near 0 , with the same type of `` tame '' estimates that we shall use in the following sections .",
    "we choose here to stay with @xmath107 and we just use the @xmath102 smoothness of the mapping , in addition to the tame estimates ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the equivariance of @xmath98 under translations of the plane is obvious .",

    "we show that for @xmath151 ( @xmath163 the bifurcating ( diamond ) waves of size @xmath164 occur for @xmath165 while for @xmath166 it occurs for @xmath167 we prove that bifurcation of these 3-dimensional waves occurs on half lines @xmath168 of the plane , with their origin on the critical curve , for `` good '' values of @xmath128 ( which appear to be nearly all values of @xmath169 moreover , we prove that on each half line , these waves exist for `` good '' values of @xmath170 this set of `` good '' values being asymptotically of full measure at the bifurcation point @xmath171 ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .    .",
    "the good set of points is asymptotically of full measure at the vertex on each half line ( see the detail above ) . in the paper",
    "we only give the proof for each half line @xmath172 ( dashed line on the figure ) , height=182 ]    another way to describe our result is in terms of a bifurcation from a non isolated eigenvalue in the spectrum of the linearized operator at the origin .",
    "indeed , for our critical values @xmath173 of the parameter , the differential at the origin is a selfadjoint operator with in general a non isolated 0 eigenvalue ( see theorem [ 141l ] ) .",
    "our result means that from each point @xmath174 where @xmath128 is chosen in a full measure set of @xmath175 , a branch of solutions bifurcates in the following sense .",

    "in fact , we can improve our result in replacing the half lines mentioned above , by _ small sectors centered on these half lines_. each half line in each sector , with origin at the vertex of the sector , contains a measurable set where the bi - periodic gravity waves exist , with an amplitude @xmath177 , this set being asymptotically of full measure near @xmath178 the proof of such a result introduces many technicalities , which are not essential for the understanding of the paper .",
    "this complication is mainly due to the fact that we then need to work with a lattice @xmath9 now depending on @xmath179 we just mention in various places what is really needed for such an extension of the result proved here .",
    "there are some aspects of our method which deserve brief mention .",
    "first we use the nash - moser method , which is now an integral part of nonlinear analysis @xcite , for proving theorem [ thmexistence0 ] . the crucial point for the nash - moser method",
    "is to obtain a priori bounds on an approximate right - inverse of the partial derivative @xmath180 . as it is shown in section 2 ,",
    "this problem is equivalent to the problem of invertibility of a second - order selfadjoint pseudodifferential operator with multiple characteristics .",
    "second , we use the moser theory of foliation on a torus @xcite and the _ invariant parametric representation _ of the dirichlet - neumann operator to reduce the linearized equation to a canonical form with constant coefficients in the principal part .",
    "we employ a modification of the weil theorem @xcite on uniform distribution of numbers @xmath181 modulo @xmath182 to deduce the effective estimates of _ small divisors _ , and hence to prove the invertibility of the principal part of the linearized operator",
    ". the most essential ingredient of our approach is the algebraic _ descent method _ @xcite , @xcite which allows to reduce the canonical pseudodifferential equation on @xmath183-dimensional torus to a fredholm - type equation .",
    "now we can explain the organization of the paper . in section 2",
    ", we prove theorem [ lembifurc ] which establishes the existence of approximate solutions under the form of power series of the amplitudes of the two incident mono - periodic travelling waves , corresponding to symmetric basic wave vectors . _",
    "the parameter is two - dimensional here _ , due to the freedom in the direction of propagation of the three - dimensional wave . to show this result",
    ", we use a formal lyapunov - schmidt technique , assuming that the angle @xmath1 between the two basic wave vectors satisfies that @xmath184 is such that the equation for positive integers @xmath185 @xmath186has the unique solution @xmath118 ( non resonance property ) . in playing with scales and parameters , this condition is not restrictive among non resonant situations , which indeed represent the general case . in such a case ,",
    "the kernel of the linearized operator at rest state ( taken as the origin ) is four - dimensional , and in using extensively the symmetries of the system ( [ f(u , mu)1 ] ) , we obtain , for a fixed value of the bifurcation parameter @xmath187 doubly - periodic formal travelling gravity waves propagating in the direction @xmath40 . limiting cases are the mono - periodic travelling waves corresponding to one of the basic wave vectors .",
    "the lemma [ lembifurc0 ] is a particular case of the above theorem .    from now on ,",
    "we restrict the study to solutions called `` diamond waves '' , which are _ symmetric with respect to the direction of propagation _",
    ", here the @xmath13 axis . in section 3",
    "we consider the linear operator @xmath188 corresponding to the differential of ( [ f(u , mu)1 ] ) at a non zero point in @xmath189 , which we need to invert for using the nash - moser theorem .",
    "the principal part of this operator is the symmetric sum @xmath190 of a second order derivative in the direction of a periodic vector field @xmath191 , and of the dirichlet - neumann operator which is integro - differential of first order , both parts depending periodically on coordinates .",
    "more precisely , @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is the first fundamental form of the free surface . recall that @xmath194 is a covariant tensor field on @xmath195 , and for the standard parametrization @xmath196 , it is given by @xmath197 .",
    "it follows from the kinematic condition that integral curves of the vector field @xmath191 coincide with trajectories of liquid particles moving along @xmath195 and submitted to the vertical gravity @xmath198 .",
    "section 3 is concerned with the first step of the long way towards the inversion of @xmath199 which consists in finding a diffeomorphism of the torus for which the highest order terms of the operator @xmath200 become constants ( depending on the linearization point ) .",
    "we begin ( lemma [ changevar1 ] ) with the construction of a diffeomorphism which takes integral curves of the vector field @xmath201 onto straight lines parallel to the abscissa axis .",
    "being endowed with the jacobi metric @xmath202 the free surface becomes a riemannian manifold on which the integral curves of @xmath201 coincide with geodesics ( see appendix [ particles ] ) .",
    "hence , by lemma [ changevar1 ] , they form a geodesic foliation on @xmath195 . moreover , since the distance between each of these curves and the abscissa axis is finite , the foliation has a zero rotation number .",
    "it is at this point where the restriction to symmetric solutions ( diamond waves ) is necessary , since we do nt know yet how to manage such a diffeomorphism in the non symmetric case , see @xcite for discussion .",
    "recall that the moser theorem @xcite guarantees the existence of at least one geodesic for any given rotation number .",
    "the second result of section 3 is theorem [ thmdir - neum ] which gives the parametric representation of the dirichlet - neumann operator in arbitrary coordinates @xmath203 on @xmath195 so that a mapping @xmath204 is a diffeomorphism of a torus .",
    "it follows from this theorem that for any smooth periodic function @xmath205 and @xmath206 , the dirichlet - neumann operator has the decomposition @xmath207 in which @xmath208 are pseudodifferential operators of order @xmath209 .",
    "we give an explicit expression for their symbols in terms of the first fundamental form and the principal curvatures of the free surface .",
    "in particular , we show that , up to a positive invariant multiplier , the symbol of the operator @xmath210 is equal to @xmath211 , and the real part of the symbol of @xmath212 coincides with the difference between the sum of the principal curvatures and the normal curvature of @xmath195 in the direction of @xmath213 .",
    "this leads to the interesting conclusion : _ the manifold @xmath195 is defined by its dirichlet - neumann operator up to translation and rotation of the embedding space_.    combining lemma [ changevar1 ] and theorem [ thmdir - neum ] gives the main result of section 3  theorem [ thmchangecoord ] .",
    "this theorem ensures the existence of a diffeomorphism @xmath204 of the @xmath183-dimensional torus , which brings the linearized operator to the canonical form @xmath214 where the remainder @xmath215 is of order @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 are zero - order pseudodifferential operators , and the principal part @xmath219 is a selfadjoint pseudodifferential operator . here",
    "the parameter @xmath220 depends on the point of linearization , with @xmath221 ( lemma [ lemcoef - nu ] ) .",
    "in section 4 we study the operator @xmath222 in many details , and give estimates on its resolvent in sobolev spaces of bi - periodic functions which are odd in @xmath223 , and even in @xmath224 .",
    "we begin with the observation that for @xmath225 and almost every positive @xmath226 , zero is a simple eigenvalue of the operator @xmath227 and @xmath228 for all @xmath62 orthogonal to the kernel of @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "next we study the perturbation of its resolvent assuming that @xmath231 and with a spectral parameter @xmath232 , both being lipschitz functions of a small parameter @xmath233 . here",
    "we have a _ small divisor _ problem , and we meet the necessity to restrict the parameter values to `` good ones '' , for being able to find suitable estimates .",
    "calculations ( lemma [ 145l ] ) show that the resolvent of @xmath222 satisfies the estimate @xmath234 if parameters @xmath220 and @xmath235 satisfy the quadratic diophantine inequalities @xmath236 where @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "note that there is a difference between linear and polynomial diophantine approximations : in classic theory of linear diophantine forms , see @xcite for general theory , the integers for which `` small divisors '' are really small , form a sparse set in the integral lattice .",
    "this property was used in pioneering works of siegel @xcite and in the arnold proof of the kolmogorov theorem @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the linear case , the couples @xmath239 , for which the left hand side of inequality is small , can form clusters in @xmath240 , and the problem of obtaining small divisors estimates becomes more complicated .",
    "it turns out that the validity of inequalities with a constant @xmath4 independent of the small parameter is a consequence of estimate @xmath241 recall that , by the weil theorem @xcite , @xcite , for each fixed @xmath233 , the left hand side tends to @xmath233 as @xmath242 .",
    "hence the inequality holds true for some @xmath4 depending on @xmath233 . in appendix [ numbers ] we make this result more precise and prove the existence of absolute constant @xmath4 such that inequality is fulfilled for all @xmath243 and all intervals of length @xmath233 .",
    "this leads to the main result of this section  theorem [ 142 t ] , which shows that with a suitable choice of the parameters , the resolvent operator provides a loss of one in the degree of differentiability .",
    "moreover , estimate holds true for all @xmath244 in an asymptotically full measure set on every half line @xmath245 of the parameter plane , the origin of which being chosen arbitrarily in a full measure set , on the bifurcation curve @xmath246 .    in section 5",
    "we take into account all remaining terms of the linear operator @xmath247 and prove its invertibility with a loss of differentiability .",
    "the main difficulty is that the operator @xmath248 involves the principal part @xmath249 , which inverse is unbounded , and arbitrary operators @xmath217 , @xmath218 with `` variable coefficients '' .",
    "most , if not all , existing results related to such problems were obtained by use of _ the fr \" ohlich - spencer method _ proposed in @xcite , cf @xcite , and developed by craig and wayne @xcite and bourgain @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the method is a representation of operators in the form of infinite matrices with elements labelled by some lattice and block decompositions of this lattice .",
    "let us use the operator @xmath248 to illustrate the main features of this method .",
    "first we have to replace a periodic function @xmath62 by the sequence of its fourier coefficients @xmath250 , @xmath251 , and the operator @xmath222 by the diagonal matrix with the elements @xmath252",
    ". then we have to split the lattice @xmath253 into a `` regular '' part which consists of all @xmath122 with `` large '' @xmath252 , and an `` irregular '' part which includes all @xmath122 corresponding to `` small '' values of @xmath252 . using the contraction mapping principle",
    "we can eliminate the `` regular '' component and reduce the inversion of @xmath248 to the inversion of an infinite matrix on the `` irregular '' subspace .",
    "the existence of an inverse to this matrix is established by using a special iteration process which is the core of the method .",
    "note that the fr \" ohlich - spencer method is working in our case only if @xmath254 .",
