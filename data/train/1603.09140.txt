    "hybrid systems of metal nano - particles ( mnp ) and molecular quantum emitters have attracted increased attention in the last two decades @xcite . in particular , nonlinear effects , related to the quantum nature of ( surface ) plasmons , i.e. collective oscillation of conductance band electrons in the mnp offer interesting lasing effects in the so - called plasmonic nano - laser @xcite . rather than the radiation mode in a normal laser cavity ,",
    "the plasmonic nano - laser utilizes a confined plasmon oscillation .",
    "since the size of the nano - laser can be much smaller than the wavelength of the light generated by the plasmon , the optical diffraction limit restricting the size of conventional laser does not apply for the plasmonic nano - laser @xcite .",
    "the rapid damping of plasmon excitations impedes the achievement of plasmonic lasing @xcite unless many quantum emitters concertedly transfer their energy to the mnp .",
    "these quantum emitters should , in turn be excited , e.g. , by optical pumping @xcite or by electrical injection @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    ", we proposed several approaches to describe the optically pumped plasmonic nano - laser , noting that the analyses can be readily extended to the electrically pumped nano - laser @xcite .    to compensate the plasmon damping and to realize strong plasmon excitation",
    ", we can either increase the excitation strength or the number of quantum emitters .",
    "the increased strength raises the excited state probability of the emitters , which enables them to transfer energy more efficiently to the mnp .",
    "however , it may be hard to realize in experiments with a single emitter .",
    "if we turn to many quantum emitters , their mutual coupling can lead to the formation of exciton states , which may have different transition energies compared to that of the isolated quantum emitters , i.e. inhomogeneous broadening @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the energy transfer from the quantum emitters to the mnp plasmon becomes inefficient , and the coupling to other plasmon modes may occur , which further complicates the situation @xcite .    in this work",
    "we aim to prove the principle of plasmonic lasing with an idealized system , where many identical and non - interacting quantum emitters couple with one plasmon mode .",
    "this ideal system has been studied with non - linear rate equations @xcite , with a fokker - planck equation @xcite as well as with a reduced density matrix equation ( rdm ) @xcite . in most studies ,",
    "the quantum emitters are treated as two - level systems incoherently driven by an effective pump .",
    "although this effective description can capture the main physics of the systems , it is unable to describe the real experiments .",
    "for example , the optical pumping utilized in ref .",
    "@xcite relies on two processes : a laser excitation of the quantum emitters to a higher excited state and a subsequent decay to a lower excited state .",
    "the electrical injection applied in ref .",
    "@xcite also requires the participation of intermediate electron states .    to go beyond the effective description ,",
    "the theories developed so - far should be extended and the quantum emitters should be treated as multi - levels systems . fortunately , the theory presented in @xcite can be easily extended to three - level systems .",
    "such an extension will be elaborated in the present article .",
    "in particular , the numerical exact method to solve rdm equations , which was initially proposed by m. richter and a. knorr in @xcite for many identical two - levels systems coupled to a cavity or plasmon mode , can be easily extended to the case of many identical multi - levels systems .",
    "this method actually provides another way to solve the dissipative cavity - qed problem without using dicke states @xcite and therefore can be utilized to study many related problems , for example , sub - radiance and super - radiance @xcite , lasing @xcite , and collective behavior of spin - ensembles @xcite .    in the present article",
    ", we apply the extended theory to an electrically pumped molecular junction , cf .",
    "fig.[fig : scheme_moljunmnp](a ) , and demonstrate that a laser with electrically pumped dye molecules is theoretially possible .",
    "our study may also contribute to the exploration of plasmon lasers with an electrically pumped organic semiconductor layer , cf .",
    "fig.[fig : scheme_moljunmnp](b ) .",
    "more processes are involved , for example interlayer electron - transfer , exciton formation etc . , and the modeling of such a structure is beyond the scope of the present article . if realized , however , this kind of laser may replace the relative expensive semiconductor laser and may thus have strong impact on the industry @xcite .    the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the model of the junction system . in sec . [ sec : general - approach ] , we present a general rdm approach to solve the system dynamics , the electric current signal and the optical emission spectrum .",
    "this approach was previously used to simulate junctions with up to 5 molecules in @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : approach - identical - molecules ] , we develop an approach for junctions with identical molecules , which all couple coherently to the plasmon mode but decay and decohere independently .",
    "the symmetry of the rdm is explored to drastically reduce the computational effort , and simulations are carried out for junctions with up to 10 molecules . in sec .",
    "[ sec : approach - plasmon - rdm ] , we eliminate the molecular degrees of freedom and introduce and solve an approximate master equation for the plasmon rdm , which readily applies for junctions with up to 50 molecules . in sec .",
    "[ sec : approach - rate - equations ] , we eliminate instead the plasmon state and obtain non - linear equations for the molecular rdm .",
    "this approach allows calculation of the mean plasmon number which we compare with the results obtained by the other methods .",
