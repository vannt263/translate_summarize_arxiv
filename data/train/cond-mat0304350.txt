    "theoretical investigation of anisotropic interacting metallic systems is specifically demanding through the possibility , even for isotropic interaction potentials , of the deformation of the fermi surface in these systems with respect to the underlying non - interacting fermi surface @xcite . for recent approaches to this problem",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and the references herein .",
    "building on recent work @xcite concerning the uniform metallic ground states ( gss ) of the conventional single - band hubbard hamiltonian @xcite for arbitrary spatial dimensions @xmath21 , in this work we consider similar states for _ arbitrary _ two - body interaction potentials ( provided only that these possess fourier transform ) corresponding to systems of fermions whose non - interacting energy dispersion @xmath6 can be both bounded ( as is the case for the single - band hubbard hamiltonian ) and unbounded from above ( as in the case of the free - fermion model where @xmath22 $ ] , in which @xmath23 stands for the fermion bare mass ) . our results , of which a number we have presented in the abstract , make explicit some of the fundamental differences between systems in which the interaction potential @xmath24 is of contact type , of strictly bounded and of unbounded range . following the general considerations leading to the equations defining @xmath0 , presented above , in this paper we deduce the most general expression for @xmath11 in the close vicinity of @xmath0 and for specific cases deal with this expression in considerable detail . amongst others ,",
    "we show that , in contrast with the case of the conventional single - band hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath11 can become smaller ( greater ) than @xmath19 for @xmath8 inside ( outside ) the fermi sea and infinitesimally close to @xmath0 , without infringing on the condition @xmath25 implied by the assumption of the stability of the gs of the system under consideration .",
    "this aspect is significant in that in cases where @xmath26 , by continuity @xmath17 is expected to be more suppressed for @xmath8 _ inside _ the fermi sea ( at least in the vicinity of @xmath0 ) in comparison with cases where @xmath27 , implying thus an increase in the contribution of the correlated kinetic energy @xmath28 to the gs total energy of the system under consideration ( see later ) . in this connection ,",
    "note that @xmath29 is equal to the total number @xmath30 of particles in the gs and therefore independent of the magnitude of the coupling constant of interaction .    for a number of reasons of contemporary interest",
    ", a reliable description of @xmath11 seems timely and desirable .",
    "foremost amongst these are investigations regarding the determination of the mechanism of superconductivity in the copper - oxide - based high - temperature superconducting materials ( hereafter referred to as _ cuprates _ or _ cuprate compounds _ ) ; for recent reviews see @xcite . both the earlier angle - resolved photoemission results @xcite ( see in particular fig .",
    "3(f ) herein ) and the recent in - plane optical - conductivity data concerning bi@xmath31sr@xmath31cacu@xmath31o@xmath32 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) reveal _ decrease _ in the in - plane kinetic energy of the system upon entering into the superconducting state , by an amount commensurate with the expected superconducting condensation energy .",
    "this aspect has been explicitly quantified in @xcite . ]",
    "a similar trend has been observed in the measured out - of - plane ( i.e. the @xmath33-axis ) optical conductivities of tl@xmath31ba@xmath31cuo@xmath34 , la@xmath35sr@xmath36cuo@xmath37 , and yba@xmath31cu@xmath38o@xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the ` interlayer tunnelling ' theory by anderson and co - workers @xcite ( see also @xcite ) ascribes the superconducting condensation energy wholly to the reduction in the _ kinetic _ energy of the cuprate compounds in consequence of the possibility of coherent inter - layer tunnelling of the _ paired _ electrons in the superconducting states , a process deemed infeasible in the normal states of these materials ( owing to the incoherent nature of the underlying single - particle excitations ) .",
    "although , among other things ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , the measured @xmath33-axis optical conductivity in tl@xmath31ba@xmath31cuo@xmath34 , la@xmath35sr@xmath36cuo@xmath37 , and yba@xmath31cu@xmath38o@xmath39 @xcite may be interpreted within the framework of the inter - layer tunnelling theory @xcite ( see however @xcite ) , some experiments @xcite appear @xcite ( see also @xcite ) not to support this theory ; see however @xcite , @xcite ( and @xcite ) .",
    "the significance to pairing of the _ in - plane _ kinetic - energy frustration in the normal states of the cuprate compounds has been put forward and established by the model considerations of hirsch and marsiglio @xcite and hirsch @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . ] assuming the sufficiency of the bcs variational wavefunction to describe the superconducting states of the cuprate compounds ( an assumption that has been widely anticipated ) , according to this assumption , the zero - temperature bcs occupation fraction @xmath40 ( see @xcite , chapter 3 and in particular fig .",
    "3.1 ) plays the same role as @xmath11 does in relation to the underlying normal gs . for completeness , within the framework of the conventional bcs theory , and at zero temperature , the @xmath11 pertaining to the normal gs coincides with the unit - step function , equal to unity for @xmath8 inside the fermi sea and to zero for @xmath8 outside .",
    "consequently , at zero temperature the bcs state accommodates a _ higher _ kinetic energy than the underlying uncorrelated normal gs ( for a quantitative consideration see   3.4 in @xcite ) .",
    "note in passing that chester s @xcite findings do _ not _ apply to a pairing , or reduced , hamiltonian such as the one employed in the conventional bcs theory . ]",
    "one readily observes that @xmath41 , with @xmath42 , in combination with the assumption of continuity of @xmath11 for @xmath8 inside the fermi sea and in the vicinity of @xmath0 , is tantamount to an excess kinetic energy in the normal gs of the underlying system in comparison with the kinetic energy in the paired state ( see the previous paragraph ) .    the above - indicated experimental results on the one hand and the feasibility of @xmath43 for the metallic states of fermions interacting through potentials of at least finite range on the other clearly signify the likelihood of the existence of a crucial relationship between the latter potentials and the unconventional properties of the metallic states of the cuprate compounds ( see also @xcite ) . in this connection it is relevant to mention that it has been rigorously shown @xcite that for @xmath44 the conventional single - band hubbard hamiltonian does _ not _ support @xmath45 long - range pairing order at non - zero temperatures , the superconducting order parameter in the cuprate compounds is generally considered to have the @xmath45 symmetry @xcite . note in passing that in practice the inter - planar coupling of the electronic degrees of freedom is capable of stabilizing a @xmath46-wave superconducting state at finite temperatures , such as obtained within the framework of the so - called ` cluster dynamical mean - field ' approximation @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "] an aspect strongly anticipated by earlier monte carlo results ( which incidentally also do _ not _ support extended @xmath47-wave pairing ) on finite systems @xcite .",
    "further , the view is increasingly gaining prominence that the long range of the coulomb potential , such as taken account of by means of a variety of ` extended ' hubbard ( and associated @xmath48 ) hamiltonians , plays a crucial role in stabilizing one from amongst a number of competing orders in the cuprate compounds over some relevant range of parameters .",
    "of these , one concerns the periodic ( but incommensurate with respect to the underlying lattice ) ordering of spin and charge ( also referred to as spin - charge _ stripes _ ; for general reviews see @xcite and the references herein ) , which appears to compete against macroscopic phase separation @xcite .",
    "this statement requires some qualification .",
    "macroscopic phase separation is believed not to concern the hubbard hamiltonian @xcite , but solely the hamiltonian . however , even for the hamiltonian the actual situation is not firmly established ; on the one hand , green - function monte carlo results ( concerning finite systems ) have been interpreted as implying phase separation at hole dopings and interaction strengths appropriate to the cuprate superconductors @xcite , while , on the other hand , subsequent numerical calculations @xcite based on ` density - matrix renormalization group ' ( dmrg ) method performed on larger systems have upheld the viewpoint that the ` stripes ' state would have a lower energy than the phase - separated state . in spite of these opposing observations",
    ", it is generally believed that the sensitivity of the results corresponding to the hamiltonian on such details as , for instance , the shape and size of the clusters on which computations are carried out does not warrant an _ a priori _ neglect of the long range of the coulomb interaction @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . later in this paper",
    "we shall discuss and document the significance of a non - contact - type interaction in accurately describing the normal liquid state of @xmath18he .",
    "using the experimental angle - resolved photoemission data it is possible to determine @xmath11 for @xmath8 in the vicinity of @xmath0 , as has been reported in @xcite for bi@xmath31sr@xmath31cacu@xmath31o@xmath32 ( bi2212 ) and bi@xmath31sr@xmath31cu@xmath49o@xmath50 ( bi2201 ) , in both the overdoped and the underdoped regime .",
    "in @xcite the fermi surface has been asserted as being the locus of the @xmath8 points at which , firstly , the ( experimental ) single - particle spectral function @xmath51 is peaked for @xmath52 and , secondly , @xmath11 takes the value @xmath19 ( see @xcite ) ; explicitly , in @xcite the authors introduced three criteria to be obeyed `` at a true fs [ fermi surface ] crossing '' , of which the second reads : `` ( 2 ) @xmath53 [ @xmath11 ] should be near 50% of its maximal value , or equivalently the maximal gradient point '' .",
    "elsewhere these workers stated : `` a fs [ fermi surface ] crossing should occur when @xmath53 loses about half of its maximum value ( excluding the background ) '' .",
    "as we indicate in the main text , these workers fixed the scale of the experimentally determined @xmath11 by identifying with unity the maximum value of the latter function over all the @xmath8 points probed experimentally . ] in @xcite the absolute value of @xmath11 is determined by equating with unity the maximum value achieved by the experimental @xmath11 , @xmath55 , a procedure which evidently adds uncertainty to the experimentally determined @xmath11 . as demonstrated in @xcite , and in view of the findings in the present work ,",
    "the requirement @xmath56 for @xmath20 is _ not _ justified in general ; for cases in which @xmath11 is discontinuous at @xmath57 , in the present context the value assigned to @xmath11 for @xmath58 is the arithmetic mean of @xmath59 for @xmath60 approaching @xmath8 from inside and outside the fermi sea .",
    "this mean value coincides with the zero - temperature _ limit _ of @xmath11 for @xmath57 @xcite . ]",
    "firstly , within the framework of the conventional single - band hubbard model , the latter is solely a _ necessary _ ( and _ not _ sufficient ) condition for metallic states to be fermi - liquid ( fl ) and , secondly , for metallic states of fermions interacting through potentials of non - zero range the condition @xmath56 for @xmath4 is _ not _ demanded even for fl metallic states . in the light of these and neglecting for the moment the above - mentioned uncertainty concerning the absolute values of the experimentally determined @xmath11 , the results depicted in fig",
    ".  2 of @xcite have far - reaching implications .",
    "for instance , these results clearly show that a contact - type interaction _ can not _ be capable of reliably describing bi2212 and bi2201 in the over - doped and the underdoped regimes ( at _ no _ peak position of @xmath61 does @xmath17 acquire a value reasonably close to @xmath19 ) ; a number of these results further show that the pertinent single - particle spectral functions @xmath62 , corresponding to the systems considered , are most probably free from quasi - particle @xmath63-function contributions ( establishing the breakdown of the fl state ) at regions of @xmath0 neighbouring the @xmath64 points of the underlying brillouin zones ( compare for instance figs .",

    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we introduce the hamiltonian on which the considerations in this paper are based ; this hamiltonian , which is expressed in terms of a single spin - degenerate energy dispersion @xmath6 , is defined on the continuum ; however , through some minor adjustments , which we explicitly specify , this reduces to the conventional single - band hubbard hamiltonian , defined on a lattice . in   3 we present the details underlying the equations from which @xmath0 pertaining to the uniform gss of the hamiltonian introduced in   2 is determined . in   4 we expose an intimate relationship between @xmath65 and @xmath2 mediated through the single - particle density matrix @xmath66 which for uniform gss , where the latter function depends on @xmath67 , coincides with the fourier transform of the gs momentum distribution function @xmath11 ; the information with regard to @xmath0 , through the singular nature of @xmath11 for @xmath20 ,",

    "rather , in considering the heavy - fermion compounds and superconductivity @xcite in these , one has in essence solely relied on the so - called ` almost - localized fermi - liquid ' picture @xcite of the charge carriers ; the latter has its root in the brinkman - rice @xcite scenario concerning the nature of the metallic states of the hubbard hamiltonian ( for @xmath348 ) at half - filling for the on - site @xmath88 approaching from below a critical value @xmath851 , for which , according to the gutzwiller _",

    "finally , insofar as the _ normal _ states of the heavy - fermion compounds are concerned , although the considerations in @xcite are based on the gutzwiller ansatz ( together with the gutzwiller approximation ) for the gs wavefunction of the hubbard hamiltonian , the work in @xcite , based on the periodic anderson hamiltonian , leaves no doubt that the analogies proposed in @xcite have indeed been based on `` intuitive grounds '' . ]",
    "since for the ( correlated ) gs kinetic energy we have @xmath853 , by continuity it follows that in general the gs kinetic energy of systems in which @xmath43 , @xmath475 , exceeds that of comparable systems in which @xmath849 ( note that @xmath854 and @xmath855 , independent of interaction ) .",
    "we thus observe a direct relationship between the range of the two - body interaction potential and the magnitude of the corresponding gs kinetic energy , with the latter tending to increase ( in the manner specified above ) in consequence of increasing the range of the interaction potential .",
    "the existence of such a direct relationship between the range of the interaction potential and the value of the gs kinetic energy should be of relevance to a better understanding of the physics of the cuprate superconductors for which there is growing evidence indicating that in the normal state the kinetic - energy contribution to the gs total energy is relatively larger than in conventional metals and that superconductivity in the former is driven by a consequent decrease in the kinetic energy of these systems upon entering into the superconducting state . in the light of this and of our theoretical finding , we believe that any theoretical modelling of in particular the cuprate compounds is required to take account of the non - zero range of the interparticle interaction potential .",
    "in addition to establishing the above - mentioned impact that a non - zero range of interaction has on the behaviour of @xmath11 in the vicinity of @xmath0 , we have explicitly exposed (   6 ) some distinctive features associated with the actual range of the interaction potential ; that is whether this range is sharply limited to a finite inter - particle distance or it extents to arbitrary large distances .",
    "for instance , for interaction potentials @xmath856 that possess power - law decay for @xmath857 , the singular behaviour of @xmath11 in the neighbourhood of any @xmath8 directly implies a singular behaviour in the fock part @xmath858 of the self - energy in the neighbourhood of the same @xmath8 ; the two singularities are , however , of different types .",
    "this observation is specifically significant for the @xmath8 points in the neighbourhood of @xmath0 , where @xmath11 is unconditionally singular ( and not necessarily discontinuous ) . from our considerations it follows that , for systems of fermions interacting through a potential @xmath24 decaying , for instance , like @xmath859 for @xmath860 , a discontinuity in @xmath11 at a _",
