    "the quasilinear diffusion equation in its original form ( qlt1 ) was a fokker - planck equation describing the velocity - space diffusion of particles due to random scattering by waves . in the absence of the waves",
    "the plasma was assumed to be infinite and homogeneous so that the unperturbed motion was rectilinear .",
    "the diffusion equation was derived @xcite from the vlasov equation by solving for the perturbed part of the distribution function , in the linear approximation and assuming the unperturbed distribution function to be essentially constant over the timescale of wave - particle interaction , then substituting back into the full vlasov equation and averaging over position ( or , equivalently , over the random phases of the waves ) .    to put this formalism in a more general perspective",
    ", it is advantageous to cast it in hamiltonian form , with the particle motion in the absence of waves being described by an unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "the total single - particle hamiltonian is then @xmath3 , with the waves being incorporated in the perturbation hamiltonian @xmath2 . in qlt1 ,",
    "all stochasticity comes from the assumption of random phases in the assumed broad spectrum of waves in @xmath2 .",
    "the smallness parameter @xmath4 expresses the assumption that the amplitudes of individual waves are small , so that the short - time - scale perturbations to the distribution function can be derived using linear , @xmath5 theory ( hence the terminology `` quasilinear '' ) .",
    "the only nonlinear effect is the long - time diffusion described by the diffusion coefficient , which is @xmath6 .",
    "it is not really necessary to assume an infinite , homogeneous plasma .",
    "the essence of qlt1 is the assumption that @xmath1 is _ integrable _ , so that a canonical transformation to action - angle coordinates exists .",
    "then the unperturbed motion in angle space is rectilinear , just as that in coordinate space in the case of a homogeneous medium .",
    "this action - angle generalization was carried out by kaufman @xcite and by hazeltine _",
    "@xcite to derive a quasilinear diffusion equation ( in action space ) for wave - particle scattering in axisymmetric toroidal magnetic confinement geometries ( e.g. tokamaks ) .",
    "the formalism has been used , for example @xcite , to investigate the effect of a sheared radial electric field on anomalous transport in a tokamak .    with the development of the theory of hamiltonian chaos it has come to be realized that a quasilinear diffusion equation can also be derived in cases where @xmath2 represents the effect of a _ coherent _ wave , provided the interaction of @xmath1 and @xmath2 produces a chaotic motion .",
    "we call this form of quasilinear theory qlt2 , and it is very useful in the theory of radio - frequency ( rf ) and microwave heating of plasmas @xcite because this is typically done with coherent waves .",
    "again , @xmath1 is assumed integrable so that an action - angle transformation exists . in these theories",
    "the _ perturbation _ is still the source of chaos ( `` intrinsic stochasticity '' ) , which causes the action variables , constructed in the integration of @xmath1 , to perform the random walk described by the quasilinear diffusion equation . assuming the hessian matrix @xmath7 to be nonsingular ,",
    "the coherent perturbation must exceed a certain amplitude for global resonance overlap , and hence chaos , to occur @xcite .",
    "thus , paradoxically , a criterion for qlt2 to apply is that the system be sufficiently nonlinear !    in the present paper we examine a third form of quasilinear theory , which we call qlt3 .",
    "this case is the complete obverse of the original quasilinear diffusion problem : we now assume the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath1 to be completely nonintegrable , giving rise to strongly chaotic motion in the _ unperturbed _ system .",
    "the chaotic dynamics of the unperturbed hamiltonian system then provides randomization and allows the application of a quasilinear formalism to derive the diffusion equation for the distribution function .",
    "of course , since @xmath1 is not integrable , an action - angle representation does not exist .",
    "in fact we assume @xmath1 to be so strongly chaotic that the unperturbed motion covers essentially the entire energy surface @xmath8 ergodically , except as restricted by integrals of the motion associated with any continuous symmetries of @xmath1 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to determine the diffusion in @xmath9 caused by the time - dependent perturbation @xmath2 .",
    "since the unperturbed motion provides the source of stochasticity ( with no threshold ) , we can , as in qlt2 , assume the perturbation to be coherent .",
    "thus the theory is applicable to wave heating of plasmas in strongly nonintegrable magnetic confinement geometries .",
    "the assumption of uncorrelated gyrophase in successive passes through the resonance region is often made in the derivation of a quasilinear diffusion equation to describe cyclotron resonance heating of magnetically confined plasmas . however , in simple confinement geometries , such as magnetic mirrors , @xmath1 is essentially integrable owing to the existence of the adiabatic invariant @xmath10 and another integral due to symmetry , or a second adiabatic invariant .",
    "lichtenberg and lieberman @xcite have analyzed collisionless heating in such systems using area - preserving maps , and find the random phase assumption to be valid only well beyond the nonlinear threshold where the last invariant circle is destroyed and chaotic motion becomes global . in our nomenclature ,",
    "quasilinear diffusion in these systems is an example of qlt2 , not qlt3 .    on the other hand , in systems with a null in the magnetic field @xmath10",
    "is not globally conserved and the situation is rather different from that in the much - studied mirror systems .",
    "for instance , yoshida _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have recently studied rf heating in a two - dimensional slab model with a neutral line , where @xmath10 conservation is broken .",
    "they find heating due to the onset of chaos at finite amplitude of the perturbing field .",
    "however , their unperturbed system has two symmetry directions , and thus their @xmath1 is integrable , despite the breaking of the adiabatic invariant .",
    "thus their model must be classified as a qlt2 case also .    in systems with a null in the magnetic field and only _ one _ symmetry direction , however , @xmath1 is not in general integrable . an important class of such systems are the magnetic cusp confinement geometries , which are much used in low - temperature plasma physics due to the ease with which they can be created with arrays of permanent magnets @xcite@xcite . in this paper",
    "we give evidence that they fulfill the criterion for systems of type qlt3 in that their unperturbed dynamics is almost completely chaotic .",
    "we know from the work of sinai @xcite that particle motion on a billiard table with a convex boundary is a strongly chaotic system due to the defocussing effect of each collision with this boundary . in fact",
    "sinai showed the motion to be strongly mixing , so that ergodic theory could be applied .",
    "this suggests that cusp confinement systems , where magnetic fields lie on surfaces that are convex toward the plasma , are strongly chaotic . indeed the four - cusp hamiltonian @xmath11 was at one time conjectured to be completely chaotic like a sinai billiard .",
    "although dahlqvist and russberg @xcite disproved this conjecture by finding a stable periodic orbit , they found that the island of stability surrounding this orbit was extremely small , so for practical purposes one can assume that the energetically accessible phase space is covered ergodically in this system .",
    "in this paper we study a magnetic field configuration consisting of a `` picket fence '' of infinite linear magnetic dipoles , producing multiple line cusps .",
    "this can be regarded as a simplified model for a low - temperature plasma source , created using arrays of permanent magnets @xcite .",
    "it is also a rather simple model , in which the unperturbed dynamics can be simplified analytically to a considerable extent by the use of complex variable theory .    in the limit of a large number of dipoles the interior of the plasma is essentially free of magnetic field and the unperturbed motion is rectilinear in the interior region , while near the edge of the confinement region , a particle can be reflected over a range of angles .",
    "thus we might expect the configuration to approximate a chaotic billiard problem .",
    "( in the original sinai problem the convex boundary was in the interior of the domain , whereas the billiard analog of the present example has an outer boundary that is convex except for cusps , like the `` bow - tie '' billiard shown in fig .",
    "7.24(e ) of ref .  @xcite . )    the problem is also related to a model originally proposed by fermi @xcite for explaining the acceleration of cosmic rays to the extraordinarily high energies observed . in the fermi model",
    "the cosmic ray particles move rectilinearly except during occasional collisions with moving magnetized clouds of gas , which cause diffusion in energy space .",
    "the present model includes both the possibility of cyclotron - resonance heating in the mirror - like cusp regions and nonresonant heating of particles reflected without penetrating deeply into the cusps .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the behavior of a sufficiently dilute plasma can be analyzed on the basis of single - particle motion in magnetic and electric fields made up of an externally imposed component and an internally generated component produced by the collective currents and charges from the combined effect of many otherwise noninteracting particles . in this paper",
    "we suppose that the self - consistent component is negligible and analyze single - particle motion in an imposed magnetic field .",
