    "<S> advances in the development of free - electron lasers offer the realistic prospect of high - resolution imaging to study the nanoworld on the time - scale of atomic motions . </S>",
    "<S> we identify x - ray fourier transform holography@xcite , ( fth ) as a promising but , so far , inefficient scheme to do this . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a uniformly redundant array@xcite ( ura ) placed next to the sample , multiplies the efficiency of x - ray fth by more than one thousand ( approaching that of a perfect lens ) and provides holographic images with both amplitude- and phase - contrast information . the experiments reported here demonstrate this concept by imaging a nano - fabricated object at a synchrotron source , and a bacterial cell at a soft x - ray free - electron - laser , where illumination by a single 15 fs pulse was successfully used in producing the holographic image . </S>",
    "<S> we expect with upcoming hard x - ray lasers to achieve considerably higher spatial resolution and to obtain ultrafast movies of excited states of matter .    ,    the ideal microscope for the life and physical sciences should deliver high - spatial - resolution high - speed snapshots possibly with spectral , chemical and magnetic sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> x - rays can provide a large penetration depth , fast time resolution , and strong absorption contrast across elemental absorption edges . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry of fourier transform holography is particularly suited to x - ray imaging as the resolution is determined by the scattering angle , as in crystallography . the problem with conventional fourier holography is an unfavourable trade off between intensity and resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we show here how recent technical developments in lensless flash photography can be used to reduce this effect .        around the @xmath0 century </S>",
    "<S> , european painters used the camera obscura , a dark camera with a pinhole to form an image on a canvas . </S>",
    "<S> even earlier , pinhole cameras had been used to image solar eclipses by chinese , arab and european scientists . </S>",
    "<S> scientists and painters knew that a small pinhole was required for reaching high resolution , but the small pinhole also dimmed the light and the image@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was eventually discovered that lenses could collect a larger amount of light without degrading resolution . </S>",
    "<S> shutters and stroboscopic flash illumination allowed recording of the time evolution of the image . </S>",
    "<S> the development of the computer allowed a resurgence of pinhole techniques and random arrays of pinholes were used , initially in x - ray astronomy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> each bright point of a scene deposits a shadow - image of the pinhole array on the viewing screen . </S>",
    "<S> depth information about the object is encoded in the scaling of the shadow image of the object points@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> knowledge of the geometry of the pinhole array ( the `` coded aperture '' ) allowed numerical recovery of the image . </S>",
    "<S> eventually the pinholes were replaced by binary uras which were shown to be optimal for imaging@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their multitudes of sharp features contain equal amounts of all possible spatial frequencies , thereby allowing high spatial resolution without sacrifice of image brightness . </S>",
    "<S> ura coded apertures are now commonly used in hard x - ray astronomy@xcite , medical imaging@xcite , plasma research@xcite , homeland security@xcite and spectroscopy@xcite to improve brightness where lenses are not applicable .    </S>",
    "<S> the forerunner of our x - ray holography with a ura reference source is conventional visible - light fth @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interference pattern between light scattered by an object and light from a nearby pinhole is recorded far downstream ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . when this recording ( the hologram ) is re - illuminated by the pinhole reference wave , the hologram diffracts the wavefront so as to produce an image of the object . </S>",
    "<S> a second inverted ( `` twin '' ) copy of the object is produced on the opposite side of the optical axis . under far - field measurement conditions , </S>",
    "<S> a simple inverse - fourier transform of the fth recording produces an image of the specimen convolved with the reference pinhole source . as in the pinhole image of the camera obscura , the brightness of the image ( or equivalently </S>",
    "<S> , the signal to noise ratio ) increases as the reference pinhole increases in size , at the expense of image resolution .    in general the solution to </S>",
    "<S> the problem of weak signal from a single pinhole ( and resulting long exposure time ) is to use multiple reference sources . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a unique mesoscale object has been imaged by x - ray fth using 5 pinholes sources@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> no two pairs of pinholes were the same distance apart , so that each holographic term could be isolated in the autocorrelation map . </S>",
    "<S> this geometry blocks much of the available light and limits the number of pixels available to image the specimen . hitherto efforts to produce strong signal have been pursued using complicated reference objects@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the possible improvement in signal to noise of fourier - transform holograms with a strong reference saturates@xcite at 50% of that for an ideal lens - based amplitude image with loss of phase information . </S>",
    "<S> however there is still the difficulty of deconvolution due to the missing frequency content of the reference . </S>",
    "<S> the flat power spectrum of the ura is designed to optimize the reference to fill the detector with light uniformly . in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the optimum method of boosting the holographic signal is to use a ura as the reference object . </S>",
    "<S> the gain in flux compared to a single pinhole is the number of the opaque elements in the ura ( twice as much for phase uras ) , in our case , n=2592 and n=162 . the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of the ura - produced image increases initially with the square root of the number of pixels in the ura@xcite ( see methods ) , in our case by a factor of 18 and 4.5 for n=2592 and n=162 respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray fth experiment is conceptually simple : a coherent beam of x - rays impinges on a specimen and the coded array , and the diffraction pattern is recorded far downstream ( fig 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we report here two experiments both using an area detector fitted to an existing experimental end station@xcite , and already used in several recent coherent x - ray diffractive imaging experiments@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first experiment was carried out at beam line 9.0.1 at the advanced light source ( als ) at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> an x - ray beam defined using a 4 @xmath1 m coherence - selecting pinhole was used to image a test object placed next to a 44 nm resolution array ( figure 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the flux advantage of the ura method is illustrated by the calculations shown in figs . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig:2 ] , scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the second series of experiments was carried out at the flash soft x - ray free electron laser ( @xmath2=13.5 nm ) in hamburg . </S>",
    "<S> a 15 fs pulse of @xmath4 photons traverses the sample and ura , and is diffracted just before they both turn into a hot plasma@xcite , and become vapourised . </S>",
    "<S> a bacterium was imaged to demonstrate that the experiment was feasible with the lower scattering strength of biological material ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> more information on these experiments is given in the figure captions and methods section .    </S>",
    "<S> in fth , the final image is produced by an especially simple one - step calculation . </S>",
    "<S> a fourier transformation of the measured intensity pattern delivers the autocorrelation of the wavefield that exits the object plane . in standard fth with a point reference source </S>",
    "<S> such an autocorrelation would already contain the image . </S>",
    "<S> for fth with a ura reference source , it includes the convolution of the object and the ura . </S>",
    "<S> positioning the sample and the array with a sufficient spacing between them ensures that this information - containing term will be separated from the autocorrelations of the array and the object . to extract the final image , </S>",
    "<S> we convolved the holographic term ( with the rest of the autocorrelation map set to zero ) using a mosaic of @xmath5 uras , that is using the same delta - hadamard transform used to reconstruct the pinhole camera image intensities , but replacing the intensity image with the complex valued cross correlation term . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstructed images made by this method are shown in figure 2 using 44-nm ura elements . </S>",
    "<S> the forward or small angle scattering was discarded during data collection , yielding edge enhancement in the image . for the biological image additional refinement was demonstrated . by using the fourier - hadamard - transform image provided by a 150 nm resolution ura as the starting point for a phase retrieval algorithm , we refined the 15-fs flash image of a small helical bacterium ( spiroplasma melliferum ) to the full extent of the recorded diffraction pattern at half the pinhole - size resolution ( 75 nm ) ( fig . 3 and methods section ) .    </S>",

    "<S> ( b ) diffraction pattern collected at flash in a single 15 fs ( @xmath2=13.5 nm ) pulse . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) reconstructed image by phase retrieval methods@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) the reproducibility of the recovered image as a function of spatial frequency drops at 75 nm resolution . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] , scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the resolution of the holograms corresponds to the resolution of the fabricated uras : 44 nm for the lithographic pattern used at als , and 150 nm ( refined to 75 nm ) for the bacterium used at flash . </S>",
    "<S> these values are among the best ever reported for holography of a one - micron - sized object , and we believe resolution will improve in the future with the development of nano - arrays . uras with 25 nm resolution and 9522 elements have already been produced by conventional methods .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have successfully demonstrated holographic x - ray imaging with uras and obtained amplified x - ray holographic images at attractive resolutions . </S>",
    "<S> these images were orders of magnitude more intense than those from conventional fourier transform holography , enabling the potential use of novel tabletop sources@xcite . since ura diffraction uniformly filled the detector with light , image reconstruction could be performed by a fourier - hadamard transform in a single step without iterations . </S>",
    "<S> the technique shows good prospects for improvements in the spatial resolution , and the results verify the predicted high performance values with respect to high brightness and ultrafast time resolution . </S>",
    "<S> imaging with coherent x - rays will be a key technique for developing nanoscience and nanotechnology , and or massively parallel holography will be an enabling tool in this quest .    </S>",
