    "the physics of the high - t@xmath0 cuprates is unusual and fascinating for a number of reasons . in this work",
    "we explore two of them : the symmetry of the superconducting pairing state and the existence of the pseudogap state between the insulator and the superconductor .    in recent years",
    "the experimental evidence has become overwhelming that the cuprate high - t@xmath0 superconductors possess an anisotropic @xmath2-wave pairing state@xcite .",
    "angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments @xcite and measurements of the temperature dependence of the penetration depth @xcite both strongly support this scenario , but perhaps the most convincing evidence comes from the elegant measurements of wollman _",
    "et al._@xcite and of tsuei _",
    "et al._@xcite since they do not depend on the microscopic physics of the energy gap , but instead depend only on the order parameter phase .",
    "whilst there is a consensus on the @xmath2-wave nature of the dominant part of the order parameter , there is continuing controversy over the possible existence of a sub - dominant @xmath1-wave contribution @xcite .",
    "the existence , or otherwise , of a subdominant @xmath1-wave component has profound consequences for the nature of the microscopic pairing mechanism .",
    "for example , antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations lead to attraction in the @xmath4 pairing channel , but are pair breaking in the @xmath1-wave channel @xcite .",
    "similarly the hubbard model with a positive ( repulsive ) on - site interaction u may have a @xmath4 paired ground state , but would presumably not support @xmath1-wave cooper pairs . in the case of yba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7",
    "the orthorhombic crystal symmetry makes some non - zero @xmath1-wave component inevitable , but a large @xmath1-wave component would be difficult to reconcile with either of these pairing mechanisms . on the other hand , pairing mechanisms based on electron - phonon interactions , polarons , or other non - magnetic excitations ( e.g. excitons , acoustic plasmons ) could be compatible with either @xmath1-wave or @xmath2-wave pairing states @xcite . in these models ,",
    "whether @xmath1-wave , @xmath2-wave or mixed pairs are more strongly favoured would depend on details of the model parameters , and could even vary from compound to compound .",
    "indeed there is some evidence that the n - type cuprate superconductors are @xmath1-wave@xcite ( or at least they have no zeros in the gap @xmath8 on the fermi surface ) .",
    "this would imply that either the pairing mechanism is different for the n- and p - type materials , or that the mechanism allows both @xmath1-wave or @xmath2-wave ground states depending on the band filling .",
    "the second remarkable feature of the cuprates is the `` pseudogap '' occuring in underdoped materials .",
    "transport experiments @xcite , arpes @xcite , nmr @xcite , and optical conductivity @xcite all detect a loss of spectral weight at low energies in the one - particle excitation spectrum below a certain temperature , @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath10-specific nature of the arpes technique has shown that the pseudogap has nodes at the same places as the superconducting gap .",
    "these data and the fact that the coherence length is known to be very small in the cuprates ( @xmath11  in the cuo@xmath5 planes ) points to a strong - coupling scenario in which superconducting fluctuations play a major role .",
    "although there is as yet no concensus on the exact nature of the fluctuations , it is generally believed that the opening of the pseudogap at t@xmath12 is due to the formation of an incoherent pairing state above t@xmath0 .",
    "two competing scenarios have emerged to explain this phenomenon . in the first , exemplified by the work of emery and kivelson @xcite , the relevant fluctuations are in the phase .",
    "the stiffness to the phase fluctuations is @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the zero temperature superfluid density and @xmath15 is the effective quasiparticle mass ) , and where this is small , such as in the underdoped cuprates , the true t@xmath0 , where phase coherence is established , can be well below the mean field transition temperature which is identified with t@xmath12 .",
    "the second scenario is best illustrated by the works of nozi ` eres and schmitt - rink @xcite ( which predates the discovery of the high - t@xmath0 compounds ) , dreschler and zwerger @xcite and s de melo , randeria and engelbrecht @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . by considering both magnitude and phase fluctuations in @xmath1-wave superconductors in the vicinity of the critical temperature",
    ", these authors examined the crossover from bcs - like superconductivity of weakly bound pairs to the bose condensation of tightly bound pairs as @xmath16 , the strength of the interaction , was varied .",
    "the results are summarised in fig .",
    "[ bcs_bose ] . for weak",
    "pairing the fluctuating and mean field theories are essentially the same .",
    "however as @xmath16 is increased large differences become apparent : whilst the mean field critical temperature , t@xmath17 , keeps getting larger , the effects of fluctuations cause the true t@xmath0 to flatten off , for the continuum model , or even to decrease in the case of the lattice model .",
    "the difference between t@xmath17 and t@xmath0 gives an estimate for the regime where fluctuations dominate and may correspond to the pseudogap regime in which bosonic pairs exist but are not condensed into a superfluid .",
    "in this paper we will address both the pairing symmetry and the fluctuation issues in a systematic way .",
    "we broadly follow the functional integral approach taken by dreschler and zwerger @xcite and s de melo , randeria and engelbrecht @xcite , but explicitly including @xmath2-wave pairing . in section [ sect_lgw ]",
    "we introduce the attractive nearest neighbour hubbard model as a simple phenomenological model of the cuprates and derive from it a landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) functional describing @xmath1- and @xmath2-wave superconducting fields . in section [ sect_mft ]",
    "we examine the bsc - like mean field theory of the model by finding the saddle point solutions of the lgw functional which show @xmath1- and @xmath2-wave and mixed symmetry phases .",
    "finally , in section [ sect_gfa ] , we include gaussian fluctuations about the saddle point in order to study the strong coupling bosonic limit .",
    "this limit is especially interesting in this model because of the competition between preformed pairs of different symmetries .",
    "we also comment on the symmetry and origin of the pseudogap .",
    "to investigate the symmetry of the order parameter and the nature of the bosonic limit for anisotropic pairs , we consider a simple phenomenological model of the cuprates , the attractive nearest neighbour hubbard model on a 2d square lattice .",
    "it is the simplest model that allows @xmath1-wave , @xmath2-wave or mixed symmetry pairing states to occur .",
    "its hamiltonian is , @xmath18 where @xmath19 contains the chemical potential and a nearest neighbour hopping term .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian describes an electron - electron attraction on nearest neighbour sites : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes summation over all of the bonds between the nearest neighbour sites . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we do not include an on - site interaction term .    in order to investigate the thermodynamics of this model",
    "it is sufficient to consider the partition function . in the coherent state functional integral representation",
    "it is , @xmath22      \\;e^{{\\cal s}},\\\\ { \\cal s } & = & \\int_{0}^{\\beta}d\\tau\\ ;      \\bigg [          \\sum_{i\\sigma }                    c^{\\dagger}_{i\\sigma}(\\tau )                   \\left (                      -\\partial_\\tau                  \\right )                   c^{}_{i\\sigma}(\\tau )          - h(c^{\\dagger},c )      \\bigg ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the grassmannian counterparts to the fermi operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "unfortunately , the interaction part of the hamiltonian is quartic in the grassmann ( fermion ) fields so the functional integral can not be evaluated exactly . however , by using the hubbard - stratonovi transformation @xcite the quartic problem of interacting electrons can be converted to the more tractable quadratic problem of non - interacting electrons coupled to a random ( gaussian weighted ) bose field . in order to make this transformation",
    ", the electronic hamiltonian must first be decomposed into a product of fermionic bilinears .",
    "this can be done in a number of different ways , but the purpose of this paper is to study superconductivity so we choose what might be called the gorkov decomposition in terms of pairing operators : @xmath27 with the pairing matrix written as , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the vector of pauli matrices , and @xmath30 the scalars , @xmath31 , are even under both time reversal and parity whilst the vectors , @xmath32 , are odd under both . in the manner of volovik and gorkov @xcite , we interpret @xmath31 and @xmath33 as the annihilation operators for singlet and triplet cooper pairs on the bonds @xmath34 . in terms of these operators",
    "the interaction hamiltonian becomes : @xmath35 where we have used tr@xmath36 and tr@xmath37 .",
    "although it would be interesting to study triplet superconductivity , especially in light of the exciting recent discovery @xcite of @xmath38-wave pairing in strontium ruthenate , sr@xmath5ruo@xmath39 , the focus of this work is on anisotropic _ singlet _ pairing as seen in the high - t@xmath0 cuprates .",
    "therefore , for the sake of simplicity , we restrict our attention to the singlet fields .",
    "having decomposed the interaction hamiltonian into a product of fermionic bilinears we make the hubbard - stratonovi transformation .",
    "tensor valued bose fields , @xmath40 , are introduced conjugate to the fermion bilinears , @xmath31 .",
    "( had we kept the triplet operators we would have needed to introduce an additional vector of triplet pairing fields , @xmath41 . ) in terms of these the partition function becomes , @xmath42          \\;e^{s } , \\\\",

    "however , it is generally more convenient to work with site - centred combinations possessing a definite symmetry . on a square lattice , every site , @xmath45 , has two fields associated with it , one in the @xmath46-direction and one in the @xmath47-direction .",
    "( we could associate four fields with each point but that introduces problems with double counting . ) rather than talk about @xmath46- and @xmath47-bond fields , it is natural to form linear combinations of them : @xmath48 where @xmath49 for @xmath50 according to the direction of the bond @xmath34 .",
    "we call these the @xmath1- and @xmath2-wave fields because , in the spatially homogeneous limit , they become the order parameters for ( extended ) @xmath1- and @xmath2-wave superconductivity . unlike the @xmath46 and @xmath47 fields , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 order parameters transform as irreducible representations of the tetragonal crystallographic point group , @xmath51 . in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite they belong to the @xmath52 and @xmath53 representations of @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath2-wave representation , @xmath53 , corresponds to an order parameter with @xmath54 symmetry as seen in the cuprate materials .",
    "proceeding with the calculation , the action is diagonalised by the introduction of fourier transformed fields : @xmath55 in which @xmath56 [ @xmath57 where the fermion [ boson ] matsubara frequencies are @xmath58 [ @xmath59 .",

    "rearranging this equation gives an expression for t@xmath0 at fixed density : @xmath204 from this equation we can see the importance of the mass : a large mass means a low t@xmath0 and _ vice versa_. thus , for the large @xmath16 limit in which we are interested , increasing the coupling , which would `` normally '' ( i.e. , in mean field talk ) increase the critical temperature , has the paradoxical effect of lowering t@xmath0 due to the localising effect it has on the pairs .",
    "we expect to see analogous behaviour in our extended hubbard model as we increase the coupling , but instead of becoming localised on a site , our bosons should become localised on bonds , becoming more and more massive , i.e. , less mobile , as @xmath120 increases .",
    "the analysis for the extended hubbard model proceeds along similar lines as the on - site model but is complicated by the existence of two species of bosons , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , or , equivalently , @xmath205 and @xmath206 . in the large @xmath120 limit",
    "we find , @xmath207 for nearest neighbour hopping , these give the following bosonic masses : @xmath208 the anisotropy between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 boson masses arises because the form factors for the @xmath1- and @xmath2-wave bosons , @xmath209 and @xmath210 , differ by the sign on @xmath211 .",
    "( this term does not enter the @xmath212 cross term . )",
    "this is best understood in terms of the @xmath46 and @xmath47 fields .",
    "in that basis we see that the term comes from the process , shown in fig .",
    "[ xy_hopping](i ) , by which an @xmath46 field becomes a @xmath47 field .",
    "obviously such a process is sensitive to the relative phases of the two bonds : zero phase difference is optimal for the hopping to occur so the @xmath1-wave phase is preferred .    at this point",
    ", a pertinent question is , what happens if we change the bandstructure ? as an example , consider adding a next nearest neighbour hopping , @xmath213 , to the hamiltonian so that the band energy is , @xmath214 the diagonal hopping allows the @xmath91 process to occur without a potential energy cost : there is no intermediate state where @xmath120 is lost .",
    "see fig . [",
    "xy_hopping](ii )    in terms of the mathematics , the @xmath213 hopping means that the integrand for the @xmath215 term in the expansion of @xmath216 goes like @xmath217 which has the same sign over the whole range of integration and is therefore finite ( c.f .",
    "the nearest neighbour hopping contribution at this order which has only odd powers of @xmath218 and @xmath219 and therefore integrates to zero ) .",
    "the masses calculated with this term are : @xmath220 if the product @xmath221 is much smaller than @xmath222 the nearest neighbour hopping can be safely ignored . however ,",
    "if this is not the case then the corrections can be of great significance .",
    "for instance , if @xmath223 then the @xmath2-wave solution is unstable ( has negative mass ) , or if @xmath224 then the @xmath1-wave solution is unstable . in the limit",
    "@xmath225 only one flavour of boson is stable and its mass is _ independent of _ @xmath120 : @xmath226 including a sufficiently large diagonal hopping , @xmath213 , obviates the need for pair hopping to occur via virtual ionisation .",
    "once this requirement has been lifted , the lattice model behaves exactly as we would expect a continuum model to behave ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ bcs_bose ] ) .",
    "assuming for the moment that both boson modes are stable ( i.e. , @xmath227 or small ) we resume our calculation . the gaussian free energy is , @xmath228 where we have used the cyclic nature of the trace to diagonalise the action with respect to its flavour indices .",
    "the eigenvalues , @xmath229 , are the energies of the eigenmodes of the system which in general are linear combinations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( or @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) modes . in the large @xmath120 limit ,",
    "the eigenvalues are , @xmath230 where the masses , which depend on the angle @xmath231 , are , @xmath232 with @xmath233 as a convenient mass unit .    with these definitions",
    "the bosonic number density is , @xmath234 where the densities of the two modes , as functions of angle in @xmath200-space , are @xmath235 we see from this that for given @xmath175 and t@xmath0 , the mode with the largest mass will be the most populous .",
    "this is graphically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mass_theta ] which shows the relative contributions of the two masses to the angle - dependent density .",
    "the flavour of boson with the smaller of the two masses , @xmath236 , contributes negligibly ( @xmath237 ) to the total number density , therefore the physics is determined by the boson with the largest mass , @xmath238 . from fig .",
    "[ mass_theta ] we see that the @xmath238 bosons are not distributed evenly throughout space - they prefer to lie along one or other of the coordinate axes .",
    "relative to an isotropic state , the bosons have been shifted away from the diagonals and onto the axes .",
    "for @xmath238 as derived here , the effect is not very large ( @xmath239 of the total ) , but by adjusting slightly the masses , for instance by setting @xmath240 , nearly all the weight can be shifted to the axes , leading to a very pronounced anisotropy .",
    "to understand how this might relate to the cuprates it is helpful to take a step back . in the derivations",
    "above we have assumed that all the electrons are bound into bose pairs , which is reasonable provided t@xmath241 .",
    "however , for higher temperatures , where t@xmath242 , this assumption is not valid as thermal excitations lead to the break - up of pairs . in the extreme high temperature regime",
    "almost all the electrons are free .",
    "now , starting in the high temperature regime , as the temperature is lowered , the pairing fluctuations become more important and bosons start to form . in the gaussian approximation ,",
    "the onset of fluctuations is gradual , with a maximum at t@xmath0 .",
    "t@xmath12 can be interpreted as the temperature where the fluctuations become significant , which is not necessarily the same as t@xmath17 . as the bose number , @xmath183 , increases ,",
    "the fermionic spectral weight is correspondingly decreased according to eq .",
    "( [ number ] ) . given",
    "the strongly anisotropic bose number in fig .",
    "[ mass_theta ] we can expect a similar anisotropy in the pseudogap .",
    "interestingly , the bose number is maximum along the axes and minimum on the diagonals which is just the same as the angle dependence of the pseudogap observed by arpes measurements .",
    "lowering the temperature further leads to the creation of more bosons and the pseudogap becomes deeper .",
    "finally , at the bose - einstein condensation temperature a real @xmath2-wave superconducting gap will start to open , the maxima of which `` accidentally '' coincide with the pseudogap regions where there are most bosons .",
    "it is important here to make two comments .",
    "firstly , the pseudogap which we observe is _ not _ a superconducting effect in the sense that its origin does not lie in the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the superconducting order parameter , but rather in the formation of two - particle states which `` eat '' the available single - particle spectral weight in certain directions .",
    "secondly , although the angular variation of the pseudogap is intimately related to the presence of @xmath2-wave pairs , the relation between the two is not as simple as might first appear .",
    "a single flavour order parameter , either @xmath1-wave or @xmath2-wave , must have an _ isotropic _ mass tensor ( for @xmath2-wave this is shown as the dotted circle in fig .",
    "[ mass_theta ] ) , otherwise the theory will not be invariant under the square symmetry of the lattice . the angular anisotropy of the pseudogap comes not from the symmetry of a single order parameter , but from a coupling of the @xmath2-wave to the @xmath1-wave bosons via the anisotropic gradient , @xmath243 . , which has the full square symmetry of the lattice .",
    "equivalently we could say that the angular anisotropy is a reflection of the anisotropy in the masses of the @xmath46 and @xmath47 bosons : an @xmath46 boson prefers to travel in the @xmath46 direction and a @xmath47 boson prefers to travel in the @xmath47 direction .",
    "were the @xmath46 boson to be totally confined to the @xmath46-axis , and the @xmath47 boson to the @xmath47-axis , in which case @xmath244 , the angular distribution of the bosons would be sharply peaked along the axes and zero on the diagonals .",
    "we have seen that it is necessary to have both @xmath1- and @xmath2-wave order parameters if the pseudogap is to have any angular dependence , so it is natural to enquire about the nature of the superconducting state formed below t@xmath0 . in the preceeding calculations",
    "it has been assumed that in the low density , large coupling limit , the critical temperatures for the @xmath1- and @xmath2-wave fields become degenerate .",
    "now , just because two order parameters have the same t@xmath0 does not mean that they will be present in the condensate in equal measure . ignoring the gradient coupling for the moment , by analogy with eq .",
    "( [ bose_num_theta ] ) it is easy to see that , in a mixture of the two pure states , the heavier @xmath2 bosons will dominate by a ratio of @xmath245 . including the gradient coupling terms the modes are admixtures of @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons .",
    "the relative components can be found from the eigenvectors of the flavour matrix : @xmath246 where the @xmath1 component is , @xmath247 for the dominant mode , fig .",
    "[ eigenvector ] shows the variation of the @xmath1 component as a function of angle .",
    "( for the subdominant mode the same graph is produced by plotting 1/@xmath248 . ) for momenta lying along , or near , the diagonals , the dominant mode has an entirely @xmath2-wave character .",
    "as we move away from the diagonals and towards the @xmath46 and @xmath47 axes , the @xmath1-wave fraction grows , but even at its maximum value it is an order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath2-wave .",
    "we conclude that the dominant mode is essentially @xmath2-wave , whilst the subdominant one is essentially @xmath1-wave .",
    "thus , by including both the @xmath1- and @xmath2-wave order parameters in the same theory , as well as the gradient couplings between them , we have been able to produce a pseudogap state with a non - trivial angular dependence , qualitatively similar to that of the @xmath2-wave superconducting state .",
    "although the angle dependent pseudogap state requires an @xmath249 admixture , the superconducting state that it eventually gives way to has , for most intents and purposes , pure @xmath2-wave symmetry .",
    "in this paper we have considered an extended hubbard model with nearest neighbour attractive interaction as a phenomenological model for the high t@xmath0 superconducting cuprates . by introducing a tensorial version of the hubbard - stratonovi transformation",
    "we were able to derive an effective landau - ginzburg - wilson action describing both extended @xmath1- and @xmath2-wave superconductivity .",
    "the saddle point ( mean field ) approximation to the full action gave the phase diagram of the model as a function of chemical potential ( filling ) and temperature .",
    "near the centre of the band @xmath2-wave solutions were found to be dominant whilst the extended @xmath1-wave solutions were dominant near the band edges .",
    "the two flavours of superconductivity were separated from each other by two second order phase transitions , in between which there was found to exist a mixed time - reversal symmetry breaking @xmath135 phase .",
    "the alternative @xmath134 phase was ruled out except in the presence of orthorhombic distortions . at large values of the coupling ,",
    "non - zero critical temperatures were observed beyond the band edges , signaling the creation of bosonic bound states .    using the gaussian approximation to the lgw action , in the low density limit , where quartic terms representing interactions between bosons ought to be unimportant , we first reproduced the known large @xmath16 behaviour of the on - site attractive hubbard model , in which the bosons acquire a mass proportional to the coupling , @xmath16 , due to the process of virtual ionisation . in the equivalent , large @xmath120 ,",
    "limit the extended model showed qualitatively similar behaviour provided only nearest neighbour hopping was considered . introducing a next nearest neighbour",
    "hopping , @xmath213 , allowed diagonal hopping processes , circumventing the need for virtual ionisation .",
    "it was shown that , in the limit @xmath225 , there is only one flavour of stable boson , @xmath1-wave if @xmath250 or @xmath2-wave if @xmath251 , and that its mass is independent of @xmath120 , just like in a continuum model .",
    "it was then argued that , for @xmath252 , the existence of two different bosonic modes , with anisotopic gradient couplings , could lead to an angle dependent distribution of bosons .",
    "this was then given a possible interpretation as the cause of the pseudogap state : two - particle states `` eat '' the single - particle spectral weight in certain areas of momentum space .",
    "finally it was shown that , despite the mixing of the two different boson flavours , the superconducting ground state would be of predominantly @xmath2-wave character .",
