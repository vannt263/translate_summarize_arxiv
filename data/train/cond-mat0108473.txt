    "becs of alkali atoms first created and studied experimentally in 1995 - 1997 revived theorists interest on this subject@xcite . because the zeemann coupling in general provides stronger confining potentials for atoms compared with other trapping methods , and a rf evaporative cooling",
    "is needed to achieve becs , the first generation of becs was realized in magnetic traps in laboratories . in those early experiments , spins of atoms were completely polarized and becs with single component were achieved , similar to the bec of @xmath3 studied a few decades ago .",
    "apart from the complication of the confining potentials , the theoretical description of becs of alkali atoms with positive scattering lengths in magnetic traps can be carried out in the gross - pitaveskii approach@xcite .",
    "the activities on this subject are enormous and i should refer to an excellent review by dalfovo et al.@xcite .",
    "the physical properties of single component becs of alkali atoms depend on two length scales .",
    "the interatomic distance , which is about a few hundred nano - meters in most of experiments , characterizes the kinetic energy in the problem .",
    "the bec transition temperature which is determined by this length scale is about a few micro kelvins or lower in experiments .",
    "the upper limit of the atomic density in becs and the transition temperature are imposed by three - body recombination processes which lead to trap losses in experiments@xcite .",
    "the second length scale is the two - body scattering length , which is about a few nanometers for alkali atoms .",
    "it characterizes the interactions between atoms and therefore the chemical potentials .",
    "given the density of atoms and the scattering lengths in most of experiments , the chemical potentials are typically of the order of a few hundreds nano kelvins .",
    "amazingly , the scattering length depends on magnetic fields and the variation in scattering lengths is particularly substantial when the atoms are close to the feshbach resonance@xcite .",
    "this remarkable property of alkali atoms was observed in @xmath4 by inouye et al.@xcite , in @xmath5 by courteille et al .",
    "@xcite , roberts et al . @xcite and recently cornish et al.@xcite , in @xmath6 by vuletic et al.@xcite .",
    "collapsing of becs of @xmath7 atoms with negative scattering lengths was studied by sackett et al.@xcite .",
    "dynamics of collapsing was investigated theoretically in @xcite and remains to be fully understood .",
    "correspondingly , there are at least two classes phenomena investigated very extensively by experimentalists .",
    "the first one is connected with quantum coherence of becs .",
    "quantum interference between two condensates ( both spatial and temporal ) and the creation of vortices belong to this category@xcite .",
    "for instance , vortices were first created using a combination of internal transition and external rotation by matthews@xcite , as theoretically suggested by williams and holland in 1999 .",
    "arrays of vortices were found by madison et al.@xcite , who stirred becs by rotating the trap .",
    "superfluidity of becs has been examined by raman et al.@xcite who demonstrated frictionless flow and by marago et al.@xcite , who observed beautiful undamped scissors mode suggested by guery - odelin and stringari in 1999@xcite .",
    "the second class is related with scatterings between atoms , or the collective behavior of becs .",
    "the ac josephson effect of two internal states with different scattering lengths and zero sound excitations at coherent limit fall into this category@xcite .",
    "the second class phenomena are of particular interest from condensed matter physics points of view and let me describe two interesting experiments in some details . in the experiment in @xcite , hall et al .",
    "first prepared @xmath8 in a hyperfine spin state @xmath9 in magnetic traps . by applying external microwaves or",
    "so called @xmath10-pulses , they successfully transformed about fifty percent of atoms from @xmath11 state into @xmath12 state .",
    "the chemical potentials of these two condensates are different because of different scattering lengths .",
    "after certain waiting time @xmath13 , a fraction of the condensate at @xmath12 state is transformed back to @xmath11 state by another @xmath10-pulse .",
    "the interference between the original condensate and the newly converted condensate depends on the accumulated phases of two condensates after time @xmath13 , which are different because of two different chemical potentials @xmath14 for condensates with a density @xmath15 , a scattering length @xmath16 and an atomic mass @xmath17 .",
    "the temporal dependence of the interference observed by hall et al .",
    "does exhibit periodical oscillations at @xmath18 scale , expected by a simple estimate of the chemical potentials .",
    "the observation of zero sound excitations in @xmath19 becs was carried out by stamper - kurn et al.@xcite in 1998 . after a temporal magnetic field",
    "was applied to disturb the bec , a breathing of condensate was observed at a temperature much lower than the bec transition temperature .",
    "snap shots taken at @xmath20 apart indicate oscillations in the size of the bec with a period of a few @xmath18 , corresponding to the time interval for a sound like excitation to travel from one end of the bec to the other one . the sound velocity , being proportional to the square root of the compressibility , depends on the scattering lengths and appears to be consistent with the frequency of the oscillations .",
    "these oscillations were also shown quickly damped at the temperature close to the transition point , caused by scatterings with a thermal cloud .",
    "becs with multiple components were created and studied a few years later@xcite .",
    "particularly , stamper - kurn et al .",
    "successfully used optical beams to trap @xmath0 , which confines alkali atoms independent of spins and liberates spin degrees of freedom@xcite . for alkali atoms @xmath0 or @xmath8 , with nuclear spin @xmath21 and electrons at @xmath22 orbits , the energy splitting between hyperfine multiplets is of order @xmath23 . at temperatures as low as a few hundred nano kelvin , @xmath0 and @xmath8 atoms",
    "can be considered as simple bosons with a hyperfine spin @xmath24 .",
    "liberation of spins in becs in an optical environment indeed leads to a new dimension of studying becs , especially spin correlated condensates .",
    "this further inspired many theoretical activities on spinor bose - einstein condensates@xcite .",
    "the spin correlated states in @xmath0 were afterwards studied experimentally by stenger et al.@xcite .",
    "the new complication in becs in optical traps surely arises from the extra internal degree of hyperfine spins .",
    "when @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) atoms condense at each of the hyperfine states @xmath27 but all condense at the lowest orbital state , the ground state of @xmath28 noninteracting spin @xmath24 bosons has a @xmath29fold spin degeneracy ,    @xmath30    by contrast to its magnetically trapped cousins . presumably , hyperfine spin - dependent scatterings lift the degeneracy and lead to spin correlated states .",
    "optically trapped becs therefore set up a platform for the study of the quantum magnetism in many boson systems and add a new twist to already extremely fascinating systems .    for ultracold atoms in becs ,",
    "the spin - dependent two -body interaction is characterized by @xmath31 $ ] , as suggested in an early paper@xcite .",
    "here @xmath32 , @xmath33 ; @xmath34 , m is the mass of the atom and @xmath35 is the s - wave scattering length in the total spin @xmath36 channel .",
    "thus , spin correlation in becs is determined by @xmath37 . for",
    "@xmath8 studied experimentally by the jila group@xcite , @xmath38 or @xmath39 and the scattering is dominated by the total spin @xmath40 channel . in the ground state ,",
    "all spins of atoms prefer to align in a certain direction and have a maxima magnetization@xcite . for @xmath0",
    "studied experimentally by the mit group@xcite , the scattering between @xmath0 atoms is dominated by the total spin @xmath41 channel , i.e. @xmath42 . the scatterings between @xmath0 atoms thus lead to `` antiferromagnetic '' spin correlation . in this article",
    ", i will fully explore the properties of the bec of @xmath0 .",
    "efforts have been made to understand the ground state properties , exact excitation spectra , collective modes and topological excitations .",
    "theoretically , issues of spin ordering in the spinor becs are of particular interest and were treated by ho , and also ohmi and machinda in 1998 . in both works , the spin ordering was discussed in a mean field approximation , in the context of the gross - pitaveskii equation .",
    "ho also obtained two branches spin wave excitations by a gaussian expansion .",
    "the first attempt to understand spin correlation beyond the mean field limit was made by law , pu and bigelow@xcite .",
    "law et al . observed that the microscopic hamiltonian of n spin-1 bosons interacting via a spin - dependent two - body potential given above commutes with the total spin of the system ; the spin is a good quantum number and the exact eigenstates should be eigenstates of the total spin operator .",
    "when @xmath43 , the ground state should be a spin singlet and rotationally invariant .",
    "this was explicitly demonstrated in a zero mode approximation , where the finite momentum sector of the hilbert space was neglected@xcite . using a four - wave mixing method , law et al .",
    "obtained the exact excitation spectrum in a @xmath44 limit , a limit where all spatial fluctuations are neglected .",
    "these results in @xmath44 case were also derived by castin and herzog@xcite , using a geometrical description very close to the one i am going to introduce in this paper .",
    "al. s results , though are barely relevant to the particular experiment done by stenger et al .",
    ", given the number of atoms , time scales during which the experiment was performed and small biased magnetic fields in the experiment , nevertheless inexplicitly reveal the role of symmetry restoring processes and the nature of quantum fluctuations of the spin order in the problem .",
    "the even - odd effect in the excitation spectrum observed by law et al . further implies a discrete symmetry in the problem which i believe has a profound origin .    ho and yip later found that the singlet states obtained by law et al . are rather sensitive to an external magnetic field@xcite . in a thermal dynamical limit , an infinitesimal magnetic field will stablize the symmetry broken state and the rotationally invariant state is irrelevant as far as experiments with a small magnetic field are concerned",
    "this feature of @xmath0 was later realized to relate with the level spacing of the low lying excitations@xcite . for the @xmath44",
    "dimensional bec , the energy of low lying excitations scales down as the number of atoms and the quasi - degeneracy makes the system ultrasensitive to magnetic fields .",
    "a symmetry broken state , which can be constructed out of low lying excitations has an energy inversely proportional to the number of atoms involved and can be pinned by an infinitesimal field when the number of atoms is infinity .",
    "topological excitations in the spinor becs of @xmath0 have been paid a special tribute to by a few groups .",
    "linear defects were studied by leonhart and volovik@xcite , who pointed out the existence of alice strings in the becs of @xmath0 .",
    "textures of the skyrmion type were pointed out in@xcite ; and most recently , point defects were examined@xcite . except the work of leonhart and volovik ,",
    "most of the works on this subject were based on ho s original identification of the internal space , which missed the important discrete symmetry of @xmath1 type .",
    "therefore , many new aspects of topological defects studied in this paper have never been investigated .",
    "for instance , in a recent work @xcite , the authors applied the nonlinear @xmath45 model derived in @xcite to study static and dynamical properties of hedgehogs .",
    "unfortunately , the authors of that work failed to observe the correct internal space .",
    "many aspects of the point defects in the becs of @xmath0 , particularly those under the influence of the entanglement of the phase and spin orders including the homotopical indistinguishability between @xmath46 hedgehogs , between hedgehogs and closed loop @xmath47-disclinations were previously discussed @xcite .",
    "i will review those results in this article .",
    "the pursue of having a nonperturbative approach beyond a zero dimension approximation was first made in@xcite .",
    "that approach allows one to identify that the low energy spin dynamics in the becs of spin one atoms with antiferromagnetic interactions belongs to the same universality class of the nonlinear-@xmath45 model(nl@xmath45 m ) , a relatively well known subject , thanks to many studies in the context of field theory .",
    "the nl@xmath45 m also became known to many condensed matter physicists working with antiferromagnetic systems after a paper in 1983@xcite .",
    "in @xcite , the spin dynamics in the problem of n spin one bosons interacting via a spin - dependent two - body potential with @xmath48 was mapped into an @xmath49 nonlinear sigma model ( nl@xmath50 ) .",
    "@xmath51 at the zero magnetic field limit and @xmath52 in the presence of a weak magnetic field . with the help of this mapping ,",
    "the many - body aspect of @xmath0 becomes rather explicit and many properties including spin correlations in @xmath53 can be studied .",
    "furthermore , energetics and dynamics of topological excitations in becs can therefore be easily analyzed in this approach .    at a low density limit",
    ", it is also found that the ground state has a similar discrete symmetry as that of a uniaxial nematic phase of liquid crystals , except a @xmath47-phase factor as discussed extensively in @xcite and for this reason the condensate is at a quantum spin nematic state(_qsns _ ) .",
    "the ground state degeneracy space is @xmath54/z_2 $ ] , with @xmath55 depending on a magnetic field .",
    "the antiferromagnetic scatterings between cold atoms lead to a @xmath1 symmetry breaking .",
    "this discrete symmetry was later appreciated by demler et al . in the context of low lying excitations@xcite .",
    "demler et al . noticed that the @xmath1 symmetry in a symmetry broken state actually also appears in all low lying states . by imposing a proper projection in a functional integral approach",
    ", they showed that the full low energy physics in the phase and spin sector is given by @xmath1 gauge fields coupled with two matter fields characterized by an _",
    "xy _ model and a nl@xmath45 m .",
    "this work as well as the previous work @xcite open a new door for the studies of many - boson states .",
    "many issues , such as fractionalization of topological excitations , fractionalization of quasiparticles and topological order were studied and investigated with the help of this mapping@xcite .",
    "a number of new predictions have been made for the spinor bec , most of which have never been studied experimentally .",
    "the mapping also provides a starting point for the future study of some strongly correlated fermionic systems .",
    "the purpose of this article is to provide a guideline and introduction to some ideas on the spinor becs developed very recently in @xcite . through out the article , i will emphasis on the concepts of topology , at levels of both the mean field approximation , which is suitable for a discussion on symmetry broken states and beyond , which is essential for the study of symmetry restored states .",
    "this point of view might be dramatically different from the conventional ones shared by atomic physicists .",
    "on the other hand , it seems to me that the nature has chosen to behave in such a unconventional , complicated way that i am left with no alternatives , or a simpler presentation .",
    "it also appears to my collaborators and me during this investigation that this is a subject full of surprises and new issues keep on poping up . at the time of writing , i present results which i believe to be relevant to becs investigated in experiments .",
    "there are many other issues still remaining to be explored .",
    "furthermore , some descriptions given here are qualitative and conceptional , so as to be communicated in a most efficient way . like many other new subjects ,",
    "a more quantitative aspect of some properties can be achieved only after basic notions are established and will be present in a series of separate works . at last ,",
    "i should point out that many strongly correlated electronic systems are believed to share very similar topological properties@xcite and therefore the becs might be systems where some of basic ideas established in strongly correlated electron systems can be tested experimentally .",
    "understanding of the spinor bec might as well shed some light on other fermionic superfluids such as p - wave triplet superconductors .",
    "so , i will review the nonperturbative approach recently formulated .",
    "results obtained previously by different groups with other methods can be reproduced in this new representation .",
    "i will of course go beyond previous framework and outline many novel results obtained in the last two years @xcite . in section",
    "ii , a mapping from the original microscopic model of n spin one bosons with @xmath48 into a @xmath56 at long wave length limit will be introduced .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding n - body wave function is shown to be invariant under a @xmath57 rotation of a vector @xmath58 and a @xmath2 gauge transformation .",
    "at last , @xmath1 gauge fields are introduced in the model to enforce the discrete symmetry .    in section iii ,",
    "symmetry broken states are examined .",
    "the internal order parameter space for the bec is identified as @xmath59/z_2$](zero field limit ) .",
    "linear , point defects and `` particle like '' textures are discussed with an emphasis on the influence of the @xmath60 group and the discrete @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "particularly , a family of strings representing @xmath47 spin disclinations superimposed by superfluid vortices of half integer circulation are studied .",
    "the distinguishabilities of @xmath46 hedgehogs , both physical and homotopical , are analysised .",
    "the connection between closed loop @xmath47-disclinations and hedgehogs is established .",
    "the effect of an external magnetic field is also reviewed .",
    "the nl@xmath45 m in this case has two components instead of three at zero external field .",
    "the ground state is degenerate in a manifold @xmath61/z_2 $ ] .    in section iv",
    ", symmetry unbroken states are studied in the scheme of the nl@xmath45 m .",
    "the possibility of having nematic order - disorder phase transitions and the nature of spin correlation are addressed .",
    "the ground state of n spin one bosons interacting via @xmath62 spin - dependent two - body potentials in 1d limit is also present . in section",
    "v , the influence of the @xmath1 symmetry on the symmetry unbroken states is discussed .",
    "one of the most interesting consequencies of having @xmath1 symmetries is the possible fractionalization of topological excitations . under the influence of the @xmath1 symmetry",
    ", it is shown that vortices can be fractionalized into half - vortices .",
    "it is also pointed out that instead of a condensate of individual atoms , one can have a singlet pair condensate , which supports free @xmath1 vortices .    in section",
    "vi , the property of connection fields is analysised and hidden topological order is identified in spin disordered becs .",
    "the existence `` topological order '' is argued due to an `` order from disorder '' mechanism .    in section vii ,",
    "i discuss the symmetry restoring of a finite size nematically ordered state .",
    "quantum mechanical nature of the order parameters in finite size @xmath0 bec was addressed in connections of experimental probes , taking into account the metastability of the atomic gas . in section viii ,",
    "i make some remarks on the relation between the becs considered here and other strongly correlated magnetic systems .",
    "the inconsistency between the mean field point of view taken in @xcite and the spin singlet ground state obtained in @xcite , lies in the heart of the quantum symmetry restoring . if one starts with the symmetry broken solution in the gpe approach , for instance",
    ", one can ask how the rotation symmetry is restored after all and when that happens .",
    "a more practical question would be , given the life time of the metastable bec gaseous cloud studied in the experiment , is the rotationally invariant state relevant ?",
    "this question motivates us to develop a nonperturbative approach .",
    "the answer to this question requires a complete characterization of nonlinear spin dynamics .",
    "the second issue concerning us is the validity of the zero mode approximation@xcite .",
    "though the exact solutions in a zero mode approximation provide information of low lying excitations , they fail to yield spatial - temporal spin fluctuations , which are essential for the most general description of the ground state of @xmath63 interacting @xmath24 bosons .",
    "the finite momentum sector of hilbert space is clearly critical for such a discussion .",
    "it is also worth commenting that the gpe approach with three components@xcite , on the other hand , does permit a gradient expansion around the symmetry broken solution in principal .",
    "however , such a procedure is feasible only when the derivation of the true ground state from the uniform solution is small .",
    "practically , the gpe approach works in a small vicinity of the symmetry broken solution in the order parameter space and is far from being a general description .",
    "the third and perhaps the most important one is the description of nonlinear spin dynamics in the spinor bec . the failure of the generalized gpe approach far away from its mean field solution is largely due to the fact that the collective variables chosen there are not suitable for a description of the nonlinear spin dynamics .",
    "for this reason , in the framework of the gpe approach , the interactions between low lying excitations(spin waves ) which eventually disrupt the symmetry broken state are barely tractable .",
    "for instance , when the zero point rotation energy of each atom caused by two - body scatterings is high enough , long - range spin order predicted in the gpe approach is destroyed even at zero temperature(see details in section iv ) . in that case , spin correlations can be nontrivial and yet not characterized by the simple solutions of the gpe .",
    "in addition , the spin correlated state in a very anisotropic trap , or @xmath53 , is clearly beyond the validity of the gpe approach .",
    "efforts along this line had been carried out recently . to have a general approach of studying spin correlated states of spin one bosons with @xmath48 was the purpose of those works .",
    "it is reviewed in the rest of this section .",
    "i will demonstrate a geometrical approach which allows us to go far beyond the three - component gross - pitaveskii approach and explore a variety of possible spin correlated states .",
    "following the discussions above , to study the spin correlated bec , it is important that a set of collective coordinates are correctly defined .",
    "idealistically , these variables should be chosen to a ) completely characterize the nonlinear spin dynamics in the whole parameter space and b ) to form a simplest representation for two - body spin dependent scatterings .",
    "for this purpose , we use two vectors @xmath64 living on two unit spheres to describe the nonlinear spin dynamics in the presence of spin - dependent scatterings .",
    "we are going to map the n interacting spin one boson problem into an @xmath65 nl@xmath45 m self - consistently .",
    "we make two assumptions to proceed further .",
    "first , there exists a class of spatially varying n - body wave functions , out of which the n interacting spin-1 bosons ground state and the low lying excitations can be constructed .",
    "the whole class is characterized by a few collective coordinates ( @xmath66 introduced below ) .",
    "second , the energy of this class n - body wave functions under consideration can be expressed in terms of a finite number of collective variables .",
    "quantization of the collective modes yields elementary low lying excitations , which can interact with each other strongly .",
    "the exact n - body wave function of the ground state is characterized by the zero point motions of collective variables and their multi - couplings .",
    "practically , in most limits , the ground state is conveniently characterized by the correlation functions .",
    "the low energy spin excitations are of a collective nature ; the excitations of individual spins are neglected in the leading order approximation @xmath67 .",
    "the correctness of this approach is justified by the following measure : the resultant theory which is written in terms of collective variables instead of n - body wave functions of individual atoms should produce the correct nonlinear spin dynamics , such as euler s equation of motion , conservation laws , at the long wave length limit .",
    "the theory is self - consistent if this measure is satisfied .",
    "the derivation of the mapping was obtained and summarized in @xcite .    to describe the spin correlated bec , it is most convenient to introduce weyl representation of @xmath68 involving polynomials of a unit vector @xmath69@xcite .",
    "each unit vector is represented by a point @xmath70 on a sphere with polar coordinates @xmath71 ; namely    @xmath72    the corresponding hyperfine spin operators are @xmath73 the scalar product between two wave functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 is defined as @xmath76 .",
    "( we reserve @xmath77 for the spin rotation discussed below . )    under spin rotations @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 transform into    @xmath81    where @xmath82 .",

    "the examples are given in fig.1 .",

    "spherical polar coordinates @xmath562 defined on a unit sphere , @xmath107 is a differential operator in terms of @xmath71 and the eigenstates of @xmath563 are spherical harmonics @xmath564 .",
    "the corresponding wave packet can be constructed as    @xmath565    where constant @xmath566 is estimated in the appendix c. @xmath567 are spheric harmonics . only states with even number @xmath180 are present in the wave packet(we assume @xmath63 is an even number at the moment ) . for this packet , @xmath568 and @xmath569 when @xmath570 but @xmath571 is vanishingly small .",
    "the energy and the spread in @xmath107 can be estimated as    @xmath572    according to the derivation in the appendix c. therefore , an excited state where @xmath58 is well defined on the unit sphere up to a spread @xmath558 has an infinitesimal energy cost when @xmath63 approaches infinity .",
    "the wave packet constructed in eq.[packet ] , being energetically extremely close to the singlet ground state , indicates that the singlet is very unstable with respect to external magnetic fields . a field of the order @xmath573 will stablize the symmetry broken state in eq.[packet ] .",
    "however , when one deals with bec of a small number of atoms , the level spacing in the excitation spectrum gets bigger .",
    "the system becomes perturbative with respective to an external magnetic field , as far as the disturbance is less than the energy gap in the problem .",
    "so the claimed ultrasensitivity is simply a consequence of nearly degenerate low lying excitations in the large @xmath63 limit .",
    "moreover , this ultrasensitivity is absent in the spin disordered states where a many body spin gap is opened up .    according to the equation of motion in eq.[dynamics ] , as the time evolves , because of the two - body scatterings with @xmath62 , @xmath552 gradually precesses along the finite @xmath574 . indeed , the spread of @xmath58 at a time @xmath551 becomes @xmath575 which is valid at @xmath576 . in an opposite limit",
    "the spread is of order unity .",
    "following eq.[sym - res ] , at a time of order @xmath577 , @xmath578 exceeds the initial spread @xmath579 . at a longer time",
    "@xmath580 , @xmath58 starts to explore the whole unit sphere @xmath60 and the rotation symmetry is restored quantum mechanically in the presence of spin - dependent scatterings(see fig.13 ) .",
    "a discussion is present in appendix d when an external field is applied .",
    "fig.13 the symmetry restoring caused by the spin - dependent interactions(@xmath62 ) .",
    "schematically shown are the spreads of @xmath58 on a unit sphere at @xmath559 ( a ) , @xmath577 ( b ) , @xmath581(c ) .",
    "eq.[sym - res ] shows how a symmetry broken state in finite size becs of @xmath0 becomes a rotationally invariant state at an asymptotically long time . for @xmath0 atoms interacting via a two - body interaction with @xmath48",
    ", it was argued in ref.@xcite that in a zero mode approximation the atoms should condensate at @xmath582 , with the rotation symmetry broken . on the other hand , based on an analogy to the nonlinear wave - mixing theory ,",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that the exact ground state should be a spin singlet with the rotation symmetry preserved .",
    "the symmetry restoring in a finite size system as discussed above explains the apparent inconsistency between these previous theoretical works .",
    "given the number of particles as @xmath583 and @xmath584 , the typical time scale for this to take place is @xmath585 .",
    "this time scale is much longer than the life time of the trap @xcite .",
    "therefore the features associated with the singlet wave function proposed in ref.@xcite can not be observed under that particular experiment condition .",
    "however , for a smaller cloud with @xmath586 atoms , the symmetry restoring can take place within @xmath587secs , before the recombination takes place . in this case",
    ", the ground state should be characterized by a singlet wave function , instead of a saddle point solution .",
    "eq.[sym - res ] also imposes restrictions on the measurement of a symmetry broken state .",
    "an measurement of @xmath58 in becs of @xmath0 discussed here excites the ground state to an excited state where @xmath58 has a finite spread on @xmath60 ; the energy of this state is infinitesimal small in the thermal dynamical limit .",
    "the time scale for @xmath58 to relax , or to restore the broken symmetry is determined by the two - body spin dependent scattering lengths and the number of atoms in becs following eq.[sym - res ] .",
    "experimentally , the relevance of the singlet ground state or the symmetry broken state depends on the life time of the metastable gas or the interval between measurements . any measurement taken at a time scale longer than @xmath588 should reveal the symmetry restoring because of zero point motions of @xmath58 .",
    "possible measurements , including measurements of birefringence and small angle light scatterings , to detect orders in @xmath58 in the weakly interacting limit were discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasising that by contrast to a classical nematic liquid crystal where @xmath58 is pinned along the external field and all the goldstone modes are gapped , @xmath58 can still freely rotate in a plane perpendicular to a weak magnetic field in the quantum spin nematic state under consideration .",
    "so the singularity in small angle light scattering survives an external magnetic field ; only the amplitude is reduced by a factor of one - half , when an external field is applied . in a nematic disordered phase , the singularity gets smeared at @xmath589(@xmath374 is the correlation length ) , which can be used to study a possible phase transition .",
    "though the nl@xmath45 m description of the quantum spin nematic states bears some similarities with that of the heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin system(hafs ) , there are at least two differences between the present problem and the heisenberg problem .",
    "first , for the nl@xmath45 m of the hafs , the ground state is invariant under a rotation on a sphere @xmath60 ; the order parameter space is a unit sphere @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath590 is homotopic to zero and the linear singularity is absent in this system . @xmath591 and the corresponding point defects are usual hedgehogs with a winding number @xmath63 distinguishable from @xmath592 .",
    "overall , the topological defects in the heisenberg spin system are qualitatively different from what we have in the qsns described in section iii",
    ".    however , when a weak magnetic field is applied , @xmath58 in the nl@xmath45 m of the hfas lives on a unit circle @xmath203 and @xmath593 is an integer group .",
    "the linear defects are integer vortices . consequently , in @xmath459 in the presence of an external field",
    ", the interaction between topological linear defects in the qsns at an asymptotically large distance decays in a same fashion as that in the hafs .",
    "we expect that in this specific limit , the finite temperature phase transitions are of the same universality classes . in addition , @xmath47-spin disclinations superimposed with half vortices interact with each other via one half of the interaction strength between two integer vortices . because of the reduced interaction strength between half vortices in the qsns at @xmath594 , the critical temperature is lower than that of the hafs .",
    "it should be noticed that though the spin - dependent scatterings lift the degeneracy between different spin configurations and result in a spin nematic state when @xmath48 , the critical temperature is determined by the density , i.e. @xmath595 which is independent of @xmath37 in the leading order approximation . when the zero point motions of @xmath58 in weakly interacting becs are taken into account , @xmath434",
    "is shifted downward by an amount @xmath596 proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "second , in the heisenberg antiferromagnetic system with a underlying spin @xmath255 , both the zero point kinetic energy ( @xmath597 ) and the potential energy ( @xmath598 ) depend on the exchange integrals and the corresponding @xmath75 , the dimensionless coupling constant in the nl@xmath45 m , is inversely proportional to the spin @xmath255 only .",
    "this makes observing zero temperature order - disorder phase transitions extremely difficult . in the current situation , the potential energy is independent of the interaction while the zero point kinetic energy is proportional to the scattering length .",
    "@xmath75 is determined by the density and the scattering length instead of spins of bosons and is a continuous variable in the qsns .",
    "the classical nematic order - disordered transitions were studied a few years ago based on a lattice gauge theory@xcite .",
    "the inversion symmetry of a nematic director is incorporated as a @xmath1 gauge invariance in a lattice model ,    @xmath599    where @xmath600 are introduced as the @xmath1 gauge fields .",
    "the sum is again over all elementary plaquettes .",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant under a @xmath1 gauge transformation : @xmath601 , @xmath602 ( all @xmath603 links involving @xmath604 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ toner ] depends on two energies scales : @xmath605 as the microscopic nematic interaction and @xmath407 as the core energy of a @xmath47 spin disclination . at @xmath606 , the @xmath1 field",
    "is activated .",
    "as @xmath605 decreases , a spin nematic state is driven into an isotropic state where the free energy of an infinity long @xmath47 disclination is finite .",
    "the phase transition is of the first order and believed to be the one described by the landau theory . at @xmath607 ,",
    "the @xmath1 gauge field is frozen . in this case , as @xmath605 decreases , the nematic state is driven into another isotropic state where the free energy of a @xmath47 disclination is proportional to the length of it .",
    "the transition is of the second order .",
    "the gauge theory description of the classical nematic liquid predicts two isotropic and optically transparent liquids .",
    "they are different only in topological order .",
    "one of them has the hidden @xmath1 order and the other one does nt . a recent interesting experiment by tokyo liquid crystal group did support this scenario@xcite .",
    "the optical turbidity measurement showed a transition between an optically turbid phase , which apparently can be identified as a nematic phase and an optically transparent state which represents an isotropic liquid .",
    "however , within the isotropic liquid , the dynamical slow down measurement indicates an additional phase transition between two optically transparent phases .",
    "though it is not clear at the moment whether these two phases carry different topological order , the situation there is quite encouraging .",
    "finally , i want to remark on other electronic liquids which are believed to be `` nematic '' in nature .",
    "the first one is the ground state of @xmath608 , which was recently confirmed to be a p - wave superconducting state in a series of beautiful experiments@xcite . in a p - wave superconductor of @xmath608 ,",
    "a cooper pair is a spin triplet and experiments further suggest that it be an anderson - morel state@xcite . if a pair is considered as a composited boson , then it occupies a @xmath609 channel of spin one states , up to a rotation of the quantization axis .",
    "the order parameter can be written in a tensor form as @xmath610 in the absence of spin - orbit couplings , with @xmath611 , @xmath612 being pauli matrices . by examining this pairing wave function",
    ", one expects that many aspects of @xmath613 should be very similar to the spinor bec described above .",
    "in particular , the concepts of the hidden symmetries and hidden gauge fields should be applicable in those systems@xcite .",
    "of course , in addition to this , there is a new twist in p - wave superconductors , that is the broken time invariance and broken parity@xcite .",
    "it leads to possible statistical transmutation of topological excitations and quasiparticles .",
    "this remains to be understood in the context of quantum nematic states discussed in this article .",
    "results on spinor becs discussed in this article will have no doubt to be demonstrative for the understanding of the physics in @xmath608 superconducting crystals .",
    "the fermionic nematic liquids were also suggested for cuprates recently .",
    "the nematic model discussed in @xcite , and the qsns in the spinor bec discussed here are intimately connected with the recent @xmath1 gauge theory developed for high-@xmath434 superconductors@xcite . to understand the connection between a `` fractionalized '' metal ( non fermi liquid ) and a normal metal(fermi liquid ) , the authors of that work pointed out that fractionalization and confining issues in cuprates can be partially understood by taking into account an inversion symmetry in a spinon - chargon model . in anisotropic phases of some strongly correlated electron systems such as `` quantum hall nematic phases '' , fermionic nematic liquids , or nematic metals were also investigated by kivelson , fradkin and their collaborators@xcite . v. organnesyan et al .",
    "recently showed the breakdown of the fermi liquid theory in electronic nematic phases .",
    "the investigations carried out for the spinor bec therefore have possible impacts on the understanding of spin - charge separation or electron fractionalization phenomenon , which was first envisioned for cuprates about 15 years ago@xcite .",
    "as one of the most interesting inventions by theorists in condensed matter physics , spin - charge separation still continuously receives a lot of attentions from condensed matter physicists .",
    "though microscopically becs studied here are very different from those strongly correlated electronic systems , the long wave length physics do bear many similarities to some models employed for electron liquids .",
    "studies of the quantum spin nematic states , in particular the quantum orders and spin fractionalization@xcite , not only are important for the understanding of spinor becs , but also shed some light on some long standing issues in many - body physics .",
    "being free of imperfections and easy to be manipulated magnetically or optically , the qsns might be a potentially new platform for exploring some basic ideas in strongly correlated electron systems , which have not been settled .",
