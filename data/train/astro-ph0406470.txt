    "several methodologies for the precise measurements of p - mode frequencies have been developed over the years .",
    "these techniques have evolved as the quality of the observations have improved over the years .",
    "more recently , such methods have produced frequency and rotational frequency splitting tables  typically based on 36-day - long and 72-day - long time series for gong and mdi data respectively  that have been the basis for countless inferences of the structure and dynamics of the solar interior .",
    "some eight years after the deployment of the gong network and the launch of the soho spacecraft , we now have access to more than half a decade of nearly uninterrupted times series of solar observations . the mdi team has recently produced a 2088-day - long time series of spherical harmonic coefficients at a one minute sampling interval , namely a time series in excess of 3 millions points . for low - degree and low - frequency modes",
    "the availability of such a very long time series provides a unique opportunity to develop a mode fitting methodology that exploits the properties of such an exquisite data set .",
    "i present here a new methodology that i have developed to fit modes using very long time series .",
    "this methodology includes an optimal multi - taper spectral estimator , the complete leakage matrix ( _ i.e. _ , horizontal as well as vertical components ) , an asymmetric profile and the simultaneous fitting of individual profiles at all the azimuthal orders ( @xmath1 ) for a given ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) mode .",
    "the contamination by nearby modes ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) within the fitting range is also included . since simultaneous fitting on these contaminants is impractical , the fitting procedure is iterated  _",
    "i.e. _ , the characteristics of the contaminants used in the fitting correspond to the values fitted at the previous iteration .",
    "the primary goal for this work was to extend the mode fitting to low - order and low - degree modes .",
    "the low degree modes carry information on the structure and dynamics of the deep interior while the low - order low - degree modes are long lived ( _ i.e. _ , show very narrow peaks ) and can thus be measured with very high precision . since their amplitude is small , they will emerge above the background noise only for very long time series .",
    "the secondary goals were to fit simultaneously all the modes instead of using the traditional polynomial expansion in @xmath6 , while using the complete leakage matrix , as well as to include the well known mode profile asymmetry .",
    "i describe the data sets i used in section 2 , and present the details of the methodology in section 3 . in section 4 i present the results of fitting both mdi and gong 2088-day - long co - eval time series .",
    "these results are compared to equivalent estimates from the mdi team and the gong project .",
    "i also present the results of fitting two - year - long subsets of that time series for both data sets , and how the fitted parameters change with epoch and henceforth with solar activity .",
    "the work presented here is based on times series of spherical harmonic coefficients computed from full - disk observations by the mdi and gong instruments and limited to @xmath7 .",
    "the mdi 2088-day - long time series was used to develop the methodology .",
    "it was then applied to the co - eval gong data set .",
    "both data sets were also subdivided in five 728-day - long overlapping segments ( actually 1,048,576 minute long , _",
    "i.e. _ : @xmath8 ) , each offset by some 364 days ( _ i.e. _ , 524,288 minutes ) from the previous one .",
    "the last 728-day - long segment was completed by augmenting the 2088-day - long time series by an extra 97 days ( _ i.e. _ , 139,008 minutes ) to fill it completely .",
    "the respective ranges of all the time series analyzed are shows in table  [ table : timeranges ] .",
    ".respective time ranges for the time - series analyzed [ table : timeranges ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]        figure  [ fig : cmp_w_mdi1 ] compares results from my fit to the mdi 2088-day - long time series to average values computed from 27 tables resulting from fitting 72-day - long times series that covers the same time span ) correspond to the time interval when contact with the soho spacecraft was lost . ] and are routinely computed by the mdi team @xcite .",
    "the averaging was weighted by the uncertainty  to reflect the relative fill factor of each period .",
    "the comparison is for singlets , since the mdi fitting procedure uses a polynomial expansion in @xmath1 .",
    "the top panel illustrates the region of the @xmath3 ",
    "@xmath9 diagram where fitting a very long time series allows for detecting additional low order modes .",
    "the comparison of the resulting fitting uncertainty ( lower right ) shows  as expected  that at high frequency the uncertainty is dominated by the mode linewidth while at low frequency by the length of the time series .",
    "this figure also shows a systematic difference between frequencies , with a specific frequency dependence .",
    "one obvious reason for this difference is the fact that schou s fitting uses a symmetric profile while i am fitting an asymmetric one .    to estimate the effect of fitting a symmetric profile to an asymmetric peak",
    "i have computed a grid of isolated asymmetric profiles and fitted them with symmetric ones .",
    "the resulting offset in frequency varies nearly linearly with the asymmetry coefficient as defined in my parameterization , to the one i use , @xmath10 , namely @xmath11 .",
    "] , for a given fwhm , as shown in figure  [ fig : sym_vs_asym ] . the systematic error introduced by fitting an asymmetric peak with a symetric profile",
    "is thus given by @xmath12    roughly half of the frequency differences seen in figure  [ fig : cmp_w_mdi1 ] can be explained by this model , as shown figure  [ fig : cmp_w_mdi2 ] .",
    "the residual differences after correcting for the asymmetry using eq .",
    "[ eq : dnuasym ] , are marginaly significant , _",
    "i.e. _  at the 4@xmath13 level , and still show a systematic trend with frequency .    back in 1991 , schou ( private communication ) fitted one 72-day - long mdi time series using an asymmetric profile as well as a symmetric one .",
    "the comparison between his symmetric and asymmetric fitting for that time series and for modes up to @xmath14 is shown in figure  [ fig : cmp_sym_vs_asym ] .",
    "the frequency differences compare very well with the systematic differences seen in figure  [ fig : cmp_w_mdi1 ] and are nearly twice as large as the values predicted by eq .",
    "[ eq : dnuasym ] . while one could be tempted to rescale the prediction of eq .",
    "[ eq : dnuasym ] by some _",
    "ad hoc _ factor , i must point out that not only there is no rationale for this  unless either the leakage matrix or the horizontal to vertical ratio or both are substantially wrong  but also that a single factor would not match the observed differences ( such factor would have to be quite different for frequencies above and below 3 mhz ) .",
    "comparison of mode linewidths , amplitudes and background levels are shown in figure  [ fig : cmp_w_mdi3 ] .",
    "the mode linewidth comparison shows a small systematic discrepancy ( _ i.e. _ , a factor of 1.2 ) above 2.5 mhz , while below 2.5 mhz it indicates that the mdi estimates are too large  most likely as a result of the resolution limit of the 72-day - long time series  despite being corrected for the intrinsic frequency resolution of the time series .",
    "the mode power and background level estimates compare rather well .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmp_w_gong1 ] compares results from my fit to the gong 2088-day - long time series to average values based on 58 tables resulting from fitting 36-day - long times series that covers the same time span and are routinely computed by the gong project @xcite .",
    "the averaging was weighted by the uncertainty  to reflect the relative fill factor of each period .",
    "singlets were then computed  by fitting a clebsch - gordan polynomial expansion to the multiplets , with a 3@xmath13 rejection of outliers  to produce comparisons similar to the case of the mdi observations .",
    "unfortunately the gong fitting methodology does not produce consistent frequency tables : for a substantial number of modes the same multiplets are not fitted every time , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : gong_incons ] .",
    "the averages used in the comparison in figure  [ fig : cmp_w_gong1 ] correspond to the case where the multiplet is measured at least 10 times out of 58 . using a higher threshold  to obtain better temporal averages",
    " would reduce substantially the resulting frequency set .",
    "the lower snr of the gong observations at low frequency does not allow to push mode fitting down to orders as low as for the mdi observations . but using a long time series still allowed me to fit low order modes that are rarely ( less than 10 out of 58 times ) fitted by the gong project .",
    "the frequency comparison , presented in figure  [ fig : cmp_w_gong2 ] , shows systematic differences  whether using singlets or multiplets .",
    "the gong project also fits a symmetric profile , hence some of the discrepency can be attributed to fitting a symmetric profile to an asymmetric peak .",
    "the residual differences , after correcting for the asymmetry using eq .",
    "[ eq : dnuasym ] , are also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cmp_w_gong2 ] for both singlets and multiplets .",
    "the corrected singlets show marginally significant differences ( at the 4@xmath13 level ) with a systematic trend with frequency as for the mdi comparison ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cmp_w_mdi2 ] ) .",
    "the corrected multiplets show the same trend with frequency , but with less significance ( 0.8@xmath13 ) simply because the uncertainties on the multiplets are larger .",
    "comparison of mode linewidth , presented in figure  [ fig : cmp_w_gong3 ] , indicates that below 2.5 mhz the gong values are dominated by the frequency resolution of the time series  not surprisingly , since by contrast to mdi s estimates they are not corrected for that effect  while agreeing rather well above 2.5 mhz  except for the dip between 4 and 4.5 mhz .",
    "mode power levels compare rather well  except at low and high frequencies  while estimates of the background level do not compare as well .",
    "schou ( private communication , 2004 ) has carried out a fitting of the 2088-day - long time series as well  using the same methodology he uses for fitting the 72-day - long time series .",
    "he has graciously provided me with the results of that fit for a direct comparison that is shown in figures  [ fig : cmp_w_mdi2088d_1 ] and  [ fig : cmp_w_mdi2088d_2 ] .",
    "coverage over the @xmath15 diagram is comparable , while the comparison of the uncertainties on the frequency suggests  as indicated earlier  that my estimates might be too conservative , by as much as a factor 3 .",
    "the comparison of the mode frequencies ( singlets ) shows again systematic differences , that are in part explained by the effect of not including the mode asymmetry .    the residual frequency differences after correcting for the asymmetry using eq .",
    "[ eq : dnuasym ] are at the 3@xmath13 level and present a residual systematic variation with frequency .",
    "the mode linewidths agree remarkably well ( the discrepancy factor of @xmath16 is no longer present )  except at very low frequency where my uncorrected estimates are biased by the frequency resolution .",
    "the mode power and background level estimates compare rather well .",
    "changes in frequency , linewidth and asymmetry , with respect to the values estimated from the 2088-day - long time series , and using mdi observations over the five 728-day - long segments are illustrated in figure  [ fig : tc_mdi ] .",
    "this figure shows that the frequency changes with epoch scale with frequency and range from 5 to 800 nhz , a now well established property that can be explained by changes with activity levels concentrated near the solar surface .",
    "the frequency changes at low degrees and very low frequency are very small and barely significant .",
    "these changes are thus small enough to justify using very long time series to fit these modes .",
    "changes in linewidth with epoch also scale with frequency , with relative changes as large as 20% observed around 3 mhz .",
    "changes at low frequency are hard to measure since the measured width is dominated by the spectral resolution .",
    "the mode asymmetry shows no significant sign of change with time .",
    "changes in frequency , linewidth and asymmetry , with respect to the values estimated from the 2088-day - long time series , and using gong observations over the five 728-day - long segments are shown in figure  [ fig : tc_gong ] .",
    "these are very similar to the ones for the mdi data .",
    "changes in frequency , computed from multiplets rather than singlets , with respect to epoch are shown for both data set in figure  [ fig : tc_multiplets ] , as a function of frequency and azimuthal order .",
    "the individual frequency differences were binned over an equispaced grid in @xmath9 and @xmath0 to generate this figure .",
    "this figure shows that the change in frequencies is concentrated near the sectoral modes and that it is dominated by a pattern mostly symmetric in @xmath1 and nearly constant in time  given a time dependant scaling factor .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in figure  [ fig : tc_multiplets_2 ] where the top panels show the average of the absolute value of the binned frequency differences , while the midle panels show how well the changes for each segment scale with that average .",
    "the bottom panels show the variation of the mean scaled changes and the nearly constancy of the rms of these scaled changes .",
    "fitting very - long time series has allowed me to push the precise characterization of low degree modes to lower frequencies .",
    "the use of such a very long time series is well justified for fitting of these modes since their variation with activity remains small and comparable to the fitting uncertainty itself .",
    "the resulting table of frequencies will allow us to further improve inferences on the structure and dynamics of the solar deep interior .",
    "the methodology i have developed includes the most up - to - date procedural elements : the use of an optimized sine multi - tapered power spectrum estimator ; the simultaneous fitting of all azimuthal orders  each individually parameterized ; the use of the complete leakage matrix and the inclusion of an asymmetric mode profile .",
    "the inter - comparison of the values resulting from my fit to the co - eval mdi and gong time series is very good .",
    "the comparison with equivalent values produced by the mdi team and the gong project is not as good",
    ". it is complicated by the inclusion in my fit of the mode profile asymmetry .",
    "the observed differences in mode frequencies are most likely dominated by the effect of including or not the mode profile asymmetry .",
    "unfortunately a simple model for this effect does not fully account for the discrepancies .",
