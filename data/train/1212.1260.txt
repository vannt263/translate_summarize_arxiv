    "detection of high - energy neutrinos would be an important step towards identifying the origin of cosmic rays .",
    "interestingly , through analysis designed to search for ultra high - energy ( @xmath1 pev ) and high quality shower events over a period of 672.7 live days between 2010 and 2012 with icecube , two pev neutrino - induced cascade events have been found @xcite .",
    "the two events were observed on august 9 , 2011 and january 3 , 2012 , and each have an energy of approximately 1 - 10 pev .",
    "the observation of two events with an expected background of 0.14 events from the atmospheric neutrinos corresponds to a significance of @xmath2 .",

    "gamma - ray bursts are an attractive possibility for the reported two pev neutrinos because the predicted neutrino emission in the standard internal shock model peaks at pev energies .",
    "notably , previous searches of grb neutrinos with icecube via stacking analysis of many triggered grbs have yield none detection@xcite",
    ". the approach to search for neutrinos from triggered grbs is through analysis of upgoing neutrinos that are correlated in time and direction with known grbs , which is different from that of detecting diffuse neutrinos .",
    "the most stringent constraint is given by the combined analysis of the icecube 40- and 59-string ( ic40 + 59 ) data of upgoing neutrinos from 215 triggered grbs , which leads to an upper limit that is claimed to be below the expected flux@xcite .",
    "beside the contribution by triggered grbs for which the stacking analysis has been performed , grbs that do not trigger detectors due to their low flux may also contribute to the diffuse neutrino flux .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study whether the sum contribution of triggered grbs and untriggered grbs can explain the reported two pev neutrinos under the constraint that the stacked neutrino flux of 215 triggered grbs is below the ic40 + 59 sensitivity .",
    "the untriggered grbs defined in our paper are normal grbs ( i.e. belonging to the normal grb population ) that do not trigger the current detectors .",
    "they are normal grbs in the low - luminosity end of the luminosity function ( for normal grbs ) and/or locating at high redshifts and hence they can elude the detection by current grb detectors ( e.g. fermi / gbm ) due to the limited sensitivity .",

    "the estimates show that the total flux from all the grbs ( including both the triggered ones and the untriggered ones ) reach a level of @xmath3@xcite , which depends on the luminosity function and redshift distribution that are used .",
    "these estimates made simplified assumptions about some properties of grbs , e.g. assuming the same photon spectrum for every grbs , and do not consider the existing icecube limit on triggered grbs . to overcome this simplification , we here present a new approach to calculate the diffuse neutrino flux .",

    "the total gamma - ray fluence of grbs in 101000kev above the trigger threshold in our simulated sample is @xmath55 when the number of bursts is normalized to be 482 , which also agree well with the total gamma - ray fluence , @xmath56 , of the observed 482 gbm bursts .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the distribution of the cumulative bolometric fluence @xmath57 above a certain flux @xmath58 for the subsample of both triggered and untriggered grbs . as is shown , the total gamma ray fluence of the untriggered grbs ( @xmath59 ) is 2 - 3 times larger than that of the triggered ones ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "this is mainly due to two aspects .",
    "first , the number of untriggered grbs is much larger than that of triggered grbs , although the luminosity of untriggered grbs is on average much lower than that of triggered grbs ; second , a fraction ( about 35% ) of bright grbs occulted by the earth also contribute to the gamma - ray fluence in the untriggered grbs .",
    "this demonstrates that the total contribution of untriggered grbs can be important .",
    "there is significant variation in the luminosity function and the redshift distribution of grbs in the literature , see e. g. ( * ? ? ?",

    "this luminosity function is obtained based on the assumption that the rate of grbs follows the star formation history given by @xcite , i.e. @xmath70 ] .",
    "we find that the grb sample generated using the above approach with the luminosity function and rate redshift distribution given in l07 contain much more triggered grbs than the observed ones , while the g07 luminosity function in combination with the relevant redshift distribution gives rise to too few triggered grbs . in other words , to maintain the rate of triggered grbs of 250/yr by fermi / gbm , @xmath42 is required to be @xmath71 and @xmath72 for l07 and g07 respectively , which are beyond the @xmath73 error of the best  fit values ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 for l07 and g07 correspondingly ) .",
    "so here we adopt the luminosity function and redshift distribution of w10 in generating the grb sample in our simulation .",
    "to illustrate the dependence of neutrino flux on the parameters , we first present an analytical approximation of calculating the neutrino flux .",
    "it has been suggested that protons can be accelerated up to @xmath76ev through internal or external shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the accelerated protons collide with the fireball photons in the same region and produce charged pions . the charged pions decay into four final - state leptons via the processes @xmath77 . in the fireball",
    "comoving frame , the fractional energy loss rate of a proton with lorentz factor @xmath78 via photopion production is @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the speed of light , @xmath81 is the photon energy in the rest frame of the proton and @xmath82 is the threshold energy of photonpion production .",
    "@xmath83 is the cross section of photopion production and @xmath84 is the inelasticity . @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the photon energy and the photon spectrum in the grb comoving frame respectively .",
    "when only the @xmath87 resonance channel for the photopion production is considered , the fraction of the proton energy converted into the pion can be approximated by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the bulk lorentz factor of grb and @xmath90 is the internal shock radius which relates with the bulk lorentz factor and variability time @xmath91 through @xmath92 .",
    "the break energy @xmath93 in the proton spectrum is caused by the break in the photon spectrum .",
    "correspondingly , a break occurs in the neutrino spectrum at energy @xmath94 additionally , there is another break in the neutrino spectrum caused by the synchrotron cooling of charged pions in the magnetic field of the dissipative fireball , which can be written as @xmath95 the final neutrino spectrum ( single flavor ) of a grb is approximately a three - section power law with two breaks at @xmath96 and @xmath97 respectively , i.e. , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the ratio between the energy in the accelerated protons and the radiation energy , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are respectively the maximum and minimum energy of accelerated protons , and @xmath102 is the bolometric ( 1kev10mev ) gamma - ray fluence of the grb .",
    "the factor 1/8 comes from the fact that half of the produced pions are charged pions and each neutrino takes about 1/4 of the pion s energy .      in our numerical calculation , besides the @xmath87 resonance channel , we also consider the contribution from the direct pion channel and the multi pion channel .",
    "the cross  section for photopion production is taken from @xcite and the branching ratio of each channel is approximated as the same in h12 .",
    "muon cooling , pion cooling and neutrino oscillation effects are also included in the calculation .",
    "we calculate the grb neutrino flux within the standard internal shock model , i.e. , we use @xmath92 , similar to the treatment by the icecube collaboration @xcite .",
    "we consider two cases of the choice of the bulk lorentz factor @xmath89 , one is the relation @xmath103 that is obtained by @xcite , and another is the benchmark choice , i.e. @xmath104 for all grbs . as in h12 , we fix @xmath105 at 0.01s .",
    "we assume the accelerated proton spectrum to be a power law with an index of @xmath106 .",
    "the baryon ratio is taken to be @xmath107 .",
    "we calculate the neutrino fluence from each grb in the generated sample and the aggregated neutrino fluence from all the triggered grbs in the sample is shown in fig.3 . to compare with the icecube limit from the combined analysis of ic40 and ic59 for 215 grbs , we have multiplied the aggregated fluence by a factor of 215/@xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the number of triggered grbs in our sample . the aggregated neutrino fluence peaks around 1pev and reach a level of @xmath110gev@xmath40 for both choices of @xmath89 . for comparison , we also show the fluence limit of ic40 + 59 in fig.3 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the 90% upper limit on the fluence is obtained by requiring that the upgoing muon neutrino event number angle - averaged effective area for ic40 and ic59 in the calculation .",

    "observed by ic40 + 59 should be smaller than @xmath111 .",
    "the non - detection of neutrinos by ic40 + 59 implies @xmath112 .",
    "we note that the aggregated neutrino fluence of 215 grbs in our former work h12 ( see fig .  2 in h12 )",
    "is a factor of two lower and peaks at higher energy .",
    "the difference is due to that , in that work the luminosity and bulk lorentz factor of all the grbs without measured redshift are fixed as @xmath113ergs@xmath15 and @xmath114 respectively .",
    "the diffuse neutrino flux can be obtained by multiplying the aggregated neutrino fluence of the all  sky grbs occurred in one year by a factor of @xmath115 .",
    "4 presents the diffuse neutrino flux from all grbs in our generated sample ( solid lines ) , which consists of the flux contributed by the triggered grbs ( dashed line ) and the flux contributed by untriggered grbs ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "the top panel corresponds to the case that assumes @xmath103 @xcite and the bottom to the case of @xmath104 . in both cases , the total flux around pev energy",
    "are @xmath116 .",
    "the flux produced by the untriggered grbs is about a factor of two higher than that of the triggered ones .    in fig .  5 ,",
    "we show the contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux by untriggered grbs with different luminosity separately . as can be seen , grbs in the intermediate luminosity range ( @xmath117 ) contribute the largest fraction of the diffuse neutrino flux in both cases of the choice of the bulk lorentz factor .",
    "these grbs do not trigger the detectors either due to occurring at relatively high redshifts , and/or due to having high spectral peaks ( e.g. , @xmath118 ) .",
    "besides , the occulted bright grbs also contribute a significant fraction to the total neutrino flux .",
    "the icecube collaboration recently reported the detection of two cascade neutrinos in the range 110 pev@xcite , which are likely to be electron ( or anti - electron ) neutrinos .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed to explain the origin of these two neutrinos @xcite .",
    "since the energies of the reported two neutrinos are close to the peak energy of the typical grb neutrino spectrum , we here study the possibility that they originate from diffuse grb neutrinos . in studying the possible grb origin",
    ", one must assure that the stacked neutrino flux of those 215 triggered grbs observed by icecube do not exceed the ic40 + 59 limit .",
    "the expected number of diffuse neutrinos from grbs in the energy range 110pev can be obtained by @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the number spectrum of diffuse electron neutrinos ( in unit of @xmath121 ) and @xmath122 is the icecube exposure of electron neutrinos at ultra - high energies in 2 years ( 20102012)@xcite , which includes the contribution by the glashow resonance .",
    "notably , since the analysis approach for diffuse cascade neutrinos is different from that for upgoing neutrinos from triggered grbs , the icecube effective area is significantly different",
    ". based on the total diffuse neutrino flux we obtained above , we get @xmath123 for the case of @xmath124 and @xmath125 for the case of @xmath104 ( @xmath107 is assumed ) .",
    "since the non  detection of grbs by ic40 + 59 implies @xmath126 ( see  3.2 ) , we have @xmath127 or @xmath128 respectively , which is insufficient to account for the reported two neutrinos .",
    "there is still a small possibility that these two neutrinos arise from , for instance , some very strong grbs that happen to be occulted by the earth and hence do not trigger the detectors .",
    "in addition , strong statistical fluctuation can also possibly lead to detection of one or two events .",
    "there is significant variation in the luminosity function @xmath129 and the rate distribution with redshift @xmath9 in the literature(e.g .",
    "@xcite , g07 , l07 , w10 , @xcite ) .",
    "the variation may be caused by different approaches in obtaining the luminosity function and different spectral properties as well as trigger thresholds being used in the calculation .    under the requirement that the total neutrino fluence from the triggered grbs do not exceed the upper limit placed by icecube",
    ", the possibility that grbs are responsible for the two events increases if the fraction of neutrino flux from the untriggered grbs increases .",
    "this requires more dim and/or distant grbs to take place .",
    "therefore , luminosity functions with steep slopes or rate distribution with higher rate at high redshift are favorable for producing more dim , untriggered grbs .",
    "as the slopes in the luminosity function of l07 below and above the break luminosity @xmath130 are shallower than that in w10 , adopting this luminosity function will lead to a smaller fraction of untriggered grbs .",
    "however , the rate redshift distribution used in l07 suggests higher rate of grbs at high redshift , which , on the contrary , will lead to a higher fraction of untriggered grbs .",
    "we estimate that the neutrino flux produced by untriggered grbs is about 90% of that of triggered grbs for the luminosity function and rate distribution in l07 . for the luminosity function and rate distribution in g07",
    ", this factor increases to 2.5 because of the steep slope in the luminosity function of g07 and higher grb rate at high redshift . even considering the variation in the luminosity function and rate distribution in the literature ,",
    "the diffuse neutrino flux from grbs may be still insufficient to account for the two neutrinos .",
    "other possible sources of dim , untriggered grbs are low  luminosity grbs ( llgrbs ) and population iii ( pop iii ) grbs .",
    "llgrbs are grbs with luminosity @xmath131ergs@xmath15 , which constitute a distinct population from the normal grbs(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although only several cases are observed within @xmath132mpc so far , which is mainly due to their low luminosity , the intrinsic local event rate of llgrbs is suggested to be about two orders of magnitude higher than that of the normal grbs(e.g . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the large local population could compensate for the low energy in llgrbs , and lead to a significant amount of neutrino flux ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in @xcite , we calculated the diffuse neutrino flux from llgrbs for different llgrb luminosity functions and found that the flux can reach a level of @xmath133 or higher around pev energies , depending on the parameters of llgrbs that are used , such as the choice of @xmath89 .",
    "we also found that most llgrbs are untriggered and the energy budget of gamma rays in untriggered llgrbs can be several times larger than that in the triggered ones .",
    "thus more than 0.20.4 electron neutrinos in the range 110pev could come from llgrbs in principle .",
    "however , since the origin of llgrbs are not clear ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the properties of llgrbs have large uncertainties , we should be cautious about this estimate .",
    "pop iii grbs are thought to arise from the death of the first stars that locate at high redshift ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "it is suggested that the their luminosity is typically a few times @xmath135 and their duration is @xmath136s@xcite , so they may release energy up to @xmath137erg in one burst . at such large distances",
    ", their gamma - ray flux is below @xmath138 , so they may not be able to trigger current grb detectors .",
    "thus , if pop iii grbs can produce high energy neutrinos , these neutrinos will contribute to the diffuse background .",
    "it has been shown by @xcite that the neutrino flux in 1 - 10 pev range can reach @xmath139 , or even @xmath140 when some preferred parameters are used , e.g. , with large progenitor mass and/or high interstellar medium density . however , since the flux peaks at @xmath141 ev , one would expect even stronger flux at @xmath142 ev , which is inconsistent with the non - detection by icecube at such energies .",
    "moreover , the rate of pop iii grbs is quite uncertain .",
    "the pop iii grb rate adopted in @xcite is from @xcite , which obtains a much higher rate than that in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "so whether pop iii grbs are responsible for the two neutrinos remains to be studied .",
    "finally we note that we only consider the neutrino emission under the standard internal shock model . for other models for the grb prompt emission , such as the photosphere emission models ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or magnetically reconnection models , the efficiency for producing neutrinos @xmath143 is different ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , due to different dissipation radii @xmath90 involved .",
    "however , the ratio between the flux from triggered grbs and that from untriggered grbs is not expected to change .",
    "therefore , the diffuse neutrino flux can not be readily increased under the constraint that no neutrinos are detected from from triggered grbs .",
    "in this paper , we studied the diffuse neutrino emission from grbs in light of the recent report that two pev cascade events are detected by icecube .",
    "we first generate a grb sample that reproduces the realistic properties of the observed grbs by fermi / gbm . an accompanying sample of untrigged grbs is generated simultaneously .",
    "then we calculated the neutrino flux from the triggered and the untriggered grbs in the sample within the standard internal shock scenario .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the spectral properties ( i.e. the spectral peak and indices ) of every individual grbs can be taken into account properly in the calculation .",
    "we found that the neutrino flux from the untriggered grbs is about a factor of two larger than that of the triggered grbs . under the constraint of the non - detection of any upgoing muon neutrinos from 215",
    "triggered grbs in the ic40 + 59 combined analysis , the total diffuse neutrinos flux ( single flavor ) can reach a level of @xmath144 at most .",
    "such a flux can only give rise to @xmath145 cascade neutrino events in 110pev for icecube 2-years exposure .",
    "low  luminosity grbs and/or pop iii grbs can also contribute to the diffuse neutrino flux , but large uncertainties in their properties prevents us from drawing a firm conclusion .",

    "<S> we study the possibility that these pev neutrinos are produced by gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , paying special attention to the contribution by untriggered grbs that elude detection due to their low photon flux . based on the luminosity function , rate distribution with redshift and spectral properties of grbs , we generate , using monte - carlo simulation , a grb sample that reproduce the observed fluence distribution of fermi / gbm grbs and an accompanying sample of untriggered grbs simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino flux of every individual grbs is calculated in the standard internal shock scenario , so that the accumulative flux of the whole samples can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the neutrino flux in pev energies produced by untriggered grbs is about 2 times higher than that produced by the triggered ones . </S>",
    "<S> considering the existing icecube limit on the neutrino flux of triggered grbs , we find that the total flux of triggered and untriggered grbs can reach at most a level of @xmath0 , which is insufficient to account for the reported two pev neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> possible contributions to diffuse neutrinos by low - luminosity grbs and the earliest population of grbs are also discussed . </S>"
