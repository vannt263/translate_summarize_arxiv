    "redshifts and consequent results ( e.g. , luminosity distance , look - back time , and angular distance ) are the basis of nearly all observational astronomical studies of extragalactic objects ( e.g. , luminosity function , mass function , large - scale structures , and galaxy evolution ) , progress on which would be greatly hampered by the lack of redshift information . the most reliable way to obtain secure redshifts is by taking spectra and identifying emission ( or absorption ) lines . however , this approach of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts ( ) is observation time demanding , and proves to be quite challenging especially for very faint objects , e.g. , the caltech faint galaxy redshift survey is 92% complete down to = 24  mag in the hubble deep field - north and to = 23  mag in the flanking fields ( cohen et al .",
    "2000 ) ; however , when targeting slightly fainter objects over a larger area , the team keck treasury redshift survey obtained secure spectroscopic redshifts for only 53% of their targets that are brighter than @xmath10  mag in the  field ( wirth et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "therefore another approach , obtaining photometric redshifts ( ) of good quality , is of great value .",
    "determining photometric redshifts with broad - band and/or medium - band imaging observations is able to capture very faint objects in a time - efficient manner , e.g. , dahlen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) reached a 5@xmath11 detection limit of ( _ hst_/acs f850lp ) @xmath12  mag in their  catalog in the  field . generally speaking , there are two classes of methods for calculating photometric redshifts : empirical and template spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting .",
    "the former make use of a large set of spectroscopic objects to calibrate some empirical relations between redshifts and photometry ( i.e. , photometric magnitudes and/or colors ) , e.g. , connolly et al .",
    "( 1995 ) simply fit  as a linear or quadratic function of magnitudes ; collister et al .",
    "( 2004 ) developed their code annz based on an artificial neural network method .",
    "the empirical methods prove to be accurate ; however they need a large number of training spectroscopic samples and potentially have large uncertainties for faint sources for which  is sparsely sampled ( walcher et al .",
    "2010 ) . to evaluate the quality of  derived by empirical methods more accurately and realistically",
    ", the authors often need to perform blind tests , i.e. , randomly picking out a subsample of the  sources for training and the rest for  quality evaluation .",
    "the template sed fitting methods utilize library template sets and fit photometry at a series of redshift grid points to estimate .",
    "typically , no apparent training procedures are involved , the results are thus believed to be largely unbiased , but the choice of templates is essential in determining quality  estimates .",
    "there are additional factors such as resolution of photometric sed ( depending on the number and bandwidths of filters ) and wavelength coverage of filters that affect  quality .",
    "a high - resolution photometric sed might capture some detailed spectroscopic features such as emission or absorption lines , thereby narrowing the possible redshift range .",
    "wide wavelength coverage could eliminate the degeneracy of seds , thus reducing the probability of catastrophic failures .",
    "the largest uncertainty in  estimation lies in photometric errors , especially for faint sources where the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is low ( e.g. , dahlen et al .",
    "2010 , 2013 ) .",
    "furthermore , images of different bands are often obtained with different instruments and their point spread functions ( psfs ) might differ significantly .",
    "therefore the challenge is to measure the same fraction of light ( i.e. , accurate colors ) for a source in images with different psfs .",
    "the method of psf matching has proven to be effective in obtaining uniform photometry across different instruments and filters , with large variations in psfs and pixel scales taken into account ( e.g. , cardamone et al .",
    "2010 ; dahlen et al .",
    "another issue in photometry is blending .",
    "when two sources are close to each other ( due to projection effects ) , photometry of one source might be contaminated by the light from the other source ( e.g. , dahlen et al . 2010 ) ; on some occasions two such sources might even be detected as one single source if their angular separation is sufficiently small ( i.e. , comparable to the angular resolution of the observations ) .    in this paper , we perform psf - matched photometry and determine photometric redshifts for over one hundred thousand objects in the hawaii - hubble deep field - north (; capak et al .",
    "2004 ; c04 hereafter ) that is an intensively - observed field .",
    "centered at @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the 0.4-deg@xmath1  contains the  ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) and  ( brandt et al .",
    "2001 ; alexander et al .",
    "2003 , a03 hereafter ) fields .",
    "rafferty et al .",
    "( 2011 ) calculated  for the 48,858 sources in the c04 catalog , using photometry that is not psf - matched and was collected from several origins .",
    "the recent project ( skelton et al .  2014 ) derived  based on deep  data and some ground - based observations in the  field , which covers a much smaller area than the .",
    "given the fact that the  is a premium field with an enormous investment of multi - wavelength observations ( in particular the recent addition of deep infrared data ) , it is imperative to produce a catalog that presents both psf - matched photometry and photometric redshifts for the _ entire _  field .",
    "therefore , we collect images in 17 broad bands from ultraviolet (  band , @xmath15 ) to mid - infrared ( irac @xmath16 ) and derive  using the eazy code ( i.e. , a sed fitting code developed by brammer et al .",
    "2008 ; b08 hereafter ) based on 15 bands ( excluding irac @xmath17 m and @xmath18 m ; see section  [ sec : zp ] ) in this field .",
    "our main procedures are outlined in figure  [ fig : flow ] .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we describe the imaging and spectroscopic data in section  [ sec : data ] , astrometry correction in section  [ sec : astrom ] , psf - matching procedures in section  [ sec : psf ] , and photometry extraction in section  [ sec : photo ] , respectively . in section  [ sec : photoz ] , we present the procedures used to derive  and evaluate our  quality .",
