    "one can learn a great deal about the pairing mechanism of a superconductor from the electronic properties in the presence of inhomogeneity , such as vortices and impurities .",
    "although multiple - band superconductivity was first studied almost 50 years ago , @xcite the structure of a vortex in multiband superconductors has not been well understood , especially when impurities are present .",
    "the best material that has been discovered so far for studying multiband superconductivity is mgb@xmath0.@xcite the consensus is that superconductivity is driven by electron - phonon interactions , and that it can be well described by a two - band model , with the `` strong '' @xmath1 band ( energy gap @xmath2 mev ) and the `` weak '' @xmath3 band ( @xmath4 mev).@xcite the two energy gaps vanish at a common transition temperature @xmath5 ( refs .  ) and there is evidence of induced superconductivity in the @xmath3 band.@xcite    the one unusual aspect of this material as a multiband superconductor is the effect of impurities .",
    "the standard theory@xcite tells us that interband scattering by nonmagnetic impurities should reduce @xmath5 and the gap ratio .",
    "mazin and co - workers,@xcite however , have shown theoretically that this does not apply to mgb@xmath0 , due to different symmetries of the @xmath1 and @xmath3 orbitals , and hence negligible interband scattering .",
    "moreover , impurities or defects , in particular those at mg - sites which tend to occur more easily than at b - sites , affect only the @xmath3 band strongly .",
    "indeed , many experiments have shown that the @xmath1 and @xmath3 bands are essentially in the ballistic and diffusive limit , respectively.@xcite even in samples in which the @xmath1 band is influenced by impurities substantially , two - gap superconductivity is retained.@xcite the question of whether or not the two gaps merge in dirty samples has not yet been settled.@xcite    due to induced superconductivity and possibly also owing to these peculiar effects of impurities , the electronic structure around a vortex in mgb@xmath0 has been found to exhibit intriguing properties .",
    "_ et al._,@xcite by tunneling along the @xmath6 axis , have probed the vortex core structure in the @xmath3 band .",
    "the local density of states ( ldos ) was found to be completely flat as a function of energy at the vortex core , showing no sign of bound states .",
    "also the ` core size ' ( @xmath750 nm ) as measured by a decay length of the zero - bias ldos turned out to be much longer than expected from @xmath8 ( @xmath710nm).@xcite moreover , the existence of two effective coherence lengths in mgb@xmath0 has been suggested by the @xmath9sr measurement of a vortex lattice.@xcite there has been , however , no experiment directly probing the @xmath1 band in the vortex state , and the electronic structure around a vortex in the @xmath1 band is yet to be determined .",
    "theoretically , the vortex structure in a two - band superconductor has been studied in terms of two clean bands@xcite and two dirty bands.@xcite neither of these models , however , applies to many mgb@xmath0 samples , which have the clean @xmath1 and dirty @xmath3 bands .",
    "recently , we have formulated a unique model for a multiband superconductor with both a clean and a dirty band.@xcite we have studied the effects of induced superconductivity and impurities in the weak diffusive band on the electronic properties in the strong ballistic band around a vortex . a particularly intriguing feature found in this model is the possibility of bound states near the gap edge in the ballistic band in the vortex core , in addition to the well - known caroli - de gennes - matricon bound states.@xcite such bound states do not exist in a single ballistic band , and they arise solely from coupling to the diffusive band .",
    "our model has also been applied to study the kramer - pesch effect@xcite in coupled clean and dirty bands.@xcite it has been found that the kramer - pesch effect is induced in the dirty band , which is absent when there is no coupling with the clean band .",
    "thus , hybridization of ballistic and diffusive bands can lead to unusual properties of a multiband superconductor , and the vortex core structure is an example in which the effects of induced superconductivity and impurities manifest clearly .    in this work , we make an extensive study of the electronic structure in the vicinity of a vortex in a strong ballistic band , under the influence of hybridization with a weak diffusive band .",
    "our model is based on coupled eilenberger and usadel equations , which are solved directly and numerically .",
    "we assume that interband scattering by impurities is negligible and that the two bands are coupled only by the pairing interaction , as justified for typical mgb@xmath0 samples .",
    "unique features of the order parameter , the current density , and the vortex core spectrum are examined in detail . in particular , we study the development of the gap - edge bound states as various physical parameters are varied .",
    "although this work has been motivated by the impurity effects @xcite and the stm measurement of the vortex state in mgb@xmath0 , @xcite our model is general and applicable to any superconductor in which ballistic and diffusive bands are coupled mainly by the pairing interaction .",

    "another important observation is that the current density in the @xmath3 band has strong temperature dependence also far outside the core . on the contrary ,",

    "this bulk behaviour of the current density in the two bands also explains the dominance of the @xmath3-band contribution in the bulk for relatively large @xmath95 and @xmath171 . for large @xmath220 , the current - density ratio approaches",
    "@xmath276 thus the @xmath3-band contribution to the current density dominates when @xmath277 .",

    "in conclusion , we have studied a model recently introduced by us@xcite for describing a multiband superconductor with a ballistic and a diffusive band in terms of coupled eilenberger and usadel equations .",
    "both equations were solved directly and numerically until self - consistency of the order parameters was achieved .",
    "we have studied the effects of induced superconductivity and impurities in the weak diffusive ( @xmath3 ) band on the order parameter , the current density , and the spectral properties of the strong ballistic ( @xmath1 ) band .",

    "although the two bands are coupled by the pairing interaction , the order parameters in the two bands can have very different length scales .",
    "when the coulomb interaction dominates in the @xmath3 band , the order parameter in the @xmath1 band has a longer recovery length than that in the @xmath3 band . in this case",

    "( [ coresize ] ) ] smaller than that in the @xmath1 band . furthermore ,",
    "when coupled to the diffusive band , the order parameter in the ballistic @xmath1 band is suppressed by temperature more strongly than in the single - band case .",
    "the zero - bias ldos in the two bands can have very different decay lengths , the one in the @xmath3 band being larger than that in the @xmath1 band . as the induced",
    "superconductivity in the @xmath3 band becomes stronger , the core area widens in the @xmath1 band and ( more ) gap - edge bound states appear .",
    "moreover , an increase in the fermi - surface density of states in the @xmath3 band results in an increase in the energy gap and the number of gap - edge bound states in the @xmath1 band . increasing the coulomb repulsion in the @xmath3 band and temperature also enlarges the core area in the @xmath1 band , which results in additional bound states at the gap edge .",
    "the gap - edge bound states have only weak dispersion .",
    "it is thus expected that these bound states are affected only weakly by impurity scattering within the @xmath1 band.@xcite results incorporating impurities in the strong @xmath1 band confirm this statement and will be presented in a future paper.@xcite    the supercurrent density is dominated in the vortex core by the @xmath1-band contribution , and outside the core the @xmath3-band contribution can be substantial , or even dominating over the @xmath1-band current density .",
    "the current density in the @xmath1 band shows the kramer - pesch effect in the core area . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath3 band current density has strong temperature dependence also outside the core .",
    "it exhibits the kramer - pesch effect when the coupling between the two bands is relatively strong .",

    "<S> motivated by the experimental findings on mgb@xmath0 , we assume that superconductivity in the diffusive band is `` weak , '' i.e. , mostly induced . </S>",
    "<S> we examine intriguing features of the order parameter , the current density , and the vortex core spectrum in the `` strong '' ballistic band under the influence of hybridization with the `` weak '' diffusive band . </S>",
    "<S> although the order parameter in the diffusive band is induced , the characteristic length scales in the two bands differ due to coulomb interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the current density in the vortex core is dominated by the contribution from the ballistic band , while outside the core the contribution from the diffusive band can be substantial , or even dominating . </S>",
    "<S> the current density in the diffusive band has strong temperature dependence , exhibiting the kramer - pesch effect when hybridization is strong . </S>",
    "<S> a particularly interesting feature of our model is the possibility of additional bound states near the gap edge in the ballistic band , that are prominent in the vortex centre spectra . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts with the single band case , where there is no gap - edge bound state in the vortex centre . </S>",
    "<S> we find the above - mentioned unique features for parameter values relevant for mgb@xmath0 . </S>"
