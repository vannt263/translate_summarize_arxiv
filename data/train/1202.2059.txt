    "the excitation of surface waves through parametric resonances is one of the oldest pattern - forming processes that goes back to ernst chladni s `` beautiful series of forms assumed by sand , fillings , or other grains when lying upon vibrating plates '' that `` are so striking as to be recalled to the minds of those who have seen them by the slightest reference '' , hans christian rsted s experiments with lycopodium light powders , and michael faraday s `` crispations '' seen in fluids in contact with vibrating surfaces @xcite .",
    "the prototypical example of parametric wave excitation is that of a shallow disc of a liquid rigidly oscillated in the vertical direction . in this",
    "setting the acceleration periodically modulates the effective gravity and for drives of sufficiently large amplitudes a surface wave instability occurs with frequency one half that of the drive @xcite .",
    "such surface waves are termed faraday waves , and the corresponding pattern - forming phenomenon has been seen in numerous newtonian and non - newtonian fluids , colloidal suspensions , ferromagnetic bodies , and , more recently , in superfluids .",
    "after a series of inceptive studies on extended parametric resonances in confined superfluids @xcite , the experimental observation of faraday waves in @xmath1he cells @xcite and @xmath0rb cigar - shaped bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite catalyzed the interest in the nonlinear dynamics of parametrically - driven ultracold gases @xcite .",
    "in addition to the ever - present collective oscillation modes of becs @xcite , their parametric driving can generate soundlike density waves , which are analogous to faraday surface waves .",
    "bec systems also exhibit resonances , and when the driving frequency is close to one of them , forceful resonant waves can develop , eventually taking over the dynamics of the system .",
    "furthermore , inherent nonlinearity of such systems brings about a diverse set of related dynamical phenomena and leads to their complex interplay .",
    "surveying the recent literature for bosonic systems one notices the theoretical investigations into the soliton management in periodic systems @xcite , the emergence and suppression of faraday patterns @xcite , the parametric excitation of resonances @xcite and `` scars '' in becs @xcite , spatially and temporally driven atomic interactions in optical lattices @xcite , quantized vortices induced by spatio - temporally modulated interaction @xcite , stability and decay of bloch oscillations in the presence of time - dependent nonlinearity @xcite , and , quite interestingly , the removal of excitations in becs subject to time - dependent periodic potentials @xcite . on a related topic , the formation of density waves has been predicted for expanding condensates @xcite and the spontaneous formation of density waves has been recently reported for antiferromagnetic becs @xcite .",
    "faraday waves have been analyzed in detail also in superfluid fermionic gases @xcite and it has been shown that the collective modes of 1d fermionic systems can be amplified by parametric resonances to the extent of observing a clear spin - charge separation @xcite .",
