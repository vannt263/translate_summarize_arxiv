    "forthcoming space missions and missions in project ( like astrod , tipo or lator , see @xcite ) will require distance measurements at millimetric level in the solar system .",
    "this corresponds to time transfer at the precision @xmath2 .",
    "as argued in @xcite , this requires a complete solar system metric at the @xmath1  level , in order to describe the laser links involved in such experiments .",
    "this has been proposed in the framework of the general relativity ( gr ) theory in @xcite , leading to an appropriate extention of the metric recommanded by the iau2000 resolution @xcite .",
    "the relative amplitude of the relativistic effects is of the order of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are some characteristic mass and distance .",
    "the so - called first order terms are of order @xmath6 , the second order terms of order @xmath7 . in the inner solar system , @xmath6 is typically of the order @xmath8 , and can be sensitively greater ( @xmath9 ) for photons entering well inside mercury s orbit , and can even be as large as @xmath10 for photons grazzing the sun .",
    "on the other hand , gr faces a lot of difficulties both at the solar system level ( pioneer anomaly , fly - by anomaly ) and at the cosmological level ( universe expansion accelarate).hence a new surge of interest in alternative gravity theories .  among these ,",
    "the scalar - tensor ( st ) theories deserve a particular interest , since the gravitational sector of fundamental theories , like string or kaluza - klein theories , turns out to be described by a metric tensor plus a scalar field @xcite ( brans - dicke or not @xcite ) .",
    "alternative gravity metrics diverge from the gr one at the @xmath11 level.this divergence is quantified by the post - newtonian ( pn ) @xmath12 factor ( @xmath13 in gr ) entering the @xmath11 term in the space - space components of the metric tensor . from the present observations ,",
    "@xmath14 can at best reach values of the order of @xmath15 @xcite .  besides , some theoretical considerations strongly suggest @xmath16 could be driven from any  initial  value to unity by the cosmological expansion ( more precisely , st theories are driven to gr , as soon as these theories fulfil some ( not very constraining ) conditions ) , and also that the @xmath17 current value could be of order @xmath9 or @xmath8 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath1 terms are typically @xmath18 to @xmath19  smaller than @xmath11 terms . hence , as much as @xmath1 space - space metric terms have to be taken into account in light propagation problems , it is necessary to include also a possible divergence from gr in the proposed metric , at least in the @xmath11 terms , for numerical coherence .",
    "hence it is required to upgrade the ( extended version @xcite of ) iau2000 metric to the st case .    in principle , this would call for new definitions of multipolar moments at the @xmath11 level .",
    "but other publications porposed @xmath11 mutlipolar moments in st theories @xcite or in a parametrized post - newtonian framework @xcite .",
    "thus we do not discuss this point in this paper and focus only on the @xmath1 metric side of the problem .    in section [ sec : term ] , one defines a terminology relevant to the considered problem .",
    "since the einstein conformal representation plays a central role in the approach followed in this paper , the section [ sec : eivsjo ] is devoted to the conformal link between the representations of the st theories , and the related notations we will use . section [ sec : tfe ] is dedicated to the derivation of the st field equations up to @xmath20 terms . in section [ sec : omega0 ] , these field equations are rewritten up to @xmath21 terms , for applications taking explicitely our present knowledge on st theories into account .",
    "finally , considering applications to solar system - like systems , one defines strongly hierarchized system in section [ sec : hierarchy ] .",
    "this is made by defining a quantity @xmath22 that quantifies how much the system is gravitationally dominated by its most massive body .",
    "accordingly , the field equations are rewritten up to @xmath23 terms . in this case , the explicit solution that can be used in relevant applications is written in well - suited coordinates .",
    "the pn approximation is based on the assumption of a weak gravitational field and weak velocities for both the sources and the ( test ) body ( ie .",
    "velocities of the order @xmath24 or less , @xmath4 being some caracteristic mass of the system ) .",
    "it formally consists in looking for solutions under the form of an expansion in powers of @xmath25 .",

    "of course , this does nt change the metric , but the terms to be considered in the metric components are not the same as in the pn / bm problem .",
    "indeed , the terms leading to @xmath27 terms in the equation of motion of a test particle moving with relativistic velocity are terms of order @xmath27 in all the components @xmath33 ( ie . in both @xmath29 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) . in this case",

    "since the use of the harmonic gauge ( hg ) is recommended by the iau , let us consider the field equations in this gauge .",
    "of course one has to specify the representation in which the hg is prescribed . the jordan hg condition reads @xmath129 and it leads to , for the space ( @xmath130 ) component @xmath131 as expected from known results in gr @xcite , this condition reduces to a triviality in the case @xmath132 .",

    ", the three first equations of ( [ fieldeq2 ] ) take the reduced form @xmath138 while the equation corresponding to the scalar degree of freedom and the harmonic constraints read @xmath139 or equivalently ( after elimination of the scalar field @xmath140 ) @xmath141 the last equation refers to the fact that @xmath142 ( given by ( [ eq : ji0 ] ) ) is a gradient .",

    "in the inner solar system , the gravitational field is such that @xmath143 on the other hand , from experimental / observational constraints @xcite @xmath144 this means @xmath145 ( or @xmath146 ) could be considered numerically as a @xmath147  ( at best ) order quantity .",

    "in the general relativistic @xmath166-body problem , multipolar moments of a body @xmath167 are defined in the coordinate system in which this body is , in some sense , at rest .",
    "these moments are affected by coordinate transforms through a `` lorentz - like length contraction effect '' .",
    "these effects being of order @xmath168 , where @xmath169  is the relative velocity between the two frames , the induced effects in the metric components are of order @xmath170 .    in strongly hierarchized systems ,",
    "the velocity of the body @xmath162 is of the order of@xmath171where @xmath172 is the most massive planet ( and @xmath173  the distance between @xmath172  and the star ) .",

    "hence all these terms are , at best , of order @xmath180    let us also point out that , since at this level the metric depends on time through the positions of the star and the planets only , the operator @xmath181 is of order @xmath182 .",
    "hence , equations ( [ eq : eqjh1])-([equ : hi ] ) lead to    @xmath183    with gauge conditions    @xmath184    related to this , @xmath185 defined in @xcite leads to numerically negligible terms ( see ( 11.4.8 ) in @xcite for the st version ) .      in the solar system ,",
    "the most massive body @xmath162 is the sun and one has @xmath186 thus , it is legitimate to consider the solar system as a strongly hierarchized system .",

    "hence , taking advantage that the solar multipolar terms are very weak , the solution of the field equations ( [ eq : eqjh2b ] )  suitable for millimetric accuracy in propagation of light  with the harmonic constraints ( [ equ : h0b]-[equ : hib ] ) given in barycentric coordinates turns to be    @xmath190 - \\frac{2 w_s^2}{c^4}+o\\left ( c^{-5},\\omega_{0}^{-1}c^{-4},\\mu c^{-4},j^s_2 c^{-4}\\right ) \\label{eq : hugei}\\\\ g_{0i}&=&- 2\\frac{\\gamma+1}{c^3 } w^i(t,\\vec{x})+o\\left ( c^{-5},\\mu c^{-4},j^s_2 c^{-4}\\right ) \\label{eq : wifin}\\\\ g_{ij}&= & \\left ( 1 + \\frac{2 \\gamma}{c^2 } \\left[w_0(t,\\vec{x})+w_l(t,\\vec{x})\\right]+\\frac{2 w_s^2}{c^4 } \\right ) \\delta_{ij}+4 \\frac{w_{ij}}{c^4}+o\\left ( c^{-5},\\omega_{0}^{-1}c^{-4},\\mu c^{-4},j^s_2 c^{-4}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath191 @xmath192 \\label{eq : wifin}\\\\ w_s(\\vec{x } ) & = & g_{eff } \\frac{m_s}{r_s}\\\\ w_{ij}(\\vec{x } ) & = & \\frac{1}{4 } \\left(g_{eff } \\frac{m_s}{r_s}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{(x^i - x_s^i)(x^j - x_s^j)}{r_s^2 } - \\delta_{ij } \\right ) \\label{eq : hugef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where one has put @xmath193 @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 being repectively the mass , the position and the velocity in barycentric coordinates , and the total angular momentum of the body @xmath63 .",

    "the differences with the iau2000 metric @xcite lie in the presence of both the pn parameter @xmath16 and the @xmath1 space - space metric term .",
    "the multipolar term @xmath203 in @xmath32 that has been neglected in the iau2000 metric  thanks to numerical considerations in the 1pn / bm case  has to be considered here as well .    in a same way",
    ", the multipolar terms in the time - space component of the metric ( @xmath31 ) could also lead to measurable effects .",
    "thus , one may have to consider them .    while the rotational term in the time - space component of the metric is given as the usual lense - thirring term , slight modifications ( spin multipoles ) can in principle appear due to the differential rotation of the bodies .",
    "however , solar seismology suggests @xcite that the sun s tachoclyne is at about @xmath204 sun radius .",
    "then , the mass concerned by the differential rotation is of order of a few percent of the total mass and thus , it might not lead to measurable effects .",
    "but , incidentally , time transfer and laser ranging experiments could suggest a way to test our knowledges on the solar interior dynamics , independently of results coming from solar seismology .",
    "another point coming from the solar seismology is that the solar core ( @xmath205 sun radius ) may rotate faster than the external layers @xcite .",
    "since , the core represents a great amount of the total mass , this could affect the propagation of light at a level depending on the total angular momentum value ( @xmath206 ) .",
    "depending on the solar internal structure model , this may happen at the millimetric level . using a simplified model ,",
    "we show in appendix [ app : diffrot ] how a non - rigid rotation of the sun could also affect the metric .",
    "let us note that @xmath203 can be neglected for inner solar system millimetric laser ranging experiments , such as mars laser ranging for instance .",
    "we emphasize again that neiher the @xmath207 parameter nor the @xmath208 parameter are required ( @xmath208  corresponding sometimes to @xmath209 @xcite or @xmath210 @xcite  being some pn parameter often considered in the @xmath1 space - space metric term @xcite ) .",
    "this is because both the former and the latter give too small deviations from gr to be considered in @xmath1 solar system photon s trajectories calculations .",
    "this fact is known for the former from @xcite and is then obvious for the latter since it is a function of @xmath16 and @xmath207 in ( non - massive-)st theories considered here ( as expressed in equation ( [ jmetric ] ) ) .",
    "finally , let us point that , because of the orders of magnitude in the solar system problem , while we must know the global ( ie .",
    "bcrs ) 2pn / rm metric for experiments of interest  which is given in ( [ eq : hugei])-([eq : hugef ] )  it is not necessary to have the local ( planet ) 2pn / rm metrics , insofar such metrics are needed .",
    "this means that the usual local 1,5pn / bm metrics ( @xcite for gr and @xcite for st ) are accurate enough for overlaping local coordinates charts with the global one .",
    "hence , it is not needed to develop a complete theory of reference frames at the 2pn / rm level as long as one is interrested in millimetric laser ranging experiments in the solar system .",
    "laser ranging and time transfer in solar system could be able to reveal smoking gun arguments against gr by measuring accurately deviation from gr in well - suited experiments such as lator @xcite , tipo @xcite , astrod @xcite , odyssey @xcite or sagas @xcite .",
    "such experiments will require distance measurements at millimetric level .",
    "as emphasized in @xcite , @xmath1 terms in @xmath32 then have to be taken into account .",
    "but only monopolar terms have to be considered in the @xmath1 part of the metric .",
    "thus , definition of multipolar moments is required at the @xmath11 level only .",
    "such definitions are available for gr and ts theories @xcite and are in progress in the ppn formalism @xcite . moreover , since the solar system is strongly hierarchized , only the solar monopolar term has to be considered in the @xmath1 part of the metric .",
    "hence , from numerical considerations that spring from present constraints on the post - newtonian parameters and from the solar system specificities , the 2pn / rm metric ( [ eq : hugei])-([eq : hugef ] ) is sufficient for the next generation of experiments dealing with propagation of light in the solar system .",

    "recent results coming from solar seismology suggest that the solar core rotates faster than the external layers @xcite . in the following toy model we consider the mass density as spherical ( @xmath211 ) . as usual in solar models",
    "@xcite , we make the distinction between three main regions : the core region ( @xmath212 $ ] , where @xmath213 is the core radius ) , the radiative region ( @xmath214 $ ] , where @xmath215 is the tachoclyne radius ) and the convection region ( @xmath216 $ ] , where @xmath217 is the sun radius ) . @xmath218 being the angular velocity , we modelize the differential rotation as follows @xmath219 with @xmath220 where @xmath221\\\\ & = & 0~ \\mbox { everywhere else},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and where we modelize the differential rotation by a simple model in accordance with the usual model @xcite @xmath222 where @xmath223 and @xmath224 are constants , @xmath172 being any of the three previous regions ( @xmath225 , @xmath47 or @xmath226 ) .",
    "solar seismology suggests that the radiative region rotates as a solid  meaning @xmath227 ( ie .",
    "@xmath228 ) . however , since we are interested in testing solar seismology results , let us relax this assumption .",
    "let us write @xmath229 with @xmath230 @xmath231 being the sun spin part of @xmath232 in ( [ eq : wifin ] ) .",

    ", we will refer to this term as the post - lense - thirring term .    as an illustration ,",
    "let us consider the following toy model .",
    "assume ( 1 ) the density decreases linearly with the distance to the center of the sun ( 2 ) the differential rotation is independent of the distance from the center .",
    "now consider that the photons  used for the time transfer @xcite  graze the sun ( ie .",
    "@xmath236 , where @xmath237 is the impact parameter and @xmath238 a parameter ideally close to 1 ) .",
    "then the effect of the post - lense - thirring term is about @xmath239 times the usual lense - thirring effect .",
    "however , realistic models of the sun and its rotation are expected to substantially decrease the value of this possible effect .",
    "but , this point should be verified and a specific study , that consider different realistic models of the sun , should be done in order to clarify this issue ."
