    "whereas the bulk behavior of homogeneous ( charged @xcite and uncharged @xcite ) colloidal suspensions is rather well understood , the situation for its inhomogeneous counterpart , such as that emerging in an adsorption process , is less clear .",
    "potential applications of adsorption of charged colloidal particles ( macroions ) can vary from technological processes such as surface coating @xcite to biological material problems .",
    "@xcite from a fundamental point of view , the tremendous long - ranged coulomb interaction that sets in represents a formidable theoretical challenge .",
    "consequently , a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of macroion adsorption is justified and needed .",
    "on one hand , experiments @xcite and the well known mean field gouy - chapman theory @xcite seem to nicely agree for the ion distribution of an aqueous monovalent electrolyte near planar charged interfaces , as long as non - specific forces as well as excluded volume effects are negligible .",
    "on the other hand , if the solution contains highly multivalent and/or large sized ions , then the gouy - chapman theory may severely qualitatively fail .",
    "a crucial missing ingredient in this theory is the inclusion of the finite size of the macroions that can lead to non - trivial phenomena , such as substrate s surface charge reversal , already with monovalent ions .",
    "@xcite the lateral macroion - macroion electrostatic correlations that are also absent in a mean field theory can be attenuated ( and even become marginal ) at sufficiently high salt content , in contrast to excluded volume effects . in the past , gonzles - mozuelos and medina - noyola @xcite used integral equations to address the problem of macroions near repulsive / attractive charged walls interacting via an effective yukawa potential .",
    "more recently , netz @xcite investigated thoroughly and analytically the behavior of macroions near charged interfaces , based on the debye - hckel ( dh ) theory , but ignoring its finite size .",
    "thereby , the striking effect of surface charge amplification advocated here could not be captured by those approaches .",
    "@xcite it is only very recently , that this phenomenon was reported by lozada - cassou and coworkers .",
    "@xcite for a size - asymmetrical electrolyte , @xcite surface charge amplification was identified by solving numerically the modified gouy - chapman ( where cations and anions have different distances of closest approach to the interface ) .",
    "intimately related to our work , the phenomenon of surface charge amplification in presence of macroions was also found by applying a sophisticated hypernetted chain / mean spherical approximation ( hnc / msa ) integral equation .",
    "@xcite    in this work , we present a simple model , where the finite size of the macroions is taken into account , to reveal the mechanisms governing macroion adsorption .",
    "although our approach is less accurate than the one used by lozada - cassou and coworkers , @xcite it presents the nice advantage to be analytical and very intuitive .",
    "the basic driving force of surface charge amplification is that ( spherical ) macroions tend to be surrounded by its counterions over _ its whole surface in a uniform manner_. this corresponds actually to the old classical thomson s sphere problem .",
    "@xcite as long as the strength of the surface charge density of the oppositely charged substrate is low enough , a finite number of counterions of the macroions should stay in the vicinity of the interface ( see fig .",

    "our model corresponds somehow to the minimal correction for macroion size effect . having to deal with a _ finite _ concentration of macroions at contact with a reservoir , whose bulk value is given by @xmath5",

    "those anions will be referred to as the _ coions _ of the substrate .",
    "additional ( point - like ) monovalent counterions ( @xmath8 ) and coions are also considered with a bulk salt concentration @xmath9 . an intuitive and widely used way to connect self - consistently the electrostatic potential , @xmath10 , to the total charge density , @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 standing for the ionic species ) ,",
