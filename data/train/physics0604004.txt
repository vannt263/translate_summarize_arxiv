    "they manifest in areas ranging from financial markets to natural sciences .",
    "several techniques have been developed to study the correlations and scaling properties of time series exhibiting self - similar behavior ; some of these data sets are non - stationary in character . various methods like r",
    "/ s analysis @xcite , structure function method @xcite , wavelet transform modulus maxima @xcite , detrended fluctuation analysis and its variants @xcite , average wavelet coefficient method @xcite and a recently developed discrete wavelet based approach by the present authors , have been employed for the characterization of fluctuations @xcite .",
    "wavelets , through their multi - resolution and localization abilities , are well suited for extracting fluctuations at various scales from local trends over appropriate window sizes @xcite .",
    "the nature of the fluctuations extracted partly depend on the choice of the wavelets , which are designed to have properties useful for a desired analysis .",
    "for example , the daubechies family of wavelets satisfy vanishing moment conditions , which make them ideal to separate polynomial trends in a data set . in a number of wavelet based approach for characterizing self - similar data ,",
    "wavelet high - pass coefficients are used in finding the fluctuation function or other related quantities .",
    "for example , in the average wavelet coefficient method , continuous wavelet transform is used to find the variations through the corresponding wavelet coefficients , from which the hurst scaling exponent is computed .",
    "the goal of the present article is to analyze the self - similar properties of the fluctuations , as extracted through discrete wavelet coefficients , for the purpose of checking its efficacy vis - a - vis the continuous wavelet based method .",
    "the study is carried out on gaussian white noise and binomial multifractal model time series , as well as a number of physical data sets .",
    "it is found that the fluctuation function based on discrete wavelet coefficients is accurate in estimating hurst scaling exponent .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that continuous wavelets , because of their over completeness tend to overestimate the power . in comparison ,",
    "the discrete wavelets provide a complete orthonormal basis , ensuring that fluctuations are independent at each level .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    ", we study the nature of the fluctuations extracted through the wavelet coefficients . in sec.iii",
    ", we then proceed to the detailed analysis of fluctuations of gaussian white noise and binomial multi - fractal model and compare the discrete wavelet based result with average wavelet coefficient method .",
    "subsequently , we carry out analysis of the fluctuations in the data of observed ionization current and potentials in tokamak plasma , time series constructed from random matrix ensembles and the financial data sets belonging to nasdaq and bombay stock exchange ( bse ) composite indices . finally , we conclude after summarizing our findings and giving future directions of work .",
    "in discrete wavelet transform it is well - known that , a given signal belonging to @xmath0 space can be represented in a nested vector space spanned by the scaling functions alone .",
    "this basic requirement of multi - resolution analysis ( mra ) can be formally written as @xcite , @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this provides a successive approximation of a given signal in terms of low - pass or approximation coefficients .",
    "it is clear that , the space that contains high resolution signals will also contain signals of lower resolution .",
    "the signal or time series can be approximated at a level of ones choice , for use in finding the local trend over a desired window .",
    "the fluctuations can then be obtained by subtracting the above trend from the signal .",
    "we have followed this approach earlier for extracting the fluctuations , by elimination of local polynomial trends through the daubechies wavelets @xcite .",
    "wavelets also provide a decomposition of a signal in terms of wavelet coefficients and one low - pass coefficient :    @xmath4    and @xmath5    wavelet coefficients represent variations of the signal at different scales .",
    "for example , level one coefficients capture the highest frequency components , corresponding to variations at highest resolution and other wavelet coefficients represent variations at progressively higher scales or lower resolutions . as mentioned earlier",
    ", these coefficients can differ significantly from the true fluctuations in the data sets .",
    "below , we explore this aspect through the estimation of hurst exponents .",
    "next , we obtain the statistics of scale dependence by transforming the profile of the time series into wavelet space , the coefficients of wavelets at various scales @xmath11 are used to determine the fluctuation function .",
    "the high frequency details are captured by the lower scale wavelet coefficients and the higher scales capture the low frequency details . by convolving the discrete wavelet",
    "transform over the given time series , the wavelet coefficients are obtained for various scales :    @xmath12    here @xmath13 is the scaling index and @xmath14 represents the translation variable . since discrete wavelet transform satisfies orthogonality condition , it can provide the information of time series at various scales unambiguously .",
    "performing wavelet transform using daubechies basis , the polynomial trends in the time series are eliminated . in the analysis carried out below",
    "we make use of the daubechies-4 wavelets . as has been observed earlier , small fluctuations are least affected by this basis and straight line trends ( akin to a linear fit ) are removed through the use of this wavelet @xcite .",
    "the wavelet power is calculated by summing the squares of the coefficient values for each level :    @xmath15    to characterize the time series , the fluctuation function @xmath16 at a level @xmath11 is obtained from the cumulative power spectrum :    @xmath17^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    the scaling behavior is then obtained through ,    @xmath18    here @xmath19 is the hurst scaling exponent , which can be obtained from the slope of the log - log plot of @xmath16 vs scales @xmath11 .",
    "it is well known that hurst exponent is one of the fractal measures , which varies from @xmath20 . for persistent time series @xmath21 and @xmath22 uncorrelated series . @xmath23 for anti - persistent time series .     inside the main plasma and ( c ) ion saturation current ( isc ) , when the probe is in the limiter shadow .",
