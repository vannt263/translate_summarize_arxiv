    "the interface of a superconductor ( sc ) and a ferromagnetic metal ( fm ) is a source of many intriguing phenomena  @xcite . unlike the case of the proximity effect between a sc and a normal metal",
    ", there is oscillation of the decaying cooper pair density in the ferromagnetic region of the heterostructure .",
    "this oscillation occurs because of the slightly different fermi wave - vectors of the electrons of different spin in the fm . in the sc /",
    "fm proximity effect these oscillations occur for both the spin - singlet part of the pairing correlation , and also for the opposite spin ( @xmath4 relative to the fm magnetisation direction ) part of the spin - triplet pairing correlations .",
    "both of these parts of the pairing correlations are strongly suppressed by non - magnetic disorder in the fm and so lead to only a short ranged proximity effect in sc / fm heterostructures . if , however , the sc / fm interface allows for some kind of spin - flip process , then in addition to these singlet and opposite - spin triplet cooper pair correlations it is also possible that equal - spin spin - triplet pairing correlations ( @xmath5 ) can be generated at the interface .",
    "such pairing correlations are compatible with the ferromagnetic exchange interaction  @xcite and hence do not oscillate or decay in the fm region .",
    "these equal - spin spin - triplet pairing correlations thus allow for the long - range proximity effect , which is observed in certain sc / fm heterostructures .",

    "experimentally , several different approaches to provide a spin - flip process at the interface have been proposed and proven to generate long - ranged sc / fm proximity effects .",
    "here we specifically focus on the case where the necessary spin - flip scattering potential is provided by conical magnetic interface layers .",

    "these calculations confirm that the conical magnet acts as a suitable spin - flip potential and generates equal - spin spin - triplet pairing correlations which extend far into the fm region , providing the microscopic basis for the long ranged proximity effect in such heterostructures .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate in greater detail a single interface between an sc and a conical magnet ( cm ) .",
    "the conical magnetic structure of ho is characterised by the opening angle @xmath6 measuring the deviation of magnetisation from the @xmath1-axis growth direction ( assumed normal to the sc / fm interface ) and a turning ( or pitch ) angle @xmath7 describing the magnetisation rotation between adjacent ho layers .",
    "all previous theoretical investigations of sc / cm proximity effects focus on heterostructures containing ho , and so naturally the conical magnetic angles @xmath0 and @xmath2 have been kept fixed to their respective ho values . consequently",
    ", an overall picture of the effectiveness of equal - spin spin - triplet generation of ho compared to other possible conical magnetic interface materials has not emerged yet . here",
    "we present calculations showing the influence of conical magnetic interface layers with varying @xmath0 and @xmath2 on the efficiency of equal - spin spin - triplet generation .",
    "we examine sc / cm interfaces in which the conical magnet parameters @xmath0 and @xmath2 are varied in the ranges of @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",

    "a summary and outlook are provided in the conclusion .",
    "the results presented below utilise self - consistent solutions of the microscopic bdg equations in the clean limit .",
    "the method employed is similar to our previous work on ho containing heterostructures  @xcite , so only the most relevant formulas are repeated here .",
    "generally , the spin - dependent bdg equations can be written as  @xcite @xmath13 here , @xmath14 denotes the eigenvalues , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are quasiparticle and quasihole amplitudes for spin @xmath17 , respectively . after some simplifications  @xcite the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath18 reads @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 being electronic creation and destruction operators at multilayer index @xmath22 , respectively . choosing the next - nearest neighbour hopping parameter @xmath23 and the chemical potential ( fermi energy ) @xmath24 sets the energy scales .",

    "the pairing interaction is assumed to apply only for @xmath34-wave singlet cooper pairs , and so the pairing potential is restricted to a scalar quantity @xmath32 .",

    "the superconducting pairing correlation between spins @xmath0 and @xmath2 can generally be evaluated as on - site interaction for times @xmath41 and @xmath42 as @xmath43 with @xmath44 being the many - body field operator for spin @xmath17 at time @xmath45 .",
    "the time - dependence is introduced through the heisenberg equation of motion .",
    "being local in space the pairing correlation evaluated using leads to vanishing triplet contribution for @xmath46 in accordance with the pauli principle  @xcite .",

    "fm proximity effect this has a natural choice as the fm spin direction .",
    "however in the present calculations for a sc / cm interface there is no such fixed reference axis , since the rotation of the cm moment leads to a spatially varying local magnetisation direction .",
    "therefore it is helpful to represent the triplet pairing correlations in a form which is independent of the spin - quantisation axis chosen .",
    "recalling we define @xmath53 as the triplet pairing matrix for an ordinary spin - triplet superconductor @xmath54 which obeys the following identity  @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the identity matrix . for bulk triplet superconductors",

    "there is no pairing interaction in the triplet channel , , and so @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , instead of this we focus on the triplet pair correlation function matrix which can be written similarly to the matrix as  @xcite @xmath63 ( note the additional factor @xmath64 in this definition compared to  @xcite to be consistent with the definition of @xmath65 in . ) now the analogue to reads @xmath66 the two analogues to @xmath60 and @xmath67 , namely @xmath68 and @xmath69 , can be expressed conveniently in terms of the @xmath70-vector components , depending on the spin - dependent triplet pairing correlations as @xmath71 the coordinate axis independent quantity , @xmath72 , can be interpreted as the mean density of spin - triplet cooper pairs , and the quantity @xmath73 can be interpreted as a vector whose magnitude and direction denote the net spin moment arising from the non - unitary ( equal - spin ) part of the triplet cooper pair density .",
    "of course the quantities @xmath68 and @xmath74 are also gauge invariant under overall phase changes of the superconducting order parameter .",

    "the upper ( lower ) middle panels depict the real ( green ) and imaginary ( orange ) parts of @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) for the same system . according to ,",
    "these pairing correlations are the two contributions to @xmath82 .",
    "finally , the upper and lower right panels of depict the magnitude of the @xmath70-vector and the magnitude of @xmath88 as introduced in , respectively .    starting with @xmath81 and @xmath82 , shown in the left panels of , one notices only slight oscillations of the real parts around the interface layer , whereas the oscillations of the imaginary parts proceed well into the conical magnet layer .",
    "it has to be noted that the faster oscillations visible in the imaginary part are related to the chosen turning angle @xmath2 , i.e. , the layer index difference between adjacent maxima correspond to one full turn of the conical magnetic structure .",
    "this is superimposed on a slower oscillation responsible for some pronounced intensity decay in the imaginary parts of @xmath81 and @xmath82 as one goes further into the conical magnet side of the interface .",
    "looking now at the middle panels of , depicting the real and imaginary parts of @xmath83 and @xmath89 , one notices a different behaviour for real and imaginary parts .",

    "evaluating @xmath82 according to leads to the vanishing contributions away from the interface .",
    "the very fast oscillations shown in the real parts away from the interface are an artefact of the simple model used here and should vanish once the full @xmath90 dependence ( parallel to the interface layer ) and / or impurity scattering effects are taken into account , thereby allowing for deviations from the clean limit .",
    "the imaginary parts of @xmath91 and @xmath84 , however , are of equal size but opposite sign leading to the nonvanishing contributions to @xmath82 shown in the lower left panel of .",

    "finally the lower right panel in depicts the magnitude of @xmath69 , giving insight in the spin magnetic properties of the cooper pairs .",
    "it can be seen that the magnetic properties of the pairing decay very rapidly on both sides of the interface , with stronger intensities to be seen in the conical magnet side .",
    "the pairing spin magnetic moments are only visible for approximately one turn of the conical magnet , while the magnetic moments in the superconductor side of the interface describe the so - called inverse proximity effect .",

    "any @xmath2 clearly stem from the interface region , with a rapidly decaying oscillation in the conical magnet region .",
    "the influence of @xmath2 on the pairing correlation @xmath81 is largest for @xmath78 and @xmath94 , which is best seen from the upper left panel of .",
    "going away from those extremal @xmath2 values , the pairing correlation decays very quickly to approximately one third of its maximum value for @xmath95 .",
    "looking at the @xmath82 pairing correlations in the lower panels of the maxima are slightly shifted away from the extremal @xmath2 values but show again a decrease towards @xmath96 and fall again down to roughly one third of the maximum @xmath82 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath81 in the upper panels with maximal contributions from @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the respective @xmath2 contributions to @xmath82 vanish .",
    "the right panels show a top view of the data shown in the middle panels to depict the slight oscillations with changing @xmath2 .",
    "these patterns are similar for @xmath81 and @xmath82 .    keeping in mind that the data displayed in corresponds to @xmath11 , the middle and right panels allow an estimate of the turning angle s influence on the decay length of @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",

    "the maxima occur for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , as for @xmath81 , whereas the decaying patterns are similar to the ones already familiar from .",
    "additionally , the most prominent contributions to the triplet pairing correlations again originate from the interface region . only in the top view figure ( upper right panel ) can be seen a somewhat blurred superposition of the right panels of .",
    "this can be attributed to the slight out - of - phase relation of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , as already seen in and discussed in .",
    "however , the magnitude of @xmath69 describing the triplet spin magnetic properties behaves surprisingly differently . as seen in the lower panels of , it is zero for @xmath99 , then increases up to a first maximum around @xmath100 , and subsequently decreases again to form a small plateau around @xmath95 .",
    "after that the magnitude of @xmath69 has another sharp increase to its maximum value , before vanishing again for @xmath79 . the fact that this vanishes for @xmath78 and @xmath94 is to be expected since these are collinear magnetic structures ( ferro- or antiferromagnetic , respectively ) and so there are no spin - flip processes at the sc / cm interface .",
    "we now consider variations in the full range of both conical magnet angles @xmath0 and varying @xmath2 .",
    "as has been discussed in the most prominent contributions to either @xmath81 and @xmath82 or @xmath68 and @xmath101 originate from the interface region , as can be seen clearly from and .",
    "the height profile of the respective quantities for a fixed @xmath0 and varying @xmath2 are shown in the left panels of those figures , displaying the @xmath92 views .",
    "since the maxima of @xmath81 and @xmath82 are always occurring in the interface region this gives us the opportunity to have a look at the data for all angles @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",

    "with increasing @xmath0 the triplet pairing correlations @xmath81 and @xmath82 increase up to a maximum around @xmath104 to then decay to zero again afterwards . in the appearance along the @xmath2",
    "coordinate is similar for all @xmath0 values and has already been shown , as for example in .",

    "this can be understood knowing that vanishing contributions to @xmath82 are due to equal size but opposite sign contributions from @xmath83 and @xmath84 generating @xmath82 .",
    "looking additionally at the separate contributions @xmath83 and @xmath84 can provide a deeper understanding of spin - triplet generation at specific interfaces .",
    "coming back to the data at hand , maxima in the magnitude of the @xmath70-vector appear for @xmath104 and @xmath2 either @xmath8 or @xmath9 , i.e. , a complete ferromagnet or antiferromagnet with the magnetic moments oriented along the @xmath52-axis .",
    "all deviations from this ferromagnetic - like arrangement of magnetic moments between adjacent layers , either changing just @xmath2 ( corresponding to a helical magnet ) , or changing both @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( a cm ) leads to a decrease in the magnitude of the @xmath70-vector associated with the unitary triplet pairing correlations in the sc / cm interface .",
    "the right panel of now shows the magnitude of @xmath97 associated with the non - unitary triplet pairing , or spin magnetic moment of the cooper pair .",
    "the pattern of this quantity with respect to varying @xmath2 are the same as already discussed in and shown in , namely vanishing contributions for @xmath78 , increase up to @xmath100 , again decreasing to the plateau around @xmath96 , and then the sharp increase to the maximum value .",
    "the maximum values of the non - unitary pairing correlations clearly occur for values of @xmath0 near to @xmath107 and @xmath94 , although the correlation becomes zero exactly at the point @xmath108 , @xmath79 , since this is a antiferromagnetic structure .",
    "one can see in these plots that the cm angle values of @xmath109 and @xmath7 , corresponding to ho as used in the experiments , are fairly typical in their behaviour .",
    "in fact in there is a broad maximum in the non - unitary triplet pairing function @xmath69 for values similar to those of ho .",
