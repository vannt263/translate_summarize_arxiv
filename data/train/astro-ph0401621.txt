    "the prompt gamma - ray emission lasted @xmath0270  s , making it one of the longest bursts observed with the satellite . following the distribution of a 2  radius error circle @xcite , we identified @xcite the optical counterpart of the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) .",
    "an x - ray afterglow was subsequently detected @xcite and its redshift measured via absorption lines in the optical spectrum to be @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "we observe significant deviations from the power - law decline ( @xmath41 ) in the x - ray flux ( @xmath363@xmath42 as derived from spearman s rank correlation ) .",
    "although the x - ray fluctuations are not as significant as the optical ones , the value of the ( x - ray ) spearman rank correlation coefficient translates to a probability of less than @xmath43 that this correlation is a statistical fluctuation .",

    "the fluctuation time - scale is comparable to that observed in the optical , with @xmath46 . from the short overlap of the optical and x - ray data ,",
    "we find that the oscillations are not in phase with a time difference of at least @xmath47 hours ( as derived from the cross correlation function ) .",
    "the short - term wave - like behaviour of the grb 011211 optical light curve reported here is unprecedented .",
    "this behaviour was not detected in the earlier analysis of the oa of grb  011211 reported by @xcite , due to insufficient data sampling .",
    "moreover , the variations detected in the optical afterglow of grb  021004 @xcite appeared highly random and erratic , and all other grbs have displayed variations with much longer time - scales .",
    "we discuss below the origin of the bumps in the optical light curve of grb  011211 .    the simplest afterglow model , where a relativistic jet decelerates as it expands into the ambient matter leading to a radiative output with a characteristic power - law decay , has been remarkably successful so far in accommodating the present data @xcite . how does this model account for the unusual optical light curve of grb 011211 ?",
    "the strong temporal variations in the early afterglow could be interpreted as a result of _ i ) _ refreshed shocks created as the leading edge of the jet decelerates and is caught up by slower - moving jet gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , _ ii ) _ the relativistic jet impacting an external medium of variable density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "iii ) _ a non - uniform jet structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that a smooth jet traveling through a clumpy medium would quickly cease to be homogeneous , i.e. it is possible that _ ii ) _ could give rise to _ iii)_. refreshed shocks covering a large fraction of the emitting surface can only increase the energy of the blast wave , and therefore can not account for the rapid decay seen in the optical data ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ dos.fig ] ) .",
    "the sharpness of the features observed at optical frequencies is difficult to reconcile with a density discontinuity covering most of the visible surface of the jet @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the short time - scale of the oscillations provides interesting upper limits of @xmath0110  au on the size of the clumps around the source .",
    "these limits are lower than the fluctuation amplitudes seen on similar scales in the local interstellar medium @xcite , though they may reflect the length scale of comet - like clumps observed in ring nebulae surrounding massive stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a promising alternative interpretation is energy variations within the expanding jet .",
    "it is possible for a large fraction of the emitting surface of the jet to become active and the flare region to remain small , because the energy content of the jet varies strongly as a function of angle . at the time @xmath34 of the observations the region contributing to the total observed",
    "flux would have a transverse size of @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the lorentz factor of the jet . only regions the size of @xmath50 can produce afterglow fluctuations with time structures of @xmath51 .",
    "in other words , the jet - emitting surface is peppered with many regions ( hot spots ) on a scale much smaller than the narrow cone visible along the line of motion ( see fig .",
    "[ tres.fig ] ) .",
    "variations in the initial conditions as a function of the opening angle could spread the causally disconnected regions out along the line of sight to the observer such that the emission would arrive at different times . the corresponding overall emission at a given wavelength",
    "is then averaged over the observed region , and it may increase or decrease locally depending on the number , intensity , and spectrum of the different flare sites across the jet surface .",
    "this can happen either because the radiating material is in narrow fingers or , as the jet slows down , we observe afterglow emission not just from material moving directly towards us , but also from a wider range of angles .",
    "thus , an inhomogeneous energy jet is a viable explanation for the observed rapid variations in the light curve , with the size of a hot spot determining the duration of the bump .",
    ". the afterglow profile would be the sum of many emitting regions , and thus , should be smooth . _",
    "( b ) _ only regions the size of @xmath52 can produce afterglow fluctuations with a time structure of @xmath53 .",
    "the same jet pattern observed face - on is shown in _ ( c)_. the photon flux emitted per unit solid angle and per unit time at this flare site should be larger than that arising from the rest of the blast wave .",
    "the corresponding emission would then average over the observed region and it may increase ( or decrease ) depending on the intrinsic properties of different flare sites across the jet surface .",
    "for example , a single region with a @xmath49 that is ten times larger than for other regions could produce emission that doubles the overall count rate in a different energy band.__,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    from our optical observations alone we can safely conclude that the wiggles in the light curve of grb  011211 are the result of _ spherically asymmetric density or energy variations _",
    ", i.e. variations that cover less than the observed @xmath54 region .",
    "the question remains : can we decide between the above two scenarios . in principle",
    ", simultaneous multi - wavelength observations can help settle this question ( see salmonson & ramirez - ruiz , in preparation , for a detailed treatment ) and , although the x - ray variations are of lower significance than the optical , in what follows we explore the implications of fluctuations in both bands . as shown by j03 ,",
    "the x - ray band is located above the cooling frequency at the time of our observations , where density variations of the ambient medium have a much weaker impact on the emitted flux ( see e.g. equation  7 in * ? ? ?",
    "given the observed @xmath011@xmath45 variation in the x - ray flux , we would then expect a much stronger _ correlated _ optical one , which we do not observe . on the other hand ,",
    "uncorrelated fluctuations at different energy bands can be produced by hot spots ( small regions with higher energy and/or @xmath49 ) .",
    "since @xmath49 strongly affects the synchrotron peak frequency , a situation can easily arise where we observe a hot spot releasing most of its energy in the x - rays , without a significant optical contribution above the continuum .",
    "conversely , an optical / infrared bump can be detected without an x - ray counterpart , at least when the cooling frequency of the afterglow continuum spectrum is located between the optical and the x rays .",
    "thus , the combined departure from a power - law decay observed in the optical and x - ray light curves seems to disfavour a scenario in which the density of the ambient medium varies and the energy is kept constant across the jet surface .",
    "the above reasoning assumes that the x - ray and optical photons are emitted from the surface of the expanding jet , an assumption justified by the fact that the variations seen at different energies have similar time - scales .",
    "interestingly , the analysis of the x - ray spectrum during this time frame uncovered the presence of emission line features arising from metal - enriched material @xcite .",
    "it is feasible that a fraction of x - ray photons reach the observer after being reflected by material away from the line of sight @xcite . while the presence of such spectral features is not conclusive ( but see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the x - ray wiggles observed here could be attributed to variations in the line emission intensity , which in turn are caused by changes in the illuminating continuum .",
    "the x - ray afterglow could then , at least in part , be due to the continuing power output from the grb central engine interacting with the envelope of a massive progenitor star @xcite .",
    "collapsar @xcite or magnetar - like @xcite models not only provide a natural scenario for a sudden burst followed by a decaying energy output but could also easily imprint a non - uniform structure to the grb jet as it bores its way through the stellar mantle @xcite . further data on early x - ray spectral and temporal features provided by the swift satellite will offer additional clues to the nature of the progenitor and the relativistic jet that it triggers .",
