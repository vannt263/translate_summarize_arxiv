    "the milky way presents a region at approximately 5 kpc from the sun that dominates its star - forming structure .",
    "this region is called the galactic ring and it is an enormous reservoir of material for the formation of new stars and stellar clusters .",
    "most of the galactic giant h  ii regions , far - infrared ( far - ir ) luminosity , diffuse ionized gas , and supernovae remnants are associated with the ring according to @xcite .",
    "the galactic ring remains largely unexplored .",
    "@xcite have conducted a molecular line survey of the inner galaxy called the boston university - five college radio astronomy observatory galactic ring survey ( grs ) .",
    "this survey uses the molecular transition @xmath0co  @xmath1 which peers more deeply into the interiors of molecular clouds than the more common @xmath2co .",
    "this data set has provided the tools to discover infrared dark clouds which represent the densest clumps within giant molecular clouds where massive stars may eventually form .",
    "we are using this information to select several regions that present high intensity in the molecular transition in order to perform a detailed mid- and near - ir follow - up research .",
    "we are interested in performing a thorough description of the stellar populations in those regions , with emphasis on the massive stellar components .",
    "massive stars are born in giant molecular clouds and form most likely in stellar clusters @xcite .",
    "they physically and chemically interact with their environment by the ionization due to ultraviolet ( uv ) light , by stellar winds , and by supernova explosions .",
    "massive stars spend their youth embedded in the molecular cloud in which they form ; therefore , young massive stars must be studied at infrared or longer wavelengths .",
    "it has been found that massive young clusters @xmath3 and age @xmath4 myr ) usually trigger a second - generation of star formation , and frequently the most luminous second - generation sources are located inside the heads of dust pillars oriented towards the central cluster .",
    "giant dust pillars are often found at the edges of h  ii regions .",
    "the dust pillars in m16 ( the eagle nebula , @xcite ) are a well known example .",

    "dust pillars have also been found in starburst regions in the magellanic clouds ( 30 doradus and n11 ) .    in this letter , we present the discovery of two dust pillars located close to the conspicuous molecular cloud grsmc45.453 + 0.060 ( using the notation of @xcite to name the galactic ring survey molecular clouds . )",

    "we have used the grs to identify interesting regions where we would perform mid- and near - ir studies , with particular interest in the massive star populations .",
    "the 5 kpc ring dominates both the molecular interstellar medium and the star - formation activity in the milky way .",
    "therefore , it plays a crucial role in the dynamics , structure , and evolution of our galaxy .",
    "we retrieved the fits cubes in the range @xmath8 , @xmath9 from their survey and we built a colour contour plot shown in figure  1 .",

    "the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) @xcite has uniformly scanned the entire sky in three near - infrared bands to detect and characterize point sources brighter than about 1  mjy in each band , with signal - to - noise ratio greater than 10 , using a pixel size of @xmath21 this project used two 1.3m telescopes ( one in each hemisphere ) equipped with a three - channel camera , each channel consisting of a 256 @xmath22 256 pixels@xmath7 array of hgcdte detectors , capable of observing the sky simultaneously in bands @xmath23 ( 1.25  @xmath14 m ) , @xmath24 ( 1.65  @xmath14 m ) , and @xmath25 ( 2.17  @xmath14 m ) .",
    "we retrieved @xmath26 , and @xmath25 archival 2mass images that cover a 30 arcminute region around @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "we also downloaded the catalogue of stars from the point source catalog ( psc ) that contains a total of 79528 objects found in the same region .",
    "the individual fits frames from glimpse were mosaicked using montage and our own idl codes to produce a three - colour image of the entire field around grsmc45.453 + 0.060 .",
    "we combined the images obtained in filters [ 3.6 ] , [ 5.8 ] , and [ 8.0 ] by assigning blue to the shortest wavelength band , green to the intermediate band , and red to the longest wavelength band .",

    "figure  1 [ bottom ] shows the three - colour mosaic where we have labeled four spectacular molecular clouds : grsmc45.073 + 0.129 , grsmc45.122 + 0.132 , grsmc45.453 + 0.060 , and grsmc45.478 + 0.131 .",
    "each of them is associated with an _ infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) _ point source and with thermal radio continuum emission which is indicative of h  ii regions @xcite . a comparison with the grs @xmath0co @xmath27 map shows that all four molecular cores present bright @xmath0co emission as well as extended mid - ir emission .",
    "note the bridge of @xmath0co emission connecting the two groups of molecular clouds .",
    "a closer inspection of the structure close to grsmc45.453 + 0.060 reveals the existence of two striking dust pillars .",
    "figure  2 shows a magnified version of this region in the galaxy .",
    "the irac bands show bright , diffuse , and very highly structured emission , which is produced primarily by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features and br@xmath28 line emission @xcite .",
    "the reddish shades in figure 2 indicate the distribution of warm dust emitting primarily in the 6.2@xmath14 m pah feature in the [ 5.8 ] band and the 7.7 and 8.6@xmath14 m pah features in the [ 8.0 ] band .",
    "main - sequence stars with photospheres hotter than 1000  k appear blue in irac colors , except for the most reddened ones , and are brightest at [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] @xcite .",
    "we observe that the diffuse emission systematically and sharply increases from [ 3.6 ] to [ 8.0 ] and that it is extremely faint or inexistent in the 2mass @xmath26 , and @xmath25 images .",
    "our three - colour mosaic , built using mid - ir glimpse images in irac [ 3.6 ] , [ 5.8 ] , and [ 8.0 ] bands shows the existence of a couple of dust pillars located to the northeast of grsmc45.453 + 0.060 . using the approximate galactic coordinates of their heads , we name them dp45.542 - 0.006 and dp45.543 - 0.029 . table  1",
    "provides their galactic coordinates .",
    "we may argue that these pillars appear to be aligned with the ionizing region grsmc 45.478 + 0.131 .",
    "we can also speculate that dp45.543 - 0.029 is located in front of dp45.542 - 0.006 , and is more heavily obscured .",
    "the northern rim of dp45.542 - 0.006 is very well defined and we can trace the silhouette of dp45.543 - 0.029 on the structure of dp45.542 - 0.006 .",
    "these protrusions obviously began as pre - existing density enhancements in the original surrounding molecular cloud , and they evolved into the forms seen under the combined effect of photoionization and flows coming from the nearby h  ii regions .",
    "these pillars are the result of the interaction of massive stars with their environment , and they are most likely places of star formation .    for our research",
    "we assume a distance to the molecular cloud grsmc45.453 + 0.060 of 6.0 kpc .",
    "this distance was determined kinematically by @xcite .",
    "a simple measurement of the length and width of the pillars is given in table  1 .",
    "the definition of these measurements is of course subjective because the base of the pillars merges into larger dust structures .",
    "we want to emphasize that we measure projected quantities , since the inclination angles are unknown .",
    "our estimated values are in agreement with those that @xcite calculated for other dust pillars in the galaxy .",
    "the heads of the two pillars that we discovered are dramatically different as seen from our point of view .",
    "both of them show the presence of young stellar objects , but while the stars in the head of dp45.543 - 0.029 appear to remain enclosed in the dusty cocoon , those of dp45.542 - 0.006 have already started to disrupt the interstellar medium .",
    "this is a perfect indicator of ongoing stellar evolution , and it may suggest that the stars in the latter pillar are older . however , it is possible that due to the geometry of the region , the dust may be concealing the disruption of the ism produced by the new born stars in dp45.543 - 0.029 . from the 2mass point source catalogue of this region , and at a resolution of @xmath29 per pixel",
    "we find three objects at the tip of dp45.542 - 0.006 , and two in dp45.543 - 0.029 .",
    "we may speculate that the stars in these pillars represent a second generation of star formation in this region .",
    "studies of bright - rimmed clouds containing infrared sources have been taken as evidence of star formation induced by radiatively driven implosion @xcite .",
    "triggered second - generation star formation in the vicinity of o - type stars and clusters is ubiquitous , and often the second generation is associated with dust pillars .",
    "these processes may play an important role in the self propagation of star formation in the galaxy .",
    "recent galactic surveys in radio and the infrared are providing us with exciting new tools to study nearby star formation and the interaction of massive stars with their environment . in this research we have used the galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ( glimpse ) conducted using the _ spitzer space telescope _ and the galactic ring survey ( grs ) performed at the five college radio astronomy observatory .",
    "grs has the ability to identify and probe active star - forming gas , and glimpse delineates the structure of molecular clouds and their dust composition .",
    "we discovered two remarkable dust pillars near the molecular cloud grsmc45.453 + 0.060 .",
    "even though they seem close to each other ( in projection ) , one of them shows a more evolved structure that the other , from our point of view .",
    "we intend to continue our research of this whole star forming region of the galaxy .",
    "we will perform near infrared studies to gather information on their stellar populations by means of photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "a future paper will investigate the truth of the speculations proposed in this letter in more detail , but new spectroscopic and photometric observations of this region are strongly encouraged in order to characterize the nature of these clouds and the stellar population associated with them .",
    "the space - mass - age distributions of the objects in these regions will tell us a great deal about the relationships between higher- and lower - mass star formation .",
    "in particular we are interested in the distribution of stellar ages in order to corroborate our hypothesis of the two - stage star formation process .",
    "the early results of our research indicate the importance of large field - of - view ir observations like the ones provided by the glimpse survey .",
    "we are confident that our detailed studies of star forming regions near the galactic plane will play a crucial role in the overall understanding of the milky way .",
