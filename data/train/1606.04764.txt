    "multipolar anions form a unique class of molecular open quantum systems @xcite , whose properties arise from the competition between the short - ranged electrostatic multipolar potential , nonadiabatic coupling of electronic motion to molecular rotation , and a strong coupling to the one - electron continuum .",
    "they thus represent prototypical extreme halos @xcite , and laboratories for similar systems , such as deformed halo nuclei that are governed by short - ranged potentials , non - adiabatic rotation , and a strong coupling to the one- or two - nucleon continuum .",
    "moreover , general studies of resonances reveal a plethora of phenomena present in open quantum systems , such as exceptional points @xcite , superradiance @xcite , near - threshold clustering @xcite , and resonance trapping @xcite .",
    "consequently , unique characteristics of multipolar molecules in the landscape of open quantum systems call for detailed studies of their resonant spectra",
    ".    the striking case of dipolar anions has been extensively studied @xcite , using effective potentials methods @xcite as well as ab initio approaches @xcite . in this case , the attractive potential @xmath0 is singular and thus can support an infinite number of bound states @xcite for a dipole moment that is greater than a certain critical value .",
    "this raised a question whether dipole - bound anions could be a realization of a quantum anomaly @xcite .",
    "however , when considering the rotational motion of the system , the answer to this question is negative @xcite .",
    "the value of the critical moment @xmath1 required to bind an extra electron has been first determined @xcite by fermi and teller @xcite for a point - dipole ( @xmath2 ) and then generalized to an extended dipole with an infinite moment of inertia @xcite . however , high resolution electron photodetachment experiments @xcite suggested a greater critical moment , which appeared to be consistent with nonadiabatic calculations ( @xmath3 ) including the rotational degrees of freedom of the anion @xcite . in this case ,",
    "dipolar anions support only few bound states and the value of @xmath1 depends on the moment of inertia .",
    "moreover , rotational states in dipolar anions were expected to be strongly affected by the shallowness of the molecular potential and the nonadiabatic coupling of the electronic and molecular rotational motions @xcite .",
    "the strong coupling of the attached electron to the continuum @xcite renders the picture even more complex , with the existence of low - energy sharp resonances @xcite in various systems , and the modification of the wigner s law @xcite for the dipolar field @xcite , first observed in hydrogen atoms @xcite and then extended to different power - law potentials @xcite .    in a previous study , using a pseudopotential method and the berggren expansion technique @xcite , we showed that in hydrogen cyanide anions @xmath4 the competition between continuum effects and rotations leads to a transition from the subthreshold strong - coupling regime , where the external electron is in a spatially extended bound halo state that follows the rotational motion of the molecule , to the weak - coupling regime , where the electron and molecular motions are largely decoupled .",
    "the quadrupolar anions case seems more straightforward .",
    "the potential @xmath5 is singular for any attractive value of the quadrupole moment and its asymptotic solutions are known analytically for a finite moment of inertia of the molecule .",
    "however , it has been an experimental challenge to find systems where the excess electron is bound only due to the electric quadrupole moment @xcite .",
    "while the attachment of an electron by a pure quadrupolar field has been proposed theoretically already in 1979 @xcite for beryllium oxide anions ( beo)@xmath6 , the first experimental evidence of a quadrupole - bound anion has been obtained only in 2004 @xcite , for the trans - succinonitrile ( @xmath7 ) molecule , whose gauche conformer is actually dipole - bound .",
    "even octupole - bound anions have been reported experimentally @xcite as early as in 2000 .",
    "recently , state - of - the - art ab initio calculations on several quadrupole - bound anion candidates @xcite concluded that the quadrupole binding is much weaker than dipole binding as the electron - molecule potential is not dominated by one component .",
    "one of the reason is that the attractive @xmath5 potential can attach an electron in very localized states @xcite , near the neutral polar molecule .",
    "it is thus difficult if not impossible in realistic conditions , to disentangle whether the electron s binding energy comes solely from the long - range quadrupolar field @xcite . as a case in point ,",
    "the ( beo)@xmath6 anion has a rhombic neutral form with a zero dipole - moment and a large quadrupole moment , and is quadrupole - bound in its ground state ( g.s . ) according to ab initio calculations @xcite , but a critical quadrupole moment can not be defined as for dipolar anions .    a controversial example remains the carbon disulfide cs@xmath6 quadrupole - bound candidate . on the one hand , it can be argued that its quadrupole moment , @xmath82.67466@xmath9 , is insufficient to attach an electron @xcite , but , on the other hand , it has a simple linear geometry in its neutral form , and ab initio calculations @xcite have shown that cs@xmath6 can exist in an excited linear configuration that is stable towards autodetachment by about 0.0012ry , an energy compatible with binding energies in polar anions .",
    "experimentally , the situation is also difficult to interpret @xcite . indeed",
    ", rydberg electron transfer data @xcite show a characteristic sharp peak in the rydberg effective principal number @xmath10@xmath1117 dependence for the formation of cs@xmath6 that undergo electric - field - induced detachment .",
    "this is usually understood as a signature of dipole- or quadrupole - bound states @xcite .",
    "while cs@xmath6 has a positive electron affinity of @xmath120.05ry @xcite , it does not easily attach a free electron directly to form a long - lived anion due to rapid autodetachment @xcite , and a stabilization process is required for its formation @xcite .",
    "moreover , the g.s . of cs@xmath6",
    "is bent @xcite with an angle of about @xmath13 .",
    "the predicted linear excited state of cs@xmath6 thus appears as a  doorway state \" to the g.s .",
    "@xcite . this",
    "is also suggested by the fact that the @xmath14 energy is close to the bending vibrational energy of the cs@xmath6 g.s .",
    "@xcite . whether the linear excited state of cs@xmath6 is a pure quadrupole - bound state or not , can not be answered using simple models . however , simple models allow to shed light on particular aspects of problems , such as , for example , the role of the rotational motion in the critical binding of an electron on an electric dipole .",
    "we propose to investigate general properties of linear quadrupole - bound and unbound anions , using an electron - plus - molecule model and by taking into account the particle continuum . in this picture , the linear core is represented as a triad of point charges @xcite separated by a distance @xmath15 , with two possible configurations : oblate @xmath16 and prolate @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "considering the cylindrical symmetry along the molecule axis ( @xmath19-axis ) , and according to the buckinkham convention @xcite , the quadrupole moment is given by @xmath20 , where the sign of @xmath21 is given by the sign of the extremal charges in the triads .",
    "for this simple geometry of the system and in the adiabatic limit , i.e. , for an infinite moment of inertia of the neutral molecule , it is possible to calculate very precisely the positive and negative critical electric quadrupole moments of the core required to attach an excess electron @xcite in a @xmath22 state . in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the finite - scaling method @xcite recently introduced in atomic physics @xcite , the critical quadrupole moments have been expressed as a function of the scaled parameter @xmath23 , so that @xmath24 .",
    "the critical values for the scaled parameter have been found to be : @xmath25 and @xmath26 , for prolate and oblate critical quadrupole moments , respectively , and are consistent with numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "the quality of these estimates comes from the analyticity of the scaling property of the critical quadrupole moments .",
    "for that reason , we shall refer to these results as analytical in the following , even if they were arrived at numerically .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model hamiltonian is presented in sec .",
    "[ model_and_methods ] , as well as the coupled channel formulation of the schrdinger equation and the methods used to solve it .",
    "the results are discussed in sec .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "we benchmark our numerical calculations by comparing them to the analytical values of the critical electric quadrupole moments .",
    "thereafter follows the general discussion of quadrupolar anions as extreme halo systems , and we analyze the properties of the g.s .",
    "band in the continuum . finally , we discuss resonant spectra , with an emphasis on quasi - degenerate states .",
    "we also study the evolution of resonant states with the electric quadrupole moment .",
    "the conclusion and outlook are contained in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the schematic description of quadrupolar anions , in terms of a neutral molecular core plus an attached electron , is partially justified by the scale separation between binding energies of valence electron of the neutral molecule , and the energy attachment of the extra electron .",
    "however , microscopic studies have shown that for the quadrupolar potential the attached electron in the g.s .",
    "configuration is still rather close to the  core \" . in this study , however , we are interested in the low - energy states of quadrupolar anions , and in particular their resonances . for these very extended states",
    "the scale separation argument applies well @xcite .",
    "the rotational degrees of freedom of the molecular core are included within the particle - plus - rotor model @xcite in a non - adiabatic manner as described in refs .",
    "moreover , since the attached electron is assumed to be rather far from the core , the spin - orbit interaction is neglected . in this picture , the model hamiltonian can be written as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the linear momentum of the attached electron , @xmath29  its mass , and @xmath30 is the moment of inertia of the molecule .",
    "the total angular momentum is thus @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being the orbital angular momentum of the electron , and @xmath33 the molecular angular momentum .",
    "the pseudopotential @xmath34 that describes the interaction between the core and the electron @xcite is expressed through a multipole expansion : @xmath35 where the radial part @xmath36 is the electrostatic potential of a the linear charge distribution @xmath37 : @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the schrdinger equation can be conveniently expressed in the coupled - channel ( cc ) formalism , where the total wave function for a given total angular momentum @xmath41 can be written as : @xmath42 where the index @xmath43 labels the channels @xmath44 , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the radial and angular channel wave functions , respectively .",
    "since the hamiltonian is rotationally invariant , the wave function is independent of the total angular momentum projection @xmath47 .",
    "the cc equations are obtained by inserting the ansatz in the schrdinger equation : @xmath48 { u}_{c}^ { { j}^ { \\pi } } ( r ) \\nonumber \\\\          & = \\sum _ { c ' } { v } _ { c c ' } ^ { { j}^ { \\pi } } ( r ) { u } _ { c ' } ^ { { j}^ { \\pi } } ( r )          \\label{eq_cc_eqs }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the channel - channel coupling potential @xcite .      to solve the cc equations , we apply two methods .",
    "the first is the conventional direct integration method ( dim ) , described in ref .",
    "in dim , one integrates the cc equations from a given starting energy .",
    "this method gives very precise results when considering a limited number of channels , and bound states or fairly narrow resonances .",
    "the second method is the berggren expansion method ( bem ) , described in refs .",
    "@xcite , which may give results slightly less precise than the dim , if the latter applies , but much better results for a large number of channels and for broad resonances .",
    "moreover , since this technique is based on a diagonalization approach , it does not require any starting energy to converge and yields the full spectrum .    in the bem ,",
    "each channel wave function in eq .   is expanded in a single particle ( s.p . )",
    "basis , the so - called berggren basis @xcite , originally developed for configuration - interaction calculations in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "the berggren basis is a generalization of the newton basis @xcite in the complex plane ; it explicitly contains bound states , decaying resonances , and scattering continuum .",
    "the construction of the berggren basis for each partial wave @xmath50 is done as follows . in the first step , the discrete resonant ( gamow ) solutions @xmath51 of a given spherical one - body generating potential",
    "are calculated assuming the outgoing boundary conditions . in the next step ,",
    "the bound states ( @xmath52 imaginary ) and decaying resonances ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) that are relevant for the description of a physical system are selected and surrounded by a contour @xmath55 of complex - energy scattering states @xmath56 to ensure the completeness .",
    "the completeness relation for the resulting berggren basis corresponding to a channel @xmath50 is : @xmath57 where the contour @xmath55 starts at zero , surrounds the selected resonances and extends to @xmath58 .",
    "the tilde symbols indicate time - reversal .",
    "one may notice that there is some freedom when it comes to the choice of the berggen basis : the form of the generating potential ; the selection of the discrete resonant states entering the completeness relation ; and the form of the contour @xmath55 .    in the present study , the berggren basis for each partial wave",
    "is generated using the diagonal elements @xmath59 of the channel - channel coupling potential ; such a choice improves the convergence of calculations . because of the cauchy s integral theorem , the precise form of the contour @xmath55 is unimportant , provided that all the selected discrete states lie between the contour and the real axis in the momentum plane .",
    "the normalization of bound states is standard , while for decaying resonant states this is accomplished by means of the exterior complex scaling @xcite .",
    "the scattering states are normalized to the dirac delta . in practical applications ,",
    "the integral along the contour @xmath55 in eq .   is discretized using the gauss - legendre quadrature , and the selected scattering states are renormalized by the quadrature weights .",
    "the normalization of discretized scattering states reduces in practice to the kronecker delta normalization . in the calculations presented in this study",
    ", the shape of the contour has been defined through three segments : the first segment connecting the origin and the point @xmath60 with @xmath61 ; the second segment connecting points @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( real ) ; and the third segment lying on the real axis between @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the momentum cutoff @xmath64 has to be sufficiently large to ensure the completeness of the berggren basis .",
    "since the berggren basis explicitly contains bound states , resonances and scattering states , it is ideally suited for the description of very diffuse systems , such as halos or rydberg states , and also for unstable resonant states . while the dim is of limited applicability when the initial energy required to ensure the convergence has to be chosen very close to the exact value , the bem may also suffer from a related problem .",
    "indeed , the discrete states entering the berggren basis are obtained by integrating the schrdinger equation with @xmath65 , which is a process that requires a choice of starting energy . in many situations , harmonic oscillator expansion of the potential",
    "provides a starting point that is good enough to ensure the converge of the integration method , but for very weakly bound states or long - range potentials , this may fail . for that reason , a different approach , less sensitive to the initial conditions , has been proposed .",
    "the idea is to use the fact that the quality of the integration method with respect to the starting energy , is deteriorating faster than convergence speed of the eigenvalue @xmath66 .",
    "thus , for a potential @xmath67 that has a bound state with @xmath68 when @xmath69 , it is always possible to find a starting energy @xmath70 so that the integration @xmath71 will always converge for a sufficiently large value of @xmath72 .",
    "once such a point has been found , it is possible to make the integration to converge to the physical eigenenergy @xmath66 at the physical value of @xmath73 that defines the actual potential .",
    "indeed , the initial eigenenergy @xmath74 can be used as a starting energy to obtain @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "the same operation can be repeated using @xmath77 as a starting energy to get @xmath78 , with @xmath79 .",
    "after @xmath80 iterations , one gets : @xmath81 in order to minimize the number of iterations , the partition of @xmath82 can be chosen to exploit the sensitivity of the direct integration with respect to the starting energy , which is increasing as @xmath83 .",
    "thus the steps @xmath84 must be decreasing as @xmath83 , to both ( i ) preserve the stability of the integration at each step and ( ii ) minimizing the number of steps by considering bigger steps for larger values of @xmath85 .    to perform",
    "the partition of @xmath82 , any series @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and which preserves the stability of the integration , would suffice .",
    "if by @xmath89 one denotes the sum of @xmath86 , then the steps are defined by : @xmath90 in our case , @xmath91 has provided a good compromise .",
    "such an improved iterative procedure for bound states turned out to be helpful for evaluating the critical value of the parameter @xmath92 of the quadrupolar potential , as in this case extraordinary accuracy and stability are required .      in the berggren basis , the hamiltonian matrix becomes complex symmetric even if the hamiltonian itself is hermitian .",
    "this has a direct practical consequence , since the diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix gives a set of eigenstates that contain the resonant spectrum ( bound states and resonances ) embedded in the discretized complex - energy scattering continuum . because we are interested in resonant states , an identification procedure has to be used to identify them",
    ".    in the absence of poles in the berggren basis ,",
    "the overlap method @xcite usually applied in nuclear physics , based on the assumption that continuum states play a perturbative role , can not be applied . in this case , one may rely on another property of physical solutions . indeed , resonant states given by the diagonalization in the full space are a priori independent of the precise form of the contour @xmath55 . the contour - independence of resonant solutions has been used to identify dipolar anion resonances in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present study",
    ", we also utilize this technique . to this end , we take two contours @xmath93 and @xmath94 , which differ by the imaginary part of @xmath62 and are discretized using the same number of points . while scattering solutions obtained with these contours are shifted along the imaginary axis , the resonant states are fairly insensitive as the precise shape of the contour does not impact decaying solutions . for the identification of very weakly bound states and low - lying resonances , that are only given as a superposition of complex - energy scattering states in the bem ,",
    "the method based on the concept of contour independence has been essential .",
    "in order to benchmark the dim and bem as applied to quadrupolar anions , our adiabatic - limit results are compared with the analytical results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the critical electric quadrupole moment @xmath95 .",
    "the internuclear distance @xmath96 is fixed at @xmath97 as in ref .",
    "@xcite ; this value is close to the internuclear distance in @xmath98 ( @xmath99 @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding critical quadrupole moments are thus @xmath100 and @xmath101 .    in the dim ,",
    "the parameter that controls the accuracy of calculations is the orbital angular momentum cutoff @xmath102 that determines the size of the channel basis . for @xmath103 ,",
    "the dim gives a critical oblate quadrupole moment of @xmath104 . in the bem , in addition to @xmath102 ,",
    "the momentum cutoff @xmath105 needs to be be fixed . by taking a real contour discretized with 80 points , and @xmath106 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath107 .",
    "the critical oblate quadrupole moment can be approached closely with both methods , because it corresponds to a configuration of the attached electron that is well localized around the two positive charges at the center of the molecule .",
    "thus , the electron is expected to be primarily in low-@xmath108 orbits . for the prolate quadrupole moment , the situation is different . here , the attached electron , attracted by the extremal positive charges , is less bound and higher-@xmath108 partial waves are expected to play a more important role . indeed , as shown on fig .",

    "we obtained @xmath110 and @xmath111 with the dim and bem , respectively .",
    "while the convergence of @xmath112 with @xmath102 ( and @xmath105 ) is slower than for @xmath113 , dim and bem results are fairly consistent for @xmath109 and @xmath106 , and our results are in agreement with the dim result of ref .",

    "thus , while the oblate configuration results are useful for benchmarking purpose , their physical interpretation should be dealt with caution .      in quantum systems , the wave function may extend into the classically forbidden region to form the halo structure @xcite when the energy of a bound state approaches the threshold .",

    "[ fig_5 ] and [ fig_6 ] , is characterized by one dominant channel @xmath44 that represent about 99% of the total wave function , except for those indicated by empty symbols . within each family ,",
    "narrow resonances have a very diffuse dominant - channel wave function with a small number of nodes , while broader resonances tend to have wave functions peaked closer to the origin and having larger numbers of nodes .",
    "overall , energies of resonances tend to cluster close to the rotational states of the core , except for higher excitations where significant deviations can be seen .",
    "indeed , higher - lying resonances have larger values of the orbital angular momentum @xmath108 in their dominant channel , which results in larger centrifugal barriers .",
    "the similarity of resonant structures predicted for oblate and prolate configurations at different @xmath41 states can be explained in terms of the large delocalization of wave functions over thousands of @xmath180 .",
    "indeed , above the particle emission threshold , even high-@xmath121 states have the first peak of their wave function at few hundreds of @xmath180 .",
    "these resonances are consequently weakly sensitive to short - range details of the potential , and are mainly influenced by the asymptotic tail @xmath152 of the quadrupolar field .",
    "moreover , rather small resonance widths , even for states dominated by an @xmath133 channel , seem to be characteristic of multipolar potentials since the same prediction has been made for the @xmath142 dipolar anion @xcite .    the pattern of families shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_5 ] and [ fig_6 ] can be easily understood by considering angular momentum coupling .",
    "namely , since for @xmath181 states @xmath182 , each family of resonances represents an electron perfectly antialigned with respect to the rotor s angular momentum , and the the steadily increasing energy distance between groups is due to the centrifugal barrier that grows with @xmath121 .",
    "the states within each family can be distinguished by their radial behavior , i.e. , the number of nodes in the radial wave function .    for @xmath183 ,",
    "the angular momentum selection rule becomes : @xmath184 for @xmath185 and @xmath186 for @xmath187 .",
    "this yields 8 families ( note that since @xmath129 , there is only one channel with @xmath188 ) . as discussed below , the two families with @xmath189 and @xmath190 , marked by open symbols in figs .",
    "[ fig_5 ] and [ fig_6 ] , are practically degenerate .",
    "this explains the multiplicity of families for @xmath183 , and  in a similar way  for @xmath191 .    because many resonances belonging to low-@xmath121 channels cluster around the rotational states of the molecule , the density of resonances in the complex energy plane is high , and accidental ( near-)degeneracies occur .",
    "this results in a strong configuration mixing .",
    "such families of resonances have two dominant channel wave functions at low energy , and are referred to as `` mixed '' groups in the following . in figs .",
    "[ fig_5 ] and [ fig_6 ] , mixed groups are the ( 1,2 ) and ( 3,2 ) families for @xmath183 and the ( 0,2 ) and ( 2,2 ) families for @xmath191 .    within each of these groups ,",
    "there appear pairs of resonances , or `` doublets '' , with very close complex energies . to illustrate the strong mixing between overlapping resonances , in fig .",
    "[ fig_7 ] we show the wave functions of six @xmath130 doublets , belonging to the mixed group at the prolate configuration of fig .  [ fig_6](b ) .",
    "their dominant channel wave functions are @xmath192 and @xmath193 . for the lowest - energy doublets in a mixed group",
    "the channel mixing is maximal : the channel wave functions are almost identical and the total wave functions can be represented by their symmetric and asymmetric combinations , as in a textbook case of a two - state mixing .",
    "however , as the excitation energy increases , the doublets move apart slightly in the complex energy plane and the channel wave functions start to differ .",
    "however , the configuration mixing still remains strong .",
    "moreover , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig_7 ] , while the intrinsic densities for @xmath166 and 1 are very different within a given doublet , they show similar structures for states within the same mixed group . at low energies , the @xmath166 term dominates ( with a weight of 71% ) in each doublet and",
    "then its weight increases to about 74% for one state and decreases to about 68% for the other state of the doublet .     left : real parts of the two dominant channel wave functions of selected quasi - degenerate @xmath130 resonances of fig .",

    "as demonstrated above , for the supercritical quadrupolar molecules with @xmath196 , many resonances can exist in vicinity of the rotor energies .",

    "eigenenergy at the threshold @xcite . indeed as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the bound state energy approaches zero according to : @xmath208 where @xmath209 , @xmath210 , and @xmath211 is the critical exponent . for a spherical potential with an asymptotic falloff @xmath152 , the critical exponent should be two @xcite . in the case considered ,",
    "the quadrupolar potential is not isotropic , but the dominant g.s .",
    "channel wave function has @xmath133 .",
    "a fit of the bound - state energy for the oblate configuration , in the range of @xmath212 } $ ] , yields @xmath213 and @xmath214 , in agreement with analytical results .",
    "the transition of a bound state dominated by @xmath133 to a resonance in quadrupolar anions appears to be a second - order transition @xcite , which is understood as a continuous change of the system .",
    "this means that there is no bound state at the threshold @xcite .",
    "the shift of all resonance energies at the critical quadrupole moment is a consequence of this transition , with the bound state changing continuously to reach the energy of the first resonance state .",
    "this results in an avoided crossing between the g.s .",
    "and the first excited state , which then propagates to all excited states . avoided crossings in the eigenvalue spectrum of the hamiltonian reveal the existence of exceptional points @xcite in its complex extension .",
    "the criticality can also be assessed by considering the scattering length @xmath215 of the system at different values of @xmath158 . at low - energy ( @xmath216 ) ,",
    "the scattering length is related to the @xmath133 phase shift @xmath217 of a scattering state through : @xmath218 in our calculations , all partial waves are included up to a given orbital angular moment cutoff @xmath102 , and even if the @xmath133 component dominates at low energy , there still exist small contributions coming from higher partial waves . in order to illustrate the criticality of the system in a simple case , only the @xmath133 diagonal element of the channel - channel coupling potential has been considered . indeed , the scaled parameter @xmath219 reaches a constant  @xcite at the critical value .",
    "therefore , by changing @xmath220 so that the @xmath133 diagonal element of the potential becomes more and more important , one can effectively evolve the negative critical quadrupole moment @xmath221 for @xmath222 to the value @xmath200 of the complete problem . to this end",
    ", one has to decrease @xmath96 , or conversely increase @xmath223 , to localize the electron in a ( almost ) pure @xmath133 bound state .    in practice , by considering only @xmath224 wave , one obtains @xmath207 instead of @xmath97 for the full problem .",
    "the scattering length is plotted as a function of @xmath225 in fig .",
    "[ fig_8](d ) , and shows a characteristic divergence at the critical value .",
    "such behavior corresponds to the formation of the feshbach resonance . in the pure @xmath133 case ,",
    "the negative scattering length is associated with a virtual state , but in the full problem higher partial waves prevent formation of a resonance as shown in of fig .",
    "[ fig_8](b ) .",
    "this observation on a transition of a bound state into the continuum , together with the divergence of the scattering length , are general features of open quantum systems .",
    "in this work , we studied bound and unbound states in quadrupolar anions in a nonadiabatic molecule - plus - electron picture .",
    "the schrdinger equation of the system , expressed in a coupled - channel form , was solved by a diagonalization in the berggren basis or by means of a direct integration .",
    "the bem and the dim approaches have been benchmarked against analytical results for the critical electric quadrupole moment .",
    "it is shown that binding energies and r.m.s .",

    "eigenenergies to the bandhead energy in the adiabatic limit , we demonstrated the existence of regular rotational bands below and above the detachment threshold .",
    "the presence of the strong coupling of electron s motion to the molecular core above the threshold makes the situation in quadrupolar anions different from that in dipolar anions , where electron s motion in a resonance state becomes largely decoupled from molecular rotation @xcite .",
    "we demonstrated the presence of families of narrow resonances close to the rotational states of the molecule .",
    "the unbound spectrum contains many quasi - degenerate states , forming regular rotational bands .",
    "the presence of narrow resonances close to the threshold , even for subcritical values of @xmath21 , may produce a low - energy peak in the cross section .",
    "finally , the evolution of a bound state into the continuum can described in terms of a second order transition with the critical exponent @xmath226 .    in summary",

    "<S> in quadrupole - bound anions , an extra electron is attached at a sufficiently large quadrupole moment of a neutral molecule , which is lacking a permanent dipole moment . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the bound states and low - lying resonances of such anions is of interest for understanding the threshold behavior of open quantum systems in general . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the properties of quadrupolar anions as extreme halo systems , the formation of rotational bands , and the transition from a subcritical to supercritical electric quadrupole moment . </S>",
    "<S> we solve the electron - plus - molecule problem using a non - adiabatic coupled - channel formalism by employing the berggren ensemble , which explicitly contains bound states , narrow resonances , and the scattering continuum . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that binding energies and radii of quadrupolar anions strictly follow the scaling laws for two - body halo systems . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the case of dipolar anions , ground - state band of quadrupolar anions smoothly extend into the continuum , and many rotational bands could be identified above the detachment threshold . </S>",
    "<S> we study the evolution of a bound state of an anion as to dives into the continuum at a critical quadrupole moment and we show that the associated critical exponent is consistent with the second - order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> everything considered , quadrupolar anions represent a perfect laboratory for the studies of marginally bound open quantum systems .    </S>"
