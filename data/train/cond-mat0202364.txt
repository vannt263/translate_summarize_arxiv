    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) and superfluidity of liquid @xmath0he in random environments including aerogel and vycor glass are active problems in quantum fluid research . in particular , finding out how spatial confinement affects the bose fluid has stimulated both experimental and theoretical studies .    below the @xmath3 temperature of 2.17 k ,",
    "liquid @xmath0he enters the superfluid state and behaves as though it has no viscosity .",
    "superfluidity is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon as well as superconductivity , and understanding both have been one of the major goals of quantum statistical physics .",
    "the various observations of superfluidity was successfully explained by the phenomenological two fluid model , which is based on the idea that the system consists of an inviscid superfluid and a viscous normal fluid . on the other hand , the lambda transition had been thought to be caused by bec , which was confirmed by neutron scattering experiments . with a bec ,",
    "a macroscopic number of particles occupies a single particle ground state and is described by a macroscopic wave function .",
    "the inviscid superflow can be described by this wave function .",
    "however the relation between bec and superfluidity is not completely understood .",
    "although superfluidity and bec are closely related to each other , one is not necessary or sufficient for the other .",
    "for example , in a two - dimensional bose system , kosterlitz and thouless proved that superfluidity can exist even without bec , and the superfluidity was actually observed in @xmath0he films .",
    "the bose system in a random environment might be another good example for studying the relation between bec and superfluidity .",
    "this system has received considerable attention because localization effects allow condensed particles to belong to the normal fluid rather than the superfluid and bec can separate from the superfluid .",
    "the phase diagram of this system has been discussed , showing a specific non - superfluid phase .",
    "thus , studies of this system can reveal the relation between bec and superfluidity .",
    "porous glass such as vycor is often used as a random media in experimental studies .",
    "vycor glass is a from 30% to 70% porous glass containing wormholelike pores , the characteristic diameters of which vary from 30  to 100 . by adjusting the pore size and the adsorbed @xmath0he coverage",
    ", we can change the density of @xmath0he and the superfluid transition . by using torsional oscillators , reppy et al .",
    "interesting features at various pore sizes of vycor glass or coverages were observed , particularly the behavior of the superfluid critical temperature and the temperature dependence of the superfluid density .",
    "the superfluid component has two - dimensional behavior when the pore size of vycor glass is large , and becomes three - dimensional as the pore size is reduced .",
    "the superfluid density in such porous glass is smaller than that of bulk @xmath0he and its critical temperature decreases with the coverage . below a certain coverage ,",
    "the superfluid density can no longer exist , even near 0 k. these results show that superfluidity is broken by the random environment .",
    "it is also important to find out how disorder affects the bec .",
    "bec and its elementary excitation in liquid @xmath0he can be observed by neutron scattering .",
    "bulk @xmath0he has the usual excitations such as phonons , maxons and rotons .",
    "they are collective excitations on bec , the excitations except for phonons being absent above the critical temperature .",
    "dimeo et al . and plantevin et al .",
    "used neutron scattering and a torsional oscillator to measure the elementary excitations and the superfluid transition , respectively , of @xmath0he in porous glass .",
    "surprisingly , the dispersion curve in porous glass was the same as that in the bulk , which means that the disorder does not affect the elementary excitations .",
    "furthermore , these elementary excitations were observed even above the superfluid critical temperature .",
    "hence , the bec might persist in the disordered system even above the superfluid critical temperature .",
    "these results have not been understood completely yet ; thus , the exact relationship between bec and superfluidity remains puzzling .",
    "this problem is also interesting from the following theoretical standpoint . in a bose system confined in a random media ,",
    "the long - range - order correlation due to bec can compete with the disorder , so that the bec critical temperature can be reduced .",
    "huang and meng proposed a model of the three - dimensional dilute bose gas in a random potential that assumed a small coverage of @xmath0he in vycor glass . because it is difficult to formulate the random potential for the porous glass , they used a delta - functional impurity potential and analyzed their model using the bogoliubov transformation and taking an ensemble average .",
    "they found that both bec and superfluidity are depressed by the random potential and the superfluidity disappears below a critical density , even at 0 k , which is qualitatively consistent with the observations by reppy et al .",
    "they also predicted a reentrant transition at low densities ; that is , the superfluid phase enters a normal phase again with decreasing temperatures .",
    "however , the random potential of their model does not include the pore size , and thus it is difficult to quantitatively compare to experimental results for a range of pore sizes .",
    "another model is the bose hubbard model with the random potential . by considering the transfer energy , the on - site repulsion , and the random potential , fisher et al",
    ". found that the bose glass phase can exist with the superfluid phase and the mott insulating phase .",
    "the bose glass phase is similar to the anderson insulating phase in metal . in the bose glass phase ,",
    "the condensed particles are localized and thus do not contribute to superfluidity .",
    "thus , the bose glass phase could influence the collective excitations even above the superfluid critical temperature .",
    "however , the theoretical excitation energy for the bose glass phase disagrees with measurements by neutron scattering experiment , so it is not yet clear whether the bose glass phase has actually been detected .",
    "finally , it should be noted that huang and meng s model can not describe the bose glass phase because the ensemble average makes the system uniform .",
    "few theoretical studies of this random system are quantitatively compare to the experiment .",
    "thus , in this work , we improve huang and meng s model by adding the size dependence of the random potential instead of using their the delta - functional potentials . the strength of the random potential can be estimated by comparing calculated and experimental critical coverages below which the superfluid density disappears , even at 0 k. as a result , our model has no free parameters and can be used for quantitative comparisons to experimental data .",
    "this enables us to determine whether or not our picture of the three - dimensional dilute bose gas in random potential is applicable to a real system .",
    "our formulation can not address this question at high temperatures due to the high number of thermally excited quasi particles .",
    "as far as the condensate density is almost independent of temperature at low temperatures , however , our formulation works well , leading to the following results .",
    "( 1 ) the specific heat agrees quantitatively with experimental data at low temperatures .",
    "( 2 ) because of the random potential , the specific heat is not proportional to @xmath2 , as occurs for phonons , but to @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , by obtaining the condensate density and the superfluid density , we found the following .",
    "( 3 ) when the total density is sufficiently low , bec can persist even when the superfluid density disappears below that critical coverage .",
    "( 4 ) the random potential causes a reentrant transition of the superfluid phase .",
    "finally , we show why decreasing the open pore density of the vycor glass should allow the reentrant phase to be detected experimentally    a brief summary of our paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe our model of the dilute bose gas in a random potential and derive the partition function .",
    "section iii tests our model by quantitatively comparing calculated to experimental specific heats . in sec .",
    "iv , the bec density and the superfluid density are obtained and their characteristics are discussed .",
    "section v is discussion and conclusions .",

    "this repulsive interaction prevents all particles from being localized at the minimum of @xmath12 .",
    "this has similarities to the fermi system with disorder ; for example , fermions can not localize in a single orbital in space due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "therefore , the fermion system is stable even if it is free from the repulsive interaction . on the other hand , to prevent the system from collapsing into the minimum of @xmath9 , the bose system should include a repulsive interaction .",

    "all results here are obtained for these low temperatures .",

    "the random potential simulates vycor glass with a characteristic pore size @xmath32 as follows .",

    "<S> there is a growing interest in the relation between bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) and superfluidity . </S>",
    "<S> a bose system confined in random media such as porous glass is suitable for studying this relation because bec and superfluidity can be suppressed and controlled in such a disordered environment . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not clear how this relation is affected by disorder and there are few theoretical studies that can be quantitatively tested by experiment . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we develop the dilute bose gas model with a random potential that takes into account the pore size dependence of porous glass . </S>",
    "<S> then we compare our model with the measured low - temperature specific heat , condensate density , and the superfluid density of @xmath0he in vycor glass . </S>",
    "<S> this comparison uses no free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we predict phenomena at low temperatures that have not yet been observed . </S>",
    "<S> first , the random potential causes a @xmath1-linear specific heat instead of the @xmath2 dependence that is usually caused by phonons . </S>",
    "<S> second , the bec can remain even when the superfluidity disappears at low densities . </S>",
    "<S> and third , the system makes a reentrant transition at low densities ; that is , the superfluid phase changes to the normal phase again as the temperature is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> this reentrant transition is more likely to be observed when the strength of the random potential is increased . </S>"
