    "among the most investigated extensions of the standard model ( sm ) are those incorporating supersymmetry ( susy ) , and among these the one with the fewest allowable number of new particles and interactions , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , has certainly received considerable attention . yet , when prospective signals at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) of the new particle states within the mssm are considered , there is still much that needs clarification .",
    "nothing underscores this more than the mssm electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) higgs sector .",
    "included therein is a quintet of higgs bosons left from the two @xmath11 higgs doublets after ewsb ( see @xcite for more details ) : a charged pair , @xmath12 , the neutral @xmath13-odd @xmath7 and the neutral @xmath13-even @xmath14 and @xmath6 ( with @xmath15 ) . the entire higgs sector ( _ i.e. _ , masses and couplings to ordinary matter )",
    "can be described at tree - level by only two independent parameters : the mass of one of the five higgs states ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath5 ) and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets ( denoted by @xmath16 ) .",
    "these must be augmented to include significant radiative corrections which most notably raise the upper limit on the mass of the light higgs boson from @xmath17 at tree - level to @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) with inclusion of corrections up to two loops and assuming a stop - sector scale of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 according to @xcite , or @xmath23 with @xmath24 by @xcite ( stop mass range not specified ) .",
    "this definite upper bound will allow experimentalists to definitively rule out such a minimal susy scenario at the lhc if such a light higgs state is not observed .",
    "thus , the possible production and decay modes of the @xmath14 state have understandably been investigated in quite some detail @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the possibilities for the other heavier neutral mssm higgs bosons have not been so thoroughly examined .",
    "yet it is crucial that the avenues for discovery of these other mssm higgs bosons be well understood since , even if a candidate for @xmath14 discovery is experimentally identified , it may be indistinguishable from a sm higgs boson ( this corresponds to the so - called ` decoupling region ' , with @xmath25 and for intermediate to large values of @xmath16 @xcite )",
    ". then the additional identification of heavier higgs bosons may well be required to establish that there is in fact an extended higgs sector beyond the single doublet predicted by the sm .",
    "finding signatures for these heavier mssm higgs bosons has proved to be challenging . unlike the lone higgs boson of the sm of similar mass , couplings of these mssm higgs bosons to sm gauge bosons are either absent at tree level ( for @xmath7 ) or strongly suppressed over much of the allowed parameter space ( for @xmath6 ) .",
    "thus , identification of @xmath7 and @xmath6 via their decays into known sm particles relies chiefly on decays of said higgs bosons into the heaviest fermions available , namely , tau leptons and bottom quarks top quark couplings are suppressed relative to a sm higgs boson of the same mass . ] .",
    "identification of hadronic decays / jet showers of these third generation fermions may be problematic in the qcd - rich environment of the lhc , so that it is very questionable that the entire parameter space can be covered with just sm - like signatures .",
    "fortunately , in the mssm there is an alternative : decays of these higgs bosons into sparticles , in particular the charginos and neutralinos formed from the ew gauginos and higgsinos .",
    "higgs boson couplings to certain ino states may be substantial , and these heavy sparticles may themselves decay  except for @xmath26 which is assumed to be the stable lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp )  in readily - identifiable ways ( such as into leptons ) to provide a clean experimental signature .    a number of previous articles @xcite as well as at least one ph.d .",
    "thesis @xcite have focused on the signal potential of the decays of the heavier neutral mssm higgs bosons into neutralinos and charginos : @xmath27 therein only subsequent ino decays into leptons ( which will be taken to mean electrons and/or muons , @xmath28 ) were considered , as this is preferable from the standpoint of lhc detection . since relatively light sleptons can greatly enhance @xcite the branching ratios ( brs ) for such decays , the properties of the slepton sector of the mssm also need to be specified .",
    "all of the previous works concentrated almost were also studied in @xcite but found to be unproductive due to large backgrounds to the resulting di - lepton signals . ] exclusively on the decays @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the subsequent neutralino decays @xmath29 were typically presumed to proceed via three - body decays with an off - mass - shell intermediate @xmath30 or slepton , neglecting the possibility of the intermediate @xmath31 or slepton being on - mass - shell ( @xcite and @xcite delve in considerable depth into the distinctions between these cases ) .",
    "in this work , _ all _ the decays in ( [ allproc ] ) are incorporated .",
    "in fact , as the presumed mass of a higgs boson grows , more such decay modes will become accessible . therefore ,",
    "if decay channels to the heavier -inos are significant , they may provide signatures for heavier neutral higgs bosons ( with masses well into the aforementioned decoupling region ) .",
    "when heavier ino states are included , it also becomes easier to construct model spectra with slepton masses lying below those of the heavier inos .",
    "thus , in this work , intermediate sleptons are allowed to be both on- and off - mass - shell ( same for the @xmath32 ) or @xmath33 quark are done in @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . ] .",
    "more background channels are also emulated than in previous studies .",
    "the higgs boson production modes considered herein are @xmath34 ( gluon - fusion ) and @xmath35 ( quark - fusion ) .",
    "( the second mode is dominated by the case @xmath36 . )",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "the next section provides an overview of the mssm parameter space through calculation of inclusive rates for the relevant production and decay processes contributing to the signal .",
    "3 then specializes these results to the more restrictive minimal supergravity ( msugra ) scenario for susy breaking .",
    "4 gives the numerical results for the signal and background processes based upon monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of parton shower ( ps ) and hadronization as well as detector effects .",
    "this includes mapping out discovery regions for the lhc .",
    "the recently - introduced ` wedgebox ' method of @xcite , which is reminiscent of the time - honored dalitz plot technique , is utilized in sect .  5 to extract information about the ino mass spectra and the ino couplings to the higgs bosons .",
    "finally , the last section presents conclusions which can be drawn from this study .",
    "as noted above , @xmath5 and @xmath16 may be chosen as the mssm inputs characterizing the mssm higgs bosons decays into sm particles plus the stop masses  and the higgs / higgsino mixing mass @xmath37 . in the present work",
    "the stop masses are assumed to be heavy ( @xmath38 ) whereas @xmath39 is fixed to zero .",
    "the @xmath37 parameter is not crucial for the sm decay modes ; however , it will become so when decays to inos are considered . ] .",
    "but when higgs boson decays to inos are included , new mssm inputs specifying the ino sector also become crucial . to identify the latter , the already mentioned higgs / higgsino mixing mass , @xmath37 , and the susy - breaking @xmath11 gaugino mass , @xmath40 , in addition to @xmath16 ,",
    "are required .",
    "the susy - breaking @xmath41 gaugino mass , @xmath42 , is assumed to be determined from @xmath40 via gaugino unification ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath43 ) .",
    "this will fix the tree - level ino masses ( to which the radiative corrections are quite modest ) along with their couplings to the higgs bosons .",
    "inputs ( assumed to be flavor - diagonal ) from the slepton sector are the left and right soft slepton masses for each of the three generations ( selectrons , smuons , and staus ) and the trilinear ` @xmath44-terms ' which come attached to yukawa factors and thus only @xmath45 has a potential impact . _ a priori _ , all six left and right mass inputs ( and @xmath45 )",
    "are independent . however , in most models currently advocated , one has @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "herein these equalities are assumed to hold .      to maximize leptonic ino br enhancement",
    ", sleptons should be made as light as possible . but",
    "direct searches at lep @xcite place significant limits on slepton masses : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( these assume that the slepton is not nearly - degenerate with the lsp ) and @xmath51 ( from studies at the @xmath31 pole ) .",
    "furthermore , the sneutrino masses are closely tied to the left soft mass inputs , and , to avoid extra controversial assumptions , only regions of the mssm parameter space where the lsp is the lightest neutralino rather than a sneutrino will be considered . to optimize the ino leptonic brs without running afoul of the lep limits ,",
    "it is best , in which case @xmath52 decays to charged leptons will be suppressed with respect to @xmath52 decays to neutrinos , to avoid which having @xmath53 is preferred . ] to set @xmath54 .",
    "if all three generations have the same soft inputs ( with @xmath55 ) , then the slepton sector is effectively reduced to one optimal input value ( defined as @xmath56 ) . however , since ino decays into tau - leptons are generally not anywhere near as beneficial as those into electrons or muons , it would be even better if the stau inputs were significantly above those of the first two generations .",
    "this would enhance the inos brs into electrons and muons . in the general mssm ,",
    "one is of course free to choose the inputs as such .",
    "doing so would also weaken restrictions from lep , especially for high values of @xmath16 .",
    "1 in @xcite shows values for this optimal slepton mass over the @xmath57@xmath37 plane relevant to the ino sector for @xmath58 . setting the soft stau mass inputs @xmath59 above those of the other soft slepton masses , as will often be done herein , complies with current experimental constraints and moderately enhances the signal rates @xcite",
    ".      figs .",
    "1 , 2 and 3 show the lhc rates ( in fb ) for @xmath60 @xmath61 br@xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath61 br@xmath65 , where @xmath66 is any number ( including zero ) of invisible neutral particles ( in the mssm these are either neutrinos or @xmath26 lsps ) obtained for @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , respectively10% ; enhancement to brs may be even more .",
    "this would make rates reported in this work on the conservative low side .",
    "( hereafter this sum of processes will be abbreviated by @xmath70 @xmath61 br@xmath71 . )",
    "each figure gives separate scans of the @xmath37 _ vs. _ @xmath57 plane most relevant to the ino sector for ( from top to bottom ) @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74  covering the range of higgs boson masses of greatest interest @xcite .",
    "this is in the region of the mssm parameter space where observation of @xmath14 alone may be insufficient to distinguish the mssm higgs sector from the sm case ( _ i.e. _ , the decoupling region ) .",
    "the darkened zones seen around the lower , inner corner of each plot are the regions excluded by the experimental results from lep .",
    "first observe that these ` raw ' or ` inclusive ' ( _ i.e. _ , before applying selection cuts to the basic event - type ) rates may be sufficiently large . for an integrated luminosity of @xmath75 , the peak raw event number is around 4000(1700 ) events for @xmath72(@xmath76 ) gev and @xmath77 , irrespective of the sign of @xmath37 . also observe that low values of @xmath78 and @xmath57 yield the highest signal rates , though significant event numbers are also found when one but not the other of these parameters is increased ( especially @xmath78 ; rates do fall rapidly when @xmath57 increases much beyond @xmath79 ) .",
    "these numbers are substantial ( especially at high @xmath16 ) and , if experimental efficiencies are good , they may facilitate a much more accurate determination of some masses or at least mass differences in the -ino spectrum as well as the higgs - ino mass differences than those achieved in previous studies based solely on @xmath2 decays .",
    "note the color coding of the three figures depicting what percentage of the signal events are coming from higgs boson decays to @xmath80 : @xmath81% in the red zones , from @xmath82% down to @xmath83% in the yellow zones , from @xmath83% to @xmath68% in the blue zones , and @xmath84% in uncolored regions . if the events are not coming from @xmath80 , then they are almost always from higgs boson decays including heavier neutralinos , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath85 ( possibly also with contributions from @xmath86 which are also taken into account here ) . also note that the main source of events at the optimal location in the ino parameter space shifts from @xmath80 to heavier ino pairs as @xmath5 grows from @xmath87 to @xmath74 .",
    "irrespective of the heavier higgs boson masses , higgs boson decays to @xmath80 are the dominant source of signal events in regions with low @xmath57 values and moderate to high values of @xmath78 .",
    "but for low to moderate @xmath57 values and low values of @xmath78 , the dominant source of signal events shifts to the previously - neglected decays into the heavier inos .",
    "thus , inclusion of these neglected modes opens up an entirely new sector of the mssm parameter space for exploration .",
    "furthermore , the parameter space locations with the maximum number of signal events also shifts to these new sectors as the masses of the higgs bosons rise .",
    "therefore , the regions in mssm parameter space wherein @xmath70 @xmath61 br@xmath71 processes can be utilized in the search for the heavier mssm higgs bosons will certainly expand substantially with inclusion of these additional decay channels .",
    "the rates illustrated in figs .",
    "13 incorporate indirect decay modes .",
    "that is , if the higgs boson decays into a pair of neutralinos , and then one or both of these ` primary ' neutralinos decay into other neutralinos ( or other sparticles or the light higgs boson or both on- and off - mass - shell sm gauge bosons ) which in turn give rise to leptons ( _ with no additional colored daughter particles _ ) , then the contribution from such a decay chain is taken into account .",
    "this remains true no matter how many decays there are in the chain between the primary ino and the @xmath88 final state , the only restrictions being that each decay in the chain must be a tree - level decay with at most one virtual intermediate state ( so @xmath89 to @xmath90 decay processes are included but not @xmath89 to @xmath91 decays , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "( as already intimated , the intermediate state is expected to be an on- or off - mass - shell sm gauge boson or slepton , charged or neutral . )",
    "the decay modes omitted due to these restrictions are never expected to be significant .",
    "thus , effectively all tree - level decay chains allowable within the mssm have been taken into account .",
    "potential contributions from literally thousands of possible decay chains are evaluated and added to the results .",
    "inspection of figs .",
    "13 supports selection of the following representative points in the mssm parameter space to be employed repeatedly in this work .",
    "these are : 0.6 cm * point 1*. @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath37 = @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",

    "0.6 cm ( also recall that @xmath108 and @xmath109 . )",
    "point 1 represents a case where most of the signal events result from @xmath110 decays , whereas point 2 is a case where decays including heavier -inos make the dominant contribution . here",
    "@xmath16 has been set fairly high to enhance rates , as figs .",
    "13 suggest .    in fig .  4 ,",
    "the parameter values of point 1 ( left plot ) and point 2 ( right plot ) are adopted , save that the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath16 are allowed to vary , generating plots in the @xmath5 _ vs. _ @xmath16 plane . color shading on the left - side plot",
    "clearly shows that the @xmath80 decay modes totally dominate in the production of @xmath111 signal events for this choice of @xmath57 , @xmath37 -ino inputs out to @xmath112 .",
    "similarly , the right - side plot shows that for the ino inputs of point 2 the previously neglected decay modes to heavier inos dominate , save for a relatively small region around @xmath5 @xmath113 @xmath114-@xmath115 and @xmath116-@xmath68 .",
    "color coding as in figs .",
    ".    it will be noteworthy to compare the declines in raw rates with increasing @xmath5 and decreasing @xmath16 shown here to the corresponding @xmath5 _ vs. _ @xmath16 discovery region plots based on detailed simulation analyses presented in the analysis section to follow .",
    "5 illustrates how results depend on the slepton mass(es ) . in the upper plot , showing the overall rate , @xmath70",
    "@xmath61 br@xmath71 , as a function of @xmath117 , one generally sees the naively expected decline in the rate as @xmath118 increases",
    ". if the inos decay through on- or off - mass - shell sleptons , then the decay products always include leptons ( and usually charged leptons ) .",
    "however , as the sleptons become heavier ( first becoming kinematically inaccessible as on - mass - shell intermediates and then growing increasingly disfavored as off - mass - shell intermediates ) , the ew gauge bosons become the dominant intermediates , in which case a large fraction of the time the decay products will be non - leptons , and so the br to the @xmath111 final state drops .",
    "the plot though also reveals an often far more complex dependence on @xmath118 , with rapid oscillations in the rate possible for modest changes in @xmath118 .",
    "note again that point 1 , drawn in red in fig .",
    "5 , represents a case where most of the signal events result from @xmath119 decays , whereas point 2 , drawn in blue , is a case where decays including heavier inos make the dominant contribution .",
    "this is made clear by the lower plot where the percentage of the inclusive rate from @xmath80 decays is plotted _ vs.  _ @xmath118 . in fig .",
    "5 , the slepton mass is varied .",
    "but later in this work the value of @xmath118 will be fixed at the values given earlier for points 1 .  and 2.(these locations are marked by asterisks in both plots in fig .  5 ) .",
    "these choices are fairly optimal , especially for point 1 .",
    "points 1 .  and 2 .",
    "show some interesting dependence on @xmath118 .",
    "this dependence can be made more acute though by adjusting the input parameters .",
    "for instance , the black dotted and dashed curves in fig .  5 result from lowering the @xmath5 value of point 2 to @xmath120 and changing @xmath16 from @xmath121 to @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively . then",
    "not only does the inclusive rate undergo rapid variation with @xmath118 , but the percentage of the inclusive rate from @xmath80 decays fluctuates rapidly as well .",
    "points 1 .  and 2 .",
    "were selected for further analysis later in this work in part because the results are not strongly affected by a small shift in the value of @xmath118 .",
    "however , apparently this is not true for all points in mssm parameter space .",
    "finally , notice that the overall normalization of both processes @xmath124 and @xmath125 is of @xmath126 lowest - order approach based on mc implementation of @xmath127 diagrams .",
    "the results of these two approaches have been compared and contrasted in ref .",
    "a full mc implementation for the @xmath128 approach based on @xmath129 and related modes ( eventually yielding two jets in the final state alongside @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) @xcite ) is as - of - yet unavailable though in public event generators .",
    "it is therefore more consistent to solely employ _ complete _ @xmath130 emulations and not _ incomplete _ @xmath131 ones . ] .",
    "each of these gluon- and quark - fusion partonic contributions is separately convoluted with an empirical set of pdfs ( cteq 6 m @xcite in this case ) to obtain predictions at the proton - proton level , for which the total center - of - mass energy is @xmath132 .",
    "the cross - section thus defined is computed using the mssm implementation @xcite of the herwig program @xcite ( as available in version 6.5 @xcite , with the exception of the choices @xmath133 and @xmath134 for the top and bottom quark masses ) and the mssm input information produced by isasusy ( through the isawig @xcite and hdecay @xcite interfaces ) .",
    "sometimes a higgs boson will be produced in association with jets , and thus , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , what percentage of the time a higgs boson is produced with hadronic activity passing jet selection criteria ( as will be applied in the analysis section ) is ( possibly ) sensitive to the type of emulation ( @xmath126 or @xmath128 ) being employed .",
    "note though that in figs .",
    "14 colored fermions are not allowed in the ino decay chains .",
    "this is in fact inconsistent and leads to an over-(under-)estimate of the hadronically - quiet ( inclusive , allowing jets ) @xmath8 rates ( the under - estimation of the inclusive rates is expected to be modest due to the price of extra brs in the decay chains of the neglected channels ) . to attempt to correct for this by factoring in results from the simulation",
    "runs might obscure what is meant by raw rates , so this minor inconsistency is simply tolerated in these estimates .",
    "the signal , taken here to be events resulting from heavy mssm higgs bosons decaying into ino pairs , is not the only relevant quantity in this analysis that depends on the position in the mssm parameter space  backgrounds from other mssm processes will also vary from point to point .",
    "1 of @xcite shows the competing processes for ino pair - production via higgs boson decays ( @xmath135 ) . ] : direct ino production ( _ i.e. _ , _ via _ a s - channel gauge boson ) and inos produced in cascade decays of squarks and gluinos .",
    "the latter is considered in some detail in @xcite , but will be removed from consideration here by making the assumption throughout this work that gluinos and squarks are heavy ( _ circa _",
    "@xmath136 ) .",
    "however , since the signal depends on them , ( all ) the inos can not be made heavy final state desired here .",
    "the smaller contributions from these processes are included in the analyses to follow .",
    "] , and the masses of the ew gauge bosons are known , so the direct channel background can not be easily removed by restricting the analysis to some subset of the parameter space by means of such a straight - forward assumption .    in fact , the location in the parameter space where the raw signal rate is largest sometimes differs from that where the ratio of the signal to the leading background from direct ino production is largest .",
    "for instance , the plot in fig .  2",
    "( @xmath137 ) for @xmath138 shows a maximum in the inclusive rate at approximately @xmath139 . on the other hand ,",
    "the signal - to - background ratio ( @xmath140 ) is largest at @xmath141 .",
    "the production cross - section for the higgs bosons is the same at both points .",
    "thus , to understand why the two locations differ so much the br@xmath71 and the direct ino production @xmath61 br@xmath142 -inos @xmath143 need to be studied .",
    "the former drops from @xmath144% to @xmath145% in moving from the inclusive rate maximum to the @xmath140 maximum ( thus cutting the overall signal rate by a factor of 3 ) .",
    "the background at the inclusive rate maximum is mostly @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 with respective production cross - sections ( and brs into @xmath88 final states ) of @xmath149 ( @xmath150% ) , @xmath151 ( @xmath152% ) and @xmath151 ( @xmath153% ) . at the point where the @xmath140 is a maximum , these ( still dominant ) backgrounds rates shift to @xmath151 ( @xmath154% ) , @xmath155 ( @xmath156% ) and @xmath151 ( @xmath153% ) , respectively .",
    "so the @xmath157 production rate drops by a factor of @xmath91 while @xmath158 production almost vanishes ( which is the main factor ) , mostly because of increased phase space suppression due to larger ino masses : @xmath159\\{m_{{\\widetilde\\chi}^\\pm_2}\\}$ ] changes from @xmath160\\{289\\}\\ , \\hbox{gev}$ ] at the rate maximum to @xmath161\\{515\\}\\ , \\hbox{gev}$ ] at the @xmath140 maximum .",
    "the result is that the overall background rate drops by a factor of 5 . in short ,",
    "the @xmath140 improves because the direct ino pair - production cross - section falls more rapidly than the signal br into @xmath88 final states .",
    "analogous plots to those in figs .",
    "13 studying the @xmath140 variation across the parameter space are not presented . instead",
    ", discovery regions for selected ino input parameter sets will be given in sect .",
    "while favorable mssm points have been chosen for the simulation analyses , they were not selected to maximize the @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , this channel may work even better at points other than those analysed in detail herein .",
    "augmenting the general mssm with additional assumptions about the unification of susy inputs at a very high mass scale yields the more restrictive msugra models . here the number of free input parameters is much reduced ( hence the popularity of such scenarios for phenomenological analyses ) , with said free parameters generally set as @xmath16 , a universal gaugino mass defined at the grand unification theory ( gut ) scale ( @xmath162 ) , a universal gut - level scalar mass ( @xmath163 ) , a universal gut - level trilinear scalar mass term ( @xmath164 ) , and the sign of @xmath37 ( henceforth , sgn@xmath165 ) . as already noted",

    "these cms tdr discovery regions assume an integrated luminosity of just @xmath173 , and thus would have certainly been considerably larger if a base luminosity of @xmath75 was used instead .",
    "this cms tdr analysis was at a technical level comparable to that in this work , _ but only considered mssm higgs boson decays into @xmath169 pairs_. thus , the cms tdr analysis would not pick up the region where heavier ino decays dominate ( in fact the plots in fig .",

    "the brs of @xmath6 and @xmath7 to the assorted ino pairs can certainly differ markedly in regions where the signal is large , as seen for instance in table 3 ; thus one must not assume that the two contribute a roughly equal number of events to the @xmath284 signal rate .",
    "on the other hand , results also show that only in quite narrow low-@xmath5 threshold regions within the discovery areas ( wherein the small @xmath291-@xmath5 mass difference is crucial ) do events due to one or the other higgs boson ( in this case the lighter @xmath7 ) totally dominate , producing in excess of @xmath82% of the signal events .",

    "note that in comparing the signal with the mssm backgrounds , the present study follows the standard procedure of comparing signal and background rates at the same point in the mssm parameter space .",
    "one could well ask whether or not larger backgrounds at a different point in parameter space could lead to the number of excess events attributed to the signal at the designated point in the mssm parameter space .",

    "analyses of selected points in parameter space , again at the full event generator + detector simulation level , are presented illustrating that : ( 1 ) small changes in the mssm input parameters can lead to significant topological changes in the pattern observed on the wedgebox plot ; ( 2 ) the signal and background events often have markedly different distribution patterns on the wedgebox plot , pointing toward the possibility of further purifying cuts ( perhaps in conjunction with extra information garnered from other studies or additional assumptions to clarify of what one is obtaining a purer sample ) such as the example presented for plot @xmath229 of fig .",
    "[ point2wedgewbplot ] ; and ( 3 ) the composition of the @xmath281 signal , that is , what percentages are due to @xmath270 for different @xmath295 and @xmath296 , may be ascertained to some level .",

    "the locations of the edges of such features on the wedgebox plot also provide information about the sparticle spectrum .",
    "the densities of event points in each component of wedgebox checkerboard can also be used to distinguish wedgebox plots with the same topological features / edges , such as , for instance , telling a wedgebox plot with a @xmath153-@xmath90 wedge and a @xmath153-@xmath153 box from one with only a @xmath153-@xmath90 wedge .",
    "further , these point density distributions may be used to reconstruct information about the relative production rates of the different @xmath270 processes , though extracting such ` dynamical ' information may well be far more complicated than is the task of extracting ` kinematical ' information about the sparticle spectrum from the locations of the edges .",
    "all of this is further complicated by the remaining background events , and a more holistic study looking at both the higgs boson produced signal and the mssm backgrounds together may be most appropriate @xcite .",

    "the restrictions on @xmath300 , which are absent from @xcite , also aid in removing residual background events .",
