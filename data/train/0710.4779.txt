    "the time evolution of the probability densities of trajectories @xmath0 , ruled by the perron - frobenius ( pf ) operator @xmath1 as @xmath2 , have been extensively studied @xcite .    due to liouville s theorem ,",
    "@xmath1 can be represented by a unitary operator in a hilbert space .",
    "consequently , its resolvent @xmath3 is singular on the unit circle in the complex @xmath4-plane , and the matrix elements of @xmath5 are discontinuous there .",

    "it is necessary to analytically continue the resolvent across the continuous spectrum of @xmath1 from the outside to the inside of the unitary circle .",
    "these resonances characterize the irreversible behavior of chaotic dynamics @xcite . in particular , the nontrivial ( @xmath7 ) maximal pr resonance leads the exponential decay of distribution and correlation functions @xcite .",
    "the pr resonances have attracted considerable attention not only in classical dynamics but also in quantum systems @xcite , and some numerical and semi - analytical schemes where recently developed for calculate them .",
    "blum and agam proposed a variational method to locate the leading resonances @xcite . although their results describe the aparent formation of a leading quartet for two particular map cases , verified by respective numerical diagonalization of @xmath1 , the leading resonance calculated diverges for a set of values of @xmath8 in the standard map case when this approach breaks down .",
    "florido et al .",
    "extended this variational approach in a class of numerical methods in which memory function and filter diagonalization techniques are utilized by means of interpolating exponentials @xcite .",
    "usually , there are two standard ways to calculate the pr resonances : one is based on the numerical diagonalization of the operator @xmath1 , for which the resonances are directly calculated from its eigenvalues @xcite , the other , through the zeros of the classical ruelle zeta - function , that is derived from the trace of the resolvent of @xmath1 @xcite . in the last case , there are analytical calculations of these resonances for some hyperbolic systems ( for which this formalism is rigourous ) such as the multibaker map @xcite , geodesic motion in billiards of constant negative curvature @xcite , and hard - disk scatterers @xcite . on the other hand , many physically realistic systems are mixed , and analytical procedures to determine resonances for this cases are thus in demand .    the motivation of the present brief report is to calculate analytically the leading pr resonances for slow ( diffusive ) and faster modes of dynamics for the general class of two - dimensional area - preserving maps : @xmath9 defined on the cylinder @xmath10 . here",

    "we expect that the coefficients @xmath82 become negligible as @xmath90 increases .",

    "the non null poles of the projected resolvent ( [ rational ] ) form the leading resonances of the pf operator @xmath95 .",
    "first , we have @xmath96 due to ( [ eqsum ] ) , thus @xmath97 unless @xmath98 for the particular case of the sawtooth map @xmath99 .",
    "considering @xmath100 as the dominant term , @xmath101 ( for @xmath102 ) and @xmath103 must be the @xmath104 perturbative terms of the @xmath105-expansion ( [ rational ] ) . neglecting only @xmath106 terms on the @xmath82 coefficients , the poles of the rational form ( [ rational ] )",

    "note that , for odd impulse function @xmath11 , the leading resonance ( [ lnpr ] ) is invariant under the change @xmath116 .",
    "for very large values of @xmath8 , the leading resonance ( [ lnpr ] ) tends to the following value : @xmath117 obtained in a different way by khodas et al . for the standard",

    "it is important to check the limits of validity of each approximation and its respective adequacy to the numerical values existing in the literature . in fig .",

    "once the resonance ( [ lnpr ] ) is dominated by initial mode @xmath121 , we select @xmath122 and @xmath123 as the best simulated correlations",

    "moreover , the precise composition of the observable @xmath76 as a possible superposition of modes @xmath124 for which @xmath125 decay through ( [ lnpr ] ) is not known . on the other hand , we also include the two values of leading resonances calculated numerically by diagonalization of @xmath1 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 by blum and agam @xcite , in addition to the leading intermediary value calculated by florido et al . for @xmath126 ( assumed here between @xmath128 and @xmath129 ) @xcite . by comparing all these results ,",
    "the theoretical result ( [ lnpr ] ) gives a better qualitative fit with the numerical values even for high values of @xmath8 and , besides , it reveals a more intrincated structure of peaks for the maximal resonance .",

    "in conclusion , we have presented a method to determine analytically leading pollicott - ruelle resonances which is applicable to a general class of area - preserving maps , including mixed systems .",
    "such resonances are obtained through the resolvent of the pf operator by using projection operator techniques . in particular , we calculate the leading resonance related to the slow modes of relaxation , which corresponds to the diffusive process , as well as the leading resonance related to the faster modes of relaxation . in this last case ,",
