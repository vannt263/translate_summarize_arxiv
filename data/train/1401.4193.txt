    "the results of the renormalization group analysis of the model based on the @xmath51 top quark mass should be taken on the equal footing with the ones obtained from the directly measured top quark mass .",
    "the subject of the stability of vacuum has been extensively discussed in the recent paper  @xcite and we will not delve into it further , because it is not the main subject of our paper .",

    "jarlskog s @xmath3 and @xmath20 are invariant upon rescaling of the quark yukawa couplings , because they are the ratios of @xmath9 and the suitable powers of the eigenvalues of the quark yukawa couplings .",
    "these parameters have slow variation with energy and one can conclude that the diagonalizing matrices of the yukawa couplings and the ckm matrix also have slow dependence on energy .",
    "the evolution of @xmath3 is very remarkable : the one and two loop evolution are almost identical , but the dependence of @xmath3 on the top quark mass is significant ( see fig.[fig:6 ] ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath3 grows with the energy and its value at the planck s scale is approximately 25  % larger than at the top mass .",
    "such a value is not sufficient for the explanation of the cosmological analysis of the baryon asymmetry and new sources of cp - violation are needed ( see , e.g. , a recent paper on a discussion of the two higgs doublets extension of the sm , compatible with the observed value of the higgs boson ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the next important result is the structure of the eigenvalues of the @xmath0 matrix . if one expands the matrix @xmath0 in powers of the ckm matrix @xmath57 , then the leading order term of @xmath9 vanishes .",
    "the approximate values of the eigenvalues of the @xmath0 matrix are equal @xmath58 where @xmath57 and @xmath59 are the parameters of the ckm matrix in the wolfenstein parameterization .",
    "notice that the first two eigenvalues cancel each other exactly in this approximation .",
    "the smallness of @xmath20 follows from the smallness of the third eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath0 and this is a consequence of the hierarchy of the quark yukawa couplings .",
