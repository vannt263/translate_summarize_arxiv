    "the densification and expansion of wireless networks pose new challenges on interference management and reducing energy consumption . in a dense heterogeneous network ( hetnet ) , base stations ( bss ) are typically deployed to satisfy the peak traffic volume and they are expected to have low activity outside rush hours such as nighttime .",
    "there is a high potential for energy saving if bss can be switched off according to the traffic load .",
    "obviously , cell activation is coupled with user association : the users in the muted cells must be re - associated with other bss . in addition ,",
    "cell muting and user re - association impose further challenges on interference management , since the user may not be connected to the bs with the strongest signal strength .",
    "this interference issue can be resolved by interference coordination , i.e. , properly sharing the channels among multiple cells and then distributing them to the associated users in each cell .",
    "hence , to obtain energy - efficient resource management strategies , multicell multiuser channel assignment should be integrated into the optimization of the cell activation and user association .",
    "however , the resource management that considers the above elements jointly is very challenging mathematically because the inter - cell interference coupling leads to the inherent non - convexity in the optimization problems . to make the problems tractable",
    ", the previous studies relied on worst - case interference assumption @xcite , average interference assumption @xcite , or neglecting inter - cell interference @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the interference was assumed _ static _ ( or absent ) , i.e. , independent of the resource allocation decisions in each cell , when estimating the user achievable rate .",
    "clearly , this is a suboptimal design because the bs deactivation will cause interference fluctuation in the network , hence affecting the user rate .",
    "this paper is developing a new framework for energy - efficient resource management to consider the interference coupling caused by cell deactivation .",
    "the idea is to pre - calculate the user rate under each possible _ interference pattern _",
    "( i.e. an interference scenario in the network , described as one combination of on / off activities of the bss ) , and then perform resource allocation among these patterns .",
    "this allocation yields the actual interference and the corresponding user achievable rates that well match the interference at the same time .",
    "consider a downlink hetnet , where a number of small cells are embedded in the conventional macro cellular network .",
    "the set of all ( macro and small ) cells is denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "the cells can be switched on or off every time period @xmath1 ( say , many minutes ) . in this relatively long decision period ,",
    "we adopt test points as an abstract concept to represent demands of users @xcite .",
    "the test points can be chosen from typical user locations , or we can simply partition the geographic region into pixels and then each pixel becomes one test point .",
    "the set of test points is denoted by @xmath2 ( in our model , each test point can represent multiple co - located users ) .",
    "the traffic demand of each test point @xmath3 is represented by a minimum required average rate @xmath4 during one period of @xmath1 , which is assumed known via traffic estimation algorithms .",
    "we are interested in developing adaptive strategies for every period of @xmath1 to accommodate the traffic requirement with minimum network energy consumption , taking into account the inter - cell interference coupling .",
    "the enabling mechanism is to characterize the interference by specifying the interference patterns , each of which defines a particular on / off combination of bss .",
    "we use the pattern activity vector @xmath5 to indicate the on / off activity of the bss under pattern @xmath6 , where @xmath7 we denote the set of pre - defined patterns by @xmath8 and further define the matrix @xmath9 to combine the activity vectors for all candidate patterns . in order to fully characterize the interference scenarios in a network of @xmath10 cells , generally speaking ,",
    "@xmath11 patterns are needed . however , since bss with large distance have weak mutual interference , omitting some patterns will not affect the accurate estimation of user achievable rates .",
    "we will discuss more on this next ( see proposition 1 in section [ sec : rate - constr - energy ] ) .",
    "based on the above pattern definition , we establish a framework to optimize the cell activation , test point ( user ) association and multicell multiuser channel assignment jointly .",
    "firstly , the multi - cell channel allocation is translated into partitioning the spectrum across all patterns . in a slow timescale considered in this paper ,",
    "all frequency resources can be assumed to have equal channel conditions .",
    "denote the spectrum allocation profile by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 represents the fraction of the total bandwidth allocated to pattern @xmath6 and @xmath14 .",
    "then the total bandwidth fraction allocated to bs @xmath15 is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the @xmath15-th row of the matrix @xmath18",
    ".    secondly , denote by @xmath19 the fraction of resources that bs @xmath15 allocates to test point @xmath20 under pattern @xmath6 .",
    "naturally , each bs is allowed to use up to @xmath13 resources under pattern @xmath6 for its associated test points , expressed as @xmath21 .",
    "note that the association is implicitly indicated by @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23 means test point @xmath20 is associated with bs @xmath15 under pattern @xmath6 , while zero value of @xmath22 means that they are not connected . in this formulation ,",
    "test point @xmath20 is allowed to be connected to multiple bss .",
    "this can be equivalently viewed as multiple users co - located at the same test point , and each bs serves one user individually . in this paper , we assume a single - user detector at each receiver .",
    "finally , we define the usage of bs @xmath15 as @xmath24 .",
    "the definition of @xmath22 leads to @xmath25 .      assuming flat power spectral density ( psd ) of bs transmit power and the noise , the received sinr of the link connecting bs @xmath15 to test point @xmath20 under pattern @xmath6 is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the cell activation indicator as given in ( [ pattern_actvect ] ) , @xmath28 is the psd of bs @xmath15 , @xmath29 is the received noise psd .",
    "we denote the channel gain between bs @xmath15 and test point @xmath20 over the @xmath30-th frequency resource by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the large - scale coefficient including antenna gain , path loss and shadowing , and @xmath33 accounts for the small - scale fading .",
    "we assume @xmath34 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) .",
    "hence , the ergodic rate of test point @xmath20 served by the @xmath15-th bs under pattern @xmath6 can be written as @xmath35 } _ { \\triangleq r_{kbi } }   = \\alpha_{kbi } r_{kbi}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the system bandwidth , @xmath37 .",
    "finally , the total rate of test point @xmath20 is obtained by summing up the contributions from all associated bss and patterns , as @xmath38 note that @xmath39 can be pre - calculted using ( [ ratepercarrier ] ) and hence treated as constants during the optimization .",
    "as mentioned previously , the bs usage vector is defined as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 . a typical power consumption model for bss consists of two types of power consumption : fixed power consumption and dynamic power consumption that is proportional to bs s utilization @xcite .",
    "denote by @xmath42 the maximum operational power of bs @xmath15 if it is fully utilized ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) , which includes power consumption for transmit antennas as well as power amplifier , cooling equipment and so on .",
    "we can then express the total power consumption by all bss as    rcl [ eq:19 ] p^ = _",
    "b    where @xmath44 $ ] is the portion of the fixed power consumption for bs @xmath15 as long as it is switched on , and @xmath45 is the function that takes the value of 0 if @xmath46 or the value 1 otherwise . note that by setting @xmath47 we arrive at a constant energy consumption model considered in @xcite , which is a reasonable assumption for macro bss .",
    "however , the small bss such as pico or femto bss may have smaller value of @xmath48 because they do not usually have a big power amplifier or cooling equipment .",
    "the joint optimization of cell activation , user association and interference coordination for energy saving can be formulated as    rcl[p1_rateconstrained ] _ , & & p^= _ b [ obj ] + & & _ b = _ k _ i _ kbi ,   b [ cons_rho ] + & & _ i _ b _ kbi r_kbi d_k ,  k [ conqos ] + & & _ k _ kbi _ i , b ,  i [ const_bs allo ] + & & _ i _ i = 1 [ cons_pi ] + & & _ i 0 ,  i , _ kbi 0 ,   k , b , i [ con_nonnegative ]    where specifies the traffic demand of all test points , and all variables and parameters have been explained in section [ sec : system - model ] .    the difficulty of solving lies in two facts .",
    "the first is the combinatorial objective function involving the @xmath49-norm .",
    "the other is that the number of all possible patterns in the network grows exponentially with the number of cells as @xmath11 , resulting in huge problem dimension for a moderate - sized network .",
    "fortunately , the following proposition [ prop0 ] identifies that only a small number of patterns out of @xmath11 are needed for resource allocation to achieve the optimality .",
    "[ prop0 ] there exists an optimal solution to problem that activates at most @xmath50 patterns , i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "the proof is provided in the appendix . the sparsity structure identified by this proposition",
    "is exploited for the proposed dual cutting plane method to reduce the computational complexity ( see section [ sec : complexity - algorithm ] for more discussion ) .",
    "we now turn the attention to solving ( [ p1_rateconstrained ] ) assuming it is feasible .",
    "the idea is to apply _",
    "reweighted @xmath52-norm minimization methods _",
    "@xcite , originally proposed to enhance the data acquisition in compressed sensing .",
    "it is known that for nonnegative scalar @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xcite . with a small design parameter @xmath55",
    ", we neglect the limit and then approximate the @xmath49-norm as @xmath56 relying on ( [ mm_obj ] ) and ignoring unnecessary constants , the problem ( [ p1_rateconstrained ] ) can be approximately solved by the following problem :    rcl[p_approx ] _ ( , ) & & f ( ) _ b   + & & _ b = _ k _ i _ kbi ,   b + & & _ i _ b _ kbi r_kbi d_k ,  k.    where @xmath57 is defined by ( [ const_bs allo ] ) , ( [ cons_pi ] ) and ( [ con_nonnegative ] ) .    note that ( [ p_approx ] ) is a continuous problem unlike the one in ( [ p1_rateconstrained ] ) involving combinatorial terms .",
    "however , problem ( [ p_approx ] ) is not convex since it minimizes a concave function .",
    "fortunately , it falls into the framework of difference - of - convex ( dc ) functions and therefore can be efficiently solved by the convex - concave procedure @xcite .",
    "specifically , by applying the first - order taylor expansion to the objective function in ( [ p_approx ] ) at the point @xmath58 obtained in @xmath59-th iteration , we arrive at the following problem for the @xmath60-th iteration :    rcl[p_rateconst_l1_reweighted ] _ ( , ) & & _ b w_b^(t ) _ k_i _ kbi + & & _ i _ b _ kbi r_kbi d_k ,  k [ consdualrate ]    where @xmath61 with @xmath62    it can be shown , by applying the results in @xcite , that any limiting point of @xmath63 generated by the above convex - concave procedure as @xmath64 is a stationary point of the problem . in practice , the reweighted @xmath52 method converges typically within 6 - 10 iterations and the largest improvement in sparsity is obtained in the first few iterations .",
    "problem is a linear program .",
    "it can be efficiently solved by , e.g. , interior - point methods , if the problem dimension @xmath65 is small .",
    "however , it is also desirable to solve by involving a large number of patterns",
    ". this could happen when we consider all possible @xmath11 patterns in order to calculate an optimal performance benchmark in a reasonable - sized network , or when the pre - selection still results in lots of candidate patterns for a large - scale network .",
    "in such case , the state - of - the - art interior - point solvers can not be applied , since they typically have cubic computational complexity in the problem dimension @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the problem has an interesting structure that facilitates a tailored cutting plane method to solve the dual problem .    by dualizing the constraint of ( [ consdualrate ] )",
    ", we can express the dual function as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the lagrangian multiplier .",
    "the corresponding dual problem can be stated as @xmath68    since the strong duality holds for this linear program , the original primal problem can be alternatively solved by the dual problem .",
    "following the idea of cutting plane methods , we formulate a master problem as    rcl[dualprob_energy_master ] _",
    "> 0 , z & & z + & & _ k , b , i_kbi^(t , j ) w_b^(t ) -_k , b , i _",

    "the master problem ( [ dualprob_energy_master ] ) is refined for the next iteration by adding @xmath72 to the constraint ( [ consmaster ] ) . in this way",
    ", we iteratively solve ( [ dualprob_energy_master ] ) and ( [ dualprob_energy_inner ] ) until @xmath73 , implying that we have solved the problem ( [ p_rateconst_l1_reweighted ] ) in the dual domain .",
    "the difficulty with huge dimension has now been encapsulated in problem and nicely resolved thanks to the following proposition [ prop2 ] .",
    "the master problem is a linear problem with small dimension ( not involving @xmath11 term ) that can be trivially solved using any standard solver .",
    "[ prop2 ] the problem has a closed - form solution that can be expressed as @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 with @xmath77 , and @xmath78_{- } $ ] , where @xmath79_{- } = \\min(0,x)$ ] .    after solving by the cutting plane , the primal solution can be found as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.6 ) : @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where @xmath82 are the dual variables corresponding to the inequality constraints of , which are available if we solve the problem by off - the - shelf interior - point solvers .",
    "finally , the outermost iteration is to adjust the weights according to ( [ eq_weight ] ) and ( [ eq_cellload ] ) and then the problem ( [ p_rateconst_l1_reweighted ] ) is solved again with the new weights until convergence .",
    "if problem considering all possible pattern is directly solved by interior - point methods , the complexity is roughly @xmath83 .",
    "by contrast , every iteration of the proposed dual algorithm requires finding a solution to by proposition [ prop2 ] , and a solution to by interior - point solvers . specifically",
    ", solving requires @xmath65 , while the complexity of solving depends on the number of constraints in , which is increased by one inequality per iteration .",
    "our numerical experiment suggests that the number of iterations is roughly proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "( this can be explained by the inherent sparsity structure of the solution identified by proposition 1 .",
    "since the proposed algorithm activates one pattern per iteration ( see ) , the number of iteration is unsurprisingly much lower than @xmath85 if @xmath85 is large ) .",
    "consequently , it is safe to bound the complexity of solving as @xmath86 per iteration .",
    "hence , the overall complexity of the proposed algorithm for solving is @xmath87 , much smaller than directly applying interior - point solvers to . in table 1 , we report the algorithm running time for a network consisting of @xmath88 users and @xmath89 cells , where the proposed algorithm outperforms a commercial solver ( gurobi @xcite with the barrier method ) , as @xmath85 increases .    .algorithm running time . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the cutting plane method should be initialized with a strictly primal feasible solution in terms of , otherwise the master problem will become unbounded in the first iteration .",
    "we can solve the following rate balancing problem to test the feasibility of and obtain a strictly primal feasible solution if the original problem is feasible :    rcl[p_ratebalancing ] _",
    "r _ & & - r _ + & & _ k r _ - _ i _ b _ kbi r_kbi 0 ,  k [ con_ratebal_1 ]    where @xmath90 . note that problem is always feasible .",
    "we can again apply cutting plane method to solve it , but without worrying about the initialization ( since we can always decrease @xmath91 to make sure is strictly satisfied ) .",
    "we consider a network consisting of 3 macro cells , each of which contains 4 randomly dropped pico cells as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_network ] .",
    "the parameters for propagation modeling and simulations follow the suggestions in 3gpp evaluation methodology , and summarized in table i of @xcite . based on the linear relationship between transmit power and operational power consumption , where @xmath28 is the transmit power for bs @xmath15 , @xmath92 and @xmath93w if @xmath15 is a macro ;",
    "otherwise @xmath94 and @xmath95w if @xmath15 is a pico . ] , we calculate the maximum operational power @xmath96 as 439w and 38w for macro and pico bss , respectively .",
    "we further assume each macro bs has a constant power consumption , i.e. , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and the fixed power consumption of a pico takes @xmath99 of the maximum operational power , i.e. @xmath100 , @xmath101 . note that these assumptions are made for providing concrete numerical results , and they are not from the restriction of our formulation .",
    "the baseline strategy in comparison is the energy saving optimization scheme proposed by @xcite , where worst - case estimates of the user rates resulted from no intercell interference coordination are used to calculate the qos requirements .",
    "this scheme can be cast into the proposed framework by restricting the candidate pattern to a single _ reuse_-1 pattern .",
    "fig.[fig_compare ] plots the network power consumption versus the rate requirement of the test points , where @xmath88 and @xmath102 test points are uniformly distributed within the network , and all test points are assumed to have the same requirement for simplicity .",
    "as shown , the network power consumption increases with the user rate requirement for both schemes , but the proposed scheme has a significantly power saving compared to the existing reuse-1 scheme . for example , to satisfy @xmath103mbit / s for 50 test points , the proposed scheme only consumes 200w , whereas the reuse-1 needs more than 1400w .",
    "moreover , the maximum rate requirement that the network can support has been greatly improved by the proposed scheme .",
    "we observe , for example , the maximum feasible rate in 50-test - point case increases from @xmath104mbit / s to @xmath105mbit / s by using the proposed scheme .",
    "the performance gains of the proposed strategy come from its ability to manage the interference by resource allocation and explicitly take into account the interference coupling caused by cell ( de)activation when estimating the user rate .",
    "in this appendix , the proof of proposition [ prop0 ] is provided . by letting @xmath106 ,",
