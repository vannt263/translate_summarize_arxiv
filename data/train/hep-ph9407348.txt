    "there is a growing interest in the hadronic content of the photon @xcite as both a test of qcd and as a background to precision measurements of electroweak parameters .",

    "a good determination of the quark content of the photon is therefore needed to test the various models of the photon structure functions and is essential for the extraction of the gluon content of the photon . in this paper",

    "the jet remnants will generally go down the beam so when considering backgrounds we can veto events with jets detected above some minimum angle .",
    "one sees that the crux of the analysis is to determine whether the signal is overwhelmed by backgrounds .    to illustrate the background contributions we take as an example @xmath0-quark production at a 500  gev @xmath2 collider where we have folded in the photon spectrum for the backscattered laser and use ( to be specific ) the duke and owens photon structure functions @xcite .",

    "@xmath33_\\gamma \\to e b\\bar{b}$ ] ( eqn .",
    "the pointlike process @xmath21 contains a collinear divergence arising from the internal @xmath0-quark line which is also included in the process @xmath34 .",
    "this divergence must therefore be first subtracted as described in ref .",
    "@xcite before including it as a background .",
    "likewise , the process @xmath33_\\gamma \\to e b\\bar{b}$ ] , _ i.e. _ , with the gluon coming from the hadronic structure of the photon , is similarly , to some approximation , contained in our resolved photon contribution _ via _ the altarelli - parisi evolution of the distribution functions .",
    "a similar collinear subtraction must be made if @xmath33_\\gamma \\to e b\\bar{b}$ ] is to be considered a correction to our result .",
    "we find that , after making the required collinear subtraction , both processes @xmath21 ( direct ) and @xmath23 ( once resolved ) contribute negligibly in the kinematic region under study .    in the remaining background discussions",
    "we are concerned with decay chains that might be mistaken for the signal . in particular , in the processes listed in eqns .",
    "( 3)-(10 ) heavy quarks are pair produced which could lead to the situation where the @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 ) decays semileptonically and only an electron is seen by the detector .",
    "clearly , this is expected to be rather unlikely given that all decay products , both leptonic and hadronic , are expected to be boosted in the same direction given the relatively large energy of the produced quarks .",
    "the likelihood of these events is further reduced given the small branching fractions for these decay chains .    keeping this in mind",
    "we start by describing the possible direct process backgrounds .",
    "the first two backgrounds are only relevant to the @xmath1 cases involving weiszcker - williams photons .",
    "the background @xmath37 is negligible compared to @xmath38 even though it is technically of lower order in coupling .",
    "this is because the @xmath0 and @xmath35 come out back - to - back with high @xmath39 and are therefore very distinct because the decay products of the @xmath35 are boosted along the @xmath35 direction making it very unlikely that the electron is seen in the detector while the hadronic remnants go down the beampipe .",
    "the second direct background , @xmath40 , will also turn out to be unimportant in the relevant kinematic region once the @xmath35 is allowed to decay and cuts are imposed so that only the @xmath41 and @xmath0 are observed .",
    "the third direct background , @xmath42 , can contribute in two ways .",
    "in the first , the beam electron is observed in the detector and the decay products of the @xmath35 are not , while in the second the beam electron goes down the beampipe but the electron from @xmath35 decay is seen in the detector . as discussed above ,",
    "the situation in which the beam electron is hard scattered into the detector is approximated by our signal and corrections to the signal , due to this process after subtracting the collinear divergence , are found to be negligible in this kinematic region ( this process was calculated numerically using helicity amplitude techniques ) .",
    "the other possibility , where the beam electron goes down the beampipe and is not seen in the detector , can be well described using the weiszcker - williams approximation and the subprocess @xmath43 ( the subprocess cross section can be extracted from , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the final direct process which could contaminate the signal is the charged current process , @xmath44 ref .  @xcite ; here the electron seen in the detector comes from the decay of the @xmath36 .",
    "we next consider the singly resolved backgrounds .",
    "as discussed above , if the beam electron is hard scattered into the detector , the first of the singly resolved backgrounds , @xmath45_\\gamma \\to e + b + \\bar{b}$ ] , ( again , we use helicity amplitude techniques to calculate this process numerically ) , is approximated by our signal ; corrections to our result in the appropriate kinematic region , after the necessary collinear subtraction has been made , are found to be negligible .",
    "it is also possible that the beam electron goes down the beam pipe , in which case this background can be well described in the weiszcker - williams approximation with the subprocess @xmath46 ( this cross section can also be extracted from ref .",
    "@xcite by carefully modifying couplings and color factors ) .",
    "also , the charged current process @xmath45_\\gamma \\to \\nu + b + \\bar{c}$ ] can also contribute to the background if the @xmath36 decays leptonically and the resulting electron is observed in the detector ; with some care , this subprocess can be extracted from ref .",
    "@xcite .    finally , we consider the doubly resolved backgrounds where the photon from the beam electron contributes a parton from it s hadronic structure . since the parton model of photon structure",
    "is defined for real photons only , it is appropriate to use the weiszcker - williams approximation , with the subprocesses @xmath47_\\gamma + [ g]_\\gamma \\to b + \\bar{b}$ ] and @xmath48_\\gamma + [ \\bar{q}]_\\gamma \\to b + \\bar{b}$ ] , to calculate these backgrounds ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the cross sections ) .",
    "the largest of the backgrounds are displayed in fig .",
    "the @xmath39 ( of the @xmath0 quark ) distributions of the two charged current processes have , as expected , rather long tails due to the large mass of the exchanged particle .",
    "these @xmath39 distributions are , however , several orders of magnitude smaller than our signal , and do not appear on our plot for the scale chosen .",
    "the remaining subprocesses fall off rapidly with @xmath39 of the @xmath0 quark ; although they may produce many events at small @xmath39 , they are safely negligible for @xmath49 . we did not include charge identification of the leptons since we include both @xmath0 and @xmath35 production in our distributions and estimates of event numbers as they both make equal contributions .",
    "this approach also eliminates the complexities of @xmath50 mixing in the analysis .",
    "having convinced the reader that the signal we are studying is distinct and clean of backgrounds we proceed to examine the sensitivity of various kinematic distributions to different structure function parameterizations for a number of collider possibilities .",
    "we consider a group of the existing sets of photonic parton distributions that appear in the literature , namely the set of duke and owen ( do ) @xcite , the set of drees and grassie ( dg )  @xcite , the set 1 of abramowicz , charchula and levy ( lac )  @xcite and the leading order set of glck , reya and vogt ( grv )  @xcite .",
    "we first considered the lep @xmath1 collider at cern upgraded in luminosity using the weizscker - williams photon distributions with the @xmath2 cross sections to obtain numerical results .",
    "the cross section for the signal is expected to be between 0.108  pb ( grv ) to 0.220  pb ( lac ) .",
    "an order of magnitude improvement in the lep luminosity , resulting in 1  @xmath51/year , would yield 108 - 220 @xmath0 s per year or of order 50 - 100 reconstructed @xmath0 s once efficiencies are included .",
    "this small number of events is unlikely to offer an improvement over existing estimates of the @xmath0 content of the photon . at the lep200",
    "@xmath1 collider the cross section is expected to be 0.047  pb ( grv ) to 0.092  pb ( lac ) which would yield roughly 40 @xmath0 s or 20 reconstructed @xmath0 s for the total integrated luminosity of 500  pb@xmath52 .",
    "clearly a higher energy and higher luminosity collider is needed .",
    "we therefore turn to the proposed higher energy nlc @xmath1 collider in both @xmath1 mode and @xmath2 mode with @xmath53=500  gev and very high luminosity yielding of order @xmath54  fb@xmath52/year . in the @xmath1 mode we fold in the weizscker - williams effective photon distribution and the @xmath2 mode we fold in the backscattered laser photon spectrum .",
    "first , consider the @xmath1 configuration .",
    "the cross section is expected to be between 14  fb ( grv ) and 24  fb ( lac ) . given 50  fb@xmath52/yr of luminosity , we expect 700 to 1200 events per year , and after the 50% @xmath0 reconstruction efficiency , of order 500 reconstructed @xmath0 s per year .",
    "this will allow a measurement of the @xmath0-quark distribution in the photon at some level , but even so , more events are desirable .",
    "the @xmath39 distribution of the @xmath0-quark is shown in fig .",
    "5a for various sets of photon distribution functions .",
    "lastly , consider a @xmath55  gev linear @xmath1 collider configured as an @xmath2 collider through the use of a backscattered laser .",
    "in this situation , we expect a cross section of between 68  fb ( grv ) and 138  fb ( lac ) , with all backgrounds smaller by at least 2 orders of magnitude after the implementation of the cuts described above .",
    "this gives a total of 3400 to 6900 events per year , and after the @xmath0 reconstruction efficiency , there will still be 2000 - 3000 events per year to analyze .",
    "the @xmath56 distribution for the signal is shown in fig .",
    "5b for various choices of photon distributions .",
    "having established that only the two cases involving an nlc can provide a useful measurement of the @xmath0-quark content of the photon ( _ i.e. _ , large enough signal combined with manageable backgrounds ) , we consider useful experimental measurements .    before proceeding we point out a subtlety that should be mentioned but that we will ignore .",
    "the subtlety is related to the fact that the parton model ( including the distribution function model of the hadronic structure of the photon ) implicitly assumes that the constituents are massless ( or , that the mass of the partons is small relative to all energy scales in the problem , and so can be safely ignored ) . as we are producing a massive @xmath0-quark ,",
    "the minimum @xmath57 is of order @xmath58 , and it is not necessarily possible to ignore the initial @xmath0-quark mass compared to all mass scales , namely @xmath59 . in practice",
    "it turns out that our results are only sensitive to a finite @xmath60 for two cases ; at the lower energy colliders where the statistics are insufficient to make a meaningful measurement and for the low @xmath3 region of @xmath61 distributions ( where , following the standard parton model notation , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the fraction of the electron s momentum carried by the photon , and @xmath3 is ( nominally ) the fraction of the photon s momentum carried by the @xmath0-quark ) . in the latter case",
    "the uncertainties are only in the lowest @xmath3 region where the statistical errors will still overwhelm the uncertainties in our definition of the scale .    in the figures that follow , only the estimated",
    "* statistical * uncertainties are included in the error bars , so that the error bars shown will slightly underestimate the actual errors .",
    "a physically measurable quantity is the ratio of the initial @xmath0-quark energy or momentum to the beam energy",
    ". this will generally be closely related to @xmath65 , and the conversion is easily calculated .",
    "we show , in fig .",
    "6a , the number of events _ vs. _",
    "@xmath66 for various photon distribution functions in the @xmath2 case .",
    "the largest differences in the models are in the lowest @xmath66 bins where the event numbers are largest . considering only the lowest @xmath66 bin and using the duke - owens results to estimate the error we obtain a statistical error of roughly 2.5% .",
    "thus , using only the lowest @xmath66 bin for the measurement , and the higher @xmath66 bins as a normalization , it will be quite easy to distinguish between the various distribution functions .",
    "6b shows the same distribution in the @xmath1 case . here , the conclusion is not so clear , due to relatively larger error bars , but it should be possible to distinguish between lac , do / dg and grv , though it may not be possible to distinguish do from dg",
    ".    finally we show , in fig .",
    "6a ( @xmath2 ) and in fig .",
    "6b ( @xmath1 ) the distribution of event numbers in @xmath3 .",
    "this distribution will be useful if one can tag the electron which provides the weizscker - williams photon ( allowing a complete reconstruction of the @xmath2 initial state , including @xmath64 ) , or in the @xmath2 case if one can deconvolute the @xmath66 distribution knowing the parton level cross section and the laser backscattered photon spectrum .",
    "as with the @xmath66 distribution , the large @xmath3 bins can be used to fix the normalization of the distribution while the lowest @xmath3 bin can be used to provide information on the @xmath0-quark distribution in the photon .",
    "similar conclusions can be reached here as well : in the @xmath2 case , it should be possible to distinguish between the various distribution functions , while in the @xmath67 case it should be possible to distinguish between lac , do / dg and grv ( though possibly not between do and dg ) .",
    "in this paper we proposed using high @xmath39 @xmath0-quarks as a means of determining the heavy quark content of the photon .",
    "we have shown that the process @xmath68 provides a clean method of extracting the quark content of the photon and can distinguish between the different models in the literature .",
    "the subprocess we examined was @xmath69 where the beam electron undergoes a hard scatter from a resolved @xmath0 in the photon , in essence rutherford scattering off a photon target .",
    "the signal for the process is quite distinct ; all backgrounds can be eliminated by insisting that only the scattered @xmath0-quark balanced against the beam electron be observed and imposing a minimum @xmath39 cut on the @xmath0 to eliminate the remaining direct and once resolved @xmath70 production .",
    "it is clear that this reaction will allow a good determination of the quark content of the photon . in the low @xmath3-regions of the distributions , where the models differ the most ,",
    "typical uncertainties are roughly 2.5% for the @xmath2 colliders .",
    "this is more than adequate to distinguish between different models . for the @xmath1 cases the statistics are poorer and do not offer quite as good a measurement , though valuable information can be extracted from these data .",
    "one could also use this approach to study the charmed quark content of the photon  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath71-quark content of the photon is roughly four times as large as the @xmath0-quark content due to the different quark electric charges .",
    "however , since charmed mesons are more difficult to reconstruct , the @xmath0-quark gives a cleaner signal .",
    "the process we have proposed is complementary to others that have been studied in the literature and can contribute to more precise determinations of quark and gluon distributions inside the photon .",
    "along with other processes considered elsewhere it is clear that an @xmath2 collider is an ideal facility for studying the hadronic content of the photon .",
