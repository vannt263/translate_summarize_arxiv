    "in neutrino - nucleon ( ) scattering , the ratio of neutral current ( @xmath11 exchange ) to charged current ( @xmath12 exchange ) cross - sections is related to the neutral current quark couplings by the llewellyn - smith formula @xcite : & & + & = & ( g_l^2+rg_r^2 ) , [ eqn : ls ] where r & & , [ eqn : rdef ] and @xmath13 , the isoscalar sum of the squared left or right - handed quark couplings .",
    "there are small corrections to this relation from higher - twist effects , isovector components to the nuclear target and electromagnetic radiative effects , and a substantial correction from massive quark effects , such as scattering from the strange or charm sea . because the neutral current quark couplings are functions of the weak mixing angle , @xmath14 , a measurement of  can be used to extract .",
    "electroweak radiative corrections introduce significant @xmath15 and @xmath16 dependences into these couplings . however , in the `` on - shell '' ( sirlin ) renormalization scheme where @xmath17 , the one - loop electroweak radiative corrections to the quark couplings cancel approximately in equation  [ eqn : ls ] @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if the quantity  is measured and used to extract a value of , the result will be almost equal to @xmath18 . given the very precise measurement of the @xmath11 mass from the lep experiments ,  scattering can , within the standard model , provide a precise measurement of @xmath19 at energies far below @xmath12 production threshold .",
    "outside the standard model , deviations between electroweak parameters measured in  scattering and other processes are sensitive to a host of new physics possibilities @xcite .",
    "possibilities discussed in this paper include new four - fermion contact interactions at high mass scales , leptoquarks and neutrino oscillations .",
    "discussed elsewhere in these proceedings is the possibility that  scattering may be sensitive to `` leptophobic '' @xmath20 bosons @xcite@xcite .",
    "the ccfr detector consists of an @xmath21  m long , @xmath22  ton target calorimeter with a mean density of @xmath23  g / cm@xmath6 , followed by an iron toroid spectrometer .",
    "the target calorimeter consists of 168 iron plates , @xmath25 m  @xmath26  @xmath25 m  @xmath26  @xmath27 cm each .",
    "the active elements are liquid scintillation counters spaced every two plates and drift chambers spaced every four plates . there are a total of 84 scintillation counters and 42 drift chambers in the target . the toroid spectrometer is not directly used in this analysis .",
    "the tevatron quadrupole triplet neutrino beam is created by decays of pions and kaons produced when @xmath28  gev protons hit a production target .",
    "a wide band of secondary energies is accepted by focusing magnets .",
    "the production target is located about @xmath29  km upstream of the neutrino detector .",
    "the production target and focusing train are followed by a @xmath30  km decay region .",
    "the beam is predominantly muon neutrinos and anti - neutrinos , but contains a small fraction of electron neutrinos ( @xmath31% ) and a negligible fraction of tau neutrinos ( less than @xmath32 ) which result primarily from @xmath33 decay .",
    "neutrinos are observed in the target calorimeter _ via _ their neutral current and charged current interactions .",
    "@xmath34 charged current events are characterized by the presence of a muon in the final state which deposits energy in a large number of consecutive scintillation counters as it travels through the calorimeter .",
    "neutral current events have no muon and deposit energy over a range of counters typical of a hadronic shower ( 5 to 20 counters ) .",
    "accordingly , we define `` short '' events as those which deposit energy over an interval of 30 or fewer scintillation counters . the ratio @xmath35 is defined to be the number of short events divided by the number of long events @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath36 as the energy deposited in the calorimeter in the first twenty counters following the event vertex .",
    "events were selected using a calorimeter trigger fully sensitive for @xmath36 above @xmath37  gev , and only events with @xmath36 above @xmath38  gev were used in the analysis . to ensure event containment , the fiducial volume of the detector",
    "is limited to a central cylindrical region 30  in radius and excludes events which began in the first 6 counters or the last 34 counters of the detector . the resulting data sample consisted of about 660,000 events .",
    "a detailed monte carlo was used to determine electroweak parameters from the measured @xmath35 .",
    "the only undetermined inputs to this monte carlo were the neutral current quark couplings which were then varied until the monte carlo predicted an @xmath35 which agreed with that observed in the data . for the extraction of , the couplings in the monte carlo were fixed to their standard model predictions as functions of  which was then varied as the only free parameter .",
    "the monte carlo included detector response and beam simulations , as well as a detailed cross - section model which included electromagnetic radiative corrections , isovector target corrections , heavy quark production and seas , the longitudinal cross - section and lepton mass effects .",
    ".uncertainties in the _ preliminary _ extraction of  from the ccfr data [ cols=\">,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there are three major uncertainties in the comparison of @xmath35 from the monte carlo to the data : the statistical error in the data , the uncertainty in the effective charm quark mass for charged current charm production , the uncertainty in the incident flux of @xmath39 s on the detector . other sources of systematic uncertainty",
    "were also investigated @xcite .",
    "table  [ errors ] shows the effect of the uncertainties on the determination of .",
    "the charm mass error comes from the uncertainty in modeling the turn - on of the charm quark production cross section .",
    "the monte carlo uses a slow - rescaling model with the parameters extracted using events with two oppositely charged muons in this experiment @xcite .",
    "this error dominates the calculation of @xmath35 at low @xmath40 ( and low @xmath36 ) where the threshold suppression is greatest .",
    "the @xmath39 flux uncertainty has a large effect on @xmath35 because almost all charged current @xmath39 events are short events .",
    "therefore , the relatively small ( @xmath41 @xcite ) fractional uncertainty in the @xmath39 flux is a large effect , particularly at high @xmath36 since most @xmath39 charged current interactions deposit the full incident neutrino energy into the calorimeter .",
    "this @xmath41 is dominated by a @xmath42 production uncertainty in the @xmath43 content of the secondary beam which produces @xmath44 of the @xmath39 flux .",
    "the bulk of the @xmath39 flux comes from @xmath45 decays , which are well - constrained by the observed @xmath34 spectrum from @xmath46 decays @xcite .",
    "=    ccfr has updated its previously published result @xcite with the addition of more data and an improved analysis of systematic errors .",
    "the new _ preliminary _ result from ccfr for the weak mixing angle in the on - shell renormalization scheme is : ^2_w=0.22130.0021(stat ) 0.0027(syst)0.0034(model ) .",
    "[ eqn : wmares ] the additional uncertainty on this on - shell  from @xmath47  gev due to the one - loop electroweak radiative corrections is @xmath48 . within the standard model , this corresponds to a @xmath12 mass of @xmath49   gev .",
    "it is possible to combine the world s  scattering data on isoscalar targets and obtain an average .",
    "however , because of the large charm production systematic which is common to all experiments , there is not much improvement . combining the five most precise experiments , @xmath50 , with a @xmath51dof of @xmath52 . shown in figure  [ fig : wmass ] is the good agreement of equivalent @xmath12 mass measurements from  experiments , direct measurements from the tevatron , and derivations from @xmath53 observables and @xmath54 .    =    to facilitate comparisons with extensions to the standard model , this result can also be expressed as a model - independent constraint on the neutral - current quark couplings .",
    "the _ preliminary _",
    "ccfr constraint is = 0.56290.0048=1.7266g_l^2 + 1.1198g_r^2 -0.1008_l^2 - 0.0865_r^2 [ eqn : coupcon ] where @xmath55 .",
    "the standard model prediction is @xmath56 for the measured values of @xmath57 , @xmath54 , @xmath58 .",
    "figure  [ fig : couplings ] shows this result compared with a fit to other neutrino data @xcite .",
    "the following sections make use of the value of @xmath59 given in equation  [ eqn : coupcon ] and its standard model value to set limits on new physics possibilities .",
    "one can postulate a four - fermion interaction between two neutrinos and two quarks , and add a term to the interaction lagrangian of the form @xmath60 .",
    "this interaction will shift the predicted values for the neutral current quark couplings , and thus the  data can limit the allowed range of @xmath61 . from the preliminary ccfr result , at 95% confidence , @xmath62  tev or @xmath63  tev .",
    "the model used for this search is an su(5)-inspired model @xcite .",
    "if there are no leptoquark - induced flavor - changing neutral currents and if the left - handed coupling of the leptoquark ( @xmath64 ) is much larger than its right - handed coupling ,  is one of the most sensitive probes . from the preliminary ccfr result , at 95% confidence , @xmath65  tev .",
    "=    neutrino oscillations , if present , would also affect the measured neutral current quark couplings .",
    "this is because charged - current events are selected by the presence of a muon in the final state , and clearly if muon neutrinos oscillate to either electron or tau neutrinos , they are less likely to produce final - state muons in their charged current interactions . details of this analysis can be found elsewhere @xcite ; the limits obtained are shown in figure  [ fig : osc ] .",
    "even in the era of high - luminosity colliders that produce copious on - shell @xmath12 and @xmath11 bosons , neutrino - nucleon deeply inelastic scattering remains an interesting system in which to pursue measurements of electroweak parameters . within the standard model ,",
    "the ccfr measurement of  from  scattering provides a measurement of the @xmath12 mass with comparable precision to current measurements at the tevatron . outside the standard model ,",
    "this measurement is sensitive to new physics at the tev scale and to neutrino oscillations",
    ".    the nutev experiment at fermilab will continue to improve the precision of measurements of  scattering .",
    "a new beamline , the sign - selected quadrupole train ( ssqt ) , will run from 1996 - 1998 and provide separate high - intensity neutrino and anti - neutrino beams , this will allow separate measurements of the neutrino and anti - neutrino neutral current cross - sections .",
    "the difference , @xmath66 , is insensitive to sea quark distributions , and will allow a measurement of  with model errors reduced by a factor of 3 .",
    "the ssqt also produces almost no electron neutrinos from @xmath43 decays , thus removing the dominant source of experimental uncertainty in the ccfr measurement .",
    "nutev projects a precision of @xmath67 in its measurement of  which corresponds within the standard model to a @xmath12 mass precision of @xmath68  mev .",
