    "newtonian gravity theory has served physics and technology faithfully for well over three centuries . nevertheless , it has long been known that it is only an approximation to a relativistic gravitation theory , usually identified with einstein s 1915 general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "gr has correctly predicted subtle effects in the dynamics of the solar system , in the celebrated hulse - taylor double pulsar , and has anticipated the existence of those exotic denizens of the universe , black holes , now confirmed by myriad observations of galactic nuclei , compact galactic x - ray sources , etc .",
    "the nonlinear aspects of gravitation in gr are crucial to these new settings : gravitation is more difficult than newton supposed . but up until a few decades ago astronomers took comfort in the belief that if one sidesteps situations with extremely strong gravitational fields , or with extremely rapid motions , then newtonian theory is a good approximation to the truth .",
    "but is that so ?",
    "consider the situation in the realm of galaxies .",
    "speeds are low compared to light s , and gravitational fields are weak there .",
    "so newtonian physics",
    "_ should _ describe motions extremely well . yet",
    "the accelerations of stars and gas clouds in the outskirts of spiral galaxies , and of galaxies swimming in the large clusters of galaxies , well exceed newtonian predictions made on the basis of the matter actually visible in these systems .",
    "those accelerations are inferred by combining doppler measured velocities with geometric assumptions , e.g. that in a particular spiral galaxy stars move in circles on a plane .",
    "the geometric assumptions can be checked , at least statistically , and the acceleration discrepancy is found to be real and generic . sometimes the problem is characterized thus : rotation or random velocities are much bigger than expected .",
    "i stress acceleration because it is the quantity which directly measures the strength of the gravitational field . in any case , what is wrong ?",
    "it was realized by ostriker and peebles  @xcite that massive halos would stabilize disk galaxies against the bar forming instabilities which , in newtonian theory , are endemic to systems with little velocity dispersion . since about third of the spiral galaxies have no significant bar , this justified the hypothesis that disk galaxies ( including spirals ) are often embedded in massive but invisible halos .",
    "thus started the trend to resolve the acceleration discrepancy by postulating the existence of much dark matter ( dm ) in systems ranging from the very tenuous dwarf spheroidal galaxies with visible masses @xmath1 to the great clusters of galaxies with observed masses in the @xmath2 ballpark  @xcite , in brief in any system where an acceleration discrepancy exists .",
    "the dm s role is to provide the missing gravitational pull to account for the excessive accelerations ( an easy introduction to the dm paradigm is provided by khalil and mu~ noz  @xcite ) .",
    "but thirty years of astronomical exploration and laboratory experiments  @xcite have yet to provide independent evidence of dm s existence , e.g. @xmath3 rays from its decay .",
    "is there an alternative to dm ?",
    "this review focuses on the modified newtonian dynamics scheme put forward by milgrom  @xcite as an alternative to the systematic appeal to dm .",
    "to pass judgment on dm and alternatives to it , it is well to take stock of the two overarching empirical facts in the phenomenology of disk galaxies .",
    "first , ever since the work of bosma as well as rubin and coworkers  @xcite , it has been clear that gas clouds in the disks of spiral galaxies , which serve as tracers of the gravitational potential , circle around each galaxy s center with a ( linear ) velocity which first rises as one moves out of the center , but hardly drops as the radius grows to well beyond the visible disk s edge .",
    "yet a falloff of the velocity with radius was naively expected because , to judge from the light distribution in spiral galaxies , most of their visible mass is rather centrally concentrated .",
    "newtonian gravitation would thus predict that `` rotation curves '' ( rc ) should drop as @xmath4 outside the bright parts of these galaxies , but this is not seen in over a hundred extended rcs measured with sufficient precision  @xcite .",
    "in fact in many spiral galaxies , particularly those possessing high surface brightness , the extended rc becomes flat away from the central parts ( fig .",
    "[ figure : fig1 ] ) .     is plotted vs galactocentric radius @xmath5 in kiloparsecs ( kpc ) ; 1 kpc @xmath6 3000 light years .",
    "it is seen that the rcs are flat to well beyond the edges of the optical disks ( @xmath7 kpc ) .",
    "graph from ref .  , reprinted with permission from the annual review of astronomy and astrophysics , volume 39 ( c)2001 by annual reviews www.annualreviews.org,width=264 ]    second , as originally pointed out by tully and fisher ( tf )  @xcite , the rotation velocity @xmath8 and the blue band luminosity @xmath9 of a galaxy",
    "are simply correlated ( fig .",
    "[ figure : fig2 ] ) . in a more informative form",
    "@xcite , the tf law states that for disk galaxies the luminosity in the near infrared band , @xmath10 ( a good tracer of stellar mass ) , is proportional to the fourth power of the rotation velocity in the flat part of the rc , with a universal proportionality constant .     in units of @xmath11 vs. the asymptotic rotational velocity @xmath8 in km / s .",
    "the straight line ( mine ) has slope exactly 4 and corresponds to mond s prediction , eq .",

    "graph reproduced from ref .   by permission of the american astronomical society.,width=226 ]    the flat extended rc s have provided the logic underpinning the dm paradigm as follows . in the flat part of a rc ,",
    "the rotation velocity is @xmath15 independent , so the centripetal acceleration goes as @xmath16 .",
    "thus in the plane of the galaxy the gravitational field must be decreasing as @xmath16 . according to poisson s equation of newtonian theory , such a gravitational field , if assumed spherically symmetric ,",
    "must be sourced by a mass distribution with @xmath17 profile ( isothermal sphere model ) . since the visible mass density ( in stars and gas ) in the inner disk drops much faster than this , it is consistent to assume that the total mass distribution in the outer parts is quasispherical .",
    "the conclusion is that each spiral galaxy must be immersed in a roundish dm halo with mass density profile tending , at large @xmath15 , to @xmath17 .",
    "but questions plague the halo hypothesis .",
    "the halo dm , though much searched for , has never been detected directly  @xcite .",
    "cosmogonic simulations of dm halo formation within newtonian physics predict that such a halo would have a density profile behaving like @xmath16 for small @xmath15 and gradually steepening to @xmath18 asymptotically . only by fine tuning the halo s parameters",
    "is it feasible to match this kind of profile to the observed flat rcs as well as would the isothermal sphere ( the need to fine tune parameters of a halo model in order to fit the shape of the galaxy s rc was already clear long ago  @xcite ) . and the predicted @xmath16 `` cusp '' in the density profile is also observationally problematic  @xcite .",
    "the dm halo hypothesis is evidently an attempt to resolve the acceleration discrepancy within orthodox gravitation theory .",
    "but in the coming to terms with this discrepancy , suspicion fell on newtonian gravity already early in the game .",
    "zwicky , who had exposed the acceleration discrepancy in clusters of galaxies  @xcite , opined much later that the discrepancy may reflect a failure of conventional physics  @xcite .",
    "concrete proposals for departures from the newtonian inverse square law in various settings were put forward by a number of workers  @xcite .",
    "all of these still regarded gravitation as a linear interaction with the strength of the field proportional to its source s mass .",
    "as milgrom realized  @xcite , such a modification of the gravity law , if relevant on the scales of galaxies , is incompatible with the tf law . for one",
    "it would imply that a mass @xmath19 at @xmath20 generates at @xmath21 the acceleration field @xmath22 , with @xmath23 depending only on fundamental constants and on the relative positions of source and field points in accordance with the principle of homogeneity of space .",
    "then , obviously , for matter orbiting with speed @xmath8 at radius @xmath5 in the outskirts of a galaxy ( with its source mass , @xmath24 , concentrated at a fairly definite distance @xmath5 ) , the acceleration , @xmath25 should be equal to @xmath26 .",
    "this would require not only @xmath27 , but also @xmath28 , the last incompatible with the tf law .",
    "then again @xmath29 with the correct dimensions , @xmath30 , can not be built by using only @xmath31 and the scale of length @xmath32 at which gravity departs from newtonian form . and inclusion of mass in the construction ( presumably the source s mass ) would be against the spirit of linearity .",
    "the bottom line is that linear gravity , even if non - newtonian , is incompatible with the tf law .",
    "milgrom  @xcite proposed a novel paradigm which can be interpreted as reflecting non - newtonian as well as nonlinear character of gravity already at the nonrelativistic level .",
    "he called the scheme modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) .",
    "the essential part of it is the relation @xmath33 between the acceleration @xmath34 of a particle and the ambient conventional newtonian gravitational field @xmath35 .",
    "if the function @xmath36 were unity , this would be usual newtonian dynamics .",
    "milgrom assumes that the positive smooth monotonic function @xmath36 approximately equals its argument when this is small compared to unity ( deep mond limit ) , but tends to unity when that argument is large compared to unity ( fig .",
    "[ figure : fig3 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath37 is a natural constant , approximately equal to @xmath38 .",
    "it is a fact that the centripetal accelerations of stars and gas clouds in the outskirts of spiral galaxies tend to be below @xmath37 .",
    "function : the `` simple '' function @xmath39 ( solid ) and the `` standard '' function @xmath40 ( dotted).,width=226 ]    how does the mond formula  ( [ mond ] ) help ?",
    "consider again stars or gas clouds orbiting in the disk of a spiral galaxy ( mass @xmath24 ) with speed @xmath41 at radius @xmath15 from its center .",
    "we must identify @xmath42 with the centripetal acceleration @xmath43 . sufficiently outside the main mass distribution we may estimate @xmath44 . and at sufficiently large @xmath15 , @xmath42 will drop below @xmath37 and we shall be able to approximate @xmath45 . putting all this together",
    "gives @xmath46 from which we may conclude two things .",
    "first , @xmath41 well outside the main mass distribution becomes independent of @xmath15 , that is , the rc flattens at some value @xmath47 .",
    "second , from the coefficients follows @xmath48 introducing the ratio of mass to luminosity @xmath49 , @xmath50 , we have the added prediction @xmath51 . although @xmath50 in the blue band varies somewhat with galaxy color , this last results explains the tf law , fig .",
    "[ figure : fig2 ] .",
    "theoretically @xmath50 is much less variable in the near infrared ( k ) band  @xcite , which accounts for the extra sharpness of the tf relation in that band ( see fig .  2 in ref .  ) .     in units of the solar mass @xmath12 vs. the observed asymptotic rotational velocity @xmath47 in",

    "graph reproduced from ref .   by permission of the american astronomical society.,width=226 ]    the impressive agreement of eq .",
    "( [ tflaw ] ) with observations is most clear from the baryonic tf law  @xcite , fig .",
    "[ figure : fig4 ] . in full agreement with mond ,",
    "the observed baryonic mass in spiral galaxies is accurately proportional to the fourth power of the asymptotic rotation velocity .",
    "mond s single formula thus unifies the two overarching facts of spiral galaxy phenomenology .",
    "mond is similarly successful in explaining the detailed _ shapes _ of rcs .",
    "[ figure : fig5 ] shows the measured rcs of fifteen galaxies together with the mond fits based on surface photometry in the optical band and radio measurements .",
    "the only parameter adjusted in these impressive fits is the disk s stellar mass , or equivalently , the stellar mass - to - luminosity ratio @xmath50 .",
    "the trend of the so determined values of @xmath50 with galaxy color jibes with that predicted by stellar evolutionary models  @xcite ; in this mond does better than dm halo models  @xcite . to make similarly successful fits without just `` putting dm where it is needed '' ,",
    "dm theorists must adjust two extra parameters apart from @xmath50 in standardized halo models . as stressed in a recent critical reappraisal  @xcite",
    ", those galaxies where one - parameter mond fits do worse than halo fits often display complicating factors that could mitigate its less than striking performance . in disk galaxies",
    "mond is unquestionably more economical , and thus more falsifiable , than the dm paradigm .",
    "when applied to many galaxies , the mond fits mentioned serve to determine @xmath37 with some accuracy ; the value @xmath52 is often used  @xcite .",
    "it is significant that @xmath37 as deduced from rc fits agrees well with the value for @xmath37 obtained by comparing @xmath53 with the empirical coefficient in the tf law : the roles of @xmath37 are different in the two subjects , and they are tied together only in mond .",
    "milgrom  @xcite notes a few additional conceptually distinct roles played by @xmath37 in extragalactic astrophysics .",
    "an early example is that @xmath37 sets a special scale of mass surface density @xmath54 , and wherever in a system the actual surface mass density drops below @xmath55 , newtonian gravitational behavior gives way to mond dynamics  @xcite .",
    "( in galaxies like ours this occurs some way out in the disk , and that is why the rc may exhibit a brief drop before becoming flat asymptotically ) . on this basis milgrom",
    "predicted that were disk galaxies with surface mass density everywhere below @xmath55 to exist , they should show especially large acceleration discrepancies .",
    "a population of such galaxies became known in the late 1980 s  @xcite , and all facets of milgrom s prediction were subsequently confirmed  @xcite .",
    "mond obviously predicts that in these so called low surface brightness galaxies , the shapes of the rcs , which tend to be _ rising _ throughout the visible disk , should be independent of the precise way @xmath56 switches from @xmath57 to unity for @xmath58",
    ".    constraints of space forbid me from delving into other mond successes , e.g. for elliptical and dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "but excellent reviews of these and other phenomenological aspects of mond exist  @xcite .",
    "it is well , however , to stress one prominent empirical difficulty faced by the mond formula  ( [ mond ] ) .",
    "clusters of galaxies exist which comprise hundreds of galaxies of various kinds moving in their joint gravitational field with velocities of up to @xmath59 . the newtonian virial theorem ( gravitational potential energy of a quiescent system equals minus twice its kinetic energy )",
    "can be used to estimate a cluster s mass since the kinetic term is proportional to the total mass while the potential one goes like the square of mass . in this way",
    "it is determined that the total gravitating mass in a typical cluster is 5 - 10 times the mass actually seen in galaxies as well as in hot x - ray emitting gas , an oft constituent of clusters .",
    "a similar story is told by analyses of the hydrostatics of the hot gas in light of its measured temperature .",
    "finally , the gravitational lensing by several clusters has led to estimates of their masses commensurate with the mentioned diagnosis .",
    "when the mond formula , or even better , a mond analog to the virial theorem  @xcite , is used to estimate the masses of clusters , one finds an improvement but not a full resolution to the acceleration discrepancy .",
    "clusters still seem to contain a factor of two more matter than actually observed in all known forms  @xcite .",
    "the optimist will stress that mond has alleviated the discrepancy without even once overcorrecting for it ; the pessimist  @xcite will view this finding as damaging mond s credibility .",
    "but one should keep in mind that clusters may contain much invisible matter of rather prosaic nature , either baryons in a form which is hard to detect optically , or massive neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "however , the option that clusters contain non - baryonic cold dm between the galaxies , while logically possible , seems hardly justifiable in view of mond s overall philosophy .",
    "what is the physical basis of mond s success in unifying a lot of extragalactic data ?",
    "there are certain things the mond formula can not be .",
    "first , it is unlikely to be just a recipe for the way dm is distributed spatially in astronomical objects , as sometimes proposed  @xcite .",
    "such proposals strive to explain how the scale @xmath37 enters into spiral galaxy properties through some regularity in the cosmogony of dm halos .",
    "but strong arguments exists against an intrinsic scale of the halos  @xcite . and",
    "it is hard to see how such an explanation could give an account of the multiple roles of @xmath37 in different systems  @xcite .",
    "the mond formula , conceived as _ exact _ , can not be a generic modification of the inertia aspect of newton s second law @xmath60 ( here @xmath61 is the sum of _ all _ forces acting on the particle including the newtonian gravity force ) , an alternative proposed originally by milgrom  @xcite ( see a latter elaboration in ref .  ) . to see why consider a binary system with unequal masses @xmath19 and @xmath62 evolving under mutual gravity alone .",
    "the time derivative of @xmath63 , as calculated from eq .",
    "( [ mond ] ) , does not vanish in general if at least one of the accelerations is comparable to or smaller than @xmath37 , since the @xmath36 s will generally not be equal .",
    "so in the proposed interpretation , the mond formula does not conserve momentum . by the same token",
    "it does not conserve angular momentum , nor energy .",
    "milgrom sidesteps the problem by stipulating that the mond formula is only valid for test particles moving on a given background , e.g. , stars moving in the collective gravitational field of a galaxy .",
    "we may inquire more generally , does the mond formula , or some closely related one , represent a modification of inertia in test particle motion ? to comply with the conservation laws we likely want the formula to arise from a lagrangian .",
    "the kinetic part of the lagrangian should give us the @xmath64 part with whatever `` corrections '' are required .",
    "however , it is a theorem that no mond - like dynamics exists that simultaneously has a newtonian limit for @xmath65 ( all accelerations are large ) , is galilei invariant , and is derivable from a _ local _",
    "action  @xcite .",
    "( `` local '' means that the relevant lagrangian can be written as a single integral over volume . )",
    "this prohibition is even more stringent from a relativistic standpoint  @xcite .",
    "accordingly milgrom introduced a _ nonlocal _",
    "action , i.e. one which is a functional of complete orbits , but can not be reduced to an integral over a lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "this approach does not quite reproduce formula  ( [ mond ] ) generically , but that formula is recovered for the special case of circular orbits .    of course circular stellar orbits _ a la _ mond is really all that one needs to analyze data on spiral galaxies .",
    "however , it is known that elliptical galaxies comprise highly radial stellar orbits too , yet elliptical galaxies also seem to be well described by mond  @xcite , and so the nonlocal modified inertia approach might be found wanting here . on",
    "the plus side one may mention the pioneer anomaly  @xcite .",
    "the pioneer 10 and pioneer 11 spacecraft , as they travelled almost radially in the outer parts of the solar system , were found to be subject to an anomalous sunward acceleration of order @xmath66 ( not far from @xmath37 ) which does not fall off measurably with distance from the sun .",
    "were such an acceleration to reflect a generic gravitational field , it would have affected the outer planet ephemerides to an intolerable extent  @xcite .",
    "( an ephemerides is the calculated position of a celestial body as a function of time , past or future . ) by contrast , milgrom s nonlocal theory does predict different modifications of newtonian dynamics for radial ( pioneer ) and circular ( planetary ) orbits , though details have yet to be worked out  @xcite .",
    "milgrom has also speculated  @xcite that modified inertia may have its origin in an effective interaction of bodies with the vacuum .",
    "this is motivated by the well known fact that an object swimming through a fluid has its inertial mass increased by interacting with fluid degrees of freedom .",
    "of course , by local lorentz invariance inertial motion through the vacuum is possible as usual .",
    "however , accelerated motion is distinguished from inertial motion ( even before we come to inertia ) by the perception that the accelerated system is immersed in a thermal bath whose temperature is proportional to the acceleration ( unruh radiation  @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , milgrom suggests that accelerated motion with respect to the vacuum may shape the inertial characteristics of objects in a way compatible with mond . an alternative speculation",
    "@xcite is that mond style modified inertia and its particular scale @xmath37 may be generated by a symmetry in a higher dimensional spacetime , just as we think of ordinary ( newtonian or einstenian ) inertia as reflecting lorentz symmetry in minkowski spacetime . in one implementation of this program , with the extremely symmetric desitter spacetime playing the role of the embedding spacetime , a relation between the cosmological constant and @xmath37 surfaces , which is actually approximately satisfied if the observed acceleration of the hubble expansion is interpreted as reflecting a nonzero cosmological constant .",
    "what if , instead of the modified inertia interpretation , we follow milgrom s alternative proposal  @xcite to regard mond as a modification of newtonian gravity ? this entails a change in the r.h.s . of @xmath60 , with the new gravitational force possibly depending nonlinearly on its sources",
    "can such implementation be protected from violation of the conservation laws ?",
    "an affirmative answer to this query is readily available by starting from a modification of the lagrangian of newtonian gravity with milgrom s @xmath37 playing the role of characteristic scale , to wit @xmath67d^3x .",
    "\\label{lagrangian}\\ ] ] here @xmath68 is some positive function , @xmath69 is the matter s mass density and @xmath70 , the field in the theory , is to be identified with the gravitational potential that drives motion , i.e. @xmath71 . the lagrangian s kinetic part is the most general one that depends only on first derivatives of @xmath70 , and is consistent with the isotropy of space ( only @xmath72 appears ) .",
    "this aquadratic lagrangian theory ( aqual )  @xcite reduces to newton s in the limit @xmath73 , when it readily leads to poisson s equation for @xmath70 .",
    "more generically it yields the equation @xmath74&=&4\\pi g\\rho , \\label{aqual } \\\\ \\mu(\\surd x ) & \\equiv & f'(x ) .",
    "\\label{f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one identifies the @xmath36 function here with mond s @xmath36 .",
    "comparison of the aqual equation  ( [ aqual ] ) with poisson s for the same @xmath69 shows that @xmath75 where @xmath76 is some calculable vector field .",
    "now in highly symmetric situations ( spherical , cylindrical or plane symmetry ) , use of gauss theorem with the aqual equation shows that @xmath77 has to vanish . in light of the relation @xmath78 ,",
    "aqual then reproduces the mond formula  ( [ mond ] ) exactly .",
    "however , the curl term does not usually vanish in situations with lower symmetry ( milgrom and brada exhibit a curious exception  @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that the mond formula is generically an approximation to the solution of the aqual equation .",
    "how good an approximation ?",
    "work by milgrom and brada  @xcite has shown that often the curl is just a 5 - 10% correction .",
    "this explains how the mond formula manages to be so successful while not constituting by itself a physically consistent theory .",
    "now almost all mond fits to observed rcs are calculated using that formula exclusively .",
    "it should thus be clear that modest departures of empirical rcs from mond s predictions do not constitute evidence against the paradigm .",
    "the era of rc modeling with the full aqual eq .",
    "( [ aqual ] ) is still in its early stages  @xcite .",
    "i mentioned in sec .  4 that the mond formula is inconsistent with the conservation laws .",
    "the aqual theory is free of this problem .",
    "this needs no special proof ( although explicit proofs exist  @xcite ) : a theory based on a lagrangian which does _ not _ depend _ explicitly _ on coordinates , directions and time ( all true for aqual s lagrangian ) automatically conserves momentum , angular momentum and energy . at the level of the first integral ( [ integral ] ) of the aqual equation , it is the curl term which protects aqual gravity from violating the conservation laws .",
    "aqual consistently embodies the weak equivalence principle ( all bodies , regardless of inner structure , and starting from the same initial conditions , follow the same path in a gravitational field ) .",
    "as remarked by milgrom  @xcite , the mond formula is ambiguous in this respect . in a star accelerations of individual ions",
    "greatly exceed @xmath37 in magnitude .",
    "thus for each ion @xmath36 should be very close to unity , and we would guess that @xmath79 for the star as a whole . accordingly ,",
    "if regarded as a collection of ions , the star would follow a newtonian orbit in the galaxy s field .",
    "this conclusion is entirely at variance with the evidence from the flat rcs , or from the dictate of the mond formula when applied to the star regarded as structureless .",
    "aqual predicts that the center of mass ( cm ) of a collection of particles , no matter what the internal gravitational field , will follow the orbit determined by @xmath80 with @xmath70 the external potential coming from the aqual equation  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned , this acceleration will approximate that predicted by the mond equation .",
    "aqual does indeed supply a physical basis for mond .",
    "a system with sub-@xmath37 internal gravitational field immersed in an external field @xmath81 is predicted by aqual to exhibit quasi - newtonian internal dynamics  @xcite .",
    "originally milgrom conjectured this `` external field effect '' to explain why no acceleration discrepancy is evident in the loose open star clusters residing in the milky way  @xcite : the galaxy s field , still stronger than @xmath37 in its inner parts , suppresses the mond behavior expected in light of the weak internal fields . by contrast , if the said system is immersed in an external field @xmath82 , which is , however , _",
    "stronger _ than its internal fields , the internal dynamics is predicted to be quasi - newtonian , but with the effective gravitational constant @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "a useful product of aqual is a formula for the force between two masses in motion about each other , e.g. a binary galaxy .",
    "the mond formula can not be used directly here because , as mentioned in sec .",
    "4 , it would suggest that the binary s center of mass should accelerate ( nonconservation of momentum ) . instead , @xmath70 has to be computed from the aqual equation , and",
    "then @xmath84 has to be integrated over one galaxy s volume to obtain the force on it , as effectively done by milgrom  @xcite . for point masses @xmath19 and @xmath62 separated by distance @xmath15 , the force is @xmath85 with @xmath86^{1/2}$ ] ; milgrom gives the graph of @xmath87 . in the newtonian limit ( @xmath88 ) , @xmath89 . in the deep mond limit ( @xmath90 )",
    ", milgrom  @xcite shows analytically that the force is @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "this is most elegantly computed by exploiting the discovery that in that limit the aqual equation is conformally invariant , an approach that also yields the exact virial relation in the deep mond regime  @xcite .",
    "aqual permits a study of galaxy disc stability in the mond paradigm .",
    "i mentioned in sec .",
    "i that newtonian disk instabilities motivated the idea that dm halos surround disk galaxies . in the mond paradigm",
    "there is not dm , so how do a fraction of the spiral galaxies in the sky avoid forming bars ? using a mixture of mond formula and aqual equation arguments , milgrom  @xcite showed analytically that mond enhances local stability of disks against perturbations as compared to the newtonian situation .",
    "brada and milgrom  @xcite combined an @xmath92-body code with a numerical solver for the aqual equation to verify this and to demonstrate that mond enhances global stability .",
    "both works conclude that the degree of stabilization saturates in the deep mond regime ; this means no disk in mond is absolutely stable .",
    "christodoulou  @xcite and griv and zhytnikov  @xcite reach similar conclusions with @xmath92-body simulations based on just the mond formula .",
    "recently tiret and combes  @xcite studied _ evolution _ of bars in spiral disks using @xmath92-body simulations built on the aqual equation .",
    "they find that bars actually form more rapidly in mond than in dm halo newtonian models , but that mond bars then weaken as compared to those in newtonian models .",
    "the long term distribution of bar strengths predicted by mond is in better agreement with the observed distribution than that obtained from newtonian halo models .",
    "aqual is also important for studies of two - body relaxation in stellar systems .",
    "two - body relaxation is the process whereby distant gravitational encounters of pairs of stars in a galaxy or a cluster redistribute the system s energy and help it to approach some sort of equilibrium .",
    "in newtonian theory two - body relaxation is excruciatingly slow . but",
    "as binney and ciotti show  @xcite , two - body relaxation in the framework of aqual proceeds faster . in fact , if the system is deep in the mond regime , the speedup factor is the square of the acceleration discrepancy .",
    "a related effect is dynamical friction , whereby a massive object moving through a collection of lighter bodies , e.g. a globular star cluster coursing among the stars of its mother galaxy , loses energy by virtue of its kicking the background objects gravitationally as it sweeps by them . as a result the heavy object settles in the gravitational well confining it . in aqual for systems deep in the mond regime , dynamical friction",
    "is speeded up over the newtonian value by one power of the acceleration discrepancy  @xcite .    both of the above phenomena open a new window onto the mond - newtonian gravity dichotomy .",
    "_ suppose _ aqual is the correct nonrelativistic description of gravity .",
    "in regard to rcs of spiral galaxies , newtonian theory with dm could be `` saved '' by imagining the dm in each galaxy to be distributed in just such a way that the resulting total @xmath93 is just the @xmath70 generated in aqual theory by the baryonic ( visible ) matter .",
    "admittedly , the required dm distribution might be peculiar ( negative density somewhere  @xcite , or incompatible with cosmogonic simulations ) . but leaving these options aside , observational uncertainties might make it difficult to tell the two theories apart , as recent fits of rcs of nearby galaxies based on high quality data testify  @xcite",
    ". yet consideration of the mentioned dissipative effects might remove the effective degeneracy between the two models of a galaxy offered by the two theories .    in view of the generic prediction of newtonian cosmogonic simulations that the dm distribution in a galaxy rises to a cusp at the center ( see sec .",
    "i ) , newtonian dynamical friction should have caused the globular clusters of many a dwarf spheroidal galaxy to already have merged at its center and there lost their integrity  @xcite . while globular clusters are indeed absent from several such dwarf companions of the milky way , e.g. draco , sextans and carina  @xcite , the fornax dwarf spheroidal has five globular clusters near , but _ not at _ , its center .",
    "goerdt , moore , et al .",
    "@xcite regard this as showing that the dm near the core of fornax has a flat density profile , in contradiction to the dm simulations .",
    "in fact , there is other growing evidence negating dm density cusps  @xcite .",
    "now , some of the dwarf spheroidal satellites of the galaxy including fornax are in the deep mond regime . following binney and ciotti  @xcite , snchez - salcedo , reyes - iturbide and hernandez  @xcite point out that the mentioned speedup of settling by dynamical friction in aqual should long ago have caused the globular clusters in fornax to amalgamate at its center .",
    "aqual thus has a problem explaining the observations of fornax ; however , as we see the dm alternative has its problems too .",
    "can mond give a picture of the late stages of galaxy formation ?",
    "a step in this direction was taken by nipoti , londrillo and ciotti  @xcite on the basis their earlier work with @xmath92-body codes incorporating the full aqual equation  @xcite .",
    "they simulate the dissipationless collapse of a cloud of particles which ends up in the mond or deep mond regimes .",
    "they note that phase mixing ( the disappearance of structure in the initial conditions due to commingling of particle orbits ) proceeds slower than in the counterpart newtonian simulations , and that the final velocity distribution is anisotropic and favors radial orbits .",
    "current thought in cosmogony is that elliptical and spheroidal galaxies are the outcome of anisotropic collapse _ after _",
    "star formation is complete .",
    "nipoti et al .",
    "note that the end - products of some of their simulations resemble , in their surface density and velocity dispersion profiles , the dwarf - elliptical and dwarf - spheroidal galaxies in the sky .",
    "but other final states have trouble fitting in all the accepted empirical correlations between luminosity , radius and velocity dispersion of elliptical galaxies .",
    "why is a relativistic version of mond important ?",
    "although most astronomical systems with significant acceleration discrepancy are nonrelativistic in the extreme , there are two important exceptions .",
    "cosmology , which is important in itself and as a framework for the process of galaxy formation , is widely regarded as requiring the presence of much dm on the largest scales , and cosmology is universally believed to require relativistic treatment .",
    "gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters of galaxies has become a salient astronomical tool in the last two decades , and , since it discloses acceleration discrepancies , it is commonly regarded as supporting the need for dm . since light propagates with speed @xmath94 , nonrelativistic mond can not even begin to formulate the problem of gravitational lensing .",
    "the above cases drove the relativistic formulation of aqual  @xcite , which i shall refer to as raqual .",
    "raqual retains einstein s equations of gr as a tool for deriving the spacetime metric @xmath95 from the energy - momentum tensor of the matter ( one of whose components represents matter density ) .",
    "raqual further stipulates that matter and radiation play out their dynamics , not in the arena of @xmath95 , but in that of @xmath96 , where @xmath97 denotes a scalar field with dimensions of squared velocity .",
    "since all matter is treated alike in this respect , the exquisitely tested weak equivalence principle is safeguarded , but since the metric governing gravitational field dynamics is different from the one experienced by matter , the strong equivalence principle fails .",
    "this is essential , for otherwise we should end up back with gr as the relativistic gravity theory , and gr in the nonrelativistic limit leads to newtonian theory , not to mond .",
    "how is @xmath97 determined in raqual ?",
    "one takes the lagrangian for @xmath97 to be the covariant version of that for @xmath70 in aqual , eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "this means replacing @xmath98 as well as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the determinant of the matrix of components of @xmath95 .",
    "but in raqual one does not include a term in lieu of @xmath101 ; the coupling between @xmath97 and matter , which is to provide the source of the equation for @xmath97 in accordance with its lagrangian , is automatically generated by the @xmath102 factor in the metric @xmath103 with which we built the _ matter _",
    "s lagrangian . for time",
    "independent situations with nonrelativistic matter sources , the @xmath97 equation reduces to eq .",
    "( [ aqual ] ) with @xmath104 .",
    "however , it would be a mistake to conclude that in raqual @xmath97 is the gravitational potential .    in gr for weak gravity and nonrelativistic motion ,",
    "the potential in which matter moves , @xmath93 , is related to the metric by @xmath105 ( @xmath106 is the time coordinate ) . because , in this linearized theory , the most relevant einstein equation reduces to poisson s , @xmath93 coincides with the usual newtonian potential . in raqual",
    "@xmath95 still satisfies einstein - like equations , so the above relation applies as well .",
    "but the stipulation that matter s dynamics go forward in the metric @xmath103 determines the nonrelativistic potential in which matter moves , now called @xmath70 , to be @xmath107 .",
    "writing in linearized theory @xmath108 , we have @xmath109 .",
    "now to first approximation @xmath110 ; thus to leading order @xmath111 consequently , in raqual the gravitational potential traced by the matter s motions is the sum of the newtonian potential and the aqual scalar field , both generated by the same baryonic matter .",
    "the @xmath97 does the job of the dm s potential in conventional approaches , but its source is ordinary matter .    let us compare raqual with the successful aqual .",
    "we take the @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ aqual ] ) with @xmath104 to be approximately equal to its argument for @xmath112 , and to level off at a value @xmath113 when @xmath114 . then for strong @xmath115 poisson s equations gives @xmath116 so that the true potential is @xmath117 .",
    "this means gravity is newtonian with effective gravitational constant @xmath118 . for @xmath112 , the raqual equation",
    "tells us that @xmath119 is much stronger than @xmath120 .",
    "consequently , by eq .",
    "( [ sum ] ) , @xmath121 so that in the weak field regime raqual s gravitational field is close to aqual s .",
    "thus in raqual we have a relativistic theory which in the nonrelativistic limit inherits the good traits of mond by way of aqual .    however , on the relativistic front raqual hit two roadblocks . already the original paper  @xcite remarks that perturbations of @xmath97 from a static background for which @xmath112 , e.g. @xmath97 waves travelling in the reaches of a galaxy , propagate superluminally , i.e. , outside the light cone of @xmath103 .",
    "nowadays one hears the view that superluminality by itself is not sufficient reason for causal problems  @xcite .",
    "this is by no means the standard view , and so the specter of acausality motivated disillusionment with raqual  @xcite , and formulation of a two - scalar field theory , phase - coupled gravity ( pcg )  @xcite intended to prevent superluminality . in the pcg",
    "lagrangian the new scalar @xmath122 contributes a quadratic kinetic part , just as does @xmath97 ; there is also a simple coupling between @xmath122 and the kinetic term for @xmath97 which gives the theory its mond character .",
    "although pcg generates an intolerable drift of the kepler constant @xmath123 in the solar system , and marginally contradicts the observed precession of mercury s perihelion  @xcite , the theory has merits for both galaxy dynamics and cosmology  @xcite .",
    "however it may be , raqual and pcg were both finally disqualified as consistent representations of gravity by their inability to cope with observations of gravitational lenses .    discovered in 1979 , gravitational lenses have been intensively studied ever since . in strong gravitational lensing a cluster of galaxies ( but sometimes a single galaxy ) forms a few images of a single quasar in the background by bending the incoming light rays with its gravitational field .",
    "this provided a novel tool for determination of masses of large astronomical systems by an elementary use of gr . by the late 1980 s it was apparent that masses of clusters so determined were larger than the observed baryonic mass in them , and commensurate with the masses determined from motions of the galaxies comprising them .",
    "the novelty was that the acceleration discrepancy was now put in evidence by a relativistic phenomenon .",
    "many pounced upon the finding as added support for dm s presence in clusters .",
    "raqual can not deal with the new evidence ; the reason is instructive .",
    "maxwell s equations are known to be conformally invariant : replacement of the metric @xmath95 with which they are formulated by @xmath124 does not change the form of the equations .",
    "it follows that study of light propagation can not distinguish between the metrics @xmath95 and @xmath103 of raqual .",
    "accordingly , although maxwell s equations are supposed to be written with @xmath103 , the metric for studying gravitational lensing might just as well be @xmath95 .",
    "but this last obeys einstein s equations whose sources are the baryonic matter s energy - momentum tensor and that of @xmath97 .",
    "however , for systems as distended as clusters or galaxies , this last is negligible .",
    "the light bending , then , is predicted by raqual to be nearly the same as predicted by gr _ without _ dm . yet there is observational evidence that the inner parts of clusters gravitationally lense light more strongly than would be expected from gr _ with no _ dm . the same problem recurs in pcg , in which the two metrics are , again , conformally related in the same manner as in raqual .",
    "it is thus quite clear that if a scalar field is to be the vehicle for mond effects , then regardless of the form of its dynamics , the relation between the metrics @xmath103 and @xmath95 must be non - conformal .",
    "i attempted  @xcite to construct such a coupling out of scalar field alone , to wit @xmath125 with @xmath126 and @xmath127 functions of the invariant @xmath128 .",
    "however , sanders and i found that avoidance of propagation of gravitational waves which are superluminal with respect to the matter metric @xmath103 requires that @xmath129 , while @xmath130 is required so that both metrics have lorentzian signatures  @xcite .",
    "we then calculated that for equal sources of einstein s equations , the light bending in the proposed modification of raqual is _ weaker _ than that in gr .",
    "as mentioned , in systems of the scale of galaxies and clusters of galaxies , the scalar field provides very little energy or momentum density as compared to the matter .",
    "thus in regard to light ray bending , the new theory performs worse than raqual .",
    "actually the above conclusion could be avoided if @xmath131 is a _",
    "timelike _ 4-vector .",
    "however , we would expect that deep inside or near a galaxy , or a massive cluster of galaxies which is certainly virialized , the scalar field , whose principal source is the matter therein , should be quasistatic .",
    "then @xmath131 is expected to be spacelike , i.e. to give lensing weaker than needed .",
    "the problem is thus still present .    to overcome it sanders  @xcite proposed to replace @xmath131 in its",
    "above role by a nondynamical vector @xmath132 which in an isotropic cosmological model points precisely in the time direction , and approximately so in the presence of mass concentrations .",
    "he further related the metrics by @xmath133 sanders further supposed the action for the scalar field @xmath134 , which supersedes @xmath97 , to be of raqual form , or more generally with the function @xmath68 depending also on the scalar @xmath135 .",
    "the timelike nature of the vector is conducive to enhancement of the lensing , and such a theory , named stratified theory , can cope with the observations of gravitational lensing .",
    "however , it was clear to sanders that this is just a toy theory since a globally timelike vector field , such as @xmath136 , determines a universal preferred frame of reference , an aether .",
    "additionally , since the vector field is supposed constant , the theory is not covariant .",
    "the mentioned problems are avoided by making the vector field a dynamical one , as first done in t@xmath0v@xmath137s , my tensor - vector - scalar theory of gravity  @xcite .",
    "t@xmath0v@xmath137s retains the relation  ( [ gtilde ] ) between a gravitational metric @xmath95 and a physical ( or observable ) metric @xmath103 .",
    "the matter lagrangian is built exclusively with @xmath103 ; this guarantees that the weak equivalence principle will be obeyed precisely .",
    "the conventional gr einstein - hilbert lagrangian is used to give dynamics to @xmath95 , which then trivially induce dynamics for @xmath103 .",
    "the scalar field @xmath134 is provided with a raqual type lagrangian . for convenience",
    "this is couched in terms of a quadratic form in the 4-gradient of @xmath134 in interaction with a second scalar field , @xmath122 , which also occurs in a potential - like term .",
    "( however , no derivatives of @xmath122 enter , so @xmath122 is not dynamical , and if eliminated , the explicit aquadratic lagrangian for @xmath134 shows up . )",
    "the mentioned quadratic form is not the usual one , but rather @xmath138 ; it is introduced to forestall the superluminal propagation that afflicts raqual .",
    "the kinetic part of the @xmath136 lagrangian is quadratic in its first derivatives , and exactly analogous to that for a gauge field .",
    "this is not the only quadratic form possible , but it is the one in which the einstein equations for @xmath95 will not have second derivatives of @xmath136 in their sources . as mentioned , it is imperative that @xmath136 be a timelike vector . in t@xmath0v@xmath137s",
    "this is accomplished by introducing , alongside the kinetic term , a lagrange multiplier term of the form @xmath139 which forces the norm of @xmath136 to be negative ( and @xmath136 to be of unit length as a bonus ) .    whereas raqual is a one parameter ( @xmath37 ) theory with one free function ( @xmath36 ) , t@xmath0v@xmath137s has one free function , @xmath140 [ distinct from the @xmath68 in eq .",

    ", the relativistic implementations of mond involve either one or three free functions ; those with one free function have either three or four free parameters .",
    "as stressed earlier , the particular structure of t@xmath0v@xmath137s reflects the desire to encompass in the mond paradigm the observation that what passes , from a dynamical point of view , for dm in galaxies and clusters of galaxies also lenses light to a commensurate degree .",
    "how does t@xmath0v@xmath137s measure up to the task ?",

    "this is hardly surprising ; as we saw in sec .  3 , pure mond",
    "does not fully account for the acceleration discrepancy in the dynamics of quiescent galaxy clusters  @xcite .",
    "but dm models of the bullet clusters within gr are not without their problems .",
    "farrar and rosen  @xcite note that the relative velocity of the clusters is too high as compared to those seen in dm simulations of structure formation . to remove the contradiction they propose that a non - gravitational attraction of a new sort acts only between clumps of dm .",
    "but is assuming existence of dm together with a new interaction specific to it more parsimonious than a modification of standard gravity such as mond ?",
    "with my original choice of @xmath68 , t@xmath0v@xmath137s cosmological models with baryonic matter content alone can be very similar to the corresponding gr models by virtue of the scalar @xmath134 s energy density remaining relatively small  @xcite .",
    "in particular chiu et al .",
    "@xcite note that these t@xmath0v@xmath137s models give a reasonable relation between redshift and angular distances , and are thus as effective as gr models in providing the scaffolding for the analysis of cosmologically distant gravitational lenses .",
    "how would changing @xmath68 affect the evolution of a cosmological model ?",
    "this is studied exhaustively by bourliot et al .",
    "@xcite following an earlier exploration by skordis et al .",
    "bourliot et al .",
    "display a large set of variants of my @xmath68 for which , while the scalar energy density may not be negligible , it tracks or mimicks the behavior of another energy component of the model , e.g. the radiation s during radiation dominance .",
    "they also characterize shapes of @xmath68 which can lead to future singularities in cosmology , and which presumably should be avoided .",
    "mond critics have always held up the complicated power spectrum of cosmological perturbations ( background radiation or baryons ) as a proof that dm is needed on the cosmic level ; after all the spectrum is said to be well fit by the `` concordance '' dm model of the universe .",
    "this argument took for granted that mond could never measure up to the test . with t@xmath0v@xmath137s on the scene one can face the question technically .    in a massive work skordis has provided the full covariant formalism for evolution of cosmological perturbations in t@xmath0v@xmath137s  @xcite . and using this skordis et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that , without invoking dark matter , t@xmath0v@xmath137s can be made consistent with the observed spectrum of the spatial distribution of galaxies and of the cosmic microwave radiation if one allows for contributions by massive neutrinos ( in the still allowed mass range ) and the cosmological constant . in this approach the role of dark matter in standard cosmology is taken over by a feedback mechanism involving the scalar field perturbations .",
    "dodelson and liguori  @xcite have independently calculated perturbation growth , and stressed that it is rather the vector field in t@xmath0v@xmath137s which is responsible for growth of large scale structure without needing dm for this  @xcite .",
    "it thus seems there is potential in t@xmath0v@xmath137s to do away with cosmic dm , as well as with dm in galaxies .",
    "much attention is commanded today by the mystery of the `` dark energy '' , the agent responsible for the observed acceleration of the hubble expansion .",
    "such agent is obligatory in the context of gr cosmological models .",
    "quite naturally many have wondered whether t@xmath0v@xmath137s could obviate this need .",
    "diaz - rivera , samushia , and ratra  @xcite have found exact desitter solutions of t@xmath0v@xmath137s cosmology which can represent either early time inflation epochs or the late time acceleration era . in another t@xmath0v@xmath137s study ,",
    "hao and akhoury  @xcite have concluded that with a suitable choice of the t@xmath0v@xmath137s function @xmath68 , the scalar field can play the role of dark energy . and",
    "zhao  @xcite maintains that with zhao and famaey s choice of @xmath68  @xcite , cosmological models can be had that evolve at early times like those of standard cold dark matter cosmology , and display late time acceleration with the correct present hubble scale , all this without assuming dm or dark energy . for the related einstein - aether theory , zlosnik et al .",
    "@xcite remark that with suitable choice of their theory s @xmath158 , the vector field can both drive early inflation as well as double for dark energy at late times .",
    "it may be unnecessary to go far from earth to tell t@xmath0v@xmath137s , bstv and similar theories apart from gr ; the solar system can be turned into a sieve for the correct modified gravity . between any two bodies in the solar system",
    "there is an extremum point , strictly a saddle point , of some relevant field . in aqual",
    "this would be the @xmath70 potential and in t@xmath0v@xmath137s the @xmath134 field .",
    "near such a point the gradient of the said field is small , and departures from newtonian gravity are significant ( @xmath36 in aqual falls short of unity , and the derivative of @xmath68 in t@xmath0v@xmath137s is driven away from the pole which signals newtonian behavior ) . a detailed study by magueijo and me  @xcite with t@xmath0v@xmath137s shows that the anomalous regions , e.g. between sun and jupiter and earth and moon , are small , but gives some hope that with the fine guidance of space probes like esa s lisa - pathfinder ( scheduled for liftoff in october 2009 ) , it may be possible to diagnose mond - like effects .    well away from the saddle points , but still in the region occupied by the planets ,",
    "t@xmath0v@xmath137s predicts small departures of @xmath134 from @xmath16 form , i.e. small departures from newtonian behavior as encoded in @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "similar predictions issue from bstv  @xcite .",
    "these are constrained by the observed constancy of kepler s constant @xmath123 out to the orbits of the major planets , and by the absence of significant departures from gr s predictions for the precessions of the perihelia of mercury and the asteroid icarus . according to sanders",
    ", t@xmath0v@xmath137s can satisfy these constraints with choices of the function the @xmath68 proposed by refs .   and  ,",
    "which , as mentioned in sec .  7 , also lead to correct galaxy rcs .",
    "bstv can do just as well when its extra parameter , @xmath167 , is chosen properly  @xcite .",
    "both t@xmath0v@xmath137s and bstv with the above choices predict that beyond 100 astronomical units ( au ) from the sun , there is a fairly @xmath15-independent attractive component of the sun s gravitational field of strength @xmath168 .",
    "the pioneer anomaly , as measured at distances beyond 20 au , is also @xmath15-independent but stronger .",
    "is this evidence for mond ?",
    "unfortunately , the interpretation of the pioneer anomaly as an almost constant sunward acceleration seems to clash with limits on the variation of kepler s constant set with spacecraft at the distance of uranus and neptune  @xcite and with the latest ephemerides of the outer planets  @xcite .",
    "it thus seems prudent to suspend judgment until a prosaic origin for pioneer anomaly , e.g. drag by unknown matter , can be excluded with high probability .",
    "the above focuses on the nonrelativistic limit . how do relativistic mond theories fare with regard to the lowest order relativistic effects in the solar system ? as for any metric theory of gravity , these effects can be calculated from the post - newtonian ( ppn ) parameters of the theory of choice . for any metric theory it is possible to parametrize the first and second order departures of the metric from minkowski form in terms of a set of ten intuitive looking potentials  @xcite .",
    "the newtonian potential @xmath93 figures in the list , and occurs in the corrections both linearly as well as squared ; two others are @xmath169 where @xmath170 denotes the fluid velocity in the system .",
    "the post - newtonian ( ppn ) parameters are the dimensionless coefficients multiplying the diverse potentials in the correction .",
    "some examples will clarify this .",
    "the correction to the space - space part of the metric , @xmath171 , is @xmath172 ; it defines the ppn parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the correction to the temporal metric component , @xmath173 , starts with the terms @xmath174 , which define the ppn parameter @xmath175 , and also includes a @xmath176 term whose coefficient brings in a further ppn parameter , @xmath177 .",
    "each time - space metric component @xmath178 gets corrections proportional to the @xmath179 and @xmath180 ( @xmath181 denotes the velocity of the chosen coordinate system with respect to the cosmological matter comoving frame ) . with these last terms come two additional ppn parameters , @xmath182 and @xmath183 , which are called preferred frame parameters . a third one , @xmath184 ,",
    "is associated with a correction of the form @xmath185 to @xmath173 .",
    "there are four more ppn parameters for a total of ten .    the parameters @xmath175 and @xmath3 are both unity for gr and for some of it competitors .",
    "they have also been computed to be unity in t@xmath0v@xmath137s  @xcite , which thus fares as well as gr in reference to gravitational light bending , perihelia precessions of the planets , and the radar time delay .",
    "sanders  @xcite has provided a simple argument that @xmath175 and @xmath3 are always unity in a class of theories ( including bstv ) which start from the disformal relation  ( [ gtilde ] ) .",
    "next in order of relevance are the preferred frame parameters @xmath186 and @xmath184 .",
    "these vanish in gr ; after all , gr has no preferred frames . in t@xmath0v@xmath137s or bstv at least one of the @xmath187s",
    "should be nonvanishing because the vector @xmath132 establishes a locally preferred frame , with the vector pointing out the time direction in that frame .",
    "sanders argues heuristically that the @xmath187s should be strongly suppressed in both theories  @xcite . but",
    "explicitly computing the @xmath187 s for relativistic mond theories should be a high priority because they are subject to tight experimental bounds .",
    "the odyssey in search of a relativistic embodiment of the mond paradigm has led , not to one relativistic mond , but to many .",
    "t@xmath0v@xmath137s by itself exemplifies a family of theories .",
    "first there is the freedom in the choice of the function @xmath68 , which is still only modestly constrained  @xcite .",
    "next , the coefficient of the second term in the factor @xmath188 in the scalar s lagrangian can be changed to any other negative number . in t@xmath0v@xmath137s",
    "the lagrangians for @xmath134 and @xmath136 are formulated upon the metric @xmath189 ; a different but related theory emerges if one uses instead the background of @xmath190 .",
    "additionally one can replace the aquadratic lagrangian for @xmath134 by a pcg - style lagrangian for two scalars , as indeed done in sanders bstv .",
    "finally , one can altogether dispense with the scalar fields and go the way of the zlosnik - ferreira - starkman theory  @xcite .    while the lack of uniqueness of relativistic mond is a nuisance",
    ", it does add needed flexibility to the search for a `` final '' fundamental theory with which to underpin the mond paradigm .",
    "it is already clear that some of the above mentioned theories may not be in full accord with the facts .",
    "for example , the published t@xmath0v@xmath137s has an exact mond limit at low accelerations , yet as mentioned in sec .  3",
    ", mond can not handle the dynamics of clusters of galaxies without invoking additional unseen matter .",
    "an interesting escape is suggested by sanders  @xcite . in bstv",
    "cosmology , just as in the pcg one  @xcite , the @xmath122 field can undergo oscillations which generate bosonic particles early on .",
    "if the bstv parameters are right , these bosons can be trapped by clusters ( but not by galaxies ) , and can thus comprise the additional unseen matter .",
    "the charm of this resolution is that this new cold dark matter emerges from the modified gravity theory itself , and is not a separate invention .",
    "relativistic mond as here described has developed from the ground up , rather than coming down from the sky : phenomenology , rather than pure theoretical ideas , has been the main driver .",
    "actually a large industry flourishes on the sidelines with imaginative ideas from first principles regarding the essence of mond .",
    "i have not touched here on these motley approaches because they have given so little that is observationally viable .",
    "neither have i dwelt here on modified gravity theories that are not mond motivated or oriented .",
    "but the time may be ripe for turning to a more deductive approach to mond .",
    "now that we have some idea of what constitutes a viable relativistic mond theory , it should be easier to single out theoretical frameworks which might yield a promising candidate for the fundamental mond theory either as a limiting case , as an effective theory , after dimensional reduction , etc .",
    "to give an example , let us recall that brans - dicke modified gravity plus maxwellian electromagnetism in the real world can both be recovered by dimensional reduction of 5-d einstein gravity theory .",
    "t@xmath0v@xmath137s has the same number of degrees of freedom as that pair of theories ; specifically , its vector field has three degrees of freedom on account of the normalization condition , and the electromagnetic vector potential also has three on account of gauge freedom .",
    "might some variant of t@xmath0v@xmath137s arise from dimensional reduction of a pure gravity theory in 5-d ?",
    "if so , this would both ameliorate the common feeling that t@xmath0v@xmath137s is unduly complicated , and point the way to a lode for theories which might do better justice to the observations in the spirit of the mond paradigm .",
    "i thank mordehai milgrom , bob sanders and stacy mcgaugh for many useful remarks on the original manuscript , and the last two as well as douglas clowe for providing figures .",
    "research on this subject has been supported by grant 694/04 from the israel science foundation established by the israel academy of sciences and humanities .",
