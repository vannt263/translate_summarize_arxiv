    "after the introduction of electronic computers , those who carried out simulations of the gravitational @xmath0-body problem soon realized that the classical methods of numerical integration were often not satisfactorily accurate due simply to the strong @xmath1 character of the gravitational force .",
    "the situation changed when @xcite published their ( ks- ) transformation from four - dimensional to three - dimensional space .",
    "the special case of planar system had been known for a long time @xcite but it had turned out that a similar transformation in the three - dimensional space was not possible . the situation for the general @xmath0-body problem improved only after the ks transformation became well known , due in large part to publication by @xcite of their text , which comprehensively discussed the application of the ks - transformation to the perturbed two - body problem .",
    "further on , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite applied the ks transformation to the general three - body and @xmath0-body problems .",
    "an entirely new way of regularizing close encounters was invented simultaneously by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "this new method introduced the so - called logarithmic hamiltonian ( logh ) .",
    "together with the simple leapfrog algorithm , this new method gives regular results for close encounters ; in fact a correct trajectory is obtained for the two - body problem .",
    "other , similar methods are described by @xcite .    the remaining problem was that none of these regularization methods could be easily applied to systems with extremely large mass ratios . in an attempt to solve this problem",
    ", @xcite introduced the time - transformed leapfrog ( ttl ) .",
    "this method is in some cases mathematically equivalent to the logh method , but it is more general , and arbitrary mass ratios are allowed .",
    "the drawback of this method , however , is that in some cases the roundoff error affects the results considerably . in these new methods ( logh , ttl )",
    "the regularization is achieved by using the leapfrog , hence the name `` algorithmic regularization . ''",
    "more details about the thus - far mentioned methods can be found in the book by @xcite .",
    "since the leapfrog alone is rarely accurate enough , one must supplement the method with the extrapolation algorithm @xcite , or with higher - order leapfrogs @xcite , in order to get highly accurate results .",
    "efficiency of the extrapolation procedure requires that the basic algorithm ( leapfrog in algorithmic regularization , modified midpoint method in the ks - regularized codes ) have a certain symmetry . in the case of the leapfrog",
    "this means time reversibility .",
    "if the system has velocity - dependent forces , such as relativistic post - newtonian ( pn ) terms @xcite , then the required symmetry is more difficult to obtain .",
    "one way to cure this problem was recently obtained by @xcite , who formally doubled the dimensionality of the parameter space and constructed a generalized midpoint method ( gar ) .",
    "this algorithm allows the use of algorithmic regularization and velocity - dependent perturbations .",
    "however , these authors discussed the new algorithm essentially only for the case of the perturbed two - body problem .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the details of our most recent implementation of the algorithmic regularization method .",
    "this uses the chain structure , the same structure as in the ks - chain algorithm of @xcite .",
    "that device , together with a new time - transformation function , significantly reduces the roundoff problems and makes the new code a good alternative for simulations of strongly - interacting few - body systems . in the final section",
    ", we present some applications of the chain routine to the problem of relativistic orbits around the supermassive black hole at the galactic center .",
    "in this paper , we use the following basic symbols : @xmath2",
    "in the few - body problem , close approaches of two bodies are common , and these events require highly accurate computations since the energies involved are large .",
    "thus a method that can accurately advance the motions of few - body systems must be accurate and efficient for the two - body problem .",
    "in addition to the classical ks - transformation there are some new algorithms that satisfy this requirement .",
    "an additional , and most important , problem is the roundoff error .",
    "this becomes a major problem if e.g. center - of - mass coordinates are used and there are close binaries and/or close encounters in the simulated system .",
    "the cure for this problem is the use of the chain structure , originally applied with the ks - transformation @xcite in order to ks - regularize all the short(est ) distances .",
    "later it became clear that the chain structure was also beneficial in reducing significantly the roundoff error .    in this section ,",
    "we first review the ingredients we need in the construction of the final @xmath0-body algorithm .",
    "these basic algorithms produce regular results in close approaches and their results can be improved to high precision using e.g. the @xcite extrapolation method .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite pointed out that the logarithmic hamiltonian in extended phase space : @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( the binding energy ) is the momentum of time , gives the equations of motion in the form @xmath5 here we include equation  ( [ beq ] ) although this is needed only if there is a time - dependent potential to be added to the @xmath0-body potential @xmath6 .",
    "since the right hand sides of these equations do not depend on the left hand side variables , a leapfrog algorithm is possible .",
    "that may be symbolized as @xmath7 where @xmath8 means solution for the coordinate equations ( [ timeeq ] ) , ( [ coordeq ] ) with constant @xmath9 and @xmath10 over an integration step of length@xmath11 : @xmath12 correspondingly @xmath13 signifies the operation @xmath14 which solves equations  ( [ beq ] ) and ( [ peq ] ) for constant @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    for the case of two bodies only , this algorithm produces correct trajectories , with only an @xmath17 phase error .",
    "this is true even for the collision orbit and the energy conservation is , in this case , typically in the machine precision level .",
    "the second important ingredient in our algorithm is the time - transformed leapfrog @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to introduce a coordinate - dependent time transformation function @xmath18 and a new variable @xmath19 which is supposed to have the same numerical value as @xmath20 , but that value is obtained from the differential equation @xmath21 the equations of motion can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the acceleration of the @xmath24th particle .",
    "the structure of these equations allows the construction of a leapfrog algorithm : @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the average of this quantity over the step , i.e. @xmath28 here the superscripts `` old '' and `` new '' refer to @xmath29 values before and after the velocity advancement in the operation ( [ vadvance ] ) .      here",
    "we concisely review the gar method .",
    "following @xcite , we consider a differential equation @xmath30 and an approximation for its solution ( over a short step @xmath31 ) written as @xmath32 here the increment @xmath33 can be any approximation suitable for the particular equation in question .",
    "if one writes , instead of ( [ zequ ] ) , the two equations @xmath34 and solves this pair with the initial values @xmath35 , the solution obviously is @xmath36 .",
    "using the pair of equations one can write a leapfrog as @xmath37 which is actually nothing but the well known modified midpoint method . in the above one can split the advancement of @xmath38 in two operations to get @xmath39 and this can be readily generalized using the more general increment @xmath40 .",
    "this results in the generalized midpoint method @xmath41 this method has the great advantage that one can use any special approximation @xmath42 and the algorithm is time reversible ( albeit only in the extended @xmath43-space ) and thus suitable for being used as the basic integrator in an extrapolation method . specifically one may stress that the increment @xmath42 may be computed using logh or ttl which produce good approximations in case of close encounters .",
    "in addition , appearance of velocity - dependent forces is here not problematic , as shown by @xcite .",
    "while in the algorithms discussed above one can use any coordinate system , the roundoff error may be a major problem in the case of close encounters if the coordinates of the approaching bodies are measured from a distant origin .",
    "this problem is significantly reduced by utilizing the chain structure .",
    "this was originally used in a ks - regularization algorithm @xcite in order to get all the short distances regularized by the ks - transformation , but here the sole purpose is the roundoff reduction , for which the device has proved itself .",
    "let @xmath44 be the kinetic energy , and @xmath45the potential such that the total energy is @xmath46 ; the binding energy is @xmath47 .",
    "one forms a chain of particles such that the shortest relative vectors are in the chain @xcite .",
    "we stress again that the main purpose of using the chain structure in this method is to reduce the ( often significant ) effects of roundoff error .",
    "let us collect the chain coordinates @xmath48 in the vector @xmath49 and let the corresponding velocities @xmath50 be in the vector @xmath51 .",
    "then the newtonian equations of motion may be formally written @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the n - body acceleration and @xmath54 is some external acceleration ( e.g. due to other bodies ) .",
    "one may use the two equivalent time transformations @xcite @xmath55dt = [ \\alpha u+\\beta \\omega + \\gamma]dt,\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the new independent variable , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are adjustable constants , @xmath20 is an optional function of the coordinates @xmath59 , while the initial value @xmath60 and the differential equation @xmath61 determine the values of @xmath19 ( in fact , @xmath62 along the exact solution ) .",
    "the time transformation thus introduced regularizes the two - body collisions if one uses the simple leapfrog algorithm as a basic integrator ; results from which can , and must , be improved using an extrapolation method ( e.g. @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible to divide the equations of motion into two categories ( where derivatives with respect to the new independent variable @xmath63 are denoted by a prime ) .",
    "coordinate equations : @xmath64    velocity equations : @xmath65 in these equations the right hand sides do not depend on the variables on the left .",
    "consequently it is possible to construct a regular leapfrog algorithm for obtaining the solutions .",
    "the leapfrog results then can easily be improved with the extrapolation method .",
    "first we find the shortest interparticle vector which is adopted as the first part of the chain .",
    "the chain is then augmented by adding the relative vector to the particle nearest to one or the other end of the existing chain .",
    "when all particles are included , they are re - numbered along the chain as @xmath66 for ease of programming .",
    "to reduce roundoff problems , the transformation from the old chain vectors @xmath67 to the new ones is done directly by expressing the new chain vectors as sums of the old ones as in @xcite .",
    "when the particles are renamed along the chain as @xmath68 one can evaluate @xmath69 the center - of - mass quantities are @xmath70    the inverse transformation is done by simple summation @xmath71 followed by reduction to the center of mass @xmath72 note that it is not always necessary to reduce the coordinates to the center - of - mass system since accelerations only depend on the differences .",
    "one writes the equations of motion as @xmath73 where @xmath74 are the individual external accelerations and the @xmath0-body accelerations @xmath75 are @xmath76 where , for @xmath77 @xmath78 for @xmath79 one uses @xmath80 . in the acceleration computation the use of @xmath81 and @xmath82 reduces the roundoff effect significantly .",
    "this is one of the most important features of the algorithm .",
    "the kinetic energy is evaluated as usual @xmath83 while the potential @xmath84 is obtained along with the accelerations according to ( [ xerotus ] ) . for the time transformation function",
    "@xmath20 it seems advantageous to use @xmath85 here @xmath86 are adjustable constants ( see below ) .",
    "now one is able to evaluate the two time transformation functions @xmath87 which are equivalent along the correct solution i.e. @xmath88 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath19 , with @xmath60 , is obtained by @xmath89 in the presence of external perturbations the binding energy evolves according to @xmath90 the leapfrog for the chain vectors @xmath91 and @xmath92 can be written as the two mappings @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the average of the initial and final @xmath95 s ( obtained from the @xmath96 s according to the equations in section ( [ transformationsection ] ) . it is necessary to evaluate the individual velocities @xmath29 because the expressions for @xmath97 and @xmath98 in terms of the chain vector velocities @xmath99 are rather cumbersome .",
    "a leapfrog step can be written as @xmath100 and a sequence of @xmath101 steps as @xmath102   { { \\mathbf{{v}}}}(h){{\\mathbf{{x}}}}(h/2).\\ ] ] this is useful with the extrapolation method when advancing the system over a total time interval of length @xmath103 .",
    "if one takes @xmath104 then @xmath105 is mathematically equivalent to @xmath106 as was shown in @xcite .",
    "however , numerically these are not equivalent , mainly due to roundoff errors in updating the value of @xmath20 , and the logh alternative is numerically more stable . however , for proper treatment of small bodies some function @xmath20 is to be used .    for increased numerical stability in the motions of the large bodies , and",
    "smoothing of the encounters of small bodies , the recipe is @xmath107 ( but small ) and @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the mean mass product and @xmath110 .",
    "it may be advisable to integrate ( [ omegaequation ] ) for @xmath19 even if @xmath111 , in order to force the the integrator ( extrapolation method ! ) to use short steps if @xmath112 is large , thus giving higher precision when required .",
    "in fact , numerical experiments suggest that in most practical cases the parameters @xmath113 give the best results .",
    "exceptions are cases with extremely large mass ratios such that the contribution of the small masses in the potential are negligible ( e.g. zero masses included ) .",
    "this point , however , needs further investigation .",
    "one potential problem in the integration of the quantity @xmath19 is that the increments of it can be arbitrarily large if a collision of point masses occur . in this case",
    "the roundoff errors in the value of @xmath19 are significant , but do not affect much the results if the value of @xmath114 is small .",
    "one should also realize that the parameters @xmath115 can be changed during the integration ( but not during an bulirsch - stoer integration step ) .",
    "for the case of velocity - dependent perturbations @xmath116 , which occur e.g if one introduces relativistic post - newtonian terms , related algorithms were discussed in detail by @xcite ( although mostly for the perturbed two - body problem ) . here",
    "we present those ideas in the short notation used in equation ( [ shortnotation ] ) .",
    "* implicit midpoint method : * : :    we have    @xmath117    which should be solved for constant @xmath118 .",
    "this is often not easy , but it is possible to replace the exact    solution by the implicit midpoint method , i.e. one solves ( often    iteratively ) the increment of @xmath96 from    @xmath119    where @xmath120 is the value of    @xmath96 before the update    @xmath121 .",
    "this operation thus replaces the one in ( [ vupdate ] ) , and the mean    velocities ( needed in updating @xmath4 and    @xmath19 ) are obtained from    @xmath122 . *",
    "generalized midpoint method : * : :    when the generalized midpoint method is used , instead of the leapfrog ,    one can use a leapfrog step to obtain the increments    @xmath123    and here one can use for the velocity the most recent available value    of @xmath96 .",
    "one thus simply evaluates    @xmath124 the    formulation of the method then guarantees that the final approximation    has the correct symmetry ( and the correct form of the error expansion )    so that the efficient bulirsch - stoer extrapolation method can be used .",
    "+    however , one question to be addressed here is : which of the two above    methods is most efficient ?",
    "this is problem - dependent and numerical    experiments may be necessary to answer the question . in the    implementation of our code we start with the implicit midpoint method    ( which is most efficient if the number of iterations remains small ) ,    and compute a long time average of the required number of iterations    @xmath125 recursively as    @xmath126 this    slowly `` forgets '' the old values and does not grow too quickly if    there are occasional cases that require many iterations .",
    "however , when    the average number of iterations exceeds some limit , then there is    time to switch to the gar that does not require iterations ( but is    otherwise more expensive ) .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate the performance of the new algorithm and compare it with the celebrated ks - transformed chain code of @xcite .",
    "we first considered a test problem consisting of one massive particle ( the `` black hole '' ) with @xmath127 , and seven additional particles ( `` stars '' ) with masses @xmath128 .",
    "relativistic terms were not included .",
    "initial velocities were all zero so the stars moved initially on nearly rectilinear orbits toward the black hole , but their orbits become eccentric ellipses as they experience perturbations from the other stars .",
    "we set @xmath129 .",
    "we integrated the initial values given in table  1 including 2 , 3 , .. , 8 bodies and carrying out integrations up to time 1000 ( @xmath130 ) using both the old ks - chain code and the new ar - chain .",
    "two sets of experiments were conducted , one in which the bulirsch - stoer integrator automatically chose the stepsizes ( in a supposedly optimal way ) and the second with ( iteration to ) exact output times of interval @xmath131 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the results are concisely summarized in tables 2 and 3 . there",
    "we give for both methods the execution times and average values of the errors .",
    "the errors are defined in terms of the hamiltonians associated with the methods : for ar - chain the average was taken over @xmath132 and for ks - chain @xmath133 . here",
    "@xmath134=the lagrangian and the factor @xmath135 is included because in virial equilibrium @xmath136 .",
    "on the other hand the system is chaotic and the solutions are , after some time , often different ( as with any method ) and so the results must be considered as giving just a general view of the performance .    ) assuming that @xmath137 and @xmath138 remain fixed at their initial values .",
    "the blue ( small ) dots show the predicted advancement if the time - dependence of @xmath137 and @xmath138 are taken into account .",

    "the orbit remains in the @xmath139 plane ; the semi - major axis is initially parallel to the @xmath140 axis .",
    "the semi - major axis changes randomly due to perturbations from the imbh / smbh binary , but after the latter has shrunk appreciably , @xmath137 remains nearly fixed and the only evolution is uniform precession due to the post - newtonian terms . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "one sees that the accuracies are comparable , with some advantage in favour of the new method .",
    "especially we note that the new method is faster for the case of @xmath141 , i.e. a binary with eccentricity @xmath142 while the precision is essentially the same .",
    "thus one can conclude that this method works equally well , and perhaps better , than the celebrated ks - transformation .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that for the two - body system the logarithmic hamiltonian + leapfrog produces an exact trajectory with only a small error in the time , even for the collision orbit with eccentricity @xmath142 .",
    "the accuracy of the angular momentum is typically similar to that of the energy .",
    "this is largely due to the fact that the basic algorithm ( leapfrog ) used in the method conserves angular momentum exactly .",
    "however , the execution times for cases in which smaller and smaller bodies are included differ considerably in favour of the new ar - chain code . this is not very surprising , since zero masses are a singularity for the ks - chain , but ar - chain can handle zero masses too .    figure  [ fig : loge ] compares the energy conservation for the two different methods in the 8-particle integration from the initial conditions in table 1 .",
    "the system is highly chaotic and the figure shows that in this very difficult case the new method is more accurate and much faster .",

    "we considered the problem of periastron shift of a single star orbiting around the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at the center of the milky way .",
    "the particle masses were @xmath143 and @xmath144 , and the keplerian orbit had initial semi - major axis @xmath145 pc , similar to that of the `` s '' stars @xcite . in units where @xmath146 , and adopting @xmath147 mpc = @xmath148 pc as the length unit , the speed of light is @xmath149 .",

    ", we investigated the effect of an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) on the motion of a star orbiting around the milky way smbh .",
    "the imbh was given a mass of @xmath156 , semi - major axis @xmath157 mpc and eccentricity @xmath158 .",
    "the large eccentricity greatly reduced the gravitational - wave inspiral time , by a factor @xmath159 compared with a circular orbit ; inspiral required @xmath160 yr or @xmath161 initial orbital periods . to this binary system",
    "was added a third component of mass @xmath162 on an orbit having @xmath163 au and @xmath164 with respect to the center of mass of the smbh / imbh binary .",

    "initially , the apoastron distance of the imbh is @xmath166 mpc , similar to the periastron distance of the star , @xmath167 mpc , so that close interactions are allowed .",
    "the primary influence was found to be on the star s semi - major axis ; the eccentricity of the star s orbit changed only slightly .",
    "the star s periastron advancement was found to be well predicted by equation  ( [ eq : deltaphi ] ) if the time dependence of @xmath137 and @xmath138 were taken into account ( fig .",
    "[ fig : elements ] ) .",
    "a second integration without the pn terms confirmed that the imbh itself contributes only slightly to the star s precession rate for this configuration .",
    "our final numerical experiment was a one - million - year integration of a seven - body system consisting of the mw smbh ; an imbh of mass @xmath168 ; and the five , shortest - period s stars : s0 - 1 , s0 - 2 , s0 - 16 , s0 - 19 , s0 - 20 @xcite .",
    "stellar masses were set to @xmath169 and the initial positions and velocities were determined at year 2000 ad using the keplerian orbital elements given in table 3 of ghez et al .",
    "the imbh orbit was assigned an initial eccentricity of @xmath158 and semi - major axis of @xmath147 mpc , compared with @xmath170 for the stars .",
    "post - newtonian terms were included , causing the orbit of the imbh to precess rapidly and to fill the annulus @xmath171 ; for this choice of @xmath172 the gravitational wave inspiral time is @xmath173 yr , much greater than the length of the integration .",
    "three of the included stars , s0 - 2 , s0 - 16 , s0 - 19 , have periastron distances that intersect the imbh s orbital annulus and so each of these stars was able to interact closely with the imbh , although many orbital periods were required before close encounters occurred .",
    "s0 - 19 was the first to achieve positive energy , at @xmath174 ad ; before ejection the star s orbit evolved toward small @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "s0 - 16 was the next to escape , at @xmath175ad ; this star moved into a highly eccentric orbit before being ejected .",
    "s0 - 2 remained bound to the smbh / imbh binary but its semi - major axis increased gradually to @xmath176 pc , roughly equal to the radius of influence of the smbh ( if the latter were embedded in the galactic bulge ) , so in a practical sense it too may be considered to have escaped .",
    "figure  [ fig : million ] shows the evolution of @xmath137 and @xmath138 for the three stars .",
    "experiments like these could be used to constrain the mass and orbital parameters of a putative imbh near the galactic center .",
    "we have demonstrated the logh method ( with leapfrog and bulirsch - stoer - extrapolation ) is at least equally good , and for some systems better , than the ks - chain method .",
    "the optional ttl ( which we use only to provide some regularization for the occasional close encounters of very small bodies ) seems to have some problems that may have to do with roundoff error when the function @xmath19 first increases then decreases by a large amount in case of very close encounters .",
    "however , we point out that this round - off problem is reduced almost to non - existence by including in the ttl - function @xmath20 only the interactions between small bodies and using only a small factor for this quantity in the time transformation function .",
    "since the ttl function derivative is explicitly integrated it automatically reduces the stepsize in case of close approach of small bodies thus providing more careful integration of such events even if the coefficient @xmath114 is negligible .",
    "this is due to the properties ( sensitivity ) of the bulirsch - stoer extrapolation method that sees any tiny irregularity in the data and modifies the stepsize in response .",
    "this property of the bs - extrapolation method also helps if the leapfrog algorithm happens to evaluate the derivatives too close to collision of some pair of bodies : the step is rejected and re - evaluated with a different stepsize .",
    "this procedure normally avoids the repetition of a such a numerical accident .",
    "finally , our code gives the option of not using time transformation at all . even in this alternative",
    "the present code is much better than the straightforward use of center - of - mass coordinates .",
    "the reason is that the chain coordinates reduce the roundoff significantly .",
    "this is one of the great advantages of the chain structure .",

    "<S> we discuss the implementation of a new regular algorithm for simulation of the gravitational few - body problem . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm uses components from earlier methods , including the chain structure , the logarithmic hamiltonian , and the time - transformed leapfrog . </S>",
    "<S> this algorithmic regularization code , ar - chain , can be used for the normal @xmath0-body problem , as well as for problems with softened potentials and/or with velocity - dependent external perturbations , including post - newtonian terms , which we include up to order pn2.5 . </S>",
    "<S> arbitrarily extreme mass ratios are allowed . </S>",
    "<S> only linear coordinate transformations are used and thus the algorithm is somewhat simpler than many earlier regularized schemes . </S>",
    "<S> we present the results of performance tests which suggest that the new code is either comparable in performance or superior to the existing regularization schemes based on the kustaanheimo - stiefel ( ks ) transformation . </S>",
    "<S> this is true even for the two - body problem , independent of eccentricity . </S>",
    "<S> an important advantage of the new method is that , contrary to the older ks - chain code , zero masses are allowed . </S>",
    "<S> we use our algorithm to integrate the orbits of the s stars around the milky way supermassive black hole for one million years , including pn2.5 terms and an intermediate - mass black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the three s stars with shortest periods are observed to escape from the system after a few hundred thousand years . </S>"
