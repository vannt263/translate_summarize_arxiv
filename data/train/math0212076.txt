    "as discussed by bahadur @xcite , fisher information characterizes the limit of the decreasing rate of the tail probability of the optimal estimator .",
    "however , when the kullback - leibler ( kl ) divergence diverges or fisher information can not be defined , this can not be applied . as an alternative information quantity between two probabilities",
    ", we can use the relative rnyi entropies @xmath0 , which play an important role in simple hypothesis testing .",
    "( hoeffding @xcite , chernoff @xcite ) in general , for a probability distribution family @xmath1 , the relative rnyi entropies @xmath2 tend to @xmath3 when @xmath4 goes to @xmath3 , but their order is not necessarily @xmath5 . in this paper , we treat a large deviation theory , which can be applied to such a case .",
    "the importance of the relative rnyi entropies @xmath2 was pointed out by akahira @xcite from the viewpoint of information loss in a non - regular family .",
    "although the limit distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) in a non - regular family has been extensively discussed @xcite , large deviation theory has not been discussed sufficiently in this respect .    in a large deviation theory of the parameter estimation ,",
    "we usually focus on the first exponential rate @xmath6 for a sequence of estimators @xmath7 , which is simply called an estimator in the following . of course , when @xmath8 is large , the estimator @xmath9 is better .",
    "we discuss its maximization at the limit @xmath10 .",
    "as is explained in section [ s2 ] , bahadur focused on the bound @xmath11 of the first exponential rate at the limit @xmath10 , whose definition is precisely given in section [ s2 ] .",
    "he derived its upper bound from the viewpoint of stein s lemma in simple hypothesis testing .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to extend the bound @xmath11 and derive its upper bound in a more general setting .",
    "indeed , depending on how the limit @xmath10 is obtained , we can extend the bound @xmath11 in two ways .",
    "this difference can be regarded as the difference between the point estimation and the limit of the interval estimation .",
    "bahadur s original theory concerned the point estimation , but it can also be applied to the limit of the interval estimation , as is explained in section [ s2 ] . therefore , from the two ways of extending the bound @xmath11 , we can define two generalizations @xmath12 and @xmath13 of bahadur s bound @xmath11 . in section [ s3 ] ,",
    "we give the respective upper bounds @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and check that our result contains bahadur s results as a special case in which the two upper bounds @xmath14 and @xmath15 coincide .",
    "proofs of the two inequalities @xmath16 and @xmath17 are given in section [ s4 ] .    in sections",
    "[ s5 ] and [ s6 ] , we also discuss the attainability of upper bounds @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and calculate them for location shift families . in section [ s5 ] , we derive several formulae for the first exponential rates of the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) and some estimators consisting of order statistics under certain assumptions . in section [ s6 ] , using a formula for relative rnyi entropies given by hayashi @xcite , we calculate the two upper bounds @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and derive a sufficient and necessary condition for their coincidence . using formulae given in section [ s5 ]",
    ", we check that these bounds are attainable in some special cases .",
    "our examples in section [ s6 ] contain location shift families generated by a weibull distribution , gamma distribution , beta distribution , and uniform distribution .",
    "in this section , we begin by summarizing the results reported by bahadur @xcite , who discussed the decreasing rate of the tail probability in the estimation for a distribution family . given @xmath18-i.i.d .",
    "data @xmath19 , the first exponential rate @xmath8 of the estimator @xmath7 is written as @xmath20 where the exponential rates of half - side error probabilities are given by @xmath21 when an estimator @xmath7 satisfies the weak consistency @xmath22 using the monotonicity of kl - divergence , we can prove the inequality @xmath23 note that if , and only if , the family is exponential , there exists an estimator attaining the equality ( [ baha4 ] ) at @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , for a general family , it is difficult to optimize the first exponential rate @xmath8 .",
    "we usually introduce the second exponential rate as another optimized value : @xmath25 in this case , when the fisher information @xmath26 satisfies the condition @xmath27 the inequality @xmath28 holds .",
    "moreover , as was proven by fu @xcite , if the family satisfies the concavity of the logarithmic derivative @xmath29 for @xmath30 and some other conditions , the mle @xmath31 attains the equality of ( [ baha1 ] ) .",
    "these facts are summarized in the two inequalities @xmath32 inequality ( [ baha2 ] ) can be regarded as the bound of the point estimation , while inequality ( [ baha3 ] ) can be regarded as the limit of the bound of the interval estimation because @xmath33 corresponds to the bound of the interval estimation with width @xmath34 of the confidence interval .",
    "in this paper , the relative rnyi entropies @xmath35 substitute for the kl divergence .",
    "note that the order of @xmath35 is not necessarily @xmath5 at the limit @xmath10 . however , its order is independent of the parameter @xmath36 , as is guaranteed by the inequalities @xmath37 which are proven in lemma [ l38 ] of the appendix . in several cases ,",
    "the order of the first exponential rate @xmath8 coincides with the order of the relative rnyi entropies @xmath35 . in the following , we use a strictly monotonically decreasing function @xmath38 such that @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "following equations ( [ baha2 ] ) and ( [ baha3 ] ) , we define two extensions of bahadur s bound @xmath11 as @xmath41 where @xmath42 note that we take infimum @xmath43 into account in ( [ 8 ] ) , unlike ( [ 2.5 ] ) .",
    "as was pointed out by ibragimov and hasminskii @xcite , when kl - divergence is infinite , there exists a consistent super efficient estimator @xmath9 such that @xmath8 and @xmath44 is infinite at one point @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , we need to take the infimum @xmath43 into account . in this situation , we do not need to limit estimators to weakly consistent ones .",
    "as is proven in the next section , we can obtain the following theorems .",
    "when the convergence @xmath45 is uniform for @xmath46 , the inequality @xmath47 holds , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are defined by @xmath50 lemma [ ap1 ] proven in appendix [ a ] , guarantees the existence of such a real number @xmath48 .",
    "note that the function @xmath51 is concave and continuous because the function @xmath52 is concave and continuous .",
    "therefore , when @xmath53 , we have @xmath54    if the convergence @xmath45 is uniform for @xmath55 and @xmath56 for any compact set @xmath57 , the inequality @xmath58 holds .    in our proofs of these theorems , chernoff s formula and hoeffding s formula in simple hypothesis testing play important roles .    as was proven by akahira @xcite , under some regularity conditions for a distribution family , the equation @xmath59 holds .",
    "when we choose @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 , and the relations @xmath62 hold .",
    "in particular , if the distribution family satisfies the concavity of the logarithmic derivative @xmath29 for @xmath30 and some other conditions , the bound @xmath63 is attained by the mle .",
    "thus , the relations @xmath64 hold .    as a relation between two bounds @xmath65 and @xmath15",
    ", we can prove the following theorem .",
    "the inequality @xmath66 holds , and ( [ 14 ] ) holds as an equality if and only if the equations @xmath67 hold .",
    "when @xmath68 , ( [ 14 ] ) holds as an equality if and only if equation ( [ 16.3 ] ) holds .",
    "when @xmath49 is differentiable , condition ( [ 16.3 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath69 .",
    "in our proofs of theorems [ thm1 ] and [ thm2 ] , chernoff s formula and hoeffding s formula in simple hypothesis testing are essential , and are summarized as follows .",
    "let the probability @xmath70 on @xmath71 be the null hypothesis and @xmath72 be the alternative hypothesis .",
    "when we discuss a hypothesis testing problem concerning @xmath18-i.i.d .",

    "are defined as @xmath78 and their exponents are given by @xmath79 chernoff @xcite evaluated the exponent of the sum of the two errors as @xmath80 which is essential for our proof of theorem [ thm1 ] .",
