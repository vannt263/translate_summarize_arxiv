    "the low energy scattering of @xmath1 with deuterium has been the subject of much study in the past @xcite and it is one of the processes where the impulse approximation is manifestly insufficient , the rescattering terms being quite large . the input in all these studies is elementary amplitudes for @xmath0 scattering which are either taken from experiment or evaluated within theoretical models .",
    "the theoretical models for @xmath0 are rather involved since there are many coupled channels which have to be dealt with consistently ( concretely , 10 physical channels in the @xmath4 channel , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) . theoretical studies with coupled channels were used in refs .",

    "@xcite the strength of the different transition potentials was determined from fits to the data allowing only modifications of up to 50 percent from the su(3 ) relations .",
    "the introduction of chiral lagrangians in the meson baryon sector @xcite has allowed one to deal with this interaction from the modern chiral perspective . yet , a unitary treatment with coupled channels is necessary in this case since perturbation theory can not be applied , among other reasons due to the presence of the @xmath15 resonance below the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "coupled channel lippmann schwinger equations are used in refs .",
    "@xcite including the channels which are physically open , and some terms from higher order chiral lagrangians are obtained from fits to experiment . in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath16 and @xmath17 channels are also included and a good description of the low energy data is obtained , amongst them the properties of the @xmath15 resonance , which is generated dynamically from the lowest order chiral lagrangian with the coupled channel equations . in this later case only the lowest order lagrangian was used together with a cut off which was the only free parameter of the theory .",
    "a justification of the success of the method omitting the higher order lagrangians can be seen by comparing the similar success in the meson meson sector of the coupled channel equations using the lowest order lagrangians @xcite and the more refined inverse amplitude method in coupled channels @xcite , case which also includes the @xmath18 lagrangian ( see also discussions to this respect in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the case of @xmath1 deuteron scattering requires also the explicit treatment of the coupled channels .",
    "the faddeev equations rely already on partial summations over the different channels which lead to the @xmath19 @xmath20 matrix on each individual nucleon , but even then the explicit channels appear in the multiple collisions with two different nucleons and the faddeev equations can be generalized to these channels @xcite . in the present work we follow these lines but we observe that the relevant channels in the faddeev equations are the @xmath21 and @xmath22 channels .",
    "the channels involving @xmath23 , and other inelastic ones by analogy , require at least three successive collisions on the nucleons of the deuteron and provide a negligible contribution to the deuteron scattering length .",
    "we simplify the faddeev equations with the @xmath0 channels by means of the fixed centre approximation for the nucleons ( fca ) and obtain the result already derived in @xcite , although we do not indulge in the isospin symmetry assumed there .",
    "the results obtained in this formalism improve on those reported in @xcite using the fca approach and including only the elastic @xmath1 collisions . nevertheless , the main novelties of the present results come from the use of the new elementary amplitudes obtained in the recent chiral approach to the @xmath0 interaction",
    ".    the measurement of the @xmath1 deuteron scattering length can thus provide information on some of the @xmath0 elementary amplitudes provided the others are already known . assuming isospin symmetry , the knowledge of the @xmath4 scattering amplitude allows one to obtain the @xmath24 scattering length using the faddeev formula . however , one of the findings of this work and the one of ref .",
    "@xcite is that isospin symmetry is not very accurate for energies close to threshold so one has to admit certain uncertainties when extracting the elementary amplitudes from the deuteron scattering data . in any case",
    "the deuteron results will provide extra checks of accuracy of the modern chiral theories used for the @xmath25 interaction .",
    "our treatment involves only the evaluation of the strong interaction scattering length .",
    "coulomb corrections to the deser formula @xcite to extract the scattering length from the measurement of the width and shift of the 1s level of the @xmath1 deuteron atom planned at frascati  @xcite have been worked out in ref .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the dynamics of @xmath27 scattering at low energies is dominated by the presence of the @xmath15 resonance and needs to be described by non - perturbative methods . in this section",
    "we review the approach followed in ref .",
    "@xcite and present the results for the scattering lengths of the elementary @xmath19 reactions needed in the calculation of the @xmath28 scattering amplitude , namely @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "( [ eq : chiral ] ) one derives all possible transition amplitudes between the different meson - baryon states of a given charge and strangeness that can be built from the meson and baryon octets .",

    "( [ eq : v ] ) are then inserted in a coupled - channel bethe - salpeter equation @xmath56 from where one extracts the elastic and transition scattering amplitudes .",
    "the indices @xmath57 run over all possible meson - baryon channels and @xmath58 is the loop function containing the propagators of the meson and baryon in the intermediate states .",
    "although in the former equation the last term on the right hand side involves in principle the off - shell dependence of the amplitudes , the simple form of @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) allows to reabsorb the off - shell pieces of the amplitude into renormalization of the coupling constant @xmath60 , as shown in ref .",
    "therefore , the @xmath61 and @xmath20 amplitudes simply factorize on - shell out of the loop integral and the problem reduces to one of solving a coupled set of algebraic equations , with @xmath58 given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 stand , respectively , for the baryon mass , the baryon energy and the meson mass in the intermediate state , and @xmath65 is the total energy in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame .",
    "the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and summarized here depends on one parameter , the loop regularization cut - off , @xmath66 . using the particle basis , a value of @xmath67 mev was adjusted to reproduce the @xmath4 scattering branching ratios at threshold . at the same time",
    "the weak decay constant was slightly modified to @xmath68 , a value lying in between the empirical pion and kaon weak decay constants , in order to optimize the position of the @xmath15 resonance .",
    "the scattering cross sections , which were not used in the fit , were shown to be in good agreement with the low energy data .",
    "the scattering lengths are obtained from the amplitudes @xmath69 through @xmath70 and the relevant ones for the study of @xmath28 scattering are shown in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "we also give there the results for the scattering lengths from the isospin formalism , obtained by first solving the bethe - salpeter equation for the various isospin channels and then transforming the isospin amplitudes back to the particle basis .",
    "it is well known that the impulse approximation fails to describe the @xmath1 deuteron scattering length .",
    "furthermore even the contribution of a few terms of the multiple scattering series does not give accurate values for the scattering length .",
    "this indicates that the multiple scattering series does not converge rapidly for @xmath71 elastic scattering at low energies .",
    "therefore , in this case more sophisticated approaches based on the solution of the faddeev equations are required",
    ".    on other hand , there are many difficulties in the solution of the faddeev equations for the @xmath71 elastic scattering . the first one is related to the coupling to many inelastic channels with @xmath72 , and @xmath73 baryons which make the solution of the problem technically difficult .",
    "the second problem is related to the isospin symmetry which is often used in the solution of the faddeev equations .",
    "indeed , as seen from the considerations in the former section , isospin for @xmath26 scattering is a good quantum number only with accuracy of 20% .",
    "in such a situation the use of the physical channels for the coupled equations becomes more realistic than using an isospin formalism .",
    "this of course increases the number of the coupled channels making the numerical procedure more complicated .    thus getting an unambiguous information about @xmath26 scattering lengths from elastic @xmath71 scattering",
    "becomes a difficult task .",

    "when @xmath90 , taking into account the relations between @xmath20-matrices and scattering lengths ( or amplitudes ) @xmath91 we obtain the following simple expression for the @xmath71 scattering length in the impulse approximation @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the deuteron and nucleon masses , respectively , and @xmath95 is the kaon mass .",
    "the numerical value was obtained using the elementary amplitudes @xmath96 and @xmath97 in the physical basis at @xmath98 mev , which corresponds to having the proton and neutron on shell at rest .",
    "the amplitudes can be seen in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "note that in general within the impulse approximation the effects from the motion of the nucleons has to be taken into account in the evaluation of the elementary @xmath20-matrix .",

    "thus we can see that the contribution to the real part of @xmath120 from the double scattering is larger than that from the impulse approximation .",

    "we also found that isospin is only an approximate symmetry for @xmath71 scattering and violation of the isospin symmetry can be as large as 30% , hence , one should not rely upon isospin considerations when evaluating the @xmath71 scattering length .",
    "comparison of the present results with the experimental results expected from the dear experiment at frascati should bring light on some of the issues involved in the problem , like chiral symmetry and partial isospin breakup .",
    "the findings of this paper should also be of much of use when trying to extract information on elementary amplitudes from the deuteron data . the formulas which we obtain would allow one to deduce @xmath97 from @xmath120 using isospin relationships , but , as discussed above , this would induce uncertainties of up to 30% . we have seen that the general formulas , without assuming isospin symmetry , rely upon four scattering lengths @xmath206 .",
    "knowledge of three of them from other experiments and the use of the deuteron data would allow one to obtain information on the fourth .",
    "conversely , we can say that the deuteron data will introduce a further check of consistency between elementary amplitudes determined either experimentally or theoretically .",
    "we would also like to acknowledge financial support from the dgicyt under contracts pb96 - 0753 , pb98 - 1247 and aen97 - 1693 , from the generalitat de catalunya under grant sgr98 - 11 and from the eu tmr network eurodaphne , contract no .",
