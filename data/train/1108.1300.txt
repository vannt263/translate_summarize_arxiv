    "lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) @xcite has confirmed that at finite temperature and small baryon density qcd exhibits restoration of chiral symmetry and deconfinement . however , owing to the fermion sign problem , the thermodynamics of strongly interacting matter at large baryon densities is presently not accessible by first principle lqcd calculations .",
    "a viable framework for exploratory studies of qcd at finite density is however offered by phenomenological models and effective theories .",
    "the polyakov loop extended nambu ",
    "jona  lasinio ( pnjl ) and quark  meson ( pqm ) models reproduce essential features of qcd thermodynamics already in the mean - field approximation .",
    "however , to correctly account for the critical behavior and scaling properties near the chiral phase transition , thermal and quantum fluctuations must be included in a non - perturbative manner .",
    "this can be achieved e.g. by using methods based on the functional renormalization group ( frg )  @xcite .",
    "we compute the cumulants of the net - quark number density ( @xmath0 ) and electric charge density ( @xmath1 ) at finite temperature and baryon chemical potential .",
    "we show that the higher - order cumulants exhibit a distinctive structure in the vicinity of the transition , where they become negative .",
    "such a structure follows from the scaling functions of the three dimensional o(4 ) universality class  @xcite",
    ". ratios of such cumulants have been suggested as sensitive probes for the critical behaviour and the rapid change of degrees of freedom at the qcd phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the quark  meson model is an effective realization of the low  energy sector of qcd , which incorporates chiral symmetry . by introducing the coupling of quarks to a uniform temporal color gauge field represented by the polyakov loop ,",
    "the model can be employed to explore properties related to color confinement .    in order to account for non - perturbative mesonic fluctuations in the pqm model , we employ methods based on the functional renormalization group ( frg ) .",
    "the frg involves an infrared regularization of the fluctuations at a sliding momentum scale @xmath2 , resulting in a scale dependent effective action @xmath3 , the so - called effective average action  @xcite .",
    "we treat the polyakov loop as a background field , which is introduced self - consistently on the mean - field level while the fluctuations of the quark and meson fields are accounted for by solving the frg flow equations .",
    "the flow equation for the scale - dependent grand canonical potential density , @xmath4 , for the quark and meson subsystem reads  @xcite @xmath5        + \\frac{1}{e_\\sigma } \\bigg [ 1 + 2n_b(e_\\sigma;t )        \\bigg ]    \\right .",
    "\\\\ \\nonumber & & \\left .",

    "the fermion distribution functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 are modified because of the coupling to the gluon field .",
    "finally , the quark energy is given by @xmath13 .",
    "the minimum of the thermodynamic potential is determined by the stationarity condition @xmath14 the flow equation  ( [ eq : frg_flow ] ) is solved numerically with the initial cutoff @xmath15 gev ( see details in refs .",
    "the initial conditions for the flow are chosen to reproduce vacuum properties : the physical pion mass @xmath16 mev , the pion decay constant @xmath17 mev , the sigma mass @xmath18 mev and the constituent quark mass @xmath19 mev at the scale @xmath20 .",
    "the symmetry breaking term , @xmath21 , corresponds to an external field and does not flow .    by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : frg_flow ] ) , one obtains the thermodynamic potential for the quark and meson subsystem , @xmath22 , as a function of the polyakov loop variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the full thermodynamic potential @xmath25 in the pqm model , including quark , meson , and gluon degrees of freedom is obtained by adding the effective gluon potential @xmath26 to @xmath27 : @xmath28 at a given temperature and chemical potential , the polyakov loop variables , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are then determined by the stationarity conditions : @xmath29",
    "the fluctuations of conserved charges are quantified by cumulants @xmath30 , which are generalized susceptibilities obtained by taking derivatives of the pressure @xmath31 with respect to the corresponding chemical potential @xmath32 : @xmath33 .",
    "the cumulants of conserved charges are sensitive probes of the chiral phase transition .",
    "they indicate the position , the order , and in case of the second - order phase transition the universality class of the corresponding phase transition .",
    "the net baryon number density @xmath34 is discontinuous at a first - order transition , whereas the susceptibility @xmath35 and higher cumulants diverge at the critical end point  @xcite and at the spinodal lines of a first - order chiral phase transition  @xcite . in the chiral limit and at non - zero chemical potential ,",
    "all generalized susceptibilities @xmath0 with @xmath36 diverge at the @xmath37 chiral critical line  @xcite , while at vanishing chemical potential this divergence shows up only for @xmath38 .",
    "close to the phase transition the sixth and eighth order cumulants decrease from their positive values in the hadron resonance gas to negative values , in accordance with the expected dominance of the o(4 ) singularity  @xcite .",
    "since the fourth order cumulant is unaffected by chiral critical phenomena at zero chemical potential , it remains positive for small chemical potentials , as in the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) .",
    "however , at larger densities , it picks up a non - trivial contribution from higher order @xmath39 cumulants , as seen in the taylor expansion @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the fourth order cumulant and consequently the kurtosis ( @xmath41 ) may become negative close to the crossover transition even if the critical end point does not exist @xcite .",
    "the location of the first zeros of @xmath0 for @xmath42 and 8 are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the middle panel shows that the region , where the sixth order cumulant of the net baryon number fluctuations is negative , is closely correlated with the crossover transition .",
    "the frg method can also be applied to compute the fluctuations of electric charge in the pqm model .",
    "here the differences relative to the mean field calculations are essential , since the frg approach accounts for charged pion contributions to @xmath43 . in fig .  1 we show the range of negative @xmath44 , which is similar to that found for @xmath45 .",
    "thus , negative fluctuations of the sixth order moments of net baryon as well as net electric charge fluctuations can both be attributed to chiral critical dynamics .",
    "consequently , the experimental observation of negative sixth order cumulants in heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc would indicate that the chemical freeze - out takes place in the vicinity of the chiral crossover transition @xcite ."
