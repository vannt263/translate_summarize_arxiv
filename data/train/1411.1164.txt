    "although the observational evidences in favour of the recent accelerated expansion of the universe are mounting everyday , the driver of this acceleration has neither been detected nor does any of the candidates has a clear verdict on theoretical grounds .",
    "a cosmological constant is the most favoured one , but it has its share of problems @xcite . amongst a host of other possibilities , a scalar field with a potential , leading to an effective negative pressure , popularly called a quintessence field , appears to enjoy the second highest priority @xcite .",
    "relativistic theories of gravitation , other than the general theory of relativity , are also invoked .",
    "for example , an @xmath2 theory of gravity , where the ricci scalar @xmath3 in the einstein action is replaced by an analytical function @xmath4 , does well in explaining the accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "another popular direction is to look for an accelerated model in an already existing nonminimally coupled scalar field theory , particularly brans - dicke theory or some of the modifications of the theory @xcite . in such theories , the scalar field or some function of",
    "the same is nonminimally coupled to the gravity sector in the action in the form @xmath5 .",
    "recently another form of a nonminimally coupled scalar field theory , where the scalar field is coupled to the matter sector rather than the geometry , has been proposed .",
    "a chameleon field , characterised by a `` chameleon mechanism '' is an example of such a field nonminimally coupled to matter @xcite .",
    "a consequence of this mechanism is that the mass of the scalar field is not a constant but rather changes with the ambient matter distribution .",
    "this change of properties of the field acts as a buffer in connection with the observational bounds set on the mass of the scalar fields coupled to the matter sector @xcite .",
    "+ chameleon scalar fields have many interesting features .",
    "for instance , a strongly coupled chameleon has the possibility of being detected by carefully designed experiments @xcite .",
    "possible effect of the chameleon field on the cosmic microwave background with possible observational imprints has been estimated by davis , schelpe and shaw @xcite and that on the rotation curve of galaxies by burikham and panpanich @xcite .",
    "one very attractive feature of a chameleon field is that if it is coupled to an electromagnetic field @xcite in addition to the fluid , the fine tuning of the initial conditions on the chameleon may be resolved to a large extent @xcite .",
    "the remarkable features of the chameleon field theories are comprehensively summarized by khoury @xcite .",
    "+ brax _ et al _ used this chameleon field as a dark energy@xcite .",
    "this kind of interaction between the dark matter and the dark energy was investigated in detail by das , coarsaniti and khoury@xcite in the context of the present acceleration of the universe .",
    "it was also shown that with a chameleon field of this sort , it is quite possible to obtain a smooth transition from a decelerated to an accelerated expansion for the universe@xcite .    the success of the chameleon mechanism in explaining the current accelerated expansion and its lucrative properties which open up the possibility to evade a fine tuning of initial conditions , and its possible observational imprints inevitably attracted a lot of attention .",
    "the possibility of a scalar field nonminimally coupled to gravity , such as the brans - dicke scalar field , acting as a chameleon was discussed by das and banerjee @xcite .",
    "brans - dicke scalar field acting as a chameleon with an infrared cut - off as that in the holographic models was discussed by setare and jamil @xcite .",
    "the field profile of a chameleon was discussed by tsujikawa , tamaki and tavakol @xcite .",
    "+ the aim of the present work is to thoroughly investigate the stability criteria of the chameleon models in a spatially homogeneous and isotropic cosmology .",
    "there are two arbitrary functions of the chameleon field @xmath6 to start with , namely @xmath7 and @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the dark energy potential and @xmath10 determines the coupling of the chameleon field with the matter sector .",
    "we broadly classify the functions into two categories , exponential and non - exponential .",
    "so there are four combinations in all .",
    "we investigate the conditions for having a stable solution for the evolution for each of these categories .",
    "we find that there are possibilities of finding a stable evolution scenario where the universe may settle into a phase of accelerated expansion .",
    "however , if both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are exponential functions of @xmath6 , the stability is very strongly dictated by the model parameters .",
    "in fact it is noted that in this latter case there is a possibility of a transient accelerat ion at the present epoch but the final stable configuration of the universe is that of a decelerated expansion . +",
    "the method taken up is the dynamical systems study .",
    "the field equations are written as an autonomous system and the fixed points are found out .",
    "a stable fixed point indicates a sink and thus marks the possible stable final configuration of the universe whereas an unstable fixed point , indicating a source , may describe the possible beginning of the evolution .",
    "application of dynamical systems in cosmological problems , mostly for scalar field distributions , is already there in the literature @xcite . for detailed discussions on some early work on such investigations , we refer to the monograph by coley @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 deals with a chameleon scalar field model in a spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic universe . in section 3",
    "the system of equations given in section 2 are written as an autonomous system .",
    "this section also includes a brief discussion of the method of the stability analysis that is used in the present work .",
    "the actual stability analysis in the four categories as mentioned is given in section 4 .",
    "the fifth section presents an example of a chameleon field where the chameleon mechanism together with the constraints imposed by laboratory experiments does not have any contradiction with the cosmological requirement of the decelerated expansion entering into an accelerated phase at a redshift of 0.74@xcite .",
    "the sxith and the final section summarizes and discusses the results .",

    "@xmath12 is given by @xmath13 alone .",
    "this indeed is not a standard description .",
    "however , for a collection of collisionless particles with non - relativistic speed , the rest mass of the particles completely dominates over the kinetic energy , the contribution from the pressure is negligible compared to the rest energy .",
    "the density is defined to be the contribution to that by these collisionless particles .",
    "this is thus quite a legitimate choice@xcite for a pressureless fluid , which would be relevant for the dark matter distribution .",
    "+ by varying the action with respect to the metric tensor components , one can find the field equations . for a spatially flat frw spacetime given by the line element    @xmath14",

    "we take ( [ cons ] ) , ( [ h ] ) and ( [ wave ] ) to constitute the system of equations .",
    "there are , however , four unknowns , namely @xmath24 .",
    "the other variable , @xmath25 , is known in terms of @xmath26 via the equation ( [ rhom ] ) .",
    "it is intriguing to note that even with the nonminimal coupling with the scalar field , the matter energy density itself still redshifts as @xmath27 ( see reference @xcite ) +",

    "this stability analysis can also be done from sign of the trace(tr ) and determinant(det ) of @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath53 , then the fixed point is stable and if @xmath54 , then the fixed point is an unstable fixed point .",
    "+ for a system of nonlinear equations , the situation is a bit more complicated . let us consider a system of non linear differential equations , written in the form @xmath55 fixed points(@xmath52 ) are the solutions of the simultaneous equations , @xmath56 .",

    "if the perturbed solutions asymptotically approach the fixed points , the corresponding fixed points are considered stable .",

    "the system formed by the equations ( [ x]),([z ] ) , ( [ lambda ] ) and ( [ delta ] ) , has the fixed points as listed in table 1 .",
    "+    .fixed points of class i type models [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     trace and determinant of the jacobian matrix at @xmath67 and @xmath68 are @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "conditions for stability of @xmath67 and @xmath68 are , + 1 .",
    "+ 6.@xmath76 .",
    "+ the fixed point @xmath77 is irrelevant as it requires a negative @xmath78 and thus a negative @xmath79 and @xmath67 is relevant only in cases where @xmath80 is negative for the same reason . in",
    "what follows , an example of an unstable and that of a stable fixed point of this class are given .",
    "we choose @xmath81 and the deceleration parameter @xmath82 @xcite in order to pick up some relevant values of the model parameters @xmath83 and @xmath84 . with this value of @xmath85 , it is easy to see from the definitions of @xmath86 and @xmath87 that @xmath88 and thus from the constraint @xmath89 , one has @xmath90 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath91 . from the field equations ( [ cons ] ) and ( [ h ] ) , one can write @xmath92 which yields @xmath93 . now from the table 7 , table 8 and list of the stability conditions of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , one can check that for @xmath94 and @xmath95 , one has @xmath96 as an unstable fixed point and @xmath67 as a stable one .",
    "so the universe is apt to start its evolution from @xmath96 and settle into a final configuration at @xmath67 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath97 against @xmath98 and that of the cosmological parameters @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath85 and @xmath101 against @xmath98 are given in figures 8 and 9 respectively .",
    "it is easy to check that the universe starts with a deceleration ( @xmath102 ) but with @xmath103 and @xmath104 and settles down to final phase of decelerated expansion with @xmath105 and again the same state of @xmath103 and @xmath106 .",
    "there is an accelerated expansion in between , around the present stage of evolution ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "+ as this case effectively reduces to a 2-dimensional problem , one can draw the phase plot in @xmath86 and @xmath78 , for the given values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , 1.8 and -0.1 respectively .",
    "the plot is shown in figure 10 . in figure 11",
    ", we zoom the plot around @xmath107 in order to understand the stability a bit more clearly .         and @xmath108 against n for class iv models for @xmath94 and @xmath95 ]        ]",
    "khoury discussed the restriction of the mass of the chamaleon field vis - a - vis the coupling of the chameleon field with matter considering the compatibility of adaptation of the chameleon with the ambience and the requirement of the laboratory based experiments@xcite .",
    "the example taken up is the one for which @xmath110 and @xmath111 . here",
    "@xmath112 and @xmath113 are constants and @xmath114 determines the strength of the coupling @xmath10 .",
    "the allowed band in the @xmath115 vs @xmath114 plot was worked out .",
    "+ the example is clearly in the class i of of the present work where both of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are non - exponential functions . in this case @xmath116 and @xmath117 , both are independent of @xmath114 . as an illustration , we take up the case for @xmath118 . with the boundary values of @xmath86 ,",
    "@xmath78 chosen from observational constraints as in section 4.4 , one can plot the variables @xmath119 and @xmath84 ( figure12 ) .",
    "the plot of the deceleration parameter @xmath99 against @xmath98 ( figure 13 ) shows that the universe has a smooth transition from a decelerated to an accelerated expansion approximately at @xmath120 which corresponds to a redshift of 0.74 , which perfectly matches the observation@xcite .",
    "so we find one example where this transition happens independent of the coupling of the scalar field with matter and hence posing no threat to the allowed band between @xmath114 and the mass of the scalar field .",
    "it also deserves mention that the system has starts evolving from an unstable fixed point @xmath121 and approaches to a stable fixed point @xmath122 , which also agrees very well with the present dynamical systems analysis of classi models .     and @xmath84 against @xmath98 for @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "]     for @xmath123 and @xmath124 . ]",
    "the stability of the various chameleon scalar field models are investigated in the context of the present accelerated expansion of the universe in the present work .",
    "the aim is not to suggest any new model of dark energy , but rather to look at the various possibilities where a chameleon field can indeed serve as driver of the acceleration , starting from a decelerated situation .",
    "an unstable fixed point might describe the initial stage of the universe from where a small perturbation could trigger the start of the evolution whereas a stable fixed point is apt to describe the final stage of the universe . unlike many of the dark energy models , a chameleon field has the distinct possibilities of being detected and hence that of being nullified as well .",
    "thus it warrants attention regarding the choice of the favoured combination of the dark energy potential and the coupling with matter .",
    "+ for the sake of convenience , the functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 are classified as either exponential or not .",
    "so in all there are four such combinations , which are quite extensively studied in the present work .",
    "in fact any old ( or new ) chameleon model with given @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the stability criteria need not be checked afresh .",
    "the present investigation provides a complete set of choices for @xmath0 and @xmath1 and can serve as the diagnostics .",
    "+ it is found that if both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are exponential functions , @xmath84 and @xmath83 are not dynamical variables but are rather some parameters .",
    "the stability of the fixed points depends on the values of these parameters and it opens up a possibility for a transient acceleration for the universe around the present epoch .",
    "the other observation is that when @xmath9 is exponential and @xmath10 is not , @xmath9 effectively resembles a cosmological constant and when @xmath10 is exponential but @xmath9 is not , the matter - chameleon coupling is actually broken . + it is interesting to note that the fixed point @xmath125 with @xmath126 and @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 are in fact the same , where there is no fluid and the scalar field sits at a non - zero minimum .",
    "so all the different combinations of @xmath9 and @xmath10 coincide at this fixed point which formally resembles a de sitter model .",
    "+ we can also find at least one example where the cosmological observations of the transition from the decelerated phase to the accelerated one can happen without any contradiction with the allowed band between the mass of the scalar field and its coupling with matter .",
    "+ as already mentioned , the basic aim was not to propose a new chameleon model but rather to provide an exhaustive study of the stability characteristics of all possible combination of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this purpose is achieved quite comprehensively and as a bonus some interesting physical features are also noted .",
    "for example , it is noted that a chameleon field can give rise to a transient acceleration for the universe and certian combination of the potential @xmath9 and the coupling @xmath10 leads to a breakdown of the chameleon mechanism itself . +",
