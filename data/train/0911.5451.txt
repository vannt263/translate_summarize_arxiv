    "meanwhile , the temperature and luminosity of the coolest known member of taurus , 2 m  0437 + 2331 , correspond to an age of 100  myr according to the evolutionary models , which is much older than expected for a member of taurus . stars with edge - on disks and nonmembers can appear to have very low luminosities on the h - r diagram .",
    "however , a disk does not appear to be present (   [ sec : ldwarf ] ) and the strengths of the gravity - sensitive lines of this object provide strong evidence of youth .",
    "instead , the old isochronal age for this object is likely a reflection of errors in the adopted temperature scale and evolutionary models .",

    "in fact , the position of the coolest known member of chamaeleon  i on the h - r diagram is very similar to that of 2 m  0437 + 2331 .",

    "2 m  0437 + 2331 is the coolest known member of taurus and may be one of the least massive known brown dwarfs .",
    "it was selected for spectroscopy based on red irac colors that suggested the presence of a disk ( it was not detected by mips ) . to reliably determine whether 2 m  0437 + 2331 does indeed have a disk , we must compare its colors to those of stellar photospheres . for these comparison sources ,",
    "we select all known late - type members of taurus and young late - m and l dwarfs in the solar neighborhood @xcite that have been observed by irac .",

    "these data form two distinct groups , a narrow sequence of stellar photospheres and a broader distribution of redder sources that have disks .",
    "2 m  0437 + 2331 is only slightly redder than the photospheric sequences ( @xmath24  mag ) and does not exhibit color excesses as large as those found among the taurus members that have disks ( @xmath25  mag ) .",
    "thus , we do not find significant evidence of a disk for this object .",
    "as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : color ] , the photospheric irac colors become redder from m to l types among young objects , which explains why 2 m  0437 + 2331 was identified as a possible disk - bearing object through our irac color criteria .",
    "because young stars and brown dwarfs that lack irac excesses rarely exhibit evidence of accretion in h@xmath13 @xcite , the h@xmath13 emission in the spectrum of 2 m  0437 + 2331 probably arises from the stellar chromosphere rather than accretion .",
    "the ir spectrum of 2 m  0419 + 2712 has strong h@xmath10o absorption and is highly reddened ( @xmath26 ) , making it the most heavily obscured late - type member of taurus found to date .",

    "<S> we present the results of a search for new members of the taurus star - forming region using data from the _ spitzer space telescope _ and the _ xmm - newton observatory_. we have obtained optical and near - infrared spectra of 44 sources that exhibit red _ spitzer _ colors that are indicative of stars with circumstellar disks and 51 candidate young stars that were identified by scelsi and coworkers using _ xmm - newton_. we also performed spectroscopy on four possible companions to members of taurus that were reported by kraus and hillenbrand . through these spectra , we have demonstrated the youth and membership of 41 sources , 10 of which were independently confirmed as young stars by scelsi and coworkers . </S>",
    "<S> five of the new taurus members are likely to be brown dwarfs based on their late spectral types ( @xmath0m6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> one of the brown dwarfs has a spectral type of l0 , making it the first known l - type member of taurus and the least massive known member of the region ( @xmath1 - 7  @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> another brown dwarf exhibits a flat infrared spectral energy distribution , which indicates that it could be in the protostellar class  i stage ( star+disk+envelope ) . upon inspection of archival images from various observatories </S>",
    "<S> , we find that one of the new young stars has a large edge - on disk ( @xmath3  au ) . </S>",
    "<S> the scattered light from this disk has undergone significant variability on a time scale of days in optical images from the canada - france - hawaii telescope . </S>",
    "<S> using the updated census of taurus , we have measured the initial mass function for the fields observed by _ xmm - newton_. the resulting mass function is similar to previous ones that we have reported for taurus , showing a surplus of stars at spectral types of k7-m1 ( 0.6 - 0.8  @xmath4 ) relative to other nearby star - forming regions like ic  348 , chamaeleon  i , and the orion nebula cluster . </S>"
