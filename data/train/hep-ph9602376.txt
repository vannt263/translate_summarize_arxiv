    "the distribution of charmonium states in @xmath0 meson decays is of special interest , because it provides a testing ground for color suppression in @xmath0 decays already attainable in the present experiments . at the @xmath5 mass scale ,",
    "a leading order calculation generates a consistent pattern of color suppression for the production of @xmath11-wave charmonium states . in the context of the ` color singlet mechanism '",
    "the production is related to the decay of a @xmath5 quark in the @xmath0 meson , at short distances , into a color singlet @xmath12 pair plus other quarks and gluons .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath14 have almost equal momenta and reside in the appropriate angular - momentum state .",
    "this subprocess is dominated by the color suppressed internal @xmath15-exchange diagram , where hard gluon exchanges lead to an effective neutral current @xcite .",
    "deviations from this leading order ` singlet mechanism ' , which arise from relativistic corrections and soft gluon induced fragmentation of the @xmath12 into charmonium , affect the normalization but not the structure of the amplitude @xmath16 ( in which @xmath17 sums over hadronic states ) @xcite .",
    "several authors made predictions for the branching ratio of the direct decay @xmath16 to leading order in @xmath18 [ 15 ] .",
    "recently a next - to - leading order qcd calculation was reported @xcite .",
    "the authors pointed out that the process under consideration can not be explained presently by a standard application of perturbative qcd .",
    "the difficulties entering the analysis arise from the strong suppression of the leading order color singlet wilson coefficient , causing considerable cancellations in three different orders of @xmath18 .",
    "alternatively one may use a phenomenological factorization approach and take into account deviations from this prescription by replacing the color singlet renormalization coefficient by an effective neutral current coefficient @xmath19 , which has to be determined from experimental data in a model dependent way .",
    "both argus and cleo reported on inclusive @xmath0 decays to @xmath2 , where they identified a sizable component of decays with three or more particles in the final state @xcite . in a recent publication @xcite cleo",
    "presented an analysis based on a data sample , which is one order of magnitude larger than those of previous studies , corresponding to an error reduction by a factor of @xmath20 .",
    "a comparison between theory and experiment requires the branching ratio resulting from _ direct _ decays .",
    "therefore the group corrected the measured @xmath2 spectrum for the ` feed - down ' modes @xmath21 and @xmath22 . as a result they found the direct branching ratio @xmath23 . a theoretical analysis carried out by the cleo group following ref .",
    "@xcite yields @xmath24 , in good agreement with the measurement , where the phenomenological factorization prescription has been applied using a value @xmath25 .",
    "the latter value has to be modified when incorporating bound state effects for the initial @xmath0 meson , which have to be included in order to gain a theoretical prediction of the @xmath2 momentum spectrum within an inclusive approach .",
    "so far there is not available a detailed fit to experimental data of momentum spectra obtained from theory .",
    "palmer and stech have made a preliminary attempt using a simple wave function formalism @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will investigate two different approaches in order to account for the experimental results .    as stated above a sizable component of the momentum spectrum",
    "is due to nonresonant multi - particle final states .",
    "consequently , for a wide range of phase - space an inclusive description using quark - hadron duality , which was extensively applied in the inclusive _ semileptonic _ decays of @xmath0 mesons , will be appropriate .",
    "the semileptonic decays involve large energies and momentum transfers of the weak current over most of the phase - space .",
    "several groups noticed that these kinematic regions investigate the light - cone behaviour of currents for which the methods of deep inelastic scattering are valid .",
    "there are various approaches available which derived useful results describing the lepton spectrum in the decay @xmath26 .",
    "these approaches use different formalisms , but they still follow two basic steps . + ( i ) the decay of the @xmath27 which are propagating as free particles is considered and the resulting spectrum is folded with the momentum distribution of the @xmath5 quark obtaining moments of the quark distribution @xcite .",
    "a similar approach is given by the accmm model @xcite , in which one accounts for the binding effects by treating the spectator quark as particle on the mass shell with nonzero momentum and averages over this momentum .",
    "+ ( ii ) after the introduction of the point - like behaviour one still has to calculate the expectation value of the bilocal transition operator between the initial hadronic state to gain the width of the decay . in this context",
    "the new development is the application of the operator product expansion ( ope ) , which involves an expansion in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass @xmath28 incorporating the formalism of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the lepton energy spectra requires a modified expansion in powers of @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the normalized lepton energy [ 1823 ] .",
    "+ the analytic form of the structure function of the heavy quark within the @xmath0 meson controls the endpoint behaviour of the leptonic spectrum , since in this region the ope does not converge .",
    "it has been shown that the prediction of hqet far from the endpoint gives approximately the same shape of the spectrum as the accmm model with a fermi motion parameter @xmath31 gev @xcite . yet",
    "the model dependence of this region is quite small @xcite .",
    "therefore it is of great relevance to test the approaches with decay channels of the @xmath0 meson different from the semileptonic one in order to extract the momentum distribution function of the heavy quark in a direct way and then compare it with the distribution function obtained in semileptonic decays .    the inclusive decay @xmath1 provides a well suited testing ground since , as we shall show , in this process the dependence on the structure function of the @xmath5 quark is more direct , i.e. , the @xmath2 momentum spectrum is proportional to the distribution function .",
    "a qcd based analysis of the decay using hqet is only of limited validity , since due to the smaller energy release the convergence of the ope is less reliable than for semileptonic decays .",
    "therefore one has to resort to a formalism in which the structure function can be modeled in terms of parameters that may be obtained from experiment .",
    "we will apply two different approaches . in section [ ipm - sec ]",
    "we present a field - theoretical version of the inclusive parton model , which two of us together with jin already applied for semileptonic decays @xcite . in section [ ac - sec ]",
    "we calculate the @xmath2 momentum spectrum within the framework of the accmm model . in each of the analyses we determine the distribution parameter of the structure function from a comparison to the recent cleo data .",
    "the overall normalization of the theoretical spectra further provides information respecting the value of the effective color singlet coefficient @xmath32 .",
    "finally we use our results to extract the value of @xmath33 in the accmm model from the semileptonic decay channel of the @xmath0 .",

    "in order to investigate the interaction which induces charmonium production in @xmath0 decays , we start at the quark level at a high - energy scale where the hamiltonian is known .",

    "the renormalization functions ( wilson coefficients ) @xmath36 have been computed up to the next - to - leading order corrections in ref .  @xcite .    the effective interaction ( [ leff ] ) is evaluated using a factorization prescription by which the amplitude can be written as a product of matrix elements of current operators .",
    "deviations from this prescription are parametrized by substituting the color suppressed singlet coefficient by a free parameter @xmath19 which is written in terms of the effective number of colors @xmath37 and has to be determined by model - dependent fits to the experimental data , @xmath38 @xmath19 is equivalent to the coefficient introduced for type - ii processes in the factorization model of bsw @xcite for _ exclusive _ decays . using cleo data from two - body decay modes with @xmath2 mesons in the final state , an analysis within the bsw model yields @xcite @xmath39 where the second systematic error is due to the @xmath0 meson production fractions and lifetimes .",
    "theoretical uncertainties mainly due to hadronic form factors are not included . a corresponding analysis @xcite using the model of _ neubert et al . _",
    "@xcite provides a central value @xmath40 , whereas that of _ deandrea et al .",

    "we extend the factorization model for exclusive two - body decays to an inclusive picture at the quark level .",
    "this is reasonable because , as was stated in ref .",
    "@xcite , many - body final states will most likely start as two color singlet quark antiquark pairs , including intermediate massive resonances , where strong phases from final state interactions disappear in the sum of all states .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite made use of this inclusive picture to determine the lifetime ratio @xmath45 . as we intend to reproduce not only the branching ratio but also the momentum spectrum for the decay @xmath1 , we have to incorporate the momentum distribution of the @xmath5 quark in the @xmath0 meson . in our analysis",
    "we will let the effective color singlet coefficient @xmath32 to float within the range which is covered by the various models for exclusive modes .",
    "we consider the matrix element of the hamiltonian ( [ leff ] ) for our process ( in the explicit notation we only refer to the dominant decay involving an @xmath46 quark in the final state ) , @xmath47 where we make use of the phenomenological factorization prescription .",
    "the second term of eq .",
    "( [ leff ] ) does not contribute between color singlet states .",
    "for the matrix element of the @xmath48 at the origin we use the current - identity for pure vector - like states , @xmath49 this identification is valid , because the time - scale of the interaction to be considered is larger than the scale for the formation of the singlet state @xmath50 ) .",
    "@xmath51 is the @xmath2 decay constant and can , to leading order in the relative heavy quark velocity @xmath52 , be related to the radial part of its nonrelativistic wave function . in principle",
    "one can determine @xmath51 from the electromagnetic decay @xmath53 , but practically one is confronted with the ignorance of higher order qcd corrections to the decay rate which might be of great relevance in view of existing large leading order corrections . within the studies of",
    "_ exclusive _ two - body decays @xmath54 @xcite the central value of the decay constant was fixed at @xmath55 gev which results from the omission of any qcd correction ( as of relativistic corrections to the wave function of the @xmath2 ) .",
    "this analysis refers to the 1990 particle data group value for the branching ratio of @xmath53 .",
    "therefore when extracting @xmath32 from _ inclusive _ @xmath0 decays we will use the above value in order to compare the result with eq .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "this procedure requires some additional remarks which concern both the studies of exclusive and inclusive decays .    relating the parameter which contains the nonperturbative effects in the production of @xmath56-charmonium with the @xmath2 decay constant implies the neglect of color octet contributions to the fragmentation process in the explicit calculation . in ref",
    "@xcite it was argued in the framework of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) , that the fragmentation of a @xmath57 state into a @xmath2 in the long - distance scale may give sizable contributions to the @xmath1 decay rate .",
    "this feature occurs , despite the fact that the color octet operator is of the order @xmath58 respecting the velocity counting rules in the nrqcd , because of the large suppression of the color singlet wilson coefficient .    as the structure of the amplitude for the effective point - like decay @xmath16 remains unchanged , considering nonleading effects in the fragmentation process",

    "the shape of the theoretical spectrum is determined by the distribution parameter @xmath3 , which is illustrated in fig .  4 where we show the spectrum for @xmath101 and several values of @xmath3 .",
    "a general feature of the analysis is our difficulty in reproducing the data over the whole range of phase - space .",
    "confronted with this problem , we lay greater emphasis on the appropriate description of the _ low _ momentum range ( @xmath102 gev ) in our simultaneous fits of @xmath32 , which in this decay has the meaning of a pure normalization constant , and the distribution parameter @xmath3 . within this region",
    "the @xmath2 spectrum obtains a sizable contribution from decay channels containing three or more particles in the final state ( where higher @xmath103 resonances are assumed to be unimportant ) , whereas the high momentum range is purely determined by the exclusive two - body decays @xmath104 . therefore incoherence as a necessary ingredient of",

    "furthermore we demand the reproduction of the measured branching ratio for the decay under consideration . thus if we apply small values for the distribution parameter @xmath105 we can not account for the low momentum region , which is underestimated significantly within the theoretical spectrum ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "on the other hand , demanding the reproduction of the branching ratio , a distribution corresponding to @xmath106 would imply a value @xmath107 , which is beyond the range given from the study of exclusive two - body decays . therefore , in spite of the difficulty to reproduce the data accurately over the whole range of phase - space , the investigation of the decay @xmath1 is more restrictive with regard to the distribution parameter than the semileptonic decay of the @xmath0 meson which involves an integral over the structure function .    considering the fact that the ipm does not include hadronization effects and consequently yields an averaged spectrum , a satisfactory description of the dataset",
    "is achieved for @xmath6 , @xmath108 ( compare fig .",
    "5 ) when using current masses for the final state quarks . applying constituent masses would involve an incorrect position of the maximum of the momentum spectrum and , in addition , a sizable underestimate of the high momentum range ( see fig .",
    "yet also for @xmath109 there is apparent a moderate systematic underestimate of the latter region .",
    "since the model presumes the existence of multiple final states it may not hold for the high momentum range ( @xmath110 gev ) where two - body decays determine the spectrum . following the cleo analysis , as a trial",
    "we subtract the expected contribution of the exclusive decays @xmath111 from the data for the semi - inclusive momentum spectrum .",

    "7 we show the modified spectrum for @xmath101 and @xmath3 as stated there",
    ". this additional fit may serve as an indication that a value @xmath113 has to be suggested within the model when restricting the analysis of decay spectra to the ` incoherence region ' where multi - particle final states exist .",
    "then additional information from a model describing the dominant two - body decay channels has to be implemented to reproduce the data over the whole range of phase - space .    finally , the errors in the data , although substantially improved , are still significant and a crucial test will be possible , when the error bars are further reduced .",

    "the application of the value for @xmath4 , which we obtain from our investigation of the decay @xmath1 , to the semileptonic decay channel requires some additional remarks . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite the universality of the momentum distribution function describing the motion of the @xmath5 quark in the @xmath0 meson only holds for different decay processes when referring to a fixed final state quark mass .",
    "the common procedure , followed in the analysis of the semileptonic decay @xmath165 , is to determine the distribution parameter from a fit of the lepton spectrum away from the endpoint where the spectrum is dominated by @xmath166 transitions .",

    ". within this analysis the application of the accmm model to @xmath166 transitions has to be regarded as a phenomenological fit , because from a theoretical point of view the neglect of fermi motion in the final state is only appropriate , when small final state quark masses are involved @xcite .",
    "the latter remark illustrates the importance of a study which is independent of the semileptonic data .",
    "our investigation of the decay @xmath1 allows a suitable determination of the parameters of the accmm model which can be used for the analysis of the endpoint spectrum in the decay @xmath165 .",
