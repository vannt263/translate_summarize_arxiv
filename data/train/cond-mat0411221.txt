    "granular fluids are usually modeled as systems composed by smooth hard spheres with inelastic collisions .",
    "the collisions are specified in terms of the change in relative velocity at contact but with a decrease of the magnitude of the normal component measured by a ( positive ) coefficient of restitution smaller than or equal to 1 . for this interaction model ,",
    "the boltzmann equation ( be ) has been conveniently modified to account for the inelasticity of binary collisions and the transport coefficients have been determined for a single gas @xcite as well as for multicomponent systems @xcite . however , the evaluation of those coefficients for inelastic hard spheres ( ihs ) is quite involved since they are given in terms of the solutions of linearized integral equations which can be approximately solved by considering the leading order in a sonine polynomial expansion of the velocity distribution function . for this reason ,",
    "other interaction models that simplify the mathematical structure of the boltzmann collision integrals for ihs have been considered in the past few years . as for ordinary gases ,",
    "the be for inelastic maxwell models ( imm ) has been also introduced @xcite . the imm share with elastic maxwell molecules the property that the collision rate is velocity independent but , on the other hand , their collision rules are the same as for ihs .",
    "although these imm do not correspond to any microscopic interaction potential , the cost of sacrificing physical realism is in part compensated by the amount of exact analytical results that can be derived from this simple model .",
    "most of the studies performed for imm have been devoted to homogeneous states , especially in the analysis of high - energy asymptotics of the velocity distributions . on the other hand ,",
    "much less is known on the dependence of the transport coefficients on dissipation , especially for mixtures . in the case of a binary mixture subjected to simple shear flow , the relevant rheological properties of the system ( shear and normal stresses )",
    "have been exactly obtained @xcite .",
    "these results show an excellent agreement with those obtained analytically for ihs in the first sonine approximation and by means of monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "more recently , the be for inelastic maxwell mixtures has been solved @xcite from the chapman - enskog method for states close to the ( local ) homogeneous cooling state .",
    "explicit expressions of the navier - stokes transport coefficients of imm in @xmath0 dimensions have been derived in terms of the coefficients of restitution and the ratios of mass , concentration , and particle sizes .",
    "comparison with known results for ihs @xcite shows a reasonably good agreement , especially for the transport coefficients associated with the mass flux .",
    "the knowledge of the transport coefficients of imm for mixtures allows quantitative application of the nonlinear hydrodynamic equations to a number of interesting problems . here , we consider two different applications .",
    "first , we study small perturbations of a spatially homogeneous state and determine the dispersion relations for the hydrodynamic modes .",
    "this analysis allow us to identify the conditions for stability as functions of the wave vector , the dissipation , and the parameters of the mixture .",
    "as in the monocomponent case @xcite , linear stability analysis shows two transversal ( shear ) modes and a longitudinal ( heat ) mode to be unstable with respect to long wavelength excitations . as a second application , we explore the validity of onsager s reciprocal relations @xcite among the different transport coefficients associated with the mass and heat fluxes . for ordinary gases",
    "these relations are a consequence of time reversal invariance of the equations of motion of the individual particles .",
    "since a granular fluid is inherently time irreversible ( there is a irreversible loss of kinetic energy in collisions ) , violation of onsager s relations is expected with increasing dissipation .",
    "the interesting point here is to assess the influence of inelasticity on the failure of these reciprocal relations as well as to identify the origin of such a violation .",

    "the balance equations ( [ 2.9])([2.11 ] ) apply regardless of the details of the model considered for inelastic collisions .",
    "however , the influence of the collision model appears through the dependence of the cooling rate and the hydrodynamic fluxes on the coefficients of restitution .    as happens for elastic collisions @xcite , the main advantage of using imm",
    "is that a velocity moment of order @xmath51 of the boltzmann collision operator only involves moments of order less than or equal to @xmath51 @xcite .",

    "one important difference with respect to the conventional chapman - enskog method for ordinary gases is that the reference state ( zeroth - order approximation ) of the expansion is not the local equilibrium state but the so - called ( local ) homogeneous cooling state , whose explicit form is not known @xcite . very recently , the chapman - enskog solution to the be ( [ 2.1 ] ) has been worked out to first order in gradients of the fields .",

    "the expressions for the mass flux ( [ 3.1 ] ) , the heat flux ( [ 3.2 ] ) , the pressure tensor ( [ 3.3 ] ) , and the cooling rate ( [ a7 ] ) provide the necessary constitutive equations to convert the balance equations ( [ 2.9])([2.11 ] ) into a closed set of six independent equations for the hydrodynamic fields . since the irreversible fluxes have been represented in terms of the gradients of the mole fraction @xmath72 , the pressure @xmath31 , the temperature @xmath22 , and the flow velocity @xmath21 , it is convenient to use these as the independent hydrodynamic variables .",
