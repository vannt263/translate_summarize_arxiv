    "because of its proximity , almost face - on orientation , and prominent spiral structure , the interacting sbc galaxy m51 has been a favorite target of observational astronomers for many years .",
    "the ultraviolet imaging telescope image of m51 reported here , obtained with @xmath15 arcsec resolution , represents a 5-fold increase in resolution compared to prior uv imaging ( bohlin et al .",

    "uit is a 38 cm ritchey - chrtien telescope , which images a @xmath16 diameter field to the cathode of a two - stage magnetically focussed image intensifier , coupled by fiber optics to ii - ao film .",
    "the intensifier has a uv - sensitive , solar - blind csi photocathode .",
    "( the intensifier for the near - uv camera , which functioned well during the 1990 astro-1 mission , was apparently damaged during the astro-2 launch , so near - uv data were obtained from the ground in the u band . )",
    "the uit instrument , the available bandpasses , and the reduction of the digitized film images to arrays of flux - calibrated integer pixels are discussed by stecher et al . (",
    "the bandpass used in this investigation is termed b1 , with centroid @xmath0   and width @xmath17  .",
    "fluxes @xmath18 measured in this uit band are converted to magnitudes @xmath19 by the relation @xmath20 .",
    "the longest b1 exposure obtained , and the one used in this investigation , is of duration @xmath21 s. a north - up , east - left version of the image was corrected for image distortion using the method of greason et al .",

    "the interacting companion ngc 5195 is much less prominent in the near - uv than at optical wavelenths .",
    "the nuclear region shows a complex structure , with evidence for star formation and possibly for an inner lindblad resonance at radius @xmath25 arcsec . in combination with a digitized photographic image in the @xmath26 band",
    ", evidence was found for a variation in @xmath27 colors of bright h   regions of about @xmath28 magnitude ( here , @xmath29 is the magnitude in the sounding rocket band ) .",
    "a uv image of m51 at wavelength 2000  , also with @xmath22 arcsec resolution , was obtained by bersier et al .",
    "( 1994 ) with a balloon - borne telescope .",
    "bersier et al .",

    "the companion galaxy ngc 5195 , visible on the u band image , is not detectable on the uit far - uv image .",
    "the sounding rocket image appears as figure  1b in bohlin et al .",

    "we present and discuss multiband photometry of 28 m51 uv sources , and surface photometry in the far - uv and u band images .",

    "from a fourier analysis of their uv image , bersier et al .",
    "( 1994 ) determined the position angle and inclination of m51 to be 26 degrees and 42 degrees , respectively , consistent with previous estimates .",
    "we adopt their position angle and inclination to contruct equivalent face - on azimuthally averaged radial profiles in the uit b1 band and the ground - based u band .",
    "the uv profiles are similar to the profile of bersier et al .",

    "( 1990a ) . from the b1 and u band profiles",
    "the @xmath2 color profile is constructed and plotted in figure  [ fuvufig ] .",

    "the sky value is determined as the mode of pixels within annuli with inner and outer radii @xmath31 and @xmath36 arcsec .",
    "aperture photometry is performed using idl implementations of daophot software ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "no aperture correction is employed in the uit image photometry because any extended emission beyond the boundary of the @xmath37 arcsec aperture appears to be associated with extended , diffuse spiral arm emission , rather than the source itself .",
    "the h@xmath1 aperture correction for the nearly - isolated h   region rand 454 , is only about @xmath38% .",
    "hence , we apply no aperture corrections to the h@xmath1 fluxes either , because the corrections are small , and also because the sources do not have identical profiles .",
    "_ iue _ spectra of isolated stars from several fields observed by uit are utilized in determining the uit calibration , thought to be accurate to about 15% relative to _ iue_. uit instrumental fluxes used in determining the calibration are from apertures large enough to contain all the stellar flux .",
    "calibration of the u band photometry , with uncertainty about 5% , is based on the photoelectric photometry of schweizer ( 1976 ) .",
    "subtraction of the red continuum from the h@xmath1 band image is accomplished by scaling count rates of stars in the r image to equal their counterparts in the h@xmath1 image ( waller 1990 ) .",
    "the effect of line emission in the r - band image is estimated and removed using the filter curves for the two bands . the contribution of [ nii ] ( @xmath39 ) line emission to the total h@xmath1 + [ nii ] line flux is estimated to be 35% in emission ( mccall et al 1985 ) and 28 % through the h@xmath1 filter .",

    "the quoted h@xmath1 fluxes have been corrected accordingly .",
    "absolute calibration of the h@xmath1 and r images uses ccd images of the spectrophotometric standard star bd + 08 2015 taken on the same photometric night with the same instrument .",
    "the resulting h@xmath1 photometry of the h   region rand 454 agrees with that of rand ( 1992 ) to within 8% .",

    "the uv cmd for the h   regions of m51 is similar to the uv cmd for the m81 hii regions ( hill et al .",

    "the relatively modest change in predicted uv color for a factor two increase in metallicity suggests that the primary cause of the observed color gradient in m51 is a radial extinction gradient .",

    "the fit relation between the @xmath45 of nakai & kuno ( 1995 ) and the uv colors is then used to estimate @xmath45 for all 28 h   regions .",
    "we estimate the metallicities of the h   regions from the galactocentric distance , assuming that the h   region rand 454 has solar metallicity and that the metallicity variation with increasing distance is @xmath62 dex / arcmin ( villa - costas & edmunds 1992 ) .    the uv spectrum over the wavelength interval @xmath63 to @xmath64   is computed for imf slope @xmath11 ( hill et al .",

    "uv colors @xmath4 are computed from these model spectra , and used to determine the variation of the unreddened uv color with radius , allowing computation of the uv color excess @xmath67 for each of the h   regions .",
    "the ratio of the uv color excess to @xmath68 is then used to derive far - uv extinctions , by interpolating the normalized far - uv extinction over the normalized uv color excess between the 30 dor nebular extinction curve ( fitzpatrick & savage 1984 ) , and the orion extinction curve ( bohlin & savage 1981 ) .",
    "we derive normalized far - uv extinctions @xmath5 for the h   regions which vary from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , with average value @xmath69 .",

    ", we can estimate the fraction of the lyman continuum photons which are absorbed by hi atoms rather than by dust grains , as the ratio of the observed h@xmath1 flux ( corrected for the extinction estimated from @xmath4 ) to the h@xmath1 flux expected from the extinction - corrected @xmath19 , the evolving starburst model with imf slope equal to @xmath11 , and the assumption that the age is @xmath13 myr , and taking into account the variation of metallicity with radius .",
    "we define an effective lyman continuum extinction as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the h@xmath1 flux predicted from the extinction corrected uv flux and the assumed age @xmath13 myr , and @xmath72 is the extinction corrected h@xmath1 flux .",

    "( 1996 ) for two lines of sight in the lmc , then for the 28 h   regions investigated here , the fraction of the optical extinction which takes place inside the h   region averages @xmath75 , and ranges from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",

    "the co azimuthal profiles of kuno et al .",

    "<S> hii regions show decreasing observed h@xmath1 fluxes with decreasing radius , relative to the h@xmath1 fluxes predicted from the observed @xmath12 for age @xmath13 myr , after the h@xmath1 and @xmath12 are corrected for extinction . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the increasing fraction of `` missing '' h@xmath1 flux with decreasing radius to increasing extinction in the lyman continuum . </S>",
    "<S> the increasing extinction - corrected far - uv flux of the h   regions with decreasing distance to the nucleus is probably a result of the corresponding increasing column density of the interstellar gas resulting in larger mass ob associations . </S>",
