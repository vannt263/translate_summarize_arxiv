    "a _ right - angled artin group _ is a finitely presented group @xmath0 which can be described by a finite graph @xmath1 , the _ presentation graph _ , in the following way : the vertices of @xmath1 are in bijective correspondence with the generators of @xmath0 and the defining relations in @xmath0 consist of a commuting relation between each pair of generators connected by an edge in @xmath0 .",
    "right - angled artin groups interpolate between free groups ( defined by graphs with no edges ) and free abelian groups ( defined by complete graphs ) . in between these two extremes , right - angled artin groups include a rich source of interesting groups . in this paper",
    "we will describe the quasi - isometric classification of a family of such groups .",
    "the two main families of right - angled artin groups which have been classified are those whose presentation graphs are trees or _ atomic_. it was proven by behrstock and neumann @xcite that all right - angled artin groups which have a presentation graph a tree of diameter greater than two are quasi - isometric to each other and are not quasi - isometric to any other right - angled artin groups ; trees of diameter two give the product of a nonabelian free group with an infinite cyclic group and these are all quasi - isometric to each other and to no other right angled artin group by work of kapovich and leeb @xcite ; the tree of diameter 1 corresponds to @xmath2 , which is not quasi - isometric to any other right - angled artin group .",
    "atomic graphs were introduced by bestvina , kleiner and sageev ; these are connected graphs with no valence one vertices , no cycles of length less than five , and no separating closed vertex stars ; they proved that right - angled artin groups with presentation graphs that are atomic are quasi - isometric if and only if the groups have isomorphic presentation graphs @xcite .",
    "note that both trees and atomic graphs yield artin groups with cohomological dimension at most 2 since the cohomological dimension of the group is the number of vertices of a maximal complete subgraph ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the only other family of connected right - angled artin groups we are aware of which is completely classified is given by complete graphs ; this follows since @xmath3 is quasi - isometric to @xmath4 if and only if @xmath5 .",
    "since all other right - angled artin groups have free subgroups it follows that these groups are not quasi - isometric to any other right - angled artin group .",

    "the artin group @xmath49 is thus the product of a free group of rank @xmath50 with @xmath3 . giving the free group the redundant presentation @xmath51 allows us to naturally think of it as the fundamental group of a @xmath52punctured sphere @xmath53 .",

    "we call the decomposition of @xmath61 into its pieces the _ geometric decomposition_. there is a corresponding graph - of - groups decomposition of @xmath14 with two kinds of vertex groups , the fundamental groups of the pieces and the fundamental groups of the separating tori ; the edge groups are copies of the fundamental groups of the separating tori , one copy for each geometric piece that the torus bounds .    for a complex @xmath64 and for any piece @xmath47 as above",

    "we label each vertex by the index of the @xmath7-simplex vertex which is not on the spine of the corresponding piece .",
    "hence the label set for the vertices are the elements of the set @xmath67 .",

    "the /distinction gives a bipartite structure on our tree @xmath21 .",
    "the vertices to which a given vertex is connected have distinct labels , so a vertex has valence at most @xmath22 ( and at least @xmath69 ) .",
