    "<S> the empirical pairing gaps derived from four different odd - even mass staggering formulas are compared . by performing single-@xmath0 shell and multi - shell seniority model calculations as well as by using the standard hfb approach with skyrme force we show that the simplest three - point formula @xmath1 $ ] can provide a good measure of the neutron pairing gap in even-@xmath2 nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> it removes to a large extent the contribution from the nuclear mean field as well as contributions from shell structure details . </S>",
    "<S> it is also less contaminated by the wigner effect for nuclei around @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the strength of @xmath4 can serve as a good indication of the two - particle spatial correlation in the nucleus of concern and that the weakening of @xmath4 in some neutron - rich nuclei indicates that the di - neutron correlation itself is weak in these nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of a systematic odd - even staggering ( oes ) of the nuclear binding energy has long been identified in nuclear physics , which is associated with the pairing correlation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it plays an important role in many nuclear phenomena and is the dominant many - body correlation beyond the nuclear mean field . yet , in spite of the many efforts performed in the study of pairing correlations , there are still features which may be induced by the pairing interaction that are not well understood @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , this is the case in neutron - rich nuclei , where the study of effects induced by pairing may shed light on the understanding of various exotic phenomena ( see , e.g. , refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest expression one can use to extract the empirical pairing gap from the oes of the binding energy is the three - point formula @xcite , which for systems with even neutrons acquires the form  @xcite @xmath5\\\\ = -\\frac{1}{2}[s_n(n+1,z)-s_n(n , z)]\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the ( positive ) binding energy and @xmath7 is the one - neutron separation energy . the proton pairing gap can be defined in a similar way . </S>",
    "<S> the above formula indicates that @xmath8 measures the additional binding gain by the last neutron in the even-@xmath2 system relative to the odd system with one more neutron . </S>",
    "<S> however , besides pairing , a number of other mechanisms may contribute to the oes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this includes effects induced by the mean field in deformed nuclei ( or the kramers degeneracy ) and the contribution from the diagonal interaction matrix elements of the two - body force .    as discussed in detail in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by satula and co - workers , the contribution from the quickly varying single - particle structure of the mean field to the empirical pairing gap is minimized in odd - mass systems . in even systems where the last neutrons occupy different orbitals </S>",
    "<S> the single - particle energy contributes substantially to @xmath8@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , there is another version of the three - point formula written as @xmath9\\\\ = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[b(n , z)+b(n-2,z)-2b(n-1,z)\\right ] \\\\ = \\frac{1}{2}[s_{2n}(n , z)-2s_n(n-1,z)],\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which actually corresponds to @xmath10 for the case of odd nuclei @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 is smaller than @xmath8 in most cases . </S>",
    "<S> it is often stated that @xmath11 measures the pairing effect in the odd nuclei , as illustrated in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , whereas @xmath8 is impacted by single particle states ( see e.g. , recent discussion in ref . @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> the challenging problems thus arise include : one lacks a measure of the pairing gap in the even system , which is mixed with the deformation effect , and the empirical pairing gap for the odd system is related to pairing only in an indirect manner ( i.e. , the energy loss due to the absence of pairing ) . </S>",
    "<S> the physics becomes even more obscure when abrupt changes occur , e.g. , around shell closures . in practice , as a compromise , the value of @xmath11 has often been compared to the theoretical pairing gap calculated for the even systems @xcite and to the oes derived from theoretical binding energies @xcite . the direct comparison between the theoretical pairing gap and empirical oes is convenient from a computational point of view since only one single calculation is required , which avoids the complicated handling of the blocking effect in the odd nuclei .    it is known that the theoretical pairing gap , e.g. , that from the bcs theory , is not an observable and can not be compared with the empirical oes in a straightforward way . </S>",
    "<S> however , they can be quantitatively quite close to each other in most cases and both of them are still important quantities that deserves further attention . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , within the bcs approach , the corresponding pairing gap is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the pairing strength , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the standard occupation numbers . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the pairing gaps can serve as a signature of the change in two - particle spatial correlation / clusterization , since they are also proportional to @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is also responsible for the clustering of the four nucleons that eventually constitute the @xmath17-particle at the nuclear surface of heavy nuclei @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we would like to argue that , among the expressions for the oes studied here , the simple three - point formula @xmath18 removes to a large extent the contribution from the varying part of the nuclear mean field as well as contributions from other shell structure details and can serve as a reliable indication for the pairing effect in even-@xmath2 systems . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , @xmath18 can be compared to the theoretical pairing gap in a semi - quantitive manner and thus contains fruitful information on the pairing effects . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the abrupt changes in @xmath18 do have physical meaning . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by using @xmath18 one can make it more convenient to extract the neutron - proton interaction from binding energy differences @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will also show that @xmath18 is free from the wigner effect for nuclei around @xmath3 and that its weakening in some neutron - rich nuclei may indicate that the di - neutron spatial correlation itself is weak in those nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> there are other formulas available for the pairing gap including the so - called four - point and the five - point formulas . </S>",
    "<S> the four - point formula is defined as  @xcite @xmath19\\\\ = \\frac{1}{2}[\\delta^{(3)}(n)+\\delta^{(3)}_c(n)].\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] that is , it measures the average value of @xmath10 in adjacent even and odd systems . </S>",
    "<S> the five - point formula is given by  @xcite @xmath20\\\\ = \\frac{1}{4}[\\delta^{(3)}_c(n+2)+2\\delta^{(3)}(n)+\\delta^{(3)}_c(n)].\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the five - point formula is also used in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in refs . @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the experimental pairing gap is taken as the average of adjacent ones deduced through the three - point formula as @xmath21 , \\end{aligned}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is actually also a five - point formula involving the same group of nuclei as @xmath22 but with different weights for each nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that there is no significant difference between the results derived from @xmath23 and @xmath18 for open - shell nuclei where the pairing gap is a smooth function of @xmath2 . for the same reason , @xmath24 and @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> show quite a similar behavior for most nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> noticeable differences between @xmath26 and @xmath18 may be seen where abrupt changes in pairing correlations are expected to happen , e.g. , around shell closures , which is smoothed out in the former case .    </S>",

    "<S> it is also seen that the dependence of the gap upon the neutron or mass number is weakest for @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the conclusions of refs . </S>",

    "<S> the mean values of the pairing gaps corresponding to the different expressions given above are ( in mev ) @xmath8 = 1.46 , @xmath4 = 1.08 , @xmath42 = 1.26 and @xmath22 = 1.26 . </S>",
    "<S> we also evaluated the empirical pairing gaps for the proton for which one obtains @xmath43 mev , which contains a smooth contribution from the coulomb field .    </S>",
    "<S> in table [ tab : fitt ] we also included calculations for the even-@xmath2 odd-@xmath44 nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> however , it should be mentioned that the empirical oes @xmath4 thus extracted contains a sizable negative contribution from the residual neutron - proton interaction between the odd particles in the intermediate odd - odd nuclei .    as indicated in eqs . </S>",

    "<S> fig : diff_gaps_subplot3 ] and [ fig : diff_gaps_subplot4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersal of the data below @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) as well as around shell closures can be an indication of the significant mean - field contribution to the gaps in above regions , which is expected to show a @xmath50 dependence @xcite . in this context it is worthwhile to point out that the differences between @xmath8 and @xmath28 was found to be a consequence of the gap between the single - particle energies of the corresponding neighboring orbitals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diff_gaps_subplot4 ] , the differences between @xmath47 and @xmath51 show quite small values for nuclei that can be reasonably described within a single-@xmath0 shell or nearly - degenerate systems , e.g. , for nuclei with @xmath2 between 20 and 28 ( @xmath52 ) as well as @xmath2 below ( @xmath53 ) and above ( @xmath54 ) @xmath55 . for these systems , as we will show below , the difference between @xmath47 and @xmath51 is mainly induced by the pauli and particle blocking effects .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath56 show quite large values around @xmath3 nuclei with @xmath57 and 22 . </S>",
    "<S> one may suspect that @xmath56 is still contaminated by the wigner effect , which refers to the additional binding gained in @xmath3 nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed the case for all the other three oes formulas where , as seen in the lower right panel of fig . </S>",

    "<S> the calculated @xmath58 values for @xmath3 nuclei follow nicely the average behavior , as it was also shown in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , even though relatively large fluctuations are present . </S>",
    "<S> these fluctuation may be due to dramatic changes in the mean field when going from the daughter ( @xmath59 ) system to the mother nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , they may be due to quite different deformation properties . </S>",
    "<S> an illustration of this is provided by the nucleus @xmath34be , which shows a deformed two-@xmath17-particle cluster structure while @xmath60be ( as well as the mirror nucleus @xmath60he ) is spherical . </S>",
    "<S> this is also the case for the nuclei @xmath38ne and @xmath41ti which are expected to gain additional binding due to the strong neutron - proton quadrupole correlation .    </S>",
    "<S> to illustrate the origin of the oes and the difference between different formulas , we start with the simple seniority model . for a system with @xmath61 identical particles in a single @xmath0-shell </S>",
    "<S> , the binding energy can be solved analytically in the seniority scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian for such a model can be written as @xcite , @xmath62 where @xmath63 represents the quasi - spin operator , and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are creation and annihilation operators . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 is the strength of the pairing interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the state with seniority @xmath66 can be written as @xmath67 if one assumes @xmath68 for the ground state of even - even system and @xmath69 for that of the odd system , the expression above can be simplified as @xmath70(j+1)g,\\\\ & = & \\left[\\frac{n}{2}\\right]\\left(\\left[\\frac{n}{2}\\right]-1\\right)g + \\delta_{v,1}\\left[\\frac{n}{2}\\right ] g+\\left[\\frac{n}{2}\\right]e_2\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 $ ] denotes the largest integer not exceeding n/2 and corresponds to the total number of @xmath68 pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear term in the equation above , which is proportional to @xmath72 or more exactly @xmath73\\left(\\left[\\frac{n}{2}\\right]-1\\right)$ ] , is related to the energy loss due to the pauli effect . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath74 term in above equation indicates the energy loss in the @xmath69 odd system due to the the particle ( pauli ) blocking effect : the unpaired particle blocks the scattering of other pairs to its own level . in practice </S>",

    "<S> this term is the one that contributes to the theoretical oes and for systems with even @xmath61 </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath76 it should be emphasized that a striking feature one thus finds is that the two blocking terms cancel each other in @xmath77 and they do not contribute to the pairing gap . a schematic picture is given in fig . [ sch ] to illustrate this point . </S>",
    "<S> however , as implied from the figure , this is not the case for @xmath78 for which one has , @xmath79 where the term @xmath80 is due to the superfluous contribution from the blocking effects . </S>",
    "<S> this unwanted term is the main origin of the differences between @xmath81 and @xmath10 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diff_gaps_subplot4 ] , in nuclei that can be well described within a single @xmath0 shell .    for non - degenerate systems the pairing collectivity manifests itself through the correlated contribution from many configurations , which is induced by the non - diagonal matrix elements of the pairing interaction in a shell - model context . for two particles in a non - degenerate system with a constant pairing </S>",

    "<S> all amplitudes @xmath85 contribute to the two - particle clustering with the same phase due to the strongly attractive nature of the pairing interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation energy induced by the monopole pairing corresponds to the difference @xmath86 where @xmath87 denotes the lowest orbital . as the gap @xmath88 increases the amplitude @xmath85 </S>",
    "<S> becomes more dispersed , resulting in stronger two - particle spatial correlation . </S>",
    "<S> this difference , or more exactly @xmath89 with the self energy removed , is an important measure of the two - particle spatial correlation at the surface , reflected in a corresponding clustering of the two nucleons forming the pair ( see , e.g. , ref . </S>",

    "<S> this clustering induces an increase in the strength of the corresponding pair - transfer reaction .    as an example , in fig . </S>",

    "<S> it contributes significantly to the oes and determines its evolutions as a function of pair number . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath93 is a parameter that is related to the pairing strength and level density . </S>",

    "<S> our calculations with the liquid drop model show that the average residual contributions are around -60 kev and -200 kev for neutron and proton pairing gaps , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the later case is dominated by a smooth contribution from the coulomb field . </S>",
    "<S> the main argument for the usage of @xmath101 instead is that the smooth non - linear terms in the binding energy can be canceled up to the fourth order @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that is , it removes the liquid - drop contribution to the oes to the largest extent . </S>",
    "<S> however , as mentioned in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the disadvantage is that the odd - even effects may be diminished as a result of the averaging over nuclei further apart .    </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath18 values for @xmath136ca are much smaller than those for nuclei in the @xmath137 shell . the pairing gap for @xmath133ca is expected to be even smaller . in the upper panel of fig . [ fig : twopar_subplot ] , following the same procedure as in ref . </S>",

    "<S> the nucleus @xmath144sn is within the dripline . </S>",
    "<S> the pairing tensors calculated from the three functional are quite close to each other . but as can be seen from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tincalcium2 ] , there is a significant difference between the theoretial mean gap @xmath121 and the oes from the theoretical binding energies . </S>",
    "<S> a similar deviation is also seen in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the origin for such a large deviation is not exactly known yet . </S>",
    "<S> it may be related to the fact that , for sn isotopes in this region , the chemical potential @xmath98 is pretty close to zero and the quasiparticle orbitals involved in the blocking calculations are all unbound . for such cases , </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical oes and gaps have to be carefully interpreted .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a noticeable kink at @xmath147 for tin isotopes which may be related to the occupancy of the low degeneracy orbital @xmath148 . </S>",
    "<S> a sudden drop occurs in the experimental pairing gaps in the sn isotopes when going from @xmath149 to @xmath150 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be reproduced by the hfb calculations with the volume and mixed pairing interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that drop is related to the reduced level density above n=82 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , there is a noticeable gap between the @xmath151 orbital and the higher- lying ones . which may result in a @xmath152 sub shell closure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced pairing collectivity in these nuclei can be clearly seen in the two - neutron spatial correlation plots given in the lower part of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : twopar_subplot ] , where we compared @xmath134sn , which have four holes in the core @xmath153sn , and @xmath135sn , with four particles above the core . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen from the figure , the peak in @xmath134sn is around one order of magnitude stronger than that in @xmath135sn .    </S>",
    "<S> hfb describes very well the pairing gap as well as the two - particle spatial correlation in open - shell nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> a known problem is that both the bcs and the hfb condensates collapse at closed shell , since in this case all orbitals are fully occupied ( c.f . , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 13 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , as the systematic calculations in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite shows , roughly 20 - 30% of the known nuclei contain collapsed bcs or hfb condensates . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore fair to affirm that the failure of these two approaches to reproduce the oes does not necessary mean that there is no pairing correlation in these nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> two typical examples are @xmath154ca and @xmath153sn shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : twopar_subplot ] . </S>",
    "<S> these two nuclei show @xmath47 values similar to neighboring nuclei below the closed shell . </S>",
    "<S> indeed our calculations with the seniority model @xcite show that the two - neutron spatial correlations in these two nuclei are as strong as those in neighboring ones . </S>",
    "<S> again , @xmath47 is a good indication of the two - neutron correlation in these cases . anyway , as mentioned above , comparisons between the theoretical gaps from even - even nuclei can only be compared with the empirical pairing gap in a semi - quantitative manner .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , in this paper we compared the pairing gaps derived from four different oes formulas . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that @xmath100 gauge very well the nuclear pairing correlation since it removes to a large extent the contribution from the single - particle structure of the nuclear mean field and the shell effect . </S>",
    "<S> it can serve as a reliable filter if one is primarily interested in evaluating the pairing effect in structure model calculations . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly interesting for the study of dripline nuclei since experimental data on those nuclei are usually scarce and show large fluctuations of shell structure . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , @xmath100 is expected to be less contaminated by the wigner effect for nuclei around @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that the strength of @xmath100 can be a good semi - quantative indication for the two - particle spatial correlation . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by our calculations with the hfb model with skyrme force as well as with the multi - shell seniority model . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we found that the weakening of @xmath4 in some neutron - rich nuclei indicates that the di - neutron correlation is weak in those nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> as examples , the pairing gaps and di - neutron spatial correlations in neutron - rich calcium and tin isotopes are evaluated in detail . </S>",
    "<S> calculations for the different pairing gaps and oes with different functional quantatively agree well with each other as well as with experimental data </S>",
    "<S> . however , these results need to be carefully examined when one approaches the dripline , where large deviations between different functionals and different definations of the pairing gaps may be seen . </S>"
