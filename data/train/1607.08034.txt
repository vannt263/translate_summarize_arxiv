    "in spite of its great success as a theory of gravity , general relativity ( gr ) has some alternative theories which come from various motivations .",
    "a most recent motivation certainly is the quest for a theoretical framework which can explain the present accelerated expansion of the universe without invoking any exotic matter field .",
    "the present interest in @xmath0 gravity also stems from the same motivation .",
    "an @xmath0 theory is one where the ricci scalar @xmath1 in the einstein - hilbert action is replaced by an analytic function of @xmath1 . for a comprehensive review of the motivation , various forms and applications of @xmath0 theories ,",
    "we refer to the work of sotiriou and faraoni@xcite . as a theory of gravity , @xmath0 theories warrant elaborate investigation in the context of local astronomical implications as well .",
    "in fact clifton and barrow@xcite showed that for an @xmath0 theory , the departure from general relativity has to be very small so as to be compatible with local astronomy .",
    "also quite often it is difficult to find a schwarzschild analogue@xcite as a stable solution .",
    "however , recently nzioki , goswami and dunsby showed that this latter problem is not generic and a schwarzschild solution is in fact a stable limit of a section of @xmath0 theories@xcite .",
    "+ the motivation of the present work is to look at the collapsing scenario in @xmath0 gravity in a spherically symmetric spacetime . gravitational collapse , by its own right , forms an important arena of research . a stellar object ,",
    "after it burns up its nuclear fuel , may not have sufficient pressure so as to balance the gravitational pull of its own mass and collapses to a tiny volume .",
    "the subject of interest is to check whether it collapses to a singularity , and if it does whether the singularity is hidden from an observer faraway by means of a horizon . in general relativity ,",
    "the theoretical study of a collapsing stellar object started with the work of oppenheimer and snyder@xcite , where the unhindered collapse of a perfect fluid with no pressure was discussed ( see also datt@xcite ) .",
    "the importance and various implications of gravitational collapse is reviewed recently by joshi .",
    "the technical aspects of collapse , particularly with a fluid , can be found in the monograph by joshi@xcite .",
    "+ although various aspects of @xmath0 gravity theories have been studied quite extensively , interest in collapsing models in such theories came into being quite recently .",
    "rigorous analytical investigation in this direction has been carried out very recently by goswami _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "this brings out some important results , for instance the existence of a regular horizon would require an inhomogeneity in the fluid distribution .",
    "very recently chakrabarti and banerjee@xcite investigated an @xmath0 gravity collapse in a spherically symmetric case where the metric coeffiecients were assumed to be separable function of the radial coordinate @xmath2 and the time coordinate @xmath3 ; the field equations yielded some restrictive domain of the validity as @xmath4 came out to be separable as well .",
    "the requirement of inhomogeneity is strongly supported in the latter work as well .",
    "the stability of collapsing models in @xmath0 theories has been investigated by sharif and yousaf@xcite .",
    "apart from these analytical work , numerical techniques have also been utilized in @xmath0 gravity collapse by borisov , jain and zhang@xcite and also by guo , wang and frolov@xcite .",
    "+ in the present work we start with a general form of @xmath0 , but eventually make an attempt to look for solutions for @xmath5 , for as general value of @xmath6 as possible .",
    "the equation system , obviously , is too difficult to handle analytically in general .",
    "we impose certain symmetry condition on the spacetime metric so as to arrive at some conclusions analytically .",
    "we impose the existence of a homothetic killing vector at the outset .",
    "this will definitely restrict the geometry , but keep alive the dependence on the radial coordinate @xmath2 which is indeed very much crucial in keeping the option open for a formation of horizon in the case of an ultimate singularity as a result of the collapse .",
    "the existence of a homothetic killing vector results in a simplification of the metric which has nicely been summarized and utilized by wagh and govinder@xcite .    in section 2",
    "we give a very brief description of a spherically symmetric spacetime admitting a homothetic killing vector .",
    "section 3 describes the formalism of a metric @xmath0 gravity .",
    "section 4 discusses the exact analytic collapsing solutions when @xmath0 is a power function of the ricci scalar @xmath1 in terms of gauss hypergeometric functions .",
    "the 5th section discusses the formation of singularity , the nature of the singularity and the possibility of the formation of an apparent horizon .",
    "the 6th section deals with the matching of the solutions obtained with an stable exterior metric .",
    "the last section summarizes the results obtained .",
    "a vector field @xmath7 is called a killing vector field if it satisfies the killing equation given as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the lie derivative operator along the vector field @xmath7 .",
    "the existence of a killing vector signifies a symmetry and hence a conserved quantity .",
    "for example , if a timelike killing vector exists for a particular metric , the energy is conserved .",
    "+ if the right hand side of equation ( [ killing ] ) is not zero but proportinal to @xmath10 , @xmath11 @xmath7 is called conformal killing vector . here",
    "@xmath12 is a function , called the conformal factor .",
    "the space time admits a conformal symmetry in this case .",
    "if @xmath12 is a constant , the vector @xmath7 is called homothetic killing vector . a spacetime admitting a homothetic killing vector is called self - similar , where one can have repetitive structures at various scales . with a conformal symmetry the angle between two curves remains the same and only the distance between two points are scaled by a factor depending on the spacetime points . for self - similarity , the scaling of the distance is a constant . +",
    "a spherically symmetric self - similar spacetime can be shown to admit a homothetic killing vector of the form    @xmath13    the choice of this form is not the general practice , which is rather like a choice as @xmath14 in a suitable coordinate system .",
    "one can show that with the choice of the homothetic killing vector as in ( [ homothety2 ] ) , the metric components are all separable functions of the radial coordinate @xmath2 and the time coordinate @xmath3 , and the metric is given by    @xmath15    and it admits a spacelike homothetic killing vector of the form @xmath16 . for a comprehensive discussion on this , we refer to the work of wagh and govinder@xcite .",
    "+ ricci scalar for the metric ( [ metric ] ) can be calculated to be @xmath17 where an overhead dot and a prime indicate differentiation with respect to time @xmath3 and the radial coordinate @xmath2 respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ricci scalar also turns out to be separable in functions of @xmath3 and @xmath2 for this class of spacetime line elements .",
    "in @xmath0 theories , the einstein - hilbert action of general relativity is modified by using a general analytic function @xmath0 instead of @xmath1 .",
    "the action is given by    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the lagrangian for the matter distribution .",
    "we work with the standard metric formulation where the action is varied with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "the variation of the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the metric tensor leads to the following partial differential equations as the field equations ,    @xmath21    where @xmath22 . writing this equation in the form of einstein tensor , one obtains @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the stress energy tensor for the matter distribution defined by @xmath19 and @xmath25 + @xmath26 represents the contribution of the curvature and",
    "may formally be treated as an effective stress - energy tensor with a purely geometrical origin . in the present work ,",
    "we take the stress - energy tensor for the matter part to be that of a perfect fluid which is given by @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 are the density and pressure of the fluid respectively and @xmath30 is the velocity four - vector of the fluid particles , which , being a timelike vector , can be normalized as @xmath31 .",
    "+ this theory is essentially a nonminimally coupled theory , the curvature related term @xmath32 couples with the matter sector @xmath24 nonminimally .",
    "from ( [ metric ] ) and ( [ fe ] ) , the @xmath34 equation yields @xmath35    from equation ( [ ricci ] ) , the derivative of the ricci scalar with respect to @xmath2 can be written in the form @xmath36    equations ( [ g01 ] ) and ( [ trick ] ) can be combined to yield @xmath37\\dot{r}=\\lambda(r)\\dot{r},\\ ] ] where @xmath38 depends solely on the choice of @xmath0 ( therefore on @xmath4 ) .",

    "equatuin ( [ trick2 ] ) simplifies to the form    @xmath42    here @xmath43 .",

    "but since @xmath0 gravity theories are nonminimally coupled theories , this indicates that there must be an exchange of energy between the matter and the curvature sector , and the latter drains the energy from the former during collapse , and diverges at the singularity .",

    "for the metric in the present case , this yields a simple result as @xmath99    with the help of the equation ( [ 1stint ] ) , this condition yields a constant @xmath53 corresponding to the apparent horizon in terms of @xmath6 as    @xmath100^{\\frac{(2n+1))}{4(2n-1)}}.\\ ] ]    amongst the examples worked out in the present work , the value of @xmath101 from equation ( [ app - hor - const ] ) comes out to be @xmath102 and @xmath103 for the last two cases respectively .",

    "so the singularities are well covered by a horizon . for a positive @xmath57",
    ", there is no respectable horizon , but there is no requirement of that either as the volume goes to zero only asymptotically . in a similar way , in all the three other examples , we have a horizon when it is relevant . in the present model , in all the cases",
    "it occurs , the singularity is independent of @xmath2 , and thus is not a central singularity .",
    "this kind of singularity is covered by a horizon@xcite .",
    "so the existence of the apparent horizon in all the relevant cases is quite a consistent result .",
    "the arbitrary function @xmath45 in ( [ bandr ] ) can be estimated from suitable matching of the solutions for the collapsing fluid with that of a vacuum exterior geometry at the boundary .",
    "generally , in collapsing models , the interior is matched at a boundary hypersurface with a vacuum schwarzschild exterior , which requires the continuity of both the metric and the extrinsic curvature on the boundary hypersurface ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , in f(r)-theories of gravity , continuity of the ricci scalar across the boundary surface and continuity of its normal derivative are also required ( @xcite ) .",
