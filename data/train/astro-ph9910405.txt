    "starburst galaxies provide unique opportunities to study rapid phases of galactic evolution .",
    "the wisconsin starburst project focuses on nearby ultraviolet - bright starbursts selected from the spectrophotometric sample of gallagher et al .",
    "they resemble intermediate redshift ( @xmath1 0.5 - 1 ) `` compact narrow emission line galaxies '' ( cnelgs , e.g. guzeman et al .",
    "1998 ) in terms of their small sizes , blue luminosities , and [ oii ] emission line equivalent widths ; e.g. , m@xmath218 , and ew([oii ] ) @xmath3 25   with @xmath40.2 .",
    "our strategy is based on the analysis of multi - band imaging and area spectroscopy obtained with the wiyn 3.5-m telescope and high angular resolution wfpc2 and foc _ hst _ images .",
    "images provide global morphologies , colors , and the small scale structures of star - forming sites .",
    "spectra from the wiyn densepak multi - fiber array are used to measure global velocity fields in the ionized gas ( eg . ,",
    "homeier & gallagher 1999 ; hg99 ) .",
    "interactions are well - established starburst triggers . because of the huge range of possible interaction parameters , we expect and observe considerable variance in the responses of galaxies to interactions .",
    "our emphasis is on weak interactions , such as minor mergers , or mild collisions , in which at least one member of the colliding pair survives with its initial structure relatively intact .",
    "the signatures of recent galaxy interactions are well - known , and in the optical include : luminous tails of tidal debris , or ripples in post - interaction systems .",
    "these features often have low surface brightnesses and/or small angular sizes ; imaging with telescopes like wiyn , that combine excellent surface brightness sensitivity with good angular resolution ( 0.7 arcsec seeing ) , is valuable for determining the structures of these types of systems .",
    "the signposts of interactions evolve on galaxy orbital time scales of @xmath510@xmath6  yr with infall of tidal debris possibly continuing for @xmath510@xmath7  yr ; after this , evidence of a collision will be difficult to detect .",
    "starbursts are found from their prominent populations of high mass stars , which are the products of upward spikes in star formation rates .",
    "this is obvious when the starburst is optically visible , and gives rise to high surface brightnesses , blue optical colors , and strong emission lines .",
    "starbursts also produce supergiant hii complexes , massive and compact `` super star clusters '' , and the peculiar kpc - scale `` clumps '' of ob stars , whose existence was emphasized more than 20 years ago by j. heidmann and collaborators as symptoms of ` hyperactive star formation ' . while the evolutionary time scales of individual star - forming complexes within starbursts are not well known , data from m82 suggest this occurs in less than 10@xmath6  yr ( satyapal et al .",
    "1997 ; gallagher & smith 1999 ) .",
    "the internal structure of a starburst evolves more quickly than structural perturbations induced by the dynamical influence of a colliding galaxy .",
    "the optical structures of four luminous starbursts within 100  mpc provide some examples of star formation produced in a variety of collisions :    * markarian 8 * is a strongly interacting system ( figure 1 ) .",
    "it apparently consists of two small disk galaxies .",
    "our wfpc2 images show one of these to be strongly disturbed , while the other remains an organized , coplanar system ( gallagher et al .",
    "both objects have high inclinations , but the system still has blue colors and strong [ oii ] emission .    *",
    "haro 1 * , a nearly face - on galaxy , can be seen in figure 2 to be experiencing a weak interaction with a dwarf companion . even though only mild optical distortions are present in haro 1 , it is in a late phase of an intense starburst ( the integrated spectrum shows strong balmer absorptions ) .    * ngc 3310 * is one of the nearest examples of a luminous uv - bright starburst and has been extensively studied in the optical and ir and mapped in hi .",
    "the starburst probably was caused by a minor merger ( mulder et al .",
    "1995 , conselice et al .",
    "large scale organization of star formation in ngc  3310 is located in a nearly symmetric two - arm spiral pattern , and around a mildly distorted circum - nuclear ring , as shown in the color map in figure 2 .",
    "evidently a strong starburst was initiated with little collisional disruption to the surviving gas - rich disk galaxy , seen at low inclination .",
    "* ngc 7673 * , an archetypical ` clumpy irregular ' , has a highly disturbed inner structure dominated by four huge star - forming complexes ( figure 2 ) . wfpc2",
    "optical and uv imaging resolve the clumps into clusters of compact star clusters , similar to conditions in m82 ( oconnell et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the clumps are located within a faint , relatively symmetric outer disk that also contains a faint stellar arc , or ripple ( hg99 ) .",
    "this starburst is a remnant of a past interaction with ngc  7678 ( nordgren et al .",
    "1997 ) , or a minor merger .",
    "hg99 measured the h@xmath8 velocity field of ngc  7673 with wiyn using the densepak array .",
    "they found that the inner part of the galaxy is almost exactly face - on and dynamically cold .",
    "the wings of the line are broadened ; most likely by gas outflows from the disk , and the integrated h@xmath8 line profile closely resembles those observed in cnelgs by guzman et al .",
    "however , in this case we know that we are _ not _ seeing a spheroidal system in formation , but rather a nearly face - on disk .",
    "our data demonstrate the production of intense starbursts in weak interactions in which at least one of the original disks survives .",
    "one channel for the production of compact luminous galaxies therefore modifies rather than destroys stellar disks , and some post - starburst systems will be small disk galaxies .",
    "disk geometries introduce a prejudice for optically- or uv- bright starbursts to be seen at low inclinations where disk obscuration is minimized .",
    "m82 is a nearby example ; from our perspective it is an ir - starburst , but the brilliant uv reflection nebula seen above the disk in focas images imply that when seen at low inclination , m82 is a uv - bright starburst .",
    "this is a statistical trend ; some galaxies , such as markarian 8 or chain galaxies at moderate redshifts , are blue and inclined .",
    "a bias to select blue starbursts in low inclination disks will also lead to narrow velocity line widths in integrated optical spectra ; these are not necessarily signatures of low mass dwarf galaxies .",
    "our data do not show a simple relationship between the stage of an interaction and starburst properties ; intense starbursts occur in both the ongoing markarian 8 and very late ngc  7673 interactions .",
    "this complicates our ability to distinguish collisionally induced starbursts , since the clear signatures of an ongoing interaction may not be present during the peak starburst phase .",
    "this problem is especially severe when dealing with faint blue galaxies at moderate redshifts , where information is often sparse ( ellis 1997 ) .",
    "a simple model assumes that luminous blue starbursts take place in gas - rich late - type disk galaxies that remain as disks after the event .",
    "many nearby starbursts are rich in hi and have the fuel to support post - burst star - formation",
    ". these types of post - burst objects would be less easily distinguished than extreme cases where star formation is truncated after a burst , giving rise to distinctive ` e @xmath9 a ' spectra .",
    "the ingredients of our simple recipe for luminous starbursts follows :    \\1 .",
    "store gas in a dynamically cold , low density disk .",
    "such disks are excellent storage places to keep gas as they have low intrinsic rates of evolution , and populations of such thin , cold disk galaxies exist at the current epoch ( matthews et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "perturb the disk with an interaction ; a merger with a galaxy having 10% or less of the total mass , or even a near miss from a comparable or larger neighbor should suffice .",
    "what we require is that gas be driven to the central few kpc of the disk where it can support intense star formation .",
    "gas transport can be produced directly by the perturber , or indirectly through production of a bar .",
    "wait a few gyr until done .",
    "the result may be a late - type system with a moderately thick stellar disk , a product of collisional disk heating during the interaction ( reshetnikov & combes 1997 ) .",
    "the interaction also could produce an off - center bar , yielding a magellanic irregular .",
    "this channel for making magellanic systems is observationally suggested by the preference for such galaxies to have companions ( odewahn 1994 ) and theoretical models that produce characteristic off - center bars during collisions ( levine & sparke 1998 ) .    the wisconsin exploration of starburst galaxies has been supported as part of the wfpc2 investigation team s research program .",
    "we are also pleased to acknowledge support through general observer space telescope grant , and from a vilas associateship award to jsg ."
