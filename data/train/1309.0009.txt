    "transiting exoplanets provide invaluable information on planetary physics , their formation , and evolution .",
    "the search for planets in the habitable zone has so far focused on solar - type stars and m dwarfs .",
    "however , transiting planets in the habitable zone around white dwarfs ( wds ) may be common and they may provide our best chance to detect biomarkers on an exoplanet in the near future @xcite .",
    "wds are as common as sun - like stars , and they provide an energy source for planets for billions of years .",
    "typical wds have @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , so a planet must orbit at @xmath40.01 au to be at a temperature for liquid water to exist on its surface .",
    "the habitable zone around wds extends from 0.005 au ( p = 4",
    "h ) to 0.02 au ( p = 30 h , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for wds older than about 1 gyr .",
    "figure [ fig : agol ] shows the evolution of the habitable zone around wds ( wdhz ) with time .",
    "a planet enters at the bottom of figure [ fig : agol ] and moves vertically up the figure as its wd host ages , so it starts off too hot for liquid water , passes through the wdhz , and then becomes too cold .",
    "the duration a planet spends within the wdhz has a maximum of 8 gyr at 0.01 au ; wds have long - lived habitable zones .",
    "we expect the planets within 1 au of solar type stars to be destroyed in the giant phase ( * ? ? ?",
    "* but see silvotti et al .",
    "hence , planets in the habitable zone around wds must arrive there after this phase .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite describe several ways to form such planets near the wd or bring them closer .",
    "planets can form out of gas near the wd , via the interaction or merger of binary stars @xcite , or by capture or migration from larger distances .",
    "planets have been detected around evolved , post - main - sequence stars , including millisecond pulsars and pulsar + wd systems @xcite .",
    "@xcite have a dynamical instability model that can produce short period planets on gyr timescales ; the same mechanism is likely at work after the giant phases and could populate the habitable zone around wds .",
    "the discovery of close - in planets around the post - main - sequence stars kic 05807616 and v391 pegasi demonstrate that such planets should also exist around wds @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have emphasized that the tidal heating of a planet , until it achieves full circularization , in the wdhz would lead to the loss of water .",
    "however , the young earth was also a hot and dry place , but volatiles and water were then delivered to it by a large number of comets .",
    "it is likely that the process that populates the wd habitable zone could also lead to a heavy bombardment phase that could deliver water and volatiles to these planets @xcite .",
    "about 30% of the wds in the solar neighborhood have metal - polluted atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the source of metals is not accretion from the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath54.3% of wds host debris disks",
    "@xcite , which are the remnants of tidally destroyed asteroids and planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , there is direct evidence from these debris disks that the interactions between giant planets can send asteroids , moons , or small ( earth - like ) planets closer to the wd @xcite . therefore , short - period planets around wds likely exist ; but we have never looked at enough wds to find them .",
    "wds are about the same size as earth .",
    "hence , earth - size ( and even smaller ) planets can easily be detected through photometric observations @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : eclipse ] shows model light - curves of a 0.6 @xmath6 wd as it is eclipsed by a planet with @xmath7 and another with @xmath8 orbiting in the habitable zone of the wd . in the case",
    "of the 1 @xmath9 planet , the eclipse produces a reduction in flux of 50% , whereas a 10 @xmath9 super - earth would effectively block out the wd completely .",
    "it is this high contrast ratio between the planet and the host wd that makes it possible to obtain an atmospheric transmission spectrum of planets in the wdhz with future telescopes , like the james webb space telescope ( jwst , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most prominent biomarker on earth , molecular oxygen ( o@xmath10 ) , can be detected in the transmission spectrum of an earth - like planet orbiting wds ( see fig . 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to detect these 2-min long transits",
    ", one must monitor at high cadence a large sample of wds for the duration of the orbital period at 0.02 au ( @xmath11 h ) . assuming random inclinations ,",
    "the transit probability is roughly 1% for earth - size planets . to measure @xmath12 ,",
    "the frequency of earth - like planets , to an accuracy of 33% requires detecting 9 planets , so one must survey @xmath13 wds .",
    "similarly , @xcite argue that a survey of at least 500 wds is required to detect transiting planets around them . for values of @xmath1410% ,",
    "more stars must be observed to detect planets , so the best strategy is to observe multiple wds simultaneously with a wide - field imager .",
    "given the unknown frequency of exoplanets in the wdhz , a survey of @xmath15 wds would be essential in constraining the frequency and types of planets in the wdhz .    a ground - based telescope with a modest field of view ( less than a couple sq .",
    "deg . ) would have to observe the stars one at a time .",
    "so @xmath1 wds would require 2 - 4@xmath16 days ( including overhead ) , or about 100 years . for comparison",
    ", kepler can perform the same survey in 200 days .",
    "there are no planned or ongoing surveys that will accomplish the survey requirements ; 30 h long observations of @xmath15 wds with 1 - 2 min cadence .",
    "the transiting exoplanet survey satellite ( tess ) is not sensitive enough to perform a transit survey for a large number of wds .",
    "there are also no ground - based telescopes with sufficient aperture size and wide field - of - view to perform a survey of @xmath1 wds and to obtain continuous coverage over 2 days .",
    "for example , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) and gaia @xcite surveys will obtain 50 to 1000 epochs of observations over a decade , possibly detecting one epoch in eclipse for a few per cent of the wds with transiting planets .",
    "these surveys will be biased toward detecting shorter period and larger planets that have yet to enter the wdhz .",
    "in addition , confirmation of the planets around many of the faint lsst wds will be challenging . on the other hand ,",
    "the transits detected in our proposed kepler survey can be easily followed - up with ground - based telescopes and , most importantly , with the jwst .",
    "kepler in the 2-wheels mode provides an unprecedented opportunity to perform a photometric survey that is capable of finding the first exoplanets in the wdhz .",
    "thanks to its sky coverage and depth , for the first time , kepler can image a large number of wds at the same time and search for transiting planets and other substellar or stellar companions .",
    "the majority of the known wds are in the sdss fields .",
    "hence , kepler imaging of the known wds in the sdss fields provides the best opportunity for such a transit survey .",
    "there are @xmath17 spectroscopically confirmed wds in the sdss dr7 area @xcite .",
    "we have identified an additional @xmath18 wds in the same area through proper motion measurements using the sdss + usno - b astrometry @xcite . even though many of these targets lack spectroscopy data , @xcite",
    "demonstrate that this sample is almost pure , with a contamination rate from subdwarfs of 1% .",
    "overall , there are @xmath19 unique wds currently known in 11,663 sq .",
    "deg . of imaging in the sdss dr7 area .",
    "figure [ fig : sdss ] shows the magnitude and color distribution of these targets .",
    "there are @xmath13 and @xmath1 wds with @xmath20 mag and @xmath21 mag , respectively .",
    "the latter include 2253 cool wds with @xmath22 k. we propose a kepler imaging survey of the @xmath1 sdss wds brighter than @xmath21 mag to discover stellar , substellar , and planetary ( including sub - earth - and - up companions ) around all wds .",
    "this survey will measure the planetary frequency and survival around both young and old systems and discover planets in the wdhz .",
    "thanks to the sdss astrometry , accurate positions are known for each target and target apertures can be defined easily . the limiting factor for kepler observations of faint sources",
    "is set by source confusion , rather than the photometric accuracy .",
    "all of our targets have sdss imaging down to @xmath23 mag , and the usno - b+sdss proper motion catalog @xcite avoids sources with nearby background sources within @xmath24 .",
    "hence , source confusion is not a problem for our targets .",
    "the proposed survey will image each field for 2 days , with 1 min cadence .",
    "this survey will be sensitive to planets within 0.03 au of the stars .",
    "imaging the dr7 area requires about 100 pointings .",
    "hence , the entire survey can be done over 200 days .",
    "the nominal kepler mission provided @xmath450 ppm photometry for a 12 mag g2v star integrated over 30 minutes , enabling discoveries of earth - like planets around main - sequence stars . given the pointing problems in the 2-wheels mode , the image will be spread out over more pixels , and the increased read noise and larger responsivity variations will reduce the photometric precision to @xmath40.3 - 1% .",
    "given the eclipse signature of earth - size and larger planets around wds ( see figure [ fig : eclipse ] ) , the systematic errors due to the pointing problems is not the limiting factor for wdhz observations . instead , the brightness of the target wds limits the delivered photometric precision .",
    "kepler can obtain 1% photometry for targets brighter than about 16.5 mag , and 10% photometry for targets brighter than 18.7 mag .",
    "hence , the 50% eclipse signature of an earth - like planet can be detected at @xmath25 for targets as faint as 18.7 mag .",
    "it may be possible to obtain photometry of the fainter targets in the same fields by using a smaller number of pixels for computing the light curve .",
    "figure [ fig : sdss ] shows that the number of objects rises dramatically between @xmath26 and 20 mag .",
    "hence , the number of targets can easily be doubled by a @xmath40.5 mag deeper survey ; operational testing of the 2-wheels mode is necessary to decide on the limiting magnitude for such observations .",
    "kepler can effectively search for transiting earth - size planets around @xmath1 wds in the sdss . with its unprecedented photometric sensitivity",
    ", kepler could also detect smaller occulting objects down to the scale of the earth s moon , albeit with lower significance .",
    "in addition to planetary companions , kepler will also be sensitive to short period substellar and stellar companions",
    ". this sample will be essentially complete to @xmath27 d. however , eclipsing systems with longer periods will also be detected .",
    "about 22% of field wds have late - type main - sequence star companions @xcite , while 3.4% of these systems are eclipsing with @xmath28 day orbits @xcite .",
    "hence , the frequency of eclipsing wd + m dwarf binaries is likely around 0.75% . in a sample of @xmath1 wds , we are likely to find 75 eclipsing wd + m dwarf binaries .",
    "earth - density planets will not survive at orbital periods shorter than 4 h. hence , eclipses with @xmath29 h are almost certainly from stellar or brown dwarf companions .",
    "given the differences in size , the eclipse signatures of wd + earth - size planets and wd + stellar binaries would be significantly different and easy to distinguish based on the light - curves .",
    "in addition , follow - up near - infrared photometry and optical radial velocity observations of the eclipsing systems can easily distinguish between planetary companions and brown dwarf or stellar companions .",
    "stellar binaries will show primary and secondary eclipses of different depths in different filters , offset secondary eclipses due to light travel time , gravitational lensing @xcite , and doppler beaming @xcite .",
    "these systems would provide stringent constraints on the mass - radius relations for wds and late - type m dwarfs , and also age - activity relation for the latter .",
    "it is widely accepted that sne ia are caused by the thermonuclear explosion of wds @xcite , but the nature of the progenitor binary systems is not settled . until we find the progenitors , it is impossible to understand the systematic uncertainties and to optimize sne ia for precision cosmology .",
    "the sne ia progenitor problem is therefore a key problem in astronomy today @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies suggest that sub - chandrasekhar mass wd systems may also form sne ia ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "major contenders for sn ia progenitors are mergers of binary wds .",
    "discovering and quantifying the population properties of close double wds , including co+co and co+he binary wd systems , can provide key insights into the sne ia progenitor problem @xcite .",
    "there are currently four eclipsing double wd systems known with orbital periods ranging from 12.75 min @xcite to 5.9 h @xcite .",
    "the lack of eclipsing systems at longer orbital periods is a selection effect due to the difficulty of observing a target for longer than 6 h a night .",
    "the proposed kepler imaging survey will identify all of the eclipsing double wd merger systems among our targets , thanks to the 2 day long observations .",
    "these eclipses last 2 - 3 min , and include total eclipses for similar mass wds . based on a population synthesis model for binary stars ,",
    "@xcite predict a frequency of 2.5% for double wds with @xmath30 h. our proposed survey will provide the first constraints on the frequency of eclipsing double wds and their merger rate .",
    "eclipsing double wds provide the most accurate constraints on the masses and radii of each target .",
    "this will in turn provide the mass distribution and merger times for each system and constrain the contribution of the double degenerate channel to sne ia .",
    "this project may finally provide direct evidence for or against the double degenerate channel for sne ia .",
    "the shortest period binary wds are also excellent gravitational wave sources .",
    "the gravitational wave radiation and the orbital decay in the shortest period systems may be detected directly by space based missions like the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) and indirectly by ground based observations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite lists 12 ultra - compact systems that are guaranteed lisa sources , but predicts that lisa should detect at least several hundred systems .",
    "double wds in the galaxy outnumber all other known types of gravitational wave sources and they form a gravitational wave foreground",
    ". some of the eclipsing systems found in the proposed kepler survey will be amongst the strongest gravitational wave sources known . with accurate positions , masses , and distance estimates",
    ", these will be verification sources for gravitational wave missions in the milli - hertz range ( e.g. , elisa , * ? ? ?",
    "wds go through the dov , dbv , and dav instability strips as they evolve .",
    "the zz ceti ( dav ) stars are the most common type of pulsators , with @xmath4150 currently known .",
    "davs are found in a very well defined region in the @xmath31 plane .",
    "they exhibit pulsation periods in the range 100 - 1400 s , corresponding to low - degree gravity - mode oscillations .",
    "the detected pulsation modes have amplitudes ranging from a few millimagnitudes to a fraction of a magnitude ( @xmath410% ) .",
    "the cooler pulsators tend to show longer periods and larger amplitudes . also , for a given effective temperature",
    ", the observed periods tend to be longer for lower gravity objects @xcite .",
    "high speed photometric studies of the pulsating wds enable us to constrain the structure and evolutionary timescales of wds .",
    "for example , the pulsation modes and amplitudes are sensitive to the thickness of the surface h and he layers , the depth of the convection zone , and the degree of crystallization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there are @xmath41500 wds with @xmath3212,000 k in our proposed kepler survey .",
    "these wds are in the right temperature range to pulsate as a dav .",
    "kepler will be sensitive to large amplitude pulsations , and as a bonus , it will provide a magnitude - limited sample of pulsators . with 2 d coverage , the majority of the modes can be identified , and the most interesting targets can be followed up from the ground for further characterization and theoretical modeling of the structure of each star .",
    "kepler will significantly increase the number of known pulsating wds and change this field dramatically .",
    "before the discovery of hot jupiters around main - sequence stars , our view of planet formation was very different . the discovery of hot jupiters was unexpected and unintentional .",
    "here we outlined an alternate mission for kepler in the 2-wheels mode targeting a large sample of wds to find the first planets in the habitable zone . if the history of exoplanet science has taught us anything , it is that planets are ubiquitous and they exist in the most unusual places , including very close to their host stars and even around pulsars @xcite",
    ". currently there are no known planets around wds , but we have never looked at a sufficient number of wds at high cadence to find them through transit observations .",
    "it is essentially impossible to find earth - jupiter size planets around wds by any other method @xcite .",
    "if habitable planets exist around wds , the proposed kepler imaging survey will find them .",
    "biomarkers , including o@xmath10 , on such planets can be detected with the jwst .",
    "hence , even though this is a completely unexplored search area for transiting planets , the scientific yield of the proposed survey will be enormous .",
    "in addition to the planetary studies , the proposed survey will also dramatically change the field of short period binary wds , including eclipsing double wds , wd + m dwarfs , and wd + brown dwarfs .",
    "this survey will constrain the merger rate and mass distribution of double wds , which is important for binary population synthesis studies , understanding sne ia explosions , and identifying new verification binaries and the galactic foreground in gravitational waves .",
    "short cadence targets are limited to no more than 512 across the entire focal plane .",
    "our proposed survey has a density of @xmath33 short cadence targets per pointing .",
    "therefore , this survey can be combined with other projects targeting the sdss fields .",
    "for example , similar high ( or low ) cadence observations of m dwarfs ( e.g. , the mearth project , * ? ? ? * ) or other types of ( variable ) stars in the sdss fields can be obtained simultenously .",
    "nearby m dwarfs can be easily selected based on their high proper motion from the sdss + usno - b positions @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the sdss photometry can be used to select a nearly complete and contamination free sample of variable stars like rr lyrae over the entire sdss footprint .",
    "the survey can also be extended to an all - sky survey through the selection of wds from other proper motion surveys like the usno - b , supercosmos @xcite , and lspm @xcite .",
    "if this survey is not selected as the primary mission for kepler in the 2-wheels mode , it should at least be considered as a filler project for other surveys .",
