    "the abundance of clusters of galaxies is known to evolve at redshifts @xmath8 , and this time dependence can be used to constrain cosmological models ( e.g. , carlberg et al .  1997 ; bahcall , fan , & cen 1997 ; bartelmann et al .",
    "but the nature of clustering at redshifts @xmath9 , where the contrast between model predictions is much more pronounced , is largely unknown . while qso absorption systems show clustering ( e.g. , heisler , hogan & white 1989 ; lanzetta , webb , & barcons 1995 ; fernndez - soto et al .",
    "1996 ) , and while there is recent indication of large - scale structure at high redshift ( steidel et al .",
    "1998 ; adelberger et al .  1998",
    "; giavalisco et al .",
    "1998 ) , the identification of specific groups and clusters is rather tentative ( dressler et al .  1993",
    "; giavalisco , steidel & szalay 1994 ; pascarelle et al .",
    "1996a ; hu & macmahon 1996 ; francis et al .",
    "1996 ; lefvre et al .  1996 ; warren & mller 1996 ; malkan , teplitz , & mclean 1996 ; dickinson 1997 ; stanford et al .",
    "1997 ) , and to date no rich cluster has been definitively detected at redshift @xmath10 .",
    "one tracer of a possible distant cluster is a cosmic microwave background decrement ( cmbd ) , which is most plausibly due to inverse compton scattering by intracluster plasma ( sunyaev and zeldovich 1972 ) .",
    "two such cmbds without identified optical clusters have recently been reported at 1312 + 4237 ( richards et al .",
    "1997 ) and 1643 + 4631 ( jones et al .",
    "1997 ) . the absence of x - ray flux detection in deep rosat images can be used to set lower limits for the redshifts of intervening clusters .",
    "kneissl , sunyaev , & white ( 1998 ) found @xmath11 and @xmath12 at the 95% confidence level for the redshifts of 10-kev isothermal objects of any size along the lines of sight to 1312 + 4237 and 1643 + 4631 , respectively .",
    "intriguingly , both cmbds are in the direction of qso pairs at redshifts @xmath13 for 1312 + 4237 ( windhorst et al .  1995 ) and @xmath14 and @xmath15 for 1643 + 4631 ( schneider , schmidt , & gunn 1991 ) .",
    "the differing redshifts for the 1643 + 4631 qsos ( corresponding to a rest - frame velocity difference of 2500 ) and the large separations ( 90  and 200  for 1312 + 4237 and 1643 + 4631 , respectively ) argue against gravitational lensing by intervening clusters , so it is possible that the clusters are at the redshifts of the qsos .    with this in mind , we searched a field of @xmath1 around 1312 + 4237 for objects",
    "whose medium - band imaging shows enhanced emission centered at 4350 .",
    "we found 56 such objects ( in addition to the two previously known qsos ) and interpret them as -emitting candidates ( lecs ) at redshift @xmath16 .",
    "we have confirmed the redshifts of three of the brightest new lecs ( one of which is a qso ) , with redshifts between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "a grey - scale image of the 1312 + 4237 field , with all the lecs and the cmbd marked , is shown in figure [ image ] .",
    "data for all the objects with existing spectroscopy are given in table 1 .",
    "images of 1312 + 4237 in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands ( harris set ) were obtained in 1997 april with the prime focus camera of the kpno 4 m telescope ( fov @xmath19 , pixel size 047 ) .",
    "five dithered exposures of 15 minutes each were taken in each band under photometric conditions with an average seeing of 12 . in order to select the lecs",
    ", the field was also imaged using a medium - band filter , @xmath20 , centered at @xmath21 .",
    "( hereafter we use @xmath22 to designate both the filter and the associated magnitude . ) a total of sixteen dithered 30-minute exposures were obtained , giving continuum depth comparable to the @xmath17 images .",
    "all images were reduced using standard iraf procedures , with magnitudes measured by the _ phot _",
    "routine in apertures of 6-pixel radius . in order to reduce photometric color errors ,",
    "the @xmath17 and the @xmath22 magnitudes were both calibrated against the same exposures of landolt ( 1992 ) standards in @xmath17 .",
    "the zero - point difference between the magnitudes , calibrated separately with the landolt standards , showed a perfectly linear relation , with an _ rms _ calibration error of 0.04 mag .",
    "color errors were determined by adding in quadrature magnitude errors .",
    "the sextractor program ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) was used for automatic source identification ; source confusion is not a problem at these magnitudes .",
    "the presence of a bright star at the east of the field forced the removal of around 30% of the image .",
    "a total of 3772 objects with @xmath23 were detected in the remaining field of about @xmath24 .",
    "we determined the galaxy catalogue to be complete to @xmath25 and @xmath26 by comparing with published galaxy counts ( e.g. , metcalfe et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram , @xmath27 ( iraf aperture photometry ) versus @xmath28 ( sextractor `` best''-magnitude ) , is shown in figure [ cm ] for all the galaxies detected in the image with magnitudes @xmath29 and photometric color errors @xmath30 mag .",
    "the most noticeable feature of the diagram is the number of galaxies with excess color @xmath27 .",
    "the traditional method of identifying emission - line candidates has been to seek objects with color excesses exceeding @xmath31 or @xmath32 , where the standard deviation includes both the intrinsic spread and the observational errors ( pascarelle et al .",
    "1996b ; cowie & hu 1998 ) . but the distribution of observed colors is not gaussian : _ intrinsic _ colors are skewed toward negative @xmath27 , as can be seen in figure [ cm ] for galaxies with @xmath33 , for which the sample is complete and observational errors are negligible , and incompleteness at faint magnitudes affects negative @xmath27 first , since the sample was selected in @xmath17 . in order to avoid a complicated selection criterion , we apply a fixed color cut and designate as lecs all objects with @xmath34 and color errors @xmath30 .",
    "( the median color errors , after eliminating those exceeding 0.2 , are 0.11 and 0.16 mag for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively . ) to verify the effectiveness of this cut , we used a variety of evolutionary models ( campos 1997 ) , convolved with the actual photometric color errors , to show that , without excess line emission , the number of galaxies expected to have color excess @xmath34 is very small compared with the number observed . as an example",
    ", the expectation in an @xmath37 @xmath38 model is for less than one galaxy in the magnitude range @xmath39 to satisfy the color cutoff , @xmath34 , and for only 3 galaxies to do so for @xmath40 , while we found 16 and 39 objects , respectively , with colors exceeding that limit .",
    "our color criterion , @xmath34 , corresponds to an observed equivalent width over a flat spectrum exceeding 120 . at the @xmath25 completeness limit of our catalogue",
    "this translates to a line flux of @xmath41 erg @xmath42 s@xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "there are 37 lecs above this limit , or a surface density of @xmath45 .",
    "this lec surface density is similar to that found by steidel et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for normal star - forming galaxies at redshifts @xmath46 .",
    "there are 3 objects in the field with magnitudes @xmath47 and a clear excess of emission in the @xmath22 band ( see figure [ cm ] ) .",
    "two of the objects , q1 and q2 , are the previously known @xmath48jy qsos ( windhorst et al .",
    "1995 ) . the third object , with similar @xmath27 and intermediate @xmath17 magnitude , was observed at the mmt in 1998 february with a dispersion of 1.95 / pixel and nominal resolution of 7.1 and found to be another qso at redshift @xmath2 .",
    "its spectrum is shown in figure [ q3 ] .",
    "the other lecs are all fainter , @xmath49 .",
    "we tried to confirm their redshifts in another spectroscopic follow - up in 1998 march , using the ldss-2 multi - slit spectrograph at the wht 4 m telescope at la palma observatory with a dispersion of 5.3 / pixel and nominal resolution of 13.3 .",
    "inclement weather allowed us to obtain workable spectra for only 2 objects , g1 and g2 .",
    "both of them show lines in their spectra that , if identified with , imply redshifts of @xmath3 and @xmath50 , respectively . their spectra are plotted in figure [ gals ] .",
    "note that both galaxies show little or no emission shortward of the putative  line and continuum longward of the line , consistent with a -forest interpretation . with our signal - to - noise ratio and resolution",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that they are also active galaxies . in three other objects with @xmath51",
    "we could barely detect continua but no lines .",
    "one object close to g1 in the color - magnitude diagram , figure [ cm ] , but with @xmath52 , was not detected at all .",
    "the spectroscopic confirmation rate is similar to the one in the 53w002 field of pascarelle et al .",
    "( 1996b ) .",
    "in the 1312 + 4237 field under analysis@xmath1 around two known qsos at redshift @xmath13 and a cosmic microwave background decrement ( cmbd)we have found 56 new -emitting candidates ( lecs ) at redshift @xmath16 .",
    "three of the new lecs now have confirmed redshifts ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ; one of them is another qso at @xmath6 .",
    "it is unlikely that the excess emission in the as yet unconfirmed lecs is due to another line , for example [ oii]@xmath53 at redshift @xmath54 .",
    "first ,  was not observed at the expected wavelengths in the spectra of g1 and g2 ( dotted lines in figure [ gals ] ) .",
    "second , at redshift @xmath54 the galaxies would be starbursting dwarfs with @xmath55 , w[oii]@xmath56 , and density @xmath57 . for any cosmology , the space density of such a population implied by our observation would far exceed that observed heretofore ( e.g. , campos 1997 ) .",
    "moreover , many of the lecs are red ( 31 with colors @xmath58 ) , while starbursting dwarfs are expected to be blue , @xmath59 .",
    "the lecs are scattered throughout the observed field of @xmath60 , corresponding to proper lengths of @xmath61 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 and a factor of 1.5 smaller if @xmath62 .",
    "virialized clusters at the present epoch are somewhat smaller , but some of the lecs may also belong to a surrounding supercluster and not be part of a virialized cluster . for non - virialized objects , such as protoclusters and filaments , the relevant scales can be as high as the comoving dimensions of the field , @xmath63 , corresponding to present - day large - scale structure . using the same medium - band imaging technique at 4100 , pascarelle , windhorst , & keel ( 1998 ) find densities ranging from @xmath64 in four fields complete to a depth of 25 mag , three of which were randomly chosen .",
    "multiplying our surface density of @xmath45 by a factor of 1.4 to bring it to the same completeness level , we find it to be in mid - range .",
    "the galaxian density may not reflect the underlying mass density , however .",
    "reported biasing factors at high redshifts range from high ( adelberger et al .",
    "1998 ) to extreme ( mannucci et al .  1998 ) .",
    "four of the five spectroscopically confirmed objects actually form a 3  filament with a rest - frame velocity dispersion of 1000  located near the cmbd , and the cmbd possibly extends ne across it ( windhorst et al .",
    "1995 , figure 1 ) .",
    "( q3 is 10  away and has a relative velocity of 4500 . )",
    "moreover , five lecs with @xmath65 , including g2 , are within 0.7  of q1 at the nw end of the filament .",
    "since only half the lecs have @xmath66 , their mean surface density in the field is @xmath67 , and the probability for such a clustering to be random is @xmath68 .",
    "this probability need not be viewed as completely _ a posteriori _ , since q1 is by far the brightest lec in the field and may well point to the location of the cluster ( but note that some of the lecs may be due to the qso itself , cf . , natarajan , sigurdsson , & silk 1998 ) .",
    "deeper imaging might reveal more structure , but spectroscopy is the critical confirmatory observation . while cluster evolution is usually stated in terms of the abundances of properly identified clusters ,",
    "velocity dispersion is a dynamical measure of mass in its own right and can be compared directly with numerical simulations .",
    "a velocity dispersion @xmath4 on a proper scale @xmath5 at redshift @xmath6 would , in and of itself , constrain cosmological models to low @xmath7 ( eke , cole , & frenk 1996 ) , as would a definitive association of the cmbd with this redshift ( bartlett , blanchard , & barbosa 1998 ) .",
    "if confirmed , the 1312 + 4237 cluster would therefore be a `` smoking - gun '' measure of @xmath7 .",
