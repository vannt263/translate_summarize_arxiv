    "since the discovery of the first gravitational lens q0957 + 561 ( walsh , carswell & weymann 1979 ) , there has been considerable interest in monitoring the radio and optical emission of its lens images ( a quasar at @xmath15 ) , in order to find correlations between their light curves .",
    "strong correlations can give a time delay between the images and definitively prove that they are lensed images of one background object . already in 1964",
    "it was shown that such a time delay can be used to constrain the hubble parameter ( h@xmath9 ) , if a good lens mass model can be found ( refsdal 1964 ) .    for q0957 + 561",
    "several long - term monitoring programs finally resulted in a robust determination of the time delay ( e.g. kundi et al .",
    "combined with the lens mass model a value of h@xmath16 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 ( 95% confidence ) was determined ( kundi et al .",

    "1998 ) , and a new determination the velocity dispersion of the cluster lens by tonry & franx ( 1999 ) increased the value of h@xmath9 to 70@xmath17 or 72@xmath147 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 ( 1@xmath7 ) , using the spls or fgs models from grogin & narayan ( 1996a , 1996b ) , respectively .",

    "the errors on the flux density ratios are about 0.002 , determined from the same monte - carlo simulations .",
    "systematic differences between the light curves , however , appear appreciably larger than the error on the individual light - curve points , because the reduced @xmath31 between the light curves is always significantly larger than unity ( paper i ) . because the flux density ratios are most sensitive to small changes in the lens potential ( e.g. milli - lensing , micro - lensing in the case of a very compact source ( @xmath321 mas ) , the presence of small nearby companions to the lens galaxies , etc . ) , small - scale scintillation or systematic self - calibration errors , we will conservatively assume an error of 0.02 on the flux density ratios , which is approximately the scatter between the individual points of each light curve .",

    "the latter is of great importance if we search for the minimum@xmath31 solution in a space of many free parameters ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we investigate several different isothermal and non - isothermal mass models in an attempt to reproduce the observed properties of b1608 + 656 ( table 1 ) .",
    "the two lens galaxies ( g1 and g2 ) are fixed at their observed positions ( table 2 ) .",
    "the hst exposures were done using different filters ( f555w , f814w and f160w ) , each giving slightly different galaxy positions .",
    "models with the lens galaxies fixed at the positions determined from each filter are therefore considered .",
    "it should also be noted that the resulting model flux density ratio of image d ( @xmath50 ) is the only parameter never close to the observed value , throughout all mass models .",
    "the magnification depends critically on a combination of second order derivatives of the lens potential and small perturbations can therefore significantly change flux ratios .",
    "the delays and positions directly depend on zero - th and first order derivatives of the lens potential , respectively .",
    "hence , they are less sensitive to perturbations by small masses ( e.g. mao & schneider , 1998 ) .",
    "both the delay and position of image d are in excellent agreement with observations .    for each filter",
    "we construct four mass models : ( i ) sie+sie , using all constraints , ( ii ) sie+sie , without @xmath50 as a constraint , ( iii ) sie+nie , using all constraints and ( iv ) sie+nie , without @xmath50 as a constraint .",
    "mass models v and vi , presented in section 5.4 , are non - isothermal .",
    "the first attempt is to model both g1 and g2 with a sie mass distribution . in total",
    "there are 14 constraints ( 8 from the image positions , 3 from the flux density ratios and 3 from the time delays ) and 9 free parameters ( source position , hubble parameter , velocity dispersions , surface density axis ratios and position angles of g1 and g2 ) .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom ( ndf ) is five .",
    "this should give a well constrained set of free parameters , if they are non - degenerate .",
    "using all constraints , we minimize @xmath31 for the three sets of galaxy positions ( table 2 ) .",
    "the resulting model parameters , minimum-@xmath31 and hubble parameters are listed in table 3 ( model i ) . using different starting values for the model parameters and a slowly decreasing ` temperature ' in the simulated annealing algorithm ( see press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for a more detailed description of this minimization procedure ) , we ensure a very high probability of ending up at the global @xmath31minimum .",
    "the minimum@xmath31 value is significantly smaller when the hst wfpc2 f555w galaxy positions are used , in comparison with those from the wfpc2-f814w or nicmos - f160w observations .",
    "the @xmath31minimization is repeated , this time without the use of the flux density ratio of image d as a constraint .",
    "the resulting model and hubble parameters ( table 3 ; models ii ) are similar to models i , but @xmath31 has decreased more than expected on the basis of the decreased number of degrees of freedom ( ndf=4 ) .",
    "the flux density ratio of image d contributes disproportionally to @xmath31 compared with the other constraints , possibly due to a local perturbation of the lens potential ( e.g. milli- or micro - lensing ) .",
    "lens model f555w - ii has the smallest @xmath31 value of all sie+sie mass models in table 3 .",
    "figure 1 ( left ) shows both the critical - curve and caustic structure of this model and its time - delay surface . when moving a source from outside the caustic structure ",
    "e.g. where the source is singly imaged  the number of lens images changes by two , each time a caustic is crossed .",
    "we therefore expect the sie+sie models to show seven images , of which two are highly de - magnified , because they are located near the surface density singularities of g1 and g2",
    ".    however , the fifth image should be visible .",
    "it is formed on the saddle point of the time - delay surface near galaxy g2 ( fig .",
    "its magnification is around 0.2 .",
    "this should make it visible ( @xmath3050@xmath7 detection ) in the deep vla a - array observations available to us ( paper i ) .",
    "the image , however , is not detected , which poses a strong restriction on the allowed set of models .      the primary reason to introduce a small core radius for g2 is to remove the fifth image formed at the saddle - point of the time - delay surface between g1 and g2 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . if the core radius is large enough , there are no extrema on the time - delay surface and thus no images will form between g1 and g2 ( e.g. schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "we minimize @xmath31 again for the three sets of galaxy positions .",
    "the core radius of g2 is left free ( ndf=4 ; models iii ) .",
    "we repeat this without @xmath50 as a constraint ( ndf=3 ; models iv ) .",
    "the resulting model parameters and hubble parameters are listed in table 3 .",
    "lens model f555w - iv is shown in fig.1 ( right ) .",
    "the recovered image positions , flux density ratios and time delays from model f555w - iv are listed in table 5 .",
    "a significant improvement in the reduced @xmath31 is obtained with models iv over models ii ( no core radius for g2 ) and models i and iii ( with @xmath50 as constraint ) .",
    "there is also a decrease in the reduced @xmath31 from models f160w - iv to f555w - iv .",
    "this suggests that the mass centers of g1 and g2 are more closely associated with the emission centroids from the hst f555w exposure .",
    "the source now only crosses two caustics , when moving it from outside the caustic structure to its model position shown in fig.1 ( right ) .",
    "thus five images instead of seven are formed .",
    "this solves the ` central - image ' problem , even though no lower limit on the core radius of g2 was imposed .",
    "one of the five images forms near the surface density singularity of g1 and is highly de - magnified , because the magnification is almost inversely proportional to the surface density close to the singularity ( kormann , schneider & bartelmann 1994 ) .",
    "only four observable lens images remain , as is required by the observational constraints .",
    "comparing the mass model position angles of g1 and g2 ( table 3 ) , with the observed surface brightness position angles ( table 2 ) , we see a systematic @xmath2620 degree difference .",
    "we attempted several models with position angles for g1 and g2 in the range indicated in table 2 .",
    "the lens galaxy positions were not constrained and they were allowed to have a finite core radius . even though the system is close to being under - constrained , no satisfactory solutions with position angles close to those listed in table 2 could be obtained ( i.e. @xmath51 ) .",
    "the @xmath2620 degree difference in position angle between surface brightness and surface density of g1 and g2 therefore remains .",
    "there are several possible solutions : ( i ) the lens galaxies ( g1 and g2 ) have tri - axial halos , producing a misalignment between surface brightness and the projected surface density of the dark matter halo ( keeton , kochanek , & seljak 1997 ) .",
    "( ii ) a dynamical interaction between g1 and g2 could introduce a physical misalignment between the halo and the luminous matter .",
    "a ` merger ' scenario could explain why g1 and g2 look like post - starburst galaxies ( myers et al .",
    "1995 ) and have much bluer colors than expected for ellipticals ( keeton , kochanek , & falco 1998 ; fassnacht et al .  1999b , in preparation ) .",
    "star - formation associated with the deepest part of the lens potential would also explain why the galaxy positions from the hst f555w exposure seem most closely associated with the lens mass centers , although extinction by dust could make this argument more complicated .",
    "( iii ) external mass components can create the presence of an external shear near g1 and g2 , which introduces an apparent misalignment of surface brightness and density position angles ( keeton , et al .",
    "b1608 + 656 is part of a small group of galaxies ( fassnacht et al .  1999b , in preparation ) .",
    "however , based on their luminosities , these galaxies do not seem massive enough to cause significant perturbations of the lens potential .",
    "moreover , we have added an external shear to our best isothermal mass model ( f555w - iv ; table 3 ) and find no decrease in @xmath31 , even though ndf decreases by two .",
    "( iv ) the group of galaxies ( including g1 and g2 ) is associated with inter - galactic gas .",
    "this is often seen in hickson compact groups ( hickson 1982 ) through x - ray emission ( e.g. pildis , bregman & evrard 1995 ) .",
    "although the group of galaxies associated with b1608 + 656 is not very compact or massive , some gas could still be associated with it .",
    "if this gas ` halo ' is misaligned with g1 and g2 , the inferred surface density position angles can deviate from the surface brightness position angles , if the gas is not accounted for in the mass model .    in the cases ( iii ) and",
    "( iv ) , it remains peculiar that all image positions , time delays and two out of the three flux density ratios are reconstructed relatively well by the best mass model ( f555w - iv ) .",
    "this is hard to understand if a large - scale mass component or external shear is missing from the mass model .",
    "we therefore prefer either a tri - axial halo for g1 and g2 or a misalignment of the halo and the luminous matter due to dynamical interactions of g1 and g2 .",
    "both can explain the misalignment in position angle without invoking new mass components .",
    "to investigate the validity of using an isothermal mass distribution , we also tested models with surface density profiles given by @xmath52^{-\\gamma}}.\\ ] ] the normalization of @xmath53 is chosen to agree with that of eqn .",
    "( 1 ) for @xmath54 ( the isothermal model ) .",
    "the mass inside some arbitrary radius diverges for profiles with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we therefore place a lower limit of @xmath57 arcsec on the core radii of both g1 and g2 .",
    "both galaxies are placed on the observed f555w galaxy positions , which seem to best represent their mass centers ( section 5.1 ) .",
    "we use the code developed by barkana ( 1998 ) to calculate the deflection angle and magnification for models with @xmath58 .      using all observational constraints",
    ", we minimize @xmath31 as described in sections 5.13 ( model f555w - vi ) .",
    "the mass distributions of g1 and g2 are given the same value of @xmath59 .",
    "we repeat this without flux ratio @xmath50 as a constraint ( model f555w - v ) .",
    "the model parameters , hubble parameters and minimum-@xmath31 values are listed in table 4 .",
    "the table shows that @xmath31 minimizes in the range @xmath59 @xmath26",
    "0.40.6 , taking both models f555w - v and f555w - vi into account . the use of @xmath50 as constraint ( model f555w - vi ) increases the @xmath31 values by a factor of about 10 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath50 is correct and one of the other three images has an incorrect flux density ratio , we still find a comparable increase in @xmath31 .",
    "so for all models in this range of mass profiles , @xmath60 is the only observable that can not be reasonably matched to its model value . the inclusion of @xmath50 as a constraint changes @xmath59 of the best model from about 0.4 to 0.6 .",
    "the lowest values of @xmath50 that we find is 0.24 for model f555w - vi with @xmath61 .",
    "thus , keeping in mind that @xmath50 could be larger than 0.17  preferred by all models ( independent of @xmath59 )  the value of @xmath61 can be overestimated .",
    "when @xmath59<@xmath62 , the position angle of g1 rapidly decreases until a prolate halo is preferred with @xmath63 degrees for @xmath64 .",
    "values of @xmath59 much smaller than 0.5 are therefore on the basis of comparison with the surface brightness positions angle not very likely .",
    "moreover , for @xmath65 all minimum@xmath31 models form a fifth central image , similar to the sie+sie models ( section 5.1 ) .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath66 .",
    "the range of @xmath59@xmath260.40.6 for g1 and g2 agrees with constraints on @xmath59 from the gravitational lenses q0957 + 561 ( grogin & narayan 1996a ; barkana et al .",
