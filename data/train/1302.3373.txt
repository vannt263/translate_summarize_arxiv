    "quantum backflow is a fascinating quantum interference effect consisting in a negative current density for quantum wave packets without negative momentum components @xcite .",
    "it reflects a fundamental point about quantum measurements of velocity : usual measurements of momentum ( velocity ) distributions are performed globally - with no resolution in position - whereas the detection of the velocity field ( or of the flux ) implies a local measurement , that may provide values outside the domain of the global velocities , due to non commutativity of momentum and position @xcite . despite its intriguing nature - obviously counterintuitive from a classical viewpoint - quantum backflow",
    "has not yet received as much attention as other quantum effects .",
    "firstly discovered by allcock in 1969 @xcite , it only started to be studied in the mid 90 s .",
    "bracken and melloy @xcite provided a bound for the maximal fraction of probability that can undergo backflow .",
    "then , additional bounds and analytic examples , and its implications in the definition of arrival times of quantum particles where discussed by muga _ et al . _ @xcite .",
    "recently , berry @xcite analyzed the statistics of backflow for random wavefunctions , and yearsley _",
    "@xcite studied some specific cases , clarifying the maximal backflow limit .",
    "however , so far no experiments have been performed , and a clear program to carry out one is also missing .",
    "two important challenges are the measurement of the current density ( the existing proposals for local and direct measurements are rather idealized schemes @xcite ) , and the preparation of states with a detectable amount of backflow .    in this paper we derive a general relation that connects the current and the particle density , allowing for the detection of backflow by a density measurement , and propose a scheme for its observation with bose - einstein condensates in harmonic traps , that could be easily implemented with current experimental technologies .",
    "in particular , we show that preparing a condensate with positive - momentum components , and then further transferring a positive momentum kick to part of the atoms , causes under certain conditions , remarkably , a current flow in the negative direction .",
    "bose - einstein condensates are particularly promising for this aim because , besides their high level of control and manipulation , they are quantum matter waves where the probability density and flux are in fact a density and flux of particles in contrast to a statistical ensemble of single particles sent one by one , and in principle allow for the measurements of local properties in a single shot experiment .    ; at @xmath0 we apply a magnetic gradient that shifts the trap by a distance @xmath1 ; b ) the condensate starts to perform dipole oscillations in the trap ; c ) when it reaches a desired momentum @xmath2 the trap is switched off , and d ) then the condensate is let expand for a time @xmath3 ; e ) finally , a bragg pulse is applied in order to transfer part of the atoms to a state of momentum @xmath4 . ]",
    "let us start by considering a one dimensional bose - einstein condensate with a narrow momentum distribution centered around @xmath5 , with negligible negative components . then",
    ", we apply a bragg pulse that transfers a momentum @xmath6 to part of the atoms @xcite , populating a state of momentum @xmath7 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : scheme ] ) . by indicating with @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 the amplitudes of the two momentum states , the total wave function is @xmath10\\right ) , \\label{eq : bragg}\\ ] ] where we can assume @xmath11 without loss of generality ( with @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 being an arbitrary phase .",
    "all these parameters ( except the phase , that will be irrelevant in our scheme ) , can be controlled and measured in the experiment .",
    "then , by writing the wave function of the initial wave packet as @xmath14\\ ] ] with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being real valued functions , the expression for the total current density , @xmath17 $ ] can be easily put in the form @xmath18 , \\label{eq : current}\\ ] ] with @xmath19 being the total density .",
    "therefore , a negative flux , @xmath20 , corresponds to the following inequality for the density @xmath21\\rho_{\\psi}(x , t ) < \\frac{1}{|\\eta(x , t)| } |\\phi(x , t)|^{2 } ( a_{1}^{2 } -a_{2}^{2}),\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath22 . later on",
    "we will show that @xmath23 corresponds to a _ classical regime _",
    ", whereas for @xmath24 the backflow is a purely quantum effect , without any classical counterpart .",
    "therefore , in the _ quantum regime _ , backflow takes place when the density is below the following critical threshold : @xmath25 this is a fundamental relation that allows to detect backflow by a density measurement .",
    "it applies to any class of wavepackets of the form ( [ eq : bragg ] ) , including the superposition of two plane waves discussed in @xcite .",
    "we remark that , while in the ideal case of plane waves backflow repeats periodically at specific time intervals , for the present case it is limited to the transient when the two wave packets with momenta @xmath2 and @xmath4 are superimposed .",
    "in order to propose a specific experimental implementation , we consider a condensate in a three dimensional harmonic trap , with axial frequency @xmath26 . we assume a tight radial confinement , @xmath27 , so that the wave function can be factorized in a radial and axial components ( in the non interacting case this factorization is exact)@xcite . in the following",
    "we will focus on the 1d axial dynamics , taking place in the waveguide provided by the transverse confinement , that is assumed to be always on .",
    "we define @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the scheme proceeds as highlighted in fig.[fig : scheme ] . the condensate is initially prepared in the ground state @xmath30 of the harmonic trap .",
    "then , at @xmath0 the trap is suddenly shifted spatially by @xmath1 ( fig.[fig : scheme]a ) and the condensate starts to perform dipole oscillations ( fig.[fig : scheme]b ) .",
    "next , at @xmath31 , when the condensate has reached a desired momentum @xmath32 , the trap is switched off ( fig.[fig : scheme]c ) . at this point",
    "we let the condensate expand freely for a time @xmath3 ( fig.[fig : scheme]d ) .",
    "hereinafter we will consider explicitly two cases , namely a noninteracting condensate and the thomas - fermi ( tf ) limit @xcite , that can both be treated analytically .",
    "in fact , in both cases the expansion can be expressed by a scaling transformation @xmath33 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 represents the scaling parameter and @xmath35 is an irrelevant global phase ( for convenience we have redefined time and spatial coordinates , so that at @xmath0 - when the trap is switched off - the condensate is centered at the origin ) .",
    "this expression can be easily obtained by generalizing the scaling in @xcite to the case of an initial velocity field .    in the _ non interacting case _ , the initial wave function is a minimum uncertainty gaussian , @xmath36 $ ] , and the scaling parameter evolves as @xmath37 @xcite . for a tf distribution we have @xmath38^{1/2}$ ] for @xmath39 and vanishing elsewhere , with @xmath40 @xcite , and the chemical potential @xmath41 fixed by the normalization condition @xmath42 , the latter being the number of atoms in the condensate @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath34 satisfies @xmath43 , whose asymptotic solution , for @xmath44 , is @xmath45 @xcite .    finally , we apply a bragg pulse as discussed previously ( fig.[fig : scheme]e )",
    ". we may safely assume the duration of the pulse to be very short with respect to the other timescales of the problem @xcite .",
    "then , the resulting wave function is that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bragg ] ) , with the corresponding critical density for backflow in eq .",
    "( [ eq : denscrit ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath46 while the expression for the phase gradient is @xmath47 that , in the asymptotic limit @xmath44 , yields the same result @xmath48 for both the non interacting and tf wave packets .",
    "eventually , backflow can be probed by taking a snapshot of the interference pattern just after the bragg pulse , measuring precisely its minimum , and comparing it to the critical density .      before proceeding to the quantum backflow ,",
    "let us discuss the occurrence of a classical backflow . to this end",
    "it is sufficient to consider the flux of a single wave packet ( before the bragg pulse ) , namely @xmath49 . in this case",
    "the flux is negative for @xmath50 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : grad - theta ] ) ) .",
    "then , by indicating with @xmath51 the initial half width of the wave packet and with @xmath52 its left border at time @xmath3 , a negative flux occurs when @xmath53 , that is for @xmath54 . in the asymptotic limit",
    ", the latter relation reads @xmath55 ( @xmath56 for the non interacting and tf cases , respectively ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the momentum width of the wave packet is @xmath57 @xcite , so that the negative momentum components can be safely neglected only when @xmath58 .",
    "from these two conditions , we get that there is a negative flux ( even in the absence of initial negative momenta ) when @xmath59 .",
    "this can be easily satisfied in the tf regime .",
    "in fact , in that case the backflow has a classical counterpart due to the force @xmath60 implied by the repulsive interparticle interactions @xcite .",
    "these interactions are responsible for the appearance of negative momenta and backflow",
    ". then , sufficient conditions for avoiding these classical effects are @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "let us now turn to the quantum backflow . in order to discuss the optimal setup for having backflow , it is convenient to consider the following expression for the current density , @xmath63 ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : current ] ) and the expression for the total density .",
    "let us focus on its behavior around the center of wave packet , namely at @xmath64 ( the following analysis extends to the whole packet if @xmath65 is much larger than the condensate width ) . in the asymptotic limit , the phase gradient at the center is @xmath66 , and the flux in eq .",
    "( [ eq : current2 ] ) turns out to be proportional to that of the superposition of two plane waves of momenta @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this limit is particularly useful because for two plane waves the probability density is a sinusoidal function and the critical density becomes a constant , which in practice makes irrelevant the value of the arbitrary phase @xmath13 we can not control .",
    "then , the condition for having backflow at the wave packet center is @xmath69 since all the parameters @xmath70 and @xmath71 are positive , the minimal condition for having a negative flux is @xmath72 ( for @xmath73 ) , that can be written as @xmath74 where we have defined @xmath75 . the behavior of the function @xmath76 in the region where @xmath77 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : function ] .     defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fmin0 ] ) . for a given value of @xmath78",
    ", the maximal backflow is obtained for the value @xmath9 that minimizes @xmath79 . ]    in particular , for a given value of the relative momentum kick @xmath78 , the minimal value of @xmath79 is obtained for @xmath9 that solves @xmath80 , that is for @xmath81 in order to maximize the effect of backflow and its detection , one has to satisfy a number of constraints . in principle , fig .",
    "[ fig : function ] shows that the larger the value of @xmath75 , the larger the effect of backflow is .",
    "however , @xmath82 can not be arbitrarily large as it fixes the wavelength @xmath83 of the density modulations , which must be above the current experimental spatial resolution @xmath84 , @xmath85 , for allowing a clean experimental detection of backflow ( see later on ) .",
    "in addition , as discussed before , @xmath67 should be sufficiently large for considering negligible the negative momentum components of the initial wave packet , @xmath61 . therefore , since the maximal momentum that the condensate may acquire after a shift @xmath1 of the trap is @xmath86 , the latter condition reads @xmath87 . by combining the two conditions above",
    ", we get the hierarchy @xmath88 .",
    "furthermore , we recall that in the interacting case we must have @xmath89 in order to avoid classical effects . therefore , given the value of the current imaging resolution , the non interacting case ( @xmath90 ) appears more favorable than the tf one ( where typically @xmath91 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the latter condition can be substantially softened if the measurement is performed at the wave packet center , away from the left tail where classical effects take place .    .",
    "backflow corresponds to @xmath92 .",
    "positions are measured with respect to the wave packet center . ]",
    "as a specific example , here we consider the case of an almost noninteracting @xmath93li condensate @xcite prepared in the ground state of a trap with frequency @xmath94hz ( yielding @xmath95 m ) .",
    "then , we shift the trap by @xmath96 m , so that after a time @xmath97 ms the condensate has reached its maximal velocity @xmath98 mm / s . at this point",
    "the axial trap is switched off , and the condensate is let expand for a time @xmath99 until it enters the asymptotic plane wave regime ( here we use @xmath100  s ) .",
    "finally we apply a bragg pulse of momentum @xmath101 , with @xmath102 , that transfers @xmath103 of the population to the state of momentum @xmath4 , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : minf ] ) ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) @xcite .",
    "the resulting flux is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] , where the backflow is evident , and more pronounced at the wave packet center .",
    "the corresponding density is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens ] , where it is compared with the critical value of eq .",
    "( [ eq : denscrit ] ) .",
    "the values obtained around the center are @xmath106 and @xmath107 .    .",
    "positions are measured with respect to the wave packet center . ]",
    "let us now discuss more thoroughly the implication of a finite imaging resolution @xmath108 .",
    "first we note that experimentally it is difficult to obtain a precise measurement of the absolute density , because of uncertainties in the calibration of the imaging setup . instead , measurements in which the densities at two different points are compared are free from calibration errors and therefore are more precise . owing to this , it is useful to normalize the total density @xmath19 to its maximal value @xmath109 .",
    "in addition , we have to take into account that , due to the finite resolution @xmath84 @xcite , the sinusoidal term @xmath110 is reduced by a factor @xmath111 $ ] after the imaging .",
    "then , by indicating with @xmath112 the position of the density minima , we have @xmath113 where `` exp '' refers to the experimental conditions . instead , the normalized critical density is ( close the wave packet center , where @xmath114 ) @xmath115 so that , assuming that @xmath116 varies on a scale much larger than @xmath84 to be unaffected by the finite imaging resolution , the condition for _ observing _ a density drop below the critical value reads @xmath117 in particular , in the example case we have discussed , backflow could be clearly detected with an imaging resolution of about @xmath118 m , which is within reach of current experimental setups .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a feasible experimental scheme that could lead to the first observation of quantum backflow , namely the presence of a negative flux for states with negligible negative momentum components . by using current technologies for ultracold atoms ,",
    "we have discussed how to imprint backflow on a bose - einstein condensate and how to detect it by a usual density measurement . remarkably , the presence of backflow is signalled by the density dropping below a critical threshold .",
    "other possible detection schemes could for example make use of _ local _ velocity - selective internal state transitions in order to spatially separate atoms travelling in opposite directions .",
    "finally , we remark that a comprehensive understanding of backflow is not only important for its fundamental relation with the meaning of quantum velocity , but as also because of its implications on the use of arrival times as information carriers @xcite .",
    "it may as well lead to interesting applications such as the development of a matter wave version of an optical tractor beam @xcite , namely , particles sent from a source that could attract towards the source region other distant particles , in some times and locations .",
