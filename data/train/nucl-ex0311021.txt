    "the na57 experiment has been designed to study the production of strange baryons and antibaryons in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the experiment has extended the wa97  @xcite measurements to a wider centrality range and to a lower beam momentum .",
    "na57 results on hyperon yields  @xcite at 158 @xmath2  gev/@xmath3  confirm the enhancement pattern observed by the wa97 experiment , with an enhancement factor increasing with increasing strangeness . in this paper",
    "we shall concentrate on the analysis of the transverse mass ( @xmath4 ) spectra for the , ,  hyperons , their antihyperons and measured in pb - pb collisions at 158 @xmath2  gev/@xmath3 .",
    "the layout of the na57 experiment has been described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "a telescope of compactly packed silicon pixel detectors is used as main tracking device .",
    "additional pixel and double - sided silicon microstrip detectors are used to improve the momentum resolution for high momentum tracks . the telescope inclination angle with respect to the beam line and the distance from the target are set to accept particles produced in about half a unit of rapidity around central rapidity and medium transverse momentum .",
    "an array of scintillation counters provides a fast signal to trigger on the centrality of the collisions .",
    "a more precise centrality measurement is provided by two stations of silicon strip detectors .",
    "all detectors are located in the 1.4 t field of the goliath magnet .",
    "the triggered fraction of the total inelastic cross section is about 55% .",
    "the  mesons , the ,  and  hyperons and their antiparticles are identified by reconstructing their weak decays into final states containing only charged particles .",
    "decays are required to take place in a fiducial volume located between a fixed distance from the target and the first plane of the telescope .",
    "the selection procedure allows for extraction of hyperon and   signals with negligible background  @xcite .",
    "events have been divided into five centrality classes ( 0,1,2,3,4 ) , class 0 being the most peripheral and class 4 the most central , according to the charge particle multiplicity measured in the pseudorapidity intervals @xmath5  and @xmath6 .",
    "the centrality of the collision is expressed as number of wounded nucleons computed from the measured trigger cross sections using the glauber model .",
    "the centrality determination is described in detail in ref .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on the analysis of a data sample consisting of 460 m events of pb - pb collisions collected in the years 1998 and 2000 . for each particle species",
    "we define the fiducial acceptance window using a monte carlo simulation of the apparatus , in order to exclude the border regions .",
    "all data are corrected for geometrical acceptance and for detector and reconstruction inefficiencies on a particle - by - particle basis , using a monte carlo technique where simulated particles are embedded into real events ( the procedure has been described in detail in  @xcite ) .",
    "the correction method is cpu intensive ; therefore , while all the reconstructed @xmath0s and @xmath1s have been individually weighted , for the much more abundant ,  and   samples we only weighted a small fraction of the total sample in order to reach a statistical accuracy better than the limits imposed by the systematic error .",
    "the double - differential @xmath7  distributions for each particle have been parametrized using the expression    @xmath8    assuming the rapidity distribution to be flat ( @xmath9 ) within our acceptance region .",
    "the inverse slope parameter @xmath10  ( `` apparent temperature '' ) has been extracted by means of a maximum likelihood fit of eq .  [ eq : expo ] to the data .",
    "as discussed in detail in the next section , this apparent temperature can be interpreted as due to the thermal motion coupled with a collective transverse flow of the fireball components assumed to be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "transverse mass distributions @xmath11  for strange particles measured in the centrality range accessible to the experiment are shown in figure  [ fig : all_spectra ] .",
    "to to    the shapes of all spectra are well described by single exponential functions . in the next section , we shall attempt a global fit with the blast - wave model .",
    "the inverse slope parameters @xmath10  of the transverse mass spectra are given in table  [ tab : invslopes ] .",
    "they are in agreement within the errors with those measured over a smaller centrality range ( about 40% of the pb - pb inelastic cross section ) by the wa97 experiment  @xcite .",
    ".inverse slopes parameter @xmath10  ( mev ) of the strange particles in the full centrality range ( * 0 - 4 * ) .",
    "the first error is statistical , the second one systematic . [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in figure  [ fig : cont_msd ] we show the @xmath12  confidence level contours in the @xmath13@xmath14  parameter space as obtained from the blast - wave fit with the @xmath15   profile case .",
    "apart from the most peripheral interactions , the centrality dependence of the two parameters shows opposite trends , the temperature is decreasing and the average flow velocity is increasing with increasing centrality .    to",
    "we have analysed the transverse mass spectra of high statistics , high purity samples of , , @xmath0  and @xmath1particles produced in pb - pb collisions at 158 @xmath2  gev/@xmath3  over a wide range of collision centrality ( about the most central 55% of the pb - pb interaction cross section ) .",
    "for each hyperon species , the @xmath16  slope is found to be in good agreement with that of the corresponding anti - hyperon .",
    "the analysis in the framework of a blast - wave model using a linear velocity profile suggests that after a central collision the system expands explosively ; the system then freezes - out when the temperature is of the order of 120 mev with an average transverse flow velocity of about one half of the speed of light . particles with and without valence quarks in common with the nucleon appear to have similar behaviour . with increasing collision centrality , the transverse flow velocity increases and the final temperature decreases .",
