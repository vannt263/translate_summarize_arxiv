    "recent ultrasound measurements in @xmath0 ( y123 ) have provided conclusive evidence that this system undergoes a true phase transition at a temperature @xmath3 upon entering the pseudo - gap ( pg ) state @xcite .",
    "this study gives a thermodynamic signature of a pg phase as a new state of matter distinct from the superconducting ( sc ) state .",
    "the elastic response exhibits an anomaly associated with the electronic transition @xcite which takes place at the same temperature where an intra unit cell ( iuc ) magnetic order develops according to polarized neutron scattering experiments performed in y123 system @xcite . this magnetic order breaks time reversal symmetry but preserves lattice translation invariance . at variance with a simple ferromagnetic order ,",
    "the unit cell does not exhibit any net magnetization .",
    "such an order can be found as soon as staggered magnetic moments develop within the unit cell ( in that case , one usually speaks about a q=0 antiferromagnetic order ) .",
    "detailed macroscopic magnetic susceptibility measurements in y123@xcite indicate anomalies at the same temperature as the iuc magnetic order , confirming the magnetic nature of the transition .",
    "in addition at a slightly lower temperature , high resolution magneto - optic measurements@xcite show an anomalous kerr effect in the pg state in the same y123 system .",
    "first observed in y123 , the iuc magnetic order has been reported in three other cuprates families : @xmath4 ( hg1201 ) @xcite , @xmath5 ( la214 ) @xcite and @xmath2 ( bi2212 ) @xcite .",
    "however , the observation of such a magnetic order by polarized neutron technique has not been corroborated by magnetic local probe measurements : no indication of a magnetic transition has been observed so far using either nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) techniques @xcite or zero - field muon - spin rotation ( @xmath6sr ) technique @xcite . to reconcile , bulk polarized neutron scattering and local probe measurements",
    ", one can speculate @xcite that the iuc magnetic order develops within finite size domains and may fluctuate at a characteristic time - scale intermediate between the neutron time - scale ( 10@xmath7 sec ) and the local probes time - scales ( typically 10@xmath8 - 10@xmath9 sec ) explaining why these magnetic correlations can not be detected in @xmath6sr@xcite and nmr experiments @xcite as they remain dynamic at their time - scales .",
    "the iuc magnetism could be induced by counter - circulating loop currents within the unit cell of @xmath10 planes , as predicted by c. m. varma in his loop - current ( lc ) theory of the pg state @xcite . supporting this mean - field theory ,",
    "the study of the phase diagram of an effective three orbital model of cuprates using variational monte - carlo calculations has recently shown the stability of the lc state in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "but this theory faces a serious problem , since a q=0 electronic instability is not expected , in principle , to open a gap in the charge excitation spectrum .",
    "still within the lc model , a possible solution around this conundrum has been recently proposed @xcite as the ground state exhibits four degenerate discrete lc configurations . in the presence of disorder , fluctuating finite - size domains occur between these equivalent configurations . within a random field approximation ,",
    "the disorder gives rise to a `` central peak '' , directly observable in neutron diffraction as a bragg peak .",
    "however , these magnetic fluctuations would not be observable by local probes due to motional narrowing @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , a singular forward scattering of fermions for large correlation lengths induces a pseudo - gap in the single - particle spectral function near the chemical potential @xcite .",
    "alternative models have been recently developed to account for the neutron signal .",
    "first , still within the loop current approach , interesting proposals have been built where the currents flow around the full cuo@xmath11 octahedra @xcite but still having the same symmetry as the original lc model @xcite .",
    "counter - intuitively , this add - on actually does not improve significantly the description of the neutron intensity .",
    "interestingly , chiral order parameter based on the lc model has been also developed to explain the unusual polar kerr effect@xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , this proposal of chiral order does not also correspond to the experimental neutron data as it would produce extra bragg peaks along c * , the direction perpendicular to the cuo@xmath12 plaquette .",
    "for instance , in y123 , it would produce a doubling of the unit cell along c * meaning an extra bragg peak at l=1/2 which is clearly not observed in y123 @xcite . on a different perspective , ising - like orbital magnetic moments of oxygen atoms have been proposed to occur as a possible ground state of doped cuo@xmath12 plaquette @xcite .",
    "such intra - cuo@xmath12 plaquette staggered order exhibits the same symmetry as the spin moments at the oxygen sites@xcite and can as well account for the neutron intensity .",
    "recently , a new model for the pg state has been proposed based on a composite charge stripe order @xcite .",
    "this model proposes the pg physics is controlled by a stripe charge order parameter with two components : one is an incommensurate density variation , another is an incommensurate current .",
    "such an order breaks time reversal symmetry and generates loop currents .",
    "interestingly , the lc order can set up at a higher temperature than the charge density wave , when the density and the current components form a composite order with zero total momentum .",
    "this model suggests that it might exist different ways to account for the existence of iuc order in the phase diagram of cuprates .    to check the relevance of these scenarios",
    ", one needs to study the interplay between the opening of a pseudo - gap in the charge excitation spectrum , the observation of an iuc order and the disorder in cuprate materials . to this respect ,",
    "the bi2212 cuprate family is of particular interest . as the y123 system , bi2212 is a bilayer cuprate , but unlike y123 , its high surface quality allows a detailed study of the pg in the charge excitation spectrum on a size of a few micrometers using angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) @xcite and electronic raman spectroscopy @xcite ( ers ) or at the atomic scale using scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) spectroscopy @xcite . in bi2212 , two distinct techniques , polarized neutron scattering @xcite , on the one hand , and circularly polarized angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) @xcite , on the other hand ,",

    "the temperature dependencies of the magnetic neutron scattering intensity and dichroic effect in arpes display a striking similarity @xcite .",

    "furthermore , the existence of nanoscale electronic inhomogeneities can be imaged using stm spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "interestingly , specific signatures of orbital loop currents have been predicted@xcite in the spatially resolved local density of states of stm .    in y123 @xcite and hg1201 @xcite , the variation as a function of the hole doping of the magnetic ordering temperature @xmath13 matches the evolution of @xmath3 determined from resistivity measurements .",

    "the scaling relationship also breaks down when the system becomes inhomogeneous and the magnetic order occupies only a reduced fraction of the sample . in the case of the iuc magnetic order ,",
    "the limitation of @xmath159 and @xmath160 , the in - plane and out - of - plane magnetic correlation lengths , can account for the breakdown of the scaling relationship between bragg magnetic intensity and @xmath13 .    in y123 and bi2212",
    ", the observation of the magnetic bragg intensity highlights only the existence of 3d magnetic correlation lengths and , so far , there is no direct evidence of finite correlation lengths by diffraction .",
    "a limited reduction of the magnetic correlation length is actually difficult to observe directly .",

    "limited bragg scattering , one can at best estimate a lower bound of @xmath10975    for @xmath159 and @xmath160 . in contrast , a strong reduction of the magnetic correlation length can be observed directly .",
    "for instance , this has been demonstrated in lightly doped la214 @xcite , where the iuc magnetic order is 2d and @xmath1612 - 3 a.    in bi2212 , the fast decay of the magnetic scattering intensity from the ud-85 sample to the od-87 sample can then be understood by a weakening of the magnetic correlation length .",
    "the od-87 sample is close to critical hole doping at which the pg state is expected to vanish .",
    "as the pg state is a broken symmetry state ending at a quantum critical point , the od-87 sample lies within a quantum critical regime , largely controlled by fluctuations . keeping in mind that bi2212 is a rather disordered material",
    ", one can speculate that a certain quenched disorder could pin down and freeze the critical fluctuations at high temperature around the quantum critical point . within this scenario , the intrinsic disorder of a given cuprate family ,",
    "could allow the finite size pg domains to survive at rather high temperature around optimal doping .",
    "this argument applies particularly well for the orbital lc model having an ising - like discrete symmetry @xcite .",
    "the existence of a quenched disorder would block the quantum critical fluctuations associated with the lc order .",
    "another interesting related situation is given by zn substitution in underdoped y123 .",
