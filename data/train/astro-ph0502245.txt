    "relativistic objects including , but not limited to , gamma - ray burst ( grb ) sources are known to produce nonthermal emission , which typically requires the generation of extra magnetic field , at least at some stage of ejecta expansion after initial prompt energy release @xcite .",
    "a number of recent publications @xcite put forward the concept of magnetic field generation by a relativistic version of the weibel instability @xcite .",
    "analytical considerations @xcite , together with more sophisticated numerical modelling @xcite , suggest that the magnetic field produced by the weibel instability is random and extremely small - scale , with a characteristic correlation length @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the plasma skin depth , @xmath2 is the electron plasma frequency , and @xmath3 is the speed of light .",
    "depending on the magnetic field saturation value @xmath4 , this correlation length may be less than the coherence length ( or formation zone ) of synchrotron radiation : @xmath5 here , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the electron charge and mass , and @xmath8 is the electron gyrofrequency .",
    "generation of electromagnetic emission by relativistic electrons moving in small - scale magnetic fields is known to differ from the case of emission by electrons in a uniform ( large - scale ) magnetic field @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic radiation in small - scale _ random _ magnetic fields was first calculated by @xcite using perturbation theory , where the trajectory of the particle is assumed to be rectilinear , while the acceleration produced by the random variations of the lorentz force is taken into account by the first non - zero order of the perturbation theory .",
    "the full non - perturbative theory was later worked out by @xcite , allowing in particular net deflections of the radiating particles that are not necessarily small ( e.g. , by a large - scale magnetic field and/or multiple scattering on small - scale inhomogeneities ) .",
    "recently , interest in this emission process in the context of gamma - ray bursts was revived by @xcite , who estimated radiation spectrum in the presence of the small - scale magnetic field and referred to the resulting radiation as  jitter radiation \" .",
    "an oversimplification of the estimates performed by @xcite resulted in the low - frequency asymptotic limit of the jitter spectrum , @xmath9 , which is applicable to a simpler ( undulator - like ) version of what is considered here , while may noticeably deviate from the correct spectral shape in a general case . in this paper a general treatment of the radiation produced by relativistic electrons moving through small - scale fluctuating magnetic fields , probably available at the relativistic shocks ,",
    "is presented . for the completeness and convenience of further applications ,",
    "we first formulate a simplified perturbative version of the theory , and then specify its region of applicability by comparing with the available non - perturbative version .",
    "possible implications of the general theory for grb physics are discussed .",
    "let us calculate the radiation by a single relativistic particle moving in a random small - scale magnetic field based on the equation for the radiated energy resulting from perturbation theory @xcite    @xmath10     d\\left(\\frac{\\omega'}{\\omega}\\right).\\ ] ]    here @xmath11 in the vacuum , while @xmath12 in the presence of the background plasma , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the angle between the electron speed and the direction of the emission , @xmath15 is the fourier transform of the particle acceleration @xmath16 transverse to the particle speed , and @xmath17 is the corresponding transverse component of the lorentz force .",
    "evidently , for a random lorentz force the acceleration is a random function as well , although the average of @xmath18 includes a regular ( not random ) component , which eventually specifies the emission pattern .    to find the averaged value of @xmath19 ,",
    "assume that the random lorentz force ( @xmath20 , which can include either magnetic and/or electric fields ) perturbing the rectilinear particle motion , can be expressed as a fourier integral over @xmath21 and @xmath22 : @xmath23 this force represents a global field , which can vary in space and time in general .",
    "however , the particle acceleration is produced by a local value of this field related to instantaneous positions of the particle along its actual trajectory . within the perturbation theory",
    "we can adopt @xmath24 for the independent argument of the force acting on the moving particle : @xmath25 then the fourier component @xmath26 , specifying the magnitude @xmath27 , can be found by direct temporal fourier transform of ( [ e_appr ] ) : @xmath28 now it is straightforward to write down the square of the force modulus @xmath29 : @xmath30    this value is still fluctuating in the random field , although its mean value is non - zero ( in contrast to the fluctuating field itself @xmath31 , which is a complex random function with zero mean ) .",
    "a steady - state level of radiation is evidently specified by the average value @xmath32 of ( [ e_four_2 ] ) . the easiest way to perform",
    "the averaging is to average eq .",
    "( [ e_four_2 ] ) over all possible initial positions @xmath33 of the particle inside the source . in practice",
    ", this corresponds to a uniform distribution of radiating particles within a volume containing the field inhomogeneities , which have a statistically uniform distribution within the same volume .",
    "since the exponent @xmath34 oscillates strongly for @xmath35 , we obtain : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the source volume , and , for @xmath32 obtain accordingly @xmath38 then the mean value of the fourier transform of the particle acceleration is expressed as @xmath39 which provides a unique correspondence between the _ temporal and spatial _ fourier transform of the lorentz force ( right - hand side ) and the _ temporal _ fourier transform of the particle acceleration ( left - hand side ) . substituting ( [ w_perp_3 ] ) into ( [ cal_e_w_perp ] ) , using dummy variables ( @xmath40 ) for ( @xmath41 ) ,",
    "we obtain finally for the radiated energy per unit range of @xmath21 @xmath42      \\int   dq_0 d{\\bf q }    \\delta(\\omega'-q_0+{\\bf qv } ) \\mid   { \\bf f}_{q_0 , { \\bf q } } \\mid^2.\\ ] ]    the spectrum of the radiation described by eq .",
    "( [ cal_e_w_perp_3 ] ) depends on the statistical properties of the random force . to be more specific",
    "let us consider a random magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath43 , and introduce the second - order correlation tensor of the statistically uniform random magnetic field as follows @xcite : @xmath44 then , express @xmath45 via the fourier spectrum @xmath46 of this correlation tensor b_{st , \\alpha}({\\bf r}',t')b_{st,\\beta}({\\bf r}'',t '' ) =   \\int \\frac{d\\tau d{\\bf r}}{(2\\pi)^{8}}\\exp[i(q_0\\tau-{\\bf qr } ) ] \\int dt ' d{\\bf r } ' b_{st , \\alpha}({\\bf r}',t')b_{st,\\beta}({\\bf r}'+{\\bf r},t'+\\tau ) ) =   \\frac{tv}{(2\\pi)^4 } \\int \\frac{d\\tau d{\\bf r}}{(2\\pi)^{4}}\\exp[i(q_0\\tau-{\\bf qr})]k_{\\alpha \\beta}^{(2)}({\\bf r},\\tau)=",
    "\\frac{tv}{(2\\pi)^4 } k_{\\alpha \\beta}^{(2)}(q_0,{\\bf q})$ ] .",
    "here we used the correlation tensor defined by eq .",
    "( [ corr_2 ] ) , whose fourier transform is @xmath47 .",
    "then , multiplying this by @xmath48 , obtain ( [ b_corr ] ) . ] :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the spectrum of the random magnetic field transverse to the particle velocity .",
    "if the random field is composed of random waves with the dispersion relation @xmath51 ( in the limiting case of a static random field we have @xmath52 ) , the spectrum takes the form @xmath53 .    substituting all required values into ( [ w_perp_3 ] ) and dividing by the total duration of emission @xmath54 we arrive at the radiation intensity ( energy emitted per unit frequency per unit time ) : @xmath55      \\int   dq_0 d{\\bf q }    \\delta(\\omega'-q_0+{\\bf qv } ) k({\\bf q})\\delta(q_0-q_0({\\bf q})),\\ ] ] which eventually results in radiation spectra different from one estimated by @xcite",
    "it is now straightforward to consider a few different models of the random magnetic field .",
    "let us proceed with the case of quasi - static magnetic inhomogeneities , @xmath56 , which is applicable for magnetic inhomogeneities moving slower than the radiating particle . in the general case we assume : @xmath57 where the tensor structure of @xmath58 should be consistent with maxwell s equation @xmath59 and provide the correct normalization @xmath60 .",
    "consider the isotropic case @xmath61 with a specific power - law for the spectrum of random magnetic field : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the high - frequency spectral index of the magnetic turbulence .",
    "the integral over @xmath64 then takes the form : @xmath65.\\ ] ]    subsequent integration over @xmath66 yields the radiation spectrum over the entire spectral range .",
    "we consider the low - frequency and high - frequency asymptotic behavior of the spectrum . at high frequencies , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , @xmath69 can be discarded everywhere in eq .",
    "( [ int_q_2 ] ) , so after integration over @xmath66 we have @xmath70 and the radiation spectrum resembles the turbulence spectrum at @xmath71 . at low frequencies , @xmath72 , the term @xmath73 can be discarded in ( [ int_q_2 ] ) , which leads to the frequency - independent part of the spectrum @xmath74 . at even lower frequencies , @xmath75 ,",
    "when the difference between @xmath76 and @xmath77 is important , the term @xmath73 dominates again giving rise to the spectral asymptote @xmath78 .",
    "note that this property does not depend on the specific shape of the correlation function @xmath79 in the range of small @xmath80 ( @xmath81 in our case ) , and remains valid for any shape peaking at @xmath69 . to see this explicitly ,",
    "consider the following simplified form of the spectrum : @xmath82 at @xmath83 and @xmath84 at @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , in place of ( [ int_q_2 ] ) we have : @xmath86,\\ ] ] which does not depend on @xmath21 at @xmath87 ( or @xmath88 ) for @xmath89 , thus , for any fluctuation _ energy _ spectrum , @xmath90 , peaking at @xmath69 .",
    "in particular , this is also valid for the bremsstrahlung spectrum , which arises as the fast particle experiences random accelerations at microscopic scales by randomly distributed coulomb centers .",
    "we now demonstrate that the same is valid for the two - dimensional geometry implied by the current models of magnetic field generation at the relativistic shocks @xcite .",
    "consider a specific case , when the observer looks along the @xmath91 axis , the shock front lies in the @xmath92 plane , and the random field belongs to the shock front , first examined by @xcite , who obtained a result different from one given below .",
    "note , that now the most general form of @xmath93 is @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the unit vector normal to the shock front . since we observe along the @xmath91 axis , particles moving along this direction are the main contributors to the emission , so that @xmath96 in the argument of @xmath97-function",
    ". thus , we obtain : @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "the correlation function @xmath79 has a peak around @xmath100 . assuming the function @xmath101 keeps this property , which is typically the case , then at small frequencies ( @xmath87 ) integral ( [ int_q_1 ] )",
    "does not depend on frequency , and the substitution of it into ( [ i_perp_1 ] ) gives rise to a frequency - independent spectrum @xmath102 , which is flatter ( not steeper ) than the asymptotic spectrum of synchrotron radiation .",
    "thus , this flat low - frequency spectrum seems to be rather common in the presence of small - scale random magnetic or electric fields .",
    "however , in some specific models of the random field , the low - frequency spectrum can deviate from the flat spectrum .    as an example of this latter point , consider a ( somewhat artificial ) factorized correlation function @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 stand for components parallel and transverse to the particle velocity ( note that a special model of the field , which is uniform in the plane transverse to the particle velocity , when @xmath106 , is absorbed by this particular case ) .",
    "then , integrations over @xmath107 and @xmath108 can be performed independently , so that @xmath109 and the low - frequency asymptote of the radiation spectrum is ultimately specified by the behavior of @xmath110 at @xmath111 ( e.g. , @xmath112 for correlation function like ( [ power_law_spectr ] ) ) , and can easily be steeper than @xmath113 spectrum with the steepest possible asymptote @xmath114 ( ignoring non - perturbative effects and wave dispersion ) .    to see this ,",
    "consider an extreme case of a small - scale field , namely , one comprising a single spatial harmonic @xmath115 , which evidently provides the narrowest possible radiation spectrum . all integrations are extremely easy in this case , in particular , @xmath116 giving rise to the linear low - frequency asymptote @xmath117 , in agreement with the estimate of @xcite .",
    "a similar kind of regular ( but small - scale ) acceleration takes place in undulators or in the case of so - called small - pitch - angle radiation @xcite , resulting in a similar radiation spectrum .",
    "however , in the general case of a _ stochastic _ magnetic field , the radiation spectrum deviates strongly from this simpler case .",
    "it should be emphasized , that the applicability of the perturbation theory developed above is itself rather limited . indeed ,",
    "even if the deflection of the particle is small during the time needed to pass through a single correlation cell of the random field , it is not necessarily small along the coherence length of the emission , since multiple scattering of the particle by several successive magnetic inhomogeneities can easily provide large enough deflections due to angular diffusion to render perturbation theory inapplicable .",
    "thus , we explicitly have to consider the applicability of perturbation theory to the emission of fast particles moving in the small - scale random fields .",
    "the coherence length @xmath118 of emission by relativistic particle with the lorentz - factor @xmath76 at a frequency @xmath21 decreases as frequency increases , so the approximation of the rectilinear motion is eventually valid at sufficiently large frequencies .",
    "however , at lower frequencies the coherence length may be larger than the correlation length of the random field , and this necessarily will be the case at low enough frequencies if one neglects the effect of the wave dispersion in the plasma .",
    "thus , the particle trajectory traverses several correlation lengths of the random field to emit this low frequency , and its trajectory random walks due to uncorrelated scattering by successive magnetic inhomogeneities , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ randomwalk ] .",
    "this angular diffusion will clearly affect the radiation spectrum if the mean angle of the particle deflection @xmath119 _ accumulated _ along the coherence length @xmath120 exceeds the beaming angle of the emission @xmath121 .    to estimate the deflection angle @xmath119 ,",
    "adopt that the random field consists of cells with the characteristic scale @xmath122 and rms field value @xmath123 .",
    "inside each cell , the electron velocity rotates by the angle @xmath124 , where @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "since the deflections are produced by successive _ uncorrelated _ cells of the random field , the mean square of the deflection angle after traversing @xmath127 cells will be @xmath128 , where the number of the cells is specified by the ratio of the coherence length @xmath120 to the correlation length @xmath122 of the random field , @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , when the particle passes the length @xmath130 required to produce the emission at a frequency @xmath21 , its characteristic deflection angle is @xmath131 . this angular diffusion will strongly affect the emission if @xmath132 , i.e. , at @xmath133 which occurs in the range of the low - frequency asymptotic limit discussed above .    the non - perturbative version of the theory is not discussed in any detail here since it is published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the full radiation spectrum ( also including the effect of a regular magnetic field , if present ) is given by eq .",
    "( 35 ) of @xcite .",
    "[ spectra ] presents radiation spectra ( calculated with the use of the non - perturbative formulae ( 35 ) of @xcite , or , equivalently , eq .",
    "( 30 ) of @xcite ) for a single relativistic electron with a lorentz - factor @xmath134 moving in the presence of fluctuating small - scale fields ( with different ratios @xmath135 , the regular magnetic field is assumed to be very weak , the distribution of random field is isotropic ( like ( [ power_law_spectr ] ) ) , and @xmath136 . although the combination of parameters adopted to produce fig . [ spectra ] does not span all the regimes possibly relevant to the grb case ( see also the review paper @xcite ) , it shows the variety of asymptotes in one plot and displays spectra both affected and unaffected by the non - perturbative effects , which should be sufficient for illustration purpose .",
    "the solid curve corresponds to the parameters similar to those adopted by @xcite for the grb sources ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "although the flat region obtained already within the perturbation approach exists , it is easy to see a region of the radiation spectrum @xmath138 , provided by the multiple scattering , which occupies the frequency range @xmath139 note , that the left bound of this inequality is below the limit @xmath140 imposed by the effect of the wave dispersion in the perturbative treatment .",
    "stated another way , in the non - perturbative regime the wave dispersion comes into play at lower frequencies than expected based on the perturbative treatment .",
    "this region of the spectrum ( missing within the perturbation theory ) exists for any relativistic particle with @xmath141 i.e. , for @xmath142 for the adopted parameters @xmath137 , which turns out to be important for most ( if not all ) available relativistic electrons in the grb source .    on the contrary , for smaller - scale fields , dashed and dash - dotted curves ,",
    "the angular diffusion becomes less and less important , which justifies the applicability of the perturbation theory for corresponding conditions . at even lower frequencies the spectrum falls as @xmath143 due to the effect of wave dispersion in the plasma .",
    "the high - frequency end of the spectrum is described by the power - law @xmath144 , i.e. , mimics the shape of the assumed spatial correlation function .",
    "both these asymptotes are present in the perturbative version of the theory .",
    "typically , the grb spectrum can be well fitted with a two - component band model @xcite , which represents the observed spectrum as a sum of low - energy component , @xmath145 , and high - energy component , @xmath146 with @xmath147 .",
    "the distribution of the low energy spectral indices @xmath148 of grbs @xcite , which is a bell - shaped curve with the peak at @xmath149 with fwhm about 1 , and reaches values @xmath150 , is a challenge for available emission mechanisms @xcite .",
    "indeed , optically thin synchrotron emission can only produce low energy indices @xmath151 which are incompatible with about 25@xmath152 of the spectra .",
    "inverse compton emission ( as well as a few other more exotic processes ) seems to be more promising since it can produce any negative spectral index @xmath153 , which is compatible with roughly 98@xmath152 of the spectra . the optically thick synchrotron model @xcite might accommodate the rest 2@xmath152 of the positive @xmath148 .",
    "however , it is remarkable that none of these bounding values ( @xmath154 ) has any imprint on the distribution : it is equally smooth at @xmath155 or @xmath156 and does not even reach values @xmath157 .    by comparison , the grb low - energy - spectral - index distribution appears to be a natural outcome of diffusive synchrotron emission . leaving the detailed analysis and discussion of some specific issues @xcite to a future study",
    ", we note that the main low - frequency asymptote , @xmath158 , corresponds to the peak of the distribution , which suggests plausible interpretation why most of the low energy indices fall around the value @xmath159 .",
    "then , for lower frequencies , this asymptote gradually gives way to the asymptote @xmath160 , related to the multiple scattering effect , which is compatible with about 90@xmath152 of the spectra .",
    "therefore , the part of the diffusive synchrotron radiation spectrum including these two asymptotes is capable of explaining the whole range of the `` typical '' low energy spectral indices ( which we define as a confidence interval around the mean value ) .",
    "the remaining 10@xmath152 of the spectra might be treated as `` untypical '' , probably requiring some extreme combination of parameters or some special structure of the random field . in any case",
    ", they are compatible with the transition to the lowest - frequency asymptote , @xmath161 .",
    "it is especially interesting that the latter asymptote corresponds well to the presence of a secondary ( weak but significant ) peak in the distribution at about @xmath162 .",
    "in contrast , the high - frequency asymptote , @xmath163 , represents the softest possible high - frequency spectrum in the presence of small - scale random magnetic fields . for example , if @xmath164 , than the softest power spectral index is @xmath165 and the softest _",
    "spectral index is @xmath166 independently of the relativistic electron distribution over energy ( evidently , the spectrum can be harder than this for hard enough electron distributions ) .",
    "motion of a charged particle in the presence of random fields generally represents a kind of spatial and angular diffusion , therefore , we refer to the emission by this particle as diffusive synchrotron radiation .",
    "this paper presents a special case of the theory of diffusive synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electron deflections on a small - scale random magnetic field in the absence of the regular magnetic field .",
    "this theory includes both the simplified perturbation approach and the non - perturbative treatment , which turns out to be of primary importance in the radiation spectrum formation .",
    "the obtained spectrum of diffusive synchrotron radiation substantially expands thejitter \" radiation spectrum suggested by @xcite based on semi - quantitative evaluations .",
    "the derived spectrum is composed of several power - law asymptotic regimes smoothly giving way to each other as the emission frequency changes , which is apparently consistent with the observed distribution of the low energy spectral indices in grbs .",
    "@xmath167 diffusive synchrotron radiation has a very general nature and will be observed from any source capable of producing small - scale random magnetic / electric fields at a sufficient level , like active galactic nuclei , extragalactic jets , hot spots in the radio galaxies , galactic sources with a strong energy release , as well as solar flares ,    @xmath167 a low - frequency spectrum , @xmath168 , valid in the presence of _ ordered _ small - scale magnetic field fluctuations , does not occur in the general case of small - scale _ random _ magnetic field fluctuations ,    @xmath167 diffusive synchrotron radiation arising from the scattering of fast electrons on small - scale _ random _ magnetic or / and electric fields produces a broad variety of low - frequency spectral asymptotes  from @xmath169 to @xmath161  sufficient to interpret the entire range of low energy spectral indices observed from grb sources , while the high - frequency spectrum @xmath144 may affect the corresponding high energy spectral index distribution .",
