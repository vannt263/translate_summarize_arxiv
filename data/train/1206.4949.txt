    "our knowledge is ultimately restricted by the boundaries of what we have explored by direct observation or experiment .",
    "experiments conducted within previously inaccessible regimes have often revealed new aspects of the universe , facilitating new insights into its fundamental operation .",
    "examples of this pervade the history of physical science .",
    "recently , the theories of general relativity and quantum field theory have arisen to describe aspects of the universe that can only be accessed experimentally within the regimes of the very large and the very small , respectively .",
    "the spectacular array of useful technologies brought about owing to the formulation of these theories over the previous century are vociferous testament to the utility of expanding our experimental horizons .",
    "the success of these two theories also confronts us with a formidable challenge . on one hand",
    ", quantum theory excellently describes the behaviour of physical systems at small length scales . on the other hand , general relativity theory excellently describes systems involving very large scales : long distances , high accelerations , and massive bodies .",
    "each of these theories has successfully weathered copious experimental tests independently , yet the two theories are famously incompatible in their fundamental assertions .",
    "one expects that both theories are limiting cases of one set of overarching laws of physics .",
    "however , the tremendous experimental success of quantum theory and general relativity , i.e. , their enormous individual ranges of validity , makes it extremely difficult to find experimental evidence that points us towards such unifying laws of physics  a fully quantum theory of gravity .",
    "theoretical research has yielded intriguing indications about this sought - after unifying theory of quantum gravity .",
    "for example , studies of quantum effects in the presence of black holes , such as hawking radiation and evaporation , indicate that it will be crucial to understand how the flow and transformations of information are impacted by relativistic and quantum effects , with the notion of entanglement playing a central role .",
    "ultimately , however , the field of quantum gravity will require more experimental guidance .",
    "so far , the best potential for solid experimental evidence for full - blown quantum gravitational effects stems from observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "however , while of the highest interest , the observation of quantum gravity effects in the cmb would still constitute only a passive one - shot experimental observational opportunity  we can not repeat the big bang .    in this paper",
    "we thus envisage possible avenues for active experimental probes of quantum phenomena at large length scales , towards those at which gravitational effects will play an increasingly significant role .",
    "the aim in the short term is to probe more - or - less solid theoretical expectations , while in the longer term to explore physical regimes in which the predictions of theory are not as clear .",
    "to begin making inroads , it seems necessary to test the behaviour of quantum systems , particularly those with entanglement , while these systems possess high speeds and are separated by large distances . on earth , tests of quantum entanglement have been performed at distances up to 144 km  @xcite . while this is a significant achievement , it falls short of the large scale relevant for relativistic considerations .",
    "additionally , these tests were performed with stationary detectors .",
    "while it is difficult to perform tests with moving detectors , it is conceivable to measure entanglement with beamsplitters moving at up to 1000 m/s ( @xmath1 )  @xcite .",
    "however , this also falls short  one would need to perform entanglement tests in which the detectors are in relative motion at speeds nearer lightspeed ( @xmath2 ) where relativistic effects become significant .",
    "it is interesting to note that active laboratory measurements of gravity at small scales using atomic interferometers have also been proposed  @xcite .",
    "quantum repeater networks are a promising candidate for the long distance dissemination of quantum entanglement  @xcite .",
    "however , the study of quantum repeaters shows that even with optimistic estimates , reaching 1000 km will be a huge challenge .",
    "even if quantum transmission technology is developed that is capable of transmitting entangled systems around the earth , the maximum separation between detectors that can be achieved is bounded by the earth s diameter : around 13,000 km .    to achieve tests at greater distances and speeds , one needs to move off of planet earth , and into space .",
    "it is conceivable that in the not - too - distant future one could perform quantum entanglement tests at the scale of inter - planetary distances , with the associated velocities . for the nearer term ,",
    "the next step is to perform quantum experiments that utilize earth - orbiting satellite platforms .",
    "a satellite in low earth orbit ( leo ) , for example , will allow distances greater than @xmath3 m and relative speeds of two detectors of @xmath4 .",
    "satellite missions for quantum communications have been considered in various configurations  @xcite , and some scientific tests utilizing such satellites have been proposed .",
    "the canadian space agency ( csa ) and the institute for quantum computing ( iqc ) have been participating in ongoing studies , dubbed qeyssat  @xcite , emphasizing the wider and long term context of such missions for science as well as quantum applications such as global - scale quantum key distribution ( qkd ) .",
    "these and other proposals for satellite - based quantum apparatuses open a door to distances and velocities that are either prohibitively impractical or simply impossible to achieve on the ground . here",
    "we describe a number of ideas stemming from a series of discussions that took place at the perimeter institute for theoretical physics , which focused on what tests of fundamental quantum physics could be achieved with such experimental setups .",
    "we consider a variety of scenarios , illustrated in figure  [ overviewscales ] , of which some will be accessible with today s technologies , such as a single satellite at leo altitudes ( 5001000 km ) .",
    "experiments at larger distances will be possible only on a longer time frame , owing to their complexity and the advanced technologies that are required , and include systems in geostationary ( geo ) orbits ( 36,000 km ) or even earth - moon distances ( 380,000 km ) .",
    "visionary experiments involving distances at the scale of the earth s distance to the sun ( 150gm ) are conceivable , but require technologies yet to be developed .    here",
    "we consider experimental scenarios that are visionary in nature , focusing on the scientific novelty of such experiments and their capacity to offer significant new insights , and intentionally avoiding dwelling on technological or financial limitations .",
    "it follows that these scenarios may be achievable within varying timeframes .",
    "the space science community may at some point consider these proposals within the context of future missions .",
    "furthermore , we attempt to avoid bias with regard to expectations of experimental outcomes by also considering several ideas which are based on unconventional physical theories .    for each proposed experiment",
    "we explain the basic idea and physical concepts that it probes , including references for further details .",
    "we also attempt to provide some characterization of the magnitude of the expected effect .",
    "we wish to note that this paper resembles a review article , as it covers a wide spectrum of physical effects , contributed by multiple authors from a number of perspectives . in order to give a better indication of the primary contributor for each section",
    ", we indicate the primary authors at the end of the paper .",
    "we hope to encourage physicists to take one or more of these experiment concepts and work towards establishing the details of how it may work in practice , and more carefully examine the magnitude of observable effects that may be observed .",
    "similar questions have already been posed for the space - quest project , which aims to place an entangled photon source on the international space station  @xcite .",
    "our analysis goes beyond that work and studies various possible science experiments on a broader scope .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec.classification ]",
    "we define a broad classification scheme for the proposed experiments . in section  [ sec.summary ]",
    "we present a table summarizing the list of experiments , including some indication of the practical feasibility of each .",
    "the experiments themselves are organized into broad categories based upon the nature of the physical theories which the experiment is designed to probe . in section  [ sec.entanglement ]",

    "finally , in section  [ sec.technology ] we provide some technical details on the current state of the art for quantum optics experiments in space , and make some concluding remarks in section  [ sec.conclusion ] .      in order to give the reader some initial indicator of the nature of a proposed experiment",
    ", we introduce a broad classification scheme that roughly characterizes the feasibility and ambitiousness of each test .",
    "the classes are defined as follows :    * level-1 experiments verify well - established physics in a new regime , often at larger length scales than have yet been probed experimentally .",
    "* level-2 experiments test physics that is somewhat less certain .",
    "an example is an experiment whose predicted outcome involves the parallel transport of spins in curved spacetime .",
    "it seems pretty clear along which spacetime path the spins should be transported , however physical phenomena whose outcomes involve such computations have not yet been tested experimentally .",
    "* level-3 experiments consider situations in which the scale of a test is expanded into regimes in which various proposed alternative theories predict an outcome other than that predicted by conventional physics .",
    "the intent of such an experiment is to seek evidence for or against such an alternative theory .",
    "* level-4 experiments test physics in regimes for which there is not yet a standard theory which can be used to predict the outcome .",
    "instead we propose tests based on models which find their motivation from the expected ( or guessed ) nature of physics in these regimes .",
    "tests of quantum gravity fall into this latter category .",
    "we consider the experiments summarized in table  [ tab.summary ] .",

    "the space environment opens the possibility of performing entanglement experiments over extremely long distances , allowing us to push the verification bounds of quantum theory .",
    "the possibility of , thereby , observing deviations from predictions of the theory is tantalizing",
    ".      quantum theory tells us that , within a multipartite entangled system , the measurement - induced collapse of the state caused by measuring one particle will be ` instantaneously ' reflected in measurement outcomes on the other particles , regardless of how far apart those particles may be .",
    "the troubling nature of this , first realized by einstein , podolsky , and rosen  @xcite ( epr ) , was later cast into the form of bipartite spin measurements by bohm  @xcite ( eprb ) , characterized rigorously by bell  @xcite , and later again cast into an experimentally - testable manner by clauser , horne , shimony , and holt ( chsh )  @xcite .",
    "bell and chsh each produced an inequality relating the statistical correlations of the outcomes of measurements performed on the two particles under two naturally intuitive assumptions : ( 1 )  that physical systems possess only objective locally - defined properties ( independent of measurement context ) , and ( 2 )  that influences between systems can not propagate faster than light - speed . under certain configurations , quantum mechanics",
    "violates these `` bell inequalities '' .",
    "experimental tests of bell inequalities involve gathering correlation statistics by measuring numerous entangled photon pairs .",
    "thus far , these bell tests have been consistent with quantum theory , and therefore , despite their intuitiveness , the assumptions of bell s derivation do not hold .",
    "the first experiment we consider involves testing the phenomenon of quantum entanglement over large distances .",
    "quantum mechanics does not predict any breakdown in its description of largely extended quantum states .",
    "how valid is this assumption ?",
    "current experiments on the ground have reached 144 km , and distances beyond that are difficult to impossible to be explored on the ground .",
    "( there is also the possibility that quantum entanglement might be relevant at cosmological scales  @xcite , however it is not clear if observations or experiments are possible to measure such entanglement .",
    "see section  [ emm2 ] for some discussion on this issue . )",
    "such an experiment would also have interest from the quantum foundations point of view : performing a long - distance bell test with spacelike separated observers will lead to a paradoxical situation for some interpretations of qm when one considers the problem of measurement . for",
    "two spacelike separated events the concept of simultaneity is frame dependent and external observers in relative motion with respect to the experiment would answer differently to the question `` who measured first ? ''    as discussed in the work of aharonov and albert in the context of quantum mechanics  @xcite , and later by sorkin in the context of quantum field theory  @xcite , assuming that quantum state reduction upon measurement takes place on hyperplanes can lead to causality paradoxes .",
    "however , to the authors knowledge , an experiment testing for such a violation of causality has not yet been performed .",
    "also , these results leave open other plausible hypotheses about quantum state reduction  in particular , that its effects propagate causally  @xcite .",
    "we describe below ( in section  [ macro_amp.sec ] ) experiments testing this possibility .",

    "the first is a symmetric setup , in which the quantum source is placed equidistant from two receivers .",
    "this is conceptually the most simple approach .",
    "a logistically easier ( and therefore cheaper ) alternative is to perform the experiment with one receiver , bob , located at some distance , and a second receiver , alice , at the same site as the entangled photon source .",
    "for example , this might represent satellite and ground receivers , respectively . within this second scenario , however",
    ", if alice s measurement is made on her photon immediately as it emerges from the source , then the two measurement events will not be spacelike separated , and the results from the experiment will be subject to locality and freedom - of - choice loopholes  @xcite .    to close these loopholes , one can insert a delay before alice s measurement , such as a length of fibre - optic cable or a quantum memory device .",
    "the appropriate choice of such a delay makes the measurement events spacelike separated , giving an experimental setup in which both the locality and freedom - of - choice loopholes can be closed while requiring only one measurement to take place at a distant site  @xcite .     and",

    "other interpretations , such as the ensemble interpretation  @xcite or consistent histories  @xcite will be perfectly compatible with the expected outcomes of these experiments  @xcite .",
    "space platforms allow for ( and in some situations , mandate ) relative motion between a pair of observers at different locations with considerably less restriction than on earth . by exploiting this ,",
    "one is able to test interpretations of wave function collapse in scenarios for which the two observers disagree on the relative time ordering of the measurement events .",
    "if the two distant observers measure the photons , events @xmath21 and @xmath22 , under a large relative velocity and spatial separation , then due to special relativity their lines of instantaneity ( isochronous planes ) will become shifted by a measurable amount .",
    "this is a relativistic generalization of bohm s version of the einstein - podolsky - rosen `` paradox '' ; see ref .",
    "@xcite ( section  6.1 ) and figure  [ fig.perestimingparadox ] .",
    "due to the mutual time shifts , the two observers may each measure their particle later than the other ( an `` after - after '' scenario ) in the case that the observers move apart from each other , or each measure their particle earlier than the other ( `` earlier - earlier '' ) , in the case of approaching motion . such experiments were first proposed in 1997 by suarez and scarani  @xcite .",
    "one picture of entanglement has it that the `` first '' measurement influences the outcome of the `` second '' measurement , perhaps non - locally . however , this picture breaks down in a situation in which special relativity mandates that the time - ordering of events is ambiguous .",
    "the probabilities predicted by quantum theory do not depend on the time - ordering of spacelike events , so its predictions will not be changed .",
    "yet this _ timing paradox _ leaves us with some puzzles about understanding the physical reality of quantum states and the non - local collapse of the wave functions .",
    "essentially , in such an experiment we can not even objectively define the non - local update of one system because of the measurements performed on the other .",
    "it is important to note that it is the measurements  external interventions  @xcite into the system  and not entanglement that are responsible for the `` paradox '' .",
    "if a pair of spin - half particles is prepared in a direct product state and the local measurements on the particles are mutually spacelike , then the state of the system does not have a lorentz - covariant transformation law outside the common past and the common future of these interventions  @xcite .",
    "the liouville function of two classical particles that are subject to two mutually spacelike stochastic events has the same property  @xcite .    with space platforms it is possible to reach relative velocities and spatial separations which allow this `` paradoxical '' situation to be observed and explored .",
    "the respective time shift between the two observers by the lorentz transformation is @xmath23 and by setting the origin of reference frame @xmath24 to be zero , we obtain : @xmath25 as an example , by inserting the velocity of @xmath26km / s = 15km / s for the relative motion of two leo satellites , we obtain the following temporal shift per kilometer : @xmath27 assuming fast random number generators and optical switches allow randomly setting the analyzers every 10ns ( which is more than 10 times faster than reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , this would require a minimal separation of the two satellite observers of about 60 km . assuming the measurements can be performed up to the maximal separation for two satellites in leo of about 1500 km , the time available for measurements would be about one and a half minutes , which should be sufficient for a valid bell test .    such an experiment comes with another important requirement , namely that the emission of photon pairs from the source must be very well timed , so that the two photons travel exactly the same time from the source to their respective measurement stations .",
    "the synchronicity requirement is better than 10ns for the shortest separation of 60 km , and expands up to 250ns at 1500 km , which is challenging but seems achievable .      at first sight ,",
    "the quantum projection postulate tells us that something alters when a measurement takes place : the state vector of the measured quantum system changes discontinuously as a result of the measurement .",
    "of course , one view of quantum theory , in line with several different interpretational ideas , is that this `` collapse of the wave function '' is merely a mathematical operation that physicists carry out , and does not represent any real physical process .",
    "while that view may turn out to be correct , it presently leaves us with some fundamental puzzles .",
    "if we can not extract a description of physical reality from the quantum wave function , then how _ do _ we find a description of physical reality within quantum theory ? or if we ca nt , how do we make sense of a fundamental physical theory that does nt describe an objective reality ( and so does nt seem to describe observers or measuring devices either ) ?",
    "but if we _ can _ extract a description of physical reality from the wave function , why would nt we expect that reality to change discontinuously when the wave function does ?",
    "on the other hand , the idea that wave function collapse might be a real physical process also runs into immediate difficulties , one of which is that , as normally formulated , the description of wave function collapse depends on one s choice of reference frame , and so taking it to be real seems to conflict with special relativity .",
    "reviewing all the arguments and counter - arguments and the different interpretational ideas supporting each is beyond our scope here .",
    "we simply want to note an interesting non - standard line of thought about wave function collapse that motivates new experimental tests of quantum theory .    to motivate this",
    ", we first suppose that wave function collapse _ is _ a real objectively defined process , and moreover one that is _ localized _ : collapses occur as the result of events that take place at definite spacetime points .",
    "on this view , collapses are not fundamentally defined in terms of observers or measurements .",
    "the collapse process obeys some as yet unknown mathematical laws  perhaps , for example , some relativistic generalization of the ghirardi - rimini - weber - pearle ( grwp )  @xcite spontaneous collapse models  from which the usual account of collapses taking place as the result of measurements in our experiments emerges as a special case and an approximation .    we also suppose that collapses propagate in a way that respects special relativity . a collapse event at a spacetime point @xmath28 only affects physics in the future light - cone of @xmath28 : in particular",
    ", it does not affect the probabilities of any other collapse events at points spacelike separated from @xmath28 .",
    "taken together , these hypotheses give a way of defining an alternative to standard quantum theory , which we call _ causal quantum theory _",
    ", that makes very different predictions from standard quantum theory  @xcite . to define causal quantum theory precisely",
    ", we would need a precise formulation of the dynamical collapse laws , which needs a relativistic collapse theory .",
    "( so causal quantum theory is really an umbrella term for a class of theories . ) but we can get some intuition about the nature of the alternative by supposing that the existing ( non - relativistic ) grwp models are a good approximation to this unknown relativistic theory for experiments where relativistic quantum effects are relatively negligible .",
    "in particular , we can look at the implications for bell experiments .",
    "causal quantum theory predicts that , in a bell test in which measurements on two separated particles in a singlet state are genuinely completed ( i.e.  the relevant underlying collapse events take place ) in spacelike separated regions , essentially _ no _ correlations will be observed in the measurement outcomes .",
    "observing spin up on one wing does not affect the probabilities of observing spin up or down on the other .",
    "this is , of course , very different from the correlations predicted by standard quantum theory and apparently observed in essentially all bell experiments to date .",
    "it leads to predictions of outcomes that are very unlikely , according to standard quantum theory .",
    "these predictions nonetheless never actually cause a logical contradiction : causal quantum theory is self - consistent  @xcite .    at first sight",
    ", causal quantum theory may seem to be clearly refuted by the overwhelming experimental evidence for bell correlations .",
    "however , this in fact raises a new worry about all existing bell tests : ( how ) _ do _ we know that collapse events sufficient to effectively define an irreversible measurement do in fact take place in spacelike separated regions in the two wings of the experiment ?",
    "is there a possible alternative , namely that the wave function remains uncollapsed until a later point in the measurement chain , when the signals produced in the two wings are brought together and compared ?",
    "if so , causal quantum theory and standard quantum theory would then both predict the standard quantum correlations actually observed .",
    "but then no bell experiment to date would actually have succeeded in demonstrating quantum non - locality .",
    "after all , causal quantum theory is , as its name suggests , a locally causal theory .",
    "if it is consistent with the results of any given experiment , then by definition this experiment can not have demonstrated non - locality in nature .",
    "quantitative estimates suggest this is indeed a live issue , at least in principle . with an appropriate choice of collapse parameters",
    ", grwp models would indeed predict that there are essentially no collapses in spacelike separated regions on the two wings of standard bell test experiments .",
    "for example , neither the avalanches of photons generated by detecting a photon in a photo - multiplier , nor the electrical currents that ensue , are sufficiently macroscopic to ( necessarily ) correspond to a grwp collapse in anything like a sufficiently short time .",
    "there is a loophole  the _ collapse locality loophole _  in all bell experiments to date .",
    "one can find collapse models , and so versions of causal quantum theory , in which none of these experiments would ( essentially ) ever cause spacelike separated collapse events in the two wings .",
    "no collapse occurs , and so no definite outcomes or correlations are generated , until after the signals are brought together and compared . if this description were correct , quantum non - locality would never actually have been demonstrated .    to close this loophole",
    ", one needs to carry out bell tests in which the measurements in the two wings produce _ macroscopically _ distinguishable outcomes in spacelike separated regions . in principle , one simple way to do this , in line with the grwp model and also with penrose  @xcite and diosi s  @xcite intuitions regarding a link between gravitation and collapse , is to arrange experiments so that massive objects are quickly moved to different positions depending on the measurement outcomes . the technological challenge of arranging for a mass to move as the result of a measurement over timescales short compared to terrestrially achievable bell experiment separations is , however , considerable .",
    "nonetheless , salart et  al .",
    "@xcite were able to carry out a beautiful terrestrial experiment , motivated by these ideas , exploiting the rapid deformation of piezocrystals when a signal voltage is applied . in their experiment , a gold - surfaced mirror measuring @xmath29 mm and weighing @xmath30 mg is displaced by a distance of at least @xmath31 nm by a piezocrystal activated by a detector in a bell experiment .",
    "the displacement is complete within @xmath32s after the photon enters the detector . using estimates due to penrose  @xcite and diosi  @xcite for a plausible collapse time if the collapse is related to the gravitational energy of the mass distribution associated with the two superposed mirror states , salart et  al .",
    "obtained a collapse time of 1@xmath20s , suggesting that the measurement is complete and a collapse has taken place within 7.1@xmath20s .",
    "the two wings of their experiment were separated by 18 km , i.e.  @xmath33s , so that on this interpretation the collapses in the two wings are spacelike separated . as their results agreed with standard quantum theory , they refute causal quantum theory for a range of collapse model parameters .    that said , neither penrose nor diosi s estimates derive from a consistent theory of gravity - related collapse .",
    "there are a variety of ways to try to build such models ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "the predicted collapse rates in any given experiment are very sensitive to details of such models , which are not currently fixed by any compelling theoretical principle .",
    "moreover , the earlier grwp collapse models  @xcite ( which do not link collapses directly with gravity ) and other types of collapse model are also well - motivated . for these models too , the predicted collapse rates in any given experiment are very sensitive to uncertain details and ad - hoc choices . for example , one possible extrapolation  @xcite of the original grw collapse model to indistinguishable particles would suggest a collapse time of @xmath34s for the mirror superposition states in the salart et  al .  experiment .",
    "the salart et  al .",
    "experiment has thus by no means closed the collapse locality loophole completely .",
    "to do that , we would need to arrange a bell experiment in which different measurement outcomes produce matter distributions so macroscopically distinct , and in which the separation between the wings is long enough in natural units , that no remotely plausible collapse model can predict that the systems on the two wings remain in superposition throughout the experiment .",
    "this can and presumably ultimately will be achieved by bell experiments based in deep space , with very large separations between the wings .",
    "interestingly , though , even near - earth experiments can achieve a great deal . a bell experiment on a scale of @xmath35@xmath36 km",
    "would be able to exclude any model that predicts collapse times shorter than @xmath37 3300ms .",
    "the upper end of this range compares well with human reaction times ( @xmath38ms ) ; even the lower end compares well to the time required to create an effect on a scale of meters at explosive detonation velocities ( @xmath39@xmath40 m/s ) . to have any plausible motivation ,",
    "a collapse model must produce collapses of macroscopic superpositions perceptible by humans on timescales short compared to those we can discriminate .",
    "a model which fails to do this has to explain why we see definite outcomes while being , at least for some perceptible length of time , actually in indefinite superpositions .",
    "some creative engineering ingenuity is required to devise macroscopic amplifications well suited for near - earth bell experiments , given the constraints of practicality and repeatability .",
    "mechanical amplifications of a detector signal to move macroscopic masses are presumably more practical and more efficient than those relying on human intervention , and more repeatable than those involving explosives . for the moment",
    ", we offer this design problem as a challenge to experimental colleagues , encouraged by the above figures , which suggest that even near - earth , well - designed experiments should be able to close the collapse locality loophole very significantly , and perhaps indeed completely .",

    "to this end , one would perform an eprb - type experiment with such entangled pairs , initially not knowing the curvature along the paths that the entangled particles took on their way from where they were generated to where they were measured .",
    "the aim would be to find and record that relative alignment of the local reference frames which optimizes the eprb effect , i.e.  which corresponds to the correct identification of the local reference frames .",
    "this would constitute a curvature measurement in the following sense .",
    "assume that the curvature between the source of entangled particles and the eprb measurement apparatuses changes .",
    "this could be detected in the eprb experiments on subsequently produced entangled pairs , because for them the optimal alignment of the local @xmath64 axes would be different .",
    "while the effects are tiny , and perhaps classical optical experiments may have a greater chance of success in measuring properties of the gravitational field , using entangled states to probe spacetime geometry is interesting at least as a question of principle .",
    "this proposal is also discussed in ref .",
    "there the authors propose using noon states in an interferometer to enhance the observed signal .    in principle , eprb experiments on entangled pairs of spins that travelled through regions of significant curvature need not only combine curvature with entanglement .",
    "they could also combine curvature and entanglement with quantum delocalization .",
    "this could be achieved if the entangled spins are made each to travel in a wave packet that is as large as the curvature scale . in this case",
    ", there is no unique path that the entangled particles take and therefore the rotation of their spins that arises from the curvature is quantum uncertain . presumably , this still leads to an effectively fixed orientation between the two @xmath64 axes so that the full eprb effect is observed .",
    "that is because as long as the particles do not significantly impact the spacetime , spacetime is not observing and not decohering the particles paths .",
    "this setup is likely to be exceedingly difficult to implement experimentally because of the difficultly of keeping track of individual entangled pairs over scales that are large enough so that the gravitational nontriviality of parallel transport becomes significant .",
    "however , intriguingly , this setup fundamentally involves both quantum and gravity effects without requiring high energies , much less energies close to the planck scale .",

    "@xcite , under these conditions , enough entanglement to violate chsh inequalities can be effectively extracted for any separation distance @xmath134 .",
    "the amount of entanglement that can be achieved between the detectors increases with the frequency gap , so an experiment using atoms whose energy difference between the ground state and first excitation is of the order of visible light will give better results than an experiment using detectors tuned to the microwave or radio spectrum .",

    "however , achieving noise insulation of a quantum channel in space does not seem extremely difficult . in absence of direct solar illumination",
    ", the most important source of noise , the cmb , can be avoided using visible light photons , which are widely detuned from the peak of the cmb spectrum ( a thermal spectrum at @xmath141k ) . of course",

    "provided that the satellites are not receiving direct solar illumination , the noise in the visible light channel can be , at least in principle , kept to a minimum .",

    "colella , overhauser , and werner ( cow ) performed an experiment which observed gravitational phase shift in a neutron beam interferometer  @xcite .",
    "the underlying motivation for this experiment ( repeated with increasing precision over several years  @xcite ) is to test the classical principle of equivalence in the quantum limit . despite many improvements to the original experiment ,",
    "a small discrepancy of 0.60.8% between theory and experiment remains  @xcite .    for a beam of neutrons of mass @xmath49 and wavelength @xmath106 entering an interferometer ,",
    "the phase shift between the two sub - beams is @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the area enclosed by the trajectories of the two sub - beams , @xmath5 is the tilt angle of the interferometer above the horizontal plane and @xmath144 is the acceleration due to gravity .",
    "the second equality follows from the de broglie wavelength formula ( for neutron velocity @xmath13 ) and in this sense the cow experiment can be regarded as a gravitational redshift experiment for massive particles . upon replacing @xmath145 ,",
    "this formula becomes identical to the phase shift formula for photons along different paths in a constant gravitational field  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider an optical version of the cow experiment using transmission of a coherent beam to a satellite in leo  see figure  [ fig.cow ] . at the earth s surface and in the moving satellite",
    "the beam is coherently split by a semitransparent mirror , with one path going through @xmath146 km of optical fibre delay , while the other path is directly transmitted .",
    "the paths are recombined at the end to construct an interferometer .",
    "since the upper fibre sits at a much higher gravitational potential than the lower , it will experience a different phase shift from the one on the ground , which will be picked up by the interferometer .",
    "such an optical cow experiment could provide tests of gravitational redshift in the context of a quantum optics experiment . specifically , in a weak gravitational field the redshift is given by the difference of the newtonian gravitational potentials @xmath147 on the ground and at the satellite s orbit , = , where @xmath144 is the free fall acceleration on the earth s surface and @xmath148 is the altitude of the satellite .",
    "the resulting phase difference between the two paths is @xmath149 , where @xmath41 is the wave number .",
    "hence , taking the wavelength @xmath150 nm and the altitude @xmath151 km , one obtains quite a considerable phase difference : = ~2 .",
    "furthermore , due to the large speed of the satellite ( ca .",
    "8km / s ) it will have moved by about 15 cm ( depending on the exact location of the satellite when the photons reach it ) while the interferometer is closed , which effectively extends the satellite based delay .",
    "this has two consequences : first that the interferometer paths now cover an actual area and could be sensitive to rotational effects , and second , that in order to calibrate for zero - path - length , this delay , and consequently the satellite speed , must be very accurately measured , which could provide useful information for analysis of satellite motion .",
    "note that this optical cow interferometry experiment would be carried out over much larger distances so that the earth s gravitational field is not constant .",
    "the phase shift detected would then be general - relativistic as opposed to one due to an accelerated frame ( which the constant field near the earth s surface is equivalent to ) .",

    "an accelerated observer in the field vacuum as defined by an inertial observer would experience a thermal bath in a phenomenon analogous to the hawking effect in a black hole .",

    "the first order effect of this thermalization is to act as a source of local noise in any mode of the field that may be probed by an accelerated detector .",
    "a more interesting effect is one in which ( depending on the initial state of the field ) a system initially prepared in an entangled state in an inertial frame may experience a variation in its degree of entanglement when measured by receivers that are in relative acceleration . in the simplest scenario with a maximally entangled state of the field , it has been shown that entanglement degrades due to the presence of this unruh noise  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the acceleration necessary to observe these effects in , for example , an entangled state of the electromagnetic field  @xcite in a field mode of frequency @xmath160 is @xmath161 which for a field mode in the mhz spectrum would mean an acceleration of approximately @xmath162 .",
    "this is already much smaller that the acceleration @xmath163 that one needs in order to observe a thermal bath warmer than the cmb .",
    "however it is still too large to contemplate direct observation in the gravitational field of any celestial body within the solar system . a satellite - based experiment aiming to look for the resulting loss of entanglement between an accelerating receiver on the earth s surface and an inertial observer in orbit would be unable to see this effect .",
    "the preceding results were obtained using what is known as the `` single mode approximation '' ( sma )  @xcite .",

    "for instance , it has been shown that beyond sma and for some choices of the bipartite state , the accessible entanglement for an accelerated observer may behave in a non - monotonic way , conversely to the first results reported in refs .",
    "this is due to inaccessible correlations in the initial states becoming accessible to the accelerated observer when his proper fock basis changes as acceleration varies  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , while the idealized quantum field modes used in previous studies are arguably impossible to reproduce in any experimental setting ( due to their non - localized and highly oscillating spatial profiles  @xcite ) , the study of the behaviour of localized field states has just recently started .",
    "several novel proposals have the edge on idealized scenarios for experiments where these effects can be detected .",
    "this is the case of localized projective measurements  @xcite , homodyne detection schemes  @xcite and accelerated cavities  @xcite . in the latter case , there are very promising results regarding entanglement being generated instead of destroyed due to relativistic accelerations of optical cavities that can be , in principle , made detectable with relatively smaller accelerations  @xcite .",
    "however , concrete experimental proposals for the direct detection of these phenomena are still to be developed and it is not clear that with these settings we could take any advantage of the variations of the gravitational field strength in a solar - system based satellite experiment",
    ".    nevertheless , an experimental test aiming to detect the unruh effect can make use of the unique gravitational environment provided by a satellite platform .",
    "some of the proposed experiments that have emerged from the field of relativistic quantum information require high - precision measurements .",

    "this experiment exploits the fact that a detector acquires a geometrical phase due to its motion in spacetime .",

    "this method is sensitive to accelerations @xmath167 times smaller than other suggested attempts to probe this effect  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the necessary precision in the relative phase between these detectors is so high ( @xmath168 to @xmath169 ) that earth s gravity can interfere with the reading of the atomic interferometer required for detection  @xcite : the interferometer could be sensitive to variations in the gravitational field of order @xmath170  @xcite .",
    "however , the freely - falling environment of the satellite would significantly reduce such interference , providing a great advantage for a realistic experimental proposal .",
    "while this experiment does not directly probe physics at large length scales by performing inter - satellite quantum communication , we deem it important for ( 1 ) its apparent need for a free - falling space environment , and ( 2 ) its attempt to directly explore the effect of acceleration on quantum entanglement",
    ".      the standard description of quantum fields in curved spacetime  @xcite allows quantum entanglement to survive unchecked in a wide variety of gravitational backgrounds . in principle , then , entangled photons created locally and transmitted to regions of different gravitational potential will still possess all the entanglement they started with , and local detectors can be suitably designed that will reveal this .",
    "this would be challenging , of course , but such designs are at the heart of most every proposal in this article .",
    "an alternative formulation of the behaviour of photons in curved spacetime was proposed by ralph in a series of papers  @xcite originally designed to deal with the hypothetical question of quantum information propagation through closed timelike curves but later revealed to predict measurable decoherence induced by gravitation .",
    "the essence of the proposal is to supplement ordinary field theory with an additional degree of freedom called an _ event operator _ , which is associated with the detectors used to measure the field quanta in a given setup .",
    "in flat spacetime with detectors in the same reference frame , the event operator is of no consequence because time passes identically for all detectors .",
    "but when two detectors are in regions of differing gravitational potential , their local clocks run at different rates and fall out of sync , little by little .",
    "when the amount by which they desynchronize during the photons times of flight is longer than the timing resolution of the detector , then , although the delay in the time of arrival can be accounted for in the detector design , the presence of the event operator ( whose duration is associated to the detector s temporal resolution ) ensures that the two photons lose coherence .    the scheme proposed in ref .",

    "due to the careful timing required , this scheme is challenging but possibly doable .",
    "it is interesting to note that the predicted decoherence induced by gravity applies only to quantum entanglement , and is in addition to any spreading of classical correlations .",

    "however , a single comoving detector would constitute a poor probe for the structure of the spacetime .",
    "for instance , in the scenario mentioned above , particle detection would be not be enough to distinguish an exponentially expanding universe from a thermal source in a flat spacetime .",
    "on the other hand , using entanglement induced in spacelike separated detectors  @xcite , a way to distinguish the conformal vacuum of a scalar field in a desitter universe from a thermal bath in flat spacetimes was proposed : while a detector sees the same thermal bath in both scenarios , the way in which two separated detectors become entangled senses a difference .",
    "this is just an example of a more general phenomenon still to be explored : quantum correlations acquired by spacelike separated detectors interacting with the same quantum field  @xcite are dramatically sensitive to the spacetime background and the state of motion of the detectors .",
    "for instance , it has been argued that due to general relativistic effects , two counter - accelerating detectors can extract more entanglement from the vacuum state than inertial ones  @xcite .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that no quantitative results in realistic regimes has been obtained yet : to reproduce the scenario depicted in ref .",

    "these results will tell us how much sensitivity such a hypothetical experiment should have .    while potentially useful as tools to probe the geometry of the spacetime provided our ability to measure those correlations , all these experiments are subjected to the same spacelike separation loopholes as those described in section  [ emm1 ] .",

    "this is because cosmic inflation holds that this curl field originated in a clean quantum gravity effect , namely in quantum fluctuations of the tensor - derived part of the metric during the very early inflationary phase of the universe . in the longer term",
    "it is indeed conceivable that a quantum gravitational effect could be observed in the cmb polarization spectrum .",
    "this is because the quantum fluctuations that ultimately caused the temperature fluctuations in the cmb were frozen in magnitude when their wavelength was that of the hubble length during inflation .",
    "several independent arguments suggest that the planck - scale structure of spacetime should not be describable as an ordinary smooth pseudo - riemannian geometry , as a result of the interplay between quantum theory and general relativity , both of which possess physical effects that would be non - negligible at the planck scale .",
    "several alternative models for the description of the planck - scale structure of spacetime have been developed over the years , and a detection of some manifestation of such an underlying alternate spacetime structure would have enormous scientific impact , in that it would be an important clue toward the construction of a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "the correct prediction of the order of magnitude of the cosmic acceleration  @xcite may be interpreted as initial observational evidence that spacetime possesses some non - smooth structure around the planck scale .",
    "successful paradigms for the exploration of these issues for the planck - scale structure of spacetime are `` spacetime discreteness '' , `` spacetime noncommutativity '' , and a third , which posits that spacetime is simultaneously continuous and discrete , in the same mathematical way that information can have this character  @xcite .    a theoretical signature of the third type of ultraviolet cutoff is the deformation of the uncertainty principle so that it yields a finite lower bound on position uncertainties  @xcite .",

    "the alternative of studies of spacetime noncommutativity finds motivation in the study of the 3d - quantum - gravity toy model .",
    "recent results establish that for 3d quantum gravity ( exploiting its much greater simplicity than the 4d case ) one is able to integrate out gravity , reabsorbing its effects into novel properties for a gravity - free propagation of particles .",
    "the resulting noncommutative spacetime picture is affected by two main features :    1 .",
    "the spacetime symmetries are described by a hopf algebra ( rather than admitting the standard lie - algebra description ) and in particular lorentz symmetry is deformed ; 2 .",
    "the fuzziness of worldlines receives a planck - scale contribution ( in addition to the one of ordinary quantum - mechanical origin ) .",
    "thus the spacetime - noncommutativity programme can motivate searches for departures from classical ( lie - algebra - described ) lorentz symmetry , and searches for effects linked with the additional source of worldline fuzziness , such as minute losses of quantum - mechanical coherence .",
    "the setup with a weak coherent pulse of photons discussed in the previous subsection is also of interest from the perspective of spacetime noncommutativity .",
    "as mentioned , the planck - scale - induced fuzziness of worldlines is expected to effectively produce loss of quantum - mechanical coherence , which should grow over macroscopic distances : on table - top experiments the effects would be completely negligible because of the planck - scale suppression , but there would be significant interest in bounds established using the large distances involved in a satellite setup .    it is likely that definite predictions , which therefore could be used to set bounds on the relevant parameters , will mature over the next two or three years , taking as starting point preliminary results such as those in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "deformations of lorentz symmetry of the type motivated by spacetime - noncommutativity generate interest in the recent proposal of the `` relative - locality framework ''  @xcite . in this proposal one",
    "endows momentum space with the role of `` primitive '' entity for the definition of physical observables , with spacetime only introduced as a derived entity .",
    "the geometry of momentum space , assumed to be non - trivial ( i.e.  different from the trivial flat / minkowskian geometry usually assumed for momentum space ) , takes center stage , with the planck scale playing the role of scale of curvature of momentum space .",
    "several features of the geometry of momentum space could be of interest for setups suitable for satellite operation . a particularly interesting setup from this perspective is the one of interferometers studying phase differences produced through splitting beams in energy space ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "in such setups , a monochromatic wave with frequency @xmath160 goes through two or more frequency doublers ( or even `` comb '' generators ) so that in the end one can perform interference studies on beams ( thereby produced by splitting the original beam in energy space ) which follow the same path in spacetime , but different paths in energy - momentum space .",
    "if the geometry of momentum space is indeed nontrivial , with planck - scale curvature , such setups should produce testable features .",
    "the features would once again be tiny for table - top experiments , but potentially observable for satellite setups .",
    "quantum information allows one to perform communication tasks that are beyond the possibilities of classical systems .",
    "one such example is quantum cryptography , or more correctly titled quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , in which secure keys are established using non - orthogonality of quantum mechanical signal states  @xcite .",
    "such states can be easily created using optical signals .",
    "the non - orthogonality of the signals ensures that no eavesdropping can be performed without introducing changes to the signals .",
    "performing such quantum protocols with satellites is an important application , because it can allow for expansion of a potential service to global scales .",
    "when such quantum applications are implemented in space , all the physical phenomena that affect the photons and their quantum states must be understood and accounted for such that one can reliably model the effective quantum channel to achieve the desired performance .",
    "many proposals for qkd using satellites have been studied theoretically and with proof - of - principle experiments , e.g.  refs .",
    "we therefore refer the reader to these references for more details .",
    "the extensive analysis of the quantum link performance provided in those references shows that it should be feasible to exchange several millions of secure bits per month with a quantum satellite located in leo .",
    "using a satellite in geo is very interesting too as its stationary location allows better accessibility of the system .",
    "another important scenario is to send two entangled photons from the satellite towards two ground stations , enabling them to use the quantum correlations directly to generate secure keys on the ground without having to trust the security of the satellite .",
    "an entangled photon source in space could achieve useful key rates ( several kb per month ) depending on the technology that is implemented , and is currently envisioned in the space - quest project being pursued in europe  @xcite .",
    "many of the most interesting recent developments in quantum cryptography make use of relativistic signalling constraints as well as the properties of quantum information to ensure security .",
    "typically , these schemes become more efficient and easier to implement when the separations between secure sites become large , so that the delays caused by generating and processing signals are small compared to the separations . in particular , space - based implementations are more efficient than terrestrial implementations",
    ".    satellite - based implementations are also particularly natural for the recently proposed protocols for _ quantum tagging _ ( also called quantum position authentication ) .",
    "the aim of these protocols is to guarantee the location of a valuable ( or perhaps dangerous ) object or person by exchanging signals with distant secure sites .",
    "for example , one might want to establish a secure satellite network to verify the location of objects or people on earth , taking advantage both of the security offered by satellites ( which can not easily be hijacked or compromised , and especially not without detection ) and of the large area of earth in their direct line of sight .",
    "quantum tagging protocols  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for independent proposals ) aim to use the properties of quantum information and the impossibility of superluminal signalling to guarantee the location of an object that is distant from trusted secure sites .",
    "these protocols are designed to deal with an adversarial scenario , in which an enemy may be trying to relocate the object while fooling the tracker by sending fake messages and images .",
    "( for example , a tagged prisoner wishing to escape might spoof his tagging device so as to persuade the authorities that he remains in custody . )    the overall level of security attainable depends on the properties of the tag  @xcite .",
    "in one interesting and practical scenario , the tag is assumed able to contain secret data .",
    "this allows perfectly secure tagging in any region within the convex interior of the set defined by the secure signalling sites  within a tetrahedron , for example , for four non - coplanar sites .",
    "the resources required are ( only ) a qkd link between one site and the tagged object , together with ( approximately ) light speed classical communication between the object and all four sites .",
    "indeed , a technological proof of principle could be achieved using a single satellite and two ground stations , with a qkd link between the satellite and one ground station , together with light speed communications ( for example line of sight radio or light pulse signals ) between the satellite and both stations .",
    "quantum teleportation allows the transfer of an arbitrary and unknown quantum state from one location to another through the use of an entangled pair resource  @xcite . by doing a joint bell state measurement on the quantum state and one half of an entangled pair and sending the measurement results to a user with the other half of the entangled pair",
    ", the distant user can can recover the original quantum state .",
    "the key operation for this protocol is the bell state measurement , which imprints the quantum information of the original photon onto the entangled photon pair , one half of which is transmitted to the receiver .",
    "standard quantum theory places no bound on the distance at which teleportation may be accomplished .",
    "this process is highly interesting from a fundamental viewpoint , but also a crucial concept for interlinking quantum computers using quantum networks .",
    "experiments have been performed on the ground up to a distance of 143 km  @xcite , and in principle could be extended further . however , as with other experiments , planetary extents limit the feasibly achievable teleportation distance that can be tested . moving to a satellite platform as either source or receiver ( or both ) significantly raises these limits .    in a downlink scenario ,",
    "a source of entangled photons would be placed on the satellite with one half of the entangled pair being sent to a ground station over the free - space link .",
    "the ground station would have its own photon source to generate the quantum state which is to be teleported .",
    "the ground station would interfere the received photon from the entangled pair with the photon meant to be teleported in a joint bell state measurement .",
    "the results of the measurement would then be sent over the classical communication channel to the satellite .",
    "there are then two options on the satellite , either    1 .",
    "the second photon from the pair generated on the satellite could be stored in a quantum memory ( in this case perhaps a polarization stabilized optical fibre ) until the classical measurement results were received allowing the correct feed - forward operation to be applied in all cases to recover the teleported quantum state , or 2 .",
    "no quantum memory would be used and the data would be post - selected onto those cases where the classical measurement results indicated that no correction operation needed to be performed .",
    "the satellite would also require the necessary equipment to analyze the final state of the teleported photon to verify that the teleportation protocol succeeded .    in an uplink scenario ,",
    "the entangled photon pair source would remain on the ground while the satellite would contain a receiver system as well as an extra photon source capable of creating the quantum state which was to be teleported .",
    "the satellite would receive one half of the photon pair via the free - space link and perform a joint bell state measurement on it along with a photon from the extra quantum source .",
    "the results of the measurement would then be classically communicated to the ground station .",
    "lastly , the ground station would analyze the state of the photon with quantum state tomography to ascertain that the photon state was in fact successfully teleported .",
    "the advantage of this scenario is that there would be far fewer limitations on storing the photon that remained at the ground station in a quantum memory and it would be possible to utilize the latest technology .",
    "this would mean that it would be much more likely to perform an experiment that allowed the ground station to perform the necessary feed - forward correction in order to recover the teleported quantum state in all cases rather than post - selecting only those cases for which no correction was necessary .",
    "the obvious disadvantage is the practical complication of having apparatuses to perform a bell state measurement on the satellite .",
    "we may further consider an entanglement swapping scenario , where a satellite could receive two photons from independent ground stations and perform the bell state measurement , entangling the remaining photons between the two stations .",
    "this requires quantum memories such that the photons on the ground can be stored until the bell state measurement is performed .",
    "such a scenario would be an important step towards the long - term goal of realizing global quantum repeater networks .",
    "the satellite would serve to establish an elementary link between two ground stations separated by a large distance .",
    "several such links could then be connected by entanglement swapping operations between memories on the ground in order to establish entanglement over global distances on earth .",
    "such a satellite - based approach to quantum repeaters would be significantly more powerful than an approach based purely on optical fibres on the ground , as reviewed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite .    note that , in all the proposed experiments , the bell state measurement would involve at least one photon that has travelled over a long distance ( from the satellite to the ground or from the ground to the satellite respectively ) .",
    "this is qualitatively different from recent ground - based long - distance teleportation experiments @xcite , where entanglement creation and bell state measurement were performed at the same location .",
    "the applications of quantum teleportation between a satellite and the earth s surface will most likely become very relevant once quantum information processors are widely deployed and need to be interconnected . in the intervening time",
    ", it will have a very important motivational impact for generating interest in this research , perhaps even more so than its direct impact on our understanding of fundamental physics .",
    "the importance of quantum teleportation experiments could therefore extend beyond its value as a direct test of physical theory or in providing a useful service .",
    "the ideas mentioned in this section can be thought of more as techniques which may be useful for achieving the scientific aims of some of the other experiments mentioned , rather than as experiments in and of themselves .",
    "however , the physics described in each could be tested directly by experiment .",
    "the transmission of quantum states among parties in earth orbit and on the ground is complicated by the fact that the observers do not have an obvious shared lorentz frame against which to perform their measurements .",
    "it is possible to avoid this difficulty by encoding qubits into a noiseless subsystem of several particles , in such a way that the subsystem is invariant under lorentz transformations  @xcite .",
    "using the fact that photons of opposite helicities acquire opposite phases ( section  [ lorentz - polar ] ) , an encoding of one logical qubit into two physical qubits makes the knowledge of the relative orientation and velocities of the lorentz frames redundant . by utilizing this technique , parties can exchange entangled qubits without caring about the relative lorentz transformation which relates their respective reference frames .    for the various experiments one can then decide whether the effect of the lorentz transformations are of interest , and separate it out when desired .",
    "thus one could isolate different effects with the same orbital scenario , depending on interest .",
    "the noiseless subsystem method is also applicable to the gravitomagnetic phase ( section  [ frame_dragging.sec ] ) .",
    "it is not clear what the effect of relative acceleration on these encoded states would be .",
    "one could presume this leads to higher order corrections .",
    "this question should be investigated .",
    "spekkens et  al .",
    "have proposed an alternative to the eprb experiment which , rather than directly testing the bell inequalities , tests a `` preparation contextuality '' inequality , whose violation by quantum mechanics manifests a sort of quantum entanglement  @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup is much simpler , consisting of a state preparation by one party , followed by a single measurement of a second party .",
    "the intent is to send `` parity - oblivious '' quantum information about a bit string to a second party , who then queries the information by performing a measurement on the received quantum state .",
    "the major advantage of this technique is that it allows considerably greater accuracy over the more conventional eprb - type experiment .",
    "one has achieved 98% of the quantum bound on the preparation contextuality inequality  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the improved accuracy will be important for testing unknown physics in some of the proposed experiments .",
    "a downside is that it is more difficult to see exactly what is being ruled out by this test .",
    "it is only relevant to some loopholes of the eprb experiment .",
    "in particular , the condition of `` locality '' is replaced by a parity obliviousness condition . while the former is easy to determine by simply checking for spacelike separation of the two measurement events , it is not obvious how to physically determine if the transmission is truly parity oblivious .",
    "to implement the experiments that will investigate the various effects described in the preceding sections , the necessary technologies must be engineered . in some cases , the necessary technology already exists sufficient to demonstrate the expected effects , and experiments could be carried out in the near term ( granted appropriate funding ) .",
    "indeed , proposals for such near - term space - based quantum missions are presently being evaluated by the csa , the european space agency ( esa ) , and others . on the other hand",
    ", some experiments will require technological capabilities that are not currently available , and such missions will necessarily be long - term .",
    "one notable challenge stems from the fact that the expected observations require precise knowledge of position , orientation , and/or timing in order to reach the maximal level predicted , or in some case to even be significantly evident beyond random statistical variation .",
    "the challenge facing space experiments is the difficulty of performing this reference frame alignment without invoking the quantum effects that the experiment itself aims to demonstrate ( and thereby maintaining the validity of the experiment s results ) .",
    "the alignment of source and receivers for quantum signals should be based on an independent , common reference , e.g.  surrounding fixed stars and other celestial objects .",
    "even with the precise reference frame alignment , the quantum effects that we expect to observe will , in most cases , remain very small .",
    "the challenge in this situation is , then , to convincingly distinguish between the quantum contributions and statistical noise within the experimental measurements . for experiments utilizing orbiting satellites , a potential avenue to aid",
    "this task is to utilize the inevitable variation in the satellite s orbit .",
    "because the quantum effects of interest have dependence on the height and/or speed of the apparatus , with a suitably eccentric elliptical orbit , a pattern would emerge within the oscillations of the measurement data , correlating to the orbital position of the satellite .    with or without such tricks ,",
    "a minimum number of measurements would be necessary to achieve statistical significance in most cases . in the case of bell tests ( section  [ sec : belltest ] )",
    ", the number of measurements required to achieve a significant ( at least @xmath212 ) violation of the bell inequality depends on the fidelity of the quantum signals received . utilizing the poissonian statistical nature of photon detections , error propagation through the correlation functions that make up the bell inequality leads to the conclusion that @xmath213 photons must be detected , given an experimental entanglement visibility @xmath203 ( see figure  [ fig : requirednforbell ] ) .     required in order to achieve a 3@xmath214 violation of the bell inequality , given an entanglement visibility @xmath203.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      as in any experiment , there will be inevitable imperfections in the design and manufacture of components , their calibration , and their operation . moreover , there also exist physical restrictions ( for example , the diffraction limit ) that bound the precision of measurements that can be made using practical apparatuses",
    ". these effects will add noise and uncertainty to the results obtained from any experimental apparatus deployed in a space platform .",
    "how do we then separate the `` regular '' sources of noise from any as yet unknown decoherence effect ?",
    "such a discussion may require careful and thorough theoretical analysis encompassing all the known noise contributions , e.g.  photon loss , erroneous detection of background light and thermally induced ( dark ) counts .",
    "all these effects introduce a predictable amount of noise , thus degrading the entanglement visibility .",
    "however , the measurement of significant deviation from the expected degradation would be indicative of new physics ( assuming the models are as complete as possible ) .      proposals for future missions to test quantum effects in space are currently being considered by a number of space agencies worldwide .",
    "these missions will , if implemented , make substantial primary steps in observations of large - scale quantum effects .",
    "space - quest ( `` quantum entanglement for space experiments '' ) , an initiative of the esa and led by the institute for quantum optics and quantum information in vienna , proposes to place an entangled photon pair source on the international space station ( iss )  @xcite .",
    "it would possess two independently orientable telescopes of 1015 cm diameter which will transmit the entangled photons to ground receivers at locations separated by over 1000 km , allowing long - distance bell tests , quantum key distribution , and other science experiments .",
    "a notably simpler approach is being considered by the csa .",
    "the qeyssat ( `` quantum encryption and science satellite '' ) proposal , led by the institute for quantum computing in waterloo , reverses the direction of the quantum transmission , placing the complicated parts of the apparatus  the photon source  on the ground , and the simple part  the photon receiver  on a microsatellite in a noon - midnight leo orbit .",
    "this approach experiences higher loss compared to space - quest s downlink approach , but it also possesses several practical advantages in source interchangeability and ease of maintenance on the ground , as well as lower space , power , and classical processing requirements on the satellite . despite its simplified nature , qeyssat will also allow testing of long distance entanglement ( also over 1000 km ) , and other scientific questions such as ralph s gravity - induced entanglement decorrelation ( section  [ sec.ralph ] ) and simultaneity paradoxes .",
    "the advent of technologies which enable quantum communication in space has the potential to open a new chapter in the development of our understanding of the physical world .",
    "tests of quantum phenomena are no longer bound to laboratory settings , allowing us to explore the nature of the quantum world at increasingly large length scales . in doing so",
    ", there lies before us the potential to find new revelations affecting the foundations of quantum field theory and general relativity , largely unchanged for almost a century , that now form the pillars of modern physics .",
    "we have discussed a wide variety of potential experiments to probe physics in every known regime , from ordinary non - relativistic quantum mechanics to ideas stemming from various attempts to reconcile gravitational physics with quantum theory . for most experiments we attempt to indicate its feasibly in terms of technology required , and the magnitude of an effect which one might hope to measure .",
