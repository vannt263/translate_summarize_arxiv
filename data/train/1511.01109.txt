    "if we increase the input power , the both sidebands tends to move towards @xmath153 because of the decrease in the spectral strength of quasi - particles due to quantum fluctuations of the system , as can be seen in fig .",
    "it is , intuitively , referred to the scattering of intra - cavity optical mode at bragg planes in the density - modulated cloud .",

    "6(b ) , where the the so - coupling is @xmath156 .",
    "it can also be noted that the spectral strength of both sidebands as well as secondary structure is increased by the existence of so - coupling .",
