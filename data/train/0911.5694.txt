    "in their seminal work @xcite , kazhdan and lusztig defined for any coxeter group @xmath4 a class of polynomials indexed by @xmath5 now known as the kazhdan - lusztig polynomials of @xmath4 .",
    "these polynomials are usually defined in terms of an auxiliary set of polynomials , the @xmath3-polynomials , also indexed by @xmath5 .    in 1987",
    ", deodhar introduced parabolic analogs of these sets of polynomials in @xcite , which he referred to as the relative @xmath3-polynomials and relative kazhdan - lusztig polynomials .",
    "the relative polynomials reduce to the standard ones in the case that a trivial parabolic subgroup of @xmath4 is used . he provided a recursive calculation for these polynomials similar to the original formulations of kazhdan and lusztig .    in @xcite , proctor obtained the hasse diagrams of quotient bruhat orders that constituted lattices , and in @xcite , he gave a combinatorial game which again yielded these lattices , but with an explicit description of the reduced decompositions of the elements of @xmath2 associated to hermitian symmetric pairs . in @xcite",
    ", jakobsen found the same diagrams as the lattices of noncompact positive roots , where he referred to these diagrams as being of hermitian type , a practice we will continue in this paper .",
    "the diagrams , or at least their outlines , have since appeared in many different contexts , including @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",

    "let @xmath6 be a complex simple lie algebra , @xmath7 a maximal parabolic subalgebra with levi decomposition @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the subalgebra whose basis is the root spaces spanned by compact roots , and @xmath10 the subalgebra corresponding subalgebra for the span of the noncompact roots .",
    "it is well - known that the following conditions are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath11 is a ( complexified ) hermitian symmetric pair , 2 .",
    "@xmath10 is abelian , 3 .",
    "the associated flag manifold @xmath12 is cominiscule .",
    "this equivalence connects jakobsen s work , which centered on the positive noncompact roots of simple complex lie algebras , and proctor s , which focused on the combinatorics of cominiscule flag varieties . in this work , if @xmath4 is the weyl group of @xmath13 , and @xmath14 the weyl group of @xmath15 , and @xmath12 is cominiscule , we abuse notation and refer to the quotient @xmath2 as a hermitian symmetric pair .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the relative @xmath3-polynomials for hermitian symmetric pairs by means of a marking algorithm on diagrams of hermitian type .",
    "in particular , for @xmath2 a hermitian symmetric pair , and @xmath16 in @xmath2 , we show that there are canonically obtained diagrams @xmath17 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 such that @xmath17 is contained within @xmath19 , and the corners of the skew diagram @xmath21 along its northwest edges determine the relative @xmath3-polynomial @xmath22 completely . as an application of the algorithm , we prove that in this situation , @xmath23 is dependent only on the poset isomorphism class of @xmath0 $ ] .",

    "this settles the question of combinatorial invariance for the relative @xmath3-polynomials for @xmath2 a hermitian symmetric pair in a uniform way . as relative kazhdan - lusztig polynomials are sums of relative @xmath3-polynomials , their combinatorial invariance follows .",
    "it should be mentioned that a different combinatorial derivation of the @xmath3-polynomials has been recently published by f. brenti ( for @xmath27 , see @xcite , for all other types , see @xcite ) .",
    "the algorithm we give has the benefit of being uniform for all types including @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "this fact was shown by proctor , and the following is essentially a restatement of @xcite , proposition 3.2 .",

    "[ diagrams ] a _ subdiagram _ of one of the above hermitian type diagrams is a subset of the given diagram such that , if a box @xmath89 is in the subdiagram , every box located above and left of @xmath89 is also in the subdiagram .",

    "a _ partition _ is a diagram with its labels removed .",

    ", it makes sense to make the following definition :    the _ partition of a permutation @xmath47 _ is the partition underlying the diagram associated to @xmath47 through the bijection detailed in the following section .",
    "the next definitions will only be used in section [ combinv ] , but we state them now for completeness .",
    "we say that a partition is _ standard _ if it is a young tableau under the usual definition ( i.e. consists of a top and left justified set of rows , weakly decreasing in length ) .",

    "the support for the skew diagram for @xmath98 where @xmath18 and @xmath20 are specific elements of some quotient @xmath58 is the set of simple reflections that appear in the filling of @xmath98 .",
    "an alternate realization of the diagrams of hermitian type can be had by modifying a sorting game developed by eriksson and eriksson ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 9 ) .",
    "we begin by noting that each weyl group can be associated to a permutation group : @xmath99 with the symmetric group on @xmath100 letters , etc .",

    "the rows in the constructed tableau correspond to rows in the above diagrams in a natural way , and because we are working in hermitian symmetric spaces , the bruhat and weak bruhat orders coincide on these quotients , allowing us to read the left descent sets of each element from the diagram ( see proposition [ ordertheorem ] ) . furthermore , because the sorting game is modeling multiplication in the weyl group , the diagrams we derive can be associated to reduced decompositions .",
    "this will be a central tool in the statement and proof of the main theorem .",

    "write @xmath105 for the image of @xmath47 under the action of the permutation @xmath47 ; if @xmath47 is written in complete notation , we see this is just the @xmath106 entry in @xmath47 .",
    "define a game on @xmath92 in the following way : in step one , sort @xmath107 into the segment @xmath108 $ ] , and record the number of elements `` jumped '' as @xmath109 .",
    "call the resulting permutation @xmath110 , and sort @xmath111 into the segment @xmath112 $ ] , again recording the number of jumped elements as @xmath113 . as @xmath114 by assumption , @xmath115 .",
    "continue until the permutation is completely sorted , leaving a partition @xmath116 .",
    "note that @xmath117 , and that @xmath118 if and only if @xmath47 was sorted before any action was taken ( which implies that @xmath47 is the identity ) .    each sort can be realized as multiplication by a specific product of simple reflections ; in particular , the action of sorting position @xmath119 to position @xmath120 is @xmath121 , corresponding to the diagram row word @xmath122 thus we can associate to each partition an element of @xmath58 by @xmath123 and so we have a map @xmath124 where the labeling is exactly as in section [ hsdiag ] .",
    "this map is easily shown to be bijective .",
    "all further cases are similar , and so we give only the map @xmath125      here , @xmath4 can be viewed as weyl group of type @xmath127 , i.e. permutations of @xmath128 with @xmath129 , and where we take @xmath130 .",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath168 .",
    "given a permutation @xmath47 , we have a two - step method of sorting : first , let @xmath169 , and @xmath170 , and begin by sorting @xmath171 into @xmath172 , noting @xmath109 as one more than the number of jumped elements , and denote the resulting permutation as @xmath173 ( note that @xmath174 ) .",

    "let @xmath261 be the function defined as @xmath22 , but with @xmath262 for all @xmath238 .",
    "we provide several examples to aid in the discussion :      consider @xmath263 , @xmath264 in @xmath265 .",
    "again , we use the convention of using @xmath266 for @xmath185",
    ". then    @xmath267    and @xmath268 .",
    "let @xmath269 and @xmath270 in @xmath271 .",
    "then we have @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "take @xmath274 and @xmath275 in @xmath28 . then @xmath276 and @xmath277 .",
    "let @xmath278 and @xmath279 in @xmath28",
    ". then @xmath280 with @xmath281 .",
    "we will show that @xmath282 obeys the recursions required by the relative @xmath3-polynomials .",
    "one case of the recursion is trivial , and will be treated case independently in proposition [ triv ] .",
    "the strategy for the proof of the other recursive rules is as follows : we identify the possible diagrammatic presentations of each rule , and reduce to a trivial identity about quantum integers .",
    "the discussion in section [ restriction ] will detail how we can restrict the skew diagram associated to the pair @xmath16 to a smaller diagram and prove the recursion there .",
    "we can show that the @xmath283-polynomials satisfy the second recursive relation in deodhar s definition of relative @xmath3-polynomials without appealing to any particular hermitian symmetric pair .",
    "[ triv ] let @xmath73 with @xmath16 , and suppose that @xmath284 , and that @xmath285 .",
    "then @xmath286 .",
    "if @xmath19 and @xmath17 are the diagrams for @xmath20 and @xmath18 respectively , the situation in the proposition is that there is an @xmath238-labeled outside corner of @xmath20 that is neither an inside or outside corner of @xmath18 .",
    "thus the @xmath238-labeled boxes in @xmath21 are not marked with @xmath251 or @xmath252 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath287 is the diagram for @xmath288 , the only difference between @xmath19 and @xmath287 is a single unmarked box , implying that @xmath289",
    ". then the only difference between @xmath282 and @xmath290 is a single factor of @xmath291 , yielding the result .",

    "suppose furthermore that @xmath58 is not @xmath28 or @xmath295 .",
    "if @xmath235 , then there is an @xmath238-labeled outer corner in @xmath17 . then the skew diagram @xmath21 differs from @xmath296 in the diagonal containing that outside corner , and possibly in the diagonals immediately above and below this diagonal . the upper diagonal differs if @xmath297 and @xmath298 , where @xmath243 is the label of the box immediately right of the @xmath238-labeled outside corner in the diagram for @xmath18 , and a similar condition holds for the lower diagonal .    in almost the same way , if @xmath284 , and @xmath234 , the diagrams @xmath21 , @xmath299 , and @xmath296 differ at most on the diagonal of @xmath21 containing the @xmath238-labeled outside corner , and on the diagonals immediately above and below it .",
    "thus the difference in the polynomials @xmath282 , @xmath300 , and @xmath301 is determined by markings that differ on at most three diagonals .",
    "we refer to this set of diagonals as @xmath302 , and define @xmath303 to be the polynomial determined by the markings on the diagonals in @xmath302 .      with this remark in hand , we can take on the next case of the recursion for @xmath22 .",

    "@xmath306 , implying @xmath234 , so in particular the diagram for @xmath248 is contained within the diagram of @xmath18 , and is in fact obtained by deleting the @xmath238-labeled outside corner .",
    "let @xmath307 , @xmath308 , and @xmath309 are the diagrams associated to @xmath310 , and @xmath248 , respectively . analyzing the diagrams of section [ hsdiag ] , we see the following marked diagrams . note that we draw only the three relevant diagonals , and do not cover the cases @xmath28 or @xmath29 , or include diagrams symmetric to given diagrams .",
    "in each pair of diagrams , the left one is taken from @xmath21 , and the right one is from @xmath296 , and it is a matter of definitions to see that @xmath311 .    to be explicit , consider the restricted diagram marked as below : @xmath312    assume that the length of the @xmath252 marked diagonal in the first diagram is @xmath180 ; then @xmath313 , while @xmath314 , showing the two are equal . as the skew diagram for the pair @xmath315 contains exactly as many boxes as the diagram for @xmath16 , @xmath316 , showing @xmath305 in this case .",
    "all other cases are similar ; the relevant diagrams appear below :    @xmath317    @xmath318    by the discussion above , this shows that if @xmath16 in @xmath58 , and @xmath292 , then @xmath305 for @xmath319 .",
    "the cases @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be verified using the computer .",
    "as noted above , this proof will proceed by noting the possible restricted diagrams that may appear with an @xmath238-labeled outside corner of @xmath20 , and an @xmath238 labeled inside corner of @xmath18 . in each case",
    ", we provide the diagrams associated to @xmath16 , @xmath321 , and @xmath315 , respectively , and reference the part of lemma [ q ] ( below ) that is used in showing that @xmath322 .",
    "let @xmath323 denote the diagram of @xmath79 in @xmath58 , and @xmath324 the number of boxes in the restriction to @xmath302 of @xmath325 . then @xmath326 .",
    "note that @xmath327 , where @xmath328 is @xmath329 .",
    "in particular , if we wish to show that @xmath330 , we can instead show @xmath331 , where @xmath332 , and similarly for @xmath89 . then multiplication by @xmath333 , where @xmath328 is as above , generates the desired identity .",
    "calculating @xmath328 introduces extra notation , and can be avoided in the proof that follows .",
    "instead , we will multiply the terms coming from the diagrams for @xmath321 and @xmath315 by the power of @xmath291 to bring those terms to degree @xmath334 , resp .",
    "@xmath335 .",
    "we require a lemma to make the proof .",
    "[ q ] for and @xmath336 ,    1 .",
    "@xmath337 2 .",
    "@xmath338    the result follows from the definition of quantum integers .",
    "to finish the proof of the main theorem , consider first the restricted diagram @xmath339 with outside corners north of and west of the inside @xmath238-labeled corner , occurs in the type @xmath99 quotients , as well as @xmath340 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , with @xmath180 @xmath251 marked boxes .",
    "this diagram yields @xmath341 which is of degree @xmath342 .",
    "then @xmath343 , which has degree @xmath344 , differs from expectations by @xmath345 , and @xmath346 with degree @xmath347 , differs from the expected degree by @xmath151 .",
    "thus the relevant identity to show is @xmath348 which is lemma [ q ] ( 1 ) .    from here",
    ", we describe on , we cease to explicitly calculate the expected degrees . in all cases , @xmath180 is the number of @xmath251 signs in the first diagram of a triple .    for our next diagram ,",
    "take @xmath349 corresponds to the identity @xmath350 which reduces to lemma [ q ] , ( 1 ) .",
    "this appears in the type @xmath99 quotients , as well as @xmath340 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "next consider @xmath351 corresponds to the identity @xmath352 which reduces to lemma [ q ] , ( 1 ) .",
    "this appears in the type @xmath99 quotients , as well as @xmath340 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "we now move to restricted diagrams that appear in @xmath163 and @xmath126 .",
    "consider the restricted diagram of @xmath21 @xmath353 where @xmath241 is @xmath190 , and @xmath89 is @xmath354 , or vice versa .",
    "then we obtain the following triple of marked diagrams @xmath355 ( note the first box in the bottom row of the last diagram can not be marked , by reason of parity ) .",
    "suppose there are @xmath180 @xmath251 marked boxes in the first diagram .",
    "then this restricted diagram corresponds to the identity @xmath356 which reduces to lemma [ q ] , ( 1 ) .",
    "the restricted diagram of @xmath21 @xmath357 with @xmath358 , @xmath359 with an odd number of copies of @xmath190 appears as a restricted interval in @xmath360 , and by our labeling algorithm , bears the same marks as the above case , and so satisfies the same identity .    the same restricted diagram , but with an even number of @xmath190 labeled boxes , appears in @xmath360 but not @xmath182 ( as we assume in that the label in the lowest box @xmath89 is a descent of @xmath20 , which in @xmath164 requires @xmath89 to be an odd box ) . here the identity is @xmath361 which is true by inspection .",
    "consider the diagram @xmath21 corresponding to @xmath16 @xmath362 with marked triple @xmath363 and note if two boxes are @xmath251 marked , their weights are @xmath151 and @xmath180 , where the @xmath251 marked box is labeled @xmath364 . from this , we can read @xmath365 , while @xmath282 for the second diagram is @xmath366 , and the third is @xmath367 .",
    "substituting into the recursion , we can reduce to the identity in lemma [ q ] , ( 2 ) .",
    "this diagram appears in @xmath182 , and can be renumbered @xmath368 to be found in @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    in @xmath142 ,",
    "the only relevant diagrams have the following shape @xmath369 with marked triple @xmath370 we show the full diagram , but this is only to aid comprehension .",
    "the usual three diagonals are all that is important to the calculation .",
    "the relevant identity is @xmath371 which is trivially verified .",
    "as an aside , it is straightforward to use the above identity , and induction , to show the following",
    ".    [ bnclosed ] if @xmath0 $ ] is an interval in @xmath142 , then @xmath372 .",
    "this type of interval appears in @xmath142 , @xmath360 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "the remaining cases are similar , and we give only the diagrams which have yet to appear :    in @xmath360 and @xmath182 we have @xmath373 where @xmath374 is @xmath252 if there are an even number of @xmath251 signs in the first diagram , and is unmarked otherwise , and @xmath375 is @xmath251 if there are an odd number of @xmath251 signs in the first diagram , and unmarked otherwise .",
    "similarly , in @xmath360 and @xmath182 , we have the restricted diagrams @xmath376 with @xmath374 and @xmath375 as above .    finally , there are finitely many cases arising in @xmath28 and @xmath29 that may be obtained by hand or computer program .",
    "as an application of the above algorithm , we show that the intersection cohomology of the cominiscule flag varieties is a combinatorial invariant , i.e. the cohomology is a function only of the poset .",
    "begin by recalling proposition [ ordertheorem ] , which provides a characterization of all covering relations in the weyl quotient posets of hermitian symmetric type .",
    "in particular , the poset @xmath58 is isomorphic to the containment order on partitions of the given types .",
    "all that remains is to show is that a skew diagram uniquely determines an @xmath377 polynomial .      the leftmost box in @xmath98 is easily observed to be an ascent of @xmath18 within @xmath20 for any diagram of hermitian type .",
    "no other box is an ascent , or descent , of @xmath18 , thus the polynomial is as stated .",
    "the proof for columns is almost the same .",
    "recall that we say that a diagram without its labels is a partition . in particular , note that a diagram @xmath19 is associated with a class of partitions , notably all such partitions that can contain that shape with that filling .",
    "meanwhile the partition @xmath91 associated @xmath19 is associated with that class , and any other diagram @xmath17 that , when stripped of its filling , has shape @xmath91 .",
    "we will use upper case greek letters for diagrams , and lower case greek letters for partitions in this section .",
    "recall in particular the definitions of section [ sdiagrams ] .",
    "if @xmath21 is a standard skew diagram of type @xmath58 , it can be identified with a skew diagram in type @xmath379 , and the @xmath3-polynomial associated to @xmath21 in @xmath58 is the same as the @xmath3-polynomial of the same shape in type @xmath379 .",
    "it is easy to see in the diagrams of section [ hsdiag ] that a standard tableau of any type other than @xmath126 is supported on a set of simple roots whose coxeter graph is an induced subgraph of a coxeter graph of type @xmath379 .    for the @xmath126 case , the standard skew diagram for @xmath98 can include a single box labeled @xmath190 in the bottom left corner ( see figure below ) .",
    "if this corner is not an inside corner , then the box north and west of it ( in the diagram for @xmath18 ) is an outside corner , and by the rules established for @xmath126 , the box associated to @xmath190 is unmarked , as it would be in type @xmath379 . if it is an inside corner , it is marked with a plus , exactly as it would be in type @xmath379 .",
    "all other boxes in the diagram are marked according to type @xmath379 rules , and thus the polynomial associated to @xmath21 in the context of the quotient @xmath126 is the same as the polynomial associated with the same diagram in type @xmath379 .",
    "we call a partition a _ staircase _ if it can be identified with the partition underlying a hermitian diagram of type @xmath163 . note that the full list of maximal staircase partitions not explicitly belonging to @xmath163 or @xmath126 are @xmath382 but in all cases , the rules are those of @xmath163 , and so we can identify polynomials again as before .",
    "the final general form of skew partition is an l shape , of which there are two exceptional maximal examples , and one infinite class : @xmath383 in type @xmath142 , the have @xmath384 via proposition [ bnclosed ] , while the rule in type @xmath385 is clear : one plus in the upper left box , and no other signs .",
    "thus the relative @xmath3-polynomials are the same ."
