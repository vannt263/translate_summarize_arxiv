    "its emergence from asynchronous / incoherent phase is the celebrated kuramoto model , involving phase - only oscillators of distributed natural frequencies coupled via a mean field @xcite .",
    "the model enjoys the status of one of the most studied nonlinear dynamical systems , which continues to provoke many unresolved issues @xcite .    in the kuramoto model ,",
    "the oscillator phases follow a first - order evolution in time . a generalized second - order",
    "stochastic dynamics , initially studied to model better synchronization among flashing fireflies , accounts for the finite moments of inertia of the oscillators ( thus , the oscillators become instead the rotators ) , and for the stochastic fluctuations of the natural frequencies in time @xcite .",
    "the generalized dynamics without stochasticity also arises in electrical power distribution networks @xcite .    in a different context",
    ", one may interpret the generalized kuramoto dynamics as that of a system of interacting particles driven by quenched disordered external torques , and evolving in presence of an external heat bath and dissipation ; the kuramoto model is recovered as the overdamped , noiseless dynamics .",
    "this interpretation offers the very promising possibility of studying the dynamics from statistical mechanical perspectives by using tools of kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "the generalized model is a rich laboratory to study many - body nonequilibrium dynamics in presence of external drive and quenched disorder .",
    "the system relaxes at long times to a nonequilibrium stationary state ( ness ) @xcite ; the synchronized state ( respectively , the incoherent state ) corresponds to a spatially inhomogeneous ( respectively , spatially homogeneous ) ness .    unlike in equilibrium ,",
    "a ness is characterized by a violation of detailed balance , and an associated phase space distribution that can not be expressed in the gibbs - boltzmann form @xmath0 in terms of a hamiltonian @xmath1 and an inverse temperature @xmath2 .",
    "instead , the ness distribution has to be obtained by studying on a case - by - case basis the underlying dynamical model .",
    "this task proves daunting especially for many - body interacting systems ; exact results are known only for simple models , often via _ tour de force _ @xcite , while for more complex models , simulations and approximation methods are invoked @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a novel method to obtain the inhomogeneous ness single - rotator phase space distribution for the generalized kuramoto model in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the resulting distribution has a nontrivial form with respect to the gibbs - boltzmann distribution in equilibrium .",
    "our result provides an example of a computation of a nontrivial probability distribution associated to a ness in presence of quenched disorder .",
    "significantly , our proposed method applies not just to the case at hand , but , in fact , to _ any _ periodic two - body mean - field interaction potential , thereby providing a general framework to compute ness distribution in a wide class of systems .",
    "our method involves a series expansion of the stationary distribution in terms of the inverse of the damping coefficient , as opposed to an expansion in the same parameter of the kramers operator for the time evolution of the single - rotator distribution @xcite . in our method ,",
    "the expansion coefficients satisfy recursion relations whose solution requires evaluation of a matrix where about three quarters of the elements vanish , making the numerical implementation very efficient computationally and also simple compared to the operator - expansion method .",
    "also , in contrast to application of the latter method to systems in external fields @xcite , we develop our method for mean - field systems that require self - consistent evaluation of the mean fields .",
    "note that the series expansion of the distribution is asymptotic in nature ( just as the expansion of the kramers operator @xcite ) , and one can resort to the borel summation method to sum the series properly @xcite . in the context of the generalized kuramoto dynamics , we demonstrate an excellent agreement of our theory with simulation results for the phase space distribution .",
    "the latter is characterized by a spatially non - uniform temperature profile distinctive of nesss and absent in equilibrium .",
    "we remark that in a recent work @xcite we studied the generalized kuramoto dynamics , with a focus on obtaining the complete phase diagram of the model for a general unimodal frequency distribution of the oscillators . based on simulations and some analytic bounds",
    ", we demonstrated that the model shows a nonequilibrium first - order phase transition from a synchronized phase at low values of the relevant parameters to an incoherent phase at high values .",
    "however , our analytical approach allowed to obtain only the homogeneous ness single - rotator phase space distribution and to study its dynamical stability , while we could not compute analytically the distribution of the inhomogeneous ness , namely , the synchronized state . in the present work",
    "we do not address the issue of phase transitions , but we focus on a method that computes the inhomogeneous ness , not just for the kuramoto potential , but for any other periodic mean - field interaction potential .",
    "thus , we also fill the gap left in our previous work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section , we state the setting of the class of mean - field models that forms the object of our study , and",
    "write the dynamical equations in a convenient dimensionless form . in section [ seckramers ]",
    ", we discuss the kramers equation for the time evolution of the single - rotator phase space distribution , and in particular , present in detail our method to compute its stationary solution for the inhomogeneous phase .",

    "<S> we present a novel method to compute the phase space distribution in the nonequilibrium stationary state of a wide class of mean - field systems involving rotators subject to quenched disordered external drive and dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> the method involves a series expansion of the stationary distribution in inverse of the damping coefficient ; the expansion coefficients satisfy recursion relations whose solution requires computing a matrix where about three quarters of the elements vanish , making numerical evaluation simple and efficient . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate our method for the paradigmatic kuramoto model of spontaneous collective synchronization and for its two mode generalization , in presence of noise and inertia , and demonstrate an excellent agreement between simulations and theory for the phase space distribution .    </S>"
