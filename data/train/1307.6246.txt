    "the relevance of bilevel optimization problems has been amply recognized by researchers and practitioners alike @xcite .",
    "the key difference between bilevel programming problems and other optimization problems is their nested structure .",
    "a bilevel program is commonly defined as an optimization problem , which contains another optimization task within the constraints of the outer problem .",
    "the outer optimization problem is generally termed as the upper level problem , and the constraining optimization task is denominated as the lower level problem .",
    "such a nested structure means that a solution to the upper level problem is considered feasible only if it is an optimal solution to the lower level problem . because of this requirement , bilevel optimization problems can quickly become very difficult to solve .",
    "bilevel optimization problems often appear as leader - follower problems in the fields of game theory and economics .",
    "when formulating a leader - follower scenario as a bilevel programming problem , the leader s optimization task is modeled at the upper level , constrained by the follower s optimization task at the lower level .",
    "the leader has the ability to move first , and is assumed to possess all necessary information about the follower s possible reactions to the actions taken by the leader .",
    "the follower , on the other hand , observes the leader s actions before reacting optimally to them . by solving a stackelberg competition model , the leader can forecast the follower s reactions and determine his own optimal actions .    in this paper , we model a particular kind of oligopolistic market involving multiple leaders and followers interacting over multiple time periods .",
    "such a scenario can be analysed as a special case of a multi - period multi - leader - follower stackelberg game .",
    "this problem builds on the original definition of duopolistic competition proposed by @xcite and its various extensions @xcite . the multi - period market model presented in this paper",
    "allows us to incorporate relevant dynamics and several practical aspects , such as investment and marketing effects , in a flexible manner . as an extension to the prior work",
    ", we also assume the production of all players in this market to be discrete variables while allowing the investment and marketing decisions to be continuous .",
    "this feature makes the model framework applicable to markets where the products are valuable and are not well approximated by continuous variables , such as in the aircraft manufacturing market .",
    "further realism is added to the problem in the form of non - linear demand and cost functions , and constraints on investment and marketing budget for both the leaders and the followers .",
    "the effects of investment and marketing are considered to be cumulative leading to interactions between the time - periods .",
    "evolutionary algorithms have been used in the past in the domain of game theory with players making simultaneous moves ( nash equilibria ) , players making asynchronous moves , or a mix of the two situations .",
    "for instance , lung et al .",
    "@xcite consider a multi - player game and propose a domination concept to detect the nash - equilibria using an evolutionary multi - objective algorithm .",
    "koh @xcite proposes an evolutionary algorithm for handling a similar model with multiple leaders and followers as considered in this paper .",
    "however , koh assumes that it is possible to write the first - order conditions for the lower level problem , which is not possible in the problem considered in this paper .",
    "classical techniques like branch - and - bound have also been applied to handle bilevel problems involving multiple players .",
    "@xcite use a branch - and - bound technique to handle linear stackelberg problems with a single leader and multiple followers .",
    "zhang et al .",
    "@xcite study a similar problem with a single leader and multiple followers , but in this study the functions involve fuzzy coefficients and multiple objectives at both levels .",
    "many studies have been conducted in the field of bilevel programming @xcite and on its practical applications for solving various problems @xcite .",
    "aspects of bilevel programming have also been reviewed in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the problems encountered in the literature are commonly solved with the help of approximate solution methodologies @xcite .",
    "these techniques work with numerous simplifying assumptions , and most of them are inapplicable to problems with higher levels of complexity .",
    "the classical methods widely employed by researchers and practitioners to solve these problems include the karush - kuhn - tucker approach @xcite , branch - and - bound techniques @xcite and the use of penalty functions @xcite .",
    "however , the recent technological advances and increased computing power have made heuristic approaches , such as evolutionary algorithms , more popular for solving complex optimization problems .",
    "evolutionary algorithms have also been applied to bilevel programming problems @xcite .",
    "given the encouraging results obtained with such techniques , we have also opted to employ a nested evolutionary algorithm to solve the multi - leader - flower problem .",
    "the choice is well motivated by the complexities due to non - linearity and discreteness that are inherent in our model for oligopolistic markets .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec : model ] presents a general formulation of a multi - period multi - leader - follower stackelberg competition model .",
    "section [ sec : multiplayer ] outlines a more concrete model with a discussion about its possible application to the aircraft manufacturing market .",
    "section [ sec : method ] contains a description of the procedure followed by the nested bilevel evolutionary algorithm to arrive at the optimal solution , and then in section [ sec : evaluation ] we evaluate the proposed nested bilevel evolutionary algorithm . section [ sec : results ] presents the results on the multi - period multi - leader - follower stackelberg optimization problem .",
    "section [ sec : convergence ] provides a convergence analysis on a simplistic version of the stackelberg competition model .",
    "lastly , the conclusions and plans for future work are summarized in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "three main models  the bertrand , cournot , and stackelberg competition models  are extensively applied in economics when modeling multi - firm competition @xcite .",
    "the first two models are generally used when the competing firms have an approximately equal amount of market power , and make production and pricing decisions simultaneously . however , in an oligopoly , where some of the competing firms have more market power than others , a stackelberg model is considered more suitable .",
    "such markets are much more common in practice than strict oligopolies and deserve more attention @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we outline some of the notations used throughout the rest of this paper and present a generalized formulation of a stackelberg competition model with multiple leaders and followers .    in the context of the multi - leader - follower problem framework ,",
    "a strategy is defined as a sequence of decisions made by a player throughout the duration of the game . a strategy for a leader @xmath0",
    "can be stated as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a particular decision made by the leader at time @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the set of all alternative strategies available to leader @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , we denote a strategy for a follower @xmath5 as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a particular decision of follower @xmath5 at time @xmath3 , and @xmath8 is the set of alternative strategies .",
    "a combination of strategies adopted by @xmath9 leaders for the entire duration of the game can be presented as @xmath10 , and for @xmath11 followers as @xmath12 , where the decision spaces @xmath13 are defined as @xmath14 by optimizing the objectives of the competing firms in these stackelberg games , we obtain the optimal strategies for the leaders and followers as the solution .",
    "a general multi - leader - follower stackelberg competition model with @xmath9 leaders and @xmath11 followers may be formulated as @xmath15 where @xmath16 denote the objective functions for leader @xmath0 and follower @xmath5 respectively .",
    "similarly , the constraints for the leaders and followers are given by mappings @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the number of constraints for the leaders and followers is @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "each of the @xmath9 leaders acts as a traditional stackelberg leader towards the follower firms , but as a cournot firm with respect to the other @xmath21 leaders .",
    "the @xmath9 leaders choose their strategies simultaneously and non - cooperatively among themselves , as in a classic cournot competition model , but collectively they are in a stackelberg competition with the follower firms .",
    "similarly , the @xmath11 followers act as stackelberg followers towards the leaders and as cournot firms with respect to each other .",
    "thus , the model consists of two cournot competitions encompassed by a stackelberg competition model .",
    "the generality of the formulation allows us to easily extend the problem to include as many leaders and followers as necessary , and to make them as different from one another as needed to model a real - world market situation .",
    "however , in this paper we assume that the @xmath9 leaders and @xmath11 followers are symmetric among themselves .    in the next section",
    ", we present a more concrete example of this general model .",
    "additional complexity is introduced into this extended model by incorporating investment and marketing variables into each decision , expenditure constraints , and discrete production variables into the model for both the leaders and the followers .",
    "a classic stackelberg game involves a single leader and a single follower , and the game is played for just one period .",
    "such strict duopolies are very difficult , if not impossible , to find in practice .",
    "oligopolies , i.e. markets with a small number of competing firms , are more common .",
    "when the markets have more than one distinct leader and follower , the situation corresponds to a multi - leader - follower stackelberg game . in such settings ,",
    "the firms with the first movers advantage become the stackelberg leaders , and the others act as followers . as already mentioned , in the model considered in this paper",
    ", we assume that the group of firms which act as leaders or followers compete in a cournot fashion within their respective groups .",
    "an example of such a market is the aircraft manufacturing industry . due to the high market entry costs ,",
    "the player base is relatively small and stable .",
    "the market is dominated by a couple of large players , namely boeing and airbus , who satisfy most of the commercial demand for airplanes , and can be safely regarded as the market leaders .",
    "contracts that are small for these market giants are filled by the smaller players , who do not experience the same economies of scale as the leaders and rightfully assume the positions of the followers in this market . due to the high costs of the products , each firm in the market tries to optimize its decisions to reduce costs and streamline its processes .",
    "furthermore , the players production quantities are discrete and comparatively small , meaning that the production of one additional unit may lead to significant shifts in profits . while we do not specifically try to model this particular market , the framework presented in this section could be applied to it without much alteration .",
    "there are several aspects that differentiate the model discussed in this section from a traditional stackelberg game .",
    "the main differences are the presence of multiple leaders and followers , the addition of multiple time periods and the interrelation between those periods caused by investment and marketing expenditures made in each period .",
    "additional realism is introduced into the model by requiring the production amounts to be discrete for both the leaders and the followers .",
    "this allows us to replicate the behaviour of those markets where unit cost of production is high .",
    "it is also worth noting that a player s ability to invest is not equivalent to their ability to borrow or lend extra funds , which implies that the players have to finance their investment and marketing projects from their own revenues . as a further modification ,",
    "we relax the strict product homogeneity assumption inherent in the original stackelberg competition model . by assuming that the products are not perfectly homogeneous but still substitutable",
    ", we can allow each firm to influence the price of its own goods to a certain degree by means of marketing .    in the following ,",
    "we define the variables used in this model for leader @xmath0 and follower @xmath5 respectively :    * @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the demands for products * @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the prices for products * @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the profits * @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the production costs * @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the investment amounts * @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the marketing expenditures * @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the production levels    a superscript @xmath3 , when added to any of these variables , denotes the value for the variable at time period @xmath3 . a leader s decision in any time period @xmath3",
    "is made up of choosing the production level , investment amount , and marketing expenditure for that period and can be written as @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , a follower s decision in the same time period is made up of his own production level , investment and marketing expenditure and can be written as @xmath37 .",
    "the production variables of both players are assumed to be discrete , while their investment and marketing expenditures are expressed in monetary terms and are hence continuous .",
    "therefore , the decision spaces of the leaders and followers for any time period @xmath3 are given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively , where @xmath40 . using the above - defined notation ,",
    "the multi - period multi - leader - follower stackelberg competition model can be expressed as follows :    @xmath41    in the above formulation , it is assumed that all the leaders and followers are capable of satisfying the entire market s demand for their products , and this assumption is reflected by constraint and the corresponding constraint for the followers .",
    "the restrictions on the size of investment and marketing expenditures are given by constraints ( [ eq : linvestment ] , [ eq : lmarketing ] ) and the respective constraints for the followers .",
    "we also require that @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which implies that investment and marketing expenditures must not exceed revenue in the previous period .",
    "constraint and the follower s respective constraint show that both investment and marketing are null for both firms in the first period because there is no revenue yet to fund these expenditures .",
    "the sum of profits of the leaders and followers may be further decomposed as @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the profits generated by leader @xmath0 and follower @xmath5 during period @xmath3 .",
    "the single period profits are calculated by deducting production , investment , and marketing expenses from total revenue , i.e. @xmath48",
    "we solve the above problem using a computationally intensive nested scheme relying on the principles of evolutionary computation .",
    "the method is based on a steady state single - objective real - coded genetic algorithm to solve the problems at both levels .",
    "the underlying algorithm at both levels is a modified version of the procedures @xcite based on the single objective parent centric crossover ( pcx ) @xcite .",
    "the nested bilevel evolutionary algorithm used to solve the described multi - period multi - leader - follower problem is a simple - minded strategy , where the lower level problem is solved for all given upper level decision vectors .",
    "whenever the lower level optimal decision vector is to be determined for an upper level decision vector , the information is utilized from the nearest upper level decision vector for which the lower level optimal decision vector is known .",
    "a step - by - step procedure for the algorithm is described as follows :    0.2 cm _ step 1 : initialization .",
    "_ a random population of size @xmath49 is initialized by generating the required number of upper level variables , and then the lower level optimization procedure is executed to determine the corresponding optimal lower level variables .",
    "fitness is assigned based on upper level function value and constraints .",
    "_ step 2 : selection of upper level parents .",
    "_ randomly choose @xmath50 members from the previously obtained population and conduct a tournament selection to determine @xmath51 sets of parents .",
    "_ step 3 : evolution at the upper level . _",
    "create @xmath52 offsprings by performing a pcx based crossover @xcite ( refer sub - section [ sec : crossover ] ) and a polynomial mutation for the real variables , and a binary crossover and a binary mutation for the discrete variables .",
    "_ step 4 : lower level optimization .",
    "_ for each of the generated offsprings , determine the closest upper level member in the population .",
    "copy the lower level optimal variables from the closest upper level member .",
    "thereafter , generate a lower level random population with a population size @xmath53 . include the lower level variables from the closest upper level member in the lower level population as the @xmath54 member .",
    "perform the lower level optimization run with the generated population members .",
    "_ step 5 : evaluate offsprings .",
    "_ combine the upper level variables for the offsprings from step 3 with the corresponding optimal lower level variables from step 4 , and evaluate each of the offsprings .",
    "_ step 6 : population update . _ after evaluating the offsprings , choose @xmath55 random members from the parent population and pool them with the @xmath52 offsprings .",
    "the best @xmath55 members from the pool replace the chosen @xmath55 members from the population .    _ step 7 : termination check . _",
    "perform a termination check and proceed to the next generation ( step 2 ) if the termination check ( refer sub - section [ sec : termination ] ) is false .",
    "the lower level optimization procedure is similar to the upper level procedure .",
    "the fitness assignment at this level is performed based on lower level function value and constraints .",
    "after initializing @xmath56 lower level members , @xmath50 members are randomly chosen from the population .",
    "a tournament selection is performed and @xmath51 parents are chosen for crossover .",
    "crossover and mutation operators are used to to generate @xmath52 offsprings . a population update is performed as before by choosing @xmath55 random members from the population . a pool is formed using @xmath55 chosen members and @xmath52 offsprings , from which the best @xmath55 members are used to replace the @xmath55 chosen members from the population .",
    "the next generation is executed if the termination criteria is not satisfied .",
    "the parameters in the algorithm are fixed as @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "crossover probability is fixed at @xmath60 and the mutation probability is @xmath61 .",
    "the upper level population size @xmath49 and the lower level population size @xmath56 are fixed as 100 .",
    "the crossover operator used in step 3 is similar to the pcx operator proposed in @xcite .",
    "the operator creates a new solution from 3 parents as follows , choosing one of the parents as the index parent : @xmath62 the terms used in the above equation are defined as follows :    * @xmath63 is the _ index _ parent * @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the mean of @xmath51 parents * @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the other two parents * @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the two parameters , where @xmath70 is the number of real variables in the problem    the two parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 , describe the extent of variations along the respective directions . while creating @xmath58 offsprings from @xmath57 parents , each parent is chosen as an index parent at a time .",
    "the constraint handling scheme proposed by @xcite is used in this paper . at both levels , a constraint violation is defined as the sum of violations of all constraints for any point . a member of the population with a smaller constraint violation is always preferred by the algorithm over a member with a higher constraint violation .",
    "a member with no constraint violation is deemed to be a feasible , and is considered better than any of the other infeasible members . when making a comparison between two feasible members , the member with the higher function value is preferred .",
    "the algorithm uses a variance - based termination criteria at both levels .",
    "when the value of @xmath73 , described in the following equation becomes less than @xmath74 , the algorithm terminates .",
    "@xmath75 the value of @xmath73 is restricted between 0 and 1 in ( [ eq : criteria ] ) . in the above equation , @xmath76 corresponds to the number of dimensions in the considered optimization problem .",
    "thus , this value is equal to the number of lower level variables for the lower level problem and to the number of upper level variables for the upper level problem .",
    "the variables in the current population are denoted by @xmath77 , and the variables of the initial population are given by @xmath78 . for both levels",
    ", the value of @xmath74 is set as @xmath79 .",
    "for all the runs performed in this paper , we execute a mutation - based local - search at both the levels after the termination of the algorithm to check if the algorithm has properly converged .",
    "in the later part of this paper , we evaluate the described nested bilevel evolutionary algorithm on a set of bilevel test problems , and then solve the multi - period multi - leader - follower problem .",
    "the algorithm described above is evaluated on a set of recently proposed smd @xcite test problems to determine its efficacy towards handling difficult bilevel problems .",
    "the test set considered in this paper contains 6 test problems , which evaluate the solution procedure accross various difficulties offered by commonly encountered bilevel optimization problems .",
    "we provide the results of the algorithm on 10 and 20 variable instances of the smd test problems",
    ". for 10-variable instances of the smd problems , table [ tab : smdtable1 ] shows the number of function evaluations required at the upper and lower levels , and table [ tab : smdtable2 ] provides the accuracy achieved along with the average number of lower level function evaluations required per lower level call .",
    "similar results are reported for the 20-variable instances in tables [ tab : smdtable3 ] and [ tab : smdtable4 ] .",
    "all performance metrics have been computed based on 31 runs of the evolutionary procedure .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : simple ]",
    "in this paper , we have presented a formulation of a multi - period , multi - leader - follower stackelberg competition model with @xmath9 leaders , @xmath11 followers , and @xmath80 time periods .",
    "the formulation can be applied to oligopolistic markets , and one possible application has been briefly discussed .",
    "a nested bilevel evolutionary algorithm was used to solve the problem .",
    "the ability of the algorithm towards solving difficult bilevel problems has been tested on a recently proposed test - suite of smd test problems .",
    "we have solved a concrete version of the multi - period , multi - leader - follower stackelberg competition model that included @xmath81 leaders , @xmath82 followers , and @xmath82 time periods by employing the nested bilevel evolutionary framework .",
    "the approach is computationally intensive , but is easily parallelizable .",
    "it allows us to solve the problem despite the difficulties presented by certain assumptions of the model that conventional bilevel methodologies would not be able to overcome .",
    "an analysis of the model has also been performed by varying the number of leaders and followers in the system .",
    "our future efforts would be directed at improving the overall efficiency of the solution methodology so that it can handle more complex problems with a higher number of variables .",
    "additional intelligence needs to be incorporated into the algorithm so that it converges to the optimal solution more quickly .",
    "there is also room to improve the problem formulation to reflect the real - world market situations more accurately .",
    "a multi - objective extension of the problem would be of further interest .",
