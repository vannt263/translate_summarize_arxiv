    "dwarf novae ( dne ) are non - magnetic cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) with accretion discs and with a white dwarf primary and a main sequence secondary star .",
    "they are relatively nearby sources which provide a laboratory for studying accretion disc physics in our galaxy .",
    "the orbital periods of dne are typically between 70 min and 10 h. from time to time , the disc goes into an outburst which is a brightening of the disc by 29 magnitudes and which can last from days to several weeks .",
    "the mechanism leading to a dwarf nova outburst is thought to be a disc instability which was first proposed by @xcite ( for a more detailed discussion see @xcite ) . after this luminous phenomenon",
    ", the system returns to quiescence which can last from @xmath0 10 days to decades .",
    "the disc dominates the optical emission during an outburst .",
    "su uma type dwarf novae show superoutbursts which can last for several weeks and are characterized by superhumps , periodic brightenings whose recurrence times are slightly longer than the orbital period .",
    "superhumps are thought to be due to a 3:1 resonance in the accretion disc @xcite .",
    "while most su uma types show normal outbursts and superoutbursts , a subset called the wz sge stars only have superoutbursts .",
    "a typical feature of superoutbursts is a plateau phase in the optical lightcurve lasting for several days .",
    "gw lib was discovered in 1983 when it went into an outburst @xcite .",
    "it was present in eso b survey plates at magnitude 18.5 preceding the 1983 outburst .",
    "gw lib brightened by 9 magnitudes during the outburst and later faded back to the quiescent state and thus was classified as a nova .",
    "later studies showed that the spectrum resembled a dwarf nova in quiescence @xcite . since 1983 , no other outbursts of gw lib had been observed until that of april 12 , 2007 @xcite .",
    "this outburst , which was recorded by the _ aavso _",
    "observers , _ wasp - south _ and by _ swift _ , lasted for 26 days .",
    "the brightest optical magnitude was reached at @xmath0 8 mag in the _ v _ band .",
    "gw lib has been classified as a wz sge type star due to its short period ( @xmath1 = 76.78 min , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and low accretion rate @xcite .",
    "typical characteristics of wz sge type stars are short orbital periods , low mass - transfer rates and extremely long recurrence times which can last for decades .",
    "gw lib was the first observed cv in which the accreting white dwarf showed non - radial pulsations @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was not expected to be discovered in accreting binaries since they were considered to be too hot to be located in the dav instability strip , although low mass transfer rates from the secondary would explain low net accretion rates onto the white dwarf , and thus a lower accretion heating of the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the pulsations of white dwarfs are thought to be due to g - mode non - radial gravity waves @xcite . in gw lib",
    ", pulsations are seen near 230 , 370 and 650 s in the optical waveband ( e.g. _ saao _ data ) , and also in the _ hst _ uv data but with @xmath0 6 times higher amplitudes than in the optical @xcite",
    ". an _ xmm - newton _ observation of gw lib obtained in 2005 during its quiescent state reveals that these pulsations are also present in the _ xmm - newton _ optical monitor ( om ) data , but not seen in the x - ray data @xcite .",
    "these _ xmm - newton _ observations also confirmed that gw  lib has a very low accretion rate during quiescence .    in this paper , we present the 2007 outburst lightcurves of gw lib in the optical ( _ aavso _ and _ wasp - south _ ) , uv ( _ swift _ , uvot ) and x - ray ( _ swift _ , xrt ) bands",
    ". we also present x - ray spectral analysis of the outburst observations and follow - up _ swift _ observations of gw lib in 2008 and 2009 .",
    "previous multiwavelength observations covering outbursts of su uma ( and wz sge ) type systems have been obtained from e.g. vw hyi @xcite , wz sge @xcite , and oy car , which was observed by the _ euve _ @xcite .",
    "multiwavelength observations of dwarf novae are needed in order to enhance our knowledge of astrophysical systems with discs , e.g. , x - ray binaries and agns .",
    "dn outbursts offer a good opportunity to study the disc physics , and compare the current theory of outbursts with the observational information .",
    "the fact that gw lib does not show any normal outbursts and the recurrence time between the two major outbursts was over 20 years , suggests that the disc structure could be different from most other dwarf novae .",
    "gw lib was initially observed by the _ swift gamma - ray burst explorer _",
    "@xcite between april 13th and may 16th , 2007 , over an interval of 30 days .",
    "the data were obtained with the ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ) @xcite and with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) @xcite which has an energy resolution of 140 ev at 5.9 kev ( at launch ) ( see @xcite , r @xmath0 40 ) .",
    "the xrt was operating in the window timing ( wt ) and photon - counting ( pc ) modes during the observations .",
    "the uvot observations were obtained in the imaging mode with the uv grism in order to provide spectral information and to mitigate against coincidence losses .",
    "the resolution of the uv grism is r @xmath0 150 for 1115 magnitude range stars the details of the 38 observations are listed in table  [ observations ] .",
    "the first two observations were obtained in imaging mode with the uvm2 filter , but these suffer from severe coincidence loss effects and were thus excluded from our analysis .",
    "the optical data were provided by the _ aavso _ observers and by the _ wide angle search for planets _ ( wasp ) @xcite .",

    "in most cases , the hard x - ray emission of dwarf novae is suppressed during an outburst .",
    "this is the case for vw  hyi @xcite , ss  cyg @xcite , z  cam @xcite , yz cnc @xcite and wz  sge @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the outburst x - ray emission of gw  lib peaks at 23 orders of magnitude higher than its quiescent level obtained by _ xmm - newton _ in 2005 @xcite .",
    "u  gem is the only other dwarf nova seen to increase its x - ray luminosity during an outburst @xcite , and in this case the outburst emission is only about a factor of five above its quiescent level @xcite .",
    "the absolute luminosity of the peak x - ray emission of gw  lib is high , but not extraordinary ( table  [ luminosity ] ) .",
    "it is about a factor of two less than the x - ray luminosity of ss  cyg at optical maximum ( which corresponds to the second , weaker peak in the x - ray light curve of ss cyg ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is only a factor of two more luminous than ru  peg in outburst , and a factor of three brighter than su  uma in outburst @xcite .",
    "gw  lib seems to stand out due to its unusually low x - ray luminosity in quiescence , rather than an exceptional x - ray luminosity in outburst .",
    "it may be that the relatively high mass of the white dwarf @xcite accounts for the high outburst x - ray luminosity , as it may do also in ss  cyg .",
    "very few systems have good x - ray coverage during an outburst , so it is not clear whether the steep decline in the x - ray luminosity of gw  lib during the first ten days of outburst is typical of other systems .",
    "the x - ray flux of wz  sge itself does decline during the first half of the outburst @xcite , but only about a factor of three in ten days , compared with a factor of thirty in gw  lib also over ten days ( although note that the first x - ray observation of wz  sge occurred about 3 days after the optical maximum ) .",
    "ss  cyg also declined after the optical maximum , in this case by about a factor of six over seven days @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the x - ray flux of vw  hyi was approximately constant during the outburst @xcite .",
    "in most dwarf novae the dominant high - energy emission during an outburst is optically - thick emission from the boundary layer , which emerges in the extreme - ultraviolet @xcite .",
    "this seems also to be the case for gw  lib , with a supersoft component detected in the first _ swift _ observation , although the luminosity of this component is poorly constrained by our observations ( fig.[bolom ] ) .",
    "the supersoft component is detected only in our first observation , but it is likely to be present also in the later epochs and just too soft to be detected by the _ swift _ xrt . only a small spectral change would be needed to move this component out of our bandpass .",
    "indeed , the extreme - ultraviolet components of vw  hyi and wz  sge are not detected at all with the _ rosat _ pspc and the _ chandra _ acis x - ray detectors respectively @xcite , although they are detected in the _ exosat _ le and _ chandra _ letg bandpasses .    in the few cases where good coverage has been achieved , the extreme - ultraviolet emission rises only after the x - ray emission has been suppressed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is assumed that this supersoft component takes over as the main source of cooling as the boundary layer becomes optically - thick to its own emission . since the extreme - ultraviolet emission is present even in our first _ swift _ observation , it is possible that the observed peak in x - ray emission actually represents the suppressed level , and that an even stronger x - ray peak was missed , corresponding to the peak emission of the optically - thin boundary layer . in ss",
    "cyg this first x - ray peak is a factor of three brighter than the second , weaker peak corresponding to the optical maximum .    in our later _",
    "swift _ observations the x - rays decline , then flatten off , and at the end of the disc outburst there is a sharp dip followed by a bump in the x - ray light curve , which coincides with the rapid decline in the optical and ultraviolet lightcurves .",
    "the x - ray hardness also increases at this time .",
    "these features are shared to some extent with other systems . a dip and a bump",
    "are seen in u  gem @xcite which is the only other system where x - rays are known to be brighter in outburst than in quiescence .",
    "a bump is also seen in ss  cyg where it is thought to correspond to the boundary layer transitioning back to its optically - thin state @xcite .",
    "another feature similar to gw lib is the increase in hardness at the end of the outburst in ss  cyg , and indeed , dwarf novae are usually harder in quiescence than in outburst @xcite .",
    "when comparing the outburst x - ray emission to quiescence it is important to distinguish between pre- and post - outburst quiescence .",
    "gw  lib was unusually faint for a dwarf nova in quiescence in the _ xmm - newton _ observation made two years before the 2007 outburst @xcite .",
    "our _ swift _ xrt outburst observations continued for about six days after the end of the sharp decline in the optical and ultraviolet lightcurves , which presumably defines the end of the disc outburst .",
    "our measured x - ray luminosity after this decline ( s5 in table  [ luminosity ] ) is a factor of fifty higher than the pre - outburst quiescent level @xcite .",
    "our follow - up _ swift _ observations in 2008 and 2009 show that gw  lib declined by a factor of five after the outburst , but that it remained an order of magnitude brighter than the pre - outburst observations for at least twenty one months after the outburst .",
    "another important difference between the _ xmm - newton _ and _ swift _ observations is that @xcite found an oxygen abundance enhanced by at least a factor of six above the solar value , whereas we find that our first outburst spectrum is inconsistent with such a high value and that the iron abundance appears to be significantly sub - solar .",
    "it is difficult to understand how observed abundances can change so much between quiescence and outburst .",
    "it has been noted in other systems that the x - ray flux tends to decrease between outbursts .",
    "examples include vw hyi @xcite and ss cyg @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the usual predictions of the disc instability model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which the accretion rate gradually increases during quiescence as the disc refills .",
    "the inferred decrease in the quiescent x - ray flux in gw lib is by a much larger factor than in vw hyi and ss cyg , but the inter - outburst interval is also much larger in gw lib ( decades compared with weeks and months ) , so there is more time for this decrease to progress .",
    "the long inter - outburst intervals of gw  lib and other wz  sge type stars mean that the opportunities to study the outbursts of these objects in detail have been very scarce . in this respect ,",
    "our data represent a rare insight into these intriguing dwarf novae .    to date",
    ", the physical cause of the long inter - outburst times has remained elusive .",
    "it is not at all clear why the accretion discs in these stars should behave any differently from those in other dne with very similar system parameters . yet , while the majority of non - magnetic , short period dne exhibit outbursts every few weeks or months , the wz  sge stars outburst every few years or decades .",
    "there are two main sets of models which attempt to explain this stark difference in recurrence time . in order to suppress the onset of regular outbursts and",
    "hence lengthen the inter - outburst interval , either the quiescent viscosity must be much lower than in other systems @xcite or the inner disc must be somehow truncated @xcite . while the low viscosity models are appealing in that they neatly explain the long recurrence times , they remain unsatisfying in requiring the viscosity in some quiescent discs to be different from others while , at the same time , being very similar during outbursts . models which appeal to inner disc truncation , suppress regular outbursts by removing the inner region of the accretion disc where outbursts are most easily triggered .",
    "often disc truncation is explained by the propeller action of the torque exerted on the accretion disc caused by a magnetic field anchored on a rapidly rotating primary star @xcite ( a white dwarf magnetic field strength of b @xmath0 10@xmath2 g was assumed for wz sge by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", mass would accumulate at large radii leaving a truncated and stabilised ( with respect to frequent dne outbursts ) outer disc which acts as a large reservoir of mass .",
    "if the same physical mechanism was responsible for the long inter - outburst timescales of all of the wz  sge stars , it may be reasonable to expect their outbursts to look very similar . in this respect",
    ", the differences between the observed outburst properties of gw  lib and wz  sge , as outlined above , are puzzling .",
    "the detailed emission physics of the magnetic propeller models in particular is not well - understood , making theoretical predictions of multiwavelength outburst lightcurves extremely difficult .",
    "however , we note that both the low viscosity and disc truncation mechanisms tend to reduce the accretion rate during quiescence and may explain the low and decreasing x - ray flux in gw  lib between outbursts .",
    "also , in the case of gw lib , the x - rays are quenched on a timescale of @xmath0 10 days .",
    "the only plausible timescale close to this value is the viscous time of the accretion disc . interpreting this as a viscous timescale , t@xmath3 @xmath0",
    "r@xmath4/@xmath5c@xmath6h , we obtain an associated radius of r @xmath0 10@xmath7 cm , where we have assumed that the viscosity in the hot state @xmath8 , sound speed c@xmath6 = 10 km s@xmath9 , and disc scale height = 0.1 r. this estimate is interesting as it is close to the required values for disc truncation .",
    "thus it is conceivable that the quenching of the x - ray flux is associated with the inward progression of the accretion disc toward the white dwarf , and the eventual development of a boundary layer , once the outburst has been triggered .",
    "we have obtained optical , uv and x - ray observations of the 2007 outburst of the wz sge type dwarf nova gw lib .",
    "gw lib stands out as the second known dwarf nova , in addition to u gem , where hard x - rays are not suppressed during outburst . rather than having a remarkably high x - ray luminosity in an outburst",
    ", gw lib has a very low x - ray luminosity in quiescence compared to other dwarf novae .",
    "the outburst x - ray lightcurve of gw lib shows some similarities with other dwarf novae , such as a bump seen at the end of the x - ray lightcurve and hardening of the x - rays towards the end of the outburst .",
    "these features are also seen in ss cyg .",
    "wz sge and gw lib show some differences in their outburst data : the hard x - rays in wz sge are suppressed and the x - rays decline with a much smaller factor in the beginning of the x - ray lightcurve compared to gw lib .    a supersoft component , which probably originates from the optically - thick boundary layer , is detected in the first outburst spectrum .",
    "other systems , such as vw hyi and wz sge also show this component in their outburst data .",
    "the spectral resolution of the _ swift _ xrt or uvot is not sufficient to distinguish emission or absorption lines in the spectra .",
    "the outburst x - ray luminosity at the optical maximum was three orders of magnitude higher than during the pre - outburst quiescence level in 2005 .",
    "gw lib was still an order of a magnitude brighter during the 2008 and 2009 post - outburst observations than during the pre - outburst observations .    the long recurrence time and",
    "the lack of normal outbursts suggest that the structure of the accretion disc could be explained by models which favor very long recurrence times .",
    "the two main categories for these models are : 1 ) low disc viscosity in quiescence and 2 ) a truncated inner disc due to a magnetic propeller white dwarf . assuming that the outbursts of all wz sge stars would be driven by a similar physical mechanism , the observed differences in the outburst data of gw lib and wz sge are perplexing .",
