    "the star formation in the early universe provides important clues on the understanding of both galaxy formation and the ionization state of intergalactic matter ( e.g. , loeb & barkana 2001 ) .",
    "currently , two alternative methods are frequently used to find very high-@xmath11 objects ; one is to search for strong emission - line objects by using narrow - passband filters ( e.g. , hu et al . 2002 ; ouchi et al . 2003 ; ajiki et al .",
    "2003 ; kodaira et al . 2003 ; see for a review , taniguchi et al . 2003 ) , which selectively picks up high-@xmath11 objects with a strong emission line such as ly@xmath4 ( ly@xmath4 emitters ; hereafter laes ) .",
    "the other method is to search for redshifted lyman - break objects based on broad - band color selections ( e.g. , steidel et al .",

    "since this method relies on the stellar lyman - break spectral feature , this method tends to select high-@xmath11 galaxies with strong uv continuum emission , i.e. , lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) .",
    "since some of lbgs also show a strong ly@xmath4 emission , laes may be regarded as a subclass of lbgs ( see , e.g. , shapley et al .",

    "the use of a @xmath44 slit gave a spectroscopic resolution of 9.0    at 9000    that is measured by atmospheric oh airglow lines .",

    "the spatial sampling was 0@xmath4631 per resolution element as we adopted 3 pixel on - chip binning .",

    "typical seeing size was @xmath47 during the observation .",
    "we also obtained the spectra of spectroscopic standard stars hz 44 and feige 34 for flux calibration .",
    "as mentioned above , sdf j132440.6 + 273607 was selected by its red @xmath3 color , i.e. , so - called @xmath1-dropout selection .",
    "indeed this object is not detected above the 3@xmath48 level on the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath1 , and @xmath29 images .",
    "sdf j132440.6 + 273607 is clearly detected in the @xmath6 and @xmath8 images ; the 2@xmath460 aperture magnitudes are @xmath49 mag and @xmath50 mag . since the 3@xmath48 limiting magnitude of @xmath1 is @xmath51 mag , sdf j132440.6 + 273607 has a color of @xmath52 , satisfying our criterion for the @xmath1-dropout selection , @xmath36 .",
    "the optical thumbnail images are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the image size of sdf j132440.6 + 273607 in fwhm is 5.8 pixels or @xmath53 in the @xmath6-band image and 6.0 pixels or @xmath54 in the @xmath8-band image , respectively",
    ". both of these two images may be only marginally larger than the psf size .    in figure 2",
    ", we show the sky - subtracted optical position - velocity spectrogram and sky - subtracted one - dimensional spectrum of sdf j132440.6 + 273607 , obtained by focas on subaru . the aperture size to extract the one dimensional spectrum is 5 binned pixels ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "we can see a prominent single emission line whose peak is at 8909@xmath5 , and no significant continuum emission in the whole of the covered wavelength range . the spectral feature seen at @xmath78885@xmath5",
    "is a residual of the sky subtraction .",
    "the observed velocity width of the emission line is @xmath56 in fwhm , roughly comparable to the instrumental width .",
    "however , we can see a clear asymmetric feature below the half maximum of the emission line ; i.e. , a very prominent redward tail which extends up to @xmath57 .",
    "this asymmetry and the photometric property strongly suggest that the detected emission line is the ly@xmath4 emission and that sdf j132440.6 + 273607 is at @xmath58 .",
    "note that this object is thought not to be an emission - line object at lower redshift ; i.e. , an h@xmath4 emitter at @xmath59 , an [ o iii]@xmath605007 emitter at @xmath61 , or an h@xmath62 emitter at @xmath63 .",
    "this is because there is no emission lines in the covered wavelength range other than the prominent emission at 8909@xmath5 .",
    "we can not completely deny the possibility that sdf j132440.6 + 273607 is a [ o ii]@xmath603727 emitter at @xmath64 , because the [ o ii]@xmath603727 doublet can not be resolved by our observation ( the expected wavelength separation of the [ o ii ] doublet is 6.7@xmath5 ) .",
    "however , this does not seem plausible because the observed red tail or shoulder of the detected emission line is hard to be understood if the emission line is [ o ii]@xmath603727 .",
    "therefore , taking both the photometric and the spectroscopic properties into account , we conclude that sdf j132440.6 + 273607 is a strong ly@xmath4 emitter without strong uv stellar continuum emission at @xmath58 .",
    "the observed ly@xmath4 flux is @xmath65 ergs s@xmath17 @xmath66 , where the slit loss is not taken into account .",
    "the ly@xmath4 luminosity is thus calculated to be 1.8 @xmath67 ergs s@xmath17 .",
    "based on the ly@xmath4 flux obtained by the spectroscopy , we can derive a ly@xmath4-corrected @xmath6 magnitude , @xmath68 = 26.16 mag , which is very close to the @xmath8 magnitude . since our @xmath10-dropout search is complete only down to @xmath69 mag , we could not pick up sdf j132440.6 + 273607 as an @xmath10-dropout object if there were no strong ly@xmath4 emission ; i.e. , @xmath70 , which does not satisfy our @xmath10-dropout criterion ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "then we focus on the depressed @xmath8 magnitude compared to the @xmath33 magnitude ; i.e. , @xmath9 mag .",
    "if we assume that the depression of the @xmath8 magnitude is caused only by the contribution of the ly@xmath4 emission in the @xmath33 band , the required flux of the ly@xmath4 emission is @xmath71 ergs s@xmath17 @xmath66 .",
    "this is consistent with the spectroscopically measured ly@xmath4 flux , where we assume that all of the @xmath8 flux is attributed to the stellar uv continuum emission .",
    "this assumption leads to the uv continuum flux density of @xmath72 ergs s@xmath17 @xmath66 @xmath73 , which is consistent with the non - detection of the continuum emission in our optical spectroscopy of sdf j132440.6 + 273607 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "as presented in the last section , our spectroscopic observation discloses that sdf j132440.6 + 273607 is a strong lae with only faint uv stellar emission , despite the fact that it has been originally selected as an @xmath10-dropout galaxy candidate by its red @xmath3 color .",
    "this lae is thought to be an actively star - forming galaxy , though we can not completely reject the possibility that it is a narrow - line qso .",
    "although the stellar continuum emission is not detected in our spectroscopy , we can estimate the equivalent width of the ly@xmath4 emission based on the @xmath8 data .",
    "the photometrically determined ly@xmath4 equivalent width of sdf j132440.6 + 273607 is @xmath74 .",
    "we then obtain the equivalent width at the rest frame ; @xmath75 .",
    "the derived equivalent width is very large as a broad - band selected galaxy , since a very small fraction of lbgs at @xmath76 show @xmath77 ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "1999 ; shapley et al .",
    "rather this extremely large equivalent width seems more similar to the narrow - band selected galaxies ( e.g. , malhotra & rhoads 2002 ; ajiki et al .",
    "2003 ; hu et al .",
    "( 2004 ) recently found a number of laes with @xmath77 at @xmath78 by using a narrow - passband filter .",
    "note that lbgs and laes do not necessarily have completely distinct properties such as @xmath79 , because they are defined just by their selection method .",
    "however , it is not clear how these two populations overlap or how different statistically , especially at the very high-@xmath11 universe where the number of galaxies that have been investigated by spectroscopic observations is very small .",
    "spectroscopic observations on a large number of high-@xmath11 galaxies are also necessary to investigate whether or not the @xmath79 frequency distribution depends on redshift , which is also a very interesting issue .",
    "forthcoming intensive spectroscopic observations for high-@xmath11 galaxies will hopefully solve these problems .",
    "our finding of sdf j132440.6 + 273607 naturally leads to the following question : is this object a very peculiar object , or does any photometrically constructed @xmath10-dropout sample generally contain a lot of galaxies with only faint uv stellar continuum ? in order to investigate this issue , we focus on the photometrically - selected 48 @xmath10 dropout lbg candidates in sdf . in figure 3 , we show the @xmath80 colors of the @xmath10 dropout lbg candidates as functions of the @xmath33 magnitude and the @xmath81 color .",
    "the @xmath8 depression of sdf j132440.6 + 273607 is @xmath9 as mentioned above , whose statistical significance is roughly @xmath72@xmath48 .",
    "interestingly , there are other three @xmath10-dropout galaxy candidates which show significant @xmath8 depression above the 3@xmath48 level ( objects b , c , and e in the figure 3 )",
    ".    there are three possibilities for such @xmath8-depressed , @xmath10-dropout high-@xmath11 galaxy candidates .",
    "the first possibility is the lae at @xmath82 which corresponds to @xmath83 , just similar to the case of sdf j132440.6 + 273607 . in this redshift range",
    ", the ly@xmath4 emission falls only in the @xmath33 band and not in the @xmath8 one , which results in the @xmath8 depression .",
    "the second possibility is the `` @xmath8-dropout lbg '' ; i.e. , the lbgs at @xmath84 6.6 . in this case",
    ", the original categorization as @xmath10 dropout lbgs is not wrong , because the objects show the uv stellar continuum with a significant lyman break .",
    "the third possibility is the @xmath10 dropout galaxy with a significant absorption feature at the @xmath8 range , although it is not clear whether or not such an object really exists in such a high - redshift universe . in order to investigate these ideas further , we plot the expected colors of high-@xmath11 galaxies with a strong ly@xmath4 emission on the @xmath80 versus @xmath3 two - color diagram ( figure 3 ) . here",
    "we use the galaxy evolution model of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) by assuming that the star - formation rate of model galaxies is proportional to exp ( @xmath85 ) , where @xmath86 = 1 gyr and @xmath87 = 1 gyr are adopted . here",
    "we examine only three cases , i.e. , @xmath88 65 , 130 , and 260 @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath8 depression of @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 mag can be realized for the cases of @xmath88 65 , 130 , and 260 @xmath5 for the first possibility . on the other hand",
    ", more significant @xmath8 depression appears for the second possibility . as for the second possibility",
    ", a very red color of @xmath92 is also expected .",
    "however , an extremely deep @xmath1 image is required to discriminate these possibilities clearly . since the two @xmath8-depressed @xmath10 dropout objects with @xmath93",
    "may be @xmath8-dropout galaxies , a follow - up spectroscopic observation will be very interesting to access galaxies at @xmath94 .",
    "here we discuss the star - forming activity in sdf j132440.6 + 273607 .",
    "the ly@xmath4 flux of this object measured by our spectroscopy is 4.0 @xmath95 ergs s@xmath17 @xmath66 , which corresponds to the ly@xmath4 luminosity of 1.8 @xmath67 ergs s@xmath17 .",
    "we can estimate the star - formation rate ( sfr ) by using the following relation ; @xmath96 @xmath97 ( kennicutt 1998 ; brocklehurst 1971 ) .",
    "we then obtain @xmath98 yr@xmath17 .",
    "this is a lower limit because no correction was made for possible absorption effects on the ly@xmath4 emission .",
    "we can also estimate the sfr by the luminosity of the uv stellar continuum by adopting the following relation ; @xmath99 ( kennicutt 1998 ) . by using the uv continuum flux density measured from the @xmath8 magnitude , @xmath100 ( @xmath8 ) = @xmath101 ergs s@xmath17 @xmath66 hz@xmath17 , we obtain @xmath102 yr@xmath17 .",
    "one of the reason why @xmath103 is smaller than @xmath104 may be that @xmath105 would be underpredicted for for objects with a very large @xmath79 .",
    "this is because such a huge @xmath79 is hard to be created by a continuous star formation with a normal initial - mass function , which is assumed in the above relation between the sfr and the luminosity of the uv stellar continuum .",
    "schaerer ( 2000 ) presented that @xmath105 is underestimated for star - forming galaxies with an age of @xmath106 yr . taking all of above considerations into account ,",
    "we conclude that the sfr of sdf j132440.6 + 273607 is @xmath107 yr@xmath17 .",
    "since there may be a large number of objects with large @xmath79 as suggested by figure 3 , systematic spectroscopic studies on @xmath10-dropout galaxies are crucial to understand the star - forming activities of galaxies at @xmath12 , which is a very important epoch in relation to the cosmic reionization ."
