    "one important class of quadratic differentials with especially nice properties was introduced by j.  a.  jenkins and k.  strebel in the 50 s ; these differentials are called _ strebel _ or _ jenkins - strebel _ , see @xcite and   [ sec : non - chaotic ] below .    in applications to potential theory , asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials , wkb - methods in spectral theory of schrdinger equations in the complex domain one often encounters quadratic differentials which are non - strebel , but rather share some of their properties , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "a good example of such non - strebel differentials having many important properties is provided by polynomial quadratic differentials in @xmath0 , such that each zero is the endpoint of some critical trajectory .",
    "motivated by the above examples , we present below several natural classes of differentials containing the class of strebel differentials and possessing certain nice properties .",
    "the most general class we introduce is called _ non - chaotic _ and it is characterized by the property that the closure of any horizontal trajectory of such differential is nowhere dense .",
    "further we introduce a natural subclass of non - chaotic differentials which we call _ gradient _ and which is characterised by the property that at its smoothness points it is equal to @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we discuss the appropriate notion of positivity for gradient differentials .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in   [ sec : quadr ] we recall the basic facts about quadratic differentials and strebel differentials . in   [ sec : non - chaotic ]   we introduce and discuss a number of properties of non - chaotic differentials . in   [ sec : gradient ] we introduce and characterize gradient differentials . in ",
