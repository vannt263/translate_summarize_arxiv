    "the globular cluster palomar 11 ( pal 11 ) is located at @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ; @xmath7 ) in the constellation aquila .",
    "it sits roughly 13 kpc from the sun and 8 kpc from the galactic center with an estimated metallicity of @xmath8}=-0.4 $ ] ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter h96 ) .",
    "it belongs to the population of metal - rich clusters with @xmath9kpc often associated with the thick disk . however , pal 11 is located well outside the plane of the disk at @xmath10kpc @xcite",
    ".    there has been only one published color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for this cluster ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter obb01 ) .",
    "obb01 did note two other unpublished cmds from literature abstracts which derived some cluster properties for pal 11 ; @xcite and @xcite . while these sources derive some cluster parameters ( see table [ tbl1 ] for a list of published values ) , none of them report a value for the main sequence turnoff . in this paper a new v , v - i cmd for pal 11 with photometry reaching well past the main sequence turnoff is presented and used to determine the age of pal 11 .",
    "there are currently only 6 other thick disk clusters with age determinations @xcite .    in section 2 the details of the observations and photometry",
    "are discussed . in ",
    "3 we present the cmd and briefly discuss the blue straggler population , ",
    "4 determines the cluster parameters , such as distance , reddening , metallicity , and age . finally , ",
    "5 discusses these findings .",
    "observations of palomar 11 were obtained over five nights from september 4 to september 8 , 1999 with the 2.4 m hiltner telescope at the mdm observatory at kitt peak .",
    "all of the images were taken on a 2048x2048 ccd , though the image only covers 1760x1760 pixels to accommodate a 2 inch filter wheel .",
    "the images were taken at a scale of 0.275 arcsec per pixel for a field of view of @xmath11 square .",
    "table [ tbl2 ] shows a complete list of observations .    since the tidal radius of the cluster ( @xmath12 ; h96 ) is comparable to the image size",
    ", observations include images centered on the cluster as well as images offset a little more than @xmath13 south .",
    "this offset field is used to estimate the field star contamination .",
    "figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] are 1200s images in the v filter of pal 11 and the offset field .",
    "the image reductions were all done in iraf with its ccdproc routine .",
    "allstar and daophot @xcite were used in a standard manner to do crowded field photometry and extract instrumental magnitudes .",
    "all of images were matched and the coordinates of all stars were shifted onto a common coordinate system . to make our final photometry list we require that a star be detected in a minimum of 2 v and 2 i images .",
    "we find a total number of 6675 stars with v and i magnitudes .",
    "since none of the nights were photometric , we matched our stars to those of obb01 to determine the photometric transformations .",
    "matches were found for 583 stars , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "our mean photometric errors in the matched stars are 0.024 mag in v. fortunately , there are no apparent trends in the residuals between our photometry and the obb01 photometry as a function of magnitude or colour . a plot of the magnitude residuals is shown in figure [ ortfig ] . the bulk of the stars in the match had @xmath16 and @xmath17 and it would be difficult to detetect residual trends with magnitude or colour outside these ranges . as a result ,",
    "our photometric calibration is more uncertain for stars outside this magnitude and color range .",
    "fortuantely , the bulk of the pal 11 stars fall within this restricted magntiude and colour range .",
    "our photometry is presented in table [ tbl3 ] .",
    "the error in the photometry is based on the frame - to - frame variation in magnitude .",
    "the origin of the pixel reference frame is located in the southwest corner of the cluster frames .",
    "figure [ fig3]a shows the v , v - i cmd of all stars in our observations , figure [ fig3]b shows the cmd of the stars within the half - mass radius ( 2@xmath18 ; h96 ) of the cluster s center ( x=800 & y=820 ) and figure [ fig3]c shows the cmd of the stars located in the equivalent area to the cluster center cmd but from regions on our image which are located farthest from the cluster center the center of the cluster was found by simply determining the peak in the star counts in the x and y directions .",
    "the main sequence , turn - off , and subgiant branch ( sgb ) are all clearly visible in both .",
    "the red giant branch ( rgb ) and the extremely red horizontal branch ( hereafter red clump or rc ) are also visible , but not as well populated .",
    "the fit to the rgb is overlaid on figure [ fig3]b ( see section 4.1 ) .",
    "the rc is sloping , which is an indication of differential reddening . to examine this , we examined the color of the turn - off as a function of position for stars in an annulus between 1@xmath19 to 2@xmath19 of the cluster center .",
    "the turn - off was found to be reddest northeast of the cluster center , with a variation in turn - off colour of @xmath20 to @xmath21 from the southwest to the northeast of the cluster center .",
    "the observational parameters of this cmd are presented in table [ tbl4 ] . in this table ,",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are the apparent v and i magnitudes for the rc , @xmath24 is the ( v - i ) color of the rgb at the height of the rc , @xmath25 is the apparent v magnitude of the sgb , 0.05 dex redder than the main sequence turnoff @xcite , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the apparent v magnitude and color of the main sequence turnoff .",
    "these quantities were derived using the mode of the magnitude or colour distribution for a given quantity . given that the cluster is centrally concentrated and has differential reddening",
    ", these modal values provide an esitimate of the various photometric quantities at the cluster center .    to estimate the field star contamination in the cluster cmd , star counts were made within @xmath28 of the cluster center and an equivalent area in the farthest corners from the cluster center .",
    "this ` background ' area starts @xmath29 from the cluster center , so likely contains some cluster stars . within @xmath30 of the cluster center , there are 2670 stars , while there are 457 in the background area .",
    "this gives a maximum field star contamination of 17% .",
    "due to crowding , the photometry near the cluster center is not as deep or complete . restricting the star counts to @xmath31 , there are 1561 stars within @xmath30 of the center and 226 stars in the background region , yielding a maximum field star contamination of 15%",
    ".    the blue straggler population of pal 11 can be estimated in a similar manner . the photometric error in v and (",
    "v - i ) is used to define the blue straggler region in the cmd as stars with magnitudes brighter than @xmath32 and with colors bluer than @xmath33 .",
    "these values are @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this box is extended to half a magnitude below the rc ( @xmath36 ) and to @xmath37 in color ( see figure [ fig3]b ) . in this region of the cmd , there are 44 stars within @xmath28 of the cluster center and 13 in the background region .",
    "thus , about one - third of the stars in the blue straggler region are field stars , yielding an estimated number of blue stragglers of @xmath38 . for comparison ,",
    "there are 20 rc stars within @xmath30 of the cluster center and 1 star in the region of the rc in the background field .",
    "this yields a fraction of blue straggler stars of @xmath39 .",
    "the blue straggler fraction within a globular cluster is a function of the integrated cluster luminosity @xcite .",
    "pal 11 has an integrated absolute visual magnitude of @xmath40 , using the integrated visual magnitude of @xmath41 from h96 and the distance modulus derived in ",
    "[ dist ] . for its luminosity ,",
    "pal 11 has a high blue straggler population compared to other globuluar clusters @xcite .",
    "the distance and reddening to pal 11 can be estimated from the apparent magnitude of the red clump ( @xmath42 ) using the method described by @xcite .",
    "we determine @xmath43 and @xmath44 , using the hipparcos parallax calibration combined with a correction for the differences in age and metallicity ( @xmath45 ) between our stars and the hipparcos calibration stars @xcite .",
    "these values depend on metallicity , so calculations were made at both @xmath8}=-0.7 $ ] and @xmath8}=-0.4 $ ] to compare with the range of previously published values . above an age of 9 gyr , @xmath46 has a negligible age dependence , so we assume an age greater than 9 gyr to determine corrections ( see section 4.3 for a discussion of age ) .",
    "these calculations yield values of @xmath47 ; @xmath48 for @xmath8}=-0.7 $ ] and @xmath49 ; @xmath50 for @xmath8}=-0.4 $ ] .    assuming a standard extinction law @xcite the following",
    "are derived : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 kpc .",
    "these numbers are in general agreement with other numbers published in the literature , although our reddening is slighter lower and distance slightly higher than previous estimates ( see table [ tbl1 ] ) .",
    "the metallicity of pal 11 has been determined using spectroscopy of the ca ii triplet @xcite .",
    "the index used is the reduced equivalent width of the calcium lines for rgb stars in a cluster , denoted @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "however the current error bars for pal 11 are significant , with @xmath59 . in terms of metallicity , this gives roughly @xmath60=-0.7\\pm0.2 $ ] based on the updated calibration of @xmath58 by @xcite . two clusters with a similar ca ii index",
    "are 47 tuc and ngc 5927 , with @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "these two clusters likely bracket pal 11 in metallicity .",
    "the color of the rgb depends primarly on metallicity and reddening , with a smaller dependance on age .",
    "this fact has been used by @xcite to develop a method to simultaneously determine [ fe / h ] and e(v - i ) , using indicators based on the rgb color and slope .",
    "this method requires a polynomial fit to the rgb .",
    "the fit was determined using a two - step process .",
    "first , a rough fiducial was determined by eye . a standard third - order",
    "polynomial fit ( with no weighting ) was then made to stars which were within 0.10 in v - i of this fidicual and which do not belong to the rc .",
    "the leads to the following fit to the rgb @xmath63 this fit is superimposed on the data in figure [ fig3]b .    using this equation and following the procedure outlined by @xcite and the updated calibrations of @xcite based on the @xcite metallicity scale ,",
    "the metallicity and reddening of pal 11 are determined . for this purpose ,",
    "the mean magnitude of the red clump is used as the magnitude of the horizontal branch .",
    "we derive a metallicity of @xmath8}=-0.76 $ ] and a reddening of @xmath64 .",
    "this implies @xmath65 .",
    "these same methods were applied to photometry for 47 tuc @xcite and ngc 5927 @xcite . for 47 tuc",
    "we derive a metallicity of @xmath66}=-0.76 $ ] and a reddening of @xmath67 . for ngc 5927",
    "we get @xmath8}=-0.77 $ ] and a reddening of @xmath68 .",
    "these reddenings are universally lower than published values , and so suggests that the derived reddening values may not be reliable .",
    "it is not clear why the derived reddenings are lower than previous estimates , but could be related to the fact that the clusters studied here are all of relatively high metallicity , and the emperically calibration of the colour of the rgb as a function of reddening and metallicity may not be reliable for these high metallicity clusters .",
    "the derived metallicities are the same for the three clusters .",
    "however , 47 tuc was the most metal rich cluster used to calibrate this method .",
    "the metallicity derived for ngc 5927 is lower than that inferred from the ca ii index @xmath8 } = -0.64 $ ] @xcite ; and from fe measurements based upon fe ii lines @xmath8}=-0.67 $ ] @xcite .",
    "it is considerably lower than that determined by @xcite , @xmath8}=-0.37 $ ] .",
    "thus , it appears that one can not extrapolate the method of @xcite past the metallicity of 47 tuc .",
    "it is quite possible that pal 11 is as metal - rich as ngc 5927 .",
    "stellar evolution tracks were constructed using stellar evolution code described by @xcite for masses in the range of 0.5 m@xmath69 to 2.0 m@xmath69 in increments of 0.05 m@xmath69 .",
    "the models include the diffusion of helium and heavy elements .",
    "a solar calibrated model was calculated yielding @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( initial abundances ) . for other metallicities ,",
    "@xmath72 was assumed ( corresponding to a primordial helium abundance of @xmath73 ) .",
    "the solar calibrated mixing length was used for all the models .",
    "the transformation from the theoretical temperatures and luminosities to observed colors and magnitudes was completed using the @xcite color tables .    for these isochrones , the magnitude of the sgb , 0.05 magnitudes redder than the turnoff was used to calculate the difference in magnitude between the sgb and the semi - empirical @xmath74 determined above .",
    "this gives us @xmath75 as a function of age at two different metallicities ( see table [ tbl5 ] ) . from table",
    "[ tbl5 ] , it is clear that @xmath75 has little sensitivity to metallicity over the range @xmath8 } = -0.4 $ ] to @xmath76 and so can provide a robust estimate of the age of pal 11 even though its metallicity is not well constrained . for pal 11 , @xmath77 , which gives it an estimated age of @xmath78 gyr . for comparison , 47",
    "tuc and ngc 5927 were analyzed in the same manner yielding @xmath79 and @xmath80 , corresponding to ages of @xmath81 and @xmath78 gyr respectively .",
    "figures [ fig4]a & [ fig4]b show the cmd of pal 11 with the cmds of 47 tuc and ngc 5927 overlaid , respectively .",
    "the cmds of the two comparison clusters are shifted in color to match the turnoff color and in v magnitude to match the sgb of pal 11 .",
    "the rgbs and the rcs of pal 11 and ngc 5927 overlap , suggesting that they are similar in age and metallicity . on the other hand ,",
    "47 tuc has a slightly bluer rgb suggesting a different age or metallicity ( or both ) .    to estimate the implied age and/or metallicity difference , the difference in color between the main sequence turnoff and the base of the rgb as a function of age and metallicity ( @xmath82 ( v - i ) )",
    "was measured in the isochrones .",
    "this index is sensitive to age and metallicity @xcite .",
    "the base of the rgb is defined as the point where a straight line fit to the rgb crosses the measured value of @xmath25 as measured above .",
    "these theoretical values are compared to the observed data .",
    "pal 11 has @xmath83 and 47 tuc has @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "based upon the isochrones , this difference implies that pal 11 is 1 gyr older or 0.15 dex more metal rich than 47 tuc .",
    "a new cmd for pal 11 has been presented which reaches roughly 4 magnitudes past the main sequence turnoff . using the magnitude of the rc , and",
    "the method of @xcite leads to a distance of @xmath85 kpc and a mean reddening of @xmath86 .",
    "these values are in general agreement with previously published values .",
    "there is differential reddening across cluster , such that stars in in the northeast of the cluster are approximately 0.07 mag redder in v ",
    "i than stars in the southwest part of the cluster . following the method of @xcite",
    ", we find that pal 11 has a similar metallicity to the metal rich clusters 47 tuc and ngc 5927 .    using the difference in magnitude between the sgb and rc , an age of @xmath87 gyr is determined for pal 11 .",
    "this is the first age estimate for pal 11 .",
    "very similar ages are found for 47 tuc and ngc 5927 . after shifting to a common reddening and distance modulus ,",
    "the cmds of pal 11 and ngc 5927 are nearly identical , which implies that these clusters have the same age and metallicity .",
    "in contrast , the rgb of 47 tuc is slighter bluer than the pal 11 rgb .",
    "this implies that pal 11 and 47 tuc must differ in age by 1 gyr or in metallicity by 0.15 dex .",
    "given that the cmds of ngc 5927 and pal 11 are very similar and ngc 5927 has a higher ca ii triplet equivalent width than 47 tuc , it is likely that pal 11 has a similar age to 47 tuc , but is slightly more metal - rich . in agreement with previous studies @xcite",
    "we find no evidence for an age dispersion among the thick disk clusters in the milky way .",
    "this suggests that the stars in the thick disk clusters formed over a relatively short time - scale ( @xmath88myr ) .",
