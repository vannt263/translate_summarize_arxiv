    "the simplest model for the mott insulating states of the @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath8 and @xmath9[pd(dmit)@xmath3]@xmath3 salts is the half - filled hubbard model on the anisotropic triangular lattice @xcite ( see fig . [",

    "the heisenberg model on the isotropic triangular lattice without ring exchange ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) has been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "anderson first proposed the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) spin liquid state as a possible ground state of the isotropic triangular lattice @xcite .",

    "alternative models such as the quarter - filled hubbard model , with each site representing a monomer @xcite and multi - orbital models @xcite have also been proposed .",
    "these works do not consider ring exchange and it is believed that additional interaction terms beyond the nearest neighbour heisenberg model need to be included to help understand and explain why some materials have magnetically ordered or spin liquid ground states .",

    "it is therefore interesting to study the effect of the full ring - exchange term on the observed magnetic properties of the anisotropic triangular lattice .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate the effect of ring exchange on the magnetic properties of the anisotropic triangular lattice , using linear spin - wave theory .",
    "linear spin - wave theory provides an important benchmark , and is a good starting point for more technical studies .",
    "furthermore , we will explicitly compare the behaviour of the model keeping only spin - exchange or four - spin exchange terms from ring exchange with the full model considering both exchange terms .",
    "for the full model we found nel order is robust to ring exchange for @xmath48 , being stable up to around @xmath49 for @xmath50 . for @xmath51 ,",
    "minima develop along the @xmath52 direction which cause the nel order to become destabilized .",

    "the spiral phase was only able to survive up to @xmath53 for @xmath25 in constast to @xmath54 found classically . in the weakly - coupled chain limit of our model",
    "@xmath55 we found spiral order persists in the presence of weak frustration from ring exchange ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "this is highly analogous to the ` order - by - disorder ' mechanism due to quantum or thermal fluctuations @xcite . in a large region of the quantum phase diagram ,",
    "the classically stable collinear phase is wiped out and replaced with a spin - liquid phase .",
    "analysis of the spin - wave spectra show that the spin liquid is a consequence of competition between classical ordered states .",
    "the present work is organised as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we introduce the anisotropic triangular lattice with ring exchange model .",

    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "we are interested in understanding the magnetic properties of the @xmath0 multiple - spin exchange hamiltonian @xcite on an anisotropic triangular lattice involving ring exchange on four sites at @xmath1 : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 measure the relative strengths of the nearest neighbour and next - nearest neighbour spin exchange , while @xmath60 , and @xmath61 measure the relative strengths of the ring exchange terms on four - sites ( since there are three ways to have four - site rings on the anisotropic triangular lattice c.f .",

    "the permutation operator which exchanges two spins on sites @xmath65 and @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the usual spin operator on site @xmath65 , while @xmath69 cyclically permutes four spins around a plaquette , cf .",

    "it is helpful to note that , to lowest order in @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath72 . in this work",
    "we take this equality to hold , primarily to limit the size of the parameter space of the model .",
    "writing out the hamiltonian in terms of spin operators gives : @xmath73 the first term @xmath74 arises from the usual heisenberg exchange terms on the anisotropic triangular lattice @xmath75 the next term @xmath76 arises from the two - spin terms from the four - spin permutation operators .",
    "physically it dresses the nearest - neighbour and next - nearest - neighbour exchange strengths and induces next - next nearest neighbour contributions in the heisenberg model : @xmath77 the final term consists of the four - spin plaquette terms on the anisotropic triangular lattice . @xmath78 where @xmath79 we are interested in the relative effects of each of the terms in eq . .",

    "these three models will be referred to as the `` full '' ,  extended heisenberg \" , and `` plaquette '' models .",
    "the four - spin terms in eq . are decoupled in a leading order mean - field approximation taking @xmath82 so that    @xmath83    at this level of approximation ring - exchange contributes by dressing the effective two spin exchange and , in particular , introduces additional long - range frustrated interactions @xmath84 where @xmath85 describes an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction in the @xmath86 direction . here",

    "we will see below that this stabilisation of the spiral phase is reflected in the quantum calculations .    for the plaquette model ,",
    "we find that the critical point between the nel and spiral phases is independent of ring exchange classically since the ordering vector for the spiral phase in this model ( eq . )",

    "it is also interesting to note that for @xmath30 , the spiral order is more robust to the disordering effects induced by the ring exchange than for any other value of @xmath41 even classically .",
    "the effective two spin exchange couplings of hamiltonian ( [ eq : bighamiltonian ] ) are @xmath204 and @xmath205 implying that @xmath206 for all @xmath33 when @xmath207 .",
    "furthermore , the strong geometrical frustration suppresses nel and collinear phases thereby decreasing their ability to compete with spiral phase and drive an instability to the quantum spin liquid .",

    "[ fig : collinearunstable](a ) we plot the minimum values ( with respect to @xmath211 ) of eq . and notice that @xmath212 for the entire parameter space considered .",
    "therefore we conclude that competition with other classical phases means that the collinear phase is not stable in our calculations .",
    "an important question to answer is why is the collinear phase so fragile in the quantum calculations for the full model . to address this we consider explicit expressions for the spin - excitation spectrum in the collinear phase for the extended heisenberg    @xmath213    and plaquette models @xmath214    we plot the values of the minima ( with respect to @xmath211 ) of eqs . and eq . in figs .",

    "there is a broad region of the phase diagram where the collinear phase is stable for the extended heisenberg model , but is unstable in the entire parameter space considered for the plaquette model .",
    "therefore , we conclude that it is the four - site ring exchange terms , rather than the renormalization of the exchange couplings that destabilizes the collinear phase .    one might wonder whether the instability of the collinear phase at harmonic order ( leading order in @xmath117 ) in the spin wave calculations is due to the spin waves in this phase not being properly described by this level of treatment .",
    "hartree - fock corrections , coming from the spin - wave interaction terms could stabilize the collinear phase .",

    "so far we have limited the discussion to the spin degrees of freedom only . however , in the materials of interest , particularly the organic charge transfer salts , the charge degrees of freedom eventually become important and a mott transition occurs under pressure . for @xmath30 ( 120@xmath215 ) spiral order is found for @xmath216 .",

    "@xcite this is consistent with the observation@xcite that organic charge transfer salts with @xmath35 undergo a mott transition directly from a magnetically ordered phase to a superconducting / metallic phase . whereas salts with @xmath220 display spin liquid ( or other exotic quantum ) phases .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : proposed ] we present a qualitative sketch of a proposed phase diagram for the hubbard model on the anisotropic triangular lattice with ring exchange .",
    "the boundary lines for the nel and spiral ordered phases are based on the linear spin - wave theory for the full model , reported above .",

    "[ fig : proposed ] is simply a smooth curve joining these points .",
    "nevertheless this simple analysis suggests that there will be a region of the phase diagram in the full model where the magnetic orderings compete strongly enough to induce a stable spin - liquid region . comparing the observed phase diagrams of the @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath223 and @xmath9[pd(dmit)@xmath3]@xmath3 salts to this picture and taking into account the frustration ( @xmath41 ) estimated from first principles calculations @xcite",
    "one finds that this is consistent with what is observed experimentally .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the competition between different long range order states creates a quantum disordered phase in the anisotropic triangular lattice heisenberg model with ring exchange even at the semiclassical level .",
    "analysis of the spin wave spectra show that the spin liquid state is a consequence of competition between classical ordered states .",
    "thus we conclude that the interplay of ring exchange and geometrical frustration is responsible for the spin liquid state found .",
    "our results are relevant to weak mott insulators _ i.e. _ insulators lying close to the insulator - to - metal transition so that ring exchange is relevant .",
