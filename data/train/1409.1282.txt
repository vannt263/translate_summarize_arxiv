    "opinion dynamics studies in network science @xcite have been concerned with the effect of social influence .",
    "prior research has shown that the interpersonal relationships in the network have a dominant effect even in presence of outside pressure @xcite ; such relations manifest themselves as large - scale changes to the opinions in the network .",
    "various models have been proposed to incorporate this effect such as the voter model @xcite , threshold model @xcite , bass model @xcite , and the naming game @xcite .",
    "the difference between the naming game and other models is that in the naming game an individual may possess more than one opinion at a time resulting in a mixed opinion state .",
    "this paper focuses on the naming game .    the naming game ( ng ) is an opinion based model in which each node ( individual ) in the network possesses a list of opinions which comprise its opinion state @xcite . in the version of ng model considered in this paper",
    "each interaction starts with randomly selecting the speaker first , and then randomly choosing the listener among the speaker s neighbors .",
    "the speaker then shares a randomly chosen opinion from its opinion state with the listener .",
    "various social rules are imposed to determine the outcome of such sharing .",
    "they can be classified into three types `` original '' , `` listener - only '' , and `` speaker - only '' @xcite . in all three cases , the listener adds the shared opinion if it does not have it as a part of its state .",
    "if it does , in the `` original '' version of ng , both the sender and the listener set their state to the single opinion shared in the interaction . for `` listener - only ''",
    "( `` speaker - only '' ) only the listener ( the speaker ) does so .",
    "this paper focuses on the `` listener - only '' variant of the naming game .",
    "although the naming game allows for many opinions and their subsets to define the states of the node , we restrict our attention to the simplest version of the model in which at most two opinions coexist in the network to which we will refer as binary ng model . for this model",
    "we study how modified rules of the outcomes of opinion sharing change the dynamics of the ng outcomes .",
    "several papers study the dynamics of the naming game in respect to the network topology @xcite .",
    "we have chosen an alternative approach in which the network topology is set to be a complete graph @xcite , so the intrinsic properties of the naming game can be analyzed .",
    "two of such properties are the global consensus in the network and the average time to reach it @xcite . for the simplified version of the naming game on a network with @xmath0 nodes , when the threshold fraction of committed agents has not been reached ,",
    "it has been shown by simulations in @xcite and by quasi - stationary approximation in @xcite that the time to consensus is @xmath1 .",
    "committed agents in the naming game are nodes in the network holding one opinion which they never alter . in the presence of committed agents",
    "@xcite , it is possible to achieve consensus on one opinion quickly when the fraction of committed agents is greater than a certain threshold . on a complete graph ,",
    "this threshold is @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the consensus time in such case drops to @xmath3 , as shown by an eikonal approximation in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", the threshold fraction of committed agents needed for fast consensus will be studied under modified rules on the interactions in the naming game .",
    "such modified rules have been studied previously by baronchelli et al . @xcite and strogatz group @xcite , among others . in the former work ,",
    "baronchelli et al . considers the `` original '' naming game with a parameter @xmath4 controlling the likelihood of the two interacting agents to update their states to the single opinion shared in their interaction .",
    "it was shown that a threshold of @xmath5 exists such that consensus does not occur below this threshold . in marvel",
    "@xcite , the authors attempt to promote a majority of mixed state holders in the network . in the next sections ,",
    "the proposed family of naming game models is defined and analyzed in terms of the stability of its equilibria .",
    "in this paper , we consider the binary `` listener - only '' naming game in which two unique opinions , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are spreading in the network .",
    "the evolution of the number of @xmath6 and @xmath7 opinion holders can be cast as a random walk in 2d space . instead of working at the micro - state level",
    ", we consider the macrostate of the system .",
    "each node in the network holds either one of the _ unique opinion _ , or their conjunction , denoted @xmath8 , to which for simplicity we will refer to as the _ mixed opinion_. the opinion state of the network at the macro level is a vector @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the number of nodes holding each of the three opinions . when considering the change in opinion state , @xmath12 , we are only concerned with changes to @xmath13 and @xmath14 since @xmath11 can be found from the constraint @xmath15 .    in the random walk , each interaction is assigned a probability based on the change of the opinion macro state at each time step .",
    "a mean field equation can be formed from these probabilities by calculating the expectation of change of macro state which represents the average motion of the system while ignoring any noise arising from randomness .",
    "stability analysis of the system s equilibria may then be performed .    after developing a drift equation",
    ", we shall assume the number of nodes , @xmath16 , in the network is large to removed fluctuations due to noise .",
    "the densities of individuals with each opinion state are considered , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the models presented in the following subsections are created by expansions of the original naming game with different agent interactions based upon social characteristics of the agents .",
    "these variants of the naming game define a two - parameter family with the original naming game being a special case in this family .",
    "we also stretch the notion of consensus to allow a _",
    "consensus _ of _ ab _ opinion .",
    "what is meant by such consensus is that the equilibrium point is stable and the majority of the nodes hold the mixed opinion _",
    "ab_.    following the presentation of the models ,",
    "linear stability analysis is used to uncover global effects of the variants of the naming game .",
    "prior work in the area of stability in the standard naming game has shown that there exist three equilibrium points : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , where the first two are stable and last is unstable @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium point @xmath23 should not be confused with baronchelli s threshold of parameter value @xmath24 .",
    "these equilibrium points lie in a center manifold where initial values of densities in _ a _ and _ b _ are vacuumed into a line and the system states moves along it to either of the stable points .",
    "the consensus the system reaches depends upon where the initial values of densities are located , i.e. , whether the initial state lies above or below the line bisecting the first quadrant .         the addition of committed agents to the stickiness model has been shown to hold similar properties to that of the naming game solely with committed agents .",
    "the stickiness model with committed agents has two bifurcations which create barrier to reaching an active steady - state at which the committed opinion becomes a global consensus .",
    "this model has properties similar to the stickiness model .",
    "when stickiness is weak , a barrier appears near the opinion without a committed majority , inhibiting any drift towards consensus on the opinion held by the committed agents . instead , a consensus - like state appears in the opposing opinion , as seen in the standard model for the naming game .",
    "as the fraction of committed agents reaches critical point , their influence overcomes the opinions of the populace and drives the system to consensus .",
    "when stickiness is strong , a barrier appears closer to the committed opinion critical fraction but it is buffered by the holders of mixed opinion , as seen in the model with only stickiness present .",
    "hence , the stickiness increases the critical fraction of committed agents necessary to overcome the mixed opinion holders barrier . with the fraction of committed agents below the critical threshold ,",
    "the state of the system becomes a consensus - like state with the majority of the network members holding mixed opinion .",
    "as the fraction of committed agents increases to critical point , the pull of the committed minority overcomes the power of stickiness , creating a strong drift towards consensus on the committed opinion .",
    "overall , the stickiness of holders strongly controls the dynamics of the committed agent model .",
