    "the close circumstellar environment around mature ( post - t  tauri and herbig ae / be ) stars has traditionally been difficult to study directly , due to the strong flux from the star itself , which drowns out the light of its physical surroundings over a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "however , developments in high - contrast and high - resolution instruments and techniques have made this environment increasingly accessible to detailed study in recent years .",
    "several surveys have been performed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a number of extrasolar planets have been imaged by now ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and while the most extreme debris disk systems have been possible to image for some time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sample of spatially resolved disks is presently growing rapidly , both in thermal ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and scattered radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , most planets and disks are still discovered only indirectly , through stellar radial velocity or transits in the case of planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and through infrared excess in the case of disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the strategic exploration of exoplanets and disks with subaru ( seeds ; * ?",
    "* ) is a large - scale survey using adaptive optics ( ao ) assisted high - contrast imaging for studying planets and disks , from primordial and transitional systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to mature systems . a sub - survey of this larger effort concerns the study of debris disk systems",
    "this study has several purposes , including : 1 ) searching for direct light from debris disks , in the sense of acquiring spatially resolved images of disks that have previously only been identified from infrared excess , 2 ) searching for planets in systems with known debris disks , and 3 ) studying interactions and correlations between planets and debris disks .",
    "interestingly , many of the recently imaged planets coincide with debris disks @xcite .",
    "many disks also have morphological indications of the presence of dynamical influence from planets in the system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such as eccentric gaps with sharp inner boundaries or apparently resonant dust concentrations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although alternative mechanisms have been suggested ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , stars hosting debris disks are promising targets for imaging of massive exoplanets .    in previous publications ,",
    "we have presented two results from the debris disk survey , in the form of spatially resolved disks around hr  4796  a @xcite and hip  79977 @xcite . here",
    ", we will summarize the results from the rest of the survey so far , including images of spatially resolved disks and detection limits for planets which are interpreted in the context of the disk architecture in the system , and which form part of the basis for a statistical study that is presently in progress ( brandt et al .",

    "a master list of targets was compiled from a wide range of literature sources identifying debris disk host stars based on infrared excess as measured by telescopes such as iras and spitzer ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "targets for specific seeds runs were then selected continuously from this list , prioritized on the basis of disk properties ( fractional luminosity and predicted angular separation ) and possible planet properties ( ease of detection , based on proximity and youth , as well as stellar mass assuming a constant typical planet - star mass ratio ) .",
    "special emphasis was placed on cold disks , characterized by the presence of dust at large physical separations but indications of gaps or cavities at smaller separations .",
    "such gaps could be caused by planets ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein . ) which could in turn be observable in high - contrast images .",
    "a few warm disks however were also observed ",
    "these could have planets at larger separations , and the disk in such systems should be highly luminous at small separations , where hiciao performs the most competitively .",
    "some high - profile planet - search targets were purposefully omitted  these are cases where specialized deep observations have been performed in dedicated studies , upon which it would be difficult or impossible to improve in a general survey with a 1  h observation in @xmath3-band .",
    "in particular , this is true for the targets @xmath4  eri and vega @xcite . the special case of fomalhaut ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was also omitted for this reason .",
    "histograms for the spectral type , distance , and age of the targets are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : hist_spt ] .",
    "the observations were carried out as part of the seeds program at the subaru telescope , using the hiciao camera @xcite with the ao188 adaptive optics system @xcite .",
    "the bulk of observations were taken throughout 2011 and 2012 , with some observations also taken in 2009 and 2010 ( see table [ t : observations ] ) .",
    "no mask was used , but the detector was instead allowed to saturate at the psf core , typically out to a radius of 0.3 .",
    "all observations made use of the angular differential imaging technique ( adi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the pupil fixed on the detector , and were performed using the @xmath3-band filter , with a central wavelength of 1.65  @xmath5 m and a bandwidth of 0.29  @xmath5 m . in most cases ,",
    "the instrument was set to direct imaging , but in a few cases , the polarimetric differential imaging ( pdi ) mode was used , in which the beam is split into two orthogonal polarization states using a wollaston prism , with each corresponding image mapped onto one half of the detector . in those cases , the results presented here are based on separate reductions of each polarization state , which we then average together .",
    "we do not include any pdi reductions in this study . the typical telescope time spent on a target was @xmath11  hour including overheads .",
    "the adi reductions were uniformly performed using the acorns - adi pipeline @xcite , with the same procedure as given in the acorns paper . as a brief summary",
    ", the data were destriped , flat fielded and corrected for field distortion .",
    "relative centroiding was done using psf fitting on non - saturated parts of the psf , and absolute centering was based on visual inspection with a @xmath10.5  pixel precision .",
    "psf subtraction was performed with a loci - based scheme ( locally optimized combination of images ; * ? ? ?",
    "as loci parameters we used a psf fwhm of 6 pixels , an angular protection zone of 0.7 fwhm , and 200 psf footprint optimization regions .",
    "individual psf - subtracted frames were de - rotated and combined using a trimmed mean approach to produce the final image ( see fig .",
    "[ f : hr4934im ] for an example ) . for each final image of a given target ,",
    "an s / n - map was produced by dividing the signal at all positions by the local noise ( calculated in an annulus at the corresponding separation ) . in this process , we include a correction for the signal attenuation imposed by the loci algorithm .",
    "the s / n - map provides a data format in which point sources can be easily identified and in which it can be determined whether or not they are statistically significant .",
    "detection limits for a 5.5@xmath6 criterion were produced by normalizing the radial noise profiles by the primary brightness , which was determined from non - saturated exposures acquired before and after each adi sequence .    )",
    ".,width=302 ]    in cases where candidates were present in the hiciao images and the targets had been previously observed with ao - assisted imagers , we analyzed the archival images using similar procedures as above , but adapted to the respective telescopes and instruments .",
    "images from gemini / niri @xcite , gemini / nici ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , keck / nirc2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , subaru / ircs @xcite and hst / nicmos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were used for this purpose , saving several hours of subaru telescope time that would otherwise have been necessary for executing follow - up observations in those cases , and thus demonstrating the broad utility of archiving data from large telescopes .",
    "as can be generally expected in a survey of this kind , many faint point sources are detected in the images , the majority of which are physically unrelated background stars . due to the fact that the contaminant fraction increases rapidly with angular separation from the parent star",
    ", small angular separations have been prioritized for follow - up .",
    "companion candidates that were detected in the data inside of 5  and with a @xmath75.5@xmath6 significance were checked for common proper motion by either using archival data when available , or second epoch observations over a @xmath11 year baseline ( see fig .",
    "[ f : hr4934astro ] for an example ) .",
    "no substellar companions have been verified so far among the targets .",
    "one target remains for which candidates inside of the priority region have not yet been followed up ; hd  162917 was observed in late 2012 and will be re - observed at a later stage . given the low galactic latitude of this target , the candidates are likely to be background stars .",
    "the point sources are listed in table [ t : pointsources ] .        in some cases , the debris disk itself could be spatially resolved in our images .",
    "two of these detections have been analysed in particular detail and published separately : hr  4796  a @xcite and hip  79977 @xcite .",
    "three other targets for which secure disk detections could be made are hd  15115 , au  mic , and hd  141569 .",
    "these cases are discussed in the individual notes below .",
    "the disk detection space of our survey has a very good complementarity to that of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "hst is able to observe at visible wavelengths with exquisite sensitivity and has a psf which is unaffected by the atmosphere , which means that it can observe faint and smooth disk emission .",
    "such emission is much more difficult to observe from the ground , since our near - infrared observations are more sensitivity limited , in addition to the fact that psf variations due to varying seeing are very similar in their characteristics to smooth disk material .",
    "in addition , this study has made use of adi , which benefits the detection of sharp features in the disk while strongly self - subtracting smooth emission , particularly if it is azimuthally symmetric .",
    "on the other hand , the high contrast and spatial resolution of hiciao allows for detection of disks and disk features at small angular separations , where hst is unable to provide a comparable performance .",
    "hence , we are unable to detect large - scale , smooth , and low - inclination structures such as the second ring of the hd  141569 disk , but can provide novel results on small - scale , sharp and high - inclination features such as the inner region of the hip  79977 disk .",
    "the contrast performances for point sources are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : dd_ccurves ] and listed in table [ t : contrasts ] .",
    "the achievable contrast is largely dependent on the field rotation during an observation .",
    "this is due to the connection between field rotation and adi perfomance .",
    "an increased total field rotation benefits adi because it maximizes the number of reference frames in which the planet signature is sufficiently separated from its location in the target frame to be useful , which helps as long as the number of reference frames does not become so large that the loci optimization becomes over - constrained . in our reductions , we avoid this over - constraining by limiting the number of reference frames for each target frame to @xmath180 , uniformly spread across the observing sequence , which we find to produce roughly optimal performance .",
    "the contrast depends not only on the total field rotation , but also on the rotation rate .",
    "this is caused by the fact that frames taken over a small time span tend to correlate better than frames taken over larger time spans .",
    "a larger rotation rate thus allows for usage of reference frames that are better correlated with the target frame .",
    "the rotation rate that can be acquired depends on the declination of the target  a minimal @xmath8 provides a maximal rotation rate , where @xmath9 is the declination and @xmath10 the latitude of the telescope .",

    "how the resulting physical separation relates to the semi - major axis of a given hypothetical shepherding planet in the system is another complex uncertainty . here",
    ", we simply take the @xmath16 itself to represent the physical scale around which we wish to evaluate the presence or absence of a planet ; the motivation being that the dominating disk flux should arise close to the inner edge ( since that is where the dust is hottest and , in general , most dense ) and that the planet responsible for carving the gap should be close to the edge .",
    "this is not necessarily relevant if , for instance , there are multiple planets responsible for the gap . with regards to planet detectability near the gap ,",
    "the gap locations adopted here are probably very conservative , as can be seen in @xcite . in all cases studied by @xcite where the real gap location could be observed , the real location is never smaller than the blackbody prediction , but is often larger by a factor 2 .",
    "we derive mass detection limits from the contrast curves using cond- and dusty - based evolutionary models @xcite and the age limits in table [ t : properties ] ( see fig . [",
    "f : dd_mcurves ] ) .",
    "cond was used whenever the predicted tempearture was below 1700  k , and dusty when it was above this limit .",
    "these ` hot - start ' models may over - predict the brightness for a given mass and age if the initial entropy is lower than assumed in those models ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the exoplanets that have been discovered to date are consistent with hot - start conditions and exclude at least the coldest ranges of initial conditions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the absence of heating from deuterium burning in the cond / dusty models may conversely under - predict the brightness for a given mass and age @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the uncertainties in mass - luminosity relationships is a further uncertainty that should be kept in mind .        in order to put the issue of gap - opening super - jupiters in a statistical context",
    ", we evaluate the probability that planets with masses similar to that of @xmath0  pic  b of @xmath110  @xmath2 ( * ? ? ? * and currie et al . in prep . ) would be detectable near the gap in each observed system .",
    "this is done by calculating the full projected separation distribution corresponding to a semi - major axis of @xmath16 for random orbital orientations and a uniform eccentricity distribution between 0.0 and 0.6 @xcite .",
    "the fraction of 10  @xmath2 planets that are detectable in a given system is denoted @xmath17 for the lower limit of the age of the star and @xmath18 for the upper limit .",
    "the individual values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 are listed in table [ t : properties ] . in some of the systems such",
    "a planet is simply not detectable ( 0% in both @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , while in the best cases the fraction is close to 100% . from the collection of these values and",
    "the fact that no planets were detected in the sample , we can estimate an upper limit on the frequency of planets with equal or higher mass than @xmath0  pic  b near the estimated gap edge , using bayes theorem following the procedure in @xcite . as a result",
    ", we find that at 95% confidence , @xmath1915.2% of the stars host such planets in the extreme case where the younger age limit is adopted in all cases , and @xmath1930.1% in the opposite case where the upper limits are adopted . in other words , if giant planets are a dominant cause of gaps in debris disks , the majority of them must be less massive than @xmath0  pic  b. in either case , it implies that @xmath0  pic  b is probably in the upper mass range of any gap - causing planets that may exist .",
    "an illustration of typical mass detection limits around @xmath16 for the individual stars is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : dd_edgemass ] , where the detectable mass is evaluated at @xmath20 , which represents the average angular separation of a planet with semi - major axis @xmath16 for random orbital orientations @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath21 denotes the distance to the target .",
    "the mass limits in our survey are contrast - limited rather than sensitivity - limited , hence it would be possible to substantially enhance the limits with upcoming extreme adaptive optics - assisted instruments such as sphere , gpi , or charis @xcite .",
    "these facilities may thus be able to detect a large number of gap - opening super - jupiters if they are relatively common , or otherwise put yet more stringent limits on their presence and properties .",
    "in this study , we have presented high - contrast imaging of a sample of 50 stars primarily in the g  a - type range with known infrared excess due to debris disks , using the hiciao camera at the subaru telescope .",
    "targets were particularly selected for if they had excess only at long wavelengths , implying cold debris disks with an inner gap , possibly carved out by massive planets within the disk .",
    "the targets were observed both in order to attempt to spatially resolve the disk , as well as to try to detect the putative planets that may be responsible for the disk morphology .",
    "no planets were discovered , despite the fact that @xmath0  pic  b - like planets ( @xmath110  @xmath2 ) could have been detected near the esimated gap edges in many cases .",
    "this led to an upper limit of 1530% on the frequency of such planets , implying that if planets are a general cause of the commonly existing gaps in debris disk systems , then they must generally be lower in mass than @xmath0  pic  b. five deris disks have been spatially resolved during the survey , two of which have already been presented in previous publications @xcite .",
    "future studies with upcoming instrumentation will be able to put yet more stringent constraints on planet occurrences in debris disk systems , by probing down to smaller planetary masses and smaller semi - major axes , and thus may conclusively address whether the gaps in debris disks are typically caused by planets , or whether other mechanisms dominate the disk architecture .",
