    "this energy is the inverse of the characteristic time @xmath13 for a particle to diffuse through the sample .",
    "@xmath14 is the diffusion coefficient . on the other hand , in the localized regime ,",
    "the correlations between levels are weaker and in the limit of an infinite system the statistics of energy levels becomes poissonnian .",
    "it has been argued that the statistics of energy levels _ at _ the metal  insulator transition ( mit ) is characterized by a third universal distribution which is a hybrid between the wigner and the poisson distributions .",
    "this was clearly shown by a numerical study of the scaling of the nearest neighbor level spacing distribution @xmath15@xcite .",
    "several other numerical works have confirmed this idea @xcite .",
    "moreover , by using diagrammatic calculations , semiclassical description and scaling arguments , it was found that long range correlations between levels exhibit a new power ",
    "law behavior whose exponent is related to the exponent @xmath16 of the localization length @xcite .",
    "there are several quantities which measure the fluctuations of energy levels . in the rmt",
    ", they depend only on the symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "if it is invariant under time reversal symmetry , the fluctuations are described by the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of random matrices ( @xmath17 ) . when time reversal symmetry is broken , the spectrum becomes more rigid ( gaussian unitary ensemble , gue , @xmath18 ) .",
    "these quantities are the following :    * the number variance @xmath19 @xmath20 it measures the fluctuation of the number of levels @xmath21 in a strip of width @xmath22 .",
    "the average @xmath23 can be taken either over different regions of the spectrum or over several realizations of disorder . in the rmt",
    ", @xmath19 increases logarithmically with @xmath22 . for @xmath24",
    ", it varies as @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the average interlevel spacing . * the distribution @xmath28 of the spacing @xmath29 between consecutive levels . in the rmt",
    ", it is well described by the wigner  surmise : @xmath30 , while , when there is no correlation between levels , it has a poisson behavior : @xmath31 . * the two - point correlation function of the density of states ( dos)@xcite .",
    "however , we have chosen to follow here the notations of refs.@xcite ] : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the average dos . using the definition of the dos ,",
    "@xmath34 can be simply rewritten as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the distribution of distances @xmath37 between levels separated by @xmath38 other levels@xcite . by definition @xmath39 .",
    "the number variance can obviously be written in terms of this two - point correlation function : @xmath40 * the form factor @xmath41 , fourier transform of @xmath34 : @xmath42 the interest of this quantity is that is can be directly related to some characteristics of the classical motion of the diffusive particles@xcite .",
    "although the number variance is most frequently used in the literature , it is not always the most appropriate quantity to describe the correlations , since it is a double integral of the dos - dos correlation function @xmath34 .",
    "thus the behavior of this quantity at an energy scale @xmath22 depends on the behavior of @xmath43 for _ all _ energies @xmath44 smaller than @xmath22 .",
    "that is why in this paper we have chosen to study @xmath34 as well as its fourier transform @xmath5 directly . although analytical predictions have been given for the asymptotic behavior of these quantities ( large energies or small times ) at the mit @xcite , nothing was known yet about the short range behavior of the correlations .",
    "it is one of the goals of this paper to study these correlations . in section 2",
    "we recall what is their behavior in the metallic regime and compare with numerical experiments . in section 3",
    ", we analyze the two point correlation function at the mit .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a discussion of level spacing distributions , and finally , in section 5 , we present our conclusions .",
    "efetov has shown that at energy scales smaller than the thouless energy @xmath45 , and in the limit where the dimensionless conductance @xmath46 is much larger than @xmath47 , i.e. far from a mit , the two - point correlation function @xmath34 is given by its expression in the gaussian rmt@xcite .",
    "this was confirmed numerically in the framework of the tight - binding anderson model with diagonal disorder : the number variance and the distribution @xmath15 were found to be very well described by the wigner - dyson predictions@xcite .",
    "we first show numerical results for the two - point correlation @xmath34 , fig.[f1 ] , and its fourier transform @xmath41 in the metallic regime , fig.[f2 ] .",
    "it is seen that the rmt result is a very good description of these correlations .",
    "they were obtained by exact diagonalization of a tight binding anderson hamiltonian with on  diagonal disorder via a lanczos routine .",
    "the diagonal elements are box ",
    "distributed around zero with a width @xmath48 , in units of the transfer integral @xmath49 .",
    "we only use eigenvalues which lie in a central energy strip whose width is chosen such that it contains approximately half the number of all eigenvalues .",
    "even though the average density of states ( dos ) is almost constant in this region , special care has to be taken in unfolding the spectrum .",
    "then we calculate @xmath34 defined in eq.[rdes ] .",
    "thus , @xmath50 is the distribution of differences of eigenvalues in the energy interval @xmath51 used for averaging .",
    "in addition , we average on different disorder configurations . the self - correlation of the levels is not included in the numerical calculation of @xmath34 .",
    "a @xmath52 function has to be added to the result .",
    "using rather small systems but many disorder realizations ( @xmath53 sites and 1000 disorder realizations for @xmath54 ) , we are able to obtain a large amount of eigenvalues and correspondingly rather smooth curves for @xmath55 .",
    "as shown in fig.[f1]b , the numerical precision is even high enough to allow for the observation of the tiny oscillations in @xmath55 in the gue case where @xmath56 .",
    "let us briefly recall some important features of these correlation functions .",
    "it is helpful to use a semiclassical argument developped by argaman _",
    "et al._@xcite in which the function @xmath41 is directly related to the return probability @xmath57 after a time @xmath49 for a classical diffusive particle .",
    "more precisely : @xmath58 the factor @xmath59 in the numerator arises from interference effects between time reversed paths , in the absence of magnetic field or flux .",
    "this relation is valid for classical times @xmath49 much smaller than the heisenberg time @xmath60 . and characteristic times ,",
    "see ref.@xcite ] for time scales larger than @xmath61 , the diffusion is homogeneous so that @xmath57 is constant .",
    "this gives a linear behavior for @xmath41 as observed in fig.[f2 ] .",
    "for @xmath62 , @xmath41 has to saturate . in the energy space",
    ", @xmath63 has first a @xmath52 peak at the origin which describes the self correlation of the levels .",
    "fourier transform of this peak implies that @xmath64 for large @xmath49 . for small energies , there is a relation between the function @xmath34 and the distribution of interlevel spacings @xmath15 : @xmath65 so that indeed @xmath34 starts linearly at small @xmath6 in the absence of a magnetic field . at larger energies",
    ", @xmath34 varies like @xmath66 .",
    "unless otherwise specified , we will now consider the case @xmath67 , i.e.  no magnetic field .    for time scales smaller than @xmath68 ,",
    "the diffusion is non homogeneous and the classical return probability varies as @xmath69 so that @xmath41 scales like @xmath70 . for @xmath71 , its fourier",
    "transform @xmath34 is given by : @xmath72 and the number variance behaves like @xmath73 for @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "this `` altshuler  shklovski '' power - law behavior had not been seen numerically yet @xcite .",
    "this is because there is a long cross  over regime around the energy scale @xmath45 , and the power law",
    "is expected to be visible for very large energy scales @xmath75 . in the intermediate regime @xmath76 ,",
    "the quantization of the diffusion modes has to be taken into account : @xmath77 using a large system with small @xmath45 , we have calculated @xmath19 numerically and found the onset of the power law .",
    "@xmath19 starts to be proportional to @xmath78 only for energies @xmath79 ( see fig.[f3 ] ) .",
    "if one takes into account the fact that for a finite system of size @xmath80 the condition @xmath81 should be fullfilled in order to neglect finite size effects , and if one wants to observe the power law over at least one decade of energy , the size of the system should be at least of the order @xmath82 .",
    "on the other hand , the discrete sum describes the numerically calculated @xmath19 very well , and a fit to this sum with @xmath45 as only fitting parameter allows for a precise determination of the thouless energy of the sample ( fig.[f3 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that this contribution of the finite-@xmath83 diffusion modes is hardly visible on the two - point correlation function @xmath84 . for a metal in three dimensions",
    ", @xmath84 varies at large energies positively like @xmath85 instead of @xmath86 for rmt , meaning that the levels tend to attract each other at large energies@xcite .",
    "however , these deviations from rmt are very small , less than a few percent .",
    "we have not been able to see them on the numerically calculated @xmath84 , see fig.[f1 ] . for the same reason ,",
    "the deviations from the linear behavior of @xmath5 for @xmath87 are not visible . moreover , in the metallic regime that we have studied ( @xmath88 ) , we did not see the finite conductance deviations at small energy scales @xmath89 predicted recently @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the description of the correlations at the mit .",
    "the first theoretical predictions of spectral correlations at the mit different from those in the metallic regime were given by altshuler _",
    "et al . _",
    "they predicted a purely linear behavior for the spectral rigidity , @xmath90 for @xmath91 , where the constant @xmath92 was estimated to be of the order of @xmath93 , and thus considerably different from the behavior in the insulating regime where @xmath92 is unity .",
    "later , shklovski _ et al .",
    "_  argued that the level statistics at the mit should be completely universal @xcite .",
    "they predicted a level spacing distribution which should be a hybrid between a wigner  dyson type behavior for small @xmath6 , that is @xmath94 for @xmath95 , and a poisson type for @xmath96 : @xmath97 .",
    "then kravtsov _ et al .",
    "_  brought new dynamics into the field by showing that the two - point correlation function @xmath34 has a new long range power - law behavior : instead of varying as @xmath98 like in the wigner - dyson regime , it is predicted to obey@xcite : @xmath99 the non - universal constant @xmath100 depends on the dimension and on the symmetry of the ensemble , and @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 , where @xmath16 is the critical exponent of the localization length @xmath103 .",
    "if one uses the value @xmath104 at the mit @xcite , the exponent @xmath101 is of the order of @xmath105 .",
    "this new power - law behavior can be derived semiclassically from @xmath41 along the same lines as in the metallic regime , but now with anomalous diffusion @xcite .",
    "near the mit , the dimensionless conductance @xmath106 scales with distance @xmath107 like @xmath108 $ ] , where @xmath16 is the exponent of the localization length @xmath109 .",
    "since @xmath27 scales like @xmath110 and @xmath45 like @xmath111 , this implies that the diffusion coefficient has to be size dependent .",
    "for @xmath112 it has to vary as @xmath113\\,.\\ ] ] to this length dependent @xmath114 , one can associate a time dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath115 , @xmath116\\,,\\ ] ]    so that according to eqs .",
    "[ ais ] and [ diff ] , @xmath41 is constant up to a time dependent correction : @xmath117\\,.\\ ] ] the semiclassical expression ( [ ais ] ) is known to be equivalent to the two  diffuson diagrammatic result of altshuler - shklovski @xcite , now with an energy dependent diffusion coefficient .",
    "et al._@xcite argue that at the transition , there are many more diagramms with the same structure so that the correct prefactor of the power law is not known , even in sign .",
    "this structure is supposed to be correct for @xmath118 . by fourier transform , one has the tail of @xmath34 @xmath119    at the transition @xmath120 so that one finds the size independent power law for the tail of the two - point correlation function , eq.[tail ] .",
    "the integration of the power - law tail gives a contribution to the number variance @xmath19 varying as @xmath121 at large energies .",
    "the existence of a linear term in @xmath122 was first ruled out because of a sum rule@xcite  a statement later discussed and contested by aronov and mirlin @xcite .",
    "+ finally , sears and shore @xcite introduced the function @xmath123 , which they computed numerically . with the hypothesis that the scaling behavior of @xmath124 should only depend on the combination of parameters @xmath125 , they were able to reproduce the term @xmath121 in @xmath122 with the same @xmath101 as introduced in @xcite .",
    "however , they indeed found an additional linear term .",
    "their numerical results are in agreement with @xmath126 for a rather large range of disorder and for system sizes up to @xmath127 .",
    "all in all , a consensus now emerges that for @xmath128 , the number variance should contain two terms    @xmath129    although the power law originates directly from the long range behavior of the two - point correlation function , the origin of the linear term is more subtle .",
    "it appears as a constant of integration which is a _",
    "global _ measure of the interaction between eigenvalues integrated over energy .",
    "more precisely , since by definition ( eq.[sigmar ] ) , @xmath34 is the second derivative of @xmath130 , the coefficient @xmath92 of the linear term is simply given by @xmath131 .",
    "the absence of a linear term in @xmath19 in the rmt implies that the `` sum rule '' @xmath132 is fulfilled .",
    "the coefficient @xmath92 contains informations about _ all energy scales _ , in particular low energy scales .",
    "however , until now , most studies concentrated on the long range behavior of @xmath133 .",
    "in the present work , we focus on the _ direct _ calculation of the two - point correlation function and of the form factor both for @xmath134 and @xmath135 . using the method described above , we have calculated @xmath34 for rather small system sizes but using many disorder realizations for @xmath136 . in the energy range we considered ,",
    "finite size effects can be neglected , which we checked by using different sizes . in fig.[f6 ] we show the universal results obtained from systems with different sizes in an energy range @xmath137 . in this small energy range",
    "we used system sizes up to @xmath138 sites and up to 1000 disorder realizations .",
    "obviously , the correlations are weaker than in the goe and qualitatively in agreement with the analytical result of kravtsov and mirlin @xcite which predicts a correction to the small energy slope increasing like @xmath139 when @xmath140 decreases .",
    "the linear variation of @xmath34 at small @xmath6 is consistent with the behavior of @xmath15 at small @xmath6 ( fig.[f7 ] ) .",
    "more precisely @xmath141 .",
    "this means that all the @xmath36 for @xmath142 start at least quadratically for @xmath143 , like in the rmt@xcite .    for practical purpose ,",
    "we have fitted @xmath34 for @xmath144 with @xmath145 the found coefficients @xmath146 and @xmath147 are shown in table [ tab1 ] .",

    "the comparison of the fitted variables for the five different geometries used allows to estimate the remaining statistical error for the exponent to @xmath150 and for the prefactor to @xmath151 ( simple standard deviations , see table [ tab2 ] ) . rather than by statistical errors , the calculation of @xmath34 for even higher energies",
    "is limited by the precision of the unfolding of the spectra : we were able to obtain @xmath152 constant with a precision of about @xmath153 .",
    "for @xmath154 , @xmath34 becomes comparable with this value and thus starts to fluctuate around zero .",
    "this explains the sharp drop in fig.[rslog ] at these energies and might cause a further systematic error for @xmath6 smaller but close to @xmath155 .",
    "we estimate the total error of the exponent to be less than about 20% .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of the sum rule . as we have seen above",

    "it can be written as @xmath156 in the case of the wigner - dyson statistics , the weight @xmath157 , exactly compensates the weight 1 of the @xmath52 function at the origin .",
    "in the case of a poisson statistics , @xmath34 is zero for @xmath158 , so that the @xmath52 function is not compensated and there is a linear term with slope @xmath47 in @xmath122 .",
    "the situation at the mit is intermediate .",
    "we see here that the prefactor is modified by the short range behavior of @xmath34 . inserting the numerical values from the fit , we find that @xmath159 is about @xmath160 for @xmath161 and @xmath162 for @xmath163 .",
    "long range correlations reduce @xmath92 further : _ assuming _ that one can extend the obtained power law for @xmath34 up to much higher energies , one can even estimate @xmath164 for very large energies .",

    "@xmath169 for @xmath170 .",
    "the sum rule seems to be obeyed for energies up to infinity .",
    "this result constradicts the results of refs.@xcite and @xcite who predicted @xmath171 and @xmath172 , respectively .",
    "we finish this study of the two point correlation function by showing in fig.[f5 ] the numerically calculated struture factor @xmath41 as a function of time , including energies up to @xmath173 .",
    "as expected from the above semiclassical argument , it tends to a finite value for small @xmath49 ( but still @xmath49 has to be larger than the collision time ) .",
    "this finite value is related to the slope of @xmath19 for @xmath174 : @xmath175 . in our plot",
    ", @xmath41 seems to converge to the value @xmath176 .",

    ", we can only conclude that a time dependence of the form    @xmath180    is compatible with our data ( @xmath181 ) .    for the same reason as in the metallic case ( self correlation of levels )",

    "for completeness , we briefly comment on the results concerning @xmath15 . shklovski _",
