    "polarized deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) has proven to be an important new tool for studying the structure of the nucleon . through sum rules ,",
    "the experiments have provided us with values of various operator matrix elements ; for instance , the singlet sum rule indicates that quark spin accounts for only a small fraction ( @xmath5 1/3 ) of the nucleon s total spin@xcite .",
    "one possible resolution of this apparently surprising result is that the gluon fields in the nucleon bound state may carry a significant fraction of the nucleon s spin .",
    "orbital angular momentum of quarks and gluons may also be significant .",
    "recently , various authors@xcite have attempted to make estimates of the size of the gluon contribution to the spin of the nucleon , @xmath6 in at least one case@xcite , this quantity was evaluated in low energy models , and turned out to be _ negative_. this is in apparent conflict with extractions , primarily at dis scales , which find @xmath7 positive@xcite . indeed , to leading order ( lo ) in perturbative qcd , @xmath8 is renormalization group invariant , thus the claim has been made that at least the sign of @xmath4 should be a reliable prediction of the models@xcite .",
    "it is well known@xcite that the singlet part of the first moment of the spin structure function @xmath9 has an anomalous @xmath0 evolution .",
    "it is also well known@xcite that the _ leading _ term in @xmath2 in the axial anomalous dimension vanishes , and it is for this reason that many authors dismiss this @xmath0 evolution as insignificant . roughly speaking , corrections to the singlet first moment arising from the anomalous dimension",
    "can be argued to behave like @xmath10 , and hence appear _ approximately _ @xmath0 independent .",
    "this is , however , not precisely true at higher order in @xmath2 . in an earlier",
    "paper,@xcite it was argued that comparing momentum sum rules from unpolarized electroproduction and the spin sum rule for @xmath9 , including their @xmath0 evolution , showed that dis spin measurements are _ consistent _ with a low energy valence quark picture , where the valence quarks carry a substantial part of the spin of the proton . in a later paper,@xcite , those calculations were extended to consistently include the next higher order qcd corrections in leading twist . here",
    ", we will explicitly examine the effects on gluon spin .",
    "we evaluate the leading non - zero qcd corrections to the gluon spin evolution , and find that the sign of the first correction term forces one in the direction of smaller ( more negative ) @xmath3 at lower @xmath0 .",
    "application of these perturbative formulae show that a sign change in @xmath3 thus need not be such a surprise .",
    "there are several caveats to this analysis which must be made at the outset .",
    "first , we apply perturbative formulae down to a regime where they can not rigorously apply ( @xmath11 ) and thus do not expect to have quantitative predictive power . however , the sign change in @xmath4 is significant , and if the perturbative result goes in this direction , there is certainly no reason why the full nonperturbative result might not behave similarly .",
    "furthermore , one can point to the poorly understood successes of the one - gluon exchange mechanism in the hadron mass spectrum@xcite , or of the evolution of unpolarized structure functions@xcite , which provide some faith in at least the qualitative predictions of this method .",
    "the second issue is one of scheme dependence .",
    "the decomposition of the singlet sum into terms involving @xmath12 and @xmath13 depends on renormalization and factorization scheme choice , and is gauge dependent@xcite .",
    "indeed , there is no unique way to define quark and gluon distributions beyond lo .",
    "when in a perturbative qcd regime , we work in the adler - bardeen ( ab ) factorization scheme@xcite , with @xmath14 renormalization conventions , which defines @xmath4 and its contribution to the singlet first moment as well as its @xmath0 evolution to lo .",
    "however , if one wants to work beyond leading order , in particular to evolve to low scales to compare with model predictions , one must know in addition the connection with the choice of scheme ( and thus the underlying operator matrix element definition ) of e.g. @xmath4 in the low energy model calculations .",
    "thus , we really can not make any direct quantitative comparisons with the numerical values extracted in quark model calculations .",
    "we can , nevertheless , unambiguously examine the leading evolution of the gluon spin downwards in q@xmath15 given our choice of scheme , which shows a clear trend towards zero and eventually negative values .",
    "ultimately , one must understand both the renormalization scale and scheme dependence of the quark model calculations in order to decide if the contribution of gluon spin is quantitatively compatible at low and high energy scales .",
    "working at leading twist , the contributions to the hadronic tensors involved in polarized dis , via the operator product expansion , are due to singlet and non - singlet axial currents .",
    "the first moment of the polarized spin structure function @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 are ( non ) singlet coefficient functions calculable in perturbative qcd which have been worked out to second(third ) order in @xmath2@xcite . both are given by @xmath19 to leading order . @xmath20 and @xmath21 are renormalization group invariants , and can be obtained ( modulo issues of flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking@xcite ) from low energy @xmath22-decay constants .    the singlet matrix element is obtained from @xmath23 which in a naive quark model picture is just the total spin of the quarks .",
    "experimental results are generally given for values of @xmath24 with the coefficient function @xmath25 factored out , as shown above , but because of the u(1 ) anomaly in qcd , @xmath26 is itself not scale independent . the qcd evolution of @xmath26 has been worked out to nnlo@xcite , and is given below . for our purposes",
    ", we also wish to consider a decomposition of @xmath26 into separated quark and gluon contributions .",
    "this _ is _ a renormalization scheme - dependent , and gauge dependent , separation .",
    "some authors _ e.g. _ choose a so called gauge - invariant scheme in which the gluons by definition do not contribute to @xmath26@xcite .",
    "in the adler - bardeen factorization scheme@xcite , sometimes called a chirally invariant scheme , the anomalous gluon contribution is explicitly separated out as follows : @xmath27 where f is the number of active flavors at this @xmath0 .",
    "the evolution of the full singlet first moment , @xmath26 , is known to next to leading order ( nlo ) in @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the singlet anomalous dimension , with @xmath30 , and @xmath31 with our choice of renormalization conventions , and @xmath22 is the beta function of qcd , @xmath32 where @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , @xmath35 @xcite . to leading non - zero order , this gives @xmath36 note that the _ difference _ @xmath37 appearing in the formulae above is itself of order @xmath38 , thus naturally the evolution of @xmath26 vanishes at order @xmath2 .",
    "the solution for @xmath26 including nlo corrections in the singlet anomalous dimension and the beta function is @xcite @xmath39 truncated at order @xmath40 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the evolution of @xmath24 is well defined , and is not itself gauge dependent .",
    "it is the _ separation _ of @xmath26 into  spin \" and  gluon \" terms which is scheme and gauge dependent . using the separation choice of eq .",
    "( [ eqa0 ] ) , the evolution of these quantities are given by@xcite @xmath41 to leading order , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the evolution manifestly begins only at second order in @xmath2 .",
    "to leading non - zero order , solving eq .",
    "( [ eqm ] ) directly ( or alternatively , combining eqs .",
    "[ eqa0 ] with [ aeqn ] ) we see @xmath46 of course , to _ first order _ in @xmath2 , the above equation states that @xmath3 is a renormalization group invariant , the usual result .",
    "this last equation already shows qualitatively the results we have claimed ; namely , if @xmath0 is some large scale appropriate to dis , and @xmath47 is some low scale appropriate to a quark model calculation , the leading nonzero correction to @xmath48 is large and positive , and there is no reason the sign need be preserved between low and high @xmath0 scales . in the adler - bardeen scheme , eq .",
    "( [ eqa0 ] ) does not receive higher order corrections@xcite , and one can combine eq .",
    "( [ eqa0 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ aeqnlo ] ) to examine the nlo modifications to @xmath49 .",
    "for definiteness , we use the following experimental values@xcite : @xmath50 , @xmath51 . the evolution equation , ( [ a0ev ] )",
    "evaluated to lo ( nlo ) yields @xmath52 which is a negligible change , well below the present limits of experimental observability . in this sense",
    ", the fact that to leading order there is no @xmath0 evolution is born out . leaving the region of small @xmath2 , however , yields some nontrivial evolution .",
    "as discussed above , the separation of @xmath26 into @xmath12 and @xmath4 requires additional experimental and theoretical assumptions ; recent analyses @xcite consistent with the scheme conventions of this work finds @xmath53 ranging from 0.8 to 2.6 , and thus @xmath54 ranging from 0.2 to 0.75 , and @xmath12 ( which is scale _ independent _ here ) ranging from 0.4 to 0.65 , depending on how the analysis and extraction are done .",
    "the most naive predictions originally gave @xmath55 , but many effective low energy quark models are consistent with a lower value , around @xmath56@xcite .",
    "( the reduction from unity might come _",
    "e.g. _ from the lower components of the relativistic quark spinors , the same source which reduces the axial charge in the bag model from 5/3 ) using any such prediction in eq .",
    "( [ eqa0 ] ) , however , _ assumes a partonic interpretation _ of @xmath57 , which is by no means required by qcd , and may be entirely incorrect@xcite .",
    "starting from the above experimental values , @xmath3 will evolve from somewhere in the range @xmath58 at 5 gev@xmath15 down to zero at a scale where @xmath59 is in the range @xmath60 , _",
    "i.e. _ where nonperturbative physics should just begin to become significant .",
    "going further down in @xmath0 , @xmath2 increases and @xmath61 becomes negative . a smaller assumed value for @xmath62 results in _ less _ rapid downward evolution . in figs",
    "1 - 3 , we show the result of evolving the singlet moment as well as the gluon spin up in @xmath2 ( down in @xmath0 ) . if one applies the nlo corrections of eq .",
    "( [ aeqnlo ] ) to @xmath26 , this makes the evolution slightly _ more _ rapid .",
    "that is , one need not go so far in @xmath59 to get to the  turnover \" point ( @xmath63 , or @xmath64 ) explicitly , @xmath26 reaches 0.5 at @xmath65 using lo evolution for @xmath26 , but @xmath66 using nlo .",
    "it is encouraging that the trend to smaller ( more negative ) @xmath4 at low @xmath0 is enhanced ( rather than cancelled , as it certainly might have been ) by considering the nlo corrections of eq .",
    "( [ aeqnlo ] ) .    moving the other direction",
    ", one can ask how far the trend of increasing @xmath61 with increasing @xmath0 continues . from eq .",
    "( [ aeqn ] ) , as @xmath0 increases , @xmath24 ( slowly ) decreases and this in turn _ reduces _ the rate of change of @xmath3 . in this way , @xmath61 inevitably increases , but assuming that @xmath57 is in the range @xmath67 , eq .",
    "( [ adg ] ) shows that if @xmath3 reaches around @xmath68 , the increase with scale effectively halts , and @xmath69 becomes renormalization group invariant _ beyond _ second order in @xmath2 , as well .    following the logic of refs @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we might argue that evolution of both unpolarized momentum fractions and polarized spin fractions are consistent with a nonrelativistic quark picture at a low energy scale of @xmath70 , where the gluonic contributions vanish .",
    "thus , with @xmath71 , and @xmath72@xcite , we would predict , to leading non - zero order , @xmath73 _ i.e. _ @xmath74 , a result which is certainly compatible with recent high energy experimental estimates@xcite , even though we begin with @xmath75 at the low energy scale .",
    "jaffe provides us with more sophisticated model predictions for @xmath7 at the low energy scale@xcite , namely for the non - relativistic quark model @xmath76 and @xmath77 , while for the bag model @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "his paper makes it clear that these numbers are not to be taken _ too _ seriously , but the sign of @xmath4 is taken as an interesting and surprising result .",
    "however , if we evolve these as above ( bearing in mind the caveats outlined in the introduction ) we would predict @xmath80 , while @xmath81 .",
    "the latter has shown a sign change , with @xmath82 only slightly below the low end of the experimental range . assuming a ( scale independent ) value of @xmath83 , rather than .5 , brings these predictions even higher , e.g. from the bag model result it predicts @xmath84 .",
    "we see that the sign can indeed change , although it depends on both the starting values for @xmath2 and @xmath4 , and thus on the quantitative details of the model .",
    "this is also clear from the evolution shown in figs . 2 and 3 , where the location ( in @xmath2 ) of the sign change is a strong function of the starting values .",
    "we conclude that the sign of @xmath3 at _ low energy _",
    "scales is ill - determined simply based on @xmath85 ( which is leading non - vanishing order ) perturbative qcd arguments , starting from experimental values at moderate @xmath0 .",
    "both lo and nlo perturbative evolution tend to decrease @xmath3 , even to negative values , depending on starting conditions .",
    "the spin content of the glue remains an important aspect of nucleon structure , one whose measurements should certainly be improved at high @xmath0 , and which may play a key role in understanding and interpreting low energy models , but the _ connection _ between the two scales involves nonperturbative physics and is thus not trivial to predict , and one should not be particularly surprised if @xmath69 is found to be negative in a quark model calculation .",
