    "double parton scattering ( dps ) means that two short - distance subprocesses occur in a given hadronic interaction , with two initial partons being active from each of the incident protons in a collision at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the concept is shown for illustrative purposes in fig .  [",
    "fig : feyn - diag ] , and it may be contrasted with conventional single parton scattering ( sps ) in which one short - distance subprocess occurs , with one parton active from each initial hadron .",
    "since the probability of single parton scattering is itself small , it is often expected that the chances are considerably suppressed for two or more short - distance interactions in a given collision .",
    "however , expectations such as these bear quantitative re - examination at the lhc where the high overall center - of - mass energy provides access to very small values of the fractional momentum @xmath2 carried by partons , a region in which parton densities grow rapidly .",
    "a large contribution from double parton scattering could result in a larger than otherwise anticipated rate for multi - jet production and produce significant backgrounds in searches for signals of new phenomena .",
    "the high energy of the lhc also provides an increased dynamic range of available phase space for detailed investigations of dps .     and",
    "@xmath3 from one proton and @xmath4 and @xmath5 from the second proton .",
    "the two hard scattering subprocess are @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "[ fig : feyn - diag ] ]    investigations of double parton scattering have a long history theoretically  @xcite , and there is evidence for their presence in collider data from the cern intersecting storage rings  @xcite and fermilab tevatron  @xcite . a significantly greater role for double - parton processes",
    "may be expected at the lhc where higher luminosities are anticipated along with the higher collision energies .",
    "of substantial importance is to know empirically how large the double parton contribution may be and its dependence on relevant kinematic variables .",
    "our aim is to calculate characteristic final states at lhc energies in which it may be straightforward to discern a double parton signal .",
    "we show in this paper that double parton scattering produces an enhancement of events in regions of phase space in which the `` background '' from single parton scattering is relatively small .",
    "if such enhancements are observed experimentally , with the kinematic dependence we predict , then we will have a direct empirical means to measure the size of the double parton contribution .",
    "in addition to its role in general lhc phenomenology , this measurement will have an impact on the development of partonic models of hadrons , since the effective cross section for double parton scattering measures the size in impact parameter space of the incident hadron s partonic hard core .    from the perspective of sensible rates and experimental tagging ,",
    "a good process to examine should be the 4 parton final state in which there are @xmath8 hadronic jets plus a @xmath9 quark and a @xmath10 antiquark , _ viz . _ @xmath11 .",
    "if the final state arises from double parton scattering , then it is plausible that one subprocess produces the @xmath12 system and another subprocess produces the two jets .",
    "there are , of course , many single parton scattering ( 2 to 4 parton ) subprocesses that can result in the @xmath11 final state , and we look for kinematic distributions that show notable separations of the two contributions .",
    "as we show , the correlations in the final state are predicted to be quite different between the double parton and the single parton subprocesses .",
    "for example , the plane in which the @xmath12 pair resides is uncorrelated with the @xmath13 plane in double parton scattering , but not in the single parton case .",
    "the state - of - the - art of calculations of single parton scattering is well developed whereas the phenomenology of double parton scattering is as yet much less advanced . in the remainder of this introduction ,",
    "we first describe the approach we adopt for the calculation of double parton scattering , specializing to the proton - proton situation of the lhc .",
    "then we outline the paper and summarize our main results .",
    "our calculations are done at leading - order in perturbative qcd , adequate for the points we are trying to make .    making the usual factorization assumption",
    ", we express the single - parton hard - scattering differential cross section for @xmath14 as @xmath15 indices @xmath16 and @xmath4 run over the different parton species in each of the incident protons .",
    "the parton - level subprocess cross sections @xmath17 are functions of the fractional partonic longitudinal momenta @xmath18 and @xmath19 from each of the incident hadrons and of the partonic factorization / renormalization scale @xmath20 .",
    "the parton distribution functions @xmath21 express the probability that parton @xmath16 is found with fractional longitudinal momentum @xmath18 at scale @xmath20 in the proton ; they are integrated over the intrinsic transverse momentum ( equivalently , impact parameter ) carried by the parton in the parent hadron .",
    "a formal theoretical treatment of double parton scattering would begin with a discussion of the hadronic matrix element of four field operators and an explicit operator definition of two - parton correlation functions .",
    "this procedure would lead to a decomposition of the hadronic matrix element into non - perturbative two - parton distribution functions and the corresponding hard partonic cross sections for @xmath22 .",
    "an operator definition of two - parton correlation functions may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite where the two - parton correlation function is reduced to a product of single parton distributions .",
    "an explicit operator definition of two - parton distributions with different values of the two fractional momenta @xmath18 and @xmath23 is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , along with a model for the two - parton distributions in terms of normal parton distributions . in this paper",
    ", we follow a phenomenological approach along lines similar to refs .",
    "@xcite .    in a double parton process ,",
    "partons @xmath16 and @xmath3 are both active in a given incident proton .",
    "we require the joint probability that parton @xmath3 carries fractional momentum @xmath23 , given that parton @xmath16 carries fractional momentum @xmath18 .",
    "in general , this joint probability @xmath24 should also depend on the intrinsic transverse momenta @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the two partons ( or , equivalently , their impact parameters ) .",
    "the hard scales @xmath27 and @xmath28 are characteristic of the two hard subprocesses in which partons @xmath16 and @xmath3 participate . in the sections below , we discuss the choice we make of the hard - scale and do not explore in this paper theoretical uncertainties associated with higher - order perturbative contributions .",
    "in contrast to single parton distributions functions @xmath21 for which global analyses have produced detailed information , very little is known phenomenologically about the magnitude and functional dependences of joint probabilities @xmath24 . a common assumption made in estimates of double parton rates is to ignore possibly strong correlations in longitudinal momentum and to use the approximation @xmath29 for reasons of energy - momentum conservation , if not dynamics , the simple factorized form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : approx1 ] ) can not be true for all values of the fractional momenta @xmath2 .",
    "the values of @xmath23 available to the second interaction are always limited by the values of @xmath18 in the initial interaction since @xmath30 .",
    "the approximation certainly fails even at the kinematic level if both partons carry a substantial fraction of the momentum of the parent hadron .",
    "however , it may be adequate for applications in which the values of @xmath18 and @xmath23 are small .",
    "we remark that the momentum integral @xmath31 as long as we can run the upper limits of the @xmath18 and @xmath23 integrations to @xmath32 , independently .",
    "the large phase space at the lhc may make it possible to explore dynamic correlations that break eq .",
    "( [ eq : approx1 ] ) .    in fig .",

    ", we also account for the possibility of an additional jet which is undetected because it is either too soft or outside of the accepted rapidity range .",

    "having detailed the calculation of the @xmath33 event rates from dps and sps , we now discuss some of the distinguishing characteristics of the two contributions .",

    "by contrast , many diagrams , including some with non - trivial spin correlations , contribute to the 2 parton to 4 parton final state in sps , and naively one would expect some correlation between the two planes . to avoid possible effects from boosting to the lab frame",

    "we use the three - momentum of one of the incoming partons along with the three - momentum of one of the outgoing @xmath9 quarks to define the @xmath55 plane .",
    "let @xmath107 be the three - momentum of an incoming parton , and @xmath108 be the three - momentum of the final - state @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) quark .",

    "note that we use @xmath85 here since the normal to any three - vector and the beam - line will be transverse to the beam - line ( not the case in the sps process ) . in this way",
    ", the jet which is not used to define the plane is guaranteed to lie in the plane .",

    "in sps events , there is a correlation among the planes which is absent for dps events .",

    "we expect the azimuthal angle between the pairs of jets corresponding to each hard scattering event to be strongly peaked near @xmath115 .",
    "real radiation of an additional jet , where the extra jet is missed because it fails the threshold or acceptance cuts , allows smaller values of @xmath116 .",
