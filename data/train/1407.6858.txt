    "high - precision measurements of the deep inelastic scattering data open a possibility for testing new theoretical ideas in a wide kinematic range of @xmath3 and @xmath5 . in the present paper , we report the results of the application of the analytic approach in qcd @xcite , called the analytic perturbation theory ( apt ) , to the qcd analysis of the experimental data on the @xmath2 structure function .",
    "in contrast to the perturbative running coupling which is spoiled by unphysical singularities in the infrared region at a scale @xmath6 , in the framework of the apt , the analytic coupling has no unphysical singularities .",
    "this fact stimulated applications of the apt and its modifications supporting correct analytic properties for various physical processes ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , especially after the generalization of the apt method to the noninteger powers of the running coupling @xcite .",
    "this paper is a continuation of our previous analysis @xcite of the @xmath2 structure function data of the ccfr collaboration @xcite . in the present analysis",
    ", we include in the consideration a set of various experimental @xmath2 data : the cdhs @xcite , scat @xcite , bebc - gargamelle @xcite , bebc - wa59 @xcite , nutev @xcite and chorus @xcite .",
    "note that similar perturbative analysis was performed earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite , but later the new data of the nutev and chorus collaborations were published , and we include these data in the present analysis . in accordance with the result of ref .",

    "the total number of experimental points is 289 and considerably exceeds the number of points considered before in ref .",
    "it allows us to determine parameters of the form of the @xmath2 structure function more precisely .",
    "the kinematic region of a combined set of data is @xmath8 and @xmath9 gev@xmath10 .",
    "thus , in addition to the previous analysis in ref .  @xcite the kinematic region @xmath11 gev@xmath10 is now included .",
    "this region provides a possibility for more precise determination of the parameter @xmath1 and the higher twist ( ht ) contribution . in order to achieve a more direct comparison of the perturbation theory ( pt ) and apt results for fit of a combine set of data",
    ", we do not introduce the normalization factors for the data of an individual collaboration .    in sec .  2",
    ", we present the relevant theoretical expressions required for our analysis . in sec .  3 , we give the qcd fit results in the pt and apt approaches and compare the deviation of the apt results from the pt ones with the experimental uncertainties .",

    "we use the analytic approach in qcd , the apt @xcite .",
    "this approach gives the possibility of combining the renormalization group resummation with correct analytic properties in @xmath5-variable for physical quantities .",

    "@xcite for more details ) , the ordinary pt description violates analytic properties . in the framework of the apt ,",
    "the analytic coupling has no unphysical singularities and in the low-@xmath5 domain , instead of rapidly changing @xmath5 evolution , as occurs in the pt case , the apt approach leads to rather slowly changing functions ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "the apt and pt results coincide .",

    "it should be noted that due to the increased volume of experimental data , in the present analysis the errors for @xmath58 and @xmath59 are some times less than in our previous analysis of ccfr data@xcite in which it was obtained @xmath60 mev and @xmath61  mev .",

    "figure 2 shows the @xmath2-shape obtained in the apt ( solid line ) and the pt ( dotted line ) cases .",
    "one can see that the result for the apt approach is slightly higher than for the pt one for small @xmath3 , and less for large @xmath3 .",
