    "the increase of the lep centre - of - mass energy , @xmath3 , beyond the z pole has extended the range of the accessible physics processes to include a sizable fraction of four - fermion events .",
    "an important part of the four - fermion final states emerges from the pair production of w or z gauge bosons .",
    "the study of z boson pair - production is of interest as it offers a further test of the standard model of the electroweak interactions  @xcite in the neutral gauge boson sector .",
    "moreover , this process constitutes a background in the search of the standard model higgs boson .",
    "in addition , z - pair events allow the investigation of possible triple neutral gauge boson couplings , zzz and zz@xmath4  @xcite , forbidden at tree level in the standard model . these events can also test new theories beyond the standard model such as supersymmetry  @xcite or extra space dimensions  @xcite .    at the lowest order , z pair - production proceeds via two @xmath5-channel feynman diagrams with an internal electron leg . considering",
    "the z decays into fermions , this process is conventionally denoted as nc02 , from the acronym of the neutral - current production mechanism of the four - fermions and the number of diagrams .",
    "a wider definition is used in this letter , encompassing the regions of the full four - fermion phase space compatible with the pair - production of z bosons .",
    "results in the nc02 framework are also given .",
    "the experimental investigation of the z pair - production is made difficult by its rather low cross section , compared with competing two- and four - fermion processes , that constitute large and sometimes irreducible backgrounds .",
    "this process was observed at threshold by the l3 collaboration at @xmath6  @xcite and studied later with a higher statistical sample at @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "results from the other lep collaborations were also reported  @xcite .",
    "this letter describes the extension of the l3 analyses to centre - of - mass energies between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the measurement of the cross section is presented together with other results that include lower centre - of - mass energies .",
    "the measurement of the cross section for the particular case of z pair - production and decay into at least a b quark pair is also discussed .",
    "the data under investigation were collected in 1999 by the l3 detector  @xcite at four different centre - of - mass energies , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 with corresponding integrated luminosities of @xmath12pb@xmath13 , @xmath14pb@xmath13 , @xmath15pb@xmath13 and @xmath16pb@xmath13 .",
    "these energies are denoted as 192 , 196 , 200 and 202 hereafter .",
    "the excalibur  @xcite monte carlo is used to generate events belonging to both the signal and the background neutral - current four - fermion processes .",
    "background from fermion - pair production is described making use of pythia  @xcite and kk2f  @xcite ( @xmath17 ) , koralz  @xcite and kk2f ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) and bhwide  @xcite ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "background from charged - current four - fermion processes is generated with excalibur for @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 and koralw  @xcite for w pair - production and decay in the final states not covered by the simulations listed above .",
    "contributions from multi - peripheral processes are modelled by phojet  @xcite ( @xmath24 ) and diag36@xcite ( @xmath25 ) , in the quark and lepton low invariant mass region not included in the samples generated with excalibur .",
    "the l3 detector response is simulated using the geant program  @xcite , which takes into account the effects of energy loss , multiple scattering and showering in the detector .",
    "time dependent detector inefficiencies , as monitored during the data taking period , are reproduced in these simulations .",
    "the z pair - production signal is defined as the subset of the full four - fermion phase space satisfying the following requirements  @xcite .",
    "first , the invariant mass of both fermion pairs must be between @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in the case",
    "in which fermion pairs can originate from a charged - current process ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with @xmath23 ) , the masses of the fermion pairs which can also emerge from w decays are required to be either below @xmath31 or above @xmath32 .",
    "finally , events with electrons in the final state are rejected if for any electron @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the electron polar angle .",
    "the expected cross sections for the different final states are computed imposing the requirements described above on a sample of events generated with excalibur , and found to be 0.79pb , 0.92pb , 1.00pb and 1.03pb at the four centre - of - mass energies , in increasing order . in this calculation @xmath35",
    "@xcite is included for the qcd vertex corrections .",
    "an uncertainty of @xmath36 is assigned to these predictions , reflecting the differences between them and those obtained with the grc4f  @xcite monte carlo generator as well as the expected accuracy of the treatment of initial state radiation .",
    "the relative populations of the different channels , as obtained from their corresponding cross sections , differ slightly from those of the nc02 framework , derived from the z branching ratios  @xcite .",
    "the cross section for final states with at least one b quark pair is significantly smaller than the total cross section and all centre - of - mass energies are hence combined .",
    "the corresponding predicted cross section is 0.27pb with an uncertainty of @xmath37 .",
    "all the visible final states of the z - pair decay are investigated with criteria similar to those used at @xmath7  @xcite , and modified to follow the evolution of the signal topology , which manifests a larger boost of the z bosons with the higher @xmath3 .",
    "all selections are based on the identification of two fermion pairs , each with a mass close to the z boson mass .",
    "electrons are recognised from energy depositions in the electromagnetic calorimeter whose shower shape is compatible with that initiated by an electron or a photon . according to the selection channel , a track as reconstructed in the central tracker may be required to be associated to this cluster .",
    "muons are reconstructed either from tracks in the muon spectrometer pointing to the interaction vertex and in time with the event , or via only energy depositions in the calorimeters consistent with a minimum ionising particle ( mip ) which have a matching track in the central tracker .              for each of the final states @xmath38",
    ", @xmath39 and @xmath40 , a dedicated selection is performed . a pair of leptons should be present in high multiplicity events with visible energy and effective centre - of - mass energy respectively in excess of 0.5@xmath3 and 0.6@xmath3 .",
    "the effective centre - of - mass energy is the energy at which the @xmath0 interaction takes place after the possible emission of initial state radiation photons .",
    "it is reconstructed taking into account both photons observed in the detector and those collinear with the beam axis  @xcite . for the @xmath38 selection",
    ", at least one electron is required to have a matched track .",
    "no more than one mip is allowed in the @xmath39 selection .",
    "the @xmath40 selection relies on both a particle - based and a jet - based approach .",
    "the former is aimed to identify a pair of taus in the events while in the latter the event is constrained into four - jets .",
    "two of the jets must have less than four tracks and are considered as the tau candidates .",
    "at least one of them has also to coincide with an identified tau .",
    "the radiative @xmath41 background is further suppressed by rejecting events containing a photon of energy larger than @xmath42 .",
    "the topology of the pair - production of z bosons is enforced by requiring the lepton pair and the jet pair to have an opening angle of at least @xmath43 for the electron and muon channels and @xmath44 for the tau channel .",
    "moreover , the invariant mass of the jet - jet and the lepton - lepton systems after performing a kinematic fit , which imposes energy and momentum conservation , must be between @xmath26 and @xmath45 , as depicted in figure  [ fig:1]a for the lepton case .    the contribution from semileptonic decays of w pairs",
    "is reduced by requiring the transverse missing momentum to be lower than @xmath46 and the visible energy in the electron and muon channels to be at least @xmath47 , while it has to be between 0.6@xmath3 and 0.9@xmath3 for the tau selections .    to reject the residual background from w pair - production and hadronic events with gluon radiation , the events are subject to the durham algorithm requiring @xmath48 to be greater than @xmath49 for the electron and muon channels and @xmath50 for the tau channel .",
    "@xmath48 is the durham resolution parameter for which events change from a three - jet into a four - jet topology .",
    "the kinematic fit is repeated on events that pass at least one of the three selections described above , with the additional constraint of equal invariant masses for the jet - jet and lepton - lepton systems .",
    "the distribution of this invariant mass , @xmath51 , is shown in figure  [ fig:1]b .",
    "table  1 summarises the efficiencies achieved by the different selections .",
    "tables  2 and  3 present respectively the total yield of the selection and its breakdown into the different centre - of - mass energies ."
