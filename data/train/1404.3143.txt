    "in recent years an extensive investigation of semiorthogonal decompositions of derived categories of coherent sheaves on algebraic varieties has been done , and now we know quite a lot of examples and some general constructions . with time it is becoming more and more clear that semiorthogonal components of derived categories can be thought of as the main objects in noncommutative algebraic geometry . in this paper i will try to review what is known in this direction  how one can construct semiorthogonal decompositions and how one can use them .    in section  [ sec - sod ] we will recall the basic notions , discuss the most frequently used semiorthogonal decompositions , and state the base change formula . in section  [ sec - hpd ]",
    "we review the theory of homological projective duality which up to now is the most powerful method to construct semiorthogonal decompositions . in section  [ sec - crs ]",
    "we discuss categorical resolutions of singularities , a subject interesting by itself , and at the same time inseparable from homological projective duality . in section",
    "[ sec - ex ] examples of homologically projectively dual varieties are listed .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec - var ] we discuss semiorthogonal decompositions of varieties of small dimension .",
    "i should stress that in the area of algebraic geometry described in this paper there are more questions than answers , but it really looks very promising .",
    "also , due to volume constraints i had to leave out many interesting topics closely related to the main subject , such as the categorical griffiths component , hochschild homology and cohomology , and many others .",
    "this paper can be considered as a continuation and a development of the icm 2002 talk @xcite of alexei bondal and dmitri orlov .",
    "so i will freely use results and definitions from  @xcite and restrict myself to a very short reminder of the most basic notion . in particular , the reader is referred to  @xcite for the definition of a serre functor , fourier  mukai transform , etc .",
    "recall that a semiorthogonal decomposition of a triangulated category @xmath0 is a collection @xmath1 of full triangulated subcategories such that : @xmath2 for all @xmath3 and any objects @xmath4 , @xmath5 one has @xmath6 ; @xmath7 the smallest triangulated subcategory of @xmath0 containing @xmath1 coincides with @xmath0 .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath8 for a semiorthogonal decomposition of  @xmath0 with components @xmath9 ,  , @xmath10",
    ".    we will be mostly interested in semiorthogonal decompositions of @xmath11 , the _ bounded derived category of coherent sheaves _ on an algebraic variety @xmath12 which in most cases will be assumed to be smooth and projective over a base field @xmath13 .",
    "recall that a full triangulated subcategory @xmath14 is admissible if its embedding functor @xmath15 has both left and right adjoint functors @xmath16 .",
    "an admissible subcategory @xmath14 gives rise to a pair of semiorthogonal decompositions    @xmath17    where @xmath18 ) = 0\\ \\text{for all $ a \\in \\ca$ , $ t \\in \\zz$ } \\},\\label{lort}\\\\ \\ca^\\perp : = \\ { t \\in \\ct\\ |\\",

    "more generally , if @xmath20 is a semiorthogonal collection of admissible subcategories in @xmath0 , then for each @xmath21 there is a semiorthogonal decomposition @xmath22    the simplest example of an admissible subcategory is the one generated by an exceptional object . recall that an object @xmath23 is exceptional if @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) = 0 $ ] for @xmath26 .",

    "an exceptional collection in @xmath0 gives rise to a semiorthogonal decomposition @xmath31 here @xmath32 denotes the subcategory generated by the same named exceptional object .",
    "if the category @xmath19 in   is zero the exceptional collection is called full .",
    "there are several well - known and quite useful semiorthogonal decompositions .",
    "the simplest example is the following    there is a full exceptional collection @xmath33    of course , twisting by @xmath34 we get @xmath35 which is also a full exceptional collection for each @xmath30 .    a bit more general is the grassmannian variety :    let @xmath36 be the grassmannian of @xmath37-dimensional subspaces in a vector space of dimension @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath39 be the tautological subbundle of rank @xmath37 . if @xmath40 then there is a semiorthogonal decomposition @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the @xmath43 rectangle , @xmath44 is a young diagram , and @xmath45 is the associated schur functor .",
    "when @xmath46 there is an exceptional collection as well , but it is a bit more complicated , see  @xcite .",
    "another interesting case is the case of a smooth quadric @xmath47 .    when @xmath48 there is a full exceptional collection @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the spinor bundles .",
    "many exceptional collections have been constructed on other rational homogeneous spaces , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "full exceptional collections on smooth toric varieties ( and stacks ) were constructed by kawamata  @xcite .",
    "also exceptional collections were constructed on del pezzo surfaces @xcite , some fano threefolds  @xcite and many other varieties .",
    "let @xmath52 be a scheme and @xmath23 a vector bundle of rank  @xmath53 on it .",

    "an interesting new feature appears for severi ",
    "brauer varieties . recall that a severi ",
    "brauer variety over @xmath52 is a morphism @xmath62 which tale locally is isomorphic to a projectivization of a vector bundle .",
    "brauer variety @xmath12 can be constructed from a torsion element in the brauer group @xmath63 of @xmath52 .",

    "in other words , assume that @xmath88 is a divisor of relative degree @xmath89 in a projectivization of a vector bundle @xmath23 of rank @xmath90 on a scheme @xmath52 corresponding to a line subbundle @xmath91 .",
    "[ thm - qu - sod ] for each @xmath57 there is a fully faithful functor @xmath92 and a semiorthogonal decomposition @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the sheaf of even parts of clifford algebras on @xmath52 associated with the quadric fibration @xmath95 .",
    "the sheaf @xmath94 is a sheaf of @xmath96-algebras which as an @xmath96-module is isomorphic to @xmath97 and equipped with an algebra structure via the clifford multiplication .",
    "if the dimension @xmath38 of fibers of @xmath95 is odd , then @xmath94 is a sheaf of azumaya algebras on the open subset of @xmath52 corresponding to nondegenerate quadrics ( which of course may be empty ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath38 is even then @xmath98 is a central subalgebra in @xmath94 , so the latter gives a sheaf @xmath99 of algebras on the twofold covering @xmath100 of @xmath52 , and @xmath99 is a sheaf of azumaya algebras on the preimage of the open subset of @xmath52 corresponding to nondegenerate quadrics .      a triangulated category @xmath0 is @xmath52-linear if it is equipped with a module structure over the tensor triangulated category @xmath101 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath12 is a scheme over @xmath52 and @xmath62 is the structure morphism then a semiorthogonal decomposition @xmath102 is @xmath52-linear if each of the subcategories @xmath103 is closed under tensoring with an object of @xmath101 , i.e.  for @xmath104 and @xmath105 one has @xmath106 .    the semiorthogonal decompositions of theorems  [ thmorlsod ] ,",

    "there are several questions which might be crucial for further investigations .",
    "find a good condition for an exceptional collection to be full .",
    "one might hope that if the collection generates the grothendieck group ( or the hochschild homology ) of the category then it is full .",
    "however , recent examples of quasiphantom and phantom categories ( see section  [ ssec - surfaces ] ) show that this is not the case . still we may hope that in the categories generated by exceptional collections there are no phantoms .",
    "in other words one could hope that the following is true .",
    "let @xmath115 be a triangulated category generated by an exceptional collection",
    ". then any exceptional collection of length @xmath38 in @xmath0 is full .",
    "if there is an action of a group @xmath116 on an algebraic variety @xmath12 , one can consider the equivariant derived category @xmath117 along with the usual derived category .",
    "in many interesting cases ( flag varieties , toric varieties , git quotients ) it is quite easy to construct a full exceptional collection in the equivariant category .",
    "it would be extremely useful to find a way to transform it into a full exceptional collection in the usual category . in some sense",
    "the results of  @xcite can be considered as an example of such an approach .",
    "another very important question is to find possible restrictions for existence of semiorthogonal decompositions .",
    "up to now there are only several cases when we can _ prove _ indecomposability of a category .",
    "the first is the derived category of a curve of positive genus .",
    "the proof ( see e.g.  @xcite ) is based on special properties of categories of homological dimension  1 .",
    "another is the derived category of a calabi ",
    "yau variety ( smooth connected variety with trivial canonical class ) .",
    "its indecomposability is proved by a surprisingly simple argument due to bridgeland  @xcite .",
    "this was further generalized in  @xcite to varieties with globally generated canonical class .",
    "on the other hand , the original argument of bridgeland generalizes to any connected calabi ",

    "so , we will call them simply lefschetz decompositions .",

    "then the hp dual lefschetz decomposition is also rectangular , has the same components @xmath193 and @xmath194 ( in particular in a picture analogous to the above the gray and the white parts are rectangles , which explains the name `` rectangular '' ) .",
    "moreover , in this case for any @xmath195 one has either @xmath196 or @xmath197 , hence in decompositions   and   either the first or the second category has only one component @xmath170 and nothing else .",
    "then the other decomposition shows that the nontrivial component of the derived category of a linear section is equivalent to the derived category of the orthogonal linear section of the dual variety .",
    "in general , the hp dual category @xmath150 defined by   need not be equivalent to @xmath164 for an algebraic variety @xmath76 .",
    "in fact , only a few such cases are known  the linear duality , the duality for quadrics , the duality for grassmannians @xmath198 and @xmath199 , and the spinor variety @xmath200 ( see section  [ sec - ex ] ) .",
    "one can get many additional interesting examples by allowing @xmath76 to be a noncommutative variety . here",
    "a noncommutative variety can be understood in different ways . if one uses the most general sense",
    " as a semiorthogonal component of the derived category of an algebraic variety  then tautologically the hp dual category @xmath146 itself will provide a noncommutative hp dual variety .",
    "in fact , one can develop a theory of hp duality for noncommutative varieties in this sense and prove the same results ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "however , in this most general form the semiorthogonal decompositions provided by the hp duality theorem will not have an apparent geometric interpretation .",
    "in fact , an interesting geometry arises in hp duality if the dual variety @xmath76 is close to a commutative variety .",
    "for example , it often happens that there is a ( commutative ) algebraic variety @xmath201 with a map @xmath202 , a sheaf of finite @xmath203-algebras @xmath204 on @xmath201 whose bounded derived category @xmath205 of coherent @xmath204-modules on @xmath201 is equivalent to the hp dual category @xmath146 of @xmath12 and such that the equivalence @xmath206 is given by an appropriate object @xmath207 .",
    "of course , one can easily allow here the variety @xmath12 also to be noncommutative in the same sense .",
    "it is easy to modify all the definitions accordingly .    in section  [ sec - ex ]",
    "we discuss examples showing that this generalization is meaningful . among such examples",
    "are the veronese ",
    "clifford duality , the grassmannian ",
    "pfaffian duality , and their generalizations .    in fact ,",
    "in some of these examples , the hp duality theorem  [ thmhpd ] still gives semiorthogonal decompositions for usual commutative varieties ( even though the dual variety is noncommutative ) .",
    "indeed , the sheaf of algebras @xmath204 on @xmath201 is frequently isomorphic to a matrix algebra on an open subset of @xmath201 , typically , on its smooth locus  in fact , in these cases the noncommutative variety @xmath208 can be thought of as a categorical resolution of singularities of @xmath76 . in this situation ,",
    "taking a subspace @xmath152 such that @xmath209 is contained in that open subset , one gets @xmath210 .",
    "as it was explained above ( and we will see in some of the examples below ) in many cases the hp dual variety looks as a noncommutative ( or categorical ) resolution of singularities of a singular variety .",
    "so , a good notion of a categorical resolution is necessary for the theory .",
    "if @xmath211 is a resolution of singularities , we have an adjoint pair of triangulated functors @xmath212 and @xmath213 ( here @xmath214 stands for the category of perfect complexes on @xmath76 ) .",
    "we axiomatize this situation in the following    [ defcrs ] a categorical resolution of singularities of a scheme @xmath76 is a smooth triangulated category @xmath0 and an adjoint pair of triangulated functors @xmath215 and @xmath216 such that @xmath217 .",
    "in particular , the functor @xmath218 is fully faithful .",
    "we will not discuss the notion of smoothness for a triangulated category .",
    "in fact , for our purposes it is always enough to assume that @xmath0 is an admissible @xmath76-linear subcategory of @xmath219 for a geometric resolution @xmath220 .",
    "let @xmath221 and @xmath222 be two categorical resolutions of @xmath76 .",
    "we will say that @xmath0 dominates @xmath223 if there is a fully faithful functor @xmath224 such that @xmath225 .",
    "clearly , this is compatible with the usual dominance relation between geometric resolutions  if a resolution @xmath211 factors as @xmath226 then the functor @xmath227 is fully faithful and @xmath228    categorical resolutions have two advantages in comparison with geometric ones .",
    "first , if @xmath76 has irrational singularities the pullback functor for a geometric resolution is never fully faithful and so its derived category is not a categorical resolution in sense of definition  [ defcrs ] .",
    "however , it was shown in  @xcite that any separated scheme of finite type ( even nonreduced ) over a field of zero characteristic admits a categorical resolution .",
    "the second advantage is that the dominance order for categorical resolutions is more flexible .",
    "for example , in many examples one can find a categorical resolution which is much smaller than any geometric resolution .",
    "there are strong indications that the minimal model program on the categorical level may be much simpler than the classical one .",

    "all exceptional objects have been classified @xcite , and moreover , three - blocks exceptional collections were constructed @xcite , but the complete picture is not known .      for surfaces of kodaira dimension 0 it is well known that there are no nontrivial semiorthogonal decompositions for k3 and abelian surfaces . for enriques surfaces",
    "there may be an exceptional collection of line bundles of length up to 10 ( see  @xcite ) , and for so - called nodal enriques surfaces the complementary component is related to the artin ",
    "mumford quartic double solid @xcite .",
    "for bielliptic surfaces nothing is known .    for surfaces of kodaira dimension 1 with",
    "globally generated canonical class ( and even for those without multiple fibers and @xmath446 ) there are no semiorthogonal decompositions by  @xcite . for others nothing is known as well .",
    "finally , for surfaces of general type there is an unexpectedly rich theory of semiorthogonal decompositions .",
    "in fact , for many surfaces of general type with @xmath447 ( the classical godeaux surface , the beauville surface , the burniat surfaces , the determinantal barlow surface , some fake projective planes ) exceptional collections of length equal to the rank of the grothendieck group have been constructed in @xcite .",
    "the collections , however , are not full .",
    "the complementary components have finite ( or even zero ) grothendieck group and trivial hochschild homology and by that reason they are called quasiphantom or phantom categories .",
    "the phantoms can not be detected by additive invariants , but one can use hochschild cohomology instead , see  @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature here is that the structure of the constructed exceptional collections resembles very much the structure of exceptional collections of del pezzo surfaces with the same @xmath448 .",
    "the only ( but a very important ) difference is that whenever there is a @xmath449-space between exceptional bundles on del pezzo , the corresponding exceptional bundles on the surface of general type have @xmath450-space .",
    "this seemingly small difference , however , has a very strong effect on the properties of the category .",
    "see more details in _ loc .",
    "_      for derived categories of threefolds ( and higher dimensional varieties ) there are no classification results ( as there is no classification of threefolds ) . of course ,",
    "as it already was mentioned for varieties with trivial ( or globally generated ) canonical class there are no nontrivial decompositions .",
    "so , from now on we will discuss fano varieties .    in dimension 3",
    "all fano varieties were classified in the works of fano , iskovskikh and mukai .",
    "all fano 3-folds with picard number greater than 1 are either the blowups of other fano varieties with centers in points and smooth curves ( and then their derived category reduces to the derived category of a fano 3-fold with smaller picard number ) , or conic bundles over rational surfaces ( see tables 12.312.6 of  @xcite ) . for conic bundles one can use the quadratic bundle formula ( theorem  [ thm - qu - sod ] ) .",
    "it gives a semiorthogonal decomposition with several exceptional objects and the derived category of sheaves of modules over the even part of the clifford algebra on the base of the bundle .",
    "if the picard number is 1 , the next discrete invariant of a fano 3-fold to look at is the index , i.e.  the maximal integer dividing the canonical class . by fujita s theorem the only fano 3-folds of index greater than 2 are @xmath451 and @xmath452 .",
    "their derived categories are well understood , so let us turn to 3-folds of index 2 and 1 .    for a fano 3-fold @xmath76 of index 2 the pair of line bundles",
    "@xmath453 is exceptional and gives rise to a semiorthogonal decomposition @xmath454 the component @xmath455 is called the nontrivial component of @xmath164 .",
    "a similar decomposition can be found for a fano 3-fold @xmath12 of index 1 and degree @xmath456 which is not divisible by 4 ( the degree of a 3-fold of index 1 is always even ) . by a result of mukai  @xcite on such @xmath12 there is an exceptional vector bundle @xmath457 of rank @xmath89 with @xmath458 , which is moreover orthogonal to the structure sheaf of  @xmath12 . in other words",
    ", @xmath459 is an exceptional pair and there is a semiorthogonal decomposition @xmath460 the component @xmath461 is called the nontrivial component of @xmath11 .",
    "it is rather unexpected that the nontrivial parts @xmath455 and @xmath461 for a fano 3-fold @xmath76 of index @xmath89 and degree @xmath462 and for a fano 3-fold @xmath12 of index 1 and degree @xmath463 have the same numerical characteristics , and are , moreover , expected to belong to the same deformation family of categories .",
    "in fact , this expectation is supported by the following result .",
    "recall that the degree of a fano 3-fold of index 2 with picard number 1 satisfies @xmath464 , while the degree of a fano 3-fold of index 1 with picard number 1 is even and satisfies @xmath465 , @xmath466 .",
    "so there are actually 5 cases to consider .",
    "see _ loc .",
    "_ for a precise statement .",
    "in fact , for @xmath470 the category is rigid and is equivalent to the derived category of representations of the quiver with 2 vertices and 3 arrows from the first vertex to the second ( this follows from the construction of explicit exceptional collections in the derived categories of @xmath471 and @xmath472 , see  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "further , for @xmath473 each of the categories @xmath474 and @xmath475 is equivalent to the derived category of a curve of genus 2 , and moreover , each smooth curve appears in both pictures .",
    "this follows from hp duality for the double veronese embedding of @xmath476 and from hp duality for @xmath402 grassmannian respectively @xcite .",
    "finally , for @xmath477 no independent description of the category in question is known , but the hp duality for the grassmannian @xmath478 gives the desired equivalence ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out , however , that already for @xmath479 the situation is more subtle .",
    "it seems that in that case the categories @xmath480 lie at the boundary of the family of categories @xmath481 . and",
    "for @xmath482 the situation is completely unclear .",
    "the situation with fano 3-folds of index 1 and degree divisible by  4 is somewhat different . for such threefolds",
    "it is , in general , not clear how one can construct an exceptional pair .",
    "however , for @xmath483 and @xmath484 this is possible . for @xmath483 mukai",
    "has proved  @xcite that there is an exceptional pair @xmath485 where @xmath486 is a rank 5 exceptional bundle with @xmath487 .",
    "using hp duality for the spinor variety  @xmath200 one can check that this pair extends to a semiorthogonal decomposition @xmath488 where @xmath489 is a smooth curve of genus @xmath490 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "analogously , for @xmath484 mukai has constructed  @xcite an exceptional bundle @xmath491 of rank @xmath492 with @xmath493 .",
    "using hp duality for @xmath494 one can check that there is a semiorthogonal decomposition @xmath495 where @xmath496 is a smooth curve of genus @xmath492 @xcite .",
    "maybe one of the most interesting 4-folds is the cubic 4-fold .",
    "one of its salient features is the hyperkhler structure on the fano scheme of lines , which turns out to be a deformation of the second hilbert scheme of a k3 surface .",
    "this phenomenon has a nice explanation from the derived categories point of view .",
    "let @xmath497 be a cubic @xmath498-fold .",
    "then there is a semiorthogonal decomposition @xmath499 and its nontrivial component @xmath500 is a calabi  yau category of dimension @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , @xmath500 is equivalent to the derived category of coherent sheaves on a k@xmath492 surface , at least if @xmath76 is a pfaffian cubic @xmath498-fold , or if @xmath76 contains a plane @xmath501 and a @xmath89-cycle @xmath502 such that @xmath503 .    to establish this result for pfaffian cubics one can use hp duality for @xmath478 .",
    "the associated k3 is then a linear section of this grassmannian . for cubics with a plane a quadratic bundle formula for the projection of @xmath76 from the plane @xmath501",
    "gives the result .",
    "the k3 surface then is the double covering of @xmath412 ramified in a sextic curve , and the cycle @xmath502 gives a splitting of the requisite azumaya algebra on this  k3 .    for generic @xmath76 the category @xmath500",
    "can be thought of as the derived category of coherent sheaves on a noncommutative k3 surface .",
    "therefore , any smooth moduli space of objects in @xmath500 should be hyperkhler , and the fano scheme of lines can be realized in this way , see  @xcite .",
    "the fact that a cubic 4-fold has something in common with a k3 surface can be easily seen from its hodge diamond .",
    "in fact , the hodge diamond of @xmath76 is @xmath504 and one sees immediately the hodge diamond of a k3 surface in the primitive part of the cohomology of @xmath76 .",
    "there are some other 4-dimensional fano varieties with a similar hodge diamond .",
    "the simplest example is the 4-fold of degree 10 in @xmath199 ( an intersection of @xmath199 with a hyperplane and a quadric in @xmath505 ) .",
    "its hodge diamond is @xmath506 and again its primitive part has k3 type . on a categorical level this follows from the following result    [ cycat ] let @xmath12 be a smooth projective variety of index @xmath264 with a rectangular lefschetz decomposition @xmath507 of length @xmath264 .",
    "let @xmath508 be the smooth zero locus of a global section of the line bundle @xmath509 for @xmath510 .",
    "then there is a semiorthogonal decomposition @xmath511 and moreover , a power of the serre functor @xmath512 is isomorphic to a shift @xmath513 , \\qquad \\text{where $ c = \\gcd(d , m)$}.\\ ] ] in particular , if @xmath514 divides @xmath264 then @xmath515 is a calabi  yau category of dimension @xmath516 .",
    "analogously , one can consider a double covering @xmath517 ramified in a zero locus of a global section of the line bundle @xmath518 instead .",
    "then there is an analogous semiorthogonal decomposition and the serre functor has the property @xmath519,\\ ] ] where @xmath520 is the involution of the double covering .    applying this result to a 4-fold @xmath76 of degree 10 one",
    "constructs a semiorthogonal decomposition @xmath521 with @xmath522 being the restriction of the tautological bundle from the grassmannian @xmath199 and @xmath500 a calabi  yau category of dimension @xmath89 .",
    "again , for some special @xmath76 one can check that @xmath500 is equivalent to the derived category of a k3 surface and so altogether we get another family of noncommutative k3 categories",
    ". moreover , in this case one can also construct a hyperkhler fourfold from @xmath76 .",
    "one of the ways is to consider the fano scheme of conics on @xmath76 , see  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that it comes with a morphism to @xmath476 with the image being a singular sextic hypersurface , and the stein factorization of this map gives a genus zero fibration over the double covering of the sextic , known as a double epw sextic .",
    "this is a hyperkhler variety , deformation equivalent to the second hilbert square of a k3 surface .",
    "finally , there is yet another interesting example .",
    "namely , consider a hyperplane section @xmath76 of a 5-fold @xmath12 , which is the zero locus of a global section of the vector bundle @xmath523 on @xmath524 with @xmath307 of dimension 7 .",
    "this variety @xmath76 was found by kchle in @xcite ( variety @xmath525 in his table ) , and its hodge diamond is as follows @xmath526    the 5-dimensional variety @xmath527 has a rectangular lefschetz decomposition @xmath528 with @xmath529 generated by @xmath530 exceptional objects .",
    "consequently , its hyperplane section @xmath76 has a semiorthogonal decomposition @xmath531 with @xmath500 being a k@xmath492 type category .",
    "it would be very interesting to understand the geometry of this variety and to find out , whether there is a hyperkhler variety associated to it , analogous to the fano scheme of lines on a cubic fourfold and the double epw sextic associated to the 4-fold of degree 10 .",
    "a natural candidate is the moduli space of twisted cubic curves .",
