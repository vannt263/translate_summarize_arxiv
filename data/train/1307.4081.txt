    "we find that :    1- wfc3/ir medium filters are very efficient in classifying agb stars into their o- and c - rich subtypes , which is important for extending c star searches in galaxies outside of the local group where resolution and sensitivity prevent ground - based nir imaging .",
    "2- these filters also place o - rich m stars along a sequence of increasing water absorption , with the potential of providing information about the  distribution of these stars . given the proximity between the f127 m and f153 m filters , this classification is largely unaffected by star - to - star variations in the reddening .",
    "3- contrary to previous work , our observations reveal the nearly - absence of c stars in this inner disk region of m31 . with a sample of 3032 tp - agb stars , we find @xmath86@xmath1@xmath2 , 12 orders of magnitude lower than previous c star searches in m31 .",

    "<S> we use medium - band near - infrared ( nir ) _ hubble space telescope _ wfc3 photometry with model nir spectra of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars to develop a new tool for efficiently distinguishing carbon - rich ( c - type ) agb stars from oxygen - rich ( m - type ) agb stars in galaxies at the edge of and outside the local group . </S>",
    "<S> we present the results of a test of this method on a region of the inner disk of m31 , where we find a surprising lack of c stars , contrary to the findings of previous c star searches in other regions of m31 . </S>",
    "<S> we find only 1 candidate c star ( plus up to 6 additional , less certain c stars candidates ) , resulting in an extremely low ratio of c to m stars ( @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 ) that is 12 orders of magnitude lower than other c / m estimates in m31 . </S>",
    "<S> the low c / m ratio is likely due to the high metallicity in this region which impedes stars from achieving @xmath3 in their atmospheres . </S>",
    "<S> these observations provide stringent constraints to evolutionary models of metal - rich agb stars and suggest that there is a metallicity threshold above which m stars are unable to make the transition to c stars , dramatically affecting agb mass loss and dust production and , consequently , the observed global properties of metal - rich galaxies . </S>"
