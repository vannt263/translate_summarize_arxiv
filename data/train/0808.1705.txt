    "the @xmath1 meson plays a key role in the experimental search for the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in heavy - ion collision experiments where an anomalous suppression of its production cross section relative to the drell - yan continuum as a function of the centrality of the collision has been found by the cern - na50 collaboration @xcite . an effect like this has been predicted to signal qgp formation @xcite as a consequence of the screening of color charges in a plasma in close analogy to the mott effect ( metal - insulator transition ) in dense electronic systems @xcite .",
    "however , a necessary condition to explain @xmath1 suppression in the static screening model is that a sufficiently large fraction of @xmath3 pairs after their creation have to traverse regions of qgp where the temperature ( resp .",
    "parton density ) has to exceed the mott temperature @xmath4 @xcite for a sufficiently long time interval @xmath5 , where @xmath6 mev is the critical phase transition temperature and @xmath7 fm / c is the @xmath1 formation time . within an alternative scenario @xcite , @xmath1 suppression",
    "does not require temperatures well above the deconfinement one but can occur already at @xmath8 due to impact collisions by quarks from the thermal medium .",
    "an important ingredient for this scenario is the lowering of the reaction threshold for string - flip processes which lead to open - charm meson formation and thus to @xmath1 suppression .",
    "this process has an analogue in the hadronic world , where e.g. j/@xmath9 could occur provided the reaction threshold of @xmath10 mev can be overcome by pion impact .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this process and its in - medium modification can play a key role in the understanding of anomalous @xmath1 suppression as a deconfinement signal .",
    "since at the deconfinement transition the @xmath11- mesons enter the continuum of unbound ( but strongly correlated ) quark- antiquark states ( mott- effect ) , their spectral function is broadened and the relevant threshold for charmonium breakup is effectively lowered so that the reaction rate for the process gets critically enhanced @xcite .",
    "thus a process which is almost negligible in the vacuum may give rise to additional ( and therefore anomalous ) @xmath1 suppression when conditions of the chiral/ deconfinement transition and @xmath11- meson mott effect are reached in a heavy - ion collision .",
    "the dissociation of the @xmath1 itself still needs impact to overcome the threshold which is still present but dramatically reduced .    for this alternative scenario @xcite to work the @xmath1 breakup cross section by meson impact",
    "is required and its dependence on the masses of the final state @xmath11- mesons has to be determined .",
    "after the first calculations of this quantity within a nonrelativistic potential model ( npm ) @xcite and its systematic improvement @xcite , the relativistic quark model ( rqm ) calculation suggested in @xcite could recently be completed for @xmath1 dissociation processes by pion impact @xcite .",
    "both approaches result in energy dependent cross sections with a steep rise to a maximum of the order of @xmath12 mb close to the threshold followed by a fast drop .",
    "this agreement in shape and magnitude is a nontrivial result since the npm contains quark and gluon exchange diagrams only at first born order whereas the rqm includes meson exchange diagrams between the colliding mesons , which correspond to ladder - type resummation of gluon exchanges .    shortly after the publication of the npm results , a chiral lagrangian ( cl ) approach to the problem of @xmath1 dissociation",
    "has been suggested @xcite which resulted in qualitatively different predictions for the magnitude and the energy dependence of the dissociation cross sections : a monotonously rising behaviour which reached the level of @xmath12 mb only about 400 mev above the threshold . in this work , however , important processes have not been considered and subsequent , more systematic developments of the cl approach @xcite have revealed the importance of @xmath13 meson exchange and contact diagrams . their inclusion lead to a steep rise of the cross section at the threshold to a level of several tens of millibarns followed by a continuous rise with increasing energy",
    ". it has been admitted , however , that this monotonously rising behaviour of the cross section is an artifact of the treatment of mesons as pointlike particles in the cl approach .",
    "phenomenological formfactors have therefore been introduced in order to take into account the finite size of meson - meson vertices due to the composite nature of the mesons .",
    "unfortunately , the results of the formfactor - improved cl models ( fclm ) appear to be strongly dependent on the choice of those formfactors for the meson - meson vertices @xcite .",
    "this is a basic flaw of these approaches which could only be overcome when a more fundamental approach , e.g. , from a quark model , can determine these input quantities of the chiral lagrangian approach .",
    "there have been attempts to reduce the uncertainties of the fclm by constraining the choice of the formfactor using a comparison with results of the npm approach which makes use of meson wave functions @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we suggest a formfactor model which takes into account the different sizes of mesons in the collision by meson - dependent range parameters and accounts for the fact that in a rqm the contact diagrams are represented by a quark loop containing four mesonic wave functions ( box diagram ) which suppress the transition amplitude at high momentum transfer , while meson exchange diagrams are represented by the product of triangle diagrams containing six meson wave functions .",
    "we calibrate the parameters of this meson formfactor model by comparison with a rqm calculation of the @xmath1 dissociation by pion impact @xcite . on the basis of this newly developed meson formfactor cl ( mfcl ) model we make a prediction for the rho - meson impact dissociation processes of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "we suggest that this mfcl model can be applied for the calculation of the in - medium modification of the @xmath1 breakup due to the mott - effect for mesonic states at the deconfinement / chiral restoration transition according to the quantum kinetic approach suggested in @xcite and provide an explanation of the anomalous @xmath1 suppression effect observed in heavy - ion collisions at the cern - sps @xcite .",
    "the mfcl approach developed here can be applied also to @xmath1 dissociation by nucleon impact which is of central importance for the quark matter diagnostics under dense nuclear matter conditions as , e.g. , in the planned cbm experiment at fair darmstadt or at nica dubna .",
    "the effective lagrangian approach we employ in the present study is developed in ref .",
    "@xcite based on the minimal @xmath0 yang - mills lagrangian including anomalous parity interactions which are connected to the gauged wess - zumino action , namely @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the processes we discuss in the following on this basis are thus @xmath18 the corresponding cross sections after averaging ( summing ) over initial ( final ) spins and including isospin factors can be represented in a form given by    @xmath19    where the @xmath20 are the standard mandelstam variables , @xmath21[s-(m_1-m_2)^2]}{4s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the squared momentum of initial state mesons in the center - of - momentum frame . in eq .",
    "( [ cross ] ) we have introduced the projectors @xmath22 corresponding to each involved vector particle of species @xmath23 and their relationship to the polarisation vectors @xmath24 employed , e.g. , in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this notation makes explicit that each amplitude contributing to the differential cross section ( [ cross ] ) is manifestly gauge invariant @xmath25 .",

    "the results for the energy dependent cross sections of the @xmath1 breakup processes by pion and rho - meson impact are shown in fig .",
    "the unknown coupling constants of the chiral lagrangian approach are fixed according to the scheme given in ref .",
    "@xcite which is based on the @xmath0 symmetry relations , the vector dominance model and the observed decay @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting values of @xcite are given in the table of appendix [ constants ] .    as it has been discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the monotonous rise of the cross section with increasing energy has to be considered as an unphysical artifact of the neglect of the finite size of the mesons due to their quark substructure . in the following section we suggest a new scheme for introducing hadronic formfactors which is based on the insight from the npm ( rqm ) that they originate from the meson wavefunctions ( bethe - salpeter amplitudes ) involved in the representation of the meson vertices by quark exchange ( quark loop ) diagrams .",
    "the chiral lagrangian aproach for @xmath1 breakup by light meson impact makes the assumption that mesons and meson - meson interaction vertices are pointlike ( four - momentum independent ) objects .",
    "this neglect of the finite extension of mesons as quark - antiquark bound states has dramatic consequences : it leads to a monotonously rising behaviour of the cross sections for the corresponding processes , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "this result , however , can not be correct away from the reaction threshold where the tails of the mesonic wave functions determine the high - energy behaviour of the quark exchange ( in the nonrelativistic formulation of @xcite ) or quark loop ( in the relativistic formulation @xcite ) diagrams describing the microscopic processes underlying the @xmath1 breakup by meson impact . since the mesonic wave functions describing quark - antiquark bound states have a finite extension in coordinate- and momentum space , the @xmath1 breakup cross section is expected to be decreasing function for high c.m .",
    "energies of the collision .",
    "such a behaviour has been obtained within npm and rqm approaches to meson - meson interactions @xcite . in order to model such a behaviour within chiral meson lagrangian",
    "approaches one uses formfactors at the interaction vertices @xcite which can be calibrated using quark model results for available processes . on this basis",
    "the cross sections for otherwise unknown processes can be predicted . when the amplitudes of all subprocesses are separately gauge invariant ( see the discussion of eqs .",
    "( [ cross ] ) and ( [ project ] ) in sect .",
    "[ sec : cross ] ) , the procedure of their rescaling with different three - momentum dependent formfactors does not violate the gauge invariance of the chiral lagrangian approach .",
    "however , the violation of the transversality requirement by assuming different formfactors for processes ( which are not separately transveral as motivated for example by the relativistic quark model ) should not be mismatched with a possible violation of the conservation laws by the considered processes . due to the implementation of phenomenological formfactors",
    "our approach qualifies as an effective one for which conservation laws are fulfilled by the construction of the amplitudes for interaction vertices .",
    "the simplest ansatz for a hadronic formfactor disregards the specifics of different mesonic species such as the different radii of their wave functions . following the definitions of ref .",
