    "for many decades it has been known that hydrogen - rich type ii supernovae ( sne ; minkowski 1941 ; see filippenko 1997 for a review on sn spectroscopic classification ) arise from the gravitational core - collapse of massive stars ( e.g. , arnett et al .",
    "1989 ; smartt 2009 ) .",
    "schlegel ( 1990 ) recognized that a small subset of sne ii show narrow emission lines , and proposed that they constituted a separate subclass ( sne iin ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the narrow emission lines of sn  iin originate from photoionized dense wind surrounding the exploding stars ( chugai 1991 ) .",
    "it was later noticed that some sne iin ( e.g. , sn 1988z ) show , in addition to a narrow unresolved h@xmath7 emission component ( @xmath8kms@xmath1 ) also an intermediate component ( @xmath9kms@xmath1 ; stathakis & sadler 1991 ) .",
    "this component has been interpreted as a result of radiative shocks in dense wind clouds ( chugai & danziger 1994 ) , though other explanations have been suggested ( chugai 2001 ; dessart et al .",
    "2009 ) .    over the years",
    ", a specific model has emerged , which describes the properties of sne iin as a result from a combination of emission from several physically distinct regions ( see smith et al .",
    "2008 for a recent description ) . in brief",
    ", it is assumed that the sn ejecta interact with a massive slower wind blown by the progenitor star , launching a pair of forward and reverse shocks .",
    "the blast wave is decelerated by the interaction from its initial velocity , and a dense shell traveling approximately at the shock velocity is formed .",
    "initially , this dense shell is optically thick , and obscures the actual electron - scattering photosphere of the supernova which lies interior to the shock . at this stage ( which can , in principle , have a duration of years )",
    ", the optical spectrum is dominated by a blue continuum from the shocked material , superposed with emission lines .",
    "the emission lines often have a complex profile , including a narrow component from the photoionized , outer unshocked wind , and an intermediate - width component from the shocked dense shell . later on ,",
    "as the interaction weakens , the shocked region may become optically thin and the underlying supernova photosphere ( with its high - velocity absorption - dominated spectrum ) may emerge ( e.g. , gal - yam & leonard 2009 ) . applying such a model , one can extract the physical properties of the progenitor star ( in particular , its mass - loss rate ) from the observations ( e.g. , salamanca et al .",
    "1998 , gal - yam & leonard 2009 ) .",
    "previously derived values ( summarized in table  [ oldsniintable ] ) show progenitor wind velocities of @xmath10kms@xmath1 and mass loss rates that range between @xmath11m@xmath6y@xmath1 .",
    "these are consistent with a variety of possible massive progenitors , from red supergiant stars ( rsgs ; typical wind velocities of tens of kms@xmath1 , e.g. , smith et al . 2007 ) and small mass - loss rates ( @xmath12m@xmath6y@xmath1 ) , to stripped wolf - rayet ( w - r ) stars with fast ( thousands of kms@xmath1 ) and more massive winds ( @xmath13m@xmath6y@xmath1 ) , up to luminous blue variable stars ( lbvs ) which have the most extreme mass - loss rates ( up to @xmath14m@xmath6y@xmath1 ) and intermediate - velocity winds ( a few hundreds of kms@xmath1 ; e.g. , humphreys & davidson 1994 ) .",
    "the connection between sne iin and lbvs was brought into focus by studies of sn 2005gl .",
    "gal - yam et al .",
    "( 2007a ) analyzed pre - explosion images of this sn iin , and detected a possible progenitor , whose extreme luminosity ( l@xmath15l@xmath6 ) suggested an lbv identification ( the only stars of comparable properties known in our galaxy are lbvs ) .",
    "gal - yam et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also noted that the relative rarity and spectral appearance of sne iin could be naturally explained by an origin in very massive lbvs ( with m@xmath16m@xmath6 ) .",
    "gal - yam & leonard ( 2009 ) subsequently presented post - explosion hst data of this event that showed the putative progenitor of sn 2005gl had disappeared , providing strong evidence that this sn iin had indeed originated from a single massive lbv - analog .",
    "these authors also analyzed the spectra of sn 2005gl and showed that the derived mass - loss rate was consistent with that of eruptive lbvs ( e.g. , p - cygni during its sixteenth century eruption ) .",
    "other work on additional sne supports the sn iin - lbv connection ( e.g. , smith et al .",
    "2007 ; trundle et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "it remains an open question how general the sn iin - lbv connection is , i.e. , are most or all sne iin related to lbvs , or stars with similar properties ? a literature - based study of this question is weakened due to the fact that the sample of sne iin published thus far may be highly biased , due to the tendency of authors to preferentially publish extreme or unusual events ( this is evident for many of the objects , as summarized in section @xmath17  [ historicsneiin ] and table  [ oldsniintable ] ) .",
    "here we present and analyze four sne iin observed by the caltech core - collapse project ( cccp ; gal - yam et al .",
    "2007b ; gal - yam et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "the cccp supernova sample is unbiased in the sense that essentially every young core - collapse sn that was observable from palomar observatory during the project was followed - up , without preference .",
    "thus , the objects included within the cccp should fairly represent the population of observed sne iin .",
    "typical wind velocities and mass - loss rates can therefore be derived , which may help constrain the properties of the progenitor stars .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in @xmath18",
    "we present our observations , and derive physical parameters for the sample in @xmath19 .",
    "we present an exhaustive literature review of sne iin in @xmath20 , and discuss our results in @xmath21 .",
    "we conclude with a summary in @xmath22 .",
    "the observations reported here were taken as part of the cccp ( gal - yam et al .",
    "2007b , gal - yam et al . 2010 in preparation ) .",
    "the cccp obtained photometric ( optical and near - ir ) and spectroscopic observations of 50 core - collapse sne .",
    "the program is designed to provide a fair sample of core - collapse events , with well - defined selection criteria and uniform , high - quality optical / ir observations .",
    "one of the goals of the cccp is to characterize the little - studied properties of core - collapse sne as a population .",
    "4 sne iin are included in the cccp sn sample .",
    "sn 2005bx was discovered by rich ( 2005 ) on april 27 , 2005 , and was absent on april 11 , 2005 .",
    "it was thus discovered within 16 days of explosion .",

    "photometry of all sne was corrected for galactic extinction ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ; via ned ) .",
    "the final light curves were also corrected for extinction in the host galaxy by first estimating using the iraf _ splot _ routine the equivalent width ( ew ) of the na i d absorption feature in our spectra and then calculating the excess color e(b - v ) from the ew using the formula of turatto et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in two cases ( sn 2005cl and sn 2005bx )",
    "an apparently unrelated noise fluctuation falls close to the na d feature in our best spectra .",
    "we also calculate an upper limit on the extinction assuming this apparent noise feature is due entirely to na d absorption .",
    "we view this upper limit as very conservative .",
    "therefore , we corrected the light curves shown for the most likely estimate reported in the table . in the mass loss calculations below we adopt the average between the likely estimate and upper limit as our extinction value , and propagate the range bracketed between these values in the mass loss error calculations .",
