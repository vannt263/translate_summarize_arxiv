    "determining the capacity region of the gaussian interference channel has been a long standing open problem .",
    "exact capacity results are known only for some special classes of interference channels such as the two user  very strong \" interference channel in @xcite and the two user strong interference channel @xcite .",
    "recent results on the capacity region of the two user gaussian interference channel include - the characterization of the capacity region to within one bit per channel use in @xcite and determining the sum capacity for the mixed interference regime and the very weak interference regime @xcite . for interference networks with more than @xmath1 users , capacity approximations within @xmath2 (",
    "also known as degrees of freedom ) have been found for time - varying ( or frequency - selective ) channels with coefficients drawn from a continuous distribution @xcite .",
    "capacity results are also available for multiuser extensions of the `` very weak interference '' scenario @xcite and for certain specific channel coefficient values , such as the toy examples in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors approximately characterize the capacity region of many - to - one and one - to - many gaussian interference channels using abstractions to deterministic interference channels .    in this paper , we study the @xmath0 user symmetric gaussian interference channel ( see figure [ fig : system model ] ) and derive a  very strong \" interference regime for this channel .",
    "a  very strong \" interference regime is one where the capacity region of the interference channel is the same as the capacity region of the channel with no interference . in this regime ,",
    "the interference can be perfectly canceled by all the receivers without incurring any associated rate penalties .",
    "we also present a  very strong \" interference condition for an example symmetric @xmath0 user deterministic interference channel ( see figure [ fig : detint ] ) . the main tool used in this paper in deriving the ",
    "very strong \" interference condition is lattice coding , where the transmitted codewords are lattice points .",
    "lattice and other structured coding techniques have been used recently to derive clever achievable schemes for several classes of networks .",
    "some relevant results include @xcite@xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : we describe the channel model in section ii . in section iii , we summarize the  very strong \" interference conditions for the two user gaussian interference channel and present our main results for the @xmath0 user interference channel .",
    "we describe notations and preliminaries on lattices in section iv .",
    "the proof of the main result for the three user interference channel is presented in section v. we conclude in section vi .",
    "we consider the @xmath0 user interference channel , consisting of @xmath0 transmitters , @xmath0 receivers , and @xmath0 independent messages , where message @xmath3 originates at transmitter @xmath4 and is intended for receiver @xmath5 . for simplicity of exposition , in this paper we consider only the symmetric ( gaussian ) interference channel model .",
    "we employ lattice coding at the transmitters and choose lattices such that the interference lattices align themselves at each receiver .",
    "this idea can be generalized to a much wider class of non - symmetric channels .",
    "the symmetric channel model is described as follows .",
    "[ fig : lem1 ]   user interference channel , title=\"fig:\",width=172 ]    @xmath6",
    "carleial @xcite showed that interference is not harmful when it is very strong , because the interfering signal can be decoded without any rate penalty for either the desired or the interfering user s message .",
    "for the symmetric channel described above , if @xmath16 and @xmath17 then interference can be decoded first while treating the desired signal as noise and without limiting the rate of the interfering user s message .",
    "this gives us the very strong interference condition as : @xmath18 each user achieves a rate @xmath19 which is his individual capacity in the absence of interference .",
    "for our purpose , this is also the defining property of `` very strong interference '' - i.e. , a @xmath0 user fully connected ( all channel coefficients are non - zero ) interference channel is called a `` very strong interference '' channel if every user achieves a rate equal to his individual capacity in the absence of all interference .",
    "one simple extension of the very strong interference condition for the symmetric @xmath0 user interference channel is readily obtained as follows .",
    "if @xmath20 then it is easily seen that each user can first jointly decode all interfering signals while treating his desired signal as noise and then subtract all interference from his received signal to achieve his interference - free capacity .",
    "this gives us the following `` very strong interference '' condition : @xmath21 condition ( [ eqn : strongdecode ] ) shows that each user can achieve his individual interference - free capacity if the strength of the interference scales exponentially with the number of users . as we show in this paper , this condition can be tightened quite significantly .",
    "the following example formulated in terms of the deterministic channel illustrates the key insights .",
    "[ fig : detint ] is the deterministic channel model ( as proposed by @xcite ) for a @xmath22 user fully connected interference channel . in this example",
    ", each user achieves a rate equal to the capacity that he would achieve in the absence of all interference .",
    "note that with all three users transmitting at capacity , a receiver is able to decode the desired message but can not decode any of the two interferers .",
    "however , each receiver is able to decode the _ sum _ of the codewords sent by the interfering users .",
    "for example , receiver @xmath23 can not decode the messages @xmath24 but it can decode the sum of the interfering codewords @xmath25 .    note that the example illustrated in fig . [",
    "fig : detint ] can be extended to any number of users . in the terminology of generalized degrees of freedom",
    "@xcite the `` very strong interference '' condition for this symmetric deterministic channel can be stated as : @xmath26 since @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the example suggests a very strong interference condition of the form @xmath29 for all @xmath0 , instead of the exponential increase with @xmath0 evident in the rhs of ( [ eqn : strongdecode ] ) .",
    "these insights are most relevant for our main result - a very strong interference condition for the @xmath0 user gaussian interference channel presented in the next section .      in this section we use lattice codes to align interference at each receiver in such a way that the sum of the interfering codewords can be decoded , without requiring the decodability of the messages carried by the interfering signals .",
    "relaxing the message decodability constraint produces a much tighter `` very strong interference '' condition for the @xmath0 user symmetric interference channel .",
    "lattice codes have previously been used in @xcite for interference alignment on the _ many - to - one _ and _ one - to - many _ interference channels , leading to capacity characterizations within a fixed number of bits per channel use for these channels . however , since we are interested in fully connected interference networks , several key aspects of the lattice code constructions in this section are unique to our setup .",
    "we present our main result below :    [ thm : main result ] for a @xmath0 user symmetric gaussian interference channel , if the channel gain @xmath14 satisfies @xmath30 the capacity region of the channel , denoted by @xmath31 is given @xmath32    in the rest of the paper , we prove this result for the three user interference channel @xmath33 .",
    "the proof technique used here can readily be extended for any @xmath0 .",
    "the region described by ( [ eqn : capacity ] ) is an outer bound on the capacity region for a three user interference channel for any value of @xmath14 .",
    "this is because @xmath34 is the maximum rate achieved by any user when there is no interference . to show that the region described by ( [ eqn : capacity ] ) for @xmath35 is achievable under  very strong interference \" given by ( [ eqn : tight constraint ] ) , we show that the symmetric rate point @xmath36 is achievable when ( [ eqn : tight constraint ] ) is satisfied . the transmitters use lattice coding to encode their messages ,",
    "while the receivers first decode the total interference and then decode their message after canceling all the interference .",
    "we describe some preliminaries on lattices in section [ sec : latticecoding ] and also present some results on lattice codes derived in @xcite and @xcite that will be used in the proof of theorem [ thm : main result ] .",
    "we then present the proof for achievability for the three user symmetric gaussian interference channel under  very strong interference \" in section [ sec : achievability ] .",
    "note that the  very strong \" interference condition for the @xmath0 user symmetric gaussian interference channel is different from the condition for the two user case given by @xmath37 .",

    "remark 2 : in decoding the interference at each receiver , the number of interference points does not affect the decoding probability of error .",

    " typical \" noise set .",
    "remark on theorem 2 : the proof of theorem 2 follows along lines very similar to that of theorem 1 .",
    "the main difference is that in the proof of theorem 2 , we use the loeliger approach in @xcite to decode the interference as well as the message . by using the loeliger approach in decoding the message",
    ", we note that each user can achieve a rate of only @xmath39 .",
    "in this paper , we derived a  very strong \" interference regime for the symmetric @xmath0 user gaussian interference channel .",

    "each receiver can decode the total interference seen , and then decode its message .",
    "the rate achieved by each user in this scenario is equal to @xmath84 , which is the maximum rate that can be achieved when no interference is present .",
