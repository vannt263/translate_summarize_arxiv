    "large - scale mimo systems with tens to hundreds of antennas are getting increased research attention @xcite-@xcite .",
    "because of its advantages of very high spectral efficiencies / sum rates , increased reliability , and power efficiency , large - scale mimo technology is being considered as a potential technology for next generation ( example , 5 g ) wireless systems @xcite .",
    "the following two characteristics are typical in conventional mimo systems : @xmath7 there will be one transmit radio frequency ( rf ) chain for each transmit antenna ( i.e. , if @xmath0 is the number of transmit antennas , then the number of transmit rf chains , @xmath1 , will also be @xmath0 ) , and @xmath8 information bits are carried only on the modulation symbols ( example , qam ) .",
    "conventional multiuser mimo systems with a large number ( tens to hundreds ) of antennas at the base station ( bs ) are referred to as ` massive mimo ' systems in the recent literature @xcite,@xcite .",
    "key technological issues that need to be addressed in practical realization of large - scale mimo systems include design and placement of compact antennas , multiple rf chains , and large - dimension transmit / receive signal processing techniques and algorithms @xcite-@xcite .",
    "spatial modulation ( sm ) , an attractive modulation scheme for multi - antenna communications @xcite,@xcite , can alleviate the requirement of multiple transmit rf chains in mimo systems . in sm ,",
    "the transmitter has multiple transmit antennas but only one transmit rf chain . in a given channel use",
    ", only one of the @xmath0 transmit antennas will be activated , and the remaining @xmath9 antennas remain silent . on the active transmit antenna , a symbol from a conventional modulation alphabet @xmath10 is transmitted .",
    "in addition to information bits conveyed through the modulation symbol from @xmath10 , the index of the active transmit antenna also conveys information bits .",
    "therefore , the number of bits conveyed in one channel use in sm is @xmath11 .",
    "space shift keying ( ssk ) is a special case of sm . like in sm , in ssk also only one antenna among @xmath0 antennas",
    "is activated in a given channel use . on the activated antenna , instead of sending a symbol from a conventional alphabet as is done in sm , a constant amplitude signal ( say , + 1 ) is transmitted in ssk . therefore , the number of information bits conveyed in one channel use in ssk is @xmath12 .",
    "for example , for @xmath13 , the two - bit combinations @xmath14 are mapped to antenna indices @xmath15 ; antenna 1 is activated when input bits are 00 , antenna 2 is activated when input bits are 01 , antenna 3 is activated when input bits are 10 , and antenna 4 is activated when input bits are 11 .",
    "the problem of ssk signal detection at the receiver in a given channel use then becomes one of finding which one among the @xmath0 antennas was activated , i.e. , determining the index of the active antenna .",
    "assuming that the choice of an active antenna among all antennas is equally likely and a ` + 1 ' was sent on the active antenna , and that the channel gains from @xmath0 transmit antennas to @xmath16 receive antennas are known at the receiver , the maximum likelihood ( ml ) decision rule to find the active antenna index is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the @xmath19 received signal vector and @xmath20 is the @xmath19 channel gain vector from transmit antenna @xmath21 to the receive antennas .",
    "the estimated antenna index @xmath22 is then demapped to the information bits which represent that index . in sm signal detection , in addition to detecting the active antenna index , information bits conveyed through the conventional modulation symbol carried on the active antenna also have to be detected .",
    "a lot of recent research has focused on sm and ssk in point - to - point as well as cooperative relaying settings ( see @xcite,@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "bit error performance of ssk and sm in single - user point - to - point communication has been analyzed in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "transmit diversity schemes for sm mimo ( i.e. , systems that combine sm and space - time coding ) have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "multiuser sm mimo on the downlink has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "ssk and sm employed on the uplink in multiuser mimo systems have been studied in @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite-@xcite , it has been shown that , for the same spectral efficiency , multiuser sm - mimo can outperform conventional multiuser mimo . in this paper , we are interested in a modulation scheme which is a generalization of sm , referred to as _",
    "generalized spatial modulation ( gsm ) _ @xcite,@xcite .",
    "gsm was introduced in @xcite and its achievable rate was studied in detail in @xcite . here , we are interested in the performance analysis and signal detection of multiuser gsm on the uplink in large - scale mimo systems .",
    "such a study has not been reported in the literature before .",
    "in gsm , the number of transmit rf chains , @xmath1 , is parameterized such that @xmath23 , and , in a given channel use , @xmath1 out of @xmath0 transmit antennas are chosen and activated @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the remaining @xmath24 antennas remain silent . on the chosen antennas , @xmath1 modulation symbols ( one on each chosen antenna )",
    "are transmitted .",
    "the indices of the @xmath1 active antennas out of @xmath0 available antennas convey @xmath25 information bits .",
    "this is in addition to the @xmath26 information bits conveyed by the @xmath1 modulation symbols .",
    "it can be seen that both sm and spatial multiplexing turn out to be special cases of gsm with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that for a given modulation alphabet and @xmath0 , there exists an optimum @xmath1 in gsm that maximizes the spectral efficiency .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the uplink in multiuser mimo systems , where the bs has a large number of receive antennas ( tens to hundreds ) and each user terminal employs gsm with @xmath0 transmit antennas and @xmath1 transmit rf chains . some gsm configurations of interest at the user terminal include : ( @xmath13 , @xmath27 ) , ( @xmath28 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "when @xmath29 and @xmath2 , gsm specializes to sm ; example , ( @xmath30 , @xmath2 ) , ( @xmath13 , @xmath2 ) .",
    "when @xmath31 and @xmath2 , gsm specializes to conventional modulation .",
    "our contributions in this paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "* we first analyze the average bit error probability ( abep ) of multiuser gsm - mimo under maximum - likelihood ( ml ) detection .",
    "we derive an upper bound on the abep , which is tight at moderate to high signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) .",
    "* we then propose low - complexity algorithms for gsm - mimo signal detection and channel estimation at the bs receiver based on message passing .",
    "the proposed receiver algorithms scale very well in complexity and achieve near - ml performance in large dimensions .",
    "simulation results show that , for the same spectral efficiency , multiuser gsm - mimo can outperform multiuser sm - mimo as well as conventional multiuser mimo , by about 2 to 9 db at a bit error rate ( ber ) of @xmath6 .",
    "such snr gains in gsm - mimo compared to sm - mimo and conventional mimo can be attributed to the fact that , because of a larger number of spatial index bits , gsm - mimo can use a lower - order qam alphabet which is more power efficient . *",
    "we carry out a study of the proposed and existing algorithms , which includes an assessment of their performance and computational complexity .",
    "simulation results show that the proposed detection algorithms have lesser complexity than minimum mean square error ( mmse ) detection complexity , while achieving significantly better performance than mmse detection performance .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the multiuser gsm - mimo system model on the uplink is presented in section [ sec2 ] . in section [ sec3 ]",

    "the gsm transmitter at the user terminal is shown in fig .",

    "define an ` antenna activation pattern ' to be an @xmath39 vector consisting of 1 s and 0 s , where a 1 in a coordinate indicates that the antenna corresponding to that coordinate is active and a 0 indicates that the corresponding antenna is silent .",
    "note that there are @xmath40 activation patterns possible .",
    "for example , for @xmath13 and @xmath27 , the following six activation patterns are possible :    out of the @xmath40 possible activation patterns , only @xmath41 activation patterns are needed for signaling .",
