    "identifying topological insulators has been one of the most fascinating research fields in contemporary condensed matter physics .",
    "@xcite topological insulators have a bulk gap like band insulators , but are distinguished by topologically protected conducting edge states preserving time - reversal invariance .",
    "in particular , two - dimensional topological insulators are known as quantum spin hall insulators with finite counter - propagating spin currents on the edge , analogous to quantum hall states .",
    "haldane  @xcite proposed that the fictitious magnetic fluxes in the honeycomb lattice lead to the quantum anomalous hall insulator ( or chern insulator ) .",
    "generalizing haldane s model including time reversal invariant spin - orbit coupling , it was theoretically shown that such a quantum spin hall insulator can exist in graphene .",
    "@xcite a two - dimensional semiconductor system with a uniform strain gradient was also proposed to be a candidate .",
    "@xcite later , the predicted edge states in hgcete quantum well systems  @xcite were experimentally verified which confirmed the existence of two - dimensional topological insulators .",
    "@xcite    the topological insulators in these systems normally exist due to strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "@xcite when the spin - orbit coupling preserves spin rotational symmetry about an axis , the counter - propagating edge modes which carry opposite spin quantum numbers result in quantum spin hall insulators .",
    "it was shown that these modes are protected by time reversal symmetry even in the absence of spin rotational invariance .",
    "@xcite it was further pointed out that an effective spin - orbit coupling term can be generated by spontaneous spin rotational symmetry breaking in an extended hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "@xcite in these studies , the structure of the honeycomb lattice plays an important role , as the tight binding model on this lattice possesses two dirac points at the brillouin zone corners .",
    "therefore in low energy description , various gapped insulating phases proximate to the dirac semi - metal can be understood in terms of mass perturbations to gapless dirac particles .",
    "for instance , the fictitious magnetic fluxes introduced by haldane generate a mass term that has the opposite signs at the two dirac points leading to an insulator with finite quantized hall conductivity .",
    "the dirac hamiltonian approach further provides a framework to understand the time - reversal invariant @xmath1 topological insulators .",
    "@xcite while systems on the honeycomb lattice such as graphene naturally support two - dimensional massless dirac particles in the bare band structures , this is not the case in a simple square lattice system which is an effective model for abundant layered perovskite materials in nature . in this respect",
    ", it is interesting to note that the recently proposed nodal density wave state  @xcite exhibits gapless dirac particles via broken translational symmetry .",
    "this proposal was made in the context of iron pnictide systems , where d - orbitals of t@xmath0 bands in an effectively two - dimensional square lattice give rise to several fermi pockets with interesting topological properties . in this system ,",
    "the spin density wave instability with the finite ordering wave vector @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) leads to band touchings between the @xmath4 states with the momentum difference of @xmath5 . in general",
    ", the degeneracies at the band touching points disappear because of the finite overlap matrix between the degenerate states induced by the density wave order parameter .",
    "however , in multi - orbital systems , because of the distinct symmetry properties of orbitals , the degeneracies at some band touching points are protected leading to nodal density wave states , which is generally valid for any density wave orders . in this work ,",
    "we ask if topological insulators can be emerged by gapping nodal points turning the system from nodal density wave states to topological density wave ( tdw ) insulators .",
    "to find such a tdw insulator , we first investigate the properties of the nodal density wave states .",
    "we find that one general and important characteristic of the dirac particles in nodal density wave states is that a pair of dirac hamiltonians connected by the inversion symmetry have the same topological winding numbers .",
    "thus an effective staggered on - site potential generating a mass term , which has the same signs at the inversion symmetric nodal points , induces tdw insulators .",
    "this can be contrasted with the topological properties of the dirac particles in the honeycomb lattice where the dirac hamiltonians at the two inversion symmetric nodal points have the opposite winding directions .",
    "@xcite thus the mass term induced by , for example , a staggered sublattice chemical potential , which has the same signs at the two dirac points would generate a topologically trivial band insulator as shown in graphene system.@xcite    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we first consider a simple two - band model hamiltonian composed of @xmath6 and @xmath7 orbitals on the square lattice . after classifying all possible charge and spin density wave order parameters with the ordering wave vector @xmath2 based on their transformation properties under lattice symmetries ,",
    "we establish general relations between the locations of dirac nodes and order parameter symmetries in sec .",
    "the fact that @xmath6 and @xmath7 orbitals have the opposite eigenvalues under reflection symmetries along high symmetry directions in the momentum space , plays the key role for the emergence of dirac points .",
    "in addition to the dirac points coming from the brillouin zone folding , additional contributions from quadratic band degeneracy splitting are also discussed . in sec .",
    "iv , topological properties of gapped density wave phases with two order parameters with the opposite reflection symmetries are studied .",
    "fully - gapped insulating phases can be obtained by introducing two density wave order parameters which have the opposite eigenvalues under reflection symmetries . among them , a certain combination turns the system to a tdw insulator . in sec .",
    "v , the mean field phase diagram including the tdw phase is presented , which is obtained by solving an extended hubbard model hamiltonian with orbital degeneracy .",
    "topological density wave states in three orbital systems are discussed in sec .",
    "straightforward extension to three - orbital systems shows the general applicability of the idea we pursue in this work to obtain topological insulators in multi - orbital systems .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "we consider a tight binding hamiltonian on the square lattice with two orbital ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) degrees of freedom at each site . a generic hamiltonian which contains all possible hopping processes allowed by lattice symmetries",
    "is given by    @xmath8    where @xmath9 here a two - component field @xmath10 = @xmath11 $ ] describes the creation of particles with @xmath6 and @xmath7 orbital flavors with spin @xmath12 , and the pauli matrix @xmath13 connects these two orbital states .",
    "in the above , @xmath14    diagonalization of @xmath15 gives rise to the following two band dispersions ,    @xmath16    in addition to time - reversal symmetry @xmath17 , the hamiltonian @xmath18 has the @xmath19 point group symmetry , which consists of the four - fold rotation @xmath20 , the inversion @xmath21 , and the two reflections @xmath22 and @xmath23 mapping @xmath24 to @xmath25 and @xmath26 to @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "each symmetry operation transforms a two - component field @xmath28 in the following way ,    @xmath29    if we choose the hopping parameters in such a way as @xmath30=-1.0 , @xmath31=1.3 , @xmath32 = @xmath33 = -0.85 , the @xmath18 works as an effective two - band hamiltonian describing the fe - pnictide systems .",
    "@xcite given the hopping parameters above , the fermi surface consists of two hole pockets and two electron pockets when the system is near half - filling .",
    "@xcite a pair of electron and hole pockets are connected by a nesting wave vector @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) , which drives various density wave instabilities.@xcite here we choose @xmath2  @xcite and perform a detailed study about the band structures of density wave ground states considering all possible density wave order parameters .    .",
    "( a ) @xmath34 charge density wave ( @xmath34-cdw ) ordering . @xmath6 and @xmath7 orbitals align alternatively along the @xmath24 direction while local charge and spin densities are uniform .",
    "( b ) @xmath35 spin density wave ( @xmath35-sdw ) ordering . here",
    "orbital and spin orderings occur at the same time .",
    "a solid circle represents the @xmath36 orbital defined as @xmath37 while a dotted circle indicates the @xmath38 orbital given by @xmath39 .",
    "the arrows inside circles describe spin ordering .",
    ", width=8 ]      we consider various on - site density wave order parameters and investigate their symmetry properties .",
    "since we have two orbitals per site , there are 4 different on - site charge density wave ( cdw ) states with the ordering wave vector @xmath2 , which are given by    @xmath40_{ab } d_{b,\\sigma}(\\textbf{k}+\\textbf{q}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 , @xmath42 are indices describing the @xmath6 ( @xmath41=1 ) or @xmath7 ( @xmath41=2 ) orbital states .",
    "@xmath43 counts the number of unit cells in the system .",
    "similarly , we also define spin density wave ( sdw ) states choosing the spin ordering direction along the @xmath44-axis ,    @xmath45_{ab}[s^{z}]_{\\sigma_{1 } \\sigma_{2 } } d_{b,\\sigma_{2}}(\\textbf{k}+\\textbf{q}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these 8 order parameters represent distinct phases with different broken symmetries . for example , the @xmath34 cdw order parameter corresponds to @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the density of electrons with the orbital @xmath41 at the site @xmath48 .",
    "thus it is characterized by the relative density difference between two orbitals ( orbital ordering ) , which alternates along the @xmath24 direction , while keeping the total density @xmath49 uniform on every site as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : orderparameters ] ( a ) .",
    "this breaks translational symmetry doubling the unit cell along @xmath24 direction . on the other hand , the @xmath35 sdw order parameter described in fig .",
    "[ fig : orderparameters ] ( b ) corresponds to a staggered spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this is because @xmath35 can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "however , unlike the uniform spin - orbital coupling @xmath53 , the @xmath54 is a staggered spin - orbit coupling with alternating signs along the @xmath24 direction .",
    "it breaks spin - rotational and translational symmetries but preserves time reversal symmetry .",
    "in addition , @xmath55 and @xmath56 describe conventional charge and spin density wave states , respectively .",
    "it was found that @xmath56 describes the leading density wave instability in fe - pnictides .",
    "@xcite    the above 8 order parameters can be distinguished by their transformation properties under lattice symmetries .",
    "the symmetries of density wave order parameters are summarized in table  [ table : order_symmetry ] .",
    ".symmetry of density wave order parameters . here ` + ' ( ` - ' ) indicates ` even ' ( ` odd ' ) symmetry of the order parameters under the corresponding symmetry operation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to investigate the topological property of the gapped phase , we compute the spin chern numbers of the bands . since the @xmath44 component of the spin @xmath57 is still conserved , the spin chern number is a well - defined quantity . in table",
    "[ table : chernnumbers_threeband ] , we show the distribution of the spin chern numbers for several values of @xmath58 supporting fully gapped phases . here",
    "@xmath59 indicates the spin chern number of the @xmath60th band defined as @xmath61 where @xmath62(=-@xmath63 ) denotes the chern number of the @xmath60th spin - up band .",
    "we label that the band 1 has the highest energy and the band index @xmath60 increases as the energy eigenvalue decreases . in the case of the gapped phase that is obtained by adding a small @xmath58 on the nodal charge density wave state with @xmath64 , only the 4th and 5th band support nonzero spin chern numbers shown in the 2nd column of table  [ table : chernnumbers_threeband ] .",
    "interestingly , however , as the magnitude of @xmath58 increases , band gap closing and reopening occur successively .",
    "for instance , for the uniform density wave state with @xmath65 , the first gap closing happens between the band 1 and 2 for @xmath66 .",
    "as @xmath58 increases further , another fully gapped phase is obtained with the spin chern numbers displayed in the 3rd column of table  [ table : chernnumbers_threeband ] .",
    "it is interesting to notice that after the gap closing and reopening process , the number of the bands supporting finite spin chern numbers has increased .",
    "similar gap closing happens again for @xmath67 leading to the redistribution of the spin chern numbers shown in the last column of table  [ table : chernnumbers_threeband ] .",
    "note that all cases with 1/3 filling give tdw insulators , while tdw phase with 5/6 filling occurs only for the @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "in this paper , we investigate theoretically if topological insulators can be achieved from a nodal density wave state with broken translational symmetry . while a nonzero density wave order parameter in general opens a gap between the degenerate states connected by the ordering wave vector , nodal density wave phases occur in multi - orbital systems via translational symmetry breaking due to the distinct symmetry properties of orbitals .",
    "such a nodal density wave state supports a large number of dirac nodes between neighboring bands .",
    "we have explicitly proved that a pair of inversion symmetric dirac points share the same topological winding numbers in nodal density wave states contrary to the dirac points in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "if we introduce an additional order parameter whose transformation property under reflection symmetries is opposite to that of the underlying order parameter , the system can be a gapped insulator at certain filling factors . among those insulators , time - reversal invariant tdw insulators with helical edge states",
    "are identified .",
    "the existence of a nodal density wave ground state is experimentally verified in a recent arpes measurement on bafe@xmath70as@xmath70  @xcite and quantum oscillation experiments on bafe@xmath70as@xmath70 and srfe@xmath70as@xmath70 .",
    "@xcite it is interesting to notice that , according to these experimental studies , the velocity of dirac fermions is estimated to be 14 - 20 times slower than that in graphene .",
    "@xcite this implies that the dirac fermions in nodal density wave states are more susceptible to interaction effects .",
    "however , according to our mean field calculation , it seems to be difficult to realize quantum spin hall insulators in fe pnictides system , as it favors a conventional spin density wave state ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "our results in general imply that transition metal materials with two - dimensional square lattice structure possessing partially filled @xmath72 orbitals are good candidates for tdw insulators . in particular , in the case of the effective two - orbital ( three - orbital ) model ,",
    "the 1/4 filled ( 1/3 filled ) system is the most promising for the realization of tdw insulators . however , to make a prediction on real materials with layered perovskite structure , it is important to generalize our study to three dimensional systems taking into account interlayer couplings .",
    "stacking of two dimensional tdw insulators simply leads to a weak topological insulator .",
    "@xcite therefore identifying three dimensional tdw phases with a nontrivial strong topological invariant in the layered perovskite structure is an interesting but challenging future work .    finally , it is worthwhile to comment the consequences of relaxing the constraint of time - reversal invariance .",
    "when an imaginary charge density wave state ( @xmath73 ) breaking time - reversal symmetry occurs in the presence of a nodal density wave state , a gapped topological phase with topologically protected edge modes can be developed .",
    "in contrast to the case of the quantum spin hall insulator , here the spin - up and down bands have the same chern number , which gives rise to an insulator with finite hall conductance .",
    "interestingly , the imaginary charge density wave state is one of the competing ground states in iron pnictide systems ,  @xcite which is expected to be achieved in real materials .",
    "@xcite thus searching for gapped phases proximate to nodal density wave states is a new avenue to topological phases .                                                                                        in ref .",
    ", @xmath74 and @xmath75 was fixed by @xmath76 to make the electron pockets have pure @xmath77 character along @xmath78 and @xmath79 directions .",
    "since this additional constraint generates accidental band crossing points , we introduce 10 percent modulation in the magnitude of @xmath74 , which does not affect the overall band structure and the shape of the fermi surfaces ."
