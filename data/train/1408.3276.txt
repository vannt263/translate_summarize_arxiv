    "in the past @xmath015 yr the study of cooling neutron stars in transiently accreting x - ray binaries has emerged as a new approach to understanding the structure of neutron stars .",
    "@xcite discussed how the neutron - star crust in transiently accreting systems could be driven out of thermal equilibrium with the neutron - star core .",
    "some of the heat that is generated by non - equilibrium nuclear reactions deep in the neutron - star crust during an outburst @xcite is radiated away in quiescence and this should result in observable cooling of the neutron - star surface , especially in systems that have undergone long - duration outbursts @xcite . by following the detailed evolution of the surface temperature during quiescence one can then extract information on the properties of the neutron - star crust .    the neutron - star transient ks 1731260  provided the first opportunity to test this when it returned to quiescence following an outburst of more than 12.5 yr @xcite . during its first year in quiescence",
    "ks 1731260  indeed showed significant cooling @xcite , and this continued during the next decade @xcite .",
    "following ks 1731260 , cooling of neutron stars heated by transient accretion has been studied in a handful of systems : mxb 165929 @xcite , xte j1701462  @xcite , exo 0748676 @xcite , and igr j174802446 @xcite .",
    "these systems had outburst durations ranging from @xmath011 weeks to @xmath024 yr , and the outburst - averaged luminosities ranged from a few percent of the eddington luminosity ( @xmath5 ) to @xmath0@xmath5 .",
    "the ( long - term ) cooling seen in these systems has been modeled by a variety of cooling curves from increasingly sophisticated thermal evolution codes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "together this has resulted in valuable insights into the thermal conductivity of the neutron - star crust , the location of heat sources in the crust , and , in some cases , the cooling mechanisms at work in the neutron - star core and crust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "the temperatures of the neutron star in maxi j0556332  during its first @xmath0500 days in quiescence are extraordinarily high compared to those measured for other cooling neutron stars ( see figure [ fig : sources ] ) . even at 500 days into quiescence its temperature is higher than the maximum quiescent temperature seen in the other five cooling systems .",
    "it likely is also hotter than the neutron star in sax j1750.82900 , which was claimed by @xcite to be the hottest quiescent neutron star in an x - ray binary system , although maxi j0556332  is expected to continue cooling for a while .",
    "the obtained temperatures for maxi j0556332  are sensitive to the assumed distance ( see table [ tab : fits ] ) , but even for distances well below our estimated distance range ( e.g. , 20 kpc ) we find temperatures ( 134218 ev for model i and 131195 ev for model ii ) that are substantially higher than those observed in xte j1701462  during its first @xmath0500 days ( 125163 ev ) .",
    "the short cooling timescale observed in maxi j0556332  implies a high thermal conductivity of the crust , similar to the other cooling neutron stars that have been studied .",
    "given the similarities between the outbursts of maxi j0556332  and xte j1701462 , it is interesting to compare these two systems in more detail , as it may help us understand what causes the neutron - star crust in maxi j0556332  to be so hot .",
    "maxi j0556332  was in outburst for @xmath0480 days with a time - averaged luminosity of @xmath01.7@xmath9 ergs@xmath10 , while xte j1701462  was in outburst for @xmath0585 days with a time - averaged luminosity @xmath02.0@xmath11 ergs@xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the total radiated energies of the maxi j0556332  and xte j1701462  outbursts are therefore 7.1@xmath12 erg and 1.0@xmath13 erg , respectively .",
    "despite the fact that the radiated energies and time - averaged luminosities of the two systems are comparable , the initial luminosity of the thermal component ( which reflects the temperature at shallow depths in the crust at the end of the outburst ) is an order of magnitude higher in maxi j0556332  than in xte j1701462 .",
    "this suggests the presence of additional shallow heat sources in the crust of maxi j0556332  and/or that the shallow heat sources in maxi j0556332  were more efficient per accreted nucleon .",
    "the high observed temperatures are difficult to explain with current crustal heating models . bringing the initial temperatures down to those seen in xte j1701462  requires a distance of @xmath01015 kpc ( depending on the assumed model ) .",
    "such distances are problematic for several reasons .",
    "first it implies that z source behavior in maxi j0556332  is observed at much lower luminosities ( by factors of nine or more ) than in other z sources .",
    "second , fits to the quiescent spectra with such a small distance are of poor quality .",
    "finally , a smaller distance does not solve the fact that crustal heating appears to have been much more efficient per accreted nucleon than in other sources .",
    "a reduction in distance by a factor of three results in a reduction in luminosity and presumably then , by extension , the total mass accreted onto the neutron star and total heat injected into the crust by a factor of nine . given that we inferred @xmath030% less mass accreted onto the neutron star in maxi j0556332  during its outburst than in xte j1701462  for our preferred distance of @xmath045 kpc",
    ", this would mean @xmath012 times less mass accreted onto maxi j0556332  than xte j1701462 yet similar initial temperatures .",
    "the nsa model that we used to fit the thermal emission from the neutron star in maxi j0556332  did not allow us to explore values of the neutron - star parameters other than @xmath14 and @xmath15 km , as these parameters are advised to remain fixed at those values @xcite .",
    "while other neutron - star atmosphere models allow for changes in @xmath16 and @xmath17 , none of the available models are able to handle the high temperatures observed during the first @xmath0200 days of quiescence .",
    "it is , of course , possible that the properties of the neutron star in maxi j0556332  are significantly different from those in the other cooling neutron - star transients that have been studied .",
    "lower temperatures would be measured if one assumed a lower @xmath16 and/or a larger @xmath17 . to estimate the effects of changes in neutron - star parameters we used the nsatmos model to fit the spectrum of observation 11 , initially assuming @xmath14 and @xmath1810 km . while keeping the distance from this fit fixed , and changing @xmath16 to 1.2@xmath2 and @xmath17 to 13 km ( values that are still reasonable ) , the measured temperature was reduced by only @xmath010% .",
    "such changes are not large enough to reconcile the temperatures measured in maxi j0556332  with those of the other sources .    an alternative explanation for the high inferred temperatures could be that part of the quiescent thermal emission is caused by low - level accretion .",
    "indications for low - level accretion in early quiescence were seen in the form of small flares in the _",
    "swift_/xrt light curve ( figure [ fig : curves]b ; see below for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "the level of accretion in between those flares , where most of our observations were done , is unclear however .",
    "@xcite suggest that low - level accretion onto neutron stars can result in thermal emission , although it would be hard to distinguish it from that of a cooling neutron star @xcite .",
    "an additional hard x - ray component could be produced by emission from a radiatively inefficient ( advection - dominated ) accretion flow @xcite and/or by energetic protons illuminating the neutron - star surface @xcite . as shown in section [ sec : spectra ] , we find that the addition of a power - law to our spectral model ( to fit the hard , non - thermal emission ) presents a minor , but statistically significant improvement to our fits of the quiescent spectra of maxi j0556332 .",
    "we also find that , when adding a power - law , the fluxes of the power - law and thermal components are strongly correlated ( see table [ tab : bestfit2 ] ) , which one would expect if low - level accretion played a significant role .",
    "however , the index of the power - law is unusually low and when fixing it to commonly observed values ( @xmath19=1.52 ) the addition of a power - law no longer presents a statistical improvement .",
    "it is possible that the nsa model simply does not present a good - enough description of the thermal emission from a non - accreting neutron star and that the ( shallow ) power law is merely fitting the resulting discrepancies ; this would likely also result in correlated behavior between the nsa and power - law fluxes , as observed .",
    "@xcite showed that xte j1701462  likely had not yet reached a steady - state temperature profile at the end of its 19-month outburst . as a result of this",
    ", the crust temperature profile had a dip at intermediate densities , leading to a temporary plateau in the temperature decay followed by late - time cooling , both of which have now been observed in xte j1701462  ( j.k .",
    "fridriksson et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "given the outburst similarities between xte j1701462  and maxi j0556332 , we expect the cooling curve of maxi j0556332  to eventually show similar features , although their onset may occur at different times than in xte j1701462 .    in observations",
    "4 and 6 large increases in the neutron - star temperature and luminosity and power - law luminosity were seen with respect to the overall trend .",
    "this behavior is similar to that of two flares seen during the quiescent phase of xte j1701462  @xcite .",
    "additional flares can be seen in the _ swift _  light curves shown in figure [ fig : curves]b .",
    "significant flare - like variations in the quiescent luminosity of other ns - lmxbs have been reported as well : e.g. , a strong @xmath2016 d flare in sax j1750.82900 @xcite , a similarly strong ( @xmath03@xmath21 ergs@xmath10 ) @xmath204 day flare in ks 1741293 @xcite , and a @xmath01 week @xmath09@xmath21 ergs@xmath10 flare in grs j17412853 @xcite .",
    "variations on timescales of hours to years have also been observed in the quiescent emission of cen x-4 @xcite , aql x-1 @xcite , and sax j1808.43658 @xcite .",
    "the origin of these flares and variations are almost certainly accretion related .",
    "the decay timescale of the second flare observed in xte j1701462  is similar to that of the main outburst decay @xcite , suggesting a common ( possibly viscous ) timescale .",
    "the decay of the first of the flares seen in maxi j0556332  with _ swift _ , a @xmath010 d flare which ended just before our first _ chandra _  observation ( see figure [ fig : curves]a ) , is reasonably well resolved with _ swift _  and has a decay timescale of a few days , also similar to that of the outburst decay . moreover",
    ", the power - law flux increases strongly during the flares and such strongly variable power - law components are not expected from a cooling neutron star , whereas they are commonly associated with low - level accretion , both onto neutron stars and black holes .",
    "finally , the fact that the thermal and non - thermal component are correlated during the flares suggests that the accretion flow is reaching the neutron - star surface .",
    "for this reason , the flare observations are not considered in our modeling of the cooling curves .",
    "in addition to the early flaring activity , maxi j0556332  showed a much stronger rebrightening event , starting around day @xmath0170 of quiescence ; it lasted for @xmath060 days , reached a luminosity of @xmath08@xmath22 ergs@xmath10 , and had an average luminosity of @xmath04.4@xmath23 ergs@xmath10 . although the fluence of this event was a factor of @xmath033 smaller than that of the main outburst , it is only @xmath030% smaller than , e.g. , the 2010 outburst of igr j174802446 , in which moderate heating occurred @xcite .",
    "however , our observations after the large rebrightening event did not suggest strong deviations from the ongoing cooling trend .",
    "the distance to maxi j0556332  remains an uncertain factor in our fits to the quiescent spectra and modeling of the cooling curve , and this complicates the comparison with other sources .",
    "we have employed two methods to estimate the distance to the source : one was a comparison of the cd / hid tracks with those of other z sources and the other the quiescent spectral fits themselves . in the other cooling neutron - star transients that have been studied ,",
    "quiescent spectral fits suffer in general from a high degree of degeneracy between the normalization ( which depends on the distance and neutron - star radius ) and the temperature of the neutron - star atmosphere spectral component .",
    "due to the low effective temperature , the small effective area of the detectors at the lowest energies , and the effects of interstellar absorption , it is primarily the high - energy tail of the thermal component that is being fitted , and usually fits of similar quality can be obtained for a rather wide range of distance ( and/or radius ) values .",
    "this degeneracy is broken to a significant extent in maxi j0556332  due to the very low absorption towards the source and the ( presumably ) much higher temperatures exhibited by it .",
    "the fits are quite sensitive to the value of the normalization and it was not possible to achieve fits of adequate quality except for large distance values .",
    "our confidence in such a large value for the distance to the system is strengthened by the fact that the fits with these large distance values also give @xmath24  values that are consistent with other measurements , whereas significantly smaller distance values do not , and the fact that the best - fit distance ( @xmath045@xmath13 kpc for @xmath17 = 10 km ) is nicely consistent with the range we estimate from the cd / hid tracks of the source during outburst ( @xmath046@xmath115 kpc ) .",
    "our distance estimates put maxi j0556332  far into the galactic halo .",
    "while such a location is not common for x - ray binaries , there are several other systems whose properties also suggest very large distances : e.g. , gs 135464 has a distance greater than 27 kpc @xcite and igr j170913624 could be as distant as 35 kpc if its mass and luminosity are similar to grs 1915 + 105 @xcite , although both sources lie close to the galactic plane",
    ". an optical spectrum of the companion star in quiescence might provide a better handle on the distance to maxi j0556332  than the above methods .",
    "we are grateful to harvey tananbaum , belinda wilkes , and the _ chandra _ team for allowing us to use the remaining time of a previously triggered target of opportunity program .",
    "we also thank norbert schartel for approving two _ xmm - newton _  director s discretionary time observations , and neil gehrels and his team for the flexible scheduling of our _ swift _  observations .",
