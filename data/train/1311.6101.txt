    "an important result in section [ sec : fmheis ] is the mapping of the hamiltonian dynamics onto that of a diffusing string .",
    "the string can be parametrized by internal variables determining the shape of the string ( dynamics of a heisenberg model ) and an arbitary boundary point which is moving on a one - dimensional line .",
