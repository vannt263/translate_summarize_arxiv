    "the topic of the history of star - formation in the universe has excited much interest in recent years , stimulated by the first observations of nearly - normal star - forming galaxies at @xmath10 ( steidel  1996 ) .",
    "previously high - redshift studies were limited to highly active galaxies that may be poor tracers of the typical star - formation history of the universe as a whole .",
    "steidel  used the colour signature of the lyman break / lyman-@xmath11 forest discontinuity being redshifted through optical filters to select high - redshift objects ( guhathakurta  1990 ) , these were subsequently confirmed spectroscopically on the 10 m w.m .",
    "keck telescope .",
    "comparison of these objects with the low - redshift ( @xmath12 ) samples of field galaxies ( lilly  1995 , ellis , 1996 ) appears to show a rise in the universal star - formation rate from @xmath13 to @xmath1 and a drop - off at @xmath10 indicating a star - formation peak in the @xmath12 epoch ( madau  1996 ) .",
    "this is also inferred to be the epoch when large galaxies with classical elliptical and spiral morphologies are assembled : hubble space telescope observations indicate they are extant at @xmath1 ( brinchmann  1998 , lilly  1998 ) but absent in the @xmath10 sample ( giavalisco  1996 , lowenthal 1997 ) .",
    "theoretical developments using galaxy formation simulations constrained by the observed evolution in the density of neutral gas from lyman-@xmath11 qso absorbers show qualitative agreement with this picture ( fall  1996 ) .",
    "however these measurements of star - formation rate are based upon the measurement of ultraviolet continuum luminosity , 15002800  in the rest - frame , assumed to be from young stellar populations .",
    "if dust extinction played a significant role in obscuring uv radiation they could be under - estimated by large factors which may change the picture completely .",
    "a more robust way to measure the star - formation rate of high - redshift galaxies would be to measure their luminosities in balmer recombination lines .",
    "this radiation come from reprocessed ionising radiation emitted by young stars .",
    "this approach has two advantages : firstly the ionising radiation comes from more massive short lived stars than the softer 15002800  uv and hence falls quickly to zero only 20 myr after star - formation stops . thus the balmer luminosity is a more direct measure of the _ instantaneous _ star - formation rate .",
    "this contrasts with the uv which continues to rise as the stellar populations evolve , typically doubling for example between 10 and 1000 myr at 1500 . for  the main dependence",
    "is directly on the initial mass function and negligibly on the temporal evolution .",
    "the second main advantage is that the balmer radiation is emitted in the red part of the optical spectrum and is thus much less affected by any dust extinction or attenuation than the ultraviolet .",
    "for example for typical smc and milky way extinction laws ( pei 1992 ) the 1500and 2800  extinctions ( in magnitudes ) range from 27 times greater than that at  ( 6563 ) .",
    "however to observe  at high - redshift requires infrared spectroscopy , which has not been possible until recently because of the faintness of the sources involved .",
    "pettini  ( 1998 ) have secured the first ir spectra of 5 of the @xmath10 steidel galaxies , and obtained  luminosities . in this paper",
    "we report the results of the first measurements of the  line in a sample of normal @xmath14 field galaxies drawn from the canada - france redshift survey ( lilly  1995 , le fevre  1995 , lilly  1995b , hammer  1995 ) .",
    "this sample ( hereafter ` cfrs ' ) is a highly - complete redshift survey of a magnitude - selected ( @xmath15 ) sample of normal field galaxies .",
    "the median redshift is 0.6 , and galaxies extend out to @xmath16 . because the sample is magnitude selected the @xmath17 end is dominated by luminous @xmath18 galaxies",
    "the observations were carried out on may 10 - 11 and october 3 - 5 1996 at the uk infrared telescope in hawaii using the cgs4 spectrograph ( wright 1994 ) .",
    "we chose galaxies in the redshift range 0.790 - 1.048 so that the  line would lie in the relatively clean part of the near - infrared @xmath0-band ( 1.17 - 1.34 ) where the atmospheric extinction is relatively low ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "we also selected galaxies with detectable [ oii ] emission in the optical cfrs spectra which make up 85% of the cfrs sample at @xmath20 .    as well as absorption ,",
    "the @xmath0-band is contaminated by numerous airglow oh emission lines , which increase the broad - band sky - brightness by a factor of 30 and hinders the detection of faint objects .",
    "our observational strategy was to observe at high - resolution with cgs4 , thus resolving out the oh background . because we already knew the galaxies redshifts from the optical spectra the limited wavelength coverage at high - resolution was not a problem .",
    "moreover we could exclude galaxies whose redshifts would put the  line on or close to an oh line .",
    "( a similar strategy was also adopted by pettini ) we observed with the 150 lines / mm grating and the 1 arcsec/1 pixel slit giving a resolution @xmath21 .",
    "we determined empirically that at this resolution oh lines contaminated 50% of the bandpass , _ i.e. _ we had to exclude 50% of the high - redshift galaxies , but in the remaining clean part of the bandpass the mean background was only 20% that of broad @xmath0 .    targets were acquired using the following procedure : first we ` peaked - up ' on a very bright star ( @xmath22 mags ) within 12 degrees of the target .",
    "this involves centering the star on the optical finder tv , reading the ir array in a continuous ` movie ' mode , and then adjusting the offset between the axis of cgs4 and the tv until the ir flux is maximised .",
    "this assures the ir slit is aligned with the tv crosshair .",
    "then we went to a fainter star , typically 17th mag , within 12 arcmin of our target galaxy and measured off the same coordinate system , centered the star on the tv crosshair and did a blind offset on to the target galaxy .",
    "( the targets were too faint to see on the tv ) .",
    "we would then autoguide either on the offset star or another bright star in the region .",
    "observations were made stepping the insb detector array in 0.5 pixel increments to fully sample the instrument profile and nodding the telescope @xmath23 9 arcsec along the slit between ` object ' and ` sky ' positions to facilitate sky - subtraction ( though note the object is still on the slit in both positions ) .",
    "individual exposures ranged from 10 - 15 minutes .",
    "the typical seeing was 1.0 arcsec .",
    "a total of 13 objects were observed : these are listed with their total exposure times in table  [ tab - observations ] .",
    "standard wavelength calibration and flatfield corrections were applied .",
    "the october observing run was affected by the spectrograph slit being jammed out of position which caused the lines to be tilted on the image .",
    "the shifts were measured by cross - correlation and the tilt corrected by re - interpolation .    even with the resolved",
    "oh background accurate sky - subtraction is critical to detection of faint lines . to first order the sky",
    "can be removed by simply subtracted the pairs of offset frames , though this leaves residual signal due to temporal sky changes . to second order the residual sky",
    "was removed by performing a polynomial interpolation along the slit , excluding the two object regions , and subtracting .",
    "this leaves no systematic residual , though the regions near the oh lines are still noisier due to the extra poisson contribution , with the result being a 2d image with a positive spectrum in the ` object ' row and a negative spectrum in the ` sky ' row . for each image we also made a pixel mask to exclude bad pixels on the detector and regions with noisy oh residuals .    in many of the images",
    "there were strong  and continuum detections .",
    "we summed all the  lines with good detections , fitted gaussians spectrally and spatially to define the typical line profile and then used this mean profile ( with the pixel mask ) to optimally extract all bright , faint and possibly non - detected objects in a consistent manner .    in most of our observations",
    "we found that the negative spectrum was typically weaker , or even absent , compared to the positive spectrum .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that any small errors in acquisition are magnified when stepping 9 arcsec away from the centre along the slit as the rotation is not precisely known .",
    "when there was a significant negative spectrum it was combined in a weighted manner ( to maintain consistent exposure times ) into the positive spectrum .",
    "this marginally increases the signal@xmath24noise , though none of the flux measurements presented below are significantly changed if this step is omitted .",
    "next the spectra had atmospheric absorption removed using a smooth - spectrum standard and were flux calibrated using flux standards .",
    "finally we applied aperture corrections to allow for our finite 1.0 arcsec wide slit .",
    "our objects are resolved , our mean gaussian spatial profile along the slit of the  line has a fwhm of 2.0 arcsec ( which is consistent with the typical 35 arcsec isophotal optical diameters measured for the cfrs sample ( hammer  1997 ) ) .",
    "the flux calibration stars are observed through the same slit in 1.0 arcsec seeing .",
    "assuming gaussian profiles for both we derive a relative correction factor of 1.7 , by which we multiply our spectra .",
    "while this can only be a rough correction , it gives fluxes consistent with the optical lines ( see section [ sec - completeness ] ) .",
    "it is also only of order unity , so even if ignored our conclusions below are not drastically altered .",
    "the continuum level was determined in each case by taking the mean of the data points @xmath23 0.02 microns either side of the emission line , ignoring the masked points and the emission line .",
    "the noise level of the data was determined empirically from the rms in the same region . in most cases we found significant continuum emission .",
    "note that for individual pixels the continuum is mostly below the noise , it is only by summing up we get a significant detection . to check the validity of our measurements we repeated the same procedure for an off - object row in the longslit spectra",
    "this give non - detections in all cases , so we are confident in our procedure .    after subtraction of the continuum level from the data we computed the line flux by summing the flux @xmath25 pixels around the line , excluding the masked pixels , where @xmath26 is chosen to be the typical line fwhm .",
    "this is done regardless of whether there appears to be a detection or not ( as the expected wavelength is known ) .    the final line fluxes and continuum fluxes ( converted to ab mags and denoted @xmath27 ) are given in table  [ tab - observations ] , along with the most useful cfrs parameters of our objects .",
    "fluxes @xmath28 are set @xmath29 .",
    "we find 7 detections @xmath30 and 5 detections @xmath31 out of our 13 objects .",
    "we convert these to luminosities using a @xmath6 km s@xmath4 mpc,@xmath4 and @xmath7 cosmology in table  [ tab - luminosities ] .",
    "we use this cosmology for the rest of our paper .",
    "we note that in our further analysis our conclusions are based on comparing the luminosities of the same galaxies at different wavelengths , since all the galaxies in our sample lie close to @xmath1 our conclusions are essentially unchanged if we use a different cosmology .    to complete the quantities derived from the lines we fit gaussians profiles ( excluding masked pixels ) to derive velocity line widths for all our detections .",
    "each of the fits was checked visually by plotting on top of the line ; the instrumental resolution was determined by fitting to unresolved night - sky oh lines in the region of the galaxy line and the value was subtracted in quadrature from the galaxy line widths .",
    "it should be noted that all our lines , but one , are well - resolved as we expected given the spectral resolution and the typical velocity widths of galaxies .",
    "the spectra line full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the galaxies range from 35 pixels ( one pixel @xmath32 23   depending on the spectrum ) compared to 2.42.6 pixels for the sky lines .",
    "the results are presented in table  [ tab - luminosities ] ; we make no detailed analysis here , we just note that the typical velocity fhwms are in the range 200400 km@xmath24sec expected for large @xmath33 galaxies .",
    "in @xmath34 of the galaxy spectra  emission was detected ; additionally @xmath35 of the galaxies had detected continuum emission .",
    "this proves quite useful : we can check if our line non - detections are due to poor acquisition by comparing the continuum level of our line detections and non - detections .",
    "there are only two cases in which there is no line _ and _ no continuum detection .",
    "the general trend is that the average continuum flux is _ brighter _ for the non - detections , this translates in to an median @xmath36 colour 1.1 mags _ redder_. this argues against the slit missing the object , in fact the trend towards redder colours is precisely what is expected for non - line emitting objects .",
    "we note that at @xmath1 a scd galaxy should have observed colours @xmath37 and an e / so galaxy @xmath38 , using template seds from kennicutt ( 1992 ) .",
    "we find median colours of @xmath39 for the  detections and @xmath40 for the non - detections , which agree very well given our actual galaxies will differ in detail from kennicutt s templates .",
    "figure  [ fig - spec ] shows the final set of spectra , which have been continuum subtracted and centered on the  line .",
    "the line is in all cases found within the error box given by the optical redshift ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "our resolution is high enough that  is well separated from the [ nii ] lines so we do not have to correct for blending .",
    "also in a few cases ( e.g objects 22.1406 and 22.070 ) we see evidence for one of the weaker [ nii ] lines as well as the main  line .",
    "this is additional evidence for the robustness of our detections .",
    "note in many cases the position of one or both of the [ nii ] lines is occluded by a noisy oh residual .",
    "we can also test our completeness using cfrs values for the [ oii ] flux ( hammer  1997 ) to calculate a /[oii ] line ratio . in the cfrs sample in this redshift range 85% of galaxies have [ oii ] emission .",
    "hammer  tabulate the [ oii ] equivalent width and flux , the latter is aperture - corrected by comparing the spectra at @xmath42 with their @xmath43-band image photometry .",
    "other than excluding galaxies with zero [ oii ] emission we made no attempt to concentrate on objects with the strongest [ oii ] emission .",
    "thus the mean [ oii ] equivalent width ( 32 ) and range ( 1060 ) of our small sub - sample are consistent with random sampling from the larger sample .",
    "the cfrs galaxies at @xmath1 with zero [ oii ] are all at the red end of the colour distributions in @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "thus the colours also indicate they are not significant star - forming systems and we conclude their exclusion has no significant impact on our conclusions below .",
    "one might also ask the question : is the lack of  detection in some of our objects consistent with the _ presence _ of [ oii ] in our optical spectra ?",
    "this is addressed in figure [ fig - oiiha ] where we plot the strength of the two lines against each other .",
    "it can be seen that given the  error bars all points are consistent with a reasonable linear correlation .",
    "kennicutt ( 1992 ) estimates the line ratio @xmath46 $ ] as having a median value of about 2 ( with a spread from 1 to 3 ) for a sample of local star - forming galaxies ( 1.0 mag mean extinction ) .",
    "our observed values at high - redshift are entirely consistent with kennicutt s median and spread , implying we too have small amounts of extinction which agrees with our findings below in section  [ sec - sfrz1 ] .",
    "the points with zero  are consistent with detected [ oii ] given the larger error bars .",
    "note the line ratios are also good evidence that our aperture corrections are reasonable , if omitted we would obtain a much lower ratio @xmath46=1 $ ] .",
    "using models of population synthesis it is possible to calculate the relation between input star - formation rates and output uv and fluxes .",
    "the basic principle is that the uv light is dominated by short - lived main sequence stars ( the  light is reprocessed ionising uv ) so the number of them in a galaxy is proportional to the star - formation rate .",
    "the prescription for this calculation is simple . for reference",
    "we outline it ( and the corresponding assumptions ) in detail :    1 .   for a given time - dependent star - formation rate",
    "the population synthesis code gives the uv stellar spectrum as a function of time .",
    "note that kennicutt ( 1983 ) in deriving his calibration uses a simple grid of stars of different masses with evolutionary tracks current at the time . 2 .   for the uv continuum estimators one takes an averaged flux ( e.g. through a synthetic box filter ) at a specific wavelength ( e.g. 1500 , 2800 )",
    "at the longer wavelengths , with increasing stellar lifetimes , the conversion from a constant star - formation rate to a uv flux is age - dependent ( see for example pettini  who uses different factors at 1500  for @xmath47 and @xmath48 years ) .",
    "one then also needs to apply corrections for dust attenuation and/or lyman absorption by line of sight systems ( e.g. madau 1995 ) .",
    "3 .   for  one calculates the number of ionising lyman continuum photons .",
    "this flux comes from the most short lived stars radiating at @xmath49  with lifetimes of @xmath50 myr",
    ". then it is assumed all this radiation is absorbed by intervening hydrogen gas in the galaxy in which the forming stars are embedded and that none leaks out . in practice it seems this is very close to the truth . at very high - redshift",
    "the lyman limit can be observed in the optical ( e.g. the steidel  galaxies ) and the flux does indeed go to zero , but as these galaxies are identified by the lyman breaks this could be a selection effect . for local galaxies there have been limited @xmath49  spectroscopy , for example leitherer ( 1995 ) observed a sample of 4 starburst galaxies with the hopkins ultraviolet telescope and concluded that @xmath51 of the ionising photons escaped . constrained models of the ionising radiation field of the milky way ( bland - hawthorn & maloney 1997 , 1998 ) indicate that approximately 5% may escape",
    "the ionising photons are reprocessed into recombination lines , and the relative strengths can be calculated in detail .",
    "hummer & storey ( 1987 ) calculate 0.45  photons are emitted per lyman continuum photon for case b recombination .",
    "this number is quite robust , over a range of nebulosity conditions ( @xmath52k , @xmath53 electrons @xmath54 ) .    as there are a number of values for these conversion factors in the literature we thought it would be useful for reference purposes to systematically tabulate these for a set of models .",
    "this also serves to illustrate the range of variations and trends .",
    "the results of our calculations are given in table  [ tab - conversions ] for uv 1500 , 2800  and  conversions .",
    "the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 , 1996 ) models ( ` bc96 ' ) offer a range of metallicities ( albeit using theoretical model atmospheres  the ` kl96 ' models ) .",
    "the pegase models ( fioc  1997 ) offer two sets of post - main sequence evolutionary tracks but only solar metallicity .",
    "both sets of models offer several stellar initial mass functions ( imfs ) ; we tabulate the results using the imfs of salpeter ( 1955 ) and scalo ( 1986 ) because these bracket the upper and lower limits of the variation .",
    "we also tabulate some other values given previously in the literature",
    ".    for all these models  reaches a constant asymptote after 20 myr , then stays constant to within a 510% out to 10 gyr .",
    "thus it can be used as a tracer of the instantaneous star - formation rate on time - scales of order @xmath5510 myr . for reference",
    "we give the value at 100 myr .",
    "the conversion is very sensitive to the imf , as the ionising flux comes from the most massive stars , with salpeter giving a value 2.83.4 @xmath9 higher than scalo for the different models .",
    "another important point , which has not been remarked upon in the literature discussing high-@xmath56 galaxies , is the strong effect of metallicity below 912 .",
    "this occurs in the stellar evolutionary models because the most luminous stars ( contributing below 912 ) , have a much greater dependence of effective temperature on metallicity than the less luminous stars contributing at longer wavelengths .",
    "the effect of the hotter stars at low metallicty is to raise the  flux about 1.7 @xmath9 compared to the solar metallicity value for a given star - formation rate .",
    "the average uv luminosity per unit hz is computed as the total energy integrated through a @xmath23 10% box filter divided by the total bandwidth .",
    "this gives a negligible colour term .",
    "for a 10% filter the difference in the average between a constant @xmath57 spectrum ( which approximates these spectra for @xmath58 ) and a much redder constant @xmath59 spectrum is only 1% .",
    "the imf dependence is somewhat less than for  ( typically a factor of 1.52.5 ) as these uv bands come from less massive stars and the metallicity dependence on temperature is much smaller .",
    "however there is a stronger time dependence , with the flux increasing significantly between @xmath47 and @xmath60 years , especially at 2800  and for the scalo imf which is much less rich in massive stars .",
    "for cosmological times ( @xmath61 gyr ) the 1500  flux is relatively insensitive to time as noted by madau  ( 1998 ) ( except for the extreme 0.02 solar metallicity case ) .",
    "thus it can be used as a tracer of the star - formation rate on time - scales of 1 gyr .",
    "the 2800  flux is not as stable and changes at the 1040% level over 110 gyr .",
    "there are further @xmath62 variations in the exact conversion depending on the model and metallicity assumed .",
    "these time and metallicity effects are illustrated graphically in figure  [ fig - uvspec ] .",
    "finally it is worth noting that the range in the _ ratio _ of @xmath63 to uv is less than the absolute range ; as both come from high - mass stars the choice of imf matters somewhat less .",
    "turning back to our data we can do a direct galaxy by galaxy comparison of the star - formation rates inferred from uv and .",
    "our uv fluxes are particularly robust because for redshifts near unity the rest frame 2800  light corresponds very closely to the observed frame @xmath43-band light . to a first approximation",
    "we can simply ignore the k - correction and derive the 2800  flux directly from the cfrs @xmath43-magnitudes .",
    "we refine this slightly by using the sed fits from lilly  ( 1996 ) ; this corrects the fluxes by 1020% .",
    "thus the uv luminosities we use are the same as the raw data which goes into the @xmath1 star - formation rate determinations of madau ( for @xmath64 this was based on the cfrs luminosity density functions of lilly  1996 ) we use a formal error bar of 20% for our uv fluxes to give errors representative of the @xmath43 photometric errors and the k - corrections .",
    "we plot the  vs uv luminosities in figure  [ fig - havsuv ] and overlay lines for a set of conversions from table  [ tab - conversions ] .",
    "note these are only valid for a continuous , constant star - formation rate  the more complex problem of bursts is considered below in section  [ sec - models ] .",
    "it is clear from the plot that there is a order - of - magnitude agreement in the star - formation rates derived from the two methods and a reasonable correlation , i.e. strong uv systems are usually strong  systems .",
    "there are no galaxies with an extremely large excess of  relative to uv , which would occur if the star - formation was highly obscured by dust .",
    "we do find points with zero  flux and appreciable uv flux , which we would expect to detect within the measurement errors if there was a linear correlation .",
    "this can not be due to dust as the latter can only enhance the  ratio not diminish it . as noted in section  [ sec - completeness ] , these spectra are detected , they just do not contain significant .",
    "one physical effect that will explain this is the relative lifetimes of stars contributing to the uv and  as mentioned in section  [ sec - sfrmethods ] .",
    "when one moves away from the simple scenario of constant star - formation rate the picture changes considerably .",
    "for example for a instantaneous starburst the  flux will drop to effectively zero after 30 myr while significant uv flux will persist up to 1000 myr .",
    "this will produce low  points such as are seen in our sample .",
    "should be present in _ all our galaxies _ because they are known to have [ oii ] emission ( see section  [ sec - completeness ] ) , however the ratio will scatter more widely and it is certainly possible for  to be below our detection limit despite significant [ oii ] and uv emission . to quantify these effects",
    "requires us to develop a proper model for starburst activity in galaxies .",
    "we do this below in section  [ sec - models ] .",
    "nevertheless when one averages over many galaxies the effect of bursts should cancel out in the mean  the continuous star - formation conversions of table  [ tab - conversions ] should be applicable for an _ ensemble _ of galaxies .",
    "( this approximation is tested below using the methods developed in section  [ sec - models ] and is found to accurate to @xmath65 , even for this small sample . )",
    "it can be seen that the values scatter about a ratio of 23 times as much star - formation inferred from the  as uv .",
    "this is balanced to some extent by the zero points . by summing over _ all _ the galaxies we find the following relation between the luminosity per comoving volume in and uv : @xmath66 in the units as in the last column of table  [ tab - conversions ] .",
    "this ratio is plotted as the dotted line in figure  [ fig - havsuv ] .",
    "the ratio is somewhat lower that those predicted by the models which give values in the range 414 for 0.2 - 2.5 solar metallicities . what can cause this discrepancy ?",
    "it is too large to be encompassed by our range of metallicities ; one can boost the  ratio if we assume a younger age than @xmath67 gyr .",
    "however changing to @xmath68 gyr only increases the slopes of the solid lines in figure  [ fig - havsuv ] by @xmath69 ; we could achieve the observed slope if star - formation is only @xmath70 gyr old in all the detected galaxies but this would be unlikely simply due to random sampling  the redshift range of the sample corresponds to a timespan of @xmath71 gyr at @xmath1 .",
    "the most likely explanation for the discrepancy is the presence of dust attenuating the ultraviolet light .",
    "if we adopt fiducial model values of ( 10.9 , 6.3 ) for ( scalo , salpeter ) for solar metallicity , which agree well between pegase and bc96 models ( kl96 tracks ) , the ratio of  to uv inferred star - formation rates are ( 3.5 , 2.0 ) . using pei ( 1992 ) extinction formulae ( a standard dust - screen model )",
    "we then derive a mean sample @xmath72 of ( 1.0 , 0.5 ) mags for the smc law , ( 1.1,0.6 ) for the galactic law .",
    "these extinction values are entirely consistent with what is found from studies of star - formation from balmer lines in local normal sab galaxies .",
    "for example kennicutt ( 1983 ) found @xmath73 mags and a study of low redshift @xmath74 cfrs galaxies using the @xmath75 line ratios by tresse and maddox ( 1998 ) found the same value .",
    "calzetti ( 1994 ) and calzetti ( 1997 ) have proposed an empirical dust - attenuation law for heavily reddened starbursts ( @xmath76 mags ) . in this model",
    "the nebular lines have about twice the optical depth as the stellar continuum ; moreover although the lines are well described by a standard galactic screen law the stellar continuum is empirically described by a greyer law in which the dust and stars are intermixed . using the calzetti law we derive @xmath72 attenuations of ( 2.6 , 1.4 ) mags ( for stars ; @xmath77 for nebulae ) ; because the attenutations of the and 2800  continuum are more similar than for the screen models a much higher obscuration is required to match the observed excesses : attenuations of ( 2.9 , 1.6 ) mags result for  and ( 4.2 , 2.3 ) mags for 2800  stellar continuum .",
    "it should be noted however that it is still not established that corrections derived for the balmer lines in starburst regions of nearby galaxies are appropriate to the integrated light of the distant galaxies studied here .",
    "this question remains open .",
    "we can now examine the total correction for dust in both the  and uv determined star - formation rates .",
    "the milky way law gives corrections for ( scalo , salpeter ) imfs of @xmath78 for and ( 8.0,3.1 ) for the uv .",
    "these numbers are the same to within @xmath79 for the smc extinction law ; this is because the two extinction curves differ most strongly in the uv at @xmath80 ( e.g. at the 2175  dust feature ) and in the near - uv and optical they are very similar .",
    "the calzetti law of course gives much larger values : the final star - formation rates are an additional factor of @xmath81 higher for the scalo imf and @xmath82 higher for the salpeter imf .",
    "finally we can compare the star - formation rate of our @xmath20 cfrs galaxies with local counterparts .",
    "we adopt the salpeter imf as that is conventionally used for deriving the local rates . for the range of dust corrections",
    "we have derived we obtain rates of @xmath8360  yr@xmath4 , comparable to local starbursts ( e.g. calzetti 1997 ) and much greater than the typical 4 yr@xmath4 found for local normal spirals ( kennicutt 1983 ) and the milky way ( smith  1978 ) .",
    "as noted earlier the interpretation of  and uv luminosities as star - formation rates becomes more complicated if non - constant star - formation histories are assumed . for this reason we developed a mathematical frame - work for exploring this and to see",
    "how well we could reproduce the observed distribution .",
    "the principles are based upon maximum likelihood and are a 2d generalisation of the methods developed by abraham  1999 for colour - colour fitting . for a given star - formation history we can run a spectral evolution code and calculate  and uv luminosity as a function of time using the methods of section  [ sec - sfrmethods ] .",
    "we evolve the models for 5 gyr and sample at random times ( we can do this because all the galaxies are at similar redshift ) to create a 2d model distribution of light in the the @xmath84 plane .",
    "the code then computes the likelihood of drawing the observational data from the model :    @xmath85    where the observational @xmath86 points are @xmath87 with errors @xmath88 , and the model points have probability density @xmath89 .",
    "the star - formation histories are parameterised and likelihood space is explored to find the maximum likelihood .",
    "we use an adaptive algorithm where a large parameter space is explored with a coarse parameter grid to locate the peak and the region around the peak is then examined with a finer grid to give confidence limits on the fitted parameters from @xmath90 .",
    "once we have the best fit parameters for a model , we can then create simulated observational datasets .",
    "this is done 1000 times , the maximum likelihood fit being recomputed each time , this allows us to normalise our relative likelihood into an absolute probability of the observed data given the model .",
    "we parameterised the star - formation histories as continuous star - formation , with galaxy to galaxy scatter , plus a random distribution of bursts .",
    "initially the total star - formation rate is kept constant and normalised to the values derived in section  [ sec - sfrz1 ] .",
    "this is a good approximation as an ensemble of galaxies undergoing bursts will approximate continuous star - formation and results in one less free parameter . for our further analysis",
    "we confine ourselves to the bc96 models ( solar metallicity , ` kl96 ' atmospheres ) and the salpeter imf ( as the latter gives better results for fitting the star - formation histories , colours and mass@xmath24light ratios of galaxies , see for example kennicutt ( 1983 ) madau  1998 , calzetti 1997 , lilly  1996 ) .",
    "we correct all @xmath86 points using the @xmath91 mags milky way law derived in section  [ sec - sfrz1 ] ; the effect of adopting the calzetti law is just a simple scaling to globally @xmath92 higher star - formation rates and does not affect the details of the analysis .    to start with we modeled a simple continuous star - formation model to check our code was giving sensible results . to make it more realistic we introduced a scatter , @xmath93 , between galaxies following a normal distribution ( slightly corrected to avoid negative star - formation rates ) .",
    "the best fit results are shown in figure  [ fig - modelbursts ] as a likelihood contour plot overlayed on the model points .",
    "for comparison we also show a simulated set of data points drawn from the model distribution .",
    "it can be seen that some scatter is introduced ; this originates physically from the time variation of uv light even for constant star - formation .",
    "the best fit parameter values are shown in table  [ tab - likepars ]  the model is a very bad fit to the distribution of data .",
    "one might ask if the scatter could be explained by variation in extinction between galaxies . while it is possible",
    "this can explain some of the variation it can not explain the points with large amounts of uv emission and small amounts of  emission .",
    "this is because dust quenches the uv much more than the   precisely the opposite effect to that sought .",
    "we next explored the effects of starbursts to see if these could plausibly explain the observed distribution .",
    "initially we tried fixed - mass bursts , then we tried a scheme for allowing the burst masses to vary .",
    "since we could find little information in the literature as to an appropriate mass function to adopt for bursts we invented our own simple phenomenological scheme : bursts are parameterised by a mean mass ( @xmath94 ) and standard deviation ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the distribution is assumed to be normal .",
    "while this has no physical basis it only has 2 parameters and at least allows us to investigate the effects of mass distributions . @xmath94 and our global star - formation rate normalisation fixes the mean interval between bursts .",
    "finally we have @xmath96 the fraction of the star - formation occurring in bursts .",
    "for the form of the bursts we consider two cases ( modeled after bc96 ) : a constant burst of length @xmath97 and exponential bursts of e - folding time @xmath98    the results of this exercise is shown in table  [ tab - likepars ] .",
    "it can be seen that the burst models provide much better fits than the the continuous models .",
    "the monte - carlo realisations show that the latter generate data sets like the observed one only about 1% of the time .",
    "this is because the continuous star - formation can not generate enough variation in the  ratio .",
    "the burst models are much better and generate synthetic points which look like the data @xmath9920% of the time .",
    "this is because the variation in the star - formation rate is the principle cause of variation in the ratio .",
    "allowing the burst mass to vary improves the fit only slightly , we conclude that our data does not constrain the shape of the burst mass function significantly .",
    "the best fit burst fraction is @xmath71 , indicating the burst mode is preferred .",
    "the results are illustrated graphically in the lower two rows of figure  [ fig - modelbursts ] which compares the dust - corrected observational data with model realisations for a sample of key models .",
    "the likelihood contours of the main parameters are also shown .",
    "the best fit mass of a typical burst is 25@xmath100 , corresponding to a time interval between bursts of typically @xmath101300 myr and the characteristic time @xmath97 is of @xmath102200 myr .",
    "this mean the bursts usually overlap in time .",
    "these values are similar to what one might expect intuitively based on the data : the chance of catching a galaxy in the  quiescent stage has to be of order @xmath103 to reproduce the fraction of points seen with uv but no .",
    "we note that this kind of ` continuous but episodic ' star - formation with several bursts per gyr is of the same form as that found in local starburst galaxies by calzetti ( 1997 ) .",
    "our average star - formation rates are of the same order too . in between bursts the star - formation rate and  flux does indeed drop close to zero while the uv persists ( see figure  [ fig - modeltime ] which shows a sample time - dependence ) due to the stellar lifetime effects mentioned in section  [ sec - sfrmethods ] .",
    "thus the zero  points in our data ( given the error bars ) are naturally explained .    finally with these tools we were able to test",
    "how well an ensemble of galaxies converged to approximating a continuous star - formation rate , as assumed in section  [ sec - sfrz1 ] . to do this",
    "we re - ran the likelihood fitting , this time fitting for the total star - formation rate as a free parameter .",
    "the results of this gave rates of between 19 and 23  yr@xmath4 per galaxy , which agrees well with the value of 20  yr@xmath4 calculated in section  [ sec - sfrz1 ] for the same salpeter imf .",
    "while these simple models could do with some elaboration to obtain a better fit , we are near the limit of what can be inferred from 13 data points .",
    "it is clear this sort of detailed approach will benefit greatly from future observations and much larger samples .",
    "six of the galaxies in our sample have morphological information from our programme of _ hubble space telescope _",
    "high - resolution imaging of cfrs and ldss2 high - redshift galaxies ( brinchmann 1998 , lilly , 1998 ) .",
    "this is obviously an even more limited sample , but we can look qualitatively at the dependence of star - formation rate on galaxy type .",
    "the classifications are listed in table  [ tab - observations ] and postage stamps of the galaxies are shown in figure  [ fig - postage ] .",
    "there are 3 galaxies classified as ` peculiar ' .",
    "all have detected  emission and blue colours ( @xmath104 ) and one ( 14.0600 ) has the highest star - formation rate in our sample .",
    "two of these are classed as ` mergers ' and one as a close pair indicating an association between star - formation and interaction .",
    "there are two galaxies classed as compact. both of these are also blue ( @xmath105 ) and it is interesting to note that while one has quiescent  and strong uv the other has a large  excess ( 3.2 )",
    ". finally we have 03.0316 a red spiral ( @xmath106 ) which is quiescent in both uv and .",
    "finally we note that galaxies with star - formation , whether inferred through  or uv , have the bluest @xmath44 colours ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "this is not in contradiction with the modest extinction values derived in section  [ sec - sfrz1 ]  an extinction of @xmath91 mags would only redden the observed @xmath44 ( rest @xmath107 ) by a small 0.4 mags whereas the difference between and old and young stellar population is of order 23 mags .",
    "there are now enough measurements of balmer line star - formation rates at high and low redshift to construct the first star - formation history of the universe in balmer light to compare with the previous uv measurements . for consistency",
    "we use the salpeter imf , @xmath6 , @xmath7 throughout .",
    "all points are re - derived from their original luminosity densities in a consistent manner using the uv ,  factors in table  [ tab - conversions ] for bc96 ( kl96 ) with solar metallicity .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig - balmer - sfrz ] .",
    "the point at @xmath13 comes from the gallego  ( 1995 ) local objective prism survey and is based on .",
    "tresse and maddox ( 1998 ) have measured the luminosity function at @xmath108 from the cfrs , at which point is still available in the optical cfrs spectra .",
    "they find a value a factor of two higher than the uv measurements .",
    "our  measurements are used to derive a new value for the star - formation rate density in the cfrs at @xmath1 .",
    "this is higher by a factor of 3.1@xmath9 than the uv point . at @xmath109",
    "we show the point derived from the work of pettini , who used cgs4 to measure the  line in 5 of steidel s galaxies .",
    "they infer star - formation rates 0.7 - 7 times higher than derived from the uv at 1500  rest and typical extinctions @xmath1102 mags .",
    "we show this as a factor of 3 above the uv point . as well as the balmer lines we also plot the point of hughes  based on sub - mm observations and the points of flores  ( 1998 ) from far - infrared iso observations .",
    "it should be noted though that the derivation of the latter are qualitatively different from the balmer line and uv measurements : the far - ir and sub - mm bands measure uv reprocessed by dust into thermal radiation and hence they are sensitive to galaxies which might not appear at all in the optical .",
    "moreover the hughes  points are based on an _ assumed _ redshift distributions for sources which have not yet been verified and has been disputed ( richards 1999 ) .",
    "finally it is also worth noting that the hughes , connolly  and madau  points are all based on the same patch of sky , the hubble deep field north ( williams 1996 ) , which may not be representative .",
    "it can be however seen that the general trend is for the balmer line and iso / sub - mm measurements to find values several times higher than the uv continuum at all redshifts .",
    "the rise to @xmath1 is preserved , arguably the fall off at @xmath111 is preserved though given the random errors and the systematics in the dust correction no change for @xmath112 would also be consistent with the data . whether star - formation peaks at intermediate redshift ( @xmath12 ) or continues to high redshifts ( @xmath113 ) is an important test of heirarchical formation scenarios ( e.g. baugh  1998 ) . from the current data",
    "the question must remain open .",
    "the agreement between the far - ir / sub - mm measurements and balmer measurements is particularly impressive since both attempt to compensate for dust in different ways .",
    "flores find an upward dust correction of @xmath114 at @xmath1 and extinctions of @xmath80.9 mags , both consistent with our best estimates .",
    "it should be noted that independent iso observations of the hubble deep field north by rowan - robinson  ( 1997 ) give a conflicting value several times higher than flores ; however the latter is derived from a 19@xmath9 larger area of sky and so is probably better determined .",
    "an important point is that the dust corrections are not many times _ larger _ than we have found .",
    "larger corrections ( e.g. @xmath115 ) have been argued for by authors such as meurer  ( 1997 ) based on amounts of obscuration in powerful starburst galaxies locally .",
    "however it is not clear that the local massive starburst galaxies ( e.g. arp 220 ) are the right analogs of the higher redshift field galaxies .",
    "when lower luminosity starburst galaxies are studied locally they prove much less obscured ( e.g. buat & burgarella 1998 ) , these systems are comparable in extinction to local spirals and the sample studied here . we note though if we use the dust correction from the calzetti law the point at @xmath1 moves up still further to @xmath116 above the uv point .",
    "this is because if our galaxies are similar to those studied by calzetti the hii regions suffer additional obscuration relative to the stellar continuum .",
    "this higher value would then agree with the iso observations of rowan - robinson .",
    "however the resulting high star - formation rates may be problematic in that the stellar density produced in the local universe might be too high ( madau  1998 ) .",
    "from a sample of 13 galaxies observed with cgs4 we have performed the first  measurements of the star - formation rate at @xmath1 .",
    "we conclude the following :    1 .",
    "the  measurements show a star - formation rate at least three times as high as that inferred from the 2800  continuum luminosity by madau  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the typical dust extinction derived using standard extinction laws is only moderate ( @xmath81.0 mags ) and very similar to that inferred in low redshift field galaxies .",
    "if there is a large population of obscured star - forming systems at @xmath1 they are not common in known samples  their rate of occurrence in the cfrs at @xmath1 must be @xmath117 or they would be detected in our data .",
    "this limit is similar to the results of pettini  for the @xmath10 steidel galaxies and consistent with deep sub - mm observations which estimate that massive obscured star - forming systems make up approximately 10% of high - redshift galaxies",
    "( lilly  1998b ) .",
    "a cautionary note is the nature of the dust extinction law : if we follow the calzetti attenuation prescription we imply much higher obscuration of the  line and a star - formation rate at @xmath1 three times higher still .",
    "it is unclear however whether such a large correction should be applied to the integrated light of _ all _ galaxies at high - redshift .",
    "this issue can only be resolved by further direct measurement of the @xmath118 decrement in these galaxies and the derivation of the extinction to the nebular regions independent of the stellar uv flux .",
    "the mean star - formation rate of a @xmath1 cfrs galaxy is @xmath8360 yr@xmath4 ( for salpeter imf and the range of dust laws we have studied ) , which is enough to make such a @xmath119 galaxy in a few gyr .",
    "this is a factor of several higher than ordinary spiral galaxies of comparable luminosity today .",
    "the large scatter in the distribution of  to uv light is much better fit by a model in which star - formation occurs in episodic bursts with intervals of @xmath1200.3 gyr and of length @xmath1210.2 gyr .",
    "pure continuous star - formation is strongly ruled out , even with variable extinction , as a sole explanation .",
    "we find qualitative trends for star - forming systems to have blue colours and peculiar morphology ( especially interactions ) . 7 .",
    "the star - formation history of the universe , as inferred from the balmer lines , is qualitatively similar to that inferred from the uv but corrected upwards by factors of at least 23 at all redshifts .",
    "although the overall form of a rise to @xmath1 is preserved , a compilation of dust - insensitive data does not yet demonstrate with certainty whether there is a turnover beyond @xmath1 .",
    "finally , it is clear that the era of detailed spectral studies of high - redshift galaxies is upon us , made possible by the advent of intermediate to high - resolution spectrographs on 4 m telescopes . in the next few years with larger samples and better near - ir spectrographs on 8 m class telescopes ( many with the ability to spatially resolve spectra in 2d ) it will be possible to model the spectral evolution of the high - redshift galaxy population in much greater details . in particular the field will be able to focus much more on detailed astrophysics ( stellar / dust / gas compositions , star - formation rates , dynamics , etc . ) rather than simple statistics .",
