    "manganese - based pyrochlore compounds such as tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 , form an interesting class of compounds which despite having similar colossal magneto - resistive ( cmr ) effect exhibit markedly different features compared to that of manganites .",
    "in contrast to manganites , these compounds are not mixed - valent , do not have any appreciable jahn - teller distortion @xcite and seemingly show metallic behavior @xcite both below and above the magnetic transition temperature t@xmath2 ( @xmath3 140 k ) .",
    "concerning the metallic behavior above t@xmath4 though , it is not totally clear whether it is a good metal or more like a bad metal or an insulator - like compound which arises due to difficulties related to sample preparation and defects present in the paramagnetic phase . though the original data by shimakawa et .",
    "@xcite suggests the metallic behavior above t@xmath2 , the optical conductivity data@xcite and and photoemission and x - ray absorption@xcite near edge spectroscopy point towards an insulator - like behavior in the paramagnetic regime .",
    "these non - manganite like features rule out the generally applicable double exchange mechanism or polaronic mechanism as the driving mechanism of ferromagnetism in this class of compound , and remained a mystery for quite some time . in absence of double exchange mechanism ,",
    "a strong contestant for the driving mechanism is the mn - o - mn mediated superexchange mechanism , particularly since mn - o - mn form an angle @xcite of 133@xmath5 , significantly smaller than 180@xmath5 .",
    "this is however contradicted by the experimental findings that the ferromagnetic t@xmath2 gets suppressed by application of pressure @xcite and gets enhanced by moderate amount of introduction of nonmagnetic ion like sb in place of mn @xcite .",
    "employing n - th order muffin tin orbital ( mto ) based nmto - downfolding technique@xcite , we have recently established  @xcite that driving mechanism of ferromagnetism in this class of compounds is neither super - exchange or double - exchange , nor any exotic mechanism with nearest neighbor ( nn ) antiferromagnetic ( afm ) coupling dominated by long - ranged ferromagnetic ( fm ) interaction@xcite , but a kinetic energy assisted mechanism similar to that of double perovskite compounds like sr@xmath0femoo@xmath6 , sr@xmath0fereo@xmath6@xcite and mn - doped gaas@xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we give a detail account of the doping effect and the pressure effect from the electronic structure point of view , which lend further support to the existence of the proposed kinetic energy driven mechanism in these compounds .",
    "while the changes that happen in the crystal structure upon doping is clear , the situation is rather ambiguous in case of application of pressure .",
    "the initial measurement hinted to a decrease in mn - o - mn bond angle @xcite alongwith the compression of mn - o bondlength .",
    "however the subsequent measurement @xcite indicated an increase in mn - o - mn bond angle which was used in terms of super exchange mechanism to explain the decrease in t@xmath2 . in view of these conflicting claims",
    ", we also take the opportunity to theoretically address the effect of pressure on the structure of tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 and its implication on magnetism by detailed electronic structure calculations together with structural relaxations under pressure .    the rest of the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "section ii deals with various methodologies that have been employed to compute the crystallographic structure ( in case of tl@xmath7mn@xmath7o@xmath8 under pressure ) and to compute and analyze the subsequent electronic structure of tl@xmath7mn@xmath7o@xmath8 under doping and pressure . in section iii",
    ", we present our results .",
    "this section is divided into several subsections . in section iiia ,",
    "the electronic structure of pristine tl@xmath7mn@xmath7o@xmath8 is presented and the proposed kinetic energy driven mechanism is introduced as a reference , which will form the basis of discussion in the following .",
    "section iiib is devoted to tl@xmath7mn@xmath7o@xmath8 under pressure , while section iiic is devoted to sb - doped tl@xmath7mn@xmath7o@xmath8 .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper with a summary presented in section iv .",
    "we have investigated the electronic structure of pure tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 , tl@xmath0mn@xmath9sb@xmath10o@xmath1 and tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 under pressure by the tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto)@xcite method , computed within the framework of the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) of the density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "the employed basis set , consisted of tl-@xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 states , mn-@xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 states , and o-@xmath17 and @xmath18 states .",
    "three different classes of empty spheres were used to fill up the space .",
    "the self - consistent calculations were performed on a bz mesh of 12@xmath1912@xmath1912 .",
    "the computed band structures were analyzed and interpreted in terms of nmto - downfolding technique @xcite .",
    "the nmto technique , introduced and implemented in recent years , goes beyond the scope of standard lmto technique by defining an energetically accurate basis with consistent description throughout the space involving both the mt spheres and the interstitial . as important feature of this technique",
    "is the energy - selective downfolding procedure where one integrates out degrees of freedom and keeps only few degrees of freedom active to define a few - orbital , low - energy hamiltonian .",
    "the effective nmtos defining such hamiltonian , serve as the wannier or wannier - like function corresponding to the selected low - energy bands .    for the calculation of the exchange interaction strengths , j , a supercell involving a sixteen mn atoms was constructed which amounts to enlarging the original unit cell by four times .",
    "this was achieved by replacing the original face centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice by the simple cubic lattice with four times as many atoms as that in fcc .",
    "the basic structural unit of mn sublattice is the mn@xmath20 tetrahedra which share corners to form an infinite 3d lattice .",
    "we calculated the lsda total energies by considering different magnetic configurations of this sublattice . in total , six spin configurations have been chosen .",
    "one of the six configurations was fm and the other five were afm .",
    "the details of the spin configurations chosen are as given in table i in ref@xcite . the total energies are then mapped on to an effective heisenberg hamiltonian formed by the mn@xmath21 spins . the hamiltonian considered till the 3nn(third nearest neighbor ) interactions is : @xmath22 where s@xmath23 denoted the spin-3/2 operator corresponding to the mn @xmath21 spins at the site i , and _",
    "j@xmath24,j@xmath0 _ and _ j@xmath25 _ denote the nn , 2nn(second nearest neighbor ) and 3nn magnetic exchange interaction strengths .",
    "since we have restricted ourselves to only five afm configurations amongst many possible afm configurations , we computed seven different estimates of these j s along with their standard deviations employing set of three energy differences chosen out of total five different energy differences .",
    "this limitation can be overcome by taking as many afm spin configurations as practically possible .",
    "the mean - field estimate of t@xmath4 is given by @xmath26 where _",
    "j@xmath27 _ , is the net effective magnetic exchange interaction , given by @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "k@xmath30 is the boltzman constant and @xmath31 are the number of nn , 2nn and 3nn mn pairs . for undoped tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 , @xmath32 = 6 , @xmath33 = 12 and @xmath34 = 12 .",
    "however , these numbers change in case of doped calculations where some of the mn atoms gets replaced by the nonmagnetic sb ion and therefore do not contribute in the calculation of magnetic energy .",
    "the application of mean - field theory is naturally expected to overestimate the t@xmath4 .",
    "use of monte carlo simulation @xcite or green function method @xcite can give better estimates and agreements with experimentally measured values .",
    "one needs to keep this in mind when comparisons are being made with the measured t@xmath4 in the following sections .",
    "tl@xmath7mn@xmath7o@xmath8 occurs in cubic , face - centered lattice with @xmath35 space group and two formula unit in the cell.@xcite there are two types of oxygen , o and o. while o oxygen provide the octahedral surrounding of the mn atom which corner share to give rise to a geometry of a closed ring or cage , o atoms form nearest neighbor bonds with tl giving rise to tl@xmath0o complex running through the cage like geometry as shown in left panel of fig .",
    "1 . the structural parameters for the pristine tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 , and sb - doped tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 have been taken as the experimentally determined structure published in literature @xcite . however , as mentioned already , the structural information for tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 under pressure is somewhat controversial which calls for structural optimization . for this purpose ,",
    "we have adopted the pseudopotential method@xcite as implemented in the vasp@xcite code .",
    "we have employed the pseudopotentials generated by the projector - augmented wave ( paw)@xcite method .",
    "wavefunctions have been expanded in terms of plane waves with a cut off energy of 400 ev .",
    "k_-mesh of 6@xmath196@xmath196 was employed to perform the self - consistent calculations . in tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "tl , mn , o and o atoms occupy the wyckoff positions , 16d , 16c , 8b and 48f respectively . among these",
    "only the positions given by 48f contain the internal parameter,_u_. this parameter _ u _ defines the @xmath36mn - o - mn ( see right panel of fig.[structure ] ) . as _",
    "_ increases , the @xmath36mn - o - mn decreases and vice versa .",
    "when pressure is applied , it needs to be investigated whether the _ u _ parameter also varies along with the reduction in the bondlengths .",
    "if at all it changes , it has to be ascertained in what way it does so . in our calculation , the o position is relaxed by varying _ u _ , in order to find out the variation of total energy with angle formed between mn , o and mn atoms . in order to obtain the theoretical ground state , cohesive properties and estimate the pressure , murnaghan@xcite equation of state has been employed to fit the lsda total energies .",

    "right panels give the spin - polarized total ( black ) , tl-6s ( red ) , mn-3d ( green ) , o-2p ( orange ) and o-2p ( blue ) density of states .",
    "upper and the lower figures correspond to the majority and minority spin contributions respectively in both the panels .",
    "bars on the right signify the energy range for which various characters dominate.,width=321 ]    the lsda electronic structure of ferromagnetically ordered tl@xmath7mn@xmath7o@xmath8 , computed with tb - lmto method is shown in fig.[bands+dos ] .",
    "this figure shows both the band structure and the orbital projected density of states ( dos ) .",
    "consistent with the nominal valence of o@xmath42 and mn@xmath43 , oxygen dominated states are totally occupied , while the crystal field split mn @xmath44 states are occupied in the majority spin channel and close to empty in the minority spin channel .",
    "mn @xmath45 states consistent with @xmath46 configuration of mn , remain empty in both the spin channels .",
    "tl bands , consistent with tl@xmath47 nominal valence also remain almost empty .",
    "however , interestingly in the majority spin channel , the tl-6s state mixed with o-2p states overlap with mn @xmath45 manifold spanning an energy range of about 2 - 4 ev@xcite , while in the minority spin channel , they overlap with nearly empty mn @xmath44 dominated states , which give rise to highly dispersive band in bottom of this manifold , crossing the fermi level , e@xmath41 , as seen in lower , left panel of fig.[bands+dos ] .",
    "this hints to a large spin - splitting at the tl site .",
    "this is unusual in the sense , one would normally expect tl to be essentially nonmagnetic with tiny spin splitting . this unusual feature plays the key role in providing the understanding of the driving mechanism of ferromagnetism in tl@xmath7mn@xmath7o@xmath8 .",
    "this has been explained in detail in ref@xcite .",
    "as has been shown in ref@xcite , the unhybridized effective tl - o level is positioned in between the spin - split mn @xmath44 states and on turning on the hybridization , it induces a renormalized spin - splitting within the tl - o level which is directed in a opposite way compared to the spin - splitting at the mn site .",
    "this happens due to pushing up of the tl - o spin - up state and pushing down of the tl - o spin - down states , driven by coupling with the mn @xmath44 states of the same symmetry .",
    "the energy gain contributed by this hybridization induced negative spin polarization of the otherwise nonmagnetic element , is the central concept in this novel mechanism .",
    "this mechanism ensures a specific spin orientation between the localized mn @xmath44 spins and the mobile carrier formed by the hybridized renormalized state , which in turn aligns the spins in mn sublattice . this is a general mechanism and found to be operative in case of a number of compounds like sr@xmath0femoo@xmath6 , sr@xmath0fereo@xmath6@xcite , mn - doped gaas@xcite and cucr@xmath7s@xmath20@xcite etc .    in the following subsections",
    ", we will present a detail account of the changes in the electronic structure and the variation in t@xmath2 of tl@xmath7mn@xmath7o@xmath8 with doping and under pressure .",
    "we will argue that the counter - intuitive variation in t@xmath2 has its origin in the modified electronic structure and follows naturally from the framework of proposed hybridization induced mechanism of ferromagnetism as was established in ref@xcite and reviewed in the above .",
    "as explained before , to investigate tl@xmath7mn@xmath7o@xmath8 under pressure one needs to first settle the issues related to crystal structure . to be precise ,",
    "does applied pressure increase or decrease or not alter the @xmath36mn - o - mn ? for this purpose , we have carried out a series of structural optimization calculations with pseudopotential method @xcite . at",
    "first the cohesive properties were calculated within lsda .",
    "following the recent claim@xcite that application of on - site u can also influence the cohesive properties of transition metal oxides , we have repeated our calculations also with lsda+u functional .",
    "lsda total energy vs volume calculation , shown in fig.[bulk ] , has a minimum corresponding to lattice constant of 9.881 @xmath48 .",
    "considering the experimental value of the lattice constant is 9.892 @xmath48 , this gives a deviation of about 0.1 @xmath49 , which is within the limit of lsda overbinding .",
    "the value of the bulk modulus , obtained by fitting the total energy vs volume curve with murnagahan equation of state @xcite is 230.6 gpa , which is of the same order as the experimentally measured value of @xmath3200 gpa in tl@xmath50cd@xmath51mn@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite .",
    "b@xmath39 is + 4.84 , much higher than that in cd doped tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 but within the expected limit .",
    "applying an on - site coulomb interaction of u=2 ev and j=0.7 ev on the mn site leads to a slightly better agreement with the experimental values .",
    "the lattice parameter changes to 9.888 @xmath48 , b@xmath27 and b@xmath39 remain unaltered . in view of the slightly improved results of lsda+u",
    ", we have used the b@xmath52 and b@xmath39 as estimated by lsda+u calculations to compute the pressure as given by eq.(5 ) .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table vi gives the magnetic exchange interaction strengths for all the three cases and their corresponding t@xmath4 s and density of states at e@xmath53 , d(e@xmath53 ) . for comparison , we also quote the numbers corresponding to pure tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 taken from ref@xcite .",
    "pristine tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 has a very strong nn fm interaction , a weak 2nn fm interaction and a little stronger 3nn afm interaction . with the introduction of doping ,",
    "all the interactions became fm and their strengths also increase .",
    "on further increase of doping , the 2nd and 3nn fm interactions become stronger with a small decrease in the nn fm interaction .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the results for x=0.25 doping with two nn mn atoms substituted , does not change significantly compared to the result when the two mn ions substituted were 3nns , proving that choice of disordered configuration does not alter the general trend .",
    "computation of t@xmath2 , using the values of j@xmath54 , j@xmath0 and j@xmath25 , listed in table i , show rapid increase in t@xmath2 on the initial doping which then attains a kind of saturation on further doping , considering upto moderate level of doping .",
    "this trend is in good agreement with experimental findings , but the quantitative values differ .",
    "this happens primarily because of the clustering effect not included in our calculation . to quote alonso",
    "al._@xcite , _",
    "`` for low doping levels , we can not disregard some type of magnetic clustering with almost pure tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 ( t@xmath2 = 135k ) and sb rich regions''_. such effects are bound to reduce the global t@xmath2 measured experimentally .",
    "also lattice relaxation effect could be important .",
    "although experimentally measured crystal structure data shows the same space group symmetry as that of the undoped one with little variation in the internal _ u _ parameter , the substitution of mn ion by a larger cation will probably change the structure locally .",
    "therefore structural relaxations of the doped compounds , which is beyond the scope of our present computational capacity , are needed to resolve the issue completely .",
    "zero of the energy is set at the fermi level of the undoped tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 compound .",
    "the upper ( lower ) panel corresponds to the majority ( minority ) spin .",
    "the negative of density of states has been plotted in the lower panel for clarity .",
    "inset shows the density of states in minority spin channel at the same doping levels for the energy region close to fermi level .",
    "the dashed lines in the inset correspond to the respective fermi levels.,width=321 ]    one needs to examine the electronic structure upon doping to understand the microscopic origin of the striking effect described above . in fig .",
    "[ dos_dope ] we show the density of states corresponding to sb - doped tl@xmath7mn@xmath7o@xmath8 for doping level of x=0.125 and 0.25 . to appreciate the changes in the electronic structure upon doping",
    ", we also show the density of states for pure tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 . comparing the various density of states ,",
    "we observe slight shrinking of the overall band - width due to the small expansion of the lattice .",
    "the t@xmath55-e@xmath56 splitting at the mn site decreases due to expansion of the mn - o bondlength .",
    "smearing of the dos , compared to pure case is also observed due to the effect of disordering .",
    "the sb ions in the 5 + state have completely filled 4d shell which are essentially core - like while 5s and 5p states remain more or less empty with no contribution to the states close to e@xmath53 .",
    "the most important effect is that of electron doping .",
    "replacement of mn@xmath43 by sb@xmath57 introduces additional electrons in the system which have no other option but to populate the highly dispersive tl - o-mn - t@xmath55 hybrid state in the minority spin channel . because of the highly dispersive nature of this band , the density of state in the minority spin channel close to e@xmath41 rises fast after the tail part which then attains a kind of small plateau before attaining highly peaked values corresponding to weakly dispersive mn t@xmath55 dominated states between 1 - 2 ev .",
    "this is shown in the inset of fig.[dos_dope ] .",
    "with introduction of first sb atom , the doped extra electrons while populating the dispersive minority spin band increases d(e@xmath41 ) substantially . upon increasing the number of sb atoms from one to two , the fermi level shifts towards right to accommodate more electrons , but since it has almost crossed the highly dispersive region and falls within the plateau - like structure , d(e@xmath41 ) does not change significantly .",
    "this is evident by quantitative estimates of d(e@xmath41 ) shown in table i. in fig.[dos_dope ] , we have shown only the case of x=0.25 ( nn ) , but the dos corresponding to x=0.25 ( 3nn ) is not very different and d(e@xmath41 ) changes only marginally . following the perturbative treatment in terms of the transfer integral @xcite , @xmath58 , between the magnetic and nonmagnetic site , the exchange coupling , j , within the proposed kinetic energy driven scheme is given by , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the average energy separation between the magnetic and nonmagnetic level and d(e@xmath41 ) is the density of states at fermi level introduced in the above . the real space representation of nmto - downfolded hamiltonian keeping tl-6s , mn -3d and o-2p states active and downfolding the rest shows that the tl - mn hopping integral , t s and their energy level separation changes only slightly for 0.3 @xmath49 and 0.9@xmath49 expansion of the lattice upon x=0.125 and 0.25 doping .",
    "the major changes come from the sharp increase in d(e@xmath41 ) which explains the enhancement of j s and t@xmath2 s in turn .    1.0 cm",
    "1.0 cm we presented a detailed study of tl@xmath7mn@xmath7o@xmath8 under pressure and sb - doped tl@xmath7mn@xmath7o@xmath8 using first - principles electronic structure calculations .",
    "the analysis of the computed electronic structure shows that the counter - intuitive experimental observation of suppression of ferromagnetic t@xmath2 upon application of pressure and its enhancement upon moderate amount of doping by sb in mn sublattice is naturally explained in terms of the hybridization induced mechanism proposed earlier@xcite .",
    "application of pressure reduces the hybridization between localized mn t@xmath55 level and the delocalized tl - o@xmath61 effective state due to the shifting of the position of the tl - o@xmath61 effective level , which weakens the driving mechanism of ferromagnetism and thereby reduces the strength of exchange coupling and the t@xmath2 .    in case of doping , on the other hand , the enhancement of t@xmath2 is induced by the charge - carrier doping of the system by sb .",
    "this enhances the value of density of states at the fermi energy significantly , thereby enhancing the exchange coupling and the t@xmath2 .",
    "our conclusions were substantiated by the explicit calculation of the j s and the t@xmath2 s .    in case of tl@xmath7mn@xmath7o@xmath8 under pressure",
    ", we resolved the issue related to the change in mn - o - mn angle .",
    "we carried out structural relaxation by means of accurate pseudopotential based total energy calculations .",

    "@xcite , the mn - o - mn angle decreases in agreement with the original suggestion by sushko _ et .",
    "however the decrease is only marginal and for all practical purposes , it may be assumed to remain same as that of tl@xmath7mn@xmath7o@xmath8 in ambient condition .",
