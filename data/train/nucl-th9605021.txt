    "a principal object of the investigation of heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies is to determine the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) , i.e. the properties of nuclear matter in equilibrium away from saturation and at non - zero temperatures .",
    "however , the phase space distribution in a heavy ion collision is out of global and even local equilibrium through most of the collision time .",
    "thus transport models have been developed to describe the evolution of the phase space @xcite .",
    "although these models are quite successful to reproduce data the attempts to determine the eos , e.g. , from the transverse flow in heavy ion collisions have not led to generally accepted results .",
    "recently also experimental collaborations , like fopi or eos , again focused on this problem @xcite .",
    "the difficulty is in part due to the non - equilibrium effects mentioned above .",
    "the common practice of theoretical calculations is to apply phenomenological mean fields like skyrme forces @xcite in a non - relativistic or the walecka model @xcite and its non - linear extensions in a relativistic approach @xcite .",
    "these forces contain parameters which allow to vary the characteristics of the corresponding eos . in some cases",
    "a phenomenological momentum dependence taken from the empirical nucleon - nucleus optical potential has been added @xcite .",
    "however , non - equilibrium features of the phase space are not contained in these forces , a fact which certainly will lead to uncertainties when conclusions on the ground state eos are drawn .",
    "a derivation of a kinetic equation from a microscopic non - equilibrium many - body theory shows that a consistent treatment requires to determine the effective interaction in the nuclear medium for the non - equilibrium phase space configurations of heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "generally , the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) theory provides a very successful approach to the many - body problem in nuclear matter @xcite and in finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "however , a solution of the bethe - salpeter equation for arbitrary anisotropic momentum configurations is extremely difficult .",
    "approximate treatments should retain the most important features of such configurations . to improve on the local density approximation ( lda )",
    "the phase space has been represented locally by two fermi ellipsoids separated by a relative momentum .",
    "we have called this the _ local configuration approximation _ ( lca ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the lda which refers to ground state nuclear matter the lca describes colliding nuclear matter ( cnm ) and should be able to reproduce the main features of the anisotropic momentum space in a heavy ion collision over the entire reaction time .",
    "however , even for the idealized momentum configuration of two fermi ellipsoids the bethe - salpeter equation has not yet been solved . only in a non - relativistic framework",
    "this problem has been treated before @xcite .",
    "therefore as a first step sehn et al .",
    "@xcite developed a procedure to construct self - energies for colliding nuclear matter from an appropriate parametrization of dbhf ground state results .",
    "these self - energies take into account specific non - equilibrium features of the momentum space and approximately include the correlations of the @xmath1-matrix . rather than introducing model parameters as , e.g. in the skyrme or the walecka model ,",
    "the dbhf mean fields are connected in a parameterfree way to the free nn - interaction . in this sense",
    "we call these fields `` realistic '' .",
    "we compare the present approach to experiment , i.e. to fopi flow data of the system @xmath0 on @xmath0 at 400 a.mev @xcite .",
    "in addition we compare to the lda and to a standard force used in relativistic heavy ion calculations , the non - linear walecka model ( nl2 ) .",

    "the system is treated as one fermi sphere in the lda .    to give an impression of the configuration effects we show in fig .",

    "nucleus collision in the cnm approximation @xcite is compared to the corresponding nucleon ",
    "nucleus optical potential @xcite at the same density . in cnm",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath32 originates from the dependence of the mean field on @xmath33 whereas in the lda , also shown in fig .",
    "[ opt_graph ] , the self - energy is taken at the corresponding density and kept constant .",
    "in the latter case @xmath34 scales linearly with energy as is the case , e.g. , also in the walecka model @xcite .",
    "the configuration dependence ( lca ) significantly softens the optical potential leading to a similar behavior as in nuclear matter when the full momentum dependence of the self - energy is included @xcite . at two times saturation density",
    "the nucleus ",
    "nucleus optical potential is even softer .",
    "= 10 cm    more exactly speaking we use `` cold '' cnm configurations to parametrize the phase space distribution , i.e. two sharp fermi spheres .",
    "more consistently one could use two fermi spheres of finite temperature . in a forthcoming work we analysed the phase space distribution in such a way",
    "and we find temperatures of less than about 30 mev . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is found that @xmath34 is only weakly changed at these temperatures and thus the assumption of zero temperature fields appears justified .    for the solution of the relativistic buu equation we use the relativistic landau - vlasov method @xcite which represents the phase space distribution by covariant gaussian testparticles in coordinate and momentum space .",
    "a fully consistent treatment of the kinetic equation in principle requires to treat the in - medium cross section on the same footing as the mean field @xcite .",
    "hence in ref .",
    "@xcite an in - medium cross section has been derived for cnm from the imaginary part of the dbhf self - energies . however , in this work we focus on the mean field and apply the standard cugnon parametrization @xcite for the cross section .",
    "as shown , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite the transverse flow does not react very sensitively to the cross section and we do not expect the present results to be significantly altered by the use of a consitently determined in - medium cross section .",
    "the present system is particularly well adapted to study non - equilibrium effects .",
    "the bombarding energy is high enough to result in distinct two - fermi - ellipsoid momentum configurations in the initial phase of the reaction and the densities reached in the compression phase are sufficiently high to test the density dependence of the eos .",
    "impact parameter selected high quality data of nuclear flow are provided by the fopi collaboration @xcite .",
    "= 12 cm    fig .",
    "2 shows the in - plane transverse flow per particle @xmath35 in units of the nucleon mass for four different @xmath36 bins . @xmath36",
    "is defined as the ratio of transversal to longitudinal kinetic energy deposited in the forward center - of - mass hemisphere @xcite and provides a measure for the impact parameter bins which run from semi - peripheral ( @xmath37 fm , @xmath38 ) to central ( @xmath39 ) collisions . for the analysis of the reaction we use the geometrical part of the fopi filter @xcite which takes into account acceptance cuts for different mass fragments .",
    "we therefore generated fragments after the collision ( 60 fm / c ) by a phase space coalescence model .",
    "the influence of the filter on the observables is similar as in ref .",
    "for the original experimental data the crossover of the flow from negative to positive values is slightly shifted to positive center - of - mass rapidity values .",
    "this behavior is quantitatively not well understood but is supposed to be due to recoil effects or double hits @xcite . after applying the filter analysis the crossover of the theoretical curves",
    "is slightly shifted to negative rapidities . for a better comparison of the flow , i.e. the slope of @xmath35 , in fig .",
    "2 we readjusted the crossovers to @xmath40 for theory and experiment .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "2 that the non - equilibrium dbhf mean fields ( lca ) are able to reasonably reproduce the data .",
    "the configuration dependence of the fields weakens their repulsion , as seen in fig.1 , resulting in less flow compared to a pure lda treatment . this configuration effect on",
    "the flow is strongly increasing with centrality and reaches a magnitude comparable to different equations of state , i.e. about 30% of the total amount of flow .",
    "this can be understood by the increasing overlap of the nuclei since only the participant matter feels configuration effects . for the spectator matter our description always results in a lda treatment .",
    "we also find that over the entire impact parameter range nl2 yields a too small transverse flow compared to the experiment .",
    "= 10 cm    in fig.3 we show the total amount of flow @xmath41 integrated over the forward center - of - mass hemisphere .",
    "again , the lca calculations are close to the data and also reproduce best the shape over the entire @xmath36 range .",
    "the larger deviation in the more peripheral collisions is probably due to the fact that the cnm mean fields are always determined for symmetric configurations ( @xmath30 ) . for the very central collisions ( high @xmath36 values ) the lda completely fails and overestimates the data by about a factor of 2 but becomes more reliable with increasing impact parameter .",
    "the nl2 model again strongly underestimates the flow .",
    "the above results are summarized in table 1 . there",
    "the mean in - plane directed transverse flow normalized to the center - of - mass projectile momentum per nucleon is given .",
    "the experimental value @xcite has been obtained for the pm4 event class corresponding to semi - central ( @xmath42 ) collisions .",
    "this quantity provides a good measure of the global repulsion of the model .",
    "the dbhf result is close to the experimental value when treated in the local configuration approximation ( lca ) .",
    "the local density approximation ( lda ) overestimates the experiment by about 30% and the nl2 parameter set of the non - linear walecka model underestimates the data by about 40% .",
    "ccccc + & & nl2 & exp + & lca & lda & & + @xmath43 & 0.187 & 0.232 & 0.103 & 0.173 + [ 0.2ex ]    to understand the influence of the mean field on the reaction dynamics we emphasize that in a relativistic approach the major part of the repulsion is due to lorentz forces generated by the vector field ( see fig .",
    "the repulsion and , correspondingly , the stiffness of the eos in first order is given by the effective mass ; the smaller the effective mass the more repulsive is the model @xcite .",
    "thus nl2 with a large effective mass ( @xmath44=0.83 ) is relatively soft whereas the dbhf eos ( @xmath44=0.586 ) is rather stiff .",
    "the momentum dependence of the mean field which is taken into account in the lca in an averaged form actually weakens this repulsion as also found in ref .",
    "the small vector fields of nl2 lead to an underestimation of the flow .",
    "furthermore , the density dependence of nl2 is too small to produce a sufficient amount of flow just by compression .",
    "thus the use of parametrizations with a stiffer eos but with the same @xmath45 will not significantly improve on this @xcite .",
    "the same reaction as above has been analyzed in the qmd approach in ref .",
    "@xcite using forces based on the non - relativistic ground state bhf @xmath46-matrix @xcite .",
    "there it was found that the strong and repulsive momentum dependence of the @xmath46-matrix is necessary to reproduce the data of the more peripheral collisions .",
    "however , in the more central collisions the non - relativistic @xmath46-matrix lacks a sufficient density dependence and results in a too small flow @xcite .",
    "this drawback is resolved in a relativistic approach where the @xmath1-matrix provides the appropriate balance between density and momentum dependence .",
    "realistic dbhf mean fields have been used in a detailed flow analysis of heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies .",
    "we have taken into account non - equilibrium features of the phase space in a local configuration approximation using mean fields determined for a colliding nuclear matter scenario .",
    "the ground state dbhf self - energies are rather repulsive relative to , e.g. , standard parametrizations of the non - linear walecka model . however ,",
    "if the configuration effects are taken into account properly the dbhf mean fields are able to reproduce the overall behavior of the experimental flow data .",
    "thus , the configuration effects turned out to be of major importance , especially if more central collisions are considered . a simple lda treatment results in too repulsive mean fields .",
    "the intrinsic momentum dependence of the local configuration approximation weakens this repulsion considerably .",
    "an extension of the colliding nuclear matter approximation to anisotropic configurations and the inclusion of finite temperature effects and of an in - medium cross section may still improve the present results .",
    "a more detailed comparison to data including also longitudinal flow variables will be forthcoming .    to summarize",
    "we conclude that dbhf mean fields based on realistic nn interactions are able to reproduce intermediate energy flow data , thus testing the dbhf approach also at high densities .",
    "it is found that the inclusion of non - equilibrium effects is important in order to learn something about the equation of state of ground state nuclear matter .",
    "+    the authors would like to thank l. sehn for valuable discussions .",
    "in particular , we thank w. reisdorf and p. dupieux for helpful discussions with respect to the comparison to the data and for providing us with the fopi filter simulation code ."
