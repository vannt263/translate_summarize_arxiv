    "the relationship between superconductivity and magnetism is a fundamental problem in the physics of strongly correlated electron systems . over the past two decades , unconventional superconductivity with symmetries other than @xmath9-wave symmetry has been found in several classes of materials , including heavy fermion ( hf ) , high-@xmath10 , ruthenate , and organic superconductors .",
    "unconventional superconductivity is characterized by anisotropic superconducting gap functions belonging to a nontrivial representation of the crystal symmetry group , which may have zeros ( nodes ) along certain directions in the brillouin zone @xcite . the nodal structure is closely related to the pairing interaction of the electrons and it is widely believed that the presence of nodes in almost all unconventional superconductors discovered up till now is a signature of a magnetically mediated interaction , instead of the conventional electron - phonon mediated interaction .",
    "hf compounds containing ce and u atoms are known to exhibit a rich variety of unconventional superconductivity associated with their peculiar magnetic properties @xcite . in these materials , as the temperature is lowered , @xmath11-electrons , which are well localized with well - defined magnetic moments at high temperatures , begin to become delocalized due to the hybridization of atomic and conduction electron wave functions .",
    "eventually , at very low temperatures , the @xmath11-electrons appear to become itinerant with heavy effective electron mass about one hundred times the free electron mass . in hf superconductors ,",
    "the strong coulomb repulsion within the atomic @xmath11-shells leads to a notable many - body effect and often gives rise to cooper pairing states with angular momentum greater than zero . therefore understanding the nodal structure of hf superconductors is important in understanding the physics of unconventional superconductivity in strongly correlated system .    among hf superconductors ,",
    "upd@xmath0al@xmath1 has aroused great interest because it displays quite unique properties . in upd@xmath0al@xmath1 , superconductivity with heavy mass ( sommerfelt specific coefficient @xmath12=140  mj / k@xmath13mol ) occurs at @xmath10=2.0  k after antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordering with atomic size local moments ( @xmath140.85@xmath15 ) occurs at @xmath16=14.3  k @xcite .",
    "below @xmath10 , superconductivity coexists with magnetic ordering .",
    "the ordered moments are coupled ferromagnetically and lie in the basal hexagonal @xmath3-plane along the @xmath17-axis .",
    "the ferromagnetic sheets are stacked antiferromagnetically along the @xmath6-axis with wave vector @xmath18=(0,0,@xmath19 ) , where @xmath6 is the @xmath6-axis lattice constant @xcite ( for the structure of the hexagonal basal plane , see the inset of fig .  1 ) .",
    "due to a pronounced magnetic anisotropy , the aligned spins tend to fluctuate in the basal plane .",
    "the presence of large local moments is in contrast to other hf superconductors , in which static magnetic moments are absent or very small if present @xcite . in upd@xmath0al@xmath1 , both the superconductivity and af ordering are associated with the 5@xmath11 electrons in the u atoms .",
    "the presence of the two subsystems , partly localized and partly itinerant , has been extensively studied in the context of the dual nature of strongly correlated electrons @xcite .    in the superconducting state of upd@xmath0al@xmath1 , two noticeable features have been reported .",
    "the first is the modulation of the tunneling conductivity above the superconducting gap at an energy of about 1.2  mev in cross - type tunnel junctions upd@xmath0al@xmath1-alo@xmath20-pb , on a upd@xmath0al@xmath1 thin film @xcite .",
    "furthermore , neutron inelastic scattering experiments have revealed a strongly damped af spin - wave excitation ( magnetic exciton ) with an excitation energy of about 1.5  mev at and in the vicinity of @xmath18 well below @xmath16 .",
    "such an anomaly in the tunneling spectrum is well known from ordinary strong coupling electron - phonon superconductors like pb . in analogy ,",
    "the  strong coupling anomalies `` observed in upd@xmath0al@xmath1 were attributed to the strong interaction between the hf quasiparticles and af spin - wave excitations .",
    "the second feature is the appearance of a  resonance peak '' in the neutron inelastic scattering in the vicinity of @xmath18 at about 0.3  mev well below @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this peak has been interpreted as the creation of quasielectron / quasihole pairs from superconducting condensed pairs by magnetic neutron scattering , which in turn appears to be closely related to the sign of the superconducting order parameter under the transition @xmath5@xmath21 @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that a resonance peak in the superconducting state has also been reported in @xmath7-wave high-@xmath23 cuprates @xcite and borocarbide superconductors @xcite but its origin is controversial .",
    "a major outstanding question about upd@xmath24al@xmath25 is the nature of the microscopic pairing interaction responsible for the superconductivity . to elucidate the pairing mechanism , identification of the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter",
    "is of primary importance .",
    "in particular , the gap structure of upd@xmath0al@xmath1 is expected to provide most valuable information on the relationship between the superconductivity and magnetism .",
    "the gap function of upd@xmath0al@xmath1 has been the subject of extensive studies .",
    "thermodynamic and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements have revealed that the gap function is anisotropic @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the nmr relaxation rate @xmath26 , which exhibits a @xmath27 behavior in the superconducting state over four orders of magnitude down to 0.1@xmath10 , along with the absence of the hebel - slichter coherence peak , indicate the existence of line nodes in the gap function @xcite .",
    "pauli limiting @xmath28 @xcite , nmr knight shift reduction @xcite , and @xmath29sr reduction in spin susceptibility @xcite below @xmath10 favors a spin singlet state .",
    "thus spin - singlet superconducting symmetry with line nodes in upd@xmath0al@xmath1 seems to be confirmed .",
    "it has been pointed out that the resonance peak around @xmath18 in the neutron inelastic scattering spectrum implies an order parameter displaying sign inversion on translation by @xmath18 on the fermi surface , due to the coherence factor in the dynamical susceptibility of the conduction electrons . in the simplest scenario , @xmath4(@xmath5 )",
    "@xmath30(@xmath22 ) is inferred , which suggests the existence of nodes orthogonal to the @xmath6-axis ( horizontal node ) , @xcite . here",
    "@xmath4(@xmath5 ) is the superconducting order parameter .",
    "although the coherence factor argument may place a constraint on the sign of the order parameter , the neutron scattering intensity mainly arises from a small minor band , which seems to be irrelevant in the occurrence of superconductivity , as suggested in ref .",
    "moreover , the neutron scattering results do not provide information on the position and number of the horizontal nodes and of the gap structure within the basal plane ( vertical node ) .",
    "the existence of horizontal nodes was also suggested by the tunneling conductance along the @xmath6-axis @xcite .",
    "however the tunnelling conductance in anisotropic superconductors strongly depends on the tunneling process of the junction , whether the process is coherent or incoherent , and on the transfer matrix originating from the atomic orbital at the surface , as extensively studied in high-@xmath10 cuprates @xcite .",
    "in fact , the typical @xmath7-wave gap structure has never been observed in @xmath6-axis tunneling experiments of high-@xmath10 cuprates .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of line nodes perpendicular to the basal plane is suggested by the anisotropy of the thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "thus , despite great experimental effort , the detailed structure of the superconducting order parameter is still an unresolved issue .",
    "therefore , there is a need for a probe of the quasiparticle excitation with spatial resolution in @xmath5-space .",
    "the purpose of this work is to determine the superconducting order parameter @xmath31@xmath5 ) of upd@xmath0al@xmath1 by measuring the angle resolved magneto - thermal transport , which has proven to be a powerful probe for determining low energy quasiparticle excitations , including direction @xcite .",
    "the thermal conductivity is a unique transport quantity that does not vanish in the superconducting state , responding to unpaired quasiparticles that carry the heat .",
    "we provide direct evidence that the gap function has a horizontal node located at the af zone boundary @xmath32 , and is isotropic within the basal plane .",
    "these results place strong constraints on models that attempt to explain the mechanism of the unconventional superconductivity of upd@xmath0al@xmath1 .",
    "we discuss the pairing mechanism infered by the gap structure .",
    "high quality single crystals of upd@xmath0al@xmath1 with @xmath33  k were grown by the czochralski pulling method in a tetra - arc furnace . the residual resistivity ratio was 55 along the @xmath34-axis and 40 along the @xmath6-axis , indicating the crystals were of the highest crystal quality currently achievable .",
    "the upper critical fields in @xmath2 parallel to the @xmath17- , @xmath35 , and @xmath6-axes at 0.4  k , determined by the resistive transitions , were @xmath36=3.2  t , @xmath37=3.1  t , and @xmath38=3.8  t , respectively .",
    "we measured thermal conductivity along the @xmath6-axis of the hexagonal crystal structure , @xmath39 ( heat current @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath6 ) and along the @xmath34-axis @xmath42 ( _ * q * _ @xmath41",
    "@xmath34 ) by the steady - state method .",
    "the sample dimensions for the @xmath39 and @xmath42 measurements were 0.32@xmath430.34@xmath432.50 mm@xmath44 and 0.22@xmath430.50@xmath431.80 mm@xmath44 , respectively . to apply @xmath2 with high accuracy relative to the crystal axes , we used a system with two superconducting magnets generating magnetic fields in two mutually orthogonal directions and a @xmath44he cryostat set on a mechanical rotating stage at the top of a dewar . by computer - controlling the two superconducting magnets and rotating stage",
    ", we were able to rotate @xmath2 with a misalignment of less than 0.5@xmath45 from each axis , which we confirmed by the simultaneous measurements of the resistivity .    in the present experiments , @xmath42 and @xmath39",
    "were measured keeping @xmath2 always perpendicular to @xmath40 , i.e. the heat current perpendicular to the vortices dominates .",
    "this configuration ( @xmath2@xmath46@xmath40 ) is important because when the angle between @xmath40 and @xmath2 is changed by rotating @xmath2 , an additional angular variation of the thermal conductivity appears as a function of the angle between @xmath2 and @xmath40 due to the difference in the effective density of states ( dos ) for quasiparticles traveling parallel to the vortices and for those moving in the perpendicular direction . in the field",
    "rotation experiments , the thermal conductivity was measured after field cooling above @xmath23 . consecutive measurements with an inverted direction produced little hysteresis in the angular dependence of the thermal conductivity , which indicates that field trapping related to vortex pinning was negligible .",

    "figure 1 depicts the temperature dependence of @xmath42 and @xmath39 in zero field .",
    "the magnitude and @xmath49-dependence of @xmath42 and @xmath39 are similar to those reported in ref .",

    "there are three contributions that carry the heat ; electrons , phonons and spin - waves .",
    "the spin - wave contribution appears to be negligible below @xmath10 , because a spin - wave has a finite gap of @xmath50  mev at the zone center and can not contribute to the heat conduction at low temperatures .",
    "the wiedemann - franz ratio @xmath51 at @xmath10 is 0.95@xmath52 for @xmath39 and is 1.16@xmath53 for @xmath42 , where @xmath53 is the lorentz number and @xmath54 is the resistivity .",
    "these results indicate that the electron contribution strongly dominates over the phonon contribution , at least below @xmath10 .",
    "unfortunately the present temperature range ( the lowest temperature was 0.28  k ) is not low enough to determine the detailed @xmath49-dependence and residual values of @xmath42 and @xmath39 , which would provide important information about the gap structure .",

    "@xmath42 is normalized by the normal state value just above the upper critical field @xmath57 . ]",
    "the @xmath2-dependence of the thermal conductivity in the superconducting state is markedly different from that observed in ordinary @xmath9-wave superconductors , in which the thermal conductivity shows an exponential behavior with much slower growth with @xmath2 at @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the heat transport for superconductors with nodes has progressed considerably during past few years @xcite .",
    "in contrast to classical superconductors , the heat transport in nodal superconductors is dominated by contributions from delocalized quasiparticle states rather than bound states associated with vortex cores .",
    "the most remarkable effect on the thermal transport is the doppler shift of the energy of quasiparticles with momentum @xmath59 in the circulating supercurrent flow @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) @xcite .",
    "this effect ( volovik effect ) becomes important at positions where the local energy gap becomes smaller than the doppler shift term ( @xmath62 ) , which can be realized in the case of superconductors with nodes . in the presence of line nodes where the density of states ( dos ) of electrons @xmath63 has a linear energy dependence ( @xmath64 ) , @xmath65 increases in proportion to @xmath66 . at high temperatures and low fields , where the condition @xmath67 is satisfied",
    ", the thermally excited quasiparticles dominate over the doppler shifted quasiparticles .",
    "it has been shown that in this regime , while the doppler shift enhances the dos , it also leads to a suppression of both the impurity scattering time and andreev scattering time off the vortices @xcite .",
    "this suppression can exceed the parallel rise in @xmath63 at high temperatures and low fields , which results in nonmonotonic field dependence of the thermal conductivity .",
    "as seen in other superconductors with nodes , the initial decrease of the thermal conductivity disappears at low temperatures .",
    "the steep increase of @xmath42 near @xmath28 , which is also observed in pure nb , upt@xmath1 , and sr@xmath0ruo@xmath68 , may be due to the enhancement of the quasiparticle mean free path caused by tunneling between vortex cores , which is possible near @xmath28 .",
    "thus the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath42 in upd@xmath0al@xmath1 , initial decrease at low field at high temperatures and linear behavior @xmath56 at low temperatures , are in agreement with the existence of line nodes in @xmath69 .",
    "we note that quite similar @xmath2-dependence has been reported in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath68 with an anisotropic gap function @xcite .     within the basal plane .",

    "the dos shows a maximum ( minimum ) when @xmath2 is applied in the anitinodal ( nodal ) direction . ]",
    "we here briefly discuss the band structure of upd@xmath0al@xmath1 . according to band calculations and de haas - van alphen measurements in the af phase",
    ", the fermi surface has four principle sheets of predominantly 5@xmath11-electron character , which are labeled `` cigar '' , `` eggs'',``cylinder '' , and `` party hat '' @xcite .",
    "the largest fermi sheet with large electron mass and the strongest 5f - admixture is the `` cylinder '' , which has the shape of a corrugated cylinder with hexagonal in - plane anisotropy .",
    "therefore it is natural to consider that the thermal conductivity is mainly determined by this fermi sheet . in what follows ,",
    "we assume that the cylindrical fermi sheet with heavy mass is responsible for the superconductivity , neglecting all other sheets .",
    "rotating in the @xmath72-plane for various gap functions .",
    "two - fold oscillation with the same sign are expected for type - i , -ii , and -iii . on the other hand , for type - iv , an oscillation with a double minimum",
    "is expected . ]",
    "having established the predominant contribution of the delocalized quasiparticles in the thermal transport , the next issue is the nodal structure of upd@xmath0al@xmath1 .",
    "an important advantage of measuring the thermal conductivity is that it is a directional probe of the nodal structure .",
    "recently measurement of the thermal conductivity or heat capacity with @xmath2 applied various directions relative to the crystal axes has been established as a powerful method to determine the superconducting gap structures in @xmath5-space . at the heart of this method is the volovik effect discussed previously .",
    "since quasiparticles contribute to the dos when the doppler - shifted energy exceeds the local energy gap ( @xmath73 ) , an immediate conclusion is that the dos depends sensitively on the angle between @xmath2 and the direction of the nodes .",
    "the periodicity , phase , and shape of typical oscillations in the angular variation of the thermal conductivity give direct information of the gap structure , including the type of nodes ( point or line ) and their direction .",
    "therefore , possible allowed gap functions can be much more restricted in @xmath5-space .",
    "it should be noted that this method does not rely on any specific mechanism of the superconductivity .",
    "we first discuss the case when @xmath2 is rotated within the basal @xmath3-plane . here , for simplicity , we assume @xmath70 symmetry with four line nodes located perpendicular to the basal plane , and assume a circular cross section of the fermi sheet , neglecting the hexagonal in - plane anisotropy , as illustrated in figs .  3 ( a ) and ( b ) . here",
    "@xmath71=(@xmath2,@xmath17 ) is the azimuthal angle measured from the @xmath17-axis .",
    "one expects a significant anisotropy between the field induced dos for @xmath2 parallel to the nodal directions and @xmath2 parallel to the anti - nodal direction .",
    "the doppler effect should also lead to angular dependence of the dos for @xmath2 rotated within the basal plane .",
    "a minimum in the dos occurs when @xmath2 is along the nodal directions . since",
    ", in that case , at two of the four nodes , the circulating currents are in the plane orthogonal to the momentum vector at the nodes , the doppler shift vanishes ; only two nodes contribute to the dos , as illustrated in fig .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath2 is directed along the antinodal directions , the doppler shift is non - zero at some points in space for each node and all four nodes contribute to the dos . as a result , the dos oscillates with four - fold symmetry , as shown in fig .",
    "the amplitude of the dos oscillation @xmath74 appears to be model dependent , but all calculations predict an amplitude ranging from 3% to 10% at zero temperature .",
    "in fact , a clear four - fold modulation of the thermal conductivity , which reflects the angular position of the nodes , has been observed in the high-@xmath10 cuprate yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath75 @xcite , heavy fermion cecoin@xmath76 @xcite , and organic @xmath77-(bedt - ttf)@xmath0cu(ncs)@xmath0 @xcite with @xmath7-wave symmetries and in borocarbide yni@xmath24b@xmath24c with @xmath78-wave symmety @xcite , while such an oscillation is absent in the fully gapped y(ni@xmath79pt@xmath80)@xmath24b@xmath24c with @xmath9-wave symmetry @xcite , demonstrating that thermal conductivity can be a relevant probe of the superconducting gap structure . in general , @xmath39 oscillates with @xmath81-fold symmetry corresponding to the number of vertical nodes @xmath81 .",
    "we next discuss the situation when @xmath2 is rotated within the @xmath72-plane perpendicular to the basal @xmath3-plane .",

    "the expected angular variations corresponding to these gap functions are shown schematically in fig .",
    "here @xmath86 is the polar angle between @xmath2 and the @xmath6-axis .",
    "the angular variation of the doppler shifted dos is a function of the relative angle between @xmath2 and @xmath59 .",
    "therefore the twofold oscillations with the same phase are expected for type - i , -ii , and -iii gap functions , in which the horizontal nodes are located at the position where @xmath59@xmath87-plane ; one can not distinguish these three gap functions when the fermi surface has an open orbit along the @xmath6-axis . for type - iv ,",
    "one expects an oscillation with a double maximum structure as a function of @xmath86 .",
    "we note that the angular variation is dominated by the doppler shifted dos at low fields . on the other hand , at high fields near @xmath28 , there are additional contributions which also cause the oscillation of the dos , i.e. the anisotropy of the fermi velocity and @xmath28 @xcite .",

    "the first is superconductivity mediated by the exchange of af spin - wave excitation ( magnetic excitons ) ; the coupling between localized- and itinerant - subsystem is essential for the occurrence of superconductivity @xcite . the second is a mechanism based on the af spin fluctuation arising from the strong electron - electron correlation in the itinerant subsystem , ignoring the localized subsystem @xcite .",
    "this model predicts vertical nodes , which is inconsistent with the present results .",
    "the existence of horizontal nodes strongly supports the interpretation inferred from the resonance peak observed at the af bragg point in the neutron inelastic scattering experiments .",
    "the horizontal node located at the af zone center indicates that pair partners can not reside in the same basal plane .",
    "the interlayer pairing appears to indicate that strong dispersion of the magnetic excitation along @xmath110 causes the pairing , as suggested in the magnetic exciton mediated superconductivity model @xcite .",
    "this dispersion is connected with the fluctuation of the out - of - plane component of the ordered moments , because the in - plane moments are saturated at @xmath111 and should not have large fluctuations .",
    "the isotropic gap function in the basal plane implies that the pairing interaction in the neighboring planes strongly dominates over the interaction in the same plane .",
    "this is incompatible with the theory in which only the electron correlation in the basal plane is responsible for the superconductivity .",
    "although the pairing interaction inferred from the determined gap function should be further scrutinized , the recent results imply that the interlayer pairing interaction associated with the af interaction is most likely to be the origin of the unconventional superconductivity in upd@xmath0al@xmath1 .",
