    "sunspots have been studied scientifically since the invention of the telescope , and reliable daily sunspot number records are available from the early 1800s .",
    "the accepted quantity to characterise solar activity is the international sunspot number @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of individual sunspots , @xmath2 is the number of sunspot groups , and @xmath3 is a correction factor @xcite . the sunspot number changes in a secular or long - term fashion with the semi - regular 11-year sunspot cycle , driven by an internal magnetic dynamo which generates the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the secular change in sunspot number exhibits apparent randomness , as evidenced by the extensive literature describing the smoothed daily sunspot number ( typically a monthly average ) as a stochastic , or chaotic time series .",
    "in particular , the peak and timing of the different solar cycles shows considerable variation @xcite .",
    "sunspot numbers also vary on shorter time scales , in particular daily , as a result of the complicated local processes associated with sunspot formation , evolution , and decay .",
    "the short - timescale variation produces large excursions in sunspot number , up to 100 per day in extreme cases @xcite . the large day to day variations",
    "are caused by the rapid evolution of magnetic structures , and the sudden appearance / disappearance of large active regions .",
    "these rapid developments can have important consequences for the space weather experienced on earth @xcite .",
    "recently , it was demonstrated that the change @xmath4 in the daily sunspot number ( for days on which the number does change ) follows a laplace , or double exponential distribution @xcite . including the case of days with no changes , @xcite modelled the distribution @xmath5 of the change in sunspot number with the functional form @xmath6 where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are constants , and where @xmath9 is the indicator function defined by @xmath10 for @xmath11 true , and @xmath12 for @xmath11 false .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 determines the fraction of zero changes , and @xmath13 is the mean absolute change for days on which the number does change .",
    "normalisation of equation  ( [ eq : pop_law ] ) requires @xmath14 .",
    "figure  [ fig : f1 ] shows the observed distribution for the daily sunspot number using the ngdc data for 18502011 , and illustrates the exponential form identified by @xcite .",
    "the top panel is a histogram of daily changes @xmath4 .",
    "the bottom panel shows the cumulative number of changes greater than @xmath15 , for positive changes : @xmath16 and the cumulative number less than @xmath15 for negative changes : @xmath17 both panels use a logarithmic scaling on the vertical axis .",
    "the red dots in the panels show the data , and the blue curves show the model distribution defined by equation ( [ eq : pop_law ] ) , with parameters @xmath13 and @xmath8 estimated from the data using maximum likelihood @xcite .",
    "the adherence to the exponential form in figure [ fig : f1 ] is striking .",
    "there are a large number of days with no change in sunspot number , and @xcite refers to @xmath18 as a `` special state '' .",
    "the distribution is remarkably symmetric about @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite also investigated the solar cycle dependence of the observed distribution , and found that the exponential rule in absolute changes is most closely adhered to over whole cycles , with the greatest departure near minima of cycles .",
    "it is surprising that the laplace distribution in the change in daily sunspot number was not identified and discussed in the literature earlier .",
    "the behaviour was previously noted in smoothed data @xcite , and an approximate exponential dependence in the distribution of overall sunspot numbers , related to equation  ( [ eq : pop_law ] ) , was also commented on @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the adherence of the observed changes in daily sunspot number to the laplace distribution defined by equation ( [ eq : pop_law ] ) is much stricter than the approximate exponential distribution of overall sunspot number .",
    "the laplace distribution ( equation  ( [ eq : pop_law ] ) ) represents a newly identified phenomenological rule describing the way in which the daily sunspot number varies , which should have application for modelling and prediction .",
    "the origin of the distribution is not obvious .",
    "changes in sunspot number occur daily due to sunspot group formation , evolution and decay , the appearance / disappearance of spots and spot splitting ( referred to here as spot evolution ) , and also due to sunspot groups and individual spots rotating onto and off the visible disc .",
    "if the law is due to spot and group evolution , then the phenomenological rule must have a physical origin .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the laplace distribution of changes in sunspot number is caused by sunspots forming , evolving , and decaying , and is not a result of rotation on and off the disc .",
    "we then also present a simple monte carlo method , based on equation  ( [ eq : pop_law ] ) and some additional assumptions , for simulating sunspot numbers over solar cycles .",
    "to investigate the origin of the observed distribution in changes in sunspot number we use reports of sunspot groups on the sun , for 1981 - 2011 , compiled by us national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( usaf / noaa ) .",
    "the daily change in sunspot number @xmath19 can be decomposed into changes due to rotation of regions and spots onto and off the disc @xmath20 , and changes due to group and sunspot evolution @xmath21 : @xmath22 similarly the terms @xmath23 and @xmath24 on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : changeins ] ) can be decomposed in this way . to approximate the change due to rotation @xmath20",
    "we assume that active regions first appearing on the disc within @xmath25 of the eastern limb arrive due to rotation within a day , and regions last observed on the disc within @xmath26 of the western limb disappear due to rotation within a day .",
    "the factor of 14 days is the approximate time to rotate across the disc @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : f2 ] shows the result of the analysis of the data .",
    "the figure presents the cumulative distribution of the total change in sunspot number @xmath4 using the complete data set ( black ) , the change due to rotation of spots and groups onto and off the disc @xmath27 ( blue ) , and the changes due to the evolution of spots and groups @xmath28 ( red ) .",
    "the distributions of the total change @xmath4 and change due to evolution @xmath29 are very similar , and both clearly show the laplace distribution of equation  ( [ eq : pop_law ] ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath20 exhibits significant falls in number at @xmath30 , which may be attributed to entire sunspot groups rotating onto and off the disc ( groups are weighted with a factor of 10 in the definition of the international sunspot number  see equation ( [ eq : issn ] ) ) .",
    "an important feature of figure  [ fig : f2 ] is that the number of changes due to rotation onto and off the visible disc is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the number of changes due to evolution .",
    "there are too few changes associated with active regions rotating onto and off the visible disc for this to influence the overall distribution of changes in sunspot number .",
    "it is very unlikely that the observed double exponential distribution of changes , for days on which the sunspot number does change , is influenced by the small number of active regions which rotate onto or off the disc in a day .",
    "it is possible that the observed laplace distribution arises from an averaging of locally non - exponential distributions across the disk . to test this",
    "we also calculate the cumulative fraction of changes occurring in particular 26@xmath31 strips on the disc . in other words ,",
    "we identify the active regions in the strips on a given day , and calculate the sunspot number due to these regions only . on the next day",
    "we identify the regions in the strips , and again count the sunspot number due to these regions .",
    "the difference between these two counts is the change in sunspot number in a day occurring in the particular strips .",
    "this count includes both changes due to rotations into and out of the strips , and changes due to evolution in the strips .",
    "figure  [ fig : f2x ] shows the results .",
    "changes occurring in the region @xmath32 and @xmath33 are in blue , changes occurring in the region @xmath34 and @xmath35 are in black , changes occurring in the region @xmath36 and @xmath37 are in green , and changes occurring at the limbs ( _ i.e. _ @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) are in red .",
    "figure  [ fig : f2x ] shows that changes associated with regions in a restricted range of longitudes reproduce the observed laplace distribution .",
    "the exception is the distribution of changes at each limb , which shows large falls in probability due to changes in the number of groups in the strips , and a significantly smaller proportion of large changes in sunspot number .",
    "presumably these differences arise due to the difficulty of accurately observing sunspot regions at the limb , and in particular , resolving the number of individual spots in a group .",
    "this may explain why this particular distribution is dominated by changes in the number of groups .",
    "figure  [ fig : f2x ] shows that the observed laplace distribution in total changes does not arise from averaging over non - exponential local distributions in particular strips .",
    "the conclusion is that the laplace distribution form is representative of changes in daily sunspot number due to the local evolution of sunspot groups on the sun .",
    "it reflects the physical processes occurring .",
    "@xcite investigated the daily change in sunspot number @xmath4 using data over complete cycles , which involve days with a range of different initial values @xmath40 of the sunspot number at each change .",
    "the phenomenological rule represented by equation ( [ eq : pop_law ] ) was found to hold to a very good approximation for the range @xmath41 over the last 14 cycles , although departures from the rule for small changes in sunspot number were noted .",
    "this departure may be attributed to the discrete nature of sunspot number , which means that the minimum sunspot number larger than zero is @xmath42 ( where @xmath3 is typically less than unity ) .",
    "this causes a discrete jump in the tabulated daily values of the international sunspot number from zero to seven ( and implies that the average value of @xmath3 used by observers is @xmath43 ) .",
    "departures for large changes in sunspot number were also noted . this may be attributed to the finite size of the sunspot number over any cycle .",
    "large negative changes in sunspot number are unlikely because the sunspot number is unlikely to have a sufficiently large value at any given time over a cycle to allow that change .",
    "the distribution of a change @xmath4 on a given day is dependent on the value of sunspot number on that day .",
    "to model this we introduce transition probabilities @xmath44 for changes from an initial sunspot number @xmath40 to a final sunspot number @xmath45 on a day , given that the sunspot number is initially @xmath40 .",
    "the function on the right hand side is a conditional distribution , and in section [ subsection : transition ] we consider a suitable functional form for this distribution . in section [",
    "subsection : relationship ] we relate the chosen form of the conditional distribution @xmath46 and @xcite s exponential distribution @xmath5 of changes over complete cycles , and demonstrate how to estimate parameters from the data , for the proposed conditional distribution .      to gain insight into a suitable function form for the conditional distribution in equation ( [ eq : trans1 ] ) we re - examine the data .",
    "figure [ fig:2x ] is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) histogram @xmath47 of the number of days for which the sunspot number simultaneously has the value @xmath40 ( enumerated along the vertical axis ) , and increases by @xmath4 to the next day ( horizontal axis ) , for the ngdc data for 1815 - 2010 .",
    "the bins are chosen to be of size two in @xmath4 and @xmath40 , and the figure shows the normalised histogram @xmath48 so that the greyscale density along each row shows the relative probability of a given change @xmath15 , for the given initial sunspot number @xmath49 . a nonlinear scaling",
    "is applied to the greyscale density , to better show the bins with small numbers of days .",
    "figure [ fig:2x ] illustrates the influence of the lower boundary @xmath50 required by the non  negativity of sunspot number .",
    "the distribution is relatively symmetric about @xmath51 for any given initial sunspot number @xmath40 , except for an excess of days at the @xmath52 boundary ( which correspond to changes leading to a zero sunspot number ) , and an excess of days with no change ( _ i.e. _ @xmath51 ) .",
    "based on figure [ fig:2x ] , a suitable approximate model form for equation ( [ eq : trans1 ] ) is a simple exponential distribution symmetric about @xmath18 for each value of @xmath40 , with the same coefficient in the exponent for both negative and positive changes .",
    "the ( asymmetric ) non  negativity of sunspot number may be imposed by requiring that transitions producing a negative final sunspot number @xmath53 lead to zero sunspot number @xmath54 instead .",
    "this may be written as : @xmath55\\mathbb{i}(s'<s ) + d\\exp\\left[(s - s')/e\\right ] \\mathbb{i}(s'>s)\\nonumber \\\\ & & + g\\delta(s ' ) + h\\delta(s'-s),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are constants , and where the two terms involving delta functions describe the excess of days with changes leading to zero final sunspot number , and the excess of days on which the sunspot number does not change , respectively .",
    "the data show that for the observed changes in daily sunspot number for 18502011 the fraction of negative and positive jumps are approximately equal ( 42@xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively ) , so we assume the same symmetry holds for each value of @xmath40 in equation ( [ eq : pop_law_cond ] ) : @xmath60 normalising over all final sunspot numbers @xmath45 , _",
    "i.e. _ requiring @xmath61 leads to @xmath62 and @xmath63 the model conditional distribution ( equation ( [ eq : pop_law_cond ] ) ) then has two parameters , @xmath64 and @xmath57 .",

    "the parameter @xmath57 is the probability of no change in daily sunspot number .",
    "the overall distribution of changes @xmath5 may be calculated from the transitional distribution ( equation ( [ eq : pop_law_cond ] ) ) by integrating over all starting values @xmath40 , _",
    "i.e. _ calculating @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a constant imposing normalisation over changes in sunspot number : @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the probability of an initial sunspot number @xmath40 in the observations . a suitable choice to approximately describe the distribution of sunspot number @xmath69 over a complete solar cycle is an exponential @xcite , the adherence of the overall sunspot number to an exponential distribution is only very approximate ( by comparison with the observed distribution of changes in daily sunspot number , which follows the laplace distribution quite strictly ) .",
    "] @xmath70 where the mean value of daily sunspot number ( based on observations for 18502011 ) is @xmath71 . calculating the integral in equation ( [ eq : formula ] ) gives @xmath72 \\mathbb{i}(\\delta s < 0 ) + \\frac{1-h}{2e}{\\rm e}^{-\\delta s / e }   \\mathbb{i}(\\delta s > 0 ) \\nonumber \\\\   & + h \\delta ( \\delta s ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the normalisation by equation ( [ eq : deltanorm ] ) implies @xmath73 for the case of negative changes ( @xmath74 ) , equation ( [ eq : modelchanges ] ) contains a term @xmath75 which makes the distribution @xmath76 asymmetric about @xmath18 , and which is produced by changes leading to zero sunspot number .",
    "the characteristic size of this term is @xmath77 , suggesting that the asymmetry in the distribution in @xmath4 produced by the lower boundary @xmath50 is not a strong effect . in the absence of the extra term",
    "the normalisation constant is @xmath78 , and based on the data we find @xmath79 .",
    "neglecting the extra term and setting @xmath78 , the distribution of changes implied by the conditional distribution ( equation ( [ eq : pop_law_cond ] ) ) is @xmath80 which is the same functional form as equation ( [ eq : pop_law ] ) , the @xcite distribution of changes .",
    "the correspondence between the conditional distribution ( equation ( [ eq : pop_law_cond ] ) ) and the overall distribution of changes ( equation ( [ eq : approxmodelchanges ] ) ) allows the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath57 of the conditional distribution to be estimated from the daily changes @xmath4 over a cycle using maximum likelihood .",
    "specifically , the exponential coefficient @xmath13 ( see equation ( [ eq : pop_law_cond ] ) ) estimated for the overall distribution may be taken as the estimate for coefficient @xmath64 in the conditional distribution , and the fraction of days @xmath8 with no change in sunspot number ( see equation ( [ eq : pop_law_cond ] ) ) in the overall distribution may be taken as the estimate of the corresponding parameter @xmath57 in the conditional distribution .",
    "in this section we apply the conditional distribution ( equation ( [ eq : pop_law_cond ] ) ) in a monte carlo simulation of daily sunspot numbers @xmath81 , where @xmath82 refers to a day . the daily random variation in sunspot number",

    "this is achieved as follows . for a given initial sunspot number @xmath40 and the estimates of @xmath64 and @xmath57",
    "we generate a final sunspot number @xmath86 by generating an exponential random variable @xmath4 with parameter @xmath64 _ i.e. _ a random deviate @xmath4 distributed according to @xmath87 . a random variable @xmath88 which is uniformly distribution on @xmath89",

    "this model accounts for the stochastic variation in sunspot number according to the conditional distribution given by equation  ( [ eq : pop_law_cond ] ) , but it does not account for the secular or long time - scale variation of the sunspot number over a solar cycle ( the `` shape '' of the cycle ) .",
    "recently @xcite presented a method for modelling the solar cycle variation in a general fokker - planck description of stochastic variation in sunspot number , and the same procedure is applied here .",

    "<S> recently pop ( _ solar phys . _ * 276 * , 351 , 2012 ) identified a laplace ( or double exponential ) distribution in the number of days with a given absolute value in the change over a day , in sunspot number , for days on which the sunspot number does change . </S>",
    "<S> we show this phenomenological rule has a physical origin attributable to sunspot formation , evolution , and decay , rather than being due to the changes in sunspot number caused by groups rotating onto and off the visible disc . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate a simple method to simulate daily sunspot numbers over a solar cycle using the @xcite result , together with a model for the cycle variation in the mean sunspot number . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure is applied to three recent solar cycles . </S>",
    "<S> we check that the simulated sunspot numbers reproduce the observed distribution of daily changes over those cycles . </S>"
