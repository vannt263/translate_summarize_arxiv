    "the polar - cap pair - production model of pulsar emission has remained the chief theory of the region thought to give rise to the radiative emission for the past 30 years .",

    "these particles emit @xmath2-rays which pair - produce in the high background magnetic field .",
    "these pairs then short out the magnetic field @xcite , preventing further acceleration .",
    "the physics of this pair production process has been partially explored , with progress ranging from the initial generational models of @xcite , the pair formation front structure calculations of @xcite , the detailed monte carlo simulations of @xcite , and the more recent `` full - cascade '' generational model of @xcite .",
    "our paper describes an improved analytical and theoretical understanding of this pair - production mechanism , not only reproducing the final @xmath2-ray and pair spectra calculated by @xcite , but detailing the spatial extent of the pair - production process itself , giving a more thorough understanding of the process .",
    "these straightforward analytic approximations to the pair production process were the basis of the model of @xcite , henceforth called paper i. in this paper , we exhibit the full shower theory underlying those approximations and find a variety of formulae which represent the numerical solutions of the cascade equations , thus allowing users of the cascade physics to easily apply the results to other problems .",
    "we give a full description of the pair plasma emergent from pulsar polar caps .",
    "we reserve discussion of the emergent @xmath2-ray luminosities and spectra to a separate paper , as these are of direct observational relevance .",
    "the dominant opacity for pair production over pulsar polar caps is the @xmath2-@xmath3 process , wherein a high - energy photon interacts with the background magnetic field to form an electron - positron pair .",
    "the competing process of @xmath2-@xmath2 pair production , wherein a high - energy photon interacts with a background x - ray to form a pair , is only competitive if the background x - ray flux is equivalent to a black - body with temperature nearly @xmath4 k , well beyond the observed limits on stellar temperatures .",
    "according to @xcite , the opacity for @xmath2-@xmath3 pair - production is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the critical quantum magnetic field , @xmath7 gauss , @xmath8 is the fine structure constant , @xmath9 cm is the reduced compton wavelength , @xmath3 is the local magnetic field strength , @xmath10 is the pitch angle between the photon momentum and the local magnetic field , and @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the photon energy , in units of @xmath13 . for the remainder of this paper ,",

    "the full cross section must be used @xcite , and for magnetic fields equal to or higher than @xmath6 , higher - order corrections become important , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "most pulsars , however , pair produce into high landau levels for the most significant photons and have @xmath15 . as this work intends to describe the `` typical '' pulsar , we neglect these high - energy and high - field effects .      because the relativistic primary electron beam follows the magnetic field ,",
    "the primary photons are beamed close to parallel to the local field . if the beam electrons have a lorentz factor @xmath2 , the primary photons are beamed into a cone of opening angle @xmath16 .",
    "typical beam lorentz factors are of order @xmath17 or higher , giving an initial pitch angle small compared to the pitch angles required for pair - production . to a good approximation ,",

    "this is accurate to second order in @xmath10 .    for a dipole field ,",
    "the photon pitch angle depends on radius ( through second order in the colatitude , @xmath23 ) as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the radius of emission and @xmath26 is the current radius , both measured from the center of the dipole , and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the field line radius of the magnetic colatitude of the field line in question at the surface of the star and @xmath29 is a factor used to crudely take into account the possibility of non - dipolar components to the magnetic field at low altitude .",

    "if @xmath48 is large , most of the absorption takes place on the leading edge of the exponential .",
    "since the opacity is increasing exponentially in that regime , we can approximate the integral by expanding around the upper endpoint to find @xmath49 where @xmath50 and where @xmath51 has been defined to be @xmath52 for @xmath53 and 256/27 for @xmath54 .",

    "photons with energies well above @xmath123 pair - produce in a correspondingly shorter distance , so the photons near @xmath123 set the spatial expanse of the cascade .",

    "these approximations effectively collapse the entire synchrotron emission of a created pair into a pulse of photons at the peak energy of the synchrotron spectrum . by using the moments of the photon spectra",
    ", we can derive similar approximations , but with wider applicability .",
    "at each generation , the number of photons increases by a factor of @xmath150 , while the total energy in the photons decreases by a factor of @xmath151 , so the average energy of the @xmath164 generation is @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the average energy of the input spectrum .",

    "we can apply similar arguments to the _ spatial _ extent of the cascade . from equation ( [ eq : dr_a ] ) , the photons of generation @xmath157 , with mean energy @xmath174 , must propagate a distance @xmath175 before pair - producing . relating the multiplicity of generation @xmath157 , equation ( [ eq : multiplicity_j ] ) , to this propagation distance",
    "gives a power - law dependence between the multiplicity and the distance , @xmath176 where the power - law exponent , @xmath177 , is identical to that of the energy - multiplicity relation , equation ( [ eq : nu ] ) .",
    "since the ots method can not spatially resolve the pair cascade , we turn to a numerical calculation .",

    ", we simply evaluate the photon spectrum @xmath178 at logarithmically spaced points in @xmath12 .",
    "the relation between the synchrotron photons output and the absorbed spectrum at a given radius is then a simple matrix multiplication by @xmath179 . due to the variation of magnetic field with altitude ,",
    "this matrix will also depend on the altitude .",
    "we then discretize the radial steps on a variable scale , with either purely logarithmic steps , in cases where we are primarily concerned with the @xmath2-ray output and the location of the pff , or a combination of logarithmic steps , up to a polar - cap radius , and linear steps beyond , to calculate a smooth pair spectrum . since the final pair energies depend on the local magnetic field , the pair spectrum is more sensitive to the spatial variations in the field , requiring this scheme .    to begin the calculation ,",
    "at each radial point we inject an initial spectrum .",
    "these spectra are either a delta - function source at the lowest radius , for measuring the single - photon response , or the expected spectra emitted by a single beam particle as it passes through each radial bin , for a full physical cascade . in the second case , the spectrum is adjusted to prevent binning effects from affecting the total power injected .    using the expression @xmath180 , equation ( [ eq : tau_infty ] ) ,",
    "we find which photons are absorbed within the magnetosphere , and which escape .",
    "the escaping photons are simply accumulated .",
    "the absorbed photons are assumed to be absorbed at @xmath181 , or at a radius of @xmath182 .",
    "each photon energy from each radial bin is absorbed at a different height ; these final heights are then simply re - binned into the grid .    for each absorbed photon , equation ( [ eq : synch_n ] ) is used to determine the synchrotron spectrum injected at the absorption point .",
    "this process is then iterated , to find the secondaries produced by those synchrotron photons , and so on , until the energy remaining in synchrotron photons is negligible .",
    "these calculations are streamlined by pre - calculating the synchrotron response matrices , @xmath183 , and the total absorption , @xmath184 , at each altitude .",
    "in addition , the radial absorption matrix , @xmath185 , is computed for each energy , reducing each step of the iteration to a series of matrix multiplications .",
    "figures [ fig : harding_gamma ] and [ fig : harding_pairs ] show , respectively , the final @xmath2-ray and pair spectra for both this model and the monte carlo model of @xcite .",
    "the predicted @xmath2-ray spectra match extremely well , while the pair spectra mismatch at low energies , due to the low resolution of the monte carlo method in that range , and at high energies , due to the approximation in this model of treating @xmath68 as a constant , rather than allowing it to vary with photon energy .",
    "to understand the cascade process itself , we first examine the response to a single photon of injected into the magnetosphere at the surface of the star . physically , the resultant cascade depends on the energy of the input photon , the local magnetic field strength , and the local radius of curvature of the field lines .      from the discussion of the optical depth , we know that only photons emitted at radius @xmath26 with energies less than @xmath186 will escape the magnetosphere . due to the decline of the magnetic field with @xmath26",
    ", @xmath123 steadily increases with altitude .    however , the cascade produced by a single injected high - energy photon remains localized .",
    "if there are multiple generations of pair production , the photon energy must be greater than @xmath187 , from equation ( [ eq : e_generations ] ) , which pair - produces in @xmath188 .",
    "since @xmath68 is on the order of 20 , this distance is short compared to @xmath25 , and the magnetic field remains effectively unchanged .",
    "hence , we may treat the cascade process as if it occurred on - the - spot , and the energy cut - off remains at @xmath189 .",
    "the typical synchrotron response has a power - law exponent @xmath190 , extending from energy @xmath191 to @xmath192 , and a power - law exponent of @xmath193 , the typical value for synchrotron radiation , for lower energies .",
    "after processing through multiple generations , this translates to an output spectrum with @xmath194 up to @xmath195 and @xmath196 from there to @xmath123 .",
    "figure [ fig : gamma_for_various_es ] shows the gamma - ray spectra produced by various input energies .",
    "this demonstrates the expected cut - off at @xmath123 , as well as the transition from a power - law exponent of @xmath197 to @xmath198 at @xmath195 .",
    "the shape of the spectrum is different at low energies , due to the effects of the exponential tails of the opacity and synchrotron emission , but it quickly converges to the asymptotic form .",
    "since the total photon energy at each pair - production event is roughly conserved , cascades in low- and mid - field pulsars effectively convert high - energy photons into photons with energy @xmath123 . at the penultimate generation of an extended cascade ,",
    "however , a significant fraction of the synchrotron photons have @xmath199 and escape . from the @xmath197 synchrotron power law and",
    "using the expected multiplicity power - law dependence on energy , equation ( [ eq : mult_power_law ] ) , we expect a final multiplicity of @xmath200 with @xmath177 as given in equation ( [ eq : nu ] ) .    for pulsars with moderate and low fields , @xmath201 ,",
    "the quantity @xmath159 is large , a negligible fraction of the energy of each absorbed photon is left in the generated pair , and @xmath202 , yielding a simple linear relation between input photon energy and final pair multiplicity .    in the opposite regime ,",
    "very high fields , @xmath159 is small , so the generated pair retains almost all of the initial photon energy , and there is little or no cascade ; high - energy photons simply transmute into high-@xmath2 particles .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ratio_mult ] , we plot the numerically calculated energy dependence of the total multiplicity along with the theoretical results .",
    "the simplest multiplicity formula , equation ( [ eq : m_tot ] ) with the exponent @xmath177 set to 1 , works well for magnetic fields below @xmath0 gauss , but over - estimates the multiplicity for higher fields , due to the increase in the amount of energy left in the particles in the higher - field cascades . for all magnetic fields , the spectrum has three well - defined regions . if @xmath199 , the initial photon is below threshold , and no pairs are produced .",
    "if @xmath203 , the initial photon will pair produce , but all of the secondary synchrotron photons have energies below @xmath123 and create no further pairs . finally , for @xmath204 , both the initial photon and the secondary synchrotron photons may create pairs , producing a smoothly increasing multiplicity .",
    "figure [ fig : power_law_bs ] shows this change in the power - law exponent with magnetic field , along with the theoretical result , equation ( [ eq : nu ] ) .",
    "the approximation closely matches the numerical results over the entire dynamic range .    from equation ( [ eq : mult_s_power_law ] )",
    ", we expect that the spatial development of the cascade should be a similar power - law in space . to find a closer approximation , we use an argument akin to that for the final multiplicity .",
    "since the first several generations of a high - energy cascade occur in the high - energy regime where equation ( [ eq : dr_a ] ) applies , the cascade develops as if @xmath171 were the minimum energy , only deviating when the photon energy drops near @xmath123 .",
    "hence , a good approximation to the high - energy cascade is @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the propagation distance from the emission point , @xmath207 is the point at which the initial photon pair produces , @xmath208 , @xmath177 is given in equation ( [ eq : nu ] ) , and the factor of @xmath209 follows from the truncation of the cascade at @xmath123 rather than @xmath171 .",
    "examining the numerical results , shown in figure [ fig : spatial_cascade ] , we found that , indeed , the pair production rate follows this rule very well .",

    "the lower limit of the pair spectra is at @xmath218 , which is independent of @xmath3 , provided that @xmath219 .",
    "the upper limit is a fixed multiple of this value , and so remains constant as well .",
    "the analytic models of paper i did not take into account the variation of the power - law exponent , @xmath177 , with magnetic field .",
    "this does not affect the calculation of either the curvature or the resonant ics cascades , since those mechanisms operate primarily on the primary photons , but the decline of @xmath177 with @xmath3 limits the effectiveness of non - resonant ics for magnetic fields above @xmath0 gauss .",
    "allowing for the change of the power law makes the analytic form impractical , but we can quantify the approximation by using a simple numerical model .",
    "if we still assume that all photons emitted by a given emission mechanism are emitted at the peak energy and use equation ( [ eq : mult_s_approx ] for the spatial range of pair - production , we can calculate the location of the pff .    in practice , we find that this method yields results which are nearly indistinguishable from the full numerical method , in the regime where the full numerical method predicts a finite pff height . in figure",

    ", we slightly adjust the peak amplitude of each injected spectrum to compensate for the effects of the discrete energy grid .",
    "we run the model multiple times .",
    "first , given an assumed polar cap temperature , we run it as described above to find the pair formation front altitude , namely the altitude at which @xmath221 pairs have been produced per primary .",
    "at this point the pair plasma is sufficiently dense to short out the accelerating electric field .",
    "we then recompute the lorentz factor of the beam , with acceleration halting at the pff , inject the new spectra , and follow the cascade to produce the final output @xmath2-ray and pair spectra .",
    "a typical output pair spectrum is shown in figure [ fig : pairs_1952 ] , and a typical output @xmath2-ray spectrum in figure [ fig : gamma_1952 ] .",
    "these show many of the characteristics of the single - photon response .",
    "the pair spectrum shows the rapid rise , @xmath196 power - law , and exponential tail , but it also shows a low - amplitude tail of high - energy particles , due to the effects of inverse compton scattering .    for most pulsars , the final pair and @xmath2-ray spectra are similar to those in figures ( [ fig : pairs_1952 ] ) and ( [ fig : gamma_1952 ] ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : contour ] , we plot the multiplicity as a function of pulsar period and cap potential for a fixed stellar temperature of @xmath220 k. given that fixed temperature , most pulsars have multiplicities ranging from 0.1100 , while most of the millisecond pulsars have lower multiplicities . in figure",
    "[ fig : contour_rho ] , we set the radius of curvature of the field lines equal to the stellar radius , in order to model roughly the effects of an offset dipole . here , most pulsars have multiplicities in the range of 101000 , while the msps remain with significantly lower multiplicities .",
    "however , a parallel offset of the dipole moment would also increase the surface field , effectively increasing the cap potential .",
    "given the sharp gradient in multiplicities at low-@xmath33 , this could easily bring the multiplicities of the msps into parity with those of the other pulsars .",
    "this paper has given several approximations and descriptions of the pair creation process in pulsars , in the hopes that they will be useful for other researchers examining these objects .",
    "the development of the pair cascade in space is deceptively simple , a fact which has been used in paper i to obtain several useful results about the regimes of dominance of the various emission mechanisms .",
    "a more detailed model , maintaining the variability of the power - law exponent , produces qualitatively identical results .",
    "many pulsars have their pff set by non - resonant ics , with curvature dominating at high potential , and resonant ics at high magnetic field .    in addition ,",
    "due to the effects of nrics , many pulsars seem to operate with comparatively low pair multiplicities .",
    "the total @xmath222 is in the range of 110 more often than it is in the 1000 s predicted by curvature models .",
    "the ots approximation to the pair cascade describes the spectrum of @xmath2-rays and particles produced by the pair production process very well , although the ots pair spectrum underestimates the number of low energy pairs , due to the decline of the magnetic field with altitude .",
    "the full cascade model may be used to predict the @xmath2-ray and pair spectra of individual pulsars .",
    "although the pair spectrum produced will be modified by rics , the high - energy @xmath2-ray spectrum predicted should be observable .",
    "the @xmath2-ray output from pulsars will be the subject of a subsequent paper .",
    "we wish to acknowledge the assistance of alice harding , who provided the data for the comparisons of figures [ fig : harding_gamma ] and [ fig : harding_pairs ] .",
    "for convenience , we describe the forms of the various emission mechanisms used in the numerical calculations .",
    "the chief difference between the physical situations considered by @xcite and conditions in the pulsar magnetosphere is that the background x - rays in pulsars are not isotropic . they originate from the hot surface of the star itself and only occupy a range in @xmath23 from @xmath227 to at most @xmath228 . in terms of @xmath229 ,",
    "thermal photons are emitted with angles from 1 to @xmath230 , where @xmath231 where @xmath159 is the radius of the polar cap , typically @xmath232 , and @xmath233 is the height above the stellar surface . for simplicity ,",
    "we only consider emission along the @xmath233-axis , where the incoming photons are symmetric in @xmath155 .",
    "the range of @xmath234 populated with photons is then @xmath235    for the isotropic case , @xmath236 .",
    "if @xmath237 , the simplest consequence is that there are fewer photons , by a factor of @xmath238 , potentially scattering off of the particle .",
    "furthermore , these photons are concentrated near @xmath239 , so the mean energy of the photons in the particle rest frame is reduced .    from @xcite ,",
    "the full non - resonant inverse compton cross section is @xmath240 the primed frame is the particle rest frame , the unprimed frame is fixed to the neutron star itself , and the subscript @xmath241 indicates the scattered particles and angles .",
    "we have made the approximation that all of the incoming photons in the particle rest frame are beamed down the @xmath233-axis , so that the angle between the incoming and the scattered photon is simply equal to the latitude of the scattered photon , @xmath242 .",
    "this approximation works very well for large lorentz factors , but is less accurate in the thomson regime .",
    "however , it gives negligible error in the klein - nishina regime .",
    "the limits of the @xmath12 integration are set by which energies may be scattered such that they have energy @xmath251 in the rest frame .",
    "the minimum possible energy is @xmath252 , while the maximum is @xmath253 , where the approximations assume that @xmath254 .",
    "the source function we adopt is that of a black - body , emitting at temperature t in units of @xmath13 , into a range of solid angle @xmath255 .",
    "this corresponds to a specific intensity of @xmath256 where @xmath257 for @xmath258 , and @xmath259 otherwise .            approximating this further by replacing @xmath270 with its average over the range , @xmath271 , and performing the integral yields @xmath272 where @xmath273 where @xmath274 is the dilogarithm function , defined as @xmath275 the dilogarithm , @xmath276 for small @xmath277 , and @xmath278 .",
    "the angle average , @xmath271 , clearly lies between 0 and 1 .",
    "its value is given by @xmath279 where @xmath280 adopting the approximate forms of @xmath281 and @xmath282 does not perceptibly change the value of the integral , but reduces @xmath283 to being a function only of the single parameter @xmath222 .",
    "a good approximation to the value of @xmath284 is @xmath285 for the computation , we simply tabulate @xmath271 .",
    "the power emitted by the scattering has two asymptotic limits . if @xmath286 , then emitted power matches the thomson value , @xmath287 while if @xmath288 , the emitted power is approximately @xmath289 which matches the klein - nishina limit of @xcite when @xmath236 .",
    "the transition between the two limits is purely a function of @xmath290 .",
