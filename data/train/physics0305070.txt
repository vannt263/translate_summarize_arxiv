    "the available range in @xmath1 which is linked to the electron s scattering angle is limited by the inner radius of the spacal which corresponds to a minimal @xmath1 of roughly 0.6 gev@xmath0 . therefore , a large area in phase space can not be accessed by h1 without the help of a dedicated device , see fig .",

    "therefore , @xmath12 corresponds to vanishing , @xmath13 to maximal photon energy .",
    "the region below the spacal - covered @xmath1 range is of special interest because here the dis and photoproduction regimes merge : the `` transition region '' .",
    "a measurement of the structure function @xmath14 , or equivalently of the total photo - absorption cross section @xmath15 in this region is expected to shed light on the interplay between soft and hard processes in electron - proton scattering .",

    "the vlq calorimeter , which does not distinguish between high energy electrons and photons , can also serve to measure photons from meson decays , e.g. from @xmath22 or @xmath23 mesons , or from heavier particles which decay through these intermediate states . a field which gained new interest",
    "is meson production via `` odderon '' exchange , where the odderon is the @xmath24 partner of the pomeron .",
    "odderon - mediated reactions are expected to lead to high energy single meson production in the `` photon hemisphere '' , that is in the electron beam direction @xcite .",
    "the vlq is an ideal target for photons from these meson decays @xcite .",
    "the vlq spectrometer consists of two independent modules , each comprising a tracker system and an electromagnetic calorimeter , followed by a time - of - flight ( tof ) system which has the purpose to recognize background particles travelling along with the proton beam .",
    "the phase space region to be covered dictates the position of the vlq to be downstream the electron beam and close to the beam pipe .",
    "the space available to install a new detecting device there is strongly limited , enforcing a very tight structure , and especially a highly compact calorimeter .",
    "the solution chosen is a system of two identical spectrometer modules , one above and one below the beam line , fixed to a moving mechanics so that the modules can be moved close to the beam , or retracted , independently .",
    "the tracker part and the tof system connected to the vlq spectrometer are described in @xcite .",
    "the volume available for either vlq calorimeter module is a box of 16.3 cm length and transverse dimensions of 15.0 x 18.0 cm@xmath0 .",
    "the calorimeter operates in an energy range up to the electron beam energy , i.e. roughly 30 gev .",
    "the energy resolution aimed at in this regime is 3 - 4 % .",
    "a material capable to absorb electromagnetic showers of this energy within the given distance is tungsten , with z = 72 and a density of 19.3 g/@xmath26 .",
    "a sandwich calorimeter type was chosen in a sophisticated layout which allows a `` projective energy read - out '' , i.e. a fourfold projection of the shower profile can be measured along the shower detector : a passive tungsten   plate of 2.5 mm thickness is followed by an active scintillator layer of 3 mm thickness , structured in an array of 24 vertical scintillator bars of 5 mm width each ; this double layer is continued by another tungsten plate and another scintillator layer , arranged in 18 horizontal scintillator bars of the same width . in total",
    "there are 23 tungsten and 24 scintillator layers .",
    "the scintillation light which is guided by total reflection is read out at either end of each bar , and coupled into a wavelength shifter which guides the light towards photodiode detectors .",
    "detection devices positioned very close to the beam pipe are exposed to high doses of synchrotron radiation and background generated by the proton beam . in order to protect the vlq from background radiation , a moving mechanism retracts the spectrometer from the beam pipe during the filling phase .",
    "this condition renders a full @xmath27 coverage in azimuth more difficult and leaves a two module solution : one module above , and another identical one below the beam pipe , fixed to the retraction mechanism which moves the modules to well defined measuring positions .",
    "the parameters of the calorimeter described below always refer to a pair of modules .",
    "the structure of a calorimeter module is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : calofront ] , an `` exploded view '' is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : explov ] .",
    "the scintillation material chosen is bicron bc-408 with a wavelength of maximum emission of 425 nm , a decay time of the scintillation light of 2.1 ns , and a refractive index of 1.58  @xcite .",
    "given the available space and the absorber and scintillator materials , the internal structure of the calorimeter module has to be optimized .",
    "the total length being fixed , the parameters to be varied are number and thickness of tungsten vs. scintillator plates .",
    "the optimization procedure was carried out using the simulation package geant @xcite .",
    "the optimization criterion is derived from the behaviour of the relative energy resolution @xmath28 which is conventionally expanded in powers of @xmath29 : @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is the so called `` sampling term '' governed by poisson statistics of shower sampling .",
    "@xmath32 is called the `` constant term '' saying that the absolute energy resolution @xmath33 worsens with increasing energy .",
    "it is mainly due to incomplete shower containment and strongly dependent on the calorimeter size .",
    "@xmath34 is the noise term which is not a property of the calorimeter body itself but given by the readout system .",
    "it has the same influence on the absolute resolution at any energy , i.e. it is independent of energy .",
    "optimization of the mechanical layout of the calorimeter can be decoupled from the electronic read - out @xcite . to find the best solution ,",
    "a series of simulations was performed where the tungsten and scintillator layer thicknesses were varied @xcite .",
    "the electron impact energies were 5 , 15 and 25 gev . a curve corresponding to eq .",
    "1 was fit to the simulated energy distribution without the noise term which has not been simulated .",
    "the optimal solution , a tungsten layer thickness of 2.5 mm and a scintillator layer thickness of 3 mm , resulted in the following expression for the energy resolution :    @xmath35    a parameter for the noise term could not be derived from the simulation but was obtained from an independent investigation of the read - out chip , see @xcite and below ( section 2.4 ) .",
    "an equivalent investigation was made in order to determine the optimal width of the scintillator strips .",
    "a good spatial resolution is clearly in favour of a small width , but implies a larger number of read - out channels and a smaller light yield per scintillator , with increased relative noise contributions .",
    "the compromise found was a width of 5 mm resulting in a ( one dimensional ) spatial resolution of 1.4 mm at 5 gev .",
    "the resolution improves to below 1 mm for higher energies due to reduced shower fluctuations .",
    "another important property of any calorimeter is the relation between input energy and measured response .",
    "deviations from linearity lead to systematic uncertainties and deteriorate the effective energy resolution .",
    "the simulation study on the optimized vlq calorimeter shows deviations from linearity below one percent which are a consequence of the compactness of the calorimeter body and corresponding leakage effects at high energies , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lineasim ] .",
    "following the simulation results , the calorimeter in its structure as described above represents an `` electromagnetic depth '' of 16.7 radiation lengths and has a molire radius ( the radius of a cylinder containing on the average 90 % of the shower energy ) of 1.25 cm .",
    "the two modules of the calorimeter need to be retracted during the beam filling phase in order to protect the silicon tracking device from synchrotron and background radiation . with the help of the moving mechanics , the radiation load of the vlq tracking system",
    "can be reduced by a factor of more than 20 .",
    "the moving apparatus delivers a ( vertical ) position information which is read out and continuously stored after every move - in / move - out procedure .",
    "its accuracy is of the same order as that of the tracker , i.e. a few @xmath36 m .",
    "the vlq calorimeter modules , including the electronic read - out systems , are accomodated in a solid brass housing each , with wall thicknesses of 8 mm ( side walls ) , 5 mm ( front and back walls ) , and 2 mm ( bottom wall , i.e. the wall closest to the beam pipe ) .",
    "thus , sufficient protection against synchrotron radiation is provided . inside a module ,",
    "another 10 mm thick brass plate is mounted directly above the active volume which accomodates the cooling water tubing system : the water serves to cool an air stream which continually flows around the electronics boards .",
    "the tracker modules are fixed to the calorimeter modules , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : vlqlayout ] .",
    "the vlq spectrometer is situated as close to the beam line as possible in order to catch electrons and photons scattered or produced at very small angles .",
    "this requires a modification to the beam pipe because even a thin but straight cylindrical pipe would force particles to traverse a large amount of material .",
    "the shape of the beam pipe with its changing diameter is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beampipe ] .",
    "the pipe is made of aluminium , and the material in front of the vlq corresponds to less than one radiation length .",
    "after the considerations sketched above , the structure and granularity of the scintillation and light transport system are fixed : the calorimeter has 24 scintillator layers , 12 vertically and 12 horizontally structured ones .",
    "each vertically structured layer consists of 24 bars , each horizontally structured one consists of 18 bars .",
    "an exploded view of the calorimeter structure is displayed in fig . [",
    "fig : explov ] .",
    "the active , scintillating layers are interleaved with 23 passive , tungsten layers .",
    "the very first and very last passive layer are represented by the front and back brass housing walls .",
    "each scintillator strip is read out at either side by a wavelength shifter ( wls ) bar  @xcite which collects and sums the light from 24 strips : in total , there are 2 x ( 18 + 24 ) = 84 wls bars per module .",
    "each wls bar is read out by a photodiode at either end so that 168 photodiodes are needed per module .",
    "each surface plane of a calorimeter module is read out in this manner , so that four independent transverse shower projections are available .",
    "the wavelength shifters are located close to each other with a distance of only 0.2 mm .",
    "consequently , the use of a single photodiode with its own housing for an individual wls is not possible . instead ,",
    "especially manufactured photodiode arrays which match the dimensions of the wls arrays were employed .",
    "there are two kinds of arrays , one with 18 and one with 24 diodes , each implanted in a common p - substrate , corresponding to the transverse structure of the calorimeter with its two different sets of read - out channels .",
    "the size of the active area of a single diode is 4.2 x 3.4 mm@xmath0 .",
    "the distance between the active areas is 0.8 mm .",
    "the diode arrays are protected by a glass surface of 0.5 mm thickness .",
    "the determination of shower energy and shower position is based on the evaluation of the transverse shower profiles .",
    "any effect which disturbs the primary `` physical '' profile has to be avoided or at least minimized .",
    "one such effect ist optical cross talk between adjacent scintillator strips : scintillation light induced in one channel reaches neighbouring ones and thus distorts the primary profile . to avoid this ,",
    "each scintillator strip was wrapped in individually prepared and cut white paper .",
    "each scintillator strip matches with either end its wls bar .",
    "scintillator and wls have the same refractive index ( n = 1.58 ) so that an intimate contact would be desirable to minimize light losses .",
    "since this contact could only be established manually by gluing which inevitably leads to non - uniform connections , scintillator and wls were separated by a 0.2 mm wide gap which is maintained by a nylon thread .",
    "the wls strips guide the light directly onto the photodiode surfaces .",
    "scintillator and wls materials are selected to match the sensitivity and quantum efficiency of the photodiodes .",
    "the scintillator s wavelength of maximum emission is 425 nm ; its light is shifted by 100 nm towards larger wavelengths ( from `` blue '' to `` green '' ) when re - emitted by the wls .",
    "the photodiode reaches a modest sensitivity but high quantum efficiency at this wavelength , see fig .",
    "[ fig : photodio ] .",
    "finally , the glue between wls and glass surfaces ( n = 1.50 ) of the photodiodes was chosen as an epoxid resin with a refractive index of n = 1.56 which means nearly optimal matching .",
    "its transparency in the wavelength range of the wls is larger than 99 % .",
    "the attenuation length of a scintillator slab of dimensions 1 x 20 x 200 @xmath26 is 210 cm @xcite .",
    "this changes drastically for scintillator strips of dimensions used for the vlq calorimeter , namely 3 x 5 x 90 ( 120 ) mm@xmath37 . in these very thin",
    "strips the number of reflections which scintillation light undergoes , and consequently the net light loss , is much larger .",
    "a measurement of the attenuation @xcite results in a parametrization by a sum of two exponential functions : the region close to the exit surface is governed by a very small attenuation length of 2.7 mm , the region towards the scintillator centre is described by an attenuation length of 101 mm .",
    "the efficiency of light transmission from scintillators to wavelength shifters is between 80 % and 90 % , the light collection efficiency of the wls is about 50 % @xcite . in total , a fraction of 5 - 10 % of the light induced by an electromagnetic shower is collected onto the photodiodes .    a survey of the technical parameters of the vlq calorimeter is given in table  1 .",
    ".technical parameters of the vlq calorimeter .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]      in order to calibrate the vlq calorimeter during the standard experimental data taking phase and at high energies , the observation of the `` kinematical peak '' in electron - proton scattering is exploited : in the energy spectrum of electrons scattered off protons with moderate @xmath1 , a peak appears at the position of the incident electron beam energy .",
    "the response of a calorimeter can be adjusted accordingly .",
    "the calibration proceeds in several steps : after selecting the kinematical peak events , a channel - to - channel intercalibration is performed in order to homogenize channel responses .",
    "this is followed by adjusting the absolute energy scale in terms of position dependent calibration factors .",
    "events to be used for the kinematical peak calibration must fulfil the following selection criteria : the electron must deposit an energy above the highest trigger threshold in one of the calorimeter modules ; the value of the `` inelasticity '' @xmath8 reconstructed following the prescription by jacquet and blondel @xcite which indicates hadronic energy deposition in the central calorimeter must obey @xmath38 ; as at hera the electron beam energy is @xmath39 , only clusters with energies @xmath40 are accepted .",
    "a requirement of the reconstruction software is that exactly one cluster and no sd channel was found , or at least no sd channel which is connected to the cluster .",
    "the aim of the channel - to - channel intercalibration is to ensure that equal energy depositions result in equal responses of all channels .",
    "variations in the channel energy responses can have different sources , the most important ones are due to optical and electronical cross talk .",
    "the optical cross talk is due to light emission into neighbouring photodiodes , caused by overlapping light cones in the thin glass pane between wavelength shifters and photodiode surfaces .",
    "the channel - to - channel calibration is a two step procedure whose principle has been sketched in section 4.1 .",
    "the algorithm used for the normal calibration is briefly described below :    in a first step the signal of the channel with the maximum energy deposition is filled into a histogram associated to that specific channel , and the mean for each channel is determined . in order to calculate calibration factors , a reference value is needed which in this case is the `` mean of ( the above defined ) means '' , averaged over all channels belonging to one wavelength shifter array . this procedure is expressed in the following equation : @xmath41 here , @xmath42 is the number of channels entering the average after the first iteration , and @xmath43 is the mean value of the histogram which contains the measured energies of channel @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 is the global mean in an given wavelength shifter array for the first iteration .",
    "the effect of the calibration is such that after applying the first iteration calibration constants @xmath46 the mean energy in any channel is shifted to the global mean .",
    "this procedure is then repeated until the change in the mean energy of any channel with respect to the previous iteration is smaller than @xmath47% .",
    "the second intercalibration iteration has the purpose to correct for inhomogeneities caused by optical cross talk between adjacent wavelength shifter bars , which is of the order of @xmath48% @xcite .",
    "it is performed after the calibration factors of the first step have been applied .",
    "the procedure is identical to the previous one with the exception that this time the `` maximum channel '' energy plus two `` left '' and two `` right '' neighbours are summed up and filled into the histogram . in this way , with the iterations carried out as in step one , the `` light sharing '' between neighbouring channels due to optical cross talk is taken into account .",
    "the distribution of the calibration factors resulting from this procedure , for the first of the two calorimeter modules , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kanalabgleich ] .",
    "the distribution for the second module is similar @xcite . the channels with calibration factors close to 2 suffered from a broken light connection at one end .",
    "the calibration has to result in correction factors which ensure that the energy response for a given particle energy is the same for all possible impact positions .",
    "this was partly done in the intercalibration steps described above , but due to the light collection effects mentioned and described in section 2.3 , the regions close to the calorimeter edges are not covered yet . therefore in the final step of the calibration procedure",
    "the absolute energy scale in terms of position dependent calibration factors is determined .",
    "this correction becomes especially important for impact positions close to the calorimeter edges where parts of the deposited energy leak out of the active calorimeter volume into transverse direction , and where scintillator light yield effects play an important role @xcite .",
    "after homogenizing the individual channel responses , the absolute energy scale and the position dependend calibration factors are determined .    to homogenize the detector response , the detector surface is subdivided into segments of @xmath49 in the central region , and @xmath50 bins close to the edges where the response depends strongly on the distance from the calorimeter edge .",
    "the mean energy @xmath51 , averaged over all events reconstructed in that bin , is calculated .",
    "the calibration factor @xmath52 is calculated by normalizing the mean energy in the bin @xmath53 to the known hera kinematical peak energy of @xmath39 : @xmath54    the calibration constants have been determined from h1 data for the channels providing sufficient statistics . the mean value of the constants is 1.125 with an r.m.s .",
    "spread of 0.040 .      for the kinematical peak calibration",
    "two data samples were used , namely from april 1999 and from september - october 1999 . the energy resolution after calibration , as a function of energy and from both test beam and kinematical peak data , is displayed in fig . [",
    "fig : resolution1 ] . using the available data at lower and high energies , an energy resolution parametrized as    @xmath55    is derived .",
    "the individual contributions from sampling term , constant term , and noise term are indicated in the figure .    when compared to the parametrization of the resolution curve obtained from test beam data ( eq .",
    "8) , a significant increase of the noise term is observed .",
    "this is a consequence of the electronic environment present in the h1 experimental hall which is very much different from the situation in the test beam area .",
    "the additional point taken at the hera electron beam energy constrains the fit at high energy so that the constant term can be determined with high accuracy .",
    "no such measurement was available in the test beam .",
    "the sampling term is consistent with both that obtained from a simulation ( eq .",
    "2 ) and from the low energy test beam data .",
    "during its two years of operation in the h1 experiment at hera , the main purpose of the vlq spectrometer was the detection of high energy electrons and photons in the context of structure function measurements @xcite and meson spectroscopy .",
    "the performance of the calorimeter is demonstrated best with purely electromagnetic interactions where no other h1 detector component is involved , e.g. with wide angle bremsstrahlung events , also called `` qed compton ( qed - c ) '' events @xcite , i.e. @xmath56    a striking feature of qedc events is , due to the generally very small four - momentum transfer to the target proton , the coplanarity of the final state electron and photon : in the transverse detector plane ( `` r - @xmath19 - plane '' ) photon and electron momentum vector components are back - to - back . in addition",
    ", the sum of photon and final state electron energy must equal the initial electron beam energy .",
    "the vlq calorimeter is ideally suited to test these properties ( or , to profit from them because they can be used for calibration and alignment purposes as described in @xcite ) .",
    "the performance of the calorimeter is demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : qedc1 ] and [ fig : qedc2 ] , taken from @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig : qedc1 ] shows the sum of final state electron and photon energies , together with the result of a simulation , and fig .",
    "[ fig : qedc2 ] shows the azimuth angular difference , shifted by @xmath57 , of photon and electron impact points , again compared to a simulation .",
    "apparently , the calorimeter behaved as expected .            in the context of an analysis searching for single @xmath22 s produced in the h1 backward region @xcite ,",
    "two - photon pairs were collected and investigated for a signal , where either both photons had to be detected in the vlq calorimeter , or one photon in the vlq and the other one in the spacal backward calorimeter .",
    "the low cross section , in combination with special kinematic restrictions , did not leave a sizeable signal for the vlq - vlq case alone .",
    "a clear @xmath22 signal was observed , however , if the combination vlq - spacal is added , see fig . [",
    "fig : twogam ] where a fit of a gaussian function to the @xmath22 peak plus a polynomial for the background is superimposed .",
    "the @xmath22 peak is shifted towards a mass larger than the pdg value , and appears broader than expected for both spacal and vlq mass resolutions @xcite .",
    "there are several reasons responsible for these effects : first , the position of the actual interaction vertex is not known because there are no charged particle tracks in these events , and four - momenta have to be reconstructed using the nominal vertex position .",
    "second , both the spacal and vlq calibrations were performed with the help of the `` kinematical peak '' , i.e. with electrons of an energy close to the incident electron beam energy ( see section 4.2 ) while photons from @xmath22 decays have much smaller energies .",
    "third , no dedicated intercalibration was performed between the spacal and vlq calorimeters . in spite of these limitations ,",
    "the capability of the vlq to contribute to the reconstruction of @xmath22 s from their decays to two photons is convincingly demonstrated .",
    "the very low @xmath58 calorimeter of h1 , a highly compact device designed to measure high energetic electrons and photons in the electron beam downstream region , was succcessfully operated in the 1999 and 2000 data taking periods .",
    "the performance in the experiment was very close to that expected from design and simulations .",
    "the vlq calorimeter contributed significantly to measurements of the proton structure function @xmath59 in phase space regions previously unaccessible for h1 , and opened a new kinematical regime for the spectroscopy of mesons decaying to purely photonic final states .",
