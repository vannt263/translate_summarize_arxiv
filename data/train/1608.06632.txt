    "strong spin - orbit coupling is the fundamental origin of several topological phases of matter , such as topological insulators and superconductors in two and three spatial dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the salient features of these systems are ( i ) an insulating bulk ( electrical or thermal ) and ( ii ) topologically protected metallic surface states ( which could be superconducting depending on the situation ) . among such gapless phases , the ones ( so - called weyl materials ) formed by chiral weyl fermions",

    "weyl fermions may result from complex band structures in strong spin - orbit coupled semiconductors  @xcite , multilayer heterostructures  @xcite and they can also be found inside a broken symmetry phase in strongly correlated materials , such as 227 pyrochlore iridates , as emergent quasiparticles  @xcite . the weyl semimetals ( wsms ) can be classified into two broad categories .",
    "( i ) inversion ( @xmath4 ) symmetry breaking wsms that are commonly found in weakly correlated semiconductors , and ( ii ) time - reversal ( @xmath5 ) odd wsms that can be found in strongly correlated materials with comparable strength of spin - orbit coupling and electronic interaction .",
    "however , irrespective of the microscopic origin , wsms are composed of weyl nodes in the reciprocal space , where kramers non - degenerate valence and conduction bands touch each other at the so - called diabolic points in the momentum space  @xcite .",
    "the weyl nodes act as the source ( monopole ) and sink ( anti - monopole ) of abelian berry flux , and in its close vicinity , weyl fermions can be identified as left ( right ) chiral fermions .",
    "a _ no - go theorem _ guarantees the existence of an equal number of left and right chiral fermions in the system  @xcite .",
    "the monopole charge ( @xmath0 ) also dictates the amount of berry flux enclosed by a plane perpendicular to the line joining these two points and in turn defines the _ integer topological invariant _ of the system .",
    "thus monopole charge permits a topological classification of weyl semimetals , and for @xmath1 and @xmath2 we can call them single , double and triple wsm , respectively .",
    "the most common weyl system has just @xmath6 whereas the system with arbitrary @xmath0 can be regarded as a generalized weyl system .",
    "( in the current work we consider magnetotransport in single , double , and triple wsms although our theory is generalizable to even higher values of @xmath0 , but it is well - known that weyl systems with monopole charge @xmath7 is not allowed in three - dimensional lattice systems , and therefore our work applies to all possible physical weyl materials that can be studied in the laboratory ) .",
    "the dispersion of weyl quasiparticles in these systems along various high symmetry directions is shown in fig .",
    "[ dispersion ] . although the weyl nodes are often accompanied by _",
    "monopole charge , it is nonetheless conceivable to realize weyl nodes with higher integer charge and the system with arbitrary @xmath0 can be regarded as a generalized weyl system , such as the proposed double wsm in hgcr@xmath8se@xmath9 and srsi@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "even though , the material existence of a triple wsm has remained elusive so far , with the anticipated progress of materials science the discovery of such a generalized triple wsm is certainly possible .",
    "it is well known that weyl systems with monopole charge @xmath7 is not allowed in three - dimensional lattice systems  @xcite , and therefore our work applies to all possible physical weyl materials that can be studied in the laboratory .",
    "most , if essentially not all , of the substantial theoretical literature on wsms have focused on the single wsm because the existing experimental materials are all wsms with @xmath6 .",
    "on the other hand , there are significant differences in the properties of generalized wsms depending on their monopole charges , necessitating theoretical studies of multi - wsms with higher ( @xmath10 ) values of monopole charges , which is what we do in the current work considering @xmath11 and @xmath2 , and contrasting their properties with @xmath6 wsm ( and with each other ) .",
    "the integer topological invariant also determines various thermodynamic , transport , and topological properties of a wsm .",
    "for example , one of the hallmark signatures of a wsm is the presence of topologically protected _ fermi arc _  @xcite that has recently been seen through angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurements  @xcite . in a multi - wsm the fermi arc bears additional @xmath0 fold degeneracy , where @xmath0 is the monopole charge of weyl nodes .",
    "therefore , in double and triple wsms , the fermi arc respectively possesses two and three fold orbital degeneracies , which , for example , can be detected in arpes and stm .",
    "we here explore the ramifications of the underlying topological invariant of a pristine wsm , when the system is placed in a strong magnetic field .",
    "our findings are the following .    1 .",
    "when placed in a strong magnetic field , wsms undergo landau level ( ll ) quantization , supporting _ exactly _",
    "@xmath0 number of zeroth landau levels ( zlls ) , irrespective of the field orientation ( within continuum approximation ) .",
    "all lls , including the zeroth ones , disperse along the direction of the applied field .",
    "thus , the orbital degeneracy of zll ( @xmath0 ) gets tied with the monopole charge or topological invariant of the weyl nodes .",
    "2 .   even though @xmath0 dispersive zlls always go through zero energy ( in the continuum limit ) , they are in general non - degenerate , unless the field is applied along the axis on which weyl nodes reside in the absence of the field [ see figs .",
    "[ ll_dw_general ] and [ ll_tw_general ] ] .",
    "3 .   density of states ( dos ) displays nontrivial dependence ( such as its periodicity ) on the tilting angle of the magnetic field away from a high symmetry direction , separating the weyl nodes [ see figs .  [",
    "fig : dos_dw ] and [ fig : dos_tw ] ] .",
    "such intriguing features can be observed in _ angle resolved _ quantum oscillation measurements  @xcite .",
    "direction in any weyl semimetal .",
    "dispersion in the @xmath12 plane respectively for ( b ) single , ( c ) double and ( d ) triple weyl semimetals .",
    "notice that @xmath13 , where @xmath0 is the monopole charge and @xmath14 , but @xmath15 in all weyl semimetals.,width=302,height=226 ]    a strong magnetic field causes an _ effective _ reduction of the dimensionality of the system .",
    "in particular , each branch of zlls cuts the zero energy ( where the fermi energy is pinned ) at two isolated points in the brillouin zone , yielding two field - induced weyl nodes , around which the quasiparticles are once again described as one - dimensional chiral ( left and right ) fermions ( we note that the effective reduction of a generic three dimensional electron system to an apparent one dimensional electron gas along the magnetic field direction is of course a well - known effect of the strong field limit where ll coupling can be ignored  for wsms this dimensional reduction leads to effectively chiral one dimensional fermion systems ) . if an electric field ( @xmath16 ) is now applied in parallel to the magnetic field , it can cause charge transfer from left to right weyl nodes , causing _ violation of separate conservation laws for left and right chiral fermions _",
    ", captured by the following anomaly equation  @xcite @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the electric charge , @xmath19 is the charge ( for @xmath20 ) and current ( for @xmath21 ) operator for left / right chiral fermion , and @xmath22 can be identified as the total degeneracy of effective one - dimensional system . the total charge and current density",
    "is respectively given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a two component spinor , describing the emergent one - dimensional world .",
    "due to the reduced dimensionality of the system , one can define @xmath26 , and accordingly we can define axial or chiral charge and current density as @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "hence , one can express eq .",
    "( [ anomaly-1d ] ) as @xmath29 . in the language of quantum field theory , such violation of separate conservation laws for left and right fermions",
    "is known as _ chiral anomaly _ , specific to odd spatial dimensions . in regular wsm",
    ", the degeneracy of the zll plays the role of @xmath22 , whereas in wsms with @xmath30 , @xmath31 ll degeneracy .",
    "therefore , upon identifying @xmath22 as the _ total _ degeneracy of the generalized wsm zll , we arrive at the quantum field theoretic _ adler - jackiw - bell _ anomaly equation  @xcite @xmath32 now generalized for the generalized weyl system , constituted by weyl nodes with an arbitrary monopole charge @xmath0 .",
    "notice that here electric ( @xmath33 ) and magnetic ( @xmath34 ) fields are strictly _ static abelian background fields_. we also stress that in the above expression @xmath35 can _ never _ be negative as the @xmath3-linear dependence arises from the ll dos , and insensitive to the direction of applied electric and magnetic field .",
    "such a tantalizing quantum field theoretic chiral anomaly analogy has led to considerable theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite activities aimed at demonstrating the manifestation of chiral anomaly through lmt .",
    "it is , however , unclear that these chiral anomaly considerations apply directly in solid state materials since the nonconservation chiral current in the quantum field theoretic adler - jackiw - bell anomaly crucially depends on the existence of an _ unbounded _ linear dispersion of weyl fermions  @xcite , whereas the energy dispersion in all condensed matter systems is unavoidably bounded by the natural lattice cut off .",
    "however in a pioneer work nielsen and ninomiya showed that certain gapless semiconductors accommodating linear touching of valence and conduction bands can give rise to lmt arising essentially from the chiral anomaly physics of current nonconservation  @xcite . in this regard , we must recall that almost thirty years before the proposal of nielsen and ninomiya , adam and argyres demonstrated the existence of lmt for conventional three - dimensional fermi liquids , i.e. , ordinary metals and doped semiconductors , without invoking the notion of chiral or axial anomaly  @xcite .",
    "their derivation of lmt solely relies on few generic features of a three - dimensional electronic system in a strong magnetic field : the existence of ( i ) one - dimensional dispersive lls since momentum along the applied magnetic field is a conserved quantity , and ( ii ) at least one partially filled ll that cuts fermi energy at two isolated points ( or in general even number of points in the brillouin zone ) . therefore , the existence of lmt in the absence of the classical lorentz force ( when @xmath33 and @xmath34 are parallel ) although necessarily points toward subtle quantum mechanical effects , yet its direct connection with chiral anomaly is not obvious .",
    "specifically , the chiral anomaly implies an lmt through the nielsen - ninomiya mechanism , but the reverse is not true , i.e. , the existence of an lmt does not necessarily imply a chiral anomaly ",
    "lmt is necessary , but by no means sufficient , for the universal existence of the chiral anomaly .",
    "recently goswami _ et .",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated the generic existence of lmt for  _ a generic three dimensional metal _ \" .",
    "specifically , the chiral anomaly implies an lmt through the _ nielsen - ninomiya mechanism _ , but the reverse remains to be established .",
    "we here follow the philosophy of ref .",
    "@xcite and show that any wsm with arbitrary monopole charge display lmt when placed in a strong magnetic field without invoking the physics of chiral anomaly . for the sake of technical simplicity",
    "we assume that only the manifold of zlls is partially filled .",
    "however , our analysis can be generalized to demonstrate generic lmt in weyl materials even when multiple lls are partially filled , i.e. , the system is in the strong field limit ( see sec .",
    "[ generalanomaly ] ) .",

    ", @xmath41 parametrizes the tilting of magnetic field away from the @xmath37 direction .",
    "weyl nodes are separated along the @xmath37 direction . ,",
    "width=188,height=188 ]    in this context few comments are due . in the presence of the periodic potential in a solid , arising from the ionic lattice ,",
    "quasiparticles perform bloch oscillations and consequently the system can not sustain any finite steady state current  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the presence of a momentum relaxation mechanism , which is naturally offered by impurity scattering , quasiparticles lose the freedom to perform a complete bloch oscillation and a metallic system can support finite steady state current , when the relaxation or transport lifetime ( @xmath42 ) is much shorter than the bloch oscillation period . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the low temperature situation where impurity scattering is the primary scattering mechanism for transport as phonons are mostly frozen out .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of strong magnetic fields , i.e. when @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the cyclotron frequency , the path of the carriers is so curved that the period of completing a cyclotron orbit becomes comparable to that between two successive collisions .",
    "therefore , the transport / relaxation time acquires a strong field dependence and @xmath45 . in this strong - field limit , one can not assume the relaxation time to be field - independent which is the standard approximation in metallic transport since in metals one is often in the weak - field semiclassical limit where @xmath46 .",
    "such a field dependence of @xmath42 is extracted here by using _ quantum boltzmann equation _ , but omitted in the semiclassical theory ( where the transport relaxation time is taken to be field - independent ) , which therefore is only applicable for extremely weak magnetic fields ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "but , for sufficiently weak magnetic fields one needs to account for yet another pure quantum mechanical effect , the _ weak localization _  @xcite , which arises from quantum interference of electron paths  our theory neglects the weak localization physics since the strong magnetic field completely breaks the time reversal invariance .",
    "presently it is unknown how to incorporate all these effects in a unified theoretical framework , and restricting ourselves to the strong field quantum limit @xmath43 we establish the following theoretically :    1 .   in the presence of both gaussian and coulomb impurities ,",
    "we extract the magnetic field dependence of transport lifetime using quantum boltzmann equation , and show that all wsms manifest _ positive _ longitudinal magnetoconductivity ( lmc ) or negative longitudinal magnetoresistivity ( lmr ) , when the magnetic and electric fields are applied parallel to each other ( see fig .  [ geometry ] ) .",
    "2 .   due to the carrier - induced screening of coulomb potential ( arising from finite dos of lls )",
    ", we mainly focus on gaussian impurities and show that when the fields are applied along a high symmetry axis separating the weyl nodes , the lmc increases linearly with @xmath3 in all wsms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : conductivity - singleweyl ] ) .",
    "the lmc in the presence of only coulomb impurities grows as @xmath48 , but only in extreme strong field limit ( we believe that the same result applies to screened coulomb impurity potential also since screening renders the coulomb potential into a short - range scattering potential similar to the gaussian case ) .",
    "although such a linear increase of lmc is insensitive to the field orientation in single wsms , lmc develops _ nonlinear _ dependencies on the magnetic field in double and triple wsm when the field is tilted away from the high symmetry axis ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : conductivity-1 ] and  [ fig : conductivity-2 ] ) , which can be tested in proposed double wsms hgcr@xmath8se@xmath9 and srsi@xmath8 .",
    "thus , the quantitative field dependence of lmc depends on the wsm monopole charge whereas the qualitative existence of the negative lmr itself ( positive lmc ) is generic in all wsms in the strong - field regime .",
    "we find that typically the relaxation lifetime due to gaussian impurities @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the same quantity but due to ionic impurities .",
    "hence , the transport lifetime is dominated by gaussian impurities and in our analysis we mainly focus on short range elastic scatterer .",
    "in addition , we also investigate the role of electronic interaction on lmt as the temperature ( magnetic field ) is gradually decreased ( increased ) .",
    "the dos in a pristine wsm scales as @xmath51 and the weyl nodes are extremely robust against weak short - range electron - electron interaction .",
    "however , due to landau quantization , the dos for the emergent one - dimensional system is _ constant _ , which in turn can trigger various density - wave instabilities even when the electronic interaction is sufficiently weak .",
    "the quintessential effects of interactions can be summarized as the following .    1 .   depending on the microscopic details",
    ", zlls can undergo a weak coupling ( bcs - like ) instability in the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) or spin - density - wave ( sdw ) channel as common in one - dimensional electron systems .",
    "irrespective of the actual nature of the ordering the density - wave orders break the translational symmetry and gap out the zlls .",
    "when the field is applied along the high symmetry axis all @xmath0 number of zlls are expected to suffer density - wave ordering _",
    "simultaneously_. thus , below the transition temperature ( @xmath52 ) lmc ( lmr ) becomes _ negative ( positive ) _ , reversing the trend compared with the normal phase with no density wave ordering .",
    "however , upon tilting the field away from the high symmetry axis , the exact @xmath0 fold degeneracy of zlls is lifted , and the system can undergo a _ cascade _ of density - wave transitions with distinct transition temperatures . hence , lmc / lmr in a multi - wsm is expected to display @xmath0 fold discontinuity before it becomes negative / positive .",
    "although such ordering in a clean system ( devoid of any impurity ) should take place for arbitrarily weak interaction , disorder naturally reduces the propensity towards such translational symmetry breaking ordering  @xcite ( we mention that there is no anderson theorem here protecting the symmetry - broken phase against impurity scattering ) . thus clear signatures of cdw or sdw ordering can only be observed in clean systems at sufficiently low temperature and for strong enough magnetic fields .",

    "then it is natural to assume that electronic interaction is stronger for density - wave ordering with smaller wave vectors since @xmath271 increases for smaller @xmath272 .",
    "therefore , in double wsms , as the temperature ( magnetic field ) is gradually lowered ( increased ) the fermi points marked by",
    " r \" get gapped out first , followed by the ones marked by ",
    "l \" [ see fig .",
    "[ ll_dw_general ] ] .",
    "the periodicity of density - wave ordering in the  r \" and  l \" channels is respectively @xmath273/a$ ] where @xmath274 depends on the orientation of the magnetic field .",
    "similarly , in triple wsm , the mass generation first takes place among the  r \" points , followed by the  c \" points and finally the  l \" points , see fig .",
    "[ ll_tw_general ] .",
    "the periodicity of density - wave ordering in these three channels are @xmath275/a$ ] , for @xmath142 respectively for  r \" ,  c \" and  l \" channels .",
    "thus as the temperature is gradually lowered in double and triple wsms ( with field tilted away from the @xmath37 direction ) , they undergo a cascade of transitions into density - wave phases with different periodicity , and below each such transition temperature the lmc displays _ discontinuity _ and its rate of growth decreases , before it becomes negative when all zlls are gapped out , as shown in fig .",
    "[ lmt - density - wave ] ( b ) and ( c ) . in other words , in single wsm the lmr becomes positive once the density - wave ordering sets in , while in double ( triple ) weyl semimetal lmr should display a two ( three ) stage transition toward a positive value .",
    "the separation among the transition temperature or onset magnetic field ( @xmath276 ) among various density - wave transitions ( hence the distance among various discontinuities in lmc / lmr ) gets bigger as the magnetic field is gradually tilted away from the @xmath37 direction , since the emergent one - dimensional fermi points gets further separated with increasing tilting of the magnetic field away from the axis separating two weyl nodes [ see figs .",
    "[ ll_dw_general ] ,  [ ll_tw_general ] ] .",
    "such steps in lmr can possibly be detected in experiments and may serve as an indication for density - wave ordering in the system . as a final remark , we would like to point out that recent magnetotransport measurements in graphite ( for band structure see refs .",
    "@xcite ) is strongly suggestive of a density - wave ordering in strong magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "[ summary ]    to summarize , we here address several important aspects of weyl semimetals when these systems are placed in a strong magnetic field . in the absence of magnetic fields , three - dimensional weyl semimetals are constituted by weyl nodes that can be classified according to the monopole charge @xmath6 , @xmath277 and @xmath2 . the integer monopole charge ( @xmath0 )",
    "determines the topological invariant of a weyl semimetal , and the surface fermi arc in such systems possesses an additional @xmath0-fold _ orbital _ degeneracy .",
    "when placed in a magnetic field , the underlying topological invariant manifests itself through the number of chiral zeroth landau levels . thus double and triple weyl semimetals respectively support two and three copies of the zeroth landau level while a regular or single weyl semimetal is devoid of any flavor degeneracy when the magnetic field is applied in the @xmath37 direction , along which the weyl nodes are separated in the momentum space .",
    "the same conclusion also follows from a calculation based on a lattice model , as shown in appendix  [ landaulevel_append ] . within the framework of the continuum description of these system",
    ", we always find @xmath0 zeroth landau levels , irrespective of the direction of the applied magnetic field , although their exact degeneracy breaks down when the field is tilted away from the @xmath37 direction .",
    "also the density of states in the presence of landau levels displays a strong angular dependence , which can be observed in angle resolved quantum oscillation experiments .",
    "we also show that the formation of landau levels in weyl materials can generically lead to longitudinal magnetotransport , since they are dispersive in the direction of the applied magnetic field . to obtain a steady state magnetoconductivity",
    "we invoke the relaxation mechanism arising from the backscattering by impurities and take into account two sources of elastic scattering ( a ) gaussian impurity and ( b ) coulomb impurity .",
    "however , due to finite density of states , the scattering potential in the effective one - dimensional world is always short ranged , and we mainly focus on the former source of elastic scattering since the coulomb disorder is strongly screened by the carriers . assuming that ( i ) the system is in the quantum limit ( @xmath278 ) , and ( ii ) only the subspace of zeroth landau level is partially filled , we calculate the magnetic field dependence of transport lifetime in the presence of strong backscattering using the quantum boltzmann equation and show that the longitudinal magnetoconductivity increases linearly with the applied magnetic field , when the field is applied along the separation of weyl nodes in the pristine system . within the low - energy approximation , we find that such linear-@xmath3 dependence of the longitudinal magnetoconductance in double and triple weyl semimetals smoothly crosses over to a nonlinear @xmath3 dependence when the field is tilted away from the @xmath37 direction , which can be tested experimentally .",
    "the longitudinal magnetoconductivity in all weyl semimetals scales as @xmath48 when the magnetic field is applied along the separation of two pristine weyl nodes , in the presence of coulomb / ionic impurities , but in the extremely strong field limit .",
    "in order to verify our predictions of lmc in systems dominant by gaussian ( short - ranged ) and coulomb ( long - ranged ) impurities , as well as the crossover between them , one can systematically introduce short - ranged or long - ranged impurities in a given sample , and vary their concentrations in a controlled way . for example , long - range disordered potentials can be generated by dopant charged impurities , while short - range disordered potentials can be introduced by radiation damage .",
    "such an experimental technique provided the key evidence in finding out the relative importance of long - range versus short - range disorder potentials in the transport properties of graphene  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a similar technique could in principle be used in wsms to test our predictions with respect to longitudinal magnetotransport .",
    "finally , we also address the effects of electron - electron interaction on longitudinal magnetotransport in weyl semimetals . due to the finite density of states of effective one - dimensional system , weyl fermions are susceptible to various types of translational symmetry breaking density - wave ordering ( charge or spin depending on microscopic details ) even for infinitesimal strength of interaction in the presence of strong external magnetic fields . since a single weyl semimetal hosts one zeroth landau level , the onset of a density wave order immediately gives rise to positive longitudinal magnetoresistance .",
    "such upturn in lmr can be observed below the transition temperature for sufficiently strong magnetic fields .",
    "a similar situation arises in double and triple weyl semimetals when the field is applied along the @xmath37 direction , since all zeroth landau levels are exactly degenerate .",
    "however , the situation changes dramatically as the applied field is gradually tilted away from the @xmath37 direction . since , the two / three zeroth landau levels in double / triple weyl semimetals are no longer degenerate , they respectively undergo two and three transitions into density - wave phases , characterized by different periodicity as well as transition temperature .",
    "thus , as the temperature is gradually lowered in the presence of a strong magnetic field ( applied at a finite angle with respect to the @xmath37 direction ) , the decrease of the longitudinal magnetoresistance with magnetic field gets slower across each such transition , before it finally becomes positive when all members of the zeroth landau level are gapped out by density - wave orderings . thus future experiments in various members of weyl semimetals , when placed in a magnetic field , can display intriguing confluence of landau quantization , longitudinal magnetotransport ( possibly manifesting one - dimensional chiral or axial anomaly ) , and interaction driven charge / spin - density - wave ordering .",

    "[ landaulevel_append ]    in this appendix we show the derivation of ll spectrum for single , double and triple wsm from a lattice model ( bounded dispersion ) , when the magnetic field is applied along the separation of weyl nodes , i.e. along the @xmath37 direction .",

    "if the applied magnetic field is along the @xmath37 direction , the landau level spectrum of this model can be expressed in a closed form .",
    "for example , for a single wsm @xmath280 we have for @xmath281 @xmath282 ^ 2+\\dfrac{2\\alpha_1 ^ 2\\hbar^2}{\\ell_b^2}n},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath283 , and @xmath22 is the landau level index .",
    "the energy dispersion for double @xmath284 and triple @xmath285 wsm can be similarly obtained as follows , @xmath286 ^ 2 + \\dfrac{4\\hbar^4\\alpha_2 ^ 2}{\\ell^4 } n(n-1)\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2 } } , \\notag\\\\          & = \\pm \\left[\\left[\\epsilon_z+\\dfrac{\\hbar^2}{2m\\ell_b^2}(2n+1)\\right]^2 + \\dfrac{8 \\hbar^6\\alpha_3 ^ 2}{\\ell^6 } n(n-1)(n-2)\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}},\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is valid for @xmath287 and @xmath288 , respectively .",

    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : lmc_coulomb ] for various field orientations .",

    "<S> we theoretically address the effects of strong magnetic fields in three - dimensional weyl semimetals ( wsms ) built out of weyl nodes with a monopole charge @xmath0 . for @xmath1 and @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> we realize single , double , and triple wsm , respectively and the monopole charge @xmath0 determines the integer topological invariant of the weyl systems . within the linearized continuum description , the quasiparticle spectrum </S>",
    "<S> is then composed of landau levels ( lls ) , containing exactly @xmath0 number of chiral zeroth landau levels ( zlls ) , irrespective of the orientation of the magnetic field . in the presence of strong backscattering ( due to impurities ) </S>",
    "<S> , these systems generically give rise to longitudinal magnetotransport . restricting ourselves to the quantum limit ( and assuming only the subspace of the zlls is partially filled ) and mainly accounting for gaussian impurities , we show that the longitudinal magnetoconductivity ( lmc ) in all members of the weyl family displays a positive linear-@xmath3 scaling , when the field is applied along the axis that separates the weyl nodes . </S>",
    "<S> but , in double and triple wsm , lmc displays a smooth crossover to a nonlinear @xmath3-dependence as the field is tilted away from such a high symmetry direction . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , due to the enhanced density of states , the ll quantization can trigger instabilities toward the formation of translational symmetry breaking density - wave orderings for sufficiently weak interaction ( bcs instability ) , which gaps out the zlls . </S>",
    "<S> concomitantly as the temperature ( magnetic field ) is gradually decreased ( increased ) the lmc becomes negative . </S>",
    "<S> thus wsms with arbitrary monopole charge ( @xmath0 ) can host an intriguing interplay of ll quantization , longitudinal magnetotransport ( a possible manifestation of one - dimensional chiral or axial anomaly ) , and density - wave ordering , when placed in a strong magnetic field . </S>"
