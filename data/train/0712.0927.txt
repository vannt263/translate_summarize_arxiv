    "the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) are the most luminous and most massive galaxies in the universe .",
    "bcgs are located close to the centre of the clusters of galaxies based on the x - ray observations or gravitational lensing observations ( e.g. , jones & forman 1984 ; smith et al .",
    "it was noted very early on that some bcgs show an excess of light ( ` envelopes ' ) over the de vaucouleurs ( @xmath7 ) profile at large radii ( matthews et al .",
    "1964 ; oemler 1973 , 1976 ; schombert 1986 , 1987 , 1988 ; graham et al .",
    "1996 ) , and a large fraction of bcgs are termed as cd galaxies ( e.g. , patel et al .",
    "although the origin of such extended envelopes is still not completely clear ( e.g. , patel et al . 2006 ) , the extended stellar halos of bcgs to surface brightness @xmath8 are likely from bcgs themselves : the intra - cluster light has much lower surface brightness and only dominates at large radius ( @xmath9 ; for detailed discussions , see zibetti et al .",
    "2005 ; bernardi et al . 2007 ;",
    "lauer et al . 2007 ) .",
    "there has been debate on the formation mechanisms for bcgs and cd galaxies .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed , such as galactic cannibalism ( the merging or capture of cluster satellites due to dynamical friction , ostriker & tremaine 1975 ; white 1976 ; ostriker & hausman 1977 ) , tidal stripping from cluster galaxies ( gallagher & ostriker 1972 ; richstone 1975 , 1976 ; merritt 1985 ) , and star formation on bcgs by cooling flows ( e.g. , fabian 1994 ) .",
    "therefore , it is important to study the photometric properties of bcgs using large and homogeneous bcg samples , which has now become available due to large surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; for earlier studies , e.g. postman & lauer 1995 , see references below ) .",
    "moreover , the statistical properties of the extended envelopes of bcgs may also help to understand how the bcgs form and evolve , especially when combined with high - redshift cluster samples such as ediscs ( white et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "recently , there has been much progress in this area from both observational and theoretical fronts .",
    "observations show that bcgs have distinct properties from the bulk of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the size - luminosity relation and faber - jackson relation ( @xmath10 relation ) for bcgs are significantly steeper than those of non - bcg elliptical galaxies ( lauer et al . 2007 ;",
    "bernardi et al .",
    "2007 ; desroches et al . 2007 ; von der linden et al . 2007 ) .",
    "it implies that bcgs are larger and have lower velocity dispersions than non - bcg elliptical galaxies , which confirms the pioneering work based on a small bcg sample by oegerle & hoessel ( 1991 ) .",
    "the differences between bcgs and non - bcg elliptical galaxies demonstrate that the bcgs may form in a qualitatively different way from non - bcg elliptical galaxies ( de lucia & blaizot 2007 ) .",
    "furthermore , the steeper @xmath10 relation for bcgs than those of non - bcg elliptical galaxies leads to a contradiction in the prediction of black hole ( bh ) masses using the @xmath11 or @xmath12 relationships .",
    "the usual @xmath11 relation can not predict black hole masses larger than @xmath13 @xmath14 in the universe , which is inconsistent with values estimated by other means ( lauer et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "recent simulations and semi - analytic works in the cold dark matter hierarchical structure formation framework provide a plausible picture for the formation of bcgs : they tend to form at high - density peaks when their inhabited dark matter halos collapse at high redshift , and then x - ray driven cooling flows allow a rapid collapse and the formation of a stellar component ( cowie & binney 1977 ; fabian & nulsen 1977 ; fabian 1994 ) .",
    "while more than half of the stellar mass in the bcgs may have formed before redshift three , bcgs still grow substantially through dry ( dissipationless ) mergers when their host massive halos accrete and merge with other halos since redshift one ( gao et al . 2004 ; de lucia & blaizot 2007 ) .",
    "this picture is largely consistent with observations , which does not require cooling flows to provide the cold gas if bcgs form late ; it also overcomes a potential problem that the merger rate in clusters may be too low due to the high velocity dispersion in dynamically relaxed clusters .",
    "furthermore , dry mergers have been directly observed in cluster environments as well as in the field ( e.g. , lauer 1988 ; van dokkum 2005 ; tran et al .",
    "2005 ; bell et al .",
    "2006 ) . however , there are still no systematic investigations on the formation of cd - like bcgs galaxies , especially how the extended stellar halos of cd galaxies form : whether they appear during the dry merger phase , and whether they are the primary cause of the distinct properties of bcgs",
    ". there is also no agreement about the contributions of the intra - cluster light ( e.g. , gonzalez et al . 2005 ; zebetti et al . 2005 ; lauer et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the c4 cluster catalogue ( miller et al . 2005 ) with 748 cluster of galaxies was constructed from the spectroscopic data of second data release ( dr2 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "this is one of the largest published homogeneous database of nearby clusters and groups ( @xmath15 ) . in principle , it is suitable for statistical studies of bcgs ( see also the more recent , much larger maxbcg catalogue of 13,823 clusters of koester et al .",
    "2007 ) . based on bcgs from this",
    "published cluster catalogue , or the un - published c4 cluster catalogue selected from sdss dr3 , bernardi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and von der linden et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find that bcgs have different properties , in particular their scaling laws , from non - bcg early type galaxies .",
    "their results are , however , not entirely consistent with each other , which could be due to different sample selections or photometry methods .",
    "in fact , the slope indices in the size - luminosity and faber - jackson ( @xmath10 ) relations found by bernardi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) are also significantly different from those of lauer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , although the trends are the same and these two groups use similar methods to measure luminosities and effective radius @xmath16 ; both are based on fitting the @xmath7 law to the @xmath17band surface brightness profiles within 50  or to some surface brightness limit of the bcgs . however , the samples they used are different .",
    "lauer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) use their own all sky , volume limited ( z@xmath180.05 ) survey of 119 bcgs with precise ground - based surface photometry ( postman & lauer 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , it is worth investigating whether sample selections and photometry can lead to inconsistencies on scaling laws . in this paper , we construct a different , nearby ( with redshift @xmath19 ) bcg sample based on the c4 cluster catalogue , and perform our own photometry .",
    "in particular , we examine how the scaling relations change when different isophotal limits are applied , and compare the results with those of bernardi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , lauer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and von der linden et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  2 and  3",
    "we describe the selection of our local bcg sample and photometric data reduction .",
    "we present our main results in  4 and finish with a discussion & summary in  5 . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a cosmology with a matter density parameter @xmath20 , a cosmological constant @xmath21 and a hubble constant of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "our early type bcg sample is drawn from the early version of the c4 cluster catalogue ( miller et al .",
    "2005 ) . given that bcgs are located near the centre of clusters of galaxies which is often crowded with galaxies and contaminated by intra - cluster light , to ensure the reliable photometric measurement with high enough s@xmath24n ratio for each sample bcg to @xmath25@xmath26 mag / arcsec@xmath27 that is significantly higher than the intra - cluster light ( zibetti et al .",
    "2005 ; lauer et al . 2007 ; bernardi et al .",
    "2007 ) , we restrict our bcg sample to be brighter than 14.5 mag in the sdss @xmath1-band model magnitude . after we exclude 10 duplicated objects ( bernardi et al .",
    "2007 ) , there are 114 galaxies selected out of a total of 748 bcgs in the c4 cluster catalogue .",
    "due to fiber collisions in the spectroscopic data , it is necessary to incorporate the sdss photometric catalogue to avoid missing bcgs using the c4 algorithm . the dr2 version of the c4 catalogue tried to correct for this by selecting the brightest cluster galaxy based on the photometric catalog .",
    "however , as several works ( e.g. , bernardi et al .",
    "2007 ; von der linden et al . 2007 ) noticed , some stars or spiral galaxies ( some of these are located at the edge of clusters ) have been mis - classified as bcgs .",
    "we thus performed visual inspections of two - colour images in the @xmath28-band and @xmath1-band for all the 114 bcg candidates and their clusters in a region of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "we found that c4 1024 , c4 2092 , c4 2097 , c4 2031 , c4 2109 , c4 3021 and c4 3268 are seriously contaminated by adjacent bright stars or foreground galaxies ; c4 3047 is located at the edge of the corrected frame ( stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) ; c4 3235 is a star ; c4 2178 and c4 3257 are nearly edge - on galaxies with dust lanes . in addition",
    ", there are 5 objects ( c4 1265 , c4 1332 , c4 2130 , c4 3098 , and c4 3205 ) whose parent cluster richness , defined as the number of galaxies within 1 @xmath31 , is less than 10 , and hence they may be wrong identifications . in the remaining 98 objects , there are 10 bcgs that are late type galaxies with obvious spiral arms ( c4 1023 , c4 1053 , c4 1324 , c4 1366 , c4 2001 , c4 3016 , c4 3143 , c4 3246 , c4 3282 , and c4 3286 ) .",
    "these are also excluded from our early type bcg sample , leaving us with 88 possible early - type bcgs .",
    "we further excluded 3 objects ( c4 1048 , c4 1186 and c4 3285 ) with @xmath32 that are fainter than @xmath33 galaxies ( @xmath34 for @xmath35 , see blanton et al .",
    "2003a ) and they are unlikely bcgs ( bernardi et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the detailed information for all 29 rejected objects are listed in table 1 .",
    "our final sample consists of 85 bcgs that are in the redshift mange of 0.03@xmath36z@xmath360.09 and @xmath37band ( model ) apparent magnitude in @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , we carefully searched for the second ranked cluster galaxies in the 85 c4 clusters and found that the bcgs are about 1.6 mag brighter on average than the second ranked cluster galaxies for the @xmath37band absolute magnitude at @xmath39 .",
    "only 6 bcgs have absolute magnitudes within 0.5 mag of the second ranked cluster galaxies . during this process",
    ", we found one mis - identified bcg for c4 2020 ( abell 0119 ) , the brightest galaxy in this cluster is ugc 00579 , instead of ark 021 as listed in the c4 catalog .",
    "we caution that such cases may also exist in the unpublished c4 catalogue based on the dr3 of the sdss ( see von der linden et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "notice that there are 4 bcgs ( c4 2049 , c4 1176 , c4 3311 and c4 1035 ) in our bcg sample described above with obvious merger features .",
    "c4 2049 , 1176 and 1035 are merger galaxies with two close nuclei and c4 3311 is with clear asymmetrical shapes .",
    "we will discuss these four objects in more detail in ",
    "[ sec : merger ] .    in order to perform direct comparisons with non - bcgs , we construct a control sample of normal early - type galaxies from the sdss dr2 spectroscopic catalogue with galaxy velocity dispersion measurement in the mpa gal@xmath40info catalogue.data.html ] these control galaxies are chosen to be in the same redshift and apparent magnitude ranges as sample bcgs , i.e. , 0.03@xmath36z@xmath360.09 and 13.5@xmath36mag@xmath3614.5 .",
    "244 early - type galaxies are selected as the control sample after excluding nearly edge - on objects ( most of them have dust features ) , contaminated sources , and objects identified as c4 bcgs . the distributions of the corrected redshifts relative to the local group ( see blanton et al .",

    "[ redz_col.eps ] .",
    "it can be seen that the control sample has a lower redshift range than those of bcgs .",
    "this is because non - bcgs are intrinsically fainter than the bcgs24 in the @xmath1-band are bcgs .",
    "lin @xmath42 mohr ( 2004 ) found that bcgs are about one magnitude ( 0.83 ) brighter on average than the second ranked cluster galaxies even within a small metric radius of @xmath43 kpc .",
    "this does not contradict with the larger difference ( 1.6 mag on average ) we found for our bcg sample because we measure the magnitudes to @xmath39 , which corresponds to a larger physical size than the radius used by them . ]",
    "( see the bottom panel ) , so for the same magnitude limit , they reside more locally .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to construct a control sample in the same luminosity range as that of bcgs .",
    "instead we attempt a comparison in a narrow luminosity range , @xmath44 ( indicated by two vertical dashed lines at the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ redz_col.eps ] ) where there are sufficient overlaps between the control sample and bcgs ( see  [ sec : scaling ] for comparisons ) .",
    "furthermore , both samples have colour @xmath45 , implying that all of them are early type galaxies colour - wise ( see blanton et al .",
    "2003b ; shen et al .",
    "2003 and reference therein ) .",
    "also the concentration index @xmath46 for virtually all our galaxies is larger than 2.6 , again consistent with their being early - type galaxies ( shimasaku et al . 2001 ; strateva et al . 2001 ) .",

    "given that the sdss image survey in the @xmath47 and @xmath48bands are relatively shallow and the @xmath49band images suffer from the ` red halo ' effect ( e.g. , michard 2002 ; wu et al .",

    "the corrected frames have already been processed by the sdss photometric pipeline ( photo ) , including bias - subtraction , flat - fielding , cosmic ray removal and corrections for pixel defects .",

    "( 2005 ) before constructing the sky background model below .    as lauer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) pointed out that the sdss photometric reduction systematically under - estimates the luminosities and half - light radius of bcgs .",

    "both problems are present for bcgs . as a result ,",
    "bernardi et al . (",
    "2007 ) performed their own photometric reductions for their sample . on the other hand , von der linden et al .",
    "( 2007 ) address this problem by adding up to 70% of the difference between the local ( 256 @xmath52 256 pixels ) and the global ( 2048 @xmath52 1498 pixels ) sky background ( both are available from photo ) around the bcgs to the radial surface brightness profiles and the photometry .",
    "however , the sky background in the sdss frames often shows spatial gradients and asymmetry ( see the third row of fig .",
    "[ sky_estimate.eps ] for an example ) .",
    "therefore , adding a constant background value to the radial surface brightness profiles may not yield the most accurate photometry , at least on one - to - one basis ( see fig .",

    "( 1999 ) and wu et al . ( 2002 ) , which was developed to perform deep photometry for nearby large spiral galaxies .",
    "this method has been applied to ngc 5907 and ngc 4565 , which achieved accurate photometry down to an isophotal limit of @xmath53 in the intermediate bands of the batc system ( fan et al .",
    "1996 ) .    to obtain accurate information of the sky background ,",
    "we first generate a 2048 @xmath52 1498 pixels ( @xmath54 ) background - only image using sextractor ( bertin @xmath42 amounts 1996 ) by masking all the detected objects with counts above 1@xmath55 noise ( of the whole frame ) in a frame smoothed by a circular gaussian with a standard deviation @xmath55 = 3 pixels .",
    "as most of sample bcgs have sizes of a few square arcminutes , there are sufficient regions in the masked image to determine the sky background . a median filter with @xmath56 pixels is then convolved with the unmasked pixels , after which second - order legendre polynomials are used to fit both rows and columns respectively ( see zheng et al . 1999 and wu et al .",
    "the fitted legendre polynomials are then further smoothed using a circular gaussian filter with @xmath55 = 9 pixels to obtain our final sky background model . for most bcgs , we find that the sky background is tilted with a spatial variation about 1 @xmath57 2 adu across the whole frame .",
    "we can subtract this model from the frame to obtain the sky - free image .",
    "our sky subtraction procedure is similar to that in gonzalez et al .",
    "furthermore , the sky background subtracted not only includes the contributions of the intra - cluster light ( which is at a much lower level ) , but also from other astrophysical sources ( dust emission etc .",
    ", see gonzalez et al . 2005 for a discussion ) .",
    "our procedure is illustrated in fig .",

    "the first , second and third rows of fig .",
    "[ sky_estimate.eps ] show the frame , the masked frame and the smoothed sky background in the @xmath37band .",
    "notice that the sky background shows a gradient across the frame .",
    "the bottom panels show the distributions of counts in the sky - subtracted frame for all unmasked pixels and for the local vicinity around the target bcg .",
    "if the sky background model is successful , then we expect the background counts to follow a gaussian distribution with a mean close to zero .",
    "this is indeed the case , as can be seen from the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ sky_estimate.eps ] .",
    "the distributions in the @xmath37band for the whole image and the local region are well - fit by gaussians with dispersion of 5.52adu and a mean value of about @xmath58 adu .",
    "after background subtraction , we geometrically align the two - colour frames , and then trim the corrected frames to 501@xmath52501 pixels centred on the target .",
    "we run sextractor again on the trimmed frame to generate a ` segmentation ' image , which identifies all objects with flags in the frames . a mask image with all the detected objects except the galaxy of interest flagged",
    "can then be obtained from the ` segmentation ' image .",
    "we carefully examined all the mask images in two colours and corrected a few bad images manually to create good mask images for all galaxies .",
    "photometry is then performed on the trimmed images with the masked areas excluded from the reduction ; we discuss the details below .      to compare the scaling relations , such as the size - luminosity relation and faber - jackson relation , of bcgs with those of the bulk of elliptical galaxies , we need to perform accurate surface photometry .",
    "in this work , we measure the isophotal magnitudes within a certain radius , instead of magnitudes based on a model ( e.g. , a de vaucouleurs [ 1948 ] model or a s@xmath59rsic [ 1968 ] model ) as a large fraction of bcgs is not well described by such simple models . furthermore , to see how the scaling relations vary as a function of isophotal limits , we measure the photometric parameters to four different surface brightness limits , 22 , 23 , 24 , and 25 mag / arcsec@xmath27 .",

    "we briefly outline the procedures below ; the readers are referred to that paper for more details .",
    "the isophote / ellipse task in iraf is used to fit each of the trimmed background - subtracted images with a series of elliptical annuli from the centre to the outskirts .",
    "the width of annuli is chosen to increase uniformly in logarithmic steps , with the semi - major axis radius increasing by 10% between two adjacent annuli .",
    "the size of the annuli in the outer parts is therefore larger , which suppresses the shot noise in the outer regions where the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is lower . the ellipticity , position angle , and other quantities are also fitted simultaneously .",
    "the @xmath37band images are first used to define the isophotal annuli , which are then applied to the @xmath50band images .",
    "the coordinates of the photometric peak in both @xmath37band and @xmath50band are obtained by the daophot package and are fixed during fitting .",
    "we estimate the seeing of our galaxies in two colours by averaging the star profiles in the corresponding frames respectively .",
    "the average values of the fwhms of the seeings in both colours are @xmath60 , which are similar to the measurements by the sdss collaboration .",
    "we integrate the observed surface brightness profiles directly to estimate the isophotal apparent magnitudes and half - light radius @xmath61 , within which half of the integrated flux of galaxies is contained , under each isophotal limit . the absolute magnitude ( @xmath62 )",
    "is derived from the obtained isophotal apparent magnitude ( @xmath63 ) by @xmath64 , taking into account the extinction ( @xmath65 ) in each filter by the sdss , and the k - correction ( using the kcorrect algorithm of blanton & roweis 2007 ) .",
    "other photometric parameters , such as ellipticities , coefficients of lowest order deviations from perfect ellipse @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( see bender et al .",
    "1988 ) , are derived following hao et al .",
    "notice that the @xmath68 parameters are weighted by the intensity between twice the seeing radius and the radius where the surface brightness is @xmath39 in the @xmath37band .",

    "the surface brightness profiles in the two bands are performed accounting for the galactic extinction correction , cosmological dimming , and the k - correction ( blanton & roweis 2007 ) .",
    "the photometric errors are estimated as in wu et al .",

    "[ a4_mag.eps ] that the boxy fractions of bcgs with luminosities in the range of @xmath99 and mag@xmath100 are @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively .",
    "so there are still a large fraction of very luminous early type galaxies with disky isophotes ( @xmath103 ) , which is consistent with the hst image results on bcgs by laine et al .",
    "faber et al .",

    "other works ( e.g. , rest et al . 2001 ) show that bright galaxies are slowly rotating , boxy systems ( davies et al .",
    "1983 ) while faint elliptical galaxies are fast rotating , disky systems ( bender 1988 ; bender et al . 1989 ; nieto et al . 1988 ) . however , bcgs appear to somewhat contradict with this trend : some very luminous bcgs still have disky isophotes .",
    "the flattening in elliptical galaxies can arise either from an - isotropic motions or from rotation .",
    "faint ellipticals appear to be flattened by rotation ( e.g. , van den bosch et al .",

    "as we have shown in the last subsection , bcgs may have experienced fairly recent merging events , and thus may still retain some of the orbital angular momentum from merging , and their isophotes may be disky .",

    "2007 ; desroches et al . 2007 ; von der linden et al . 2007 ; lauer et al . 2007 ) .",

    "in particular , the size - luminosity relations for bcgs is already slightly steeper ( but not very statistically significant ) than those of the bulk of ellipticals when the isophotal limit is @xmath119 , corresponding to a physical half - light radius of about 5kpc ( see fig .",
    "[ para_contrast.eps ] ) .",
    "it indicates that the deviation of size - luminosity relation for bcgs from that of bulk of ellipticals may already occur for the inner regions of ellipticals , and thus is not because most bcgs have extended stellar halos .",
    "rather , this suggests the deviations arise from different dynamical structures of bcgs from the bulk of ellipticals .",
    "bernardi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) arrived at a similar conclusion by comparing the size - luminosity relations for bcgs with and without extended stellar envelopes ( see also von der linden 2007 ) .    the power - law index ( @xmath120 ) for the size - luminosity relation we derived for bcgs at an isophotal limits of @xmath116 mag / arcsec@xmath27 is slightly smaller than the value ( @xmath121 ) obtained by bernardi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , but the power - law index ( @xmath122 ) for the control sample at the same isophotal limit is a bit larger than their value ( @xmath123 ) . the difference in the slope measured by us and by bernardi et al .",

    "in fact , when we use the same method as bernardi et al .",

    "( 2007 ) , indicating that different ways of photometry can give different power - law indices in the size - luminosity relation .",
    "von der linden ( 2007 ) also derived the size - luminosity relation down to 23 @xmath0 for their bcgs .",
    "the slope they derived is @xmath125 , similar to that for their control sample ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "our slope for the bcgs ( @xmath127 ) is steeper than their value at the same isophotal limit , while the slope for our control sample ( @xmath128 ) agrees well with theirs .",
    "we have 66 overlapping galaxies with the bcg samples used by von der linden et al .",
    "if we use only these galaxies , we derive a slope similar to theirs .",
    "our steeper slope appears to arise from the fact that our bcgs are brighter since their sample includes more fainter bcgs which makes their slope shallower ( von der linden 2007 , private communication ) .",
    "therefore , the sample construction also influences the power - law index in the size - luminosity relation .    the power - law index @xmath129 in the size - luminosity relation by lauer et al .",

    "these results are in good agreement with bernardi et al .",

    "1999 ; wu et al .",
    "2002 , see  [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "it came as somewhat a surprise to us that the simple recipe of von der linden et al .",
    "( 2007 ) gives surface brightness profiles similar to ours , and hence for many statistical purposes their simple recipe can be adopted as a more efficient alternative .",
    "we analysed the surface brightness properties of our bcgs using the @xmath73 profiles ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : eta ] ) .",
    "we demonstrate that its gradient , @xmath148 , can be used as an indicator of extended envelopes of cd galaxies ( patel et al .",
    "furthermore , we find that the depth of valley , @xmath85 in the @xmath82 profiles can be used to quantitatively measure the properties of the plateaus in the surface brightness profiles . generally , the deeper the valleys are ( corresponding to a larger value of @xmath85 ) , the flatter and wider the plateaus are in the @xmath73 profiles .",
    "however , the @xmath85 parameter appears to vary in a continuous way with the galaxy parameters , such as their size and luminosity . while there is a clear trend that more luminous and larger bcgs have larger stellar halos .",
    "the continuous variation makes it difficult to un - ambiguously classify cd or non - cd galaxies based on the surface brightness profiles alone .",
    "we measured the photometric properties of galaxies to four different isophotal limits , @xmath149 , and @xmath39 , and used these to investigate the scaling laws and their dependence on these limits .",
    "the latter is of particular relevance as some previous investigations derived scaling relations for bcgs using different samples and different isophotal limits ( e.g. , the study of von der linden et al .",
    "2007 used an isophotal limit of 23@xmath0 ) .",
    "we find that the size - luminosity relation and fabor - jackson ( @xmath10 ) relations of bcgs are consistent with being steeper than those of the bulk of early type galaxies for a control sample selected within the same absolute magnitude range ( @xmath150 ) , although the latter is not statistically significant due to the limited sample sizes .",
    "furthermore , as the photometric limit becomes deeper , the size - luminosity relation for bcgs and the bulk of the ellipticals becomes steeper . however , there are already ( small ) differences between bcgs and regular ellipticals at @xmath151 , a surface brightness that probes the inner parts of galaxies .",
    "this , together with the relatively small difference in the scaling relations between @xmath152 and @xmath39 , suggests that there may be intrinsic differences in the dynamic structures between bcgs and the bulk of early type galaxies ( bernardi et al .",
    "2007 ; lauer et al . 2007 ) .",
    "one possibility may be that the amount of dark matter in the central parts of bcgs and regular ellipticals is different ( von der linden et al .",
    "2007 ) , or perhaps the relative importance of an - isotropy and rotation may be different . in this context , it is interesting to note that we find a large fraction of very luminous early type galaxies with disky isophotes .",
    "this appears to somewhat contradict with the usual expectation that the most luminous galaxies should show boxy isophotes .",
    "also notice that it is difficult to measure high - redshift galaxies to very faint surface brightness due to the cosmological dimming .",
    "thus a proper comparison between local and high - redshift samples will need to explicitly account for the surface brightness dependence we found in the paper .    in this work we uncovered four strong dry merger candidate bcgs ( see fig .",

    "we also found another 10 bcgs in our sample with possible dry merger signatures ( see fig .",
    "[ example_merger.eps ] ) , as advocated by bell et al . ( 2006 ) .",

    "<S> we investigate the photometric properties of the early type brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) using a carefully selected sample of 85 bcgs from the c4 cluster catalogue with redshift less than 0.1 . </S>",
    "<S> we perform accurate background subtractions , and surface photometry for these bcgs to 25 @xmath0 in the sloan @xmath1-band . by quantitatively analysing the gradient of the petrosian profiles of bcgs </S>",
    "<S> , we find that a large fraction of bcgs have extended stellar envelopes in their outskirts ; more luminous bcgs tend to have more extended stellar halos that are likely connected with mergers . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison sample of elliptical galaxies was chosen with similar apparent magnitude and redshift ranges , for which the same photometric analysis procedure is applied . </S>",
    "<S> we find that bcgs have steeper size - luminosity ( @xmath2 ) and faber - jackson ( @xmath3 ) relations than the bulk of early type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the power - law indices ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) in these relations increase as the isophotal limits become deeper . for isophotal limits from 22 to 25 @xmath0 , bcgs are usually larger than the bulk of early type galaxies , and a large fraction ( @xmath6 ) of bcgs have disky isophotal shapes . </S>",
    "<S> the differences in the scaling relations are consistent with a scenario where the dynamical structure and formation route of bcgs may be different from the bulk of early type galaxies , in particular dry ( dissipationless ) mergers may play a more important role in their formation ; we highlight several possible dry merger candidates in our sample .    </S>",
