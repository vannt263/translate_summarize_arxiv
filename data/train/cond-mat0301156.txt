    "in a recent work , kafri et al . @xcite gave a criterion for the existence of phase separation in driven one - dimensional systems .",
    "discussions on this theme have been the subject of a long series of investigations @xcite .",
    "the criterion relies on a mapping , in the stationary state , of the system onto a zero - range process .",
    "for example , consider a two - species model , where each site of a one - dimensional ring is either occupied by a ( @xmath7 ) particle , or by a ( @xmath8 ) particle , or is vacant ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "positive particles are driven to the right , negative particles to the left , and they exchange positions when meeting .",
    "define domains as uninterrupted sequences of ( @xmath10 or ( @xmath11 particles .",
    "then identify the zeros with boxes , the particles with balls , and a domain with the content of the box attached to the zero to its left , say",
    ". then the system of ( @xmath12 particles can be viewed as a system of balls in boxes , where the rate at which a ball leaves a box is given by the current out of a domain .",
    "this process is known as a zero - range process ( zrp ) @xcite , more precisely defined below .",
    "note that such a mapping of the particle system to the corresponding zrp gives a coarse - grained description of the former , because the spatial structure inside domains is lost . once the hopping rate @xmath13 out of a box containing @xmath14 balls is known , the analysis of the stationary state of the zrp is straightforward .",
    "depending on the behaviour of @xmath13 at large @xmath14 , it is easy to show that there is , or there is not , a condensation transition , where a macroscopic fraction of balls is contained in one box , the condensate .",
    "this corresponds in the original particle system to a condensed phase where a single domain contains a macroscopic fraction of the particles .",
    "this is , in essence , the analysis given in  @xcite . examples of particle systems with two species satisfying the criterion for the existence of phase separation have been subsequently given in  @xcite .",
    "these considerations concern the stationary state .",
    "we are thus naturally lead to address the question of the dynamics , both for the underlying original microscopic particle models , and for their coarse - grained counterpart , the zrp .    for the latter ,",
    "the agenda is clear .",
    "the question is to determine the temporal evolution of the system starting from a random initial condition , once given the hopping rate out of a box .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the study of the dynamics of a class of zrp giving rise to a condensation transition in their stationary state .",
    "we will proceed in two steps .",
    "we study first the system in its mean - field geometry , where all boxes are connected .",
    "this gives then a framework for the study of the one - dimensional system .",
    "the dynamics of the microscopic models defined in  @xcite , or more generally of two - species models satisfying the criterion for phase separation , is more subtle because it involves two ( a priori different ) scales of time : the intra - domain dynamics , corresponding to the equilibration inside a domain , and the inter - domain dynamics , corresponding to the coarsening of domains .",
    "one can therefore wonder whether during its temporal evolution the particle system is equivalent to a zrp with constant hopping rate .",
    "this study is postponed to another publication @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is therefore two - fold .",
    "firstly it addresses the question of the dynamics of zero - range processes _ per se_. indeed , zrp are sufficiently ubiquitous in the field of stochastic processes to warrant the interest of such a study .",
    "for instance , the analysis of the zeta urn model  @xcite is surprisingly close to that presented in the next sections .",
    "secondly it provides a template for the study of the dynamics of particle systems , whenever these can be mapped , at least at a coarse - grained level , to a zrp , as explained above .",
    "the zero - range process studied hereafter is defined as follows . consider a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath15 sites ( or boxes ) , @xmath16 . in each box",
    "we have @xmath17 indistinguishable particles such that @xmath18 the dynamics of the system is given by the rates at which a particle leaves the departure box @xmath19 , containing @xmath20 particles , and is put in the arrival box @xmath21 containing @xmath22 particles .",
    "the hopping rate , denoted by @xmath23 , a priori depends both on @xmath14 and @xmath24 .",
    "a configuration of the system is specified by the occupation numbers @xmath25 , hence a complete knowledge of its dynamics involves the determination of @xmath26 , the probability of finding the system in a given configuration at time @xmath27 . hereafter we will only focus our attention on the probability of finding @xmath14 particles in the generic box @xmath28 , @xmath29 that is , the marginal distribution of the occupation number @xmath30 of this box . conservation of probability and of density yields @xmath31 where we have taken the thermodynamic limit @xmath32 , with fixed density @xmath33 .",
    "suppose now that the system has the mean - field geometry , i.e. , all the boxes are connected . in this case",
    "the temporal evolution of the occupation probability @xmath34 is explicitly given by the master equation @xmath35 where @xmath36 are respectively the rates at which a particle leaves box number 1 ( @xmath37 ) , or arrives in this box ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "this is the master equation for a random walk for @xmath39 , i.e. , on the positive integers @xmath40 .",
    "the equation for @xmath41 is special because one can not select an empty box as a departure box , nor can @xmath39 be negative .",
    "the conservation law @xmath42 , valid at all times , implies the sum rule @xmath43    in the stationary state ( @xmath44 ) , we find @xmath45 which expresses the detailed balance condition at equilibrium , yielding @xmath46 where @xmath47 is fixed by normalisation .",
    "hereafter we are interested in the case where the rate @xmath23 only depends on the occupation of the departure box .",
    "we denote the hopping rate out of the departure box by @xmath48 .",
    "( alternatively one can consider cases where @xmath23 only depends on the occupation of the arrival box , as for the zeta urn model @xcite : @xmath49 is the hopping rate _ into _ the arrival box ; see below . )",
    "we thus have @xmath50 note that ( [ sumrule ] ) is automatically satisfied .",
    "we obtain @xmath51 where @xmath52 , and @xmath53    it is important to emphasize here that the results above , equations ( [ fkeq ] ) and ( [ pk ] ) , also hold for the equivalent one - dimensional zrp in the stationary state . indeed a well - known property of zrp states that in the stationary state the probability @xmath26 is given by a product measure @xcite .",
    "explicitly @xmath26 , with @xmath54 , factorizes into the product @xmath55 , where each factor @xmath56 is equal to @xmath57 as given by ( [ fkeq ] ) and ( [ pk ] ) . for an infinite system this factorization property holds at all time in the mean field geometry , by essence .",
    "let us apply this formalism to the case where , at large @xmath14@xmath58 then it is easy to see that , in the same regime , @xmath59 .",
    "hence the series @xmath60 has a radius of convergence @xmath61 .",
    "the unknown parameter @xmath62 is determined by using ( [ sumrule2 ] ) , which yields @xmath63 this expression is monotonously increasing with @xmath0 . when @xmath0 reaches the value @xmath61 , the right side is converging only if @xmath64 .",
    "therefore we have the following two cases .",
    "@xmath65 if @xmath66 , equation ( [ col ] ) possesses a solution @xmath67 for any value of @xmath68 .",
    "the occupation probabilities are exponentially decaying as @xmath69 where the correlation length @xmath70 .",
    "the system is in a fluid phase .",
    "@xmath65 if @xmath64 , there exists a critical value of the density , where the correlation length diverges , attained when @xmath71 : @xmath72 this is the equation of a transition line .",
    "in other terms , if @xmath73 , then ( [ col ] ) has a solution @xmath67 , in which case the system is in the fluid phase described above ( see equation ( [ fluid ] ) ) . otherwise if @xmath74 , then necessarily @xmath75 .",
    "the system is composed of a critical part and a condensate .",
    "the critical part is described by the algebraically decaying distribution @xmath76 contributing to @xmath77 , as shown by ( [ rocrit ] ) .",
    "the condensate , contributing to the remaining @xmath78 , corresponds to particles sitting in a single box . at criticality ( @xmath79 )",
    "the condensate disappears and ( [ fkeqcrit ] ) still holds .",
    "let us illustrate the above formalism for the explicit choice of hopping rate @xmath80 which is used in the numerical studies of the forthcoming sections .",
    "we have @xmath81 and @xmath82 which is the equation of the critical line in the @xmath83 plane .",
    "it is simple to check using ( [ fkeqcrit_2 ] ) that we have consistently @xmath84 , both at criticality and in the condensed phase .",
    "from now on , we consider a hopping rate @xmath13 out of the departure box of the form ( [ dkasympt ] ) , i.e. , such as @xmath85 at large @xmath14 , and for the sake of analytical or numerical illustrations we will choose the explicit form ( [ dk ] ) , unless specified .",
    "for an infinite system in the mean - field geometry , the knowledge of the occupation probabilities @xmath34 provides a complete description of its dynamics .",
    "we consider a system with poissonian initial distribution of occupation probabilities , @xmath86 i.e. , such that initially particles are distributed at random amongst boxes .",
    "the temporal evolution of the occupation probabilities @xmath87 is given by the master equation @xmath88 this set of equations is non linear because @xmath89 is itself a function of the @xmath34 .",
    "hence there is no explicit solution of these equations in closed form .",
    "yet one can extract from them an analytical description of the dynamics of the system at long times , both in the condensed phase , and at criticality .",
    "the structure of the reasoning borrows to former studies on urn models @xcite .",
    "( for a review , see @xcite . )",
    "as we show below , there exists two different regimes in the evolution of the system , both in the condensed phase or at criticality , which we study successively .      since @xmath84 , we set , for large times , @xmath90 where the small time scale @xmath91 is to be determined .",
    "as shown below , @xmath92 .",

    "this expression carried into ( [ master ] ) yields the stationary equation @xmath44 , because the derivative @xmath96 , proportional to @xmath97 , is negligible compared to the right - hand side .",
    "we thus obtain the detailed balance condition : @xmath98 using ( [ fkeqcrit ] ) and ( [ pk ] ) , we obtain , at leading order in @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and finally @xmath101 at this stage , @xmath102 and the amplitude @xmath103 are still to be determined .

    "we look for a similarity solution of ( [ master ] ) of the form @xmath105 following the treatment of @xcite we obtain for @xmath106 the linear differential equation @xmath107 this is precisely the differential equation found in @xcite .",
    "moreover this method leads to @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "the amplitude @xmath103 can be determined by the fact that the equation has an acceptable solution @xmath106 vanishing as @xmath109 and @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "it is a universal quantity , only depending on the value of @xmath111 .",
    "the normalisation of the solution is fixed by the sum rule ( [ sumrule1 ] ) yielding @xcite @xmath112 the sum rule ( [ sumrule2 ] ) leads to @xcite @xmath113 the differential equation above has no closed form solution .",

    "@xmath114 is universal in the sense that it only depends on the parameter @xmath111 ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "an intuitive description of the dynamics of the condensate in the scaling regime is as follows .",
    "the typical occupancy @xmath115 of the boxes making the condensate scales as @xmath116 .",
    "the total number of particles in the condensate is equal to @xmath117 , the remaining @xmath118 lying in the fluid .",
    "therefore the number of boxes belonging to the condensate scales as @xmath119 .",
    "the analysis follows closely that done in @xcite .",
    "we just sketch the method here .",
    "we set @xmath121 with @xmath122 , where the exponent @xmath123 is to be determined , and we consider the same two regimes as above . in regime",
    "i , we still set ( [ fkreg1 ] ) for @xmath34 .",
    "the reasoning leading to the relationship @xmath124 ( see ( [ vk ] ) ) is still valid here . in regime",

    "it reads    @xmath131 the solution of which is , with @xmath132 , @xmath133 the fall - off of @xmath130 for @xmath134 is very fast : @xmath135 , hence @xmath136 .",
    "we finally obtain @xmath137      to summarize , for any hopping rate of the form @xmath85 , the scaling functions , @xmath106 in the condensed phase ( more precisely : @xmath114 ) , and @xmath130 at criticality , are universal . in both cases",
    "the scaling variable is @xmath138 .",
    "the critical density @xmath77 , and , as a consequence , any quantity depending on @xmath139 , such as the amplitude @xmath102 , are non universal , with values depending on the precise definition of @xmath13 . as noted above , the amplitude @xmath103 is a universal quantity in the condensed phase .",
    "universality can be checked by comparing the results obtained by a numerical integration of the master equation ( [ master ] ) , for different choices of the rate @xmath13 . besides the form @xmath140 of eq .",
    "( [ dk ] ) we investigated the following two other expressions @xmath141     in the condensed phase , for times equal to @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 .",

    "it was obtained with the choice of rate ( [ dk ] ) , with @xmath145 , and for a density @xmath148 .",
    "the curves obtained with the choice ( [ other1 ] ) and @xmath149 , or with ( [ other2 ] ) , are hardly distinguishable from the former one .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] depicts @xmath130 at criticality , for the same range of times , with the choice ( [ dk ] ) , and @xmath145 .",
    "again , the curves obtained with the choice ( [ other1 ] ) , with @xmath149 , or with ( [ other2 ] ) , are indistinguishable from the former one .",
    "the limiting curve of figure  [ f2 ] coincides exactly with the form ( [ gu_anal ] ) .",

    "( @xmath145 , @xmath156 . ) ]    it is remarkable that the universality of the scaling functions @xmath106 and @xmath130 extends beyond the case of the zrp under study .",
    "indeed , for the zeta urn model , defined by a rate @xmath23 only depending on the occupation @xmath24 of the arrival box , much of the formalism above is the same @xcite .",
    "an intuitive explanation of this fact comes from the comparison of the rates of the two models , at large values of time and occupation numbers . consider the rate @xmath157 and @xmath158 defined in equations ( [ mu ] ) and ( [ lam ] ) . for the zrp studied here these rates are given by ( cf .",

    "simple inspection of the last two equations demonstrates the formal analogy between the two models .",
    "this analogy is still stronger if one chooses the rate @xmath13 given by ( [ other2 ] ) .",
    "then , at equilibrium , the formalisms for the corresponding zrp and for the zeta urn model coincide .",
    "the framework of analytic results obtained in the mean - field case provides a guide for the numerical study of the one - dimensional system .",
    "it turns out that most of the features of the former survive in one dimension .",
    "in particular the two regimes of time described in the previous section are still present in the one - dimensional case .",
    "the main difference lies in the values of the dynamical exponent @xmath0 characteristic of the growth of the condensate , and of the critical dynamical exponent @xmath162 characteristic of the growth of critical fluctuations . in the condensed phase ( @xmath163 ) , numerical simulations ,",
    "presented hereafter , give evidence for @xmath164 , instead of @xmath165 in the mean - field geometry . at criticality @xmath166 instead of",
    "@xmath167 , in the mean - field geometry .",

    "step a site @xmath168 is chosen at random and , if not empty , a particle of this site is transferred to one of the two neighbouring site , to the right or to the left with equal probability , with a rate @xmath13 only depending on the number of particles @xmath169 , present on site @xmath168 .",
    "as above , we consider a hopping rate such that @xmath170 at large @xmath14 .",
    "the numerical simulations described below were performed with the choice of rate given by ( [ dk ] ) .      we begin with the determination of the dynamical exponent @xmath0 . in regime",
    "ii ( @xmath14 and @xmath27 simultaneously large ) , let us assume the scaling form , inspired by eq .",
    "( [ fkscalcond ] ) , @xmath171 then , at large time , the mean squared occupation @xmath172 should behave as @xmath173 this quantity is easy to measure , and remains accurate even for relatively large times .",
    "more generally the moment of order @xmath174 , @xmath175 , scales as @xmath176 .",
    "the behaviour ( [ k2_cond ] ) is very well observed in numerical simulations , with @xmath177 ( see figure  [ f4 ] below ) .",

    "however this dependence can be absorbed in a rescaling of time : @xmath185 as demonstrated by figure  [ f4 ] .",
    "it depicts a plot of @xmath186 against @xmath187 , for @xmath182 . in the linear part of the curves , the slopes are all approximatively equal to 3 , in very good agreement with the measured numerical values of the integral in the right side of ( [ k2_cond ] ) , divided by @xmath188 . coming back",
    "to figure  [ f3 ] , plotting @xmath189 against @xmath190 for several densities leads to data collapse , confirming the rescaling of time by the density .",
    "we then determined the characteristics of regime i ( @xmath14 fixed , @xmath27 large ) , for @xmath145 and @xmath191 .",
    "we first observed that eqs.([dbart ] ) , ( [ fkreg1 ] ) and ( [ vk ] ) still hold .",
    "this was checked in a number of ways .",
    "for instance one can plot ( @xmath192 and @xmath193against @xmath194 , yielding straight lines of slopes respectively equal to @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "this leads to @xmath197 , and @xmath198 .",
    "these values are consistent with the relation ( [ rs2_cond ] ) , since the measured value of the integral @xmath199 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath103 also depends on @xmath184 , with values equal respectively to @xmath200 , @xmath201 , and @xmath202 ( for @xmath182 ) , which , when multiplied by @xmath203 , consistently with ( [ rescal ] ) , collapse to a value @xmath204 .",
    "the critical case is harder to analyse numerically , because of the presence of large fluctuations in the system , and because the asymptotic regime is longer to attain .",
    "guided by the mean - field analysis , we expect the dynamics to exhibit two scales of time , corresponding to regime i and ii respectively .",
    "in the latter , let us assume the scaling behaviour , inspired from ( [ fkscal_crit ] ) , @xmath205 where @xmath162 is the critical dynamical exponent .",
    "in order to determine the value of this exponent , we measured @xmath206 for @xmath207 and @xmath208 , and where the notation reminds the fact that , at large values of @xmath14 , @xmath209",

    "( @xmath221 . ) , title=\"fig : \" ]    to gain more understanding of this point , we introduced a bias in the move of a particle out of a box .",
    "a particle now hops to the right with probability @xmath235 and to the left with probability @xmath236.this does not change the stationary state . for any positive value of the bias @xmath237 we found @xmath3 , and @xmath238 ( see figure [ f7 ] ) .",
    "therefore the symmetric and asymmetric one - dimensional zrp belong to two different universality classes . in the extreme case",
    "where @xmath239 , corresponding to the totally asymmetric zrp , there is no diffusion left in the motion of a particle along the line .",
    "one could therefore expect that the totally asymmetric zrp should resemble , at least to some extent , to the mean - field zrp .",
    "it indeed turns out that , in the condensed phase , the scaling function @xmath106 of the former is quantitatively very close to the scaling function of the latter .",
    "moreover , for @xmath239 , the universality of the scaling function @xmath106 with respect to density is restored , without rescaling of time .",
    "( this point was also checked for the value @xmath240 . )",
    "however the fact that , seemingly , @xmath241 is a caveat that the influence of a bias is more subtle . as a first step , it would be interesting to have a better understanding of the role of the bias on the decay of correlations .",
    "a summary of the different cases studied in this work is presented in table  [ table ] .",
    "llll & @xmath230&@xmath242&@xmath243 + @xmath0&2&2&3 + @xmath4&2&@xmath244&@xmath245 +      finding an analytical argument in favour of the values of the exponents appearing in the table is the most immediate challenge .",
    "other immediate points of interest are the determination of the upper critical dimension for the zero - range processes under study , or the explanation of the role of the density in the one - dimensional condensed phase .",
    "the value @xmath177 is reminiscent of the value of the dynamical exponent for the growth of domains in the dynamics of an ising chain under kawasaki dynamics , in the scaling regime of low temperature @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that , for the kawasaki chain , adding a bias induces a change in the dynamic exponent from @xmath177 to @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "moreover it is simple to see that a mean - field version of the model leads to @xmath3 .",
    "think to the low - temperature regime , where the detachment of a spin from a domain is a rare event .",
    "then whenever such an event occurs , one of the spins which are released ( e.g. the ( @xmath7 ) spin ) is immediately transferred to a random location inside a domain of the opposite sign . by diffusion",
    "it will shortly stick to the nearest domain of its sign , thus increasing the size of this domain by one unit , to the expense of the initial domain , far away in the system .",
    "it is clear from this analysis that the mechanism leading to the value @xmath177 in the low - temperature coarsening regime of the kawasaki chain  @xcite no longer works , hence @xmath3 .",
    "other mean - field versions in the same spirit can be invented , with the same result regarding the value of @xmath0 .    trying to draw a closer analogy , beyond these simple observations , between the dynamics of the ising chain under kawasaki dynamics and the dynamics of the one - dimensional zrp",
    "deserves further analysis .",
    "another point of important interest concerns non - stationary aspects of the dynamics .",
    "non stationarity is demonstrated by the behaviour of two - time quantities such as two - time autocorrelation , response and fluctuation - dissipation ratio . at the mean - field level , guided once more by the analysis of the dynamics of the zeta urn model @xcite , we can show that the formalism developed for this model holds for the zrp studied in the present work .",
    "this , as well as the study of the behaviour of two - time quantities for the one - dimensional zrp , will be the subject of another work  @xcite .",
    "the last challenging point concerns the possible relevance of the present work for the description of the class of driven particle systems exhibiting a condensation transition , such as those studied in @xcite .",
    "the question posed is whether these particle systems can be described _ during their temporal evolution _ , and not only at stationarity , in terms of the zero - range processes studied in the present work @xcite .",
    "as a first step one can use the present study as a template , and ask the following questions  @xcite . in the condensed phase , or at criticality , is there a scaling regime , and if so , what are the values of the dynamical exponents ?",
    "what is the role of the density ?",
    "what is the influence of a bias ?",
