    "<S> black line is where the correlation function decays to 0 demonstrating a long - range highly correlated mode for @xmath53 . ]    to extract quantitative information from the configuration of spps , we computed the eigenmodes @xmath54 and eigenvalues @xmath55 of the displacement correlation matrix . in the harmonic theory of crystals , these normal modes fully characterize the linear response of the system to perturbations @xcite . for disordered materials , </S>",
    "<S> these modes convey information about structural stability as well as coherent and localized motion @xcite . plotting the eigenvalue spectrum @xmath55 as a function of mode number @xmath47 averaged over 10 runs with random initial conditions revealed an approximate power - law decay [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](a ) , blue and orange data ] . while the debye model for 2d crystals obeys @xmath45 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](a ) , upper dashed line ] @xcite , the simulation data has an exponent between -1 and -2 . using a random matrix model of uncorrelated gaussian variables as a control for decoherent motion [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](a ) , black dotted line ] ( supplemental materials ) @xcite , we see the lowest six eigenmodes contain information about correlated motion . </S>",
    "<S> plotting displacement vector fields for a few eigenmodes , we indeed find a higher degree of spatial correlation for lower @xmath47 that rapidly diminishes with increasing mode number [ fig .  [ fig:2](b ) ] . to quantify this observation , we measured the polarization of the each mode s vector field and calculated the correlation function for this order parameter ( supplemental materials ) @xcite . remarkably , we find the first eigenmode carries a system - spanning displacement modulation [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](c ) , @xmath53 ] , whereas the correlation for higher modes rapidly decays over a few particle diameters [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](c ) , @xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> to understand the origins of this long wavelength mode , we note the point of interest @xmath1 breaks @xmath58 translational symmetry , and therefore the goldstone theorem implies the existence of low - frequency long - wavelength deformations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this goldstone mode is expected to arise at low @xmath47 since eigenvalues are related to vibrational frequencies by @xmath59 , and the largest eigenvalue in the spectrum occurs at the lowest mode number [ fig .  [ fig:2](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the system - spanning @xmath53 eigenmode is the system s goldstone boson ; when excited , it drives the spps to move collectively as one @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an example of a disaster resulting from this type of coherent long - range motion is known as `` crowd crush '' @xcite . in these situations , a large number of people are suddenly displaced toward a wall , fence , or other architectural element resulting in dangerously high pressures @xcite . as a consequence , injuries and death </S>",
    "<S> are known to occur . determining if goldstone modes are responsible for crowd crush would require careful image analysis of crowd structure and motion in the moments before such an event . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we expect any large dense gathering of people to exhibit this type of long - range collective behavior since its origins can be traced to the general principle of symmetry breaking .     away from @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) structure factor @xmath60 measures the pair - wise spp distribution and reveals structural features distinguishing spps in soft spots that suggest why they are subject to large displacements . ]    </S>",
    "<S> another type of disaster found at high - density social gatherings is when sudden unexpected movements of the crowd cause individuals to trip and fall . because the majority of people are unaware this accident has happened , the rest of the crowd continues to move largely uninterrupted , resulting in injury or death due to trampling or compressive asphyxia @xcite </S>",
    "<S> this is more general than the excitation of a pure goldstone mode , and is better characterized by a superposition of modes . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we focus on the particles that displace significantly more than average in a given mode @xmath47 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](a ) , displacement threshold is 2.5 standard deviations more than average ] ( supplemental materials ) . </S>",
    "<S> studies of jammed granular media show these particles , which tend to cluster in regions called `` soft spots , '' correlate with structural rearrangements when the system is perturbed @xcite . superimposing data from the first 10 modes of a single simulation run </S>",
    "<S> reveals a soft spot near the core of the aggregate [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> regions along the perimeter also featured large displacements , but they are essentially underconstrained edge effects and therefore not relevant for our analysis . identifying spps </S>",
    "<S> undergoing the largest displacements in each mode up to @xmath61 in all simulation runs showed the region near the core of the crowd is the most likely area to find soft spots [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](b ) , peak centered on @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> cross - correlating soft spot spps with their real - space dynamics confirmed these particles typically displace the greatest amount despite being confined within a disordered aggregate [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](a ) ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we further studied the relation between structural disorder and large displacements in soft spots by measuring the pairwise distribution @xmath60 as a function of distance @xmath63 between particles ( supplemental materials ) and found that soft spot spps have an intrinsically different structure compared to the average population [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](c ) ] . the plateaued region in @xmath60 around @xmath64 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](c ) full line ] indicates soft spot spps are more highly squeezed by some of their neighbors , while the shifted peak centered on @xmath65 indicates they re also further away than average from other neighbors [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](c ) , dashed line peak at @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> these data suggest soft spot spps are being compressed tightly in one direction , and as a consequence displace greater amounts in the orthogonal direction . as such </S>",
    "<S> , structural disorder is fundamental for large displacements and rearrangements [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](a ) ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we hypothesize soft spots in human crowds pose the greatest risk for tripping and subsequent trampling . if found true , real - time image analysis identifying soft spots in densely - packed human crowds may provide useful predictive power for preventing injuries .    </S>",
    "<S> our results thus far have focused on structural origins of collective motion with all model parameters kept constant . in real life situations , </S>",
    "<S> not all people behave the same : some agitate more easily , others less so @xcite . accordingly , we modify the asocial model to study how mechanisms for coherent collective motion are affected by active perturbations from within . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we introduce a second population of spps so that a fraction @xmath67 exhibits a more agitated behavior , while the remaining fraction @xmath68 of the population are the same as before @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we model these agitated spps with a larger distribution of force fluctuations in @xmath8 by increasing their standard deviation to @xmath69 , and analyzing the two parameter phase space made of @xmath67 and @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the case @xmath71 and vary @xmath67 from 0 to 1 . calculating the spectrum of eigenvalues </S>",
    "<S> @xmath55 shows the qualitative trends are independent of @xmath67 , though numerical values of @xmath55 tend to increase with more agitators ( supplemental materials ) . to understand how long - range collective motion is affected by agitated spps , we measured the polarization correlation function for the first 10 modes by varying @xmath70 and @xmath67 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] ] . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the correlation functions for @xmath71 at various values of @xmath67 show a qualitative transition unanticipated from the eigenvalue spectrum . for @xmath72 , </S>",
    "<S> a long - range correlated goldstone mode is observed as before . </S>",
    "<S> however , multiple long - range correlated modes are observed for @xmath73 , and no long - range correlated modes are observed for @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> examining other values of @xmath70 shows a similar transition with increasing @xmath67 from a single well - defined long - range mode , to multiple long - range modes , to no long - range modes whatsoever [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] , rows left - to - right ] .     of agitated spps with variance @xmath70 in @xmath8 to the total population @xmath0 probes structural origins of collective motion . </S>",
    "<S> each heat map is the polarization correlation function for the first 10 eigenmodes as a function of distance @xmath52 ( same as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> low fluctuations ( white background ) preserve the long - range highly - correlated goldstone mode near @xmath53 . high fluctuations ( dark gray background ) destroy long - range correlated modes . </S>",
    "<S> intermediate fluctuations ( light gray background ) add new modes with long - range correlations , indicating stochastic resonance . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the low - agitation and high - agitation limits are intuitive . for low agitation [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] , white region ] , additional force fluctuations through increasing @xmath70 with low @xmath67 or increasing @xmath67 with low @xmath70 induce small perturbations to the overall structure . as such , the existence of a goldstone mode at low @xmath47 is anticipated based on the homogeneous population results [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](c ) ] . for high agitation where the combined effect of @xmath70 and @xmath67 is large [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] , dark gray shaded region ] , we expect local structure of the aggregated spps to break down and correlated motion to be marginalized . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with this reasoning , we find no long - range modes in the high - agitation limit ( supplemental materials ) .    between the high and low agitation limit </S>",
    "<S> , we find a boundary in the @xmath75 phase diagram characterized by multiple long - range modes [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] , light gray shaded region ] . </S>",
    "<S> this result is striking because it shows moderate levels of noise induces new coherent modes . noting that correlated motion allows mechanical information to be transferred across the aggregate , an appearance of multiple long - range modes implies greater information bandwidth . in certain settings , signal enhancement mediated by noise </S>",
    "<S> is called _ stochastic resonance _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> stochastic resonance can be found in systems where nonlinear effects dampen signal propagation , but by introducing random noise , the effects of nonlinear terms are reduced leading to a restoration of signal propagation . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear effects come from structural packing disorder that suppresses conventional phonon modes found in ordered 2d systems . </S>",
    "<S> random noise from agitators increases an internal pressure @xcite within the aggregate that helps break - up this heterogeneous structure . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , additional phonon modes are able to reassert their presence . in the context of our model </S>",
    "<S> , this finding means that modest random fluctuations can enhance overall collective motion , which increases the potential for injurious outcomes in high - density crowds .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of collective motion in dense crowd simulations relies on trajectory data in order to identify and understand the emergence of goldstone modes , soft spots , and stochastic resonance . with an eye to crowd safety , the dependence on readily measurable quantities combined with computer vision techniques @xcite provides significant potential for applications in real - time crowd management . in the long - run </S>",
    "<S> this may help protect attendees at large gatherings by reducing emergent risks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more theoretically , the observation of goldstone modes hints that a collective motion analogous to the higgs particle may also be found in future studies of crowd speed modulations . indeed , developing an effective field theory with quasi - particle - like excitations could present new opportunities to understand emergent collective motions , their interactions , and potential hazards </S>"
