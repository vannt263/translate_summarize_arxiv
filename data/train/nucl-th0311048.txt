    "two - particle interferometry , which exploits the bose - einstein symmetrization effects on the production cross section for pairs of identical bosons , has become a powerful tool to extract detailed space - time information about the freeze - out configuration of the hot and dense fireballs formed in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "recent exciting data on transverse flow anisotropies in non - central heavy - ion collisions and their interpretation as evidence for early and efficient thermalization at rhic energies @xcite have generated new interest in a better understanding of the space - time structure of the deformed sources created in these collisions .",
    "this requires the generalization of the hbt interferometry tool from azimuthally symmetric sources ( reviewed in @xcite ) to deformed situations .",
    "applications of this new formalism to recent rhic data are reported in the following article by m.  lisa .    for chaotic sources ( i.e. independent particle emission )",
    ", the two - particle bose - einstein correlation function @xmath0 can be expressed through a fourier transform of the _ emission function _",
    "@xmath1 which describes the single - particle phase - space distribution at freeze - out @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 is the average momentum of the pair while @xmath3 is the relative momentum between the two particles .",
    "the fourier transform in @xmath3 is restricted by the _ mass - shell constraint _",
    "@xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the pair velocity ) and therefore not fully invertible .",
    "the extraction of the emission function @xmath1 from the measured correlation function @xmath6 thus requires additional theoretical input @xcite .",
    "if the source is dominated by a single length scale ( its `` size '' ) , the emission function can , for every momentum @xmath2 , be approximated by a gaussian in space - time whose width parameters form a symmetric tensor , the _ spatial correlation tensor _",
    "@xmath7({\\bm{k } } ) \\equiv\\langle\\tilde x_\\mu\\tilde x_\\nu\\rangle$ ] .",
    "the correlation function is then also a gaussian in the relative momentum @xmath3 , @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 denotes the beam direction , @xmath10 the transverse emission direction @xmath11 of the pair , and @xmath12 the third cartesian direction perpendicular to @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the transverse emission direction @xmath2 is characterized by an azimuthal angle @xmath13 with respect to the reaction plane formed by the beam axis and the impact parameter @xmath14 . in collisions between spherical nuclei",
    "the emission function is reflection symmetric with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "this and other , more specific symmetries of the emission function are most easily expressed in a reaction - plane - fixed coordinate system where @xmath15 points along the beam direction , @xmath16 along the impact parameter , and @xmath17 perpendicular to the reaction plane . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlation radii @xmath18 are more easily interpreted in the @xmath19 system because the @xmath20-dependence , being transverse to the pair velocity @xmath21 , is not affected by the mixing of space and time induced by the mass - shell constraint into the fourier transform .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath22 systems are rotated with respect to each other by the azimuthal emission angle @xmath13 .",
    "the fourier transform between the emission and correlation functions the leads to the following relations between the `` hbt radii '' @xmath18 and the components of the spatial correlation tensor @xmath23 @xcite : @xmath24 these relations display the _ explicit _ @xmath13-dependence arising from the mentioned rotation between the @xmath22 and @xmath19 systems , but hide the _ implicit _ @xmath13-dependence of the spatial correlation tensor components @xmath25 .",
    "the total emission angle dependence of the hbt radii results from a combination of both explicit and implicit @xmath13-dependences @xcite .",
    "the implicit @xmath13-dependence of the spatial correlation tensor is restricted by symmetries of the source @xcite .",
    "it is a relativistic effect associated with an azimuthal spatial source deformation superimposed by strong transverse collective flow @xcite which vanishes with the @xmath26 power of the transverse flow velocity @xmath27 for weak or no collective expansion @xcite .",
    "a full analysis of the symmetry constraints on @xmath28 for symmetric collisions between spherical nuclei and for pairs detected in a symmetric rapidity window around @xmath29 can be found in ref .",
    "one finds the following _ most general _",
    "form for the azimuthal oscillations of the hbt radii : @xmath30 we see that only even _ or _ odd sine _ or _ cosine terms occur , but no mixtures of such terms .",
    "statistical errors in the resolution of the reaction plane angle as well as finite angular bin sizes in @xmath13 tend to reduce the actually measured oscillation amplitudes ; fortunately , these dilution effects can be fully corrected by a model - independent correction algorithm @xcite .",
    "a gaussian fit to the thus corrected correlation function , binned in @xmath31 , @xmath32 and emission angle @xmath13 , then yields the `` true '' hbt radius parameters @xmath33 from which the @xmath34 order azimuthal oscillation amplitudes are extracted via @xmath35 here @xmath36 indicates the number of ( equally spaced ) @xmath13 bins in the data and @xmath37 stands for @xmath38 or @xmath39 as appropriate , see eqs.([24 ] ) .",
    "( note that nyquist s theorem limits the number of harmonics that can be extracted to @xmath40 . )",
    "we would like to relate the azimuthal oscillation amplitudes of the 6 hbt radius parameters to the geometric and dynamical anisotropies of the source , as reflected in the azimuthal oscillations of the 10 independent components of the spatial correlation tensor .",
    "their allowed oscillation patterns at midrapidity @xmath29 are given by @xcite @xmath41 the missing terms in the sums over @xmath42 have amplitudes which are odd functions of @xmath31 and vanish at midrapidity .",
    "they do , however , contribute to the hbt radii if the data are averaged over a finite , symmetric rapidity window around @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "their contributions can be eliminated by varying the width @xmath43 of this rapidity window and extrapolating quadratically to @xmath44 .",
    "note that @xmath45 by symmetry , i.e. the corresponding components of @xmath46 oscillate around zero .",
    "the oscillation amplitudes of the hbt radii relate to the oscillation amplitudes of the source parameters as follows : for the odd harmonics @xmath47 we have @xmath48 whereas the even harmonics @xmath49 satisfy @xmath50 in these relations it is understood that all negative harmonic coefficients @xmath51 as well as @xmath52 and @xmath53 are zero . the angular brackets @xmath54 indicate an average over a finite , symmetric rapidity window around @xmath29 .",
    "the terms involving the longitudinal pair velocity @xmath55 vanish quadratically as the width @xmath43 of that window shrinks to zero .    even after extrapolating to @xmath29 in this way , we have still many more source parameters than measurable hbt amplitudes .",
    "one counts easily that up to @xmath56 there are 9 measurable fourier coefficients which ( at @xmath29 ) depend on 19 source amplitudes .",
    "from there on , increasing @xmath42 by 2 yields 6 additional measured amplitudes which depend on 10 additional source amplitudes .",
    "this lack of analysis power is an intrinsic weakness of the hbt microscope and due to the fundamental restrictions arising from the mass - shell constraint @xmath57 .",
    "the reconstruction of the source thus must necessarily rely on additional assumptions .",
    "one such assumption which may not be too unreasonable is that the emission duration @xmath58 is approximately independent of emission angle and that the source is sufficiently smooth that higher order harmonics @xmath59 of @xmath46 can be neglected .",
    "such source properties would result in the `` wiedemann sum rule '' @xcite @xmath60 which can be experimentally tested .",
    "if verified for all @xmath32 it would provide strong support for the underlying assumptions on the source . in this case",
    "we can measure 3 azimuthally averaged hbt radii and 5 independent oscillation amplitudes with @xmath61 , depending on 14 source parameters of which 5 can be eliminated by going to @xmath62 ( see @xcite for explicit expressions ) .",
    "this makes the geometry of the effective source for particles with @xmath63 `` almost solvable '' @xcite , as confirmed by hydrodynamical calculations @xcite which show that at @xmath63 the effective emission region closely tracks the overall geometry of the source even if it is strongly and anisotropically expanding .",
    "the source geometry can be completely reconstructed from hbt data if transverse flow is so weak that all implicit @xmath13-dependence ( i.e. all higher harmonics @xmath64 ) of @xmath46 can be neglected . in this case one",
    "obtains at @xmath29 the `` geometric relations '' @xcite @xmath65 @xmath66 describes the average transverse size and @xmath67 ( which generates a second - order harmic in the transverse hbt radii ) the transverse deformation of the source .",
    "@xmath68 generates a first - order harmonic in the @xmath69 and @xmath70 cross terms and describes a longitudinal tilt of the source away from the beam direction @xcite .",
    "such a tilt was found in au+au collisions at the ags @xcite .",
    "its sign yielded important information on the kinetic pion production mechanism @xcite .",
    "azimuthally sensitive hbt interfrometry is a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamic origin and space - time manifestations of the strong anisotropic collective flow seen in single - particle spectra at rhic .",
    "symmetries strongly constrain the azimuthal fourier series of the emission angle dependent hbt radii . this is helpful but not sufficient for a fully model independent reconstruction of the source deformations from such data . to separate temporal from geometric contributions to the hbt radii",
    ", the source must satisfy special properties .",
    "one can test for them experimentally , albeit not in a fully model - independent way .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations @xcite ( which were reported at the meeting but are not included here ) show that at rhic and lhc energies emission from the source at non - zero transverse momentum is very strongly surface dominated ( `` source opacity '' ) . to obtain an unambiguous estimate of the transverse deformation of the source at freeze -",
    "out one should study the @xmath13-oscillations of the hbt radii at very small @xmath32 .",
    "a possible longitudinal tilt of the source away from the beam direction manifests itself through first - order harmonics in @xmath71 and @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath32-dependence of the oscillation patterns of the transverse hbt radius parameters can be analyzed to obtain evidence for or against a faster expansion of the source in - plane than out - of - plane due to anisotropic collective flow @xcite .",
