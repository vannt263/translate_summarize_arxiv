    "photons are a natural choice for making qubits because the quantum information encoded can have a long decoherence time and is easy to manipulate and measure . also , photonic qubits are the only type of qubits that are feasible for long distance quantum communication .",
    "quantum information processing requires universal two - qubit entangling gates .",
    "knill et al  @xcite showed that it is theoretically possible to do scalable quantum computing with linear optics by using measurement induced interactions to perform the two - qubit gates .",
    "however , despite a continuous effort in reducing the resource requirement  @xcite , the resource overhead is still high for linear optical quantum computing .",
    "franson et al@xcite proposed the use of two - photon absorption non - linearity and exploiting the quantum zeno effect to implement a control sign ( cz ) gate that requires much less resources than linear optics schemes .",
    "however , the problem with the zeno gate is that photon loss affects the performance of the zeno gate significantly and the single photon to two - photon loss ratio requirement is very stringent .",
    "one solution couldbe to combine measurement induced quantum processing with the zeno gate .",
    "previously we have shown that when using the zeno gate for qubit fusion  @xcite , state distillation  @xcite with post - selection can boost the gate fidelity to unity and that for less stringent absorption ratios the gate has an advantage in success probability over linear optics gates for fusing clusters of qubits .",
    "these clusters of qubits can then be used for cluster state quantum computing  @xcite .",
    "in addition , myers and gilchrist  @xcite have shown that the performance of the zeno gate may be enhanced by using error correction codes such as redundancy and parity encoding .    here",
    "we design a high fidelity zeno cnot gate suitable for circuit - based quantum computing .",
    "although with the current estimate of the photon loss ratio , only a poor fidelity zeno gate is directly achievable , here we show that it is possible to use two of these zeno gates to do bell measurements and implement a gottesman - chuang@xcite teleportation type of cnot gate ( gc - zeno gate ) that , like the fusion gate , gives high fidelity via state distillation and moderate success probability via partially off - line state preparation .",
    "we include the effect of mode - mismatch and detector efficiency on the scheme and estimate lower bounds on the parameter which in principle allow fault tolerant operation .",
    "+ the paper is arranged in the following way .",
    "the introduction continues with a subsection on the zeno cz gate , which describes the scheme and modelling of the gate and give descriptions on the modelling parameters that are also used for modelling the gc - zeno cz gate . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the gc - zeno gate and the effect of mode - mismatch and detector efficiency on the gate . in section iii , we give estimates of the lower bounds on the photon loss ratio and mode - matching , followed by a subsection on the advantage in using state distillation .",
    "we conclude and summarize in section iv .",
    "franson et al s control sign gate scheme consists of a pair of optical fibers weakly evanescently coupled and doped with two - photon absorbing atoms .",
    "the purpose of the two - photon absorbers is to suppress the occurrence of two photon state components in the two fibre modes via the quantum zeno effect .",
    "this allows the state to remain in the computational basis . after a length of fibre corresponding to a complete swap of the two fibre modes",
    ", a @xmath2 phase difference is produced between the @xmath3 term and the other three basis terms .",
    "after swapping the fibre modes by simply crossing them , a cz gate is achieved .",
    "the gate becomes near deterministic and performs a near unitary operation when the quantum zeno effect is strong and photon loss is insignificant .",
    "however , with current technology , the strength of the quantum zeno effect is a few orders of magnitude below what is required , and thus the zeno gate has significant photon loss .",
    "+ in  @xcite , the gate is modelled as a succession of @xmath4 weak beamsplitters followed by two - photon absorbers as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ourcsign ] . as @xmath5 the model tends to the continuous coupling limit envisaged for the physical realization .",
    "the gate operates on the single - rail encoding for which @xmath6 and @xmath7 with the kets representing photon fock states .",
    "[ fig : cz ] shows how the single rail cz can be converted into a dual rail  @xcite cz with logical encoding @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 be the total length of @xmath4 absorbers .",
    "also , let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be the probability of single photon and two - photon transmission respectively for one absorber . here the parameter @xmath13 , where @xmath10 is the length of the absorber and @xmath14 is the corresponding proportionality constant related to the absorption cross section .",
    "furthermore , @xmath1 specifies the relative strength of the two transmissions and relates them by @xmath15 .",
    "this cz gate does the following operation :    @xmath16 is given by : @xmath17    the explicit form of the @xmath18 state components are suppressed , as they lie outside the computational basis and so do not explicitly contribute to the fidelity .",
    "+    from equation  [ eqn : incomplete ] , it is clear that the amplitude of the four computational states are unequal and this lowers the gate fidelity . with the current best estimate of @xmath0 ,",
    "the unherald fidelity is only 0.94 .",
    "if the gate is used in a measurement based strategy then state distillation can be used and the fidelity of the gate can be improved by trading off some success probability .",
    "figure  [ fig : two_photon_distill ] shows the distillated zeno cz gate circuit .",
    "the @xmath19 gate is simply an interferometer consisting of two 50 - 50 beam splitters with a two - photon absorber in each arm , which gives operation : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "here @xmath24 is the single photon transmission coefficient of the absorber .",
    "the distillation beam splitters labelled 1 to 3 have transmission coefficient @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 respectively . with these distillations in place ,",
    "the operation of the distillated zeno cz gate is :    @xmath28    after measuring the output ( detectors at output are not shown in fig.[fig : two_photon_distill ] ) and treating the photon bunching terms ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) and the terms with photon loss as failures ( excluded from eq .",
    "[ eqn : distillated_cz ] for clarity ) , renormalising the states gives unit heralded fidelity independent of @xmath31 and probability of success @xmath32 .",
    "as argued above , state distillation can improve the fidelity of the zeno gate to unity by trading off success probability .",
    "however , the output of the distillated zeno gate contains terms outside the computational basis due to photon loss and photon bunching .",
    "hence if we want the gate to have unit fidelity , it is necessary to measure the output and exclude these failure terms by post - selection .",
    "however , such post - selection means that the gate can no longer be used directly as a cnot gate for circuit - based quantum computing .",
    "+ gottesman and chuang  @xcite showed the viability in using state teleportation and single qubit operations to implement a cnot gate .",
    "the scheme requires the four qubit entangled state @xmath33 . preparing the entangled state",
    "requires a cz operation , which can be done off - line with linear optics with high fidelity .",
    "bell measurements are made between the input qubits and the first and last qubits of @xmath34 .",
    "the measurement results are fed forward for some single qubit corrections such that the circuit gives a proper cnot operation .",
    "here we propose using such scheme , as shown in figure  [ fig : gc_zeno ] , to implement a gc - zeno cnot gate with high fidelity .",
    "since this gate includes state distillation , post - selection and off - line state preparation , the gate has unit fidelity ( under perfect mode - matching ) and moderate success probability .",
    "figure  [ fig : psuccess_gc_zeno ] plots the probability of success against the one - photon to two - photon transmission ratio @xmath1 .",
    "it shows that with @xmath0 ( current best estimate ) , the probability of success is about 0.76 , which is better than the break even point of 0.25 for the linear optics version of this gate  @xcite .",
    "+      from source preparation to gate operation to detection , mode - mismatch is an unavoidable issue in optical quantum computing that causes unlocated errors which lowers the fidelity of the device gate causes unlocated error that lowers the fidelity , in which we find that it can not be improved with state distillation . ] .",
    "fortunately , with the help of quantum error correction , a certain amount of unlocated error rate , including but not limited to mode - mismatch errors , can be tolerated",
    ". a reliable quantum gate must therefore have unlocated error rates below this threshold .",
    "the dominant source of mode - mismatch error in the gc - zeno gate is from the cz gate and @xmath19 gate , where two - photon interaction occurs .",
    "here we follow rohde et al s  @xcite analysis to examine the effect of such error .",
    "we take the simplest model in which the mode - mismatch is present between the photons entering the gate but remain constant through the gate . in this case , the mode - mismatch in two - photon interaction can be analysed as having two - photons fail to interact with some probability .",
    "this allows us to write the operations for the cz gate as follow , where @xmath35 quantifies the overlap of the two wavepackets .",
    "@xmath36 is the probability that the two photons successfully interacted and @xmath37 for completely mode - mismatched and @xmath38 for completely mode - matched .",
    "the bar in the @xmath39 term indicates mode - mismatched component of the state .",
    "@xmath40    and similarly for the operations of @xmath19 gate :    @xmath41    with the equations for the cz and @xmath19 gate gate is less effective in two - photon distillation .",
    "it is true that we can increase the two - photon absorption strength in the @xmath19 gate to make up for the inefficiency .",
    "however , here we assume that we do not know the mode - matching parameter @xmath42 of the input wavepackets , and therefore this adjustment can not be made .",
    "in addition , increasing the two - photon distillation will increase single - photon loss as well , which lowers the probability of success . ] , and given a normalized input state @xmath43 , we can obtain analytical expression for the fidelity @xmath44 ( per qubit ) and success probability @xmath45 ( per qubit ) of the gc - zeno gate as follow .",
    "equation  [ eqn : f ] and  [ eqn : ps ] show that both the fidelity and success probability are state dependent due to mode - mismatch .",
    "the worst case of fidelity occurs when the input state is the equal superposition state @xmath46 ( i.e. @xmath47 ) and the worst case of success probability occurs when the input state is the pure state @xmath48 ( i.e. @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) .",
    "@xmath51    @xmath52    where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60      in practice , even for the most advanced photon detector , detector inefficiency is always present .",
    "the effect of this noise is to reduce the probability of success of the gate but not the fidelity because the errors are locatable .",
    "we now wish to estimate lower bounds on the mode - matching , @xmath42 , and photon loss ratio , @xmath1 , that will still allow fault - tolerant operation .",
    "we allow a small amount of detector inefficiency but assume all other parameters are ideal . to make this estimate we directly use the bounds obtained by dawson et al  @xcite for a deterministic error correction protocol . for this protocol",
    ", they numerically derived one bound using the 7-qubit steane code and another bound using the 23-qubit golay code .    in order to use the dawson et al s bounds we need to identify the unlocated and located error rates for our gate .",
    "in general , the unlocated error rate is less than @xmath61 but here we take it to be @xmath61 because in our analysis , @xmath62 is almost 1 , which means the other terms involved are very small .",
    "the located error rate is simply @xmath63 ( both @xmath44 and @xmath45 are per qubit ) . using these relationships ,",
    "we convert each of the bounds into a fidelity versus success probability bound . for a gate built with two - photon absorbers that have a certain single - photon to two - photon transmission ratio @xmath1",
    ", we can find an optimal @xmath31 ( i.e. choosing an optimal absorber length ) that gives a maximum success probability .",
    "hence , by matching the success probability with the bound , we can determine the corresponding fidelity threshold and therefore find the least amount of mode - matching required for fault tolerant gate operation .",
    "we note that the error model used by dawson et al is specific to their optical cluster state architecture and will differ in detail from the appropriate error model for the gc - zeno gate .",
    "nonetheless we assume that a comparison based on the total error rates will give a good estimate of the bounds .",
    "figure  [ fig : gammavskappaavg ] shows the lower bounds on the mode - matching parameter @xmath42 for a gate with a certain @xmath1 . since the fidelity and success probability are state dependent due to mode - mismatch , in that figure , we have plotted for the case of worst fidelity input state ( i.e. the equal superposition state ) .",
    "the top and bottom curves are best fit curves for using the 7-qubit steane code and the 23-qubit golay code respectively .",
    "the curves show that highly mode - matched photons are essential for robust gate operation . with the worst fidelity input state ,",
    "@xmath46 , for the steane code , the lowest @xmath42 required for fault tolerant operation is about 0.998 , where @xmath64 , and for the golay code , the lowest @xmath42 required is about 0.996 , where @xmath65 .",
    "with the worst success probability input state , @xmath48 , for the steane code , the lowest @xmath42 required for fault tolerant operation is about 0.995 , where @xmath64 , and for the golay code , the lowest @xmath42 required is about 0.989 , where @xmath65 .",
    "figure  [ fig : gammavskappaavg ] also shows that under ( near ) perfect mode - matching , the required @xmath1 can be as low as approximately 6000 for the steane code and 2000 for the golay code .",
    "two - photon absorbers with such @xmath1 values may be achievable with the best of current technology .",
    "+      state distillation allows us to trade off some success probability against fidelity for the gc - zeno gate , or in other words , reducing the unlocated error rate by having a larger located error rate .",
    "since the deterministic error correction protocol can tolerate both unlocated and located errors , therefore we should ask whether state distillation is truly advantageous ? we can answer this question by comparing two gc - zeno gates in the case of perfect mode matching , where one has complete distillation and the other has no distillation . for the case of complete distillation , the deterministic error correction protocol with the 7-qubit steane code can tolerate errors of a gc - zeno gate with @xmath66 , and with the 23-qubit golay code , it can tolerate errors of a gc - zeno gate with @xmath67 . for state distillation to be advantageous under the same protocol",
    ", these values of @xmath1 must be smaller than the values of @xmath1 for the case of no distillation value .",
    "however such large non - linearity is difficult to engineer .",
    "hence it is desirable to have a gate that works with modest @xmath1 . ] .    for the case of no distillation ,",
    "the fidelity and success probability of the gate becomes state dependent . in the parameters space of interest , the input that gives",
    "the worst fidelity is @xmath68 . with this input state",
    ", we find that for the protocol using the 7-qubit steane code and no distillation , the critical @xmath1 is 12000 .",
    "similarly , for the protocol using the 23-qubit golay code and no distillation , the critical @xmath1 is 4300 . with an arbitrary amount of distillation",
    ", the value of @xmath1 lies between the limit of no distillation and full distillation cases .",
    "hence it is evident that state distillation is advantageous .",
    "also , it should be noted it is better to have only located error , which is the case when there is full distillation , than have both located and unlocated errors , which is the case when no or some distillation is utilized .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that it is possible to build a high fidelity zeno cnot gate with two distillated zeno gates implemented in the gottesman - chuang teleportation cnot scheme .",
    "for one - photon to two - photon transmission ratio @xmath0 ( current best estimate ) , the gate has a success probability of 0.76 under perfect mode - matching . when including measurement noise that equals one - tenth of the gate s noise , and the effect of mode - mismatch in the cz and @xmath19 gate , we find that with the deterministic error correction protocol using the 7-qubit steane code , the lowest @xmath42 required for fault tolerant gate operation is 0.998 , where @xmath64 . for using the 23-qubit golay code ,",
    "the lowest @xmath42 required is 0.996 , where @xmath65 .",
