    "this size difference between interstitials and the surrounding crystal is not an artifact of the simulation method : although the trial moves used in semigrand - canonical simulations are unphysical , the resulting size distribution of interstitials is real . the non - gaussian particle size distribution in the crystal should be interpreted as a result of fractionation@xcite of the coexisting fluid ( with the same pressure and polydispersity control parameter @xmath15 ) .",

    "the values for @xmath95 at the polydispersities from table  [ pdd : restab ] are shown in fig  [ pdd : figraph ] . to be able to compare values of @xmath95 over a large range of @xmath98 ,",

    "the crosses denote the means of the interstitial sizes for the corresponding polydispersities . ]",
    "the similarity in slopes and actual values of the @xmath100 curves is striking ; it means that , for the full range of polydispersities at which a crystal is stable , the partial interstitial concentration depends on the chemical potential distribution and an interstitial free energy which seems to be only weakly dependent on the polydispersity : @xmath101 with @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 as fitted parameters from the points in fig  [ pdd : figraph ] .",
    "although the form of this equation was taken from the analytical estimate for the interstitial concentration of ref .  , which gives physical meanings to the values of @xmath105 and @xmath106 and has reasonable agreement for @xmath106 , we stress that , here , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are simply fit parameters .",
    "because @xmath107 hardly depends on the width and , presumably , the shape of the particle size distribution , the small particle tail of the particle size distribution becomes crucial : those particles have the lowest @xmath107 and will form the most important contribution to the interstitial concentration .",
    "for example , at the near - gaussian polydispersity of @xmath108 , obtained by setting @xmath109 , practically all particles with diameter smaller than @xmath110 of the mean particle radius are interstitials .",
    "this implies that the polydispersity , as measured by the second moment of the particle size distribution in the liquid , is _ not _ a good predictor for the interstitial concentration in the solid .",
    "the _ tail _ of the particle size distribution in the liquid is hard to measure , yet it is all - important for the interstitial concentration .    in the case of vacancies ,",
    "similar considerations apply in a slightly different form ; the vacancy concentration depends on the chemical potential and the free energy of removing a particle while keeping its lattice site .",
    "as argued above , they both stay relatively constant at melting for increasing polydispersities which causes the concentration of vacancies to remain roughly similar .    to get an estimate for the interstitial concentration of a colloidal crystal in a suspension , the solely @xmath6-dependent expression of eq .",
    "[ pdd : fitfi ] must be combined with an estimate for the chemical potential distribution @xmath111 , which , in the more conventional ensembles of the experimental situation , does not only depend on the density and the mean particle size , but also on the subsequent moment of the particle size distribution , the polydispersity @xcite .",
    "an estimate for the absolute values of the chemical potential distribution can be obtained by combining eq .",
    "[ pdd : mufunc ] and the results of table [ pdd : restab ] .    in summary , we have shown that for polydisperse hard - sphere crystals along the melting curve , the interstitial concentration increases dramatically ( going up to 2% ) while the vacancy concentration remains relatively constant .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that , with increasing polydispersity , there is an increasing probability of finding a particle small enough to have an appreciable probability of fitting in a hole of the underlying crystalline lattice .",
    "this finding has practical implication for the preparation of colloidal crystals from slightly polydisperse solutions . as the presence of interstitials may affect the optical properties of colloidal crystals , it is important to control their concentration .",
    "the present calculations show that the interstitial concentration depends sensitively on the _ tail _ of the size distribution in the liquid phase .",
    "hence , the polydispersity as such does not provide a reliable criterion to predict interstitial concentrations .",
    "rather , it will be necessary to have an accurate representation of the functional form of the tail of the particle - size distribution ( in particular , on the small-@xmath6 side ) .",
