    "a number of _ in vitro _ and _ in vivo _",
    "studies  @xcite have shown neuronal avalanches  cascades of neuronal firing  that may exhibit power law statistics in the relationship between avalanche size and occurrence .",
    "this has been used as _ prima facie _ evidence that the brain may be operating near , or at , criticality  @xcite . in turn , these results have generated considerable interest because a brain at or near criticality would have maximum dynamic range  @xcite enabling it to optimally react and adapt to the dynamics of the surrounding environment  @xcite whilst maintaining balanced neuronal activity  @xcite .",
    "neuropathological states ( e.g. , epileptic seizures ) could then be conceptualised as a breakdown of , or deviation from , the critical state , see  @xcite , for example .",
    "furthermore , these findings have led to the notion that the brain may self - organise to a critical state  @xcite , i.e. , its dynamics would be driven towards the critical regime by some intrinsic mechanism and not be dependent on external tuning . in support of this view , levina and",
    "colleagues  @xcite showed analytically and numerically that activity - dependent depressive synapses could lead to parameter - independent criticality .",
    "the interpretation that neuronal activity is poised at a critical state appears to be mostly phenomenological whereby an analogy has been developed between the propagation of spikes in a neuronal network and models of percolation dynamics  @xcite or branching processes  @xcite .",
    "remarkable qualitative similarities between the statistical properties of neuronal activity and the above models have given credence to this analogy , however , the question remains as to whether it is justified .",
    "indeed , various key assumptions underlying percolation dynamics and branching processes are typically violated in the neuroscience domain .",
    "for example , full sampling , which is required in order to assess _ self - organised _ criticality , is unattainable even in the most simple _ in vitro _",
    "scenario and yet it has been shown that sub - sampling can have profound effects on the distribution of the resulting observations  @xcite . on a related note , and more generally , the formal definition of a critical system as one operating at , or near , a second order ( continuous ) phase transition is problematic since the concept of phase transition applies to systems with infinite degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "many neuroscience authors address this by appealing to the concept of finite size scaling and many published reports implicitly assume that distributions are power law with truncation to account for the so - called finite size effect .",
    "typically , such reports adopt an approach whereby ( a ) scale invariance is assessed through finite size scaling analysis , confirming that upon rescaling the event size , the curves collapse to a power law with truncation at system size ( but see below regarding the definition of system size ) ; ( b ) the parameters of statistical models are estimated , typically over a range of event size values that are rarely justified ; and ( c ) the best model is determined by model selection , in which power law and exponentially truncated power law are compared to alternatives such as exponential , lognormal and gamma distributions , see  @xcite for a typical example . whilst greater rigour in the statistical treatment of the assessment of the presence of power laws has been attained",
    "following clauset and colleagues influential paper  @xcite , what seems to be lacking is a rigorous treatment as to why a power law should be assumed to begin with .",
    "although this question is particularly pertinent to the neurosciences , it should be noted that similar questions remain open in the field of percolation theory ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , namely : ( i ) how does the critical transition behaviour emerge from the behaviour of large finite systems and what are the features of the transition ?",
    "( ii ) what is the location of the scaling window in which to determine the critical parameters ?",
    "this paper specifically seeks to address the following questions :    1 .   assuming that the whole brain , or indeed a region of interest defined by where data can be obtained , is operating at criticality , can we reasonably expect power law statistics in neural data coming from a very small ( possibly sub - sampled ) subset of the system ? if not , what would be the expected distribution ?",
    "sornette  @xcite states that the gamma distribution is  found in critical phenomena in the presence of a finite size effect or at a finite distance from the critical point \" .",
    "jensen  @xcite claims that finite - size systems often show an exponential cut - off below the system size .",
    "however , we are not aware of any study in which the distribution of event sizes in a finite - size system set to operate at a critical regime has been investigated .",
    "2 .   in a finite - size system , is it reasonable / possible to perform a robust statistical assessment of power law statistics ?",
    "even the application of a rigorous model selection approach will lead to different results depending on the choice of the range of event sizes and the number of samples being considered  @xcite .",
    "the issue of range selection is of particular interest . whilst the notion of system size is clear in models of criticality such as the abelian sandpile where ( i ) there is full sampling , ( ii ) the number of sites is finite , and ( iii ) there is dissipation at the edges ,",
    "system size is much less obvious where re - entrant connections exist , making it possible , in principle , for avalanches to be of infinite size . here ,",
    "the counting measure which leads to the definition of an avalanche is important .",
    "counting the number of neurones involved in an avalanche will lead to a clearly defined system size , whereas counting the total number of activations  the _ de facto _ standard , e.g. ,  @xcite  will not .",
    "furthermore , it should also be noted that the presence of re - entrant connections invalidates the standard theory of branching processes  @xcite , and makes a rigorous determination of the branching parameter @xmath0 problematic if not impossible , e.g. , in the presence of avalanches merging .",
    "3 .   are there other markers of criticality that may be more amenable to characterisation and that should be considered instead of , or in addition to , the statistics of event sizes ? the need for such markers in neuroscience has been recognised ( see  @xcite for example ) and a number of studies have investigated long - range temporal correlations ( power - law decay of the autocorrelation function ) in amplitude fluctuations  @xcite and in inter - burst intervals  @xcite .",
    "however , a theoretical account of how those may relate to one another is lacking ( although see the recent work in  @xcite ) .",
    "other markers of criticality ( or markers of transitions ) have been associated with critical physical systems , e.g. , divergence of susceptibility and slowing of the recovery from perturbations near the critical point  @xcite , however , we are not aware of any theoretical or empirical study investigating them in a neuroscience context .",
    "one way to address these questions more rigorously is to use simplified but therefore more tractable conceptual models ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we use a model of a purely excitatory neuronal system with simple stochastic neuronal dynamics which can be tuned to operate at , or near , a second order phase transition ( specifically , a transcritical bifurcation ) .",
    "the simplicity of the model allows us to analytically calculate the exact distribution of avalanche sizes , which we confirm through simulations of the system s dynamics .",
    "we study our model at the critical point and compare our exact distribution to the explicit but approximate solution proposed by kessler @xcite in an analogous problem of modelling disease dynamics .",
    "we confirm that kessler s approximate solution converges to our exact result .",
    "importantly , we show that , in the proposed finite - size system , this distribution is not a power law , thus highlighting the necessity of considering other markers of criticality .",
    "we thus analyse two potential markers of criticality : ( i ) the divergence of susceptibility that arises in the model as we approach the critical point , ( ii ) the slowing down of the recovery time from small disturbances as the system approaches the critical point .",
    "finally , we speculate on a sufficient but not necessary condition under which our exact distribution could converge to a true power law in the limit of the system size .",
    "we start from the stochastic model of benayoun et al .",
    "@xcite which we simplify to the most trivial of models .",
    "a fully connected network of @xmath1 neurones is considered with purely excitatory connections ( as opposed to the excitatory and inhibitory networks considered in  @xcite ) . within the network ,",
    "neurones are considered to be either quiescent ( q ) or active ( a ) .",
    "taking a small time step @xmath2 and allow @xmath3 the transition probabilities between the two states are then given by : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the input to the neurone . here",
    "@xmath6 is an activation function , @xmath7 is an optional external input , @xmath8 is the connection strength from neurone @xmath9 to neurone @xmath10 and @xmath11 if neurone @xmath10 is active at time @xmath12 and zero otherwise .",
    "@xmath13 is the de - activation rate and therefore controls the refractory period of the neurone .",
    "to allow tractability , we further make the following simplifications :    1 .",
    "we assume that all synaptic weightings are equal ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we assume there is no external input .",
    "the driven case will be explored theoretically and empirically in a companion manuscript .",
    "we assume the linear identity activation function @xmath15 . although it is more common to use sigmoid activation functions we note that the identity function can just be thought of as a suitably scaled @xmath16 function over the desired range .",
    "as the network is fully connected we can write the following mean field equation for active neurones : @xmath17 where we have appealed to the fact that the system is closed and thus @xmath18",
    ". this ode is analogous to the much studied  @xcite susceptible @xmath19 infectious @xmath19 susceptible ( sis ) model used in mathematical epidemiology and we can appeal to some of the known results in studying its behaviour . primarily we can use simple stability analysis .",
    "the non - zero steady state is given by @xmath20 .",
    "setting @xmath21 , this equilibrium point is stable if @xmath22 .",
    "thus @xmath23    borrowing from epidemiology we define the threshold @xmath24 . if @xmath25 we see that @xmath26 and the non - zero steady state is stable .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates the differing behaviour of the solution to the above ode for @xmath27 ( sub - critical ) , @xmath28 ( critical ) and @xmath29 ( super - critical ) .",
    "and three different regimes where @xmath30 was set to @xmath31 ( blue ) , @xmath32 ( green ) and @xmath33 ( red ) .",
    "initially we activated 25% of the network.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]      instead of focussing on the average activity level across the network we will instead look at the size distribution of firing neurones following one firing event . to do this",
    "we begin with a fully quiescent network and initially activate just one neurone .",
    "we then record the total number of neurones that fire ( the number of quiescent to active transitions ) until the network returns to the fully quiescent state .",
    "we use this process of sequential activation as our definition of an avalanche and our main interest is the distribution of the avalanche sizes .",
    "unfortunately , the simple ode approach will not provide us with this distribution . to calculate this distribution",
    ", we use the semi - analytic approach described in the following section .",
    "we begin by defining @xmath34 as the probability the next transition is a recovery ( from a to q ) given @xmath9 active neurones ( @xmath35 ) . the probability the next transition is an activation is then @xmath36 and we have : @xmath37 in order to calculate the avalanche size distribution",
    "we adopt a recursive approach .",
    "we begin by considering the process unfolding in a tree like manner with @xmath38 initially active neurone .",
    "the tree can be divided into levels based on how the process is unfolding .",
    "each level is itself subdivided into two containing the possible number of active neurones before and after a transition has occurred .",
    "level @xmath39 contains firstly the number of active neurones after @xmath40 transitions and secondly all possible active neurones after @xmath41 transitions .",
    "the recursive tree approach relates the probability of transition between and within these levels to the final avalanche size .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] illustrates the first @xmath42 levels of this process .        to continue we",
    "define @xmath43 as the probability of having @xmath9 active neurones on level @xmath39 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 . on the first level ( @xmath46 )",
    "we immediately see that @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . to proceed we will consider the probability of having an odd number of active neurones on an arbitrary level .",
    "first we note the following within level recurrence @xmath50 +   + we can now use these in our calculation of @xmath51 and obtain the following between level recurrence @xmath52    this newly derived recurrence relation provides a consistent set of equations between levels in terms of odd numbers of active neurones .",
    "this algebraic manipulation was necessary to obtain a self - consistent system of equations .",
    "letting @xmath53 we have : @xmath54 where we must make suitable modifications for systems with only an individual neurone active and also near and at full activation . for a single active neurone the equation is simply given as @xmath55 for full ( or near full ) activation the equations depend on the system size , @xmath1 . defining @xmath56",
    "if @xmath1 even and @xmath57 for @xmath1 odd we then obtain @xmath58 +   + we now define : @xmath59 we can now write @xmath60 where , for n even , matrix @xmath61 is given by the following tridiagonal matrix : @xmath62 where @xmath63    on the @xmath64 level of the tree , the probability of only @xmath38 neurone being active is given by @xmath65 .",
    "we can then calculate the probability of zero active neurones after @xmath39 firings as @xmath66 ; this is thus the probability , @xmath67 , of having avalanches of size @xmath68 since initially one neurone is active . to calculate the distribution we implemented the recursive method of calculation in the matlab^^ environment .      in order to check the validity of our method",
    ", we performed simulations of the firing neurones using the gillespie algorithm  @xcite . due to the network being",
    "fully connected the algorithm is relatively straightforward :    * as earlier let @xmath69 be the number of active neurones in the network ( @xmath70 the number of quiescent ) .",

    ". for small avalanche sizes where the number of infectives is negligible compared to the network size the transition probabilities can be approximated as @xmath83 in the critical regime @xmath28 , the problem reduces to calculating the distribution of first passage times of a random walk with equal transition probabilities .",

    ", we employ a subset of the model selection approach described by clauset and colleagues  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we consider @xmath97 of the simulated avalanches described earlier and fit a truncated power law distribution of the form @xmath98 to avalanches up to size @xmath99 ( the choice of this upper bound will be justified in the following section ) by using the maximum likelihood method ( here @xmath100 is a normalising constant to keep the sum of the distribution between @xmath101 $ ] equal to @xmath38 ) .",
    "we do this by finding values of @xmath13 and @xmath102 that maximise the probability of obtaining our simulated avalanches given the fitted distribution .",
    "next we randomly generate @xmath103 data sets from the fitted distribution and compute the difference between these synthetic data sets and the fitted form ( using the kolmogorov - smirnov statistic ) .",
    "similarly we compute the difference between our simulations and the fitted power law .",
    "the p - value is then calculated as the proportion of synthetic data sets that are further away from the theoretical distributions than our simulations . as per  @xcite , the hypothesis ( that the data comes from a power law ) is rejected if the p - value is less than 0.1 .",
    "note that in the model selection approach , should the hypothesis not be rejected , then one should test alternative models and use an information criterion to identify the best model .",
    "however , our focus here is purely on assessing whether our distribution can be said to behave like a power law distribution ( we know it is not actually a power law ) and therefore alternative models were not tested . with @xmath97 avalanches we obtained a p - value of @xmath104 leading us not to reject the hypothesis that the distribution was power law ( see figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "since the distribution is not a power law , we would expect that upon considering a larger number of avalanches , this hypothesis should be rejected  @xcite .",
    "indeed , using data from @xmath105 avalanches yielded a p - value of @xmath75 , i.e. , the truncated power law is not an appropriate model for the distribution .     +    the fact that the truncated power law was a plausible fit for the lesser number of avalanches ( note that @xmath97 is of the same order of magnitude as the number of avalanches typically reported in _ in vitro _ or _ in vivo _ studies of neuronal avalanches ) is indicative of the partial scale - free behaviour the model exhibits .",
    "the appeal of the concept of critical brain is that the critical regime is the one in which long - range correlations keep the system poised between too highly correlated states of no behavioural value and too weakly correlated states that prevent information flow  @xcite .",
    "thus , the actual nature of the distribution of the avalanche size matters less than any indication of the presence of long range correlations . in other words ,",
    "neuronal avalanches need not precisely follow a power law , they just need to exhibit similar behaviour . it is important to appreciate this distinction . as the exact solution to the distribution of avalanche sizes is known , we can then compare it visually with a fit of a truncated power law over avalanche sizes from @xmath106 to @xmath107 .",

    "over the last decade or so , the search for evidence that the brain may be a critical system has been the focus of much research .",
    "this is because it is thought that a critical brain would benefit from maximised dynamic range of processing , fidelity of information transmission and information capacity  @xcite .",
    "whilst support for the critical brain hypothesis has emerged from comparing brain dynamics at various scales with the dynamics of physical systems at criticality ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , in this paper , we focus on the important body of work that has relied on characterising power laws in the distributions of size of neuronal avalanches  @xcite . our focus on this scale",
    "is motivated by empirical considerations regarding how one can go about demonstrating the above functional properties .",
    "shew and plenz  @xcite remark that any research strategy to test whether these properties are optimal near criticality will have to achieve two criteria : a means of altering the overall balance of interactions between neurones and a means of assessing how close to criticality the cortex is operating .",
    "as argued by these authors , the study of neuronal avalanches offers the greatest likelihood of achieving those two criteria .",
    "the importance of a robust assessment of the statistical properties of the avalanche size is therefore two - fold : on the one hand , it is about ascertaining the extent to which the system being studied has the statistical properties expected of a system operating at , or near , criticality ; on the other hand , it is about being able to confirm that a manipulation / perturbation of the system aimed to push the system away from this critical regime has been effective .",
    "this consideration therefore puts a lot of importance on the description of the statistics one should expect in such a system . in the current literature ,",
    "the assumption of the distribution of avalanche sizes taking a power law functional form relies on an analogy between the propagation of spikes in a neuronal network and models of percolation dynamics or branching processes for which exact power laws have been demonstrated _ in the limit of system size_. as a result of the importance of having a robust assessment of the expected presence of a power law , greater emphasis has recently been put on using a sound statistical testing framework , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "whilst we are unaware of any study in which the criticality hypothesis was rejected due to failure of rigorous statistical testing ( which we suspect is due to the necessarily small number of observations , as we will argue below ) , there is clear evidence that many authors are now using the methods of clauset et al .",
    "@xcite to confirm the criticality of their experimental findings , e.g. ,  @xcite . as a result",
    ", we feel that it is all the more important to confirm that the assumed power law functional form is indeed a sensible representation of what one should expect in _ in vivo _ and _ in vitro _ recordings , which , unlike the physical systems considered when deriving the power law statistics , are finite - size systems .",
    "the aim of the paper was therefore to consider a model of neuronal dynamics that would be simple enough to allow the derivation of analytical or semi - analytical results whilst ( i ) giving us a handle on the parameter controlling the fundamental principle thought to underlie criticality in the brain , namely , the _ balancing _ between processes that enhance and suppress activity ( note that we are intentionally not referring to excitation and/or inhibition  we will return to this below ) and ( ii ) allowing us to determine its distribution of avalanche sizes when operating in the critical regime .",
    "note that because we are using a finite - size system , we are appealing to a normal form of standard bifurcation , here , a transcritical bifurcation , because it embodies all that needs to be known about the ` critical ' transition ( sornette , private communication ) .",
    "our semi - analytic derivation of the true distribution of avalanche sizes in a finite - size system suggests that , even though it is approximately scale free over a limited range , the distribution is not a true power law .",
    "first , this has important implications for the interpretation of results from a robust statistical assessment of the distribution . indeed , as has been discussed by klaus and plenz  @xcite , with a large number of samples , any distribution that deviates from the expected distribution by more than noise due to sampling ,",
    "will eventually yield a p - value such that the power law hypothesis will be rejected , thus leading to the potentially incorrect conclusion that the system is not critical .",
    "this is the case in our scenario where using @xmath194 avalanches lead to a rejection of the criticality hypothesis even though the system is tuned to the critical regime . in contrast , with @xmath195 avalanches ( which is consistent with empirical observations ) , a p - value above threshold leads to not rejecting the hypothesis that the distribution is a power law even though we established it is not one .",
    "this finding therefore provides an important counterpart to the analytical results of touboul and colleagues  @xcite who showed that thresholded stochastic processes could generically yield apparent power laws that only stringent statistical testing will reject .",
    "whilst the stringent testing will reject the hypothesis of criticality for a system that is not necessarily critical , it may also reject the hypothesis of criticality for a system that is critical only because the actual distribution is not actually a power law .",
    "this ambiguity of the avalanche distribution in the finite - size system therefore requires that one should carefully consider to what fundamental property the idea of a critical brain actually appeals to .",
    "we suggest that the key appeal is that the brain can exhibit long - range correlations between neurones without it ever experiencing an over saturation of activity or long periods of inactivity .",
    "it then follows that the importance is not in the exact distribution obtained but in the approximately scale - free behaviour it exhibits . in turn , this highlights the importance of looking at other markers of criticality ( which we will discuss below ) .",
    "another important result of this work is to provide the beginning of a mechanistic explanation for an often alluded to ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) but never properly treated ( as far as we are aware ) observation that whereas avalanches in a critical system with re - entrant connections could in principle be arbitrarily long , and certainly , exceeding the number of recording sites , neuronal avalanches in _ in vitro _ or _ in vivo _ systems ( and many computational models of self - organised criticality ) often show a cut - off at the number of sites .",
    "our work suggests that the lead eigenvalue of the transition matrix between states fully determine the location of this cut - off which turns out indeed to be at about the system size , even if avalanches of up to 20 times the system size can be observed .",
    "this finding therefore provides some justification for setting , or accepting , a bound within which to apply a clauset - type methodology ( we note that various reports use different ranges , e.g. , 80% of system size in  @xcite , roughly system size in  @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth remembering that the number of recording sites can have profound implications on the nature of the distribution observed  @xcite .",
    "in addition to providing results on the distribution of avalanche sizes , we also sought to explore other potential markers of criticality .",
    "we provided results on two other markers of criticality  critical slowing down and divergence of susceptibility  both of which again follow from a dynamical systems appreciation of a critical bifurcation , i.e. , the behaviour of a system whose lead eigenvalue crosses zero .",
    "the appeal of those markers , which have been documented in many other natural processes , e.g. ,  @xcite , but seldom at the mesoscopic brain level , see  @xcite for a rare example , is that ( a ) they strengthen the assessment of the system being critical and ( b ) may contribute to achieving the second criterion of shew and plenz  @xcite .",
    "although the authors are not in a position to provide explicit recommendations for an experimental design , we believe that these markers are amenable to robust experimentation , e.g. , through pharmacological manipulation .    whilst we hope we have convinced the reader of the potential importance of these findings , we also need to recognise that the very simplicity that makes analytical work possible does also raise questions regarding how physiologically plausible such a model is and therefore whether its conclusions should be expected to hold .",
    "below , we address a few of the points worthy of further consideration .      in this paper , we have used a purely excitatory neuronal model .",
    "this not only simplifies the system but is also an important characteristic of the brain during early development .",
    "experimental results have shown that during early development , before birth , gabaergic neurones ( i.e. neurones which will later be inhibitory ) have a depolarising effect on their post - synaptic neighbours  @xcite .",
    "thus , our model might be considered as representative of early development .",
    "power law statistics have been observed in early development at a time when networks are thought to be purely excitatory  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that this approach has the benefit of casting a new light on the question of what is the minimum requirement for a neuronal system to show criticality . to a large extent",
    ", the current literature has been focused on a form of homeostasis resulting from either a fine balance between excitation and inhibition , e.g. ,  @xcite or some relatively complex dynamical processes at synaptic level , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "our results show that a purely excitatory system can show the exact same behaviour such that on average each active neurone only activates one postsynaptic neurone . here",
    ", this balanced state is achieved through a trade - off between the rates at which neurones become active and quiescent .",
    "it should be noted that this formulation of the problem leads to interesting parallels with classical models of mathematical epidemiology which the authors intend to continue exploring .      to make use of the analytic tractability of the mean field equation it was necessary to consider a fully connected network .",
    "while this is not true of the whole brain , it _ may _ be closer to the reality of the kind of in vitro systems typically considered in studies of neuronal avalanches .",
    "for example , hellwig et al .",
    "@xcite report up to @xmath196 connection probability in local connectivity between pyramidal neurones in layers 2/3 of the rat visual cortex . extending the work presented here to consider the effect of network topology on the system s dynamics and the resulting distribution of event sizes would be of particular interest from a developmental viewpoint . as networks mature ,",
    "there is not only a switch to inhibition by a proportion of the neurones ( the so - called gaba switch ) , but also a subsequent pruning of synaptic connections   @xcite .",
    "the level of pruning is high , with a @xmath197 reduction in the number of synaptic connections between early childhood and adulthood  @xcite .",
    "thus , a developing network may be more readily approximated by a fully connected network than an adult neural network would be .",
    "the lack of a spatial embedding of our model is in contrast with many classical models of criticality , and also with physiological systems .",
    "accordingly , our model can not display another important marker of criticality , namely , the divergence of correlation lengths in space . a spatial embedding is not needed for our system to be critical and to exhibit a distribution of avalanche size similar to that observed in physiological neuronal avalanches .",
    "it therefore begs the question of the exact role of spatial embedding in the dynamics of neuronal avalanches .",
    "it may well be that , just like balanced activity in our model comes about from a trade - off between excitation and refractoriness rather than between excitation and inhibition , specific spatial embeddings may enable balanced activity without the need for plastic mechanisms .",
    "kaiser and hilgetag  @xcite showed that hierarchical modular networks can lead to limited sustained activity whereby the activity of neural populations in the network persists between the extremes of either quickly dying out or activating the whole network .",
    "roxin and colleagues  @xcite observed self - sustained activity in excitable integrate - and - fire neurones in a small - world network , whose dynamics depends sensitively on the propagation velocity of the excitation .",
    "finally , in this paper , we have focused on the non - driven case @xmath182 . whilst this constraint allowed the derivation of analytical results",
    ", it obviously contrasts with the reality of a physiological system unless one considers that any ` external ' input operates at such a slower timescale that one could assume separation of time scales ( an important assumption in the self - organised criticality framework ) .",
    "however , the fact that binning is required for identifying avalanches in physiological recordings suggests that this separation of time scales is unlikely .",
    "whilst the introduction of a non - zero @xmath198 in our model does not affect the results obtained using finite size expansion , it does effectively make it impossible for the system to operate at @xmath96",
    ". a thorough investigation of the driven case ( @xmath199 ) will be the subject of the companion paper .",
    "for generality we now assume that each neurone receives a constant external input and that the activation function can take forms other than the simple identity function .",
