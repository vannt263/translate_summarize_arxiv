    "it would be clearly an attractive proposition if planets could form in a way similar to stars , e.g. , by gravitational contraction followed by a rapid collapse of gas or solid material clumps .",
    "a clear route to this is gravitational instability ( gi ) of the parent protoplanetary disc , when the latter fragments onto gaseous clumps with masses of a few jupiter mass ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "@xcite argued that giant planets may form this way .",
    "however giant planets in the solar system contain massive solid cores , and they are also much more metal rich than the sun .",
    "thus a simple gravitational collapse of a giant planet embryo could not work .",
    "@xcite suggested that solid cores of the order of a few earth masses ( @xmath3 ) can be formed if dust grows and sediments inside the giant embryos .",
    "@xcite further suggested that even more massive and icy cores can be built inside giant proto - planets at 10 to a few tens of au distances .",
    "these authors further pointed out that metalicity of such planets could be raised if gas envelopes of giant planet embryos are removed by photo - evaporation due to a nearby ob star .",
    "such a model would account for both the solid cores and high metalicities of the giant planets .",
    "however , @xcite argued that giant planet embryos may become convective within the first @xmath4 years of their evolution , and that convection may inhibit grain sedimentation .",
    "@xcite have recently confirmed this , obtaining much smaller solid cores than the model of @xcite predicts .",
    "these authors also found that their model gas clumps either were too hot to begin with or became hot too soon for a significant dust growth , instead vaporising the grains .",
    "another objection to the gravitational instability model for planet formation was pointed out by @xcite who showed analytically that the disc can not even fragment on self - bound gas clumps inside @xmath5 au at least . the core accretion ( ca ) model for planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) therefore seems more attractive to many .",
    "however , the extrasolar planets observed at large ( @xmath6 au ) separations from their parent stars @xcite can not be explained by the ca model due to exceedingly long core formation times .",
    "these planets were almost certainly formed by the gravitational disc instability ( e.g. , see simulations by * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "formation by gi is not absolutely forbidden even for the giant planets observed inside a few au disc .",
    "true , the planets could not have started to form in situ there because initially giant embryos are much less dense than the local tidal density ( see  2 below ) . however , radial migration of massive planets @xcite due to planet - disc torques is now an accepted ingredient of any planet formation theory , and provides an attractive explanation for the observed distribution of extrasolar planets in the radial range of @xmath7 au @xcite , and `` hot jupiters '' even closer in .",
    "we do not see why it is not possible for the giant planets to form at very large radii by gi and then migrate inwards to a few au if they contract quickly enough . in a companion paper ( nayakshin 2010b ; submitted to mnras , referred below as paper iii )",
    "we argue that such a long - range migration is possible in the very early phase of formation of the parent star , when the disc mass is comparable to that of the star .",
    "furthermore , boss et al , wuchterl et al , and helled and co - authors all considered embryos with gas densities of order @xmath8 g @xmath9 ( perhaps having in mind the tidal density constraints for jupiter at @xmath10 5 au ) .",
    "nayakshin ( 2010a , `` paper i '' ) showed the disc fragmentation constrains @xcite require that the initial density of gas clumps formed at @xmath4 au from the star is around @xmath11 g @xmath9 .",
    "this fluffy initial state of giant embryos is also much cooler , with typical temperatures of only @xmath4 k , an order of magnitude lower than in the study by helled an co - authors .",
    "it is thus not surprising that we found in paper i such embryos to be much more promising sites of grain growth and sedimentation than did @xcite . for reasonable opacity values",
    ", dust grows and sediments inside isolated giant planet embryos with masses between a few and @xmath12 jupiter masses most readily .",
    "since the embryos are approximately isentropic at birth , convection did not appear to be important in opposing grain sedimentation .    for technical reasons ,",
    "the calculations were stopped in paper i when the grain density in the inner region of the gas clump reached that of the gas . in this paper",
    "we extend the calculations similar to those presented in paper i to later times . as predicted analytically in paper i",
    ", the inner region becomes completely grain - dominated by mass and then undergoes a rapid collapse .",
    "the gas component is `` protected '' against the collapse by the pressure gradient , and thus the two phases separate at the cloud centre .",
    "the grains form a high density `` solid'' core ( it is most likely melted or even liquid given the high energy release , but we shall still refer to it as a solid core as it may solidify later on when it cools ) .",
    "our main results can be summarised as following :    * the heat generated by the rapid assembly of the high - z core produces a negative feedback on the core s growth .",
    "grains can be melted , driven away convectively or by a bulk gas expansion , cutting off further core growth .",
    "thus , concerning the final mass of the solid cores , our results are less optimistic than that of @xcite , but more optimistic than that of @xcite . continuing the trends from paper i , the embryos of a few to ten jupiter masses usually yield the heaviest solid cores .",
    "more massive giant embryos are hotter to begin with and hence reach the grain vaporisation temperature sooner .",
    "* gas immediately adjacent to the solid core is strongly influenced by the energy release due to the core s assembly .",
    "strong convection sets in ( thus confirming its importance but only after the core formation ) , frequently supplemented by an outward gas expansion .",
    "* resolving the region near the solid core is challenging numerically , which implies that we probably underestimate the degree to which the gas becomes bound to the core .",
    "even so , in a simulation where most of the giant embryo gets unbound , the solid core is left with a gas atmosphere of @xmath13 .",
    "this shows that solid cores bred inside giant embryos may attract a gaseous atmosphere from within the embryo .",
    "this atmosphere is metal rich . *",
    "we then use analytical arguments and a physical analogy to the classical results from the core accretion model for giant planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we suggest that as the solid core mass increases above @xmath14 , a runaway gas accretion sets in , in which the gas envelope collapses on itself .",
    "the resulting solid core plus a metal - rich self - bound atmosphere should be similar to a giant planet . * in one of the simulations presented below most of the gas envelope gets unbound by the energy release from the core .",
    "this shows that , at least in the high optical depth cases , the heat released by the core s accretion may remove the envelope without an outside help .",
    "we believe that this outer layers blowout process may be even more prominent ( e.g. , likely ) when the massive atmosphere collapse occurs , as that may release even more energy .",
    "* we suggest that the outer metal - poor layers of the giant embryo could also be removed by physical collisions of embryos . *",
    "we find that the protective giant embryo environment strongly diminishes the role of turbulence .",
    "we show that turbulent gas velocities would have to be as large as 0.3 times the sound speed to prevent gravitational collapse of the `` grain sphere '' into the solid core .",
    "as these high speeds are unlikely , we argue that solid cores can be built by a direct gravitational collapse inside the giant envelopes _ without _ having to go through the intermediate step of planetesimals .",
    "the planetesimals are thus not building blocks of planets in this picture .",
    "they are the material that did not join the core .",
    "* thus , in contrast to the classical planetesimal core assembly route ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we would expect a far smaller fraction of the solid mass to be locked into intermediate ( e.g. , a km ) size bodies . *",
    "the main building blocks of solid cores in our scenario are pebble sized grains ( e.g. , @xmath15 cm )",
    ". grains of this size sediment efficiently enough and yet slowly enough as to avoid shattering in high speed collisions . *",
    "concluding , our key point is that the combination of dust sedimentation , solid core accretion and gas envelope collapse , on the one hand , with the removal of the outer metal - poor envelope of the embryo on the other , may result in terrestrial planet embryos , terrestrial planets , or giant planets , depending on when the envelope removal occurs .    in the follow - up paper already mentioned above ( paper iii ) , we argue that removal of the giant embryo by tidal shear from the star helped by heating caused by irradiation is un - escapable for giant planets migrating closer in than a few to a few ten au .",
    "an exception to this could be a more massive giant planet @xmath16 that could undergo the `` second collapse '' @xcite before it is disrupted .",
    "such massive planets should have metalicities close to that of their parent stars .",
    "a hybrid regime of planet formation is possible , in which the solid cores are hatched inside the giant planet embryos , delivered into the inner disc and left there when the embryos are disrupted .",
    "these solid cores may continue their growth by accumulation of solid material from the disc ( rather than the parent embryo ) in direct impacts , and then accrete massive gaseous envelopes from the surrounding gas disc , resulting in gas giant planets . in this case",
    "the beginning phase of planet formation is as in the modified gi hypothesis we study , but continuation as in the core accretion theory .",
    "future detailed calculations and comparison to observations are needed to test feasibility of these ideas . in any event",
    "it seems very clear that the gravitational instability model for planet formation has been discounted by most authors without a proper critical review of all the evidence .",
    "in paper i we argued that the properties of the giant planet embryos formed by gravitational instability in the disc at their inception should be similar to that of the first cores of same mass .",
    "the key properties of first cores , taken from the results of @xcite as explained in paper i , are briefly reproduced here for reader s convenience .",
    "the opacity law is taken in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the opacity at @xmath19 k , and reasonable values of @xmath20 are thought to be between 1 and 2 .",
    "for simplicity , in this paper we only consider the @xmath21 case (  [ sec : fiducial ] ) .",
    "the initial radius of the first core is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24k is the initial gas temperature , e.g. , the temperature of the parent gas material ( the disc or the molecular cloud ) .",
    "finally , @xmath25 .",
    "the mean density of the first core is defined by @xmath26 the mean temperature of the first core is estimated as @xmath27 the cooling time of the first core is found to be @xmath28 note that the cooling time becomes longer with time , as the gas clump contracts and becomes optically thicker ( paper i ) .      the calculations in paper i were done under the assumption that the first core gains or looses no mass from the surroundings .",
    "this limit applies if the mass exchange rate satisfies ( for @xmath21 ) @xmath29 yr@xmath30 , which does depend on parameters of the first core ( see paper i ) .",
    "we shall continue to assume this in the present paper as well , and hence the mass of the embryo is a free parameter of our calculations .",
    "it was shown in paper i that grain sedimentation timescales can be shorter than the `` vaporisation time '' , @xmath31 , which is the time needed for the first core to heat up to the grain vaporisation temperature of about 1400 k. the calculations were stopped when the density of the dust was equal to that of the gas in the inner part of the cloud .",
    "continuation of the calculations leads to the dust density increasing even further , and then a gravitational collapse .",
    "this then requires a treatment for the solid core forming in the innermost part of the gas cloud . before we present calculations that now include formation of the cores , we first discuss the order of magnitude of physical characteristics of the solid cores .",
    "the first question to ask about the solid cores built inside isolated first cores is how massive they could be .",
    "the total mass of `` high - z '' elements , e.g. , those excluding hydrogen and helium , is about @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the metal mass fraction ( 0.02 for gas of solar metalicity ) .",
    "this mass includes ices and organics that are probably too volatile to contribute to the solid core , as the surrounding gas temperature is typically around 1000 k. the mass of refractory material ( e.g. , silicates ) that can be used to build a massive core is hence expected to be about @xmath34 of the total heavy elements mass .",
    "therefore , the maximum mass of the solid core that can be built inside an _ isolated _ first core is @xmath35 the minimum core mass ( same as the opacity fragmentation limit * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a few jupiter masses , and the maximum mass that permits grain sedimentation is typically a few tens of @xmath36 .",
    "accordingly , the total mass of useful core - building material is expected to be in the range of @xmath37 to @xmath38 or so earth s masses .",
    "these estimates should be tripled if the embryo is cool enough to permit formation of ices .",
    "we expect the core of high - z elements to have a density of the order of the terrestrial planet densities , e.g. , @xmath39 a few g @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding radial size of the solid core , @xmath40 , is in the range of @xmath41 to a few times @xmath42 cm , which is about 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the size of the first core .",
    "the binding energy of the solid core is @xmath43 the binding energy of the first core at formation is in the rough range of @xmath44 to @xmath45 erg ( see paper i ) , and it increases in proportion to the virial temperature of the core ( dimensionless @xmath46 introduced in paper i ) as the core contracts . hence a massive enough solid core , @xmath47 , may release an amount of energy comparable to the binding energy of the core itself , strongly affecting the core .",
    "furthermore , for a constant density gas sphere , inside the embryo , the binding energy scales as @xmath48 , and the thermal energy scales as @xmath49 . thus building up a massive solid core is very likely to heat up the gas at least in the inner parts of the first core .",
    "we use the same set up , equations and numerical techniques as in paper i , adding to the code several new features to describe the evolution of the solid core and its effects on the surrounding gas . in brief , spherically symmetric lagrangian coordinates are used .",
    "a cell is defined by its fixed gas mass , whereas the radial position of the shell changes as the gas contracts or expands .",
    "the equations are those widely used in stellar evolution calculations , except we employ a time - dependent approach that does not assume the hydrostatic or the energy balances for the gas .",
    "we find that this time - dependent approach is very important for the problem at hand .",
    "both the grain and the gas distributions may evolve very rapidly when a heavy - z core is formed via a rapid ( and hence quite luminous ) accretion of grains .",
    "the grains are described as a second fluid that is under the influence of gravity and gas drag .",
    "grains are allowed to slip through the gas , e.g. , from one gas radial shell into the neighbouring one .",
    "for example , grains can move from an outer into an inner radial shell when they sediment , or be carried in the opposite direction by turbulent or convective mixing .",
    "the transport of energy is primarily due to the classical radiation diffusion flux , although convective flux does become important during certain stages of the evolution , e.g. , when the liquid core s luminosity is high .",
    "the mixing length theory for convection is used ( e.g. ,  7 in * ? ? ?",
    "we impose an upper limit to the convective flux , @xmath50 , given by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the gas sound speed and pressure , respectively .",
    "in contrast to paper i , the convective motions of the gas are allowed to contribute to mixing of grains , impeding grain sedimentation . treating this process as a diffusion process , similar to the turbulent mixing ( paper i and * ? ? ? * ) , we `` add '' the convective mixing to turbulent mixing by increasing the turbulent mixing coefficient @xmath54 introduced in paper i : @xmath55 this prescription is motivated by the fact that the convective mixing length by definition becomes about equal to the gas pressure scale - height , e.g. , the radius of the first core , @xmath56 , when @xmath57 .",
    "note that the maximum of @xmath58 .",
    "strong convective motions could therefore be quite important in opposing and perhaps even reversing grain sedimentation , but we find that this fortuitously occurs `` too late '' , when a massive solid core has already formed ( see  [ sec:10mj ] below for an example ) .      like previous authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we found it very challenging numerically to resolve the radial scales of the heavy - z core for the entire duration of the simulations .",
    "as there is very little gas mass on these scales , except if and when a massive gas atmosphere builds up , many more radial shells are needed .",
    "these shells require tiny time steps despite being not very interesting for most of the calculation .",
    "therefore , due to numerical constrains , the length scales that we do resolve for most of the simulations are still large compared with the solid core , of the order of @xmath59 cm .",
    "note that a snapshot re - simulation can of course be done at a higher resolution if one is interested in the small scale structure .",
    "given that the smallest scales are not properly resolved , there is an uncertainty in choosing the boundary conditions for grains at @xmath60 radius , that is in the very first _ gas _ mass zone . in paper",
    "i we assumed that the grains in the innermost zone are suspended by turbulent mixing _ until _ the grain density in the zone exceeded that of the gas .",
    "presumably the inverse drag effects imposed by grains on the gas stifle the turbulence once the grains dominate the gas by mass .",
    "we stopped the simulations at that moment in paper i , delaying a study of core accretion to this paper .",
    "there is no a priory reason why turbulent mixing must be effective at @xmath61 .",
    "if it vanishes in that region , then grains may start to sediment into a high - z core even before they overwhelm the gas by mass in the first zone .",
    "@xcite classified a similar approach as `` case 1 '' , whereas not introducing a solid core until the grains dominate the central zone is is analogous to their case 2 .",
    "however , numerical experiments that we did showed that the difference in results between these two cases is minor for most of the interesting parameter space .",
    "namely , we found that before the first zone is dominated by grains , the high - z core grows very slowly in `` case 1 '' anyway .",
    "this is due to two factors .",
    "first of all , the grain density in the central zone is small during these `` early '' times .",
    "secondly , the grains are themselves small , yielding a rather small sedimentation rate .    in the simulations we explored",
    ", there is a period of a very rapid ( but limited ) growth of the solid core in both case 1 and 2 .",
    "the only significant difference arises for rapidly contracting first cores that reach grain vaporisation temperatures before the rapid high - z core growth phase . in case 1 , a small high - z core",
    "may be built , whereas it is completely absent in case 2 .",
    "we shall keep this fact in mind , and proceed to use only the case 1 in this paper , since it turned out to be numerically more stable during the episodes of the rapid high - z core growth .",
    "this does not lead to any loss of generality of our results .",
    "we still cover the appropriate parameter space of the problem while avoiding presentation of minor differences from very similar runs .",
    "therefore , our prescription for the core accretion rate is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the mass of the dust in the first gas zone , @xmath64 is the outer radius of the first gas zone , and @xmath65 is the velocity with which grains arrive into the first zone from the second gas zone . for simplicity , we assume that the core has the same material density as the grains , @xmath66 . therefore , the outer radius of the core is @xmath67 .",
    "this radius becomes the new inner boundary for the gas : as the core builds up , the inner radius of the first lagrangian mass zone becomes @xmath68 .",
    "as the radius of the heavy elements core is initially orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath69 this does not lead to any significant perturbations for the gas .",
    "accretion of grains onto the surface of the solid core generates accretion luminosity equal to @xmath70 the radiative flux boundary condition is modified from the zero flux one used in paper i , to read @xmath71      the outcome of our grain sedimentation calculations depend on many parameters , such as : the initial grain size @xmath72 ; grain mass fraction relative to gas , @xmath73 ; turbulent mixing coefficient @xmath54 ; maximum velocity @xmath74 for grain growth ; the opacity power law index @xmath20 ; the opacity coefficient @xmath75 ; the mass of the first core , @xmath76 ; and the initial ( same as ambient ) gas temperature @xmath77 .",
    "the parameter space is too large to explore completely in one paper .",
    "fortunately , we find that some of the parameters listed above change the end results very little except near regions delineating critical behaviour changes .",
    "for example , the initial grain size is irrelevant in most cases as small grains grow very quickly in our prescription due to brownian motions .",
    "grains also evaporate very quickly once gas temperature exceeds @xmath78 k , and so their size is not crucial in this case as well .",
    "only when the other parameters of the problems are such that the grain growth time , @xmath79 , is about the vaporisation time , @xmath31 ( see paper i ) , the exact initial value of @xmath72 is important .",
    "we also find that there is a degeneracy in the role of some of the parameters .",
    "as the interior temperatures of the first cores are typically of order of 1000 k , the typical opacity of the first core is @xmath80 . a larger value of @xmath20 can be compensated for by a smaller value of @xmath75 to yield a similar opacity through the first core , although there may still be important differences between these cases near the high - z core or on the outskirts of the first core .",
    "we shall therefore fix some of the less influential parameters at `` reasonable '' values , motivated by observations whenever possible , and also try to avoid model degeneracies . in line with this , we set @xmath33 , @xmath81 k , @xmath82 , @xmath83 cm , @xmath84 m s@xmath30 . a logarithmic gas mass grid is used , so that the mass of grid cell increases with index @xmath85 as @xmath86 , where @xmath87 .",
    "we used @xmath88 cells for most of the runs below , which results in the mass of the innermost gas cell of @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "this leaves three parameters that we found to be instrumental in determining the outcome of the calculations , and we shall vary these in a relatively broad range : the opacity coefficient @xmath75 , the mass of the first core , @xmath76 , and the turbulent mixing coefficient , @xmath54 .      the parameters of the simulations selected for presentation in this paper , and some of the more important results of these simulations are listed in table 1 .",
    "the first column is the simulation `` i d '' , which starts with a letter m , h or l. these stand to indicate the mass of the first core : `` h '' for heavy , @xmath91 ; `` m '' for medium , @xmath90 ; and `` l '' for light , @xmath92 .",
    "the digit next to the first letter refers to the opacity coefficient @xmath75 of the simulation , such that @xmath93 satisfies @xmath94 .",
    "for example , @xmath95 will have @xmath96 in its i d .",
    "similarly , the symbol @xmath20 followed by a digit @xmath97 signifies the magnitude of the turbulent viscosity coefficient , @xmath54 , so that @xmath98 .    the results part of table 1 starts with two columns for two time variables , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , both in units of @xmath101 years .",
    "the former is the duration of the simulation .",
    "the simulations were run for as long as there were an appreciable change in the results or until the simulations stalled due to a vanishingly small time step .",
    "the latter time entry , @xmath102 , is the time of the `` runaway solid core accretion phase '' .",
    "the `` - '' symbol in this column indicates that the simulation never entered this phase because grains vaporised earlier than they sedimented .",
    "the `` na '' ( not applicable ) entry refers to the cases when the core accretion is very gradual , so that no runaway phase can be defined .",
    "this happens when turbulent mixing is significant .",
    "the last three columns in the table relate to the masses of the first cores in units of earth masses .",
    "@xmath103 is the final mass of the core , while @xmath104 and @xmath105 are its masses at two intermediate times , @xmath106 and @xmath107 years , respectively .",
    "these two masses are given to indicate the speed with which the cores are assembled .",
    "here we present several calculations for first cores with mass of @xmath109 .",
    "ids of these runs start with letter `` m '' in table 1 .",
    "we shall first look at several tests with the same level of turbulent mixing parameter , @xmath110 , labelled @xmath203 in table 1 .",
    "we start with a relatively high opacity case , @xmath111 . at the typical first core s interior s temperature",
    ", we have @xmath112 for this particular choice of @xmath75 .",
    "this is quite high but may well be reasonable at least in the innermost parts of the first core when dust sediments there .",
    "figure [ fig : hist_largek ] shows the evolution of several key quantities as a function of time for this calculation .",
    "the solid and dotted curves in the upper panel of the figure show the grain size , @xmath113 , and central gas density , @xmath114 , in units of @xmath115 g @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the dashed curve is the central gas temperature in units of 100 k. the solid curve in the lower panel shows the mass of the high - z core in units of earth s mass , whereas the dotted and the dashed curves show the core s luminosity ( in @xmath116 erg s@xmath30 ) and accretion rate , in @xmath117 yr@xmath30 .",
    "the first @xmath118 yrs of the simulation are familiar from paper i. the grains must grow to @xmath15 cm size before a significant dust sedimentation takes place . the evolution after that is marked by two stages : the `` runaway '' stage during which the high - z core grows very rapidly , almost vertically in figure [ fig : hist_largek ] , and the saturated growth stage when the accretion rate , core s luminosity and grain size all drop with time .",
    "this second stage is a testament to importance of feedback effects during the core s growth .",
    "this can be deduced by noting the abrupt central temperature increase at the end of the `` runaway phase '' , when both the high - z core mass and luminosity increase sharply , and the corresponding central gas density decrease .",
    "the temperature increase disrupts the hydrostatic balance in the central regions , causing an outward gas expansion .",
    "these effects are seen in figure [ fig : sed_largek ] that presents the radial structure of the first core and the grain density distribution during and just after the end of the runaway core growth phase .",
    "the panels show the gas and the grain densities , the gas temperature , the radiative ( black curves ) and the convective luminosities ( blue curves ) , and the gas ( black ) and the grain ( red ) radial velocities .",
    "the convective luminosity is defined by @xmath119 .",
    "the first snapshot in figure [ fig : sed_largek ] , shown with the solid curves , corresponds to the time when the grain density in the inner region is equal to that of the gas , which corresponds to when we stopped the simulations in paper i. the mass of the high - z core is only @xmath120 at that point . as the grain density overtakes the gas density ,",
    "the gas drag and turbulent mixing resistance to grain sedimentation rapidly weaken .",
    "this is seen in the inner part of the radial velocity curves sequence . as the inner part of the `` grain sphere '' contracts due to its own self - gravity , the accretion rate onto the high - z core increases by orders of magnitude .",
    "the luminosity of the solid core shoots up to about a tenth of that produced by the whole first core ( see the dashed and the dot - dashed curves in the upper right panel of the figure ) .",
    "the heat produced by the build up of the high - z core strongly affects the inner region of the cloud , heating up the gas there .",
    "the increased gas pressure initiates a rarefaction wave that moves gas outward , as can be seen in both the density and the velocity curves .",
    "it is likely that the grain sedimentation would continue at this stage if it were not for the gas entropy profile becoming strongly unstable to convection .",
    "the convective flux builds up to its maximum @xmath121 value allowed ( blue curves in the upper right panel ) in the inner part of the cloud .",
    "strong convective mixing drives some grains in the inner region outwards ( see the red velocity curves for grains ) .",
    "note a very good correlation in the positions of the peak of gain velocity curves in the inner part of the embryo with the maximum in the convection luminosity .",
    "this confirms that the outward motion of grains is driven by convection in this region .",
    "the second , also quite important way in which the high - z core growth self - regulates is vaporisation of grains .",
    "as the inner region of the computational domain heats up , grain growth and evaporation start to compete with each other .",
    "in fact the grain size decreases with time ( upper panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist_largek ] ) , although not particularly rapidly in this simulation .",
    "the existence of the two ways in which the high - z cores can affect their surroundings and hence limit the rate of their own growth suggests that this feedback loop is quite robust qualitatively , despite quantitatively depending on details of the gas - grain interaction prescriptions and the parameter values .",
    "these feedback effects preclude incorporation of all of the available condensible material in the high - z core . indeed , as much as @xmath122 of such material is present in the first core , but only a quarter of it gets locked into the high - z core . clearly",
    "this result must be sensitive to the opacity of the first core , as lower opacity would allow more heat to escape the gas cloud , perhaps reducing the feedback effects .",
    "we now present calculation m2@xmath203 which is identical to m1@xmath203 except the opacity is reduced to @xmath95 . the resulting evolution of the first core and the grain distribution is shown in figure [ fig : hist_medk ] . confirming the earlier made claim that embryo opacity is a key parameter of the problem , the resulting change in the dust sedimentation outcome is significant . as the cooling time of the first core decreases as @xmath75 decreases , the cloud contracts more rapidly .",
    "higher gas density promotes faster grain growth .",
    "therefore , grains increase in size and sediment sooner in m2@xmath203 than they did in simulation m1@xmath203 .",
    "the runaway accretion phase begins earlier , at around @xmath123 years . as the core accretion rate is higher , the feedback effects of the growing high - z core are more pronounced , and hence the rapid growth of the core saturates at a lower core mass , and a lower luminosity ( cf .",
    "the lower panels of figures [ fig : hist_largek ] and [ fig : hist_medk ] ) . as in simulation m1@xmath203 , the gas temperature near the core is above vaporisation temperature for the grains , causing grain melting and hence a plunge in the value of @xmath113 at the peak of the runaway growth phase . in comparison to m1@xmath203 ,",
    "reduced opacity enables the gas near the core to transfer the heat outward more rapidly .",
    "this allows a further density and temperature increase near the core , evaporating the grains further .",
    "a complete grain evaporation occurs at about 3,500 years in this calculation .",
    "grain accretion onto the high - z core then ceases , allowing the gas near the core to cool slightly .",
    "the contraction and the respective heating of the gas near the core continues .",
    "this stops any further core re - growth .",
    "the final mass of the high - z core in this simulation is @xmath124 .",
    "the fact that it so close to the earth s mass is of course a complete coincidence .",
    "degrading the numerical resolution from @xmath88 to @xmath125 , and repeating the simulation m2@xmath203 leads to qualitatively very similar results but the final core mass is @xmath126 .",
    "this implies that higher numerical resolution calculations would yield somewhat lower masses for the final @xmath103 , but probably not by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "this is acceptable to us given large uncertainties in parameter values .",
    "the decrease in the final core mass with an increasing resolution is probably due to feedback effects becoming even more pronounced as regions closer and closer to the core are resolved .",
    "we shall investigate these issues further in the future .",
    "figure [ fig : sed_medk ] shows the radial structure of the first cores at and immediately after the runaway accretion phase for the simulation m2@xmath203 .",
    "there are many features similar to those seen earlier in figure [ fig : sed_largek ] .",
    "note a slightly lower core luminosity , which is in line with the lower final core mass .",
    "it is also interesting that the general grain sedimentation trend is reversed at `` large '' r , @xmath127 cm , as grains there start to move outwards ( see the lower right panel in figure [ fig : sed_medk ] ) .",
    "this is caused by a rapid decrease ( by a factor of two ) in the grain size at the runaway accretion phase .",
    "the reduced size of grains implies a smaller sedimentation velocity , and sedimentation is apparently overpowered by turbulent mixing at these radii .",
    "the effect however does not last for long as grains re - grow and sedimentation continues .",
    "simulation m3@xmath203 probes the case of a yet smaller opacity , @xmath128 .",
    "the cooling time of the first core in this case is very short .",
    "therefore , the results of this test are `` uninteresting ''  grains grow to @xmath129 cm only to be evaporated at about @xmath130 years .",
    "we present no figures for this calculation . shortly after the grains",
    "evaporate , the gas temperature approaches 2000 k , and the first core should undergo the second collapse @xcite and probably form a giant planet mass object without a solid core .",
    "simulation m0@xmath203 is the highest opacity case we consider here , with @xmath131 .",
    "as the cooling time is very long for this simulation , the first core does not contract very much before the grains sediment into the high - z core .",
    "the central density of the first core is much smaller than in the previously investigated cases , and for this reason it is plotted in units of @xmath132 g @xmath9 in figure [ fig : histk1 ] .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the simulation m0@xmath203 is very different from the lower opacity cases studied so far .",
    "the central temperature of the first core in m0@xmath203 never becomes high enough to evaporate the grains , except at the very end of the simulation .",
    "this is why the grain size ( solid curve in the upper panel of figure [ fig : histk1 ] ) and the accretion rate onto the solid core ( red dashed curve in the lower panel of the figure ) keep increasing through and after the runaway accretion phase , whereas in m1@xmath203 and m2@xmath203 these quantities peaked during the runaway phase and subsequently dropped with time .    due to lower gas temperatures , the melting type of feedback does not take place in m0@xmath203 before @xmath133 yrs .",
    "grains continue to sediment and build up the central solid core at an increasing rate .",
    "the heat released by the core is trapped near the core due to a higher opacity of the embryo . the only way for the gas in the inner part of the first core to absorb the energy released by the high - z core is to put it into a kinetic form .",
    "this drives a strong outward expansion .",
    "figure [ fig : sed_hugeka ] shows the radial structure of the first core near the beginning of the high - z core runaway accretion phase ( solid curves ) at @xmath134 yrs , and at a later time , @xmath135 yrs ( dotted curves ) .",
    "note an immense change in the luminosity curves ( upper right panel of the figure ) . while initially heat production was all due to the compressional heating of the gas , at later times the energy production is dominated by the grain accretion onto the high - z core .",
    "the innermost region of the gas becomes unstable to convection , and the convection flux then increases to the maximum sonic value that we impose (  [ sec : convection ] ) . at the same time",
    ", the convection flux is still very small compared with the radiative flux .",
    "the increased luminosity of the high - z core also forces the inner regions of the gas to become much hotter , although not as hot as to evaporate the grains ( see the lower left panel of figure [ fig : sed_hugeka ] ) .",
    "the rarefaction in the inner @xmath136 cm of the first core is significant , e.g. , gas density decreases by a factor of a few .",
    "note that the motion of the gas and the increased convective grain mixing does cause some outward radial motion of the grains , although the innermost grain - dominated region becomes depleted mainly due to grain accretion onto the high - z core ( see the red curves in the upper left panel of the figure ) .",
    "further evolution of the first core is marked by a continuing energy release from the solid core , which continues to inflate the hot bubble within the first core until it actually breaks out ",
    "unbinds most of the gas in the outer parts of the first core .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fig : sed_hugek ] , which presents the radial structure at time @xmath137 yrs .",
    "note the very high temperature and density at small radii and , on the contrary , very low densities and a fixed temperature of @xmath138 k at large radii .",
    "the latter is the minimum temperature imposed at the outer boundary for this simulation ( and for most others ; normally this plays no role at all as the temperature of the outermost zone is usually higher than 20 k ) .",
    "the radial structure of the gaseous part of the first core in figure [ fig : sed_hugek ] can be divided into three parts : ( i ) the dense and hot envelope tightly bound to the high - z core ; ( ii ) the intermediate region at @xmath139 cm ; and ( iii ) the outer isothermal expanding shell .",
    "the last part of the fist core is the most massive one ; it is completely unbound and is lost to the environment .",
    "on the other hand , the region near the high - z core can be called its atmosphere as it is apparently bound to the core .",
    "it is likely that the removal of the outer massive shell of gas actually promoted formation of the atmosphere by letting the heat escape the inner region more easily .",
    "the atmosphere is not massive at all : the upper left panel of figure [ fig : sed_hugek ] shows that it is around @xmath13 , compared with the mass of the core , @xmath140 .",
    "nevertheless , it is important as it indicates that the solid cores formed inside the first cores can actually build up gaseous atmospheres if right conditions exist .",
    "we found that the models can be surprisingly and non - monotonically sensitive to the turbulent mixing parameter @xmath54 .",
    "simulations m2@xmath202 and m2@xmath204 are identical to m2@xmath203 except that @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "the evolution of the first core properties of simulation m2@xmath202 and m2@xmath204 is plotted in figure [ fig : hist_medkd2 ] , the left and the right panels , respectively .",
    "concentrating first on m2@xmath202 , we observe that its outcome is drastically different from that seen in figure [ fig : hist_medk ] . the larger turbulent mixing delays grain sedimentation by only about 50% ( see @xmath100 in table 1 ) , but the gas in the first core is hotter by this time .",
    "importantly , the gas temperature is now closer to the vaporisation temperature .",
    "as is clear from the upper panel of figure [ fig : hist_medkd2]a , accretion luminosity of high - z core is only @xmath143 erg s@xmath30 , butthis is sufficient to push the gas near the core over the vaporisation temperature threshold .",
    "the grains evaporate rapidly soon after this , and a further growth of the high - z core turns out impossible . the final mass of the core is @xmath144 .",
    "note also that the accretion rate of grains on to the high - z core is smaller in m2@xmath202 .    [",
