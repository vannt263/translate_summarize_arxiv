    "it is well known that physical network coding ( pnc ) can significantly enhance the throughput in networks compared to the conventional network coding scheme @xcite . in pnc",
    ", the relay can employ the interference as useful information and hence decode the network - coded information ( xor information ) rather than decode the separated information of the two sources .",
    "inspired by such advantages , the pnc has been introduced for many wireless communication systems , e.g. , ultra - wideband ( uwb ) communication systems @xcite .    to obtain more performance enhancement ,",
    "a wealth of research has investigated on the interplay between pnc and other spatial diversity techniques @xcite , such as multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) and space - time block coding ( stbc ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite and @xcite have proposed the precoding scheme respectively for the mimo - pnc system and the stbc - pnc system before transmission to facilitate the pnc operation at the relay .    in recent years ,",
    "joint channel - and - pnc ( jcnc ) schemes have been carefully studied for different channel conditions , e.g. non - fading @xcite and fading scenarios @xcite .",
    "assuming that the same channel code is employed by the two sources , the xor codeword at the relay can be decoded using the modified iterative decoding algorithm @xcite . to further perform the analysis on such a decoder in the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channels ,",
    "@xcite has proposed a new method to model the extrinsic information transfer ( exit ) chart of jcnc .    however , to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is little research in the literature considering the performance of the stbc - based jcnc ( i.e. , stbc - jcnc ) systems . in this paper",
    ", we provide insightful study of a stbc - jcnc system in fading scenarios , where the protograph code is used as the channel code .",
    "it was pointed out that fading statistics in wireless communications are more suitably to be described by a nakagami distribution @xcite .",
    "specially , the distribution of the small - scale amplitudes of ieee 802.15.4a uwb channel models @xcite is modeled as nakagami .",
    "based on the aforementioned observation , the presently proposed system will be investigated over fading channels subjected to nakagami distribution .",
    "assuming that the reciprocal channel state information ( csi ) is available at the two sources , we design a novel precoding scheme at the sources such that the relay can decode the xor codeword more efficiently .",
    "we also propose a simplified updating rule of the log - likelihood - ratio ( llr ) message in the jcnc decoder .",
    "furthermore , we derive the bit - error - rate ( ber ) formula utilizing the updating rule and gaussian approximation .",
    "it is shown that the the ber formula is in agreement with the simulated results and reduces the computational complexity as compared to the protograph extrinsic information transfer ( pexit ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : system ] , the proposed stbc - jcnc scheme is described . in section [",
    "sect : performance ] , we provide the simplified llr - updating rule and analyze the system performance .",

    "consider an alamouti stbc - based @xcite two - way relay system with two sources ( a and b ) and one relay ( r ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig.1 ] , in which all the terminals are equipped with two antennas ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) . for this system ,",
    "both two sources are to obtain information from each other with the assistance of the relay .",

    "afterwards , the binary coded bits @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) are converted into @xmath8 by a bpsk modulator and then mapped onto an @xmath9 stbc transmit matrix @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the transmit time slot ) , denoted as @xmath12 $ ] ( where `` @xmath13 '' is the conjugate of a variable ) . as shown in @xcite , it is impossible to directly decode the xor codeword @xmath14 from the received signals at the relay .",
    "moreover , to separately decode @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoding @xcite is not applicable for jcnc , because ml decoding of general linear codes is well - known to be non - deterministic polynomial - time hard ( np - hard ) . to resolve this problem ,",
    "the precoders for the stbc signals of the two sources should be properly designed before transmission in order to facilitate the decoding of @xmath17 .",
    "we first denote @xmath18 as the @xmath19 precoding matrix for z and will introduce the detailed design of the precoding matrices later .",
    "the transmission scheme includes two stages : multiple access ( mac ) and broadcast ( bc ) . in the mac stage , the two sources ( i.e. , a and b ) transmit stbc signals to the relay simultaneously over nakagami fading channels . for the @xmath20-th ( @xmath21 ) antenna at the relay ,",

    "the estimated information is re - encoded , modulated , and stbc - mapped .",
    "after that , the stbc signal @xmath33 is broadcasted to both the two sources . in this paper , we only focus on the mac stage , because the decoding performance at the relay is critical to the whole performance of such transmission mechanism @xcite .",
    "firstly , we assume that each source know the perfect reciprocal csi in our system .",
    "the design of the two precoders at the sources should satisfy two conditions .",
    "one is that the total transmission power of each source should be kept as @xmath34 ; secondly , inspired by the maximum - ratio - combined ( mrc ) signals of the conventional stbc system @xcite and the principle of pnc @xcite , the relay should try to group the messages from a and b , i.e. , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , together .",

    "for example , to achieve a ber of @xmath150 , the required @xmath96 of the siso - jcnc , stbc - jcnc with @xmath144 , and proposed stbc - jcnc are respectively @xmath151  db , @xmath152  db , and @xmath153  db . in the same figure , at a ber of @xmath150 , the threshold agrees well with the corresponding analytical @xmath96 within @xmath154  db for all the ber curves .",
    "furthermore , the difference between the simulated @xmath96 and the analytical @xmath96 is around @xmath155  db , which is shown to be consistent with the results in @xcite .",

    "<S> this work considers the protograph - coded physical network coding ( pnc ) based on alamouti space - time block coding ( stbc ) over nakagami - fading two - way relay channels , in which both the two sources and relay possess two antennas . </S>",

    "<S> based on the simplified llr - updating rule and gaussian approximation , we analyze the theoretical bit - error - rate ( ber ) of the system , which is shown to be consistent with the decoding thresholds and simulated results . moreover , the theoretical analysis has lower computational complexity than the protograph extrinsic information transfer ( pexit ) algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the analysis not only provides a simple way to evaluate the error performance but also facilitates the design of the joint channel - and - pnc ( jcnc ) in wireless communication scenarios . </S>"
