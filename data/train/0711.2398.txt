    "ngc 2362 is a very young open cluster , at a moderate distance .",
    "we adopt the parameters of @xcite for the remainder of this work : an age of @xmath4 , distance @xmath5 and reddening @xmath6 .",
    "note however that there is some controversy in the literature regarding the age of this cluster , with estimates ranging from @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite have examined the relative ages of young open clusters , finding that ngc 2362 does indeed seem to be older than the onc , but that it may be younger than ic 348 , and they suggest an age of @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless , the extremely young age , and lack of substantial nebulosity or differential reddening in this cluster make it an ideal testing ground for theories of pre - main sequence stellar evolution .",
    "@xcite carried out an extensive spectroscopic survey , concentrating on the h@xmath9 @xmath10 and li  i @xmath11 features , finding that a large fraction ( @xmath12 per cent ) of the t tauri star ( tts ) population in ngc 2362 is composed of weak - line emitters ( wtts ) , as expected given the canonical @xmath13 age for the cluster .",
    "they found that @xmath14 per cent of the tts population are likely to still be undergoing accretion on the basis of the measured h@xmath9 equivalent widths , which is comparable to the fraction of objects found to exhibit l - band excess emission indicative of an inner disc by @xcite .",
    "ngc 2362 has also been observed more recently with using the irac ( infra - red array camera ) instrument in the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands .",
    "@xcite used these observations to derive spectral energy distributions for candidate ngc 2362 members , and to characterise disc emission in objects exhibiting infra - red excesses .",
    "they found an upper limit to the fraction of objects exhibiting optically thick discs of @xmath19 per cent , with an additional @xmath20 per cent of objects exhibiting weak or optically thin discs .",
    "a long - standing issue in our understanding of the evolution of stellar rotation rates on the pre - main sequence is that significant loss of angular momentum appears to be required in order to reproduce the observed rotation rates of low - mass stars .    during the first few myr of their evolution , low - mass pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars contract by factors of @xmath21 .",
    "hence , if angular momentum is conserved , all sub - solar mass stars , which are thought to have initial rotation periods of @xmath22 , should rotate at periods shorter than @xmath23 after only @xmath24 .",
    "observations at these ages show that some stars rotate much slower than this rate , and indeed the slowest rotators do not appear to spin up at all over the first few myr of their evolution .",
    "the most popular scenarios for solving this problem invoke additional angular momentum losses resulting from the interaction of the star with a circumstellar disc ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the `` disc locking '' scenario , this interaction results in transfer of angular momentum from the star to the disc , which maintains a constant stellar rotation rate until the disc dissipates sufficiently to break the coupling .",
    "alternatively , the angular momentum may be lost through an enhanced stellar wind , powered by the accretion of material from the disc @xcite .    in both cases ,",
    "the most basic prediction of the models is that there should be a correlation between rotation rate and the presence of discs , in the sense that the slow rotators should still be surrounded by discs , whereas for the rapid rotators , the discs should have dispersed .    much of the recent literature on rotation has been devoted to the search for a correlation between rotation rate and disc indicators , including diagnostics of accretion ( uv excess , spectral line diagnostics such as h@xmath9 , etc . ) and of the thermal emission from the disc itself ( infra - red excess ) .",
    "many of the early studies were inconclusive , due to a combination of effects including small sample sizes , biases , dependence of the adopted disc indicators on other stellar parameters ( predominantly mass ) , and the use of ambiguous disc indicators .",
    "two recent studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) have claimed statistically significant detections of the expected correlation between slow rotators and circumstellar discs , in the onc ( @xmath25 ; @xcite ) and ngc 2264 ( @xmath26 ; @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "@xcite have also examined ic 348 ( @xmath27 ; @xcite ) , but the results were ambiguous due to small number statistics .",
    "these studies have all used the irac instrument on the space telescope , which provides mid - ir photometry in four broad bands : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath28 . in particular , @xmath29 infra - red flux excesses provide a much more reliable indicator of the presence of circumstellar discs than shorter - wavelength ir excesses ( e.g. in the @xmath30-band ) .",
    "there is thus mounting evidence in favour of the disc regulation paradigm , but nevertheless , it is important to verify that this result extends to older open clusters .      we have undertaken a photometric survey in ngc 2362 using the ctio 4 m blanco telescope and mosaic - ii imager .",
    "our goals are two - fold : first , to study rotation periods for a sample of low - mass members , covering k and m spectral types , down to @xmath31 , and second , to look for eclipsing binary systems containing low - mass stars , to obtain dynamical mass measurements in conjunction with radial velocities from follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "such systems provide the most accurate determinations of fundamental stellar parameters ( in particular , masses ) for input to models of stellar evolution , which are poorly constrained in this age range . we defer discussion of our search for occultations to another publication ( miller et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "these observations are part of a larger photometric monitoring survey of young open clusters over a range of ages and metalicities ( the monitor project ; @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows : the observations and data reduction are described in  [ odr_section ] , and the colour magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the cluster and candidate membership selection are presented in  [ memb_section ] .",
    "the method we use for obtaining photometric periods is summarised in  [ period_section ] ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "our results are given in ",
    "[ results_section ] , and  [ conclusions_section ] summarises our conclusions .    in several of the following sections , we use mass and radius estimates for the cluster members .",
    "these were derived from the @xmath32 nextgen models , using the @xmath33-band magnitudes , rather than @xmath34 colour or @xmath35 magnitude , for reasons discussed in  [ cmd_section ] .",
    "photometric monitoring observations were obtained using the 4 m ctio blanco telescope , with the mosaic - ii imager , on @xmath36nights between 2005 dec 24 and 2006 jan 06 .",
    "this instrument provides a field of view of @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , using a mosaic of eight @xmath39 pixel ccds , at a scale of @xmath40 .    a single field in ngc 2362 , centred on the star @xmath41 cma ( see figure [ coverage ] ) ,",

    "we also obtained deep @xmath35-band exposures ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) which were stacked and used to produce a colour - magnitude diagram of the cluster .",

    "briefly , we used the pipeline for the int wide - field survey @xcite for 2-d instrumental signature removal ( bias correction , flatfielding , defringing ) and astrometric and photometric calibration .",
    "we then generated a master catalogue for each filter by stacking @xmath53 of the frames taken in the best conditions ( seeing , sky brightness and transparency ) and running the source detection software on the stacked image .",

    "the diagonal dashed line shows the expected rms from poisson noise in the object , the diagonal dot - dashed line shows the rms from sky noise in the photometric aperture , and the dotted line shows an additional @xmath60 contribution added in quadrature to account for systematic effects .",
    "the solid line shows the overall predicted rms , combining these contributions.,width=307 ]    our source detection software flags any objects detected as having overlapping isophotes .",
    "this information is used , in conjunction with a morphological image classification flag also generated by the pipeline software @xcite to allow us to identify non - stellar or blended objects in the time - series photometry .",
    "photometric calibration of our data was carried out using regular observations of @xcite equatorial standard star fields in the usual way .",
    "light curves were extracted from the data for @xmath61 objects , @xmath62 of which had stellar morphological classifications ( @xmath63 per cent of these are flagged as blended ) , using our standard aperture photometry techniques , described in @xcite . we fit a 2-d quadratic polynomial to the residuals in each frame ( measured for each object as the difference between its magnitude on the frame in question and the median calculated across all frames ) as a function of position , for each of the @xmath64 ccds separately .",
    "subsequent removal of this function accounts for effects such as varying differential atmospheric extinction across each frame . over a single ccd ,",
    "the spatially - varying part of the correction remains small , typically @xmath65 peak - to - peak .",
    "the reasons for using this technique are discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "for the production of deep cmds , we stacked 20 @xmath44-band observations , taken in good seeing and photometric conditions , and all of the @xmath35-band observations .",
    "the limiting magnitudes on these stacked images , measured as the approximate magnitude at which our catalogues are @xmath66 per cent complete , were @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "catalogues of candidate ngc 2362 members are available in the literature ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but we elected to perform a new photometric selection using @xmath35 versus @xmath69 cmds from our data in order to properly match the relatively large field of view of our time - series observations compared to these previous studies .",
    "our cmd of ngc 2362 is shown in figure [ cmd ] . the @xmath35 and @xmath44 measurements were converted to the standard johnson - cousins photometric system using colour equations derived from our standard star observations : @xmath70     versus @xmath34 cmd of ngc 2362 from stacked images , for all objects with stellar morphological classification .",

    "the error bars at the left - hand side of the plot indicate the typical photometric error for an object on the cluster sequence.,width=336 ]    candidate cluster members were selected by defining an empirical cluster sequence ` by eye ' to follow the clearly - visible cluster single - star sequence .",
    "the cuts were defined by moving this line along a vector perpendicular to the cluster sequence , by amounts @xmath75 and @xmath76 as measured along this vector , where @xmath77 is the photometric error in the @xmath34 colour .",
    "the values of @xmath78 used were @xmath79 for the lower line and @xmath80 for the upper line on the diagram , making the brighter region wider to avoid rejecting binary and multiple systems , which are overluminous for their colour compared to single stars .",
    "@xmath81 candidate photometric members were selected , over the full @xmath35 magnitude range from @xmath82 to @xmath83 , but the well - defined cluster sequence appears to terminate at @xmath84 , or @xmath85 , with a few candidate brown dwarfs found below this limit , but with high field contamination .",
    "we also considered using the model isochrones of @xcite and @xcite for selecting candidate members .",
    "the nextgen model isochrones were found to be unsuitable due to the known discrepancy between these models and observations in the @xmath34 colour for @xmath86 ( corresponding here to @xmath87 ) .",
    "this was examined in more detail by @xcite , and is due to a missing source of opacity at these temperatures , leading to overestimation of the @xmath35-band flux .",
    "consequently , when we have used the nextgen isochrones to determine model masses and radii for our objects , the @xmath33-band absolute magnitudes were used to perform the relevant look - up , since these are less susceptible to the missing source of opacity , and hence give more robust estimates .",
    "since the cluster sequence is not well - separated from the field in the cmd , it is important to estimate the level of field star contamination in the sample of candidate cluster members .",
    "this has been done using two independent methods .",
    "the besanon galactic models @xcite were used to to generate a simulated catalogue of objects passing our selection criteria at the galactic coordinates of ngc 2362 ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) , covering the total fov of @xmath90 ( including gaps between detectors ) . the same selection process as above for the cluster members was applied to this catalogue to find the contaminant objects .",
    "a total of @xmath91 simulated objects passed these membership selection criteria , giving an overall contamination level of @xmath92 per cent after correcting for bins where the number of objects predicted by the models exceeded the number actually observed by @xmath93 per cent ( we simply assumed @xmath94 per cent field contamination in these bins ) .",
    "figure [ contam ] shows the contamination as a function of @xmath35 magnitude .",
    "note that this figure is somewhat uncertain due to the need to use galactic models , and especially given the overestimation of the numbers of observed objects by the models , which lends low confidence to the results derived in this section .",
    "we therefore pursue an alternative method for obtaining a limit to the contamination level below .",
    "per cent ( where there were more objects in that bin from the galactic model than were actually observed ) have been truncated to @xmath94 per cent.,width=288 ]      an alternative method for generating a simple upper limit to the contamination level has also been applied to verify the results obtained from the galactic models . since the cluster is relatively centrally concentrated , we divided the population of candidate cluster members into two bins in radius , using as the centre the position of the star @xmath41 cma .",
    "number counts of objects selected using the cmd as candidate members were then produced inside and outside of a @xmath95 radius , chosen since it roughly divides the area covered into two , providing good statistics in both bins . by assuming the stars inside @xmath95 are cluster members , and those outside are not , we can obtain a simple upper limit to the contamination level by dividing these counts , and correcting for the relative area covered by each bin .",
    "figure [ contam_radial ] shows the resulting distribution of contamination as a function of magnitude , for comparison with the galactic model results in figure [ contam ] .",
    "the overall contamination level integrated over all magnitude bins from this method is @xmath96 per cent , comparable to the estimate using the galactic models from section [ galmod_sect ]",
    ".    -band magnitude.,width=288 ]",
    "the method we use for detection of periodic variables is described in detail in @xcite , and we provide only a brief summary here .",
    "the method uses least - squares fitting of sine curves to the time series @xmath97 ( in magnitudes ) for _ all _ candidate cluster members , using the form : @xmath98 where @xmath99 ( the dc light curve level ) , @xmath9 ( the amplitude ) and @xmath100 ( the phase ) are free parameters at each value of @xmath101 over an equally - spaced grid of frequencies , corresponding to periods from @xmath102 for the present data - set .",

    "these morphological features do not appear to be a result of sample biases .",
    "in particular , the simulations show that the survey is sensitive to much shorter periods than @xmath125 , and the upper limit in detectable periods is not mass - dependent , so this can not explain the sloping morphology of the upper envelope of rotation periods in figure [ pcd ] at low masses .",

    ", we can constrain the amount of angular momentum loss required during this part of the evolution .    in order to do this ,",
    "we have used a simple model of solid body rotation from @xcite , including angular momentum losses due to main sequence magnetically driven stellar winds ( the effect of which is close to negligible during this age range ) , but specifically , not including any additional sources of angular momentum loss ( `` disc locking '' or similar ) in order to see if the latter are required to explain the observations .",
    "our models from the earlier ngc 2516 and ngc 2547 work incorporated a simple prescription for core - envelope decoupling , but at these early ages the stars are fully - convective , so it is not necessary to incorporate this effect here .",

    "note that these models assume no additional sources of angular momentum loss on the early - pms.,width=288 ]    the model clearly can not successfully reproduce the ngc 2362 distribution .",
    "although there is some hint of the sloping relation at low masses visible in the evolved onc distribution , the slowest rotators at @xmath138 are clearly rotating too rapidly .",
    "however , the lower envelope of fast rotators is reasonably well - reproduced throughout the mass range .",
    "we suspect that the mass determinations ( which are based on @xmath33-band luminosity ) are somewhat unreliable in the onc , due to the presence of strong spatially - variable extinction in this cluster .",
    "this introduces horizontal scatter in the period versus mass plane .",
    "it has been necessary to assume a typical ( low ) value of this parameter for many of the low - mass detections due to a lack of suitable estimates based on spectroscopy from @xcite .",
    "hence , much of the scatter at low masses in the figure may be due to underestimation of the extinction , and hence of the masses , for highly reddened objects .",
    "however , at the high - mass end , the diagram is more reliable , since the majority of the scatter due to extinction will only move objects to the right .",
    "therefore , the result that the slowest rotators at these masses are rotating too rapidly is still significant .",
    "this indicates that an additional source of angular momentum loss is required , in order to hold the rotation periods of these stars approximately constant ( since the slowest rotators in the onc and ngc 2362 appear to have very similar periods of @xmath22 ) .",
    "this is precisely the result found by many other authors , and provides evidence in support of disc regulation , or a similar mechanism , operating over the early - pms stages of the evolution .",
    "we note that the age of the onc is still a subject of controversy in the literature at the time of writing",
    ". some recent studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) have indicated that the distance to the onc may be @xmath139 , rather than the conventional value of @xmath140 used by @xcite .",
    "depending on the pms evolutionary tracks used , this can raise the derived age to @xmath141 , which may help to explain these apparent discrepancies .",
    "we have explored this further in figure [ pmd_evol_onc_2 ] , which shows the result of assuming a @xmath142 age for the onc , and evolving the rotation period distribution forward in time .",
    "since the models then predict less spin - up , it is not surprising that the slow rotators at solar mass are better - fit , but still with evidence for ( more modest ) angular momentum loss being required to fully - reproduce the ngc 2362 slow rotator population .",
    "however , at lower masses , the resulting slower rotation for the bulk of these objects places the upper limit to the rotation periods even higher than observed in ngc 2362 . raising the age of the onc",
    "does not therefore readily provide an explanation for the problems at the low - mass end that have already been discussed .    , except assuming a @xmath143 age for the onc.,width=288 ]    we have also repeated the analysis using ngc 2264 as the initial condition .",
    "figure [ pmd_evol_n2264 ] shows the results , where we have assumed a @xmath144 age for this cluster .",
    "ngc 2264 has much less differentially - variable reddening than the onc , so the low - mass end of the diagram should be more reliably reproduced in this cluster .    , except using ngc 2264 as the initial condition , assuming an age of @xmath144.,width=288 ]    the diagram indicates that this is indeed the case , and that the sloping relation for the slow rotators at low masses in ngc 2362 is well - reproduced by evolving the ngc 2264 observations forward in time .",
    "again however , the slowest rotators at higher masses ( @xmath145 ) appear to rotate too rapidly compared to the ngc 2362 observations .",
    "given that these models do not incorporate additional sources of angular momentum loss applying to the early - pms , such as disc regulation , the ability of the models to reproduce the form of the sloping relation for the lowest - mass stars ( @xmath146 ) indicates that these stars do not experience significant angular momentum loss at this stage of their evolution , in contrast to the higher - mass stars .",
    "we also demonstrated in our earlier ngc 2516 and ngc 2547 publications ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , that a similar statement applies to the lowest - mass stars at later stages in their evolution : even from the @xmath147 age of ngc 2362 to the @xmath148 age of ngc 2516 , additional angular momentum loss at @xmath149 above that expected due to ( saturated ) stellar winds does not appear to be required .",
    "given that the higher - mass stars do appear to need additional angular momentum losses , this implies that such losses are mass - dependent , in the sense that lower - mass stars experience less pms angular momentum loss , or that they lose angular momentum over a shorter timescale ( @xmath150 ) than the higher - mass stars .      in order to search for the correlation between rotation period and the presence of discs expected in the disc regulation paradigm for early - pms angular momentum evolution , we combined the present optical data - set with the irac photometry of @xcite . note that @xcite only give mid - ir measurements for objects detected in their combined photometric and spectroscopic survey of the central @xmath151 of the cluster @xcite , whereas the field - of - view is somewhat larger , so this decreases the available sample size .",
    "a re - analysis of the observations to resolve this problem will be attempted in a future publication .",
    "there are @xmath152 stars in common with the catalogue of @xcite which have rotation period measurements .",
    "however , in order to obtain a meaningful result , we must restrict the mass range over which the samples are compared : not doing so would introduce a bias at the faint end toward those objects with excesses , since they are more readily detected in the mid - ir data . examining figure 1 of @xcite",
    "indicates that the irac detection limit is at @xmath153 \\simeq 15 $ ] , and using the models of @xcite for the @xmath154-band ( which is a reasonable approximation to the @xmath155 band ) , this corresponds to a conservative limit of @xmath156 , which has been adopted henceforth .",
    "we have considered two commonly - used indicators of the presence of a circumstellar disc : the slope of the irac spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , @xmath157 , as used by @xcite , and the @xmath158 - [ 8.0]$ ] colour , as used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure [ disc_period ] shows a plot of these quantities as a function of rotation period .",
    "( smallest symbols ) to @xmath115 ( largest symbols ) .",
    "* top : * sed slope @xmath9 as a function of rotation period . *",
    "bottom : * @xmath158 - [ 8.0]$ ] colour as a function of rotation period .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the approximate boundaries in these quantities between regions of the diagram occupied by objects with and without discs , as discussed in the text.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]   ( smallest symbols ) to @xmath115 ( largest symbols ) . *",
    "top : * sed slope @xmath9 as a function of rotation period",
    ". * bottom : * @xmath158 - [ 8.0]$ ] colour as a function of rotation period .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the approximate boundaries in these quantities between regions of the diagram occupied by objects with and without discs , as discussed in the text.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    thresholds were defined in these quantities , following @xcite for @xmath9 , with stellar photospheres having @xmath159 , `` weak discs '' @xmath160 , and `` primordial '' or optically thick discs @xmath161 . in @xmath158 - [ 8.0]$ ]",
    "colour , we follow @xcite , and use a threshold of @xmath158 - [ 8.0 ] > 0.7 $ ] to identify objects with mid - ir excesses indicative of the presence of discs .",
    "figure [ disc_period ] clearly indicates that the `` primordial '' discs as defined by sed slope , and the excess objects in @xmath158 - [ 8.0]$ ] , are essentially the same .    both panels of figure [ disc_period ] indicate that the @xmath3 objects showing strong disc signatures all have long periods , whereas the remainder of the objects show a range of periods , as would be expected in the disc regulation paradigm",
    "this is also seen in distributions of rotation periods in these bins , which are shown in figure [ disc_phist ] .    , showing : objects with ir excesses ( `` primordial discs '' , or @xmath162 : solid line ) , objects without large ir excesses ( `` weak discs '' and `` photospheres '' , or @xmath163 : dashed line ) , and the entire sample for comparison ( dotted line ) .",
    "poisson error bars are shown.,width=288 ]    applying a two - sided k - s test to the distributions of objects with and without ir excesses gave probabilities of @xmath164 ( using @xmath165 to select the objects with significant excesses , corresponding to the `` primordial disc '' objects in figure [ disc_period ] ) , and @xmath166 ( using @xmath158 - [ 8.0 ] > 0.7 $ ] ) that the distributions were drawn from the same parent population .",
    "since the k - s test is not strictly appropriate for such a small sample size , we also considered a simple probabilistic argument : of the @xmath167 objects without excesses , @xmath168 have periods @xmath169 .",
    "the probability that all three objects with excesses were drawn from this same parent population is therefore @xmath170 .",
    "these results indicate that the differences are not statistically significant .",
    "this is most likely due to the small sample size .    in spite of this",
    ", the distributions do indeed hint at the expected result for the disc regulation paradigm , that the objects with discs should be slow rotators , as seen e.g. by @xcite and @xcite . obtaining a larger sample of objects with rotation period and mid - ir measurements",
    "should improve the significance of these results , and allow more definitive conclusions to be made .",
    "we have reported on results of an @xmath44-band photometric survey of ngc 2362 , covering @xmath171 of the cluster .",
    "selection of candidate members in a @xmath35 versus @xmath69 colour - magnitude diagram using an empirical fit to the cluster sequence found @xmath81 candidate members , over a @xmath35 magnitude range of @xmath172 ( covering masses from @xmath115 down to below the brown dwarf limit ) .",
    "the likely field contamination level was estimated using a simulated catalogue of field objects from the besanon galactic models @xcite , finding an overall contamination level of @xmath173 per cent , implying that there are @xmath174 real cluster members over this mass range in our field - of - view .",
    "we derived light curves for @xmath61 objects in the ngc 2362 field , achieving a precision of @xmath55 per cent per data point over @xmath175 .",
    "the light curves of our candidate cluster members were searched for periodic variability corresponding to stellar rotation , giving @xmath0 detections over the mass range @xmath176 .",
    "the rotation period distribution as a function of mass was found to show a clear mass - dependent morphology , as seen in our earlier ngc 2547 , ngc 2516 and m34 studies , and qualitatively similar to that in ngc 2264 , which is thought to have a similar age .    using rotational evolution models from our earlier ngc 2516 work @xcite",
    ", we were able to show that distribution of rotation rates for the rapid rotators in ngc 2362 could be reproduced from the distributions in the onc and ngc 2264 by evolving them forward in time to @xmath147 .",
    "however , for the slow rotators at masses @xmath177 , the predicted rotation rates from the models were too rapid , with the observations indicating that the rotation periods of these stars are in fact approximately constant over the @xmath178 age range .",
    "this confirms the need for additional angular momentum losses on this part of the pms , e.g. as would be expected in the disc regulation paradigm .",
    "finally , we have used the observations of @xcite to test the disc regulation hypothesis , by searching for a correlation between rotation rate and mid - ir excesses indicative of circumstellar discs .",
    "no statistically significant correlation was found with the present small sample sizes , but the @xmath3 objects with significant disc signatures in the sample are indeed all slow rotators .",
