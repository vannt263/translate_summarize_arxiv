    "the simple loop conjecture , proved by gabai in @xcite , states that any non - injective homomorphism from a closed surface group to another closed surface group has an element represented by a simple closed curve in the kernel .",
    "it has been conjectured that the result still holds if the target is replaced by the fundamental group of an orientable 3-manifold ( see kirby s problem list in @xcite ) .",
    "although special cases have been proved ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , the general hyperbolic case is still open .",
    "recently , cooper and manning showed that if instead of a 3-manifold group the target group is @xmath1 , then the conjecture is false .",
    "precisely , they show :    [ cmthm ] let @xmath2 be a closed orientable surface of genus @xmath3 . then there is a homomorphism @xmath4 such that    1 .",
    "@xmath5 is not injective 2 .   if @xmath6 , then @xmath7 is not represented by a simple closed curve 3 .",
    "if @xmath8 has finite order , then @xmath9    the third condition implies in particular that no _ power _ of a simple closed curve lies in the kernel .    inspired by this , we asked whether a similar result holds for @xmath0 , this being an intermediate case between gabai s result for surface groups and cooper and manning s for @xmath10 .",
    "cooper and manning s proof uses a dimension count on the @xmath10 character variety and a proof that a specific subvariety is irreducible and smooth on a dense subset , much of which does not carry over to the @xmath11 case . in general , complex varieties and",
    "their real points can behave quite differently .",
    "however , we show here with different methods that an analogous result does hold .    while this note was in progress , we learned of work of louder and calegari ( independently in @xcite and @xcite ) that can also be applied to answer our question in the affirmative .",
    "louder shows the simple loop conjecture is false for representations into limit groups , and calegari gives a practical way of verifying no simple closed curves lie in the kernel of a non - injective representation using stable commutator length and the gromov norm .",
    "the difference here is that our construction is entirely elementary .",
    "we use an explicit representation from deblois and kent in @xcite and verify that this representation it is non injective and kills no simple closed curve by elementary means .",
    "our end result parallels that of cooper and manning but also include surfaces with boundary and all genera at least 1 :    [ main ] let @xmath2 a surface of negative euler characteristic and of genus @xmath12 , possibly with boundary . then there is a homomorphism @xmath13 such that    1 .",
    "@xmath5 is not injective 2 .   if @xmath6 , then @xmath7 is not represented by a simple closed curve 3 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath7 is represented by a simple closed curve , then @xmath14 for any @xmath15 .    moreover , there are uncountably many non - conjugate representations satisfying 1 . through 3 .",
    "we first present a construction of a ( non - injective ) representation from deblois and kent in @xcite , and then show that no power of a simple closed curve lies in the kernel of this representation .",
    "the full construction appears in @xcite , we describe it here for convenience .",
    "let @xmath2 be a surface of genus @xmath12 and negative euler characteristic , possibly with boundary .",
    "assume for the moment that @xmath2 is not the once - puntured torus  theorem [ main ] for this case will follow easily later on .",
    "let @xmath16 be a simple closed curve separating @xmath2 into a genus 1 subsurface with single boundary component @xmath17 , and a genus ( @xmath18 ) subsurface with one or more boundary components .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the genus @xmath20 subsurface and @xmath21 the genus 1 subsurface .",
    "see figure [ setup ] below .",
    "finally , we let @xmath22 and @xmath23 , so that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the @xmath26-subgroup generated by the element @xmath27 $ ] represented by the curve @xmath17 . we assume that the basepoint for @xmath28 lies on @xmath17 .        projecting this representation to @xmath0",
    "gives a representation which is upper triangular , hence solvable and therefore non - injective .",
    "abusing notation , let @xmath41 denote the representation to @xmath0 .",
    "now let @xmath42 be fuchsian and such that the image of the boundary curve @xmath17 under @xmath43 agrees with @xmath44)$ ] .",
    "such a representation exists for the following reasons .",
    "first , if @xmath2 has negative euler characteristic , genus @xmath45 , and is not the once punctured torus , then @xmath19 will have negative euler characteristic as well and admit a hyperbolic structure . secondly , the fuchsian representation coming from the hyperbolic structure will send the element @xmath27 $ ] representing the boundary curve to a parabolic , so after conjugation we may assume that it is equal to @xmath44)$ ] , provided @xmath44)$ ] is parabolic , i.e. @xmath46 .          our next goal is to show that for appropriate choice of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the representation @xmath47 satisfies the criteria in theorem [ main ] .",
    "the main difficulty will be checking that no element representing a simple closed curve is of finite order .",
    "to do so , we employ a stronger form of lemma 2 from @xcite .",
    "this is :    [ transcendental ] suppose @xmath54 is a word of the form @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "assume that for each @xmath59 , the matrix @xmath60 has a nonzero 2,1 entry and @xmath61 is hyperbolic . if @xmath53 is transcendental over the entry field of @xmath62 , then @xmath63 is not finite order .        in @xcite ,",
    "deblois and kent show by a straightforward induction that the entries of @xmath63 are polynomials in @xmath53 , where the degree of the 2,2 entry is @xmath66 , the degree of the 1,2 entry is at most @xmath66 , and the other entries have degree at most @xmath67 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath63 is finite order .",
    "then it is conjugate to a matrix of the form @xmath68 . where @xmath69 and @xmath70 for some rational angle @xmath71 .",
    "in particular , it follows from the demoivre formula for sine and cosine that @xmath72 and @xmath73 are algebraic .",
    "now suppose that the matrix conjugating @xmath63 to @xmath68 has entries @xmath74 .",
    "then we have @xmath75 looking at the 2,2 entry we see that @xmath76 must be a polynomial in @xmath53 of degree @xmath66 . but",
    "this means that the 1,1 entry is also a polynomial in @xmath53 of degree @xmath66 , contradicting deblois and kent s calculation .",
    "this proves the lemma .    to complete our construction , choose @xmath53 to be transcendental over the entry field of @xmath77 .",
    "we want to show that no power of an element representing a simple closed curve lies in the kernel of @xmath47 . to this end , consider any word @xmath78 in @xmath79 that has a simple closed curve as a representative .",
    "there are three cases to check .",
    "first , if @xmath78 is a word in @xmath80 alone , then @xmath63 is not finite order , since @xmath81 is fuchsian and therefore injective .",
    "secondly , if @xmath78 is a word in @xmath82 , then an elementary geometric argument shows that @xmath78 can only be represented by a simple closed curve if it has one of the following forms :    1 .",
    "@xmath83 or @xmath84 2 .",
    "@xmath85 $ ] 3 .",
    "up to replacing @xmath86 with @xmath87 , @xmath88 with @xmath89 and interchanging @xmath86 and @xmath88 , there is some @xmath90 such that @xmath91 where @xmath92 .      by construction ,",
    "no word of type 1 , 2 or 3 is finite order provided that @xmath93 for any integers @xmath94 and @xmath95 other than zero  indeed , we only need to check words of type 3 , and these necessarily have trace @xmath96 for some @xmath97 .",
    "note that in particular , under the condition that @xmath93 for @xmath97 , all type 3 words are hyperbolic .",
    "we will use this fact again later on .    for the remaining case where @xmath78 is a word with letters in both @xmath80 and @xmath82",
    ", we claim that it can be written in a form where lemma [ transcendental ] applies . to write it this way , use the following procedure :",
    "first take a simple representative @xmath98 for @xmath78 and apply an isotopy so that each crossing of @xmath98 with @xmath17 occurs in some small neighborhood of the basepoint @xmath99 .",
    "this gives us a well defined shortest path along @xmath17 to @xmath99 from each crossing .",
    "after further isotopy , we may assume additionally that no segment of @xmath98 together with the shortest path along @xmath17 from its endpoints to @xmath99 bounds a disc , and that @xmath98 is transverse to @xmath17 .",
    "all this can be done without introducing any self - crossings in @xmath98 .",
    "now @xmath98 is of the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a simple arc in @xmath19 and @xmath102 a simple arc in @xmath21 .",
    "close each @xmath101 and @xmath102 into a simple loop by connecting its endpoints to @xmath99 using the shortest path along @xmath17 and let @xmath56 ( respectively @xmath57 ) be the corresponding element of the fundamental group .",
    "see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this gives us a word @xmath103 equivalent to @xmath78 after cyclic reduction , and each @xmath104 is represented by a simple closed curve in @xmath19 and each @xmath105 by a simple closed curve in @xmath21 .",
    "the elimination of discs bounded between segments of @xmath98 and short segments of @xmath17 ensures that each @xmath104 and @xmath105 is nontrivial .",
    "we can also show that each @xmath104 either has a non - zero 2,1 entry or is represented by the curve @xmath17 or its inverse .",
    "this is because @xmath43 is fuchsian , so the only elements fixing infinity  that is , with 2,1 entry equal to zero  are powers of @xmath17 , and no powers of @xmath17 other than @xmath106 have a simple closed curve representative .",
    "similarly , the classification of words representing simple closed curves in @xmath21 shows that each @xmath105 is either hyperbolic or represented by @xmath17 or @xmath107 .",
    "we claim that we may now rewrite @xmath78 to eliminate all appearances of @xmath17 , keeping each @xmath104 with a non - zero 2,1 entry and each @xmath105 hyperbolic . after doing so",
    ", we will have @xmath78 in a form where we can apply lemma [ transcendental ] .    to rewrite @xmath78 in the desired form , first note that all @xmath101 such that @xmath104 is represented by @xmath17 may be homotoped ( simultaneously ) into @xmath108 without introducing any self intersections of @xmath98 .",
    "thus , we can replace each such @xmath109 with a simple loop @xmath110 in @xmath21 alone , and rewrite @xmath111 .",
    "reindex so that @xmath112 for @xmath113 , and reindex the corresponding @xmath102 and @xmath101 as well .",
    "now repeat the procedure on this new word with each @xmath105 : homotope all @xmath102 such that @xmath105 is represented by @xmath17 over to @xmath19 without introducing any self intersections of @xmath98 , and then replace each such @xmath114 with a simple loop @xmath115 in @xmath21 alone . then rewrite @xmath78 so that , after reindexing , @xmath116 with @xmath117 and each @xmath104 and @xmath105 is a simple closed curve . repeat the process again with the @xmath104 of this new word .",
    "the procedure ends when either no @xmath104 or @xmath105 is represented by @xmath17 , or when @xmath78 is a word in @xmath80 or @xmath82 alone , represented by a simple loop in @xmath19 or @xmath21 . in the first case",
    ", lemma [ transcendental ] applies to show that @xmath63 is not finite order . in the second case",
    ", we have already shown that a word in @xmath80 or @xmath82 represented by a simple loop in @xmath19 or @xmath21 can not be finite order .",
    "it remains only to remark that the representation @xmath47 is non - injective and that , by choosing appropriate parameters , we can produce uncountably many nonconjugate representations .",
    "non - injectivity follows immediately since @xmath118 is solvable so the restriction of @xmath47 to @xmath82 is non - injective . now for any fixed @xmath7 and @xmath33 ( satisfying the requirement that @xmath93 for all integers @xmath119 ) , varying @xmath53 among transcendentals over the entry field of @xmath62 produces uncountably many non - conjugate representations that are all non - injective , but have no power of a simple closed curve in the kernel .",
    "this concludes the proof of theorem [ main ] , assuming that the surface was not the punctured torus .",
    "the punctured torus case is now immediate : any representation of the form of @xmath41 where @xmath93 for any integers @xmath94 and @xmath95 is non - injective and our work above shows that no element represented by a simple closed curve has finite order .",
    "fixing @xmath7 and varying @xmath33 produces uncountably many non - conjugate representations ."
