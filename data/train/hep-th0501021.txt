    "the structure of the black hole , which consists of both a central singularity and a ball of the quantum - fluctuation of the fields , is similar to the atomic structure .",
    "especially we concretely constructed the minimal structure model for near extremal - charged black hole .",
    "the minimal structure model contains a single quantum of the field - fluctuation .",
    "the structure of the minimal model is quite similar to that of the hydrogen atom and has the minimal schwarzschild radius @xmath142 .",
    "while our model describes the near extremal - charged black hole , we expect that the model also describes the extremal limit @xmath155 .",
    "the situation of our model is the same as that of the radiation ball model for charged black hole @xcite where the extremal - charged black hole was expected to be described as `` the fully frozen radiation - ball '' .",
    "our model of the extremal limit has the same @xmath153 in figure [ fig1.f.eps ] and the same @xmath154 in figure [ fig3.rho.eps ] .",
    "the distribution of the metric element @xmath139 in the extremal limit corresponds with that in the non - extremal solution except for the divergence of @xmath139 on the peak at @xmath156 ( see figure [ fig2.fg.eps ] ) .",
    "for the extremal limit , the potential - well becomes infinitely deep and the quantum - fluctuation freezes up because the metric element @xmath138 in the ball goes to zero and the frequency @xmath124 also goes to zero .",
    "the exterior region @xmath140 of our solution with the extremal limit fully corresponds with that of the extremal - charged black hole .",
    "the concrete construction of the non - minimal model which contains multiple quanta is important subject .",
    "this subject is technically complicated because we should solve simultaneous equations including unknown functions of the same number as the quanta .",
    "when we find the solution , we can compare the entropy of the model and that of the black hole .",
    "the subject is related with analyzing the process of the hawking radiation in the model of the black hole whose charge is much smaller than the extremal - charge",
    ".    the minimal model can not determine the red - shift parameter @xmath63 of the singularity by itself .",
    "the radiation ball model can determine the parameter @xmath63 as @xmath53 because the model derives the hawking radiation as thermal equilibrium @xcite . therefore analyzing the hawking radiation from the ball",
    "determines the parameter .",
    "we adopted the approximation of representing all of the field - fluctuations by @xmath14 kinds of the real scalar fields . according to our mean field approximation of the gravity ,",
    "only the interaction with the mean - field gravity is important .",
    "then the approximation of the scalar fields is justified .",
    "the result similar to ours is expected by more proper analysis of graviton , photon , fermion and so on .",
    "the minimal structure model has the entropy @xmath103 because the quantum in the ball belongs to one of @xmath14 kinds of fields .",
    "if we assume that the bekenstein s entropy @xmath157 in @xcite is always correct , the entropy of the ball becomes about @xmath158 and the degree of freedom @xmath159 becomes about @xmath160 . while twice of @xmath14 is similar to the degree of freedom in the standard model , the meaning of this is not clear .    * acknowledgments *    i would like to thank ofer  aharony , micha  berkooz , hiroshi  ezawa , satoshi iso , barak  kol , masao  ninomiya and kunio  yasue for useful discussions .",
