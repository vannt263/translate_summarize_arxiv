    "a question that has been asked with a certain regularity since the establishment of the first stock index is the following , see  @xcite : is it possible to calculate `` the intrinsic value of the dow '' ? or , more generally : what is the intrinsic value of wall street ?",
    "a first commonsense answer is that this value may be calculated by summing `` the intrinsic value '' of each quoted company . at the beginning of the past century , see  @xcite , it was well known that the latter depends on the expected future earnings and on the balance sheet , but unfortunately there was no easy formula , which yielded even a rough approximation",
    ". therefore aggregating all expectations for all companies quoted in the market soon appeared to be a challenging task .    between the fifties and the sixties the researchers attitude towards the problem changed radically .",
    "modern portfolio theory and the statistical evidence that stock prices follow random walks , see  @xcite , has led to the efficient market hypothesis , see  @xcite . according to this theory , financial markets are `` informationally efficient '' ,",
    "that is , one can not achieve returns in excess of average market returns on a risk - adjusted basis , given the information available at the time the investment is made .",
    "if this were the case `` the intrinsic value '' of a stock would be simply its market price and the problem would ultimately be non existent .",
    "the bubble burst in 1987 and the exceptional price boom in the late 90 lead more and more researcher to cast doubts on the hypothesis truth . at the very beginning of 2000",
    "robert shiller wrote : `` we do not know whether the market level makes any sense , or whether they are indeed the result of some human tendency that might be called irrational exuberance '' ,  @xcite , which is apparently at odds with the assumption that market prices are always fair prices .",
    "shiller s skeptical attitude was anticipated in one of the most famous books ever written on the stock market : in 1934 , graham and dodd strongly advocated the fundamental approach to investment valuation and recommended to `` shift(s ) the original point of departure , or basis of computation , from the current earnings to the average earnings , which should cover a period of not less than five years , and preferably seven to ten years ''  @xcite . since 1988",
    "campbell and shiller have been focusing their attention on average earnings as predictor of future dividends  @xcite   and future stock prices  @xcite  [ multiblock footnote omitted]the price - smoothed earnings ratio has little ability to predict future growth in smoothed earnings ; the r squared statistics are less than 4% over one year and over ten years .",
    "the ratio is a good forecaster of ten - year growth in stock prices , with an r squared statistic of 37% . ;  @xcite proposed an innovative test of the appropriateness of prices in the stock market : the cyclically adjusted price earning ratio , and showed that it is a powerful predictor of future long run performances of the market ; the performance of the test is quite satisfactory in the case of the us market from the end of 19@xmath0 century up to today .",
    "in the same years , again elaborating on  @xcite ,  @xcite suggested an alternative but similar criterion based on the assumption `` that many investors are constantly making a choice between stock and bond purchases ; as the yield on bonds advances , they would be expected to demand a correspondingly higher return on stocks , and conversely as bond yields decline  ( * ? ? ? * pag .",
    "510 ) '' ; their `` approach considers whether stocks are appropriately valued relative to analysts perceptions of future earnings and yields on alternative investments '' such as high grade corporate bonds ( for a comparison between the two approaches see  @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework which explains how future stock index returns depend on the cape ratio .",
    "this is achieved by constructing a model .",
    "what we require of our model is similar to what chiarella required in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see pag .",
    "102 )    `` firstly we require that the model generate a significant transitory component around the equilibrium which reflects the rationally expected value of the asset .",
    "secondly the model must allow for the incorporation of chartists , a group which bases its market actions on an analysis of past trends . since this group seems to be an important part of real markets it is important to determine what effect its activity has on the behaviour of asset prices and whether the behaviour of a model incorporating chartists comes closer to explaining some of the empirical results cited earlier '' .",
    "we choose , however , a different approach and we work at an aggregate level instead of explicitly modelling two different types of agents .",
    "we introduce a moment component in a `` simple error - correction model that predicts the return of the s&p based on the deviations from a presumed equilibrium between  earnings yields ''  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see pag .  3 ) and a long run target yield rate .",
    "the return growth depends on three components    * a momentum component , naturally justified in terms of agents expectation that expected returns are higher in bullish markets than in bearish ones ; * a fundamental component , proportional to a function of the level of the logarithmic averaged earnings - to - price ratio ( for brevity log ep ratio ) at time zero ; the initial time value of log ep ratio determines the reference growth level , from which the actual stock price may deviate as an effect of random external disturbances ; * a driving component ensuring the diffusive behaviour of stock prices .    under these assumptions , we are able to prove that , if we consider a sufficiently large number of periods , the expected rate of return and the expected gross return are linear in the initial time value of log ep , and their variance converges to zero with rate of convergence equal to minus one .",
    "this means that , in our model , the stock prices dynamics may generate bubbles and crashes in the short and medium run , nevertheless the averaged earnings - price ratio is a good predictor of future long - run returns , as claimed by  @xcite .",
    "the result holds for both returns and gross returns ; in the latter case we assume that the log dividend - to - price ratio follows a stationary stochastic process as in  @xcite . relaxing this assumption  @xcite",
    "have recently investigated a model where explosive bubbles may arise , while  @xcite has set forth an innovative approach to estimate the equity risk premium .    in section  [ sec : econframe ]",
    "we review the econometric issues arising in when a rate of return is regressed on a lagged stochastic regressor where the regression disturbance is correlated with the regressor s innovation . in section  [ sec : data ] we describe the data set we are going to use in the estimation of the model .",
    "section  [ sec : dynsystem ] sets up the model and derives the theoretical results .",
    "in section  [ sec : estimation ] we estimate the parameters of our model for both the standard and poor composite stock price index and the nyse / amex value weighted index , and we present the results of a monte carlo simulation , which confirms the ability of the proposed model to capture the relevant features of the historical time series .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] concludes . technical proofs are gathered in the appendix .",
    "the approach that we discuss in this paper is based on the advances achieved in recent years by different authors to deal with persistent regressions .",
    "although the methodology that we employ is of general applicability , we detail it with a specific focus on the topic of index returns predictability with respect to valuation ratios . + we refer to the real ( inflation adjusted ) price of the stock index , measured at the beginning of time period @xmath1 , with @xmath2 , while the notation @xmath3 corresponds to the real dividend paid on the portfolio during the period between @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "accordingly , we write the real log gross return on the index held from the beginning of time @xmath1 and the beginning of time @xmath4 as @xmath5 we provide a description of the return dynamics on a monthly basis .",
    "therefore , the notation @xmath4 refers to the time instant @xmath1 increased by one month and the real gross yield over a period of length @xmath6 months corresponds to @xmath7 we also introduce the index log price @xmath8 , in terms of which the gross yield can be rewritten as @xmath9 where the first term on the right hand side is equivalent to @xmath10 .",
    "the dependent variable that we study throughout the paper is the gross return of the stock index , while the regressor that we consider is the log earnings - to - price ratio ( log ep ) @xmath11 .",
    "the quantity @xmath12 refers to a moving average of real earnings over a time window of ten years . at variance with  @xcite , where the analysis is based on geometrical averages ,",
    "we employ arithmetical averages .",
    "the very reason is that in this way our study can be extended to the case of negative earnings . indeed , while it is quite unrealistic that an average over ten years results in a negative value , however it is not so uncommon to deal with spot negative earnings . in this latter case",
    "the definition of @xmath13 would be problematic .",
    "moreover , we expect that switching from one average to the other does not significantly change the overall picture .",
    "the use of an average of earnings in computing the ratios has been strongly pushed by the literature in recognition of the cyclical variability of earnings . in  @xcite",
    "the authors recommend an approach that `` shifts the original point of departure , or basis of computation , from the current earnings to the average earnings , which should cover a period of not less than five years , and preferably seven to ten years . '' + we assume that the return @xmath14 as @xmath14 . ] and the predictor satisfy the relations which follow @xmath15 where the errors @xmath16 are serially independent and identically distributed as bivariate normal , with zero mean and covariance matrix @xmath17 .",
    "we follow the same formal model of  @xcite where the time series of returns @xmath18 for @xmath19 is to be predicted by a scalar first - order autoregressive time series @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "when the regressions of the above type involve financial ratios the ordinary least - squares ( ols ) estimator for @xmath22 and @xmath23 is biased in finite samples .",
    "this problem is pointed out by many authors , see for instance  @xcite , and is analyzed by  @xcite who develops an expression for the bias of the estimated prediction coefficient . in stambaugh s words",
    "`` an assumption that typically fails to hold (  ) is that @xmath24 has zero expectation conditional on @xmath25 , and this is the assumption used to obtain finite - sample results in the standard setting . ''",
    "stated in different words , the behaviour of @xmath24 is mainly determined by the values @xmath26 and @xmath27 so @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , the dynamics of @xmath29 is strongly persistent and largely influenced by the behaviour of @xmath27 .",
    "when the log price @xmath26 increases , the idiosyncratic term @xmath24 increases too , while @xmath30 decreases ; the converse is true when the price decreases .",
    "empirically the value of @xmath31 is relatively close to one and as an overall effect this induces a strong anti - correlation between @xmath24 and @xmath30 .",
    "when both the endogeneity of the regression and the persistence of @xmath29 are taken into account the high statistical significance of the standard ols estimator , @xmath32 , found in  @xcite is to be questioned .",
    "however , starting from  @xcite , @xcite finds some evidence for predictability with valuation ratios .",
    "this result relies on the upper bound for the bias in @xmath33 which derives from the conservative assumption that the autoregressive coefficient is very close to one .",
    "we follow the alternative approach discussed in  @xcite .",
    "replacing the predictive regression  ( [ eq : regression ] ) with the augmented regression @xmath34 where @xmath35 it is possible to show that the ols estimator of @xmath36 is a low - biased estimator of the true parameter @xmath23 appearing in  ( [ eq : regression ] ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath37 and @xmath38 needed to define the regressor @xmath39 correspond to reduced - bias estimators of @xmath40 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "a possible choice for @xmath38 corresponds to the kendall s low - bias estimator of the ar(1 ) coefficient discussed in  @xcite . at variance",
    "we employ the second - order bias corrected estimator proposed in  @xcite which reads @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the standard ols estimator .",
    "coherently , the following relation holds @xmath43 with @xmath44 equal to the number of available observations .",
    "the statistical significance of @xmath23 can be tested by means of a low - bias finite sample approximation of the standard error of @xmath45 which deviates from the error provided by the ols regression .",
    "the reason for this deviation is that the ols estimate fails to take into account the additional variability of @xmath45 due to the variability of @xmath38 .",
    "unfortunately , within the same framework it seems not possible to derive an expression for the error associated with @xmath22 .",
    "testing their approach on a data sample of monthly records from the nyse inflation - adjusted value - weighted index ranging from may 1963 to december 1994 , amihud and hurvich find a highly statistically significant predictability for dividend yields . in the present paper",
    "we perform the estimation of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 coefficients exploiting the same methodology . however",
    ", as far as testing is concerned , we do not exclusively rely on the @xmath1-statistic but we resort to a bootstrap approach which does not rely on any distributional assumption for the residual components @xmath24 and @xmath30 . as we will show in section",
    "[ sec : estimation ] we find coherent results which support the forecasting ability of the logarithmic cape for both the standard and poor and nyse / amex market returns .",
    "+ before we move to the description of the bootstrap algorithm , it is worth to mention some interesting alternative results dealing with the subtle issue of predictability with valuation ratios . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the most recent advance corresponds to  @xcite which is inspired by the testing framework discussed in  @xcite .",
    "both approaches are grounded on the quasi - unit root approximation for the ar(1 ) coefficient of equation  [ eq : ar1 ] , but while the latter focuses on short - run horizons the former extends the results to arbitrary horizons .",
    "the extension to the long - run predictability involves a new element that contributes to increase the complexity of the econometric issue .",
    "indeed , long - run performances can be evaluated only aggregating returns over smaller time scales .",
    "given the intrinsic scarcity of data points , the sample can be enlarged only resorting to overlapping realizations and inducing sizable serial correlation among the residual terms .",
    "this side - effect can be managed by means of auto - correlation robust estimators , for instance those discussed in  @xcite , however , when the correlation is particularly strong , these methods show poor small sample properties as discussed in  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the new asymptotic results developed in  @xcite are based on the scaling properties of the @xmath1-statistics and are tested on a sub sample of the data used in  @xcite providing consistent results and evidence of the predictive power of the logarithmic cape .",
    "+ the bootstrap in the context of returns predictability is discussed in various papers ,  @xcite , and more specifically for regressions based on valuation ratios in  @xcite . the testing environment that we design goes through the following steps :    1 .",

    "the data set analyzed in this paper consists of records on a monthly basis of prices , earnings , and dividends for two stock price indexes for the us market .",

    "a number of recent studies suggest that variations in the earnings - to - price ratio are correlated with prospective stock market returns , ( @xmath193 ) .",
