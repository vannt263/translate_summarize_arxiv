    ", the integrated spectrum of ngc 6553 was reproduced in bruzual et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , by using isochrones and several spectral libraries ( synthetic and observed ) .",
    "the cmd of ngc 6553 was transformed into a @xmath67t@xmath10 diagram , using the t@xmath68[fe / h]@xmath11(v  i ) relations from bcp98 for all the stars , except the ones at the rgb tip .",
    "for the latter , we adopted the t@xmath58 scale derived in section 4 .",
    "for the stars below the turn - off , we adopted a salpeter imf plus the m - dwarf theoretical main sequence from baraffe et al .",
    "each star in the @xmath67t@xmath10 plane has its absolute i magnitude ( computed from distance and reddening estimated by guarnieri et al .",
    "1998 ) , and a corresponding synthetic spectrum , which is chosen to be the one with closest atmospheric parameters .",
    "the integrated synthetic spectrum is then obtained by summing up all the selected individual stellar spectra , weighted by m@xmath69 . in fig .",
    "10 the result is compared with the observed integrated spectrum of ngc 6553 , adopting [ m / h ] = 0.0 .    from the above calculations",
    ", we can estimate the contribution of stars from all evolutionary stages to the integrated light of the cluster .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "11 , where it can be seen that the few stars in the rgb tip largely dominate the cluster light in the spectral region under consideration .",
    "we note that the implementation of this grid of synthetic spectra to the code of evolutionary populations synthesis by bruzual & charlot ( 1998 ) is under way .",
    "we present a new grid of synthetic spectra in the interval @xmath2 600010200 .",
    "this grid is computed by employing state of the art model atmospheres and has a higher resolution than the ones currently in use in stellar population synthesis in the same spectral interval .    a fit to nir spectra of stars from the rgb tip of ngc 6553 enabled us to derive a t@xmath10 scale for the m giants , based on the tio @xmath3 system band intensities , on the one hand , and also to determine a set of semi - empirical electronic oscillator strengths for the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 systems of the tio molecule .",
    "the adequacy of our spectral library for stellar population synthesis purposes was tested for the case of ngc 6553 , a well studied bulge globular cluster , for which detailed abundance analyses of individual stars and well - defined cmds are available . in this framework",
    ", we obtained a good match to the ised of this cluster .",
