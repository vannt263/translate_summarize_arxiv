    "by the autoresonance is meant the growth of the amplitude of oscillations of a solution to a nonlinear equation under action of an external oscillating force .",
    "this phenomenon looks like phase locking of a nonlinear oscillator through a periodic driver .",
    "the phase locking was first suggested to accelerate relativistic particles , see @xcite . nowadays",
    "the autoresonance is thought of as universal phenomenon which occurs in a wide range of oscillating physical systems from astronomical to atomic ones @xcite .    in the general case",
    "the frequency of a nonlinear oscillator depends on the amplitude of oscillations or , what is the same , on their energy .",
    "hence , in order to change the energy of a nonlinear oscillator the frequency of the external force should be adopted to that of the oscillator .",
    "if the force is small then the energy of oscillations changes slowly . in order to remain resonant",
    ", the frequency of the external force should adopt itself also slowly to the frequency of the nonlinear oscillator .",
    "moreover , the backward phenomenon proves to occur .",
    "namely , the slow change of the frequency of the driver results in that the frequency of the nonlinear oscillator actually follows the driver frequency . for a contemporary survey of the mathematical aspects of autoresonance",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the autoresonance phenomenon in systems with dissipation was earlier studied both by means of mathematical models and in physical experiments . in particular , the existence of autoresonant solution for the system of three coupled oscillators with small dissipation was established in @xcite and for the system with parametric autoresonance in @xcite . in the papers @xcite the threshold of capture into autoresonance",
    "was discussed in the presence of dissipation .",
    "the resonant phase locking phenomenon in van der pol duffing s equation with external driver of slowly varying frequency was studied in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we treat two problems for autoresonance in dissipative systems for the time being open .",
    "firstly we prove the existence of an attracting set for solution trajectories captured into autoresonance .",
    "such attracting set was observed numerically in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "the attractor in these systems is a slowly varying steady state solution .",
    "the solutions captured into autoresonance oscillate around such a solution and lose the energy of oscillations because of dissipation .",
    "therefore , all captured solutions tend to the steady state solution .",
    "mathematically this means that the slowly varying steady state solution is lyapunov stable .",
    "the second problem we deal with consists in evaluating the bound of the autoresonant growth of solution in the presence of small dissipation in the system .",
    "earlier one observed that the amplitude growth of nonlinear oscillations in systems with dissipation is bounded , see @xcite .",
    "> from physical viewpoint the boundedness of autoresonant growth can be easily explained .",
    "namely , the work of driver is proportional to the length of trajectory in the phase space .",
    "if the disspation depends linearly on the velocity then its work is proportional to the area described by the phase trajectory . under the growth of energy",
    "the area of the phase curve grows faster than its length .",
    "it follows that even if the dissipation is small , its work exceeds the work of external force at some moment and the autoresonant growth of solution stops .",
    "mathematically this looks like the impossibility of extension of the solution under phase capture .",
    "what happens is the hard loss of stability and passage to fast oscillations .",
    "this work is aimed at finding an asymptotic expansion for the slowly varying steady state solution to the primary resonance equation and at showing that it is an attracting set for those solutions which are captured into the resonance .",
    "moreover , we derive asymptotics for the maximal amplitude of oscillations under autoresonance with small dissipation and calculate the period of the autoresonant mode in the solution .",
    "the paper contains seven sections . in the next section [ s.sotp ]",
    "we describe mathematical setting of the problem .",
    "section [ s.rotp ] provides a detailed exposition of the main results .",
    "section [ s.aoag ] deals with asymptotics for the autoresonant mode . in section [ s.soag ]",
    "we discuss the stability of autoresonant growth . in section [ s.voboag ]",
    "we study the solution behaviour in the vicinity of the break of autoresonant growth . in section [ s.boag ]",
    "we will look more closely at the break of autoresonant growth .",
    "section [ s.fm ] is concerned with passage from monotone autoresonant growth of the amplitude of nonlinear oscillations to fast motion solutions .",
    "we study solution of the primary resonance equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an independent variable , @xmath2 a dissipation parameter and @xmath3 is a parameter related to the amplitude of external force .",
    "the primary resonance equation is of universal character in mathematical description of autoresonance . in the case @xmath4 it was first introduced in the paper @xcite .",
    "the primary resonance equation describes long - term evolution of nonlinear oscillations under action of a small external force . as but one example we mention duffing s equation with dissipation @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are constants , @xmath8 and @xmath9 small positive parameters .",
    "the frequency of oscillations of the right - hand side of the equation depends linearly on the time .",
    "more precisely , @xmath10 which is usually referred to as a chirped frequency .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 ( called a chirp rate ) determines the rate of change of the frequency .",
    "duffing s equation ( [ duffing ] ) proves to be the simplest and so the most general equation where one observes the phenomenon of autoresonance break because of small dissipation .    for studying autoresonance",
    "it is convenient to use the method of two scales .",
    "the oscillations of the nonlinear equation are observed in the time scale @xmath12 .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations depends in turn on the slow time @xmath13 .",
    "the introduction of two time scales enables one to split the evolution of solution into two parts , fast and slow ones , using the asymptotic substitution @xmath14 in equation ( [ duffing ] ) .",
    "the standard averaging procedure over the fast time @xmath12 in the leading - order term in @xmath9 leads to equation ( [ pr ] ) for the unknown function @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this primary resonance equation is often written as the system of equations for the amplitude @xmath19 and the phase @xmath20 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath21 cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the autoresonance or phase locking for the solution of system ( [ spr ] ) means that @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "this condition along with the second equation of system ( [ spr ] ) determine a low for the amplitude growth which reads @xmath24 .",
    "the first equation of ( [ spr ] ) gives a sufficient condition for the instant at which the phase locking is destroyed , namely @xmath25 .",
    "analysis of the equation and phase locking condition actually yield an estimate of autoresonance growth in a dissipative system with small dissipation , @xmath26 , see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we construct asymptotics for the slowly varying steady state solution of equation ( [ spr ] ) with @xmath26 .",
    "we prove that this solution is an attracting set for the captured solutions .",
    "moreover , we show asymptotics of the maximal value of @xmath27 and evaluate the instant at which the phase locking is destroyed .    in order to better motivate the problem",
    ", we demonstrate results of numerical simulations for equation ( [ pr ] ) with @xmath28 . in figure  [ fig0 ]",
    "one can observe three stages of evolution for the solution of ( [ pr ] ) . at the first stage the oscillations are close to some smooth curve . then",
    ", at the second stage the solution varies slowly .",
    "finally , at the third stage the solution loses its stability and the amplitude of fast oscillations tends to zero .    the autoresonant growth and rapid decay of the amplitude of @xmath15 are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .    ) with parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 and the initial condition @xmath31.,width=283 ]    ) with parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 and the initial condition @xmath31.,width=283 ]",
    "to formulate the results it is convenient to change both the independent and dependent variables by @xmath32 the equation for @xmath33 takes the form @xmath34 denote @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the existence time for the autoresonant mode in the solution of ( [ pr ] ) is evaluated by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the first real pole of the painlev-1 transcendental with zero monodromy data @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , the maximal amplitude is estimated by @xmath42    we are now able to give an explicit description of asymptotics for the autoresonant solution which is an attracting set for the solutions captured into autoresonance .",
    "if @xmath43 then @xmath27 and @xmath44 behave like @xmath45    to write the asymptotics in a neighbourhood of @xmath46 , we change the variables by @xmath47 the functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 have the form @xmath50 the representations being valid if @xmath51 .",
    "close to @xmath52 it is convenient to represent the asymptotics in the form @xmath53 in this domain the autoresonant mode of the solution loses its stability .",
    "the leading - order term of @xmath54 relative to @xmath2 admits the representation @xmath55 where @xmath41 is the painlev-1 transcendental , see @xcite , i.e. , a special solution of the painlev-1 equation @xmath56 with asymptotics @xmath57 the asymptotic formula for @xmath58 looks like @xmath59 as @xmath60",
    ".    the painlev-1 transcendental @xmath41 has poles on the real axis .",
    "the approximate solution of ( [ pr ] ) by means of @xmath41 is valid up to a small neighbourhood of the first @xmath40 of these poles or , what is the same , up to @xmath61 . near the pole",
    "the validity domain is determined by the inequality @xmath62    the asymptotics of the solution of ( [ pr ] ) in a neighbourhood of the pole represents by fast non - autoresonant oscillations in the new scale of variable @xmath63 .",

    "the function @xmath69 is determined from the equation @xmath70 note that the function @xmath65 depends on a parameter @xmath71 which tends to @xmath72 as @xmath73 .",
    "in this section we construct an asymptotic solution to ( [ perturbedpr ] ) in the domain @xmath43 and @xmath37 . to this end",
    "we introduce new unknown functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 related to the amplitude @xmath27 and phase @xmath44 of the unknown function @xmath33 by @xmath76 on substituting these formulas into ( [ perturbedpr ] ) and separating the real and imaginary parts of the equation we get @xmath77    assuming @xmath2 to be small , we look for a solution @xmath78 , @xmath11 in the form of asymptotic series @xmath79    we first derive equations to determine the coefficients of these asymptotic series . for this purpose",
    "we substitute ( [ series1 ] ) into equations ( [ eq - rho - alpha ] ) .",
    "the trigonometric functions in these equations are expanded as taylor series in a neighbourhood of some point @xmath80 .",
    "then we equate the coefficients of the same powers of parameter @xmath2 . as a result",
    "we get a recurrent sequence of triangle systems of linear equations for the unknown coefficients of ( [ series1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , for the leading - order terms of series we obtain @xmath81 which gives @xmath82 and @xmath80 .    on equating the coefficients of @xmath2 we arrive at the system @xmath83 which readily yields @xmath84 and @xmath85 by @xmath86 on equating the coefficients of @xmath87 we get the system @xmath88",

    "it follows that the constructed asymptotic expansion is valid for @xmath99 .",
    "we will look for a solution which is a partial sum of the asymptotic series constructed above , up to remainders @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "namely , we consider @xmath102 where @xmath38 and @xmath103 is the fast variable",

    "an easy computation yields the system of equations @xmath106    the right - hand side of the system has coefficients slowly varying in the fast variable @xmath107 .",
    "solutions of such systems are usually constructed by the wkb method , see for instance @xcite .",
