    "this sample was placed in a static magnetic field @xmath64 of approximately @xmath65 t , aligned along the @xmath3-axis direction .",
    "the chloroform molecule has two nuclei ( hydrogen and carbon ) with nuclear spins equal to 1/2 , which interact with each other via exchange interaction . for liquid , isotropic samples with weak coupling , the dynamics of the system",
    "is well described by the hamiltonian @xmath66    under the static field the nuclei larmor frequencies are @xmath67 and @xmath68 , while their coupling constant is @xmath69 .",

    "as the nuclear larmor frequencies are far from each other , a quasi - squared short pulse could be used .",

    "one is capable of increasing the decoherence process experienced by both nuclei on demand .",
    "indeed , under such a condition the nuclei larmor frequencies become @xmath88position dependent , imposing different spin precessions and therefore enhancing the dephasing observed in the system dynamics ( [ hnmr ] ) .",

    "roughly speaking , the nuclei spin precession of the molecules in the sample produce an oscillating magnetic field which is attenuated by the thermalization processes discussed above .",

    "<S> we performed a banged - digital - analog simulation of a quantum annealing protocol in a two - qubit nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) quantum computer . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental simulation employed up to 235 trotter steps , with more than 2000 gates ( pulses ) , and we obtained a protocol success above 80% . given the exquisite control of the nmr quantum computer , we performed the simulation with different noise levels . </S>",
    "<S> we thus analyzed the reliability of the quantum annealing process , and related it to the level of entanglement produced during the protocol . </S>",
    "<S> although the presence of entanglement is not a sufficient signature for a better - than - classical simulation , the level of entanglement achieved relates to the fidelity of the protocol .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction . </S>",
    "<S> _ among the models for quantum computation , quantum annealing arises as one of the front runners that may first establish the quantum supremacy  </S>",
    "<S> the stage at which implementations of quantum computers will start solving problems deemed intractable for their classical counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> such a model is inspired on the adiabatic quantum computation ( aqc ) scheme , originally proposed by farhi et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in which the answer of an abstract problem can be encoded in the ground state of a physical system . </S>",
    "<S> similarly to aqc , quantum annealing exploits the gradual modification of the system state character , in order to find the solution of a hard problem starting from an easy one . </S>",
    "<S> however , regarding its physical implementation , quantum annealing presents a key advantage , since it is tailored for scenarios in which the system is in contact with a thermal environment  due to this interaction , under appropriated conditions , relaxation processes to the ground state may enhance the protocol success . because of that </S>",
    "<S> , and due to its simplicity , quantum annealing has attracted great attention . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it was adopted as the quantum computation model by d - wave  @xcite  the first company commercially producing and selling devices advertised as quantum computers . </S>",
    "<S> this first private venture was recently followed by an initiative from google / ucsb  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> all that led to an increased scrutiny of the model . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> soon after the announcement of d - wave s first machine , took place an important and intense debate whether their computer would be actually a quantum computer . even though the first evidences indicated that quantum annealing would be the right model for the machine s behavior  @xcite , they were taken as disputable , as semi - classical approaches could also reasonably describe the experimental results  @xcite , and no evidence of speed - up was found  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in such a debate , naturally , the `` holy grail '' became whether the machine could generate entanglement during the computation . </S>",
    "<S> recently d - wave conducted an experiment that unequivocally showed the presence of entanglement among the qubits composing one of their first processors  @xcite . having settled that issue , other questions became natural and pertinent .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this contribution is twofold : _ </S>",
    "<S> i ) to assess the reliability of a quantum annealing simulation under a massive `` banged - digital - analog '' quantum computation . _ </S>",
    "<S> recently , a only - digital simulation of the quantum annealing process was performed  @xcite in a system composed of nine superconducting qubits . due to their system size and the noise acting on it </S>",
    "<S> , they were able to perform only few ( five ) trotter steps , and , for the ferromagnetic chain problem with 4 spins , the fidelity obtained was @xmath0 . to overcome some of the issues encountered in this implementation , here we combine the digital simulation with an analog part . </S>",
    "<S> digital - analog quantum simulations have been proposed to different architectures  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a scheme might potentially lead quantum annealing to inherit features , like designing interactions on demand and error correction protocols , from digital quantum computing  @xcite . _ </S>",
    "<S> ii ) to relate the amount of entanglement generated during a quantum annealing protocol with its success . _ </S>",
    "<S> the role of entanglement is one of the most unclear questions concerning aqc . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that , once fixed an annealing schedule , its fidelity shall be related to the amount of entanglement created during the protocol . therefore , only high levels of entanglement , i.e. , extreme experimental control of noise sources , might guarantee a better - than - classical result . in order to tackle these issues , </S>",
    "<S> here we employed a two - qubit nmr quantum processor to perform the banged - digital - analog quantum computation . in nmr </S>",
    "<S> the interaction among the nuclear spins , which are the qubits of the processor , is always on , performing the analog part of the computation . besides that </S>",
    "<S> , one can shine the system with radio frequency ( rf- ) pulses to perform banged - digital single qubit gates . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the amount of entanglement generated in the protocol can be changed by a tunable source of decoherence .    _ </S>",
    "<S> the computational problem . _ </S>",
    "<S> the task we analyse here is that of finding the ground state of an ising spin glass model , defined by the hamiltonian : @xmath1 in this expression , @xmath2 is the usual @xmath3 component of a spin-1/2 operator at site @xmath4 , and the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent local fields and spin - spin couplings , respectively . besides being a paradigm for many - body quantum systems , the problem of finding its ground state </S>",
    "<S> is known to be representative of several optimization problems ( np - hard )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that if we define the eigenvectors of @xmath7 by @xmath8 with @xmath9 , then the ground state of the ising hamiltonian is certainly a product state of the form @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the challenge is to determine which of the @xmath11 possible product states of this form is the actual ground state . a task for which brute force search clearly will not be efficient .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantum annealing strategy to approach this problem relies on the quantum adiabatic theorem  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , one initializes the system in the ground state of a simple hamiltonian , @xmath12 . here </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , which ground state is @xmath15 , with @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the initial state is an equiprobable superposition of all @xmath11 possible product states @xmath10 that can be the ground state of @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> second , a `` schedule '' is chosen such that the system hamiltonian is adiabatically changed onto the ising hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the system is governed by the time - dependent hamiltonian : h(t)=(t)h_easy+(t ) _ i=1^n h_i_i^z + ( t)_i < j=1^nj_ij_i^z_j^z , [ eq : timeh ] where the envelope functions @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are changed smoothly during the protocol , @xmath21 $ ] , and are such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 , what ensures the appropriate initial and final conditions . </S>",
    "<S> if these conditions are met , then the quantum adiabatic theorem guarantees that the final state of the system is the ground state of @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noticing that , as for @xmath24 the spins are interacting and @xmath25\\neq0 $ ] , thus it is expected that some entanglement will be generated during this process .    </S>",
    "<S> naturally , any physical implementation of the quantum annealing protocol must run in a finite time , and is under the influence of a thermal environment . </S>",
    "<S> the finitude of the protocol duration implies that the adiabaticity condition is somewhat broken , and the state at each time is a superposition of a large component of the ground state and small parts of the first excited states . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if the protocol is slow enough and the system and the environment are weakly coupled , the thermal environment turns this superposition into a mixture of such eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> these two unavoidable facts , in general , result in errors for the quantum annealer . </S>",
    "<S> however , since we are searching for the ground state of the problem hamiltonian , for low temperatures the thermalization process might help transferring population from the excited states to the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> this possible improvement of the quantum annealer comes at the cost of keeping the temperature low , and of waiting for the relaxation process to happen .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we address the robustness of the quantum annealer in such realistic conditions  fixing the running time for different noise strengths  and we compare the quality of its results with the ones obtained by a classical simulation . in the classical simulation here employed , we model each spin as a magnet compass , with magnetization pointing at the direction @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> . the magnetization components of each qubit evolve accordingly to the noise - free bloch s equations : this set of @xmath27 coupled differential equations can be easily solved by a classical computer . </S>",
    "<S> we say that the state of the system at time @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 , with the state of each qubit defined by magnetization components through @xmath30 for @xmath31 . in this classical model </S>",
    "<S> there is clearly no entanglement during the whole evolution . as such </S>",
    "<S> we expect that this simulation will fail during the time intervals where the quantum annealing process produces some entanglement . as a last remark , </S>",
    "<S> since this is a simulation performed in a classical computer , we do not include any noise effects . </S>",
    "<S> the state assigned to the system remains always pure .    _ </S>",
    "<S> nmr experiment . </S>",
    "<S> _ in order to address the reliability of a quantum annealing process in controlled laboratory conditions , we conducted an experiment of a small - scale quantum annealer within the framework of nuclear - magnetic resonance ( nmr ) . </S>",
    "<S> nmr is a well established test bed for quantum information processing , allowing for an exquisite control of the nuclear spins of molecules . </S>",
    "<S> our experiment was performed using a sample of carbon - enriched chloroform ( chcl@xmath32 ) molecules , where the nuclear spins of the hydrogen and the carbon were taken as physical implementations of qubits . </S>",
    "<S> for that , a static magnetic field of @xmath33 was applied to the sample along the @xmath3 direction , yielding @xmath34 and @xmath35 as the hydrogen and carbon larmor frequencies , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the sample contains around @xmath36 identical chloroform molecules highly diluted in deutered acetone , thus intermolecular interactions can be safely ignored . </S>",
    "<S> such conditions lead to the natural nmr system hamiltonian : h_nmr = -_h -_c + 2j , [ eq : hnmr ] with the interaction strength between the two spins given by the coupling constant @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> single qubit operations are performed in a straightforward manner by applying radio frequency pulses with specific field polarizations , tuned in resonance with each one of the spins . however , since pulses and read - out act collectively , it is not possible to address each molecule individually , meaning that only average properties of the sample are measured  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another consequence of such a lack of spatial resolution is that a magnetic field gradient along the @xmath3 direction acts as a dephasing channel for the computational basis . given that the strength of this process is determined by the gradient intensity , one has an effective _ knob _ to adjust the noise level in this setup . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , as the system s hamiltonian is not diagonal in that basis , eigenenergy transitions may also be induced by the presence of such magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we exploit this tool to assess the connection between different levels of entanglement and the fidelity of the noisy computation .    </S>",
    "<S> our quantum annealer is then comprised of two qubits and its time evolution is simulated experimentally using the natural ( analog ) nmr hamiltonian   and an appropriate ( digital ) sequence of pulses . </S>",
    "<S> for that , we first divided ( trotterization ) the total evolution generated by the time - dependent hamiltonian   into 235 time steps @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , such that @xmath40 . in this way we can write the evolution operator as @xmath41 , with each evolution block @xmath42 determined numerically . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , each @xmath42 is translated into a sequence of pulses and free system evolution ( see figure  [ fig : simulation ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the time intervals @xmath38 are not necessarily equal , and their choice take into account how fast the hamiltonian changes during each block . </S>",
    "<S> such an approach is necessary because there exists a trade - off between the minimization of the number of pulses and the fidelity obtained for the time evolution . </S>",
    "<S> pulses angles and the free evolution time interval were chosen as to minimize the ( hilbert - schmidt ) distance between @xmath42 and the implemented transformation . </S>",
    "<S> more details can be found in the supplementary material .    . </S>",
    "<S> each evolution block @xmath42 is implemented using free evolution and an appropriate @xmath3 and @xmath43 polarized rf - pulses applied to each qubit . </S>",
    "<S> the respective pulses angles @xmath44 and free evolution duration @xmath45 are chosen as to maximize the fidelity of the operation with @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : simulation ] ]    here , we choose to experimentally search for the ground state of two instances of the ising hamiltonian   with parameters @xmath46 for the qubit encoded in the hydrogen nuclear spin , and @xmath47 for the qubit encoded in the carbon nuclear spin . </S>",
    "<S> the instances differ from each other only by the sign of spin - spin coupling @xmath48 , which absolute value is chosen to be @xmath49 . taking @xmath50 makes the ground state of @xmath17 unique and separable , as any possible degeneracy is lifted . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath12 we take @xmath51 and @xmath52 . hence , any entanglement created during the time evolution is due to the adiabatic algorithm . with these choices , the total time for the simulated protocol was fixed in @xmath53 with scheduling [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup](a ) ] selected in such a way that no level - crossing involving the ground state is present . in an ideal , noiseless and error - free realization of this protocol </S>",
    "<S> , fidelities between the time - evolved state and the instantaneous ground state would remain above 0.997 during the whole process , reaching @xmath54 at the end of the protocol . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in this scenario , the quantum annealer would always be better than the classical simulation described above , as may be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup](b ) . also note , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup](c ) , that when @xmath55 and the spin - spin coupling hamiltonian @xmath56 are comparable , the instantaneous time - evolved state would exhibit a fair amount of entanglement .    . </S>",

    "<S> ( c ) entanglement evolution . * the evolution of entanglement , as measured by its negativity , in the time - evolved state . </S>",
    "<S> high amounts of entanglement are obtained when the contributions of @xmath12 and @xmath17 are comparable . ]    with the experiment design fixed ( scheduling and optimized @xmath42 s ) , our nmr implementation obeys the following structure : _ a ) _ we initialize the system in the ( pseudo - pure ) state @xmath58 ; _ b ) _ switch on the field gradient ; _ c ) _ apply a sequence of pulses leading to the evolution @xmath59 , up to a sequence with @xmath60 ; _ d ) _ switch off the field gradient ; _ e ) _ perform full - state tomography . </S>",

    "<S> part of the results are shown in the fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results ] . as expected , the fidelity ( open squares ) between the experimentally produced state and the ground state is near unity at the beginning of the experiment for all values of the gradient . as the protocol continues , fidelity decreases due to intrinsic errors and also due to the induced noise by the field gradient . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the greater the gradient , the worse the fidelity gets . </S>",
    "<S> such a behavior is also observed when one looks at the fidelity of states considering only the population occupation of the computational basis ( diagonal part of the state density matrix in the computational basis ) , what we called `` success '' . </S>",
    "<S> this figure of merit is pertinent for experiments where measurements can only be performed in the computational basis . </S>",
    "<S> notice that towards the end of the protocol , both success and fidelity reach the same value . </S>",
    "<S> this happens because the off - diagonal terms of the experimental state dye out due to the decoherence , and the ground state is diagonal in the computational basis .     ]    </S>",
    "<S> we can also observe how the amount of entanglement evolves with time , and its resilience to noise . </S>",
    "<S> the top panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results ] , where no gradient is present , is to be compared with fig.[fig : setup](c ) . as discussed before , when both the transversal and longitudinal components of the time - dependent hamiltonian are present , a higher amount of entanglement is generated . </S>",
    "<S> as we increase the noise strength , i.e. , the field gradient , the amount of entanglement created during the protocol greatly reduces . </S>",
    "<S> these two facts above suggest a correlation between the amount of entanglement generated during the quantum annealing protocol and the overall quality of the process . to make this correlation clearer , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : avg ] we plot the time - average fidelity and success for the quantum annealer as a function of the field gradient , and also the time - averaged entanglement and the maximum achieved entanglement as a function of the field gradient . </S>",
    "<S> the curves are monotonically related to each other .    </S>",
    "<S> naturally , the inference of such a correlation between the entanglement generated and the quality of the process poses perhaps a more important question regarding quantum computation : would the presence of entanglement be a signature of a better than classical computation ? to address this question , </S>",
    "<S> we also plot in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : avg ] the time - average fidelity and success for the classical simulation . as the ground state of @xmath62 </S>",
    "<S> is entangled at some times , and the states produced by the classical algorithm are always separable , the time averaged fidelity and success can never be one . nevertheless , as the classical simulation does not suffer from noise , </S>",
    "<S> its quality is the same for all values of the gradient . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus expected that for a given level of noise the quantum fidelity and success should be below the classical counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , however , this crossing happens despite the fact that considerable amounts of entanglement are generated by the quantum annealer . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that producing entanglement in a quantum annealing process does not necessarily mean that the quantum computation is more reliable than any classical simulation .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> _ our results , obtained from an nmr quantum annealer , provide clear evidences that entanglement should not be considered the figure of merit to assert that a quantum annealing computation would be more reliable than any classical computation , even though a correlation between high amounts of entanglement and better quantum computation seems to exist . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , as for the context of digital - analog adiabatic quantum computing , our results also reinforce that such an approach should be indeed considered as a viable and promising implementation of continuous time evolutions </S>",
