    "monochromatic electromagnetic waves are typically characterized by their intensity , frequency , and the state of polarization , with the first two characteristics being easy to assess using suitable detectors and spectrometers .",
    "the state of polarization , on the other hand , is an inherently tricky problem to experimentally probe , since the phase information between orthogonal polarization states is completely lost in the conventional detection process ( sensitive only to the light intensity or power ) . as such , the determination of the polarization typically necessitates a series of measurements with properly arranged polarizers consecutively placed in front of the detector , allowing one to eventually obtain the stokes parameters that , similar to the ellipsometric parameters , fully describe the state of polarization@xcite . as a way to measure the state of polarization in one shot ,",
    "it is possible to parallelize the measurement process by splitting the incident beam into several beams and using multiple polarizers and detectors@xcite , although such an approach increases the size and complexity of the optical system . despite the inconvenience in determining the polarization , it is in most applications of paramount importance to know this parameter since light - matter interactions are , in general , polarization - dependent . as archetypical examples , we mention plane wave reflection and transmission at material interfaces in which the fresnel coefficients are different for orthogonal polarizations , and antennas that dominantly emit ( or respond to ) a specific polarization component",
    ". moreover , polarimetry , which represents a branch of science that extracts information from the measurement of a probe signal s resulting polarization state , covers as diverse areas as thin film characterization@xcite ( i.e. , ellipsometry ) , astronomy@xcite , and biology@xcite .",
    "consequently , it is clear that a simple , fast , and compact way of measuring the state of polarization is a desirable feature in a broad range of applications . in the reverse situation of synthesizing an arbitrary polarization ,",
    "recent progress has been conducted at the telecom wavelength by utilizing silicon - on - insulator waveguides combined with an out - coupling nanoantenna@xcite , while suggestions of extending the principle to arbitrary polarization detection have also been expressed@xcite .    in the context of polarization - dependent light - matter interaction ,",
    "it is appropriate to discuss the recent advances with carefully designed plasmonic ( i.e. , metallic ) metasurfaces .",
    "metasurfaces are characterized by a subwavelength thickness in the direction of beam propagation , while the transverse plane consists of an array of metallic particles with subwavelength periodicity@xcite . accordingly",
    ", incident light does not resolve the fine - structure of the metasurface and it can , for this reason , be considered as an effective interface discontinuity that may control both the amplitude and phase of the reflected and/or transmitted light .",
    "particularly , early work has considered transmission through a space - variant metal - stripe metasurface@xcite , which results in part of the incident light being redirected ( i.e. , diffracted ) , similar to the functionality of blazed gratings@xcite . moreover , the response of the metasurface is partially polarization - dependent and , consequently , it can be used as part of an optical system for probing the state of polarization of the incident light . for example , by combining the metasurface with a linear polarizer and performing two successive measurements@xcite or , alternatively , by fourier transforming the transmitted near - field when a quater - wave plate is placed in front of the metasurface @xcite , it is possible to determine the stokes parameters .    in recent years , considerably amount of work has been devoted to realizing planar optical components , like wave plates@xcite , lenses@xcite and gratings@xcite , that typically either manipulate the state of polarization , propagation direction , or wave front of the incident light . for efficient manipulation of light , however , it is advantageous to consider configurations based on the low - frequency concept of reflectarrays@xcite , also known in the optical regime as gap - surface plasmon ( gsp ) based metasurfaces@xcite due to the physical origin of the plasmonic resonances@xcite .",
    "these metasurfaces consist of an optically - thick metal film overlaid by a nanometer - thin dielectric spacer and an array of space - variant metal nanobricks ( sometimes also denoted nanopatches ) .",
    "the gradient metasurface only operates in reflection , but it has the advantage of being simple to fabricate ( i.e. , one - step of electron beam lithography ) and ( in the limit of negligible ohmic losses ) the potential to manipulate light with 100% efficiency . here , it is important to stress that the high efficiency is not only limited to linear polarization states@xcite , but also includes circularly polarized light@xcite .",
    "the design principles are , however , slightly different . for linearly polarized light , the @xmath0 phase control of the reflected light is reached by choosing ( at the design wavelength ) nanobrick dimensions at and near the fundamental gsp resonance , while appropriately selecting other geometrical parameters so that the metasurface remains highly reflective even at the resonance@xcite . for circularly polarized light ,",
    "on the other hand , the phase gradient is geometrically induced by spatially varying the orientation of the identical nanobricks , hereby leading to a so - called pancharatnam - berry phase@xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is important to notice that circularly polarized light of opposite handedness will by symmetry considerations always experience geometrically - induced phase gradients of opposite sign , meaning that the two orthogonal polarization states are split when reflected by the metasurface@xcite .",
    "in contrast , birefringent metasurfaces manipulating linear polarization states must be carefully designed to obtain a similar polarization - splitting functionality@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we first highlight the equivalence between the stokes parameters and diffraction contrasts in three types of phase - gradient birefringent metasurfaces , where each metasurface functions as a polarization - splitter for a certain polarization basis .",
    "gsp - based metasurfaces are then designed at a wavelength of 800 nm , while their functionalities are verified both numerically and experimentally .",
    "finally , we interweave the three metasurfaces into a so - called metagrating that allow us , without the need of any additional polarizers , to determine the state of polarization of the incident light by simultaneously measuring the associated six diffraction intensities . as such , this work proposes a new compact optical component that allows for fast and simple determination of the state of polarization .",
    "let us start by considering a monochromatic plane wave propagating along the @xmath1-direction with the amplitude of the electric field defined ( in cartesian coordinates ) by the jones vector @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are real - valued positive constants and @xmath5 is the phase difference between the two components . it should be noted that @xmath6 contains all the information about the intensity and polarization of the plane wave and , hence , constitutes a crucial parameter in any optical system .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that optoelectronic detectors only measure intensities complicates the experimental determination of @xmath6 since @xmath5 can not be directly measured .",
    "instead , one can make a set of measurements in which light transverses specifically oriented polarizers before reaching the detector , hereby allowing one to determine the stokes parameters @xmath7 it is clear that @xmath8 is proportional to the intensity , @xmath9 , of the beam , whereas @xmath10-@xmath11 describe the state of polarization .",
    "importantly , the latter three stokes parameters can be found by measuring the respective intensities of the two components in the orthonormal bases @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . here , @xmath15 corresponds to a rotation of the cartesian coordinate system @xmath12 by @xmath16 with respect to the @xmath17-axis , while @xmath18 is the basis for right- and left - circularly polarized light . note that @xmath19 normalized by @xmath8 attain the maximum values of @xmath20 for light being polarized in accordance with the respective coordinate axes .",

    "we now make the crucial point that splitting of orthogonal polarizations is not limited to the @xmath12 basis , but the implementation of the _ diagonal _ reflection matrix in for _ any _ basis results in diffractive splitting of the associated orthogonal polarizations . a simple spatial fourier transform of the reflected field in the basis ( @xmath26 ) shows that the intensities in the @xmath25 diffraction orders are @xmath27 with the diffraction contrast defined by @xmath28 it is evident that the diffraction contrast is _ equal _ to @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) for the bases @xmath12 , @xmath15 , and @xmath18 , respectively . as such , we can construct an all - polarization sensitive metagrating that consists of three parts , each implementing for one of the three bases , while the associated diffraction contrasts correspond to the normalized stokes parameters .      in the design of the birefringent gsp - based metasurfaces , we first consider a gold - glass - gold configuration with no phase gradient and light incident normally to the surface [ fig .",

    "the polarization state of the incident light is controlled by a polarizer ( p ) and waveplate ( wp2 ) , where wp2 is a quarter - wave plate or half - wave plate .",
    "wp1 is an additional wave plate which together with p control the laser power incident on the sample .",
    "once the polarization state is fixed , the light is weakly focused by a lens ( l1 ) onto the metasurface with a spot diameter larger than the metasurface .",
    "the reflected light is collected by a long - working distance objective with numerical aperture 0.55 whose front focal plane ( ffp ) is coinciding with the metasurface .",
    "note that in order to collect the reflected light , a beam splitter ( bs2 ) is inserted between the objective and the metasurface . in order to compensate for the phase change between orthogonally polarized light induced by bs2 we insert an additional beam splitter ( bs1 ) rotated by @xmath56 w.r.t .",

    "the metasurface diffraction pattern is finally obtained by projecting the objective back focal plane ( bfp ) by another lens ( l2 ) onto a cmos camera which for sufficiently low optical power can be operated with a linear response .",
    "it should be noted that the non - ideal performance of the different optical components , particularly the broadband quarter - wave plate , and possible imperfections in the alignment implies an overall uncertainty in the state of polarization of the incident beam that is estimated to be @xmath57% .     in each panel .",

    "we ascribe this deviation to the above mentioned fabrication imperfections and uncertainties in material properties with respect to the theoretical design , along with the uncertainty in the incident polarization state .",
    "having experimentally verified the functionality of the designed metasurfaces , we now construct an all - polarization sensitive _ metagrating _ by interweaving the three metasurfaces . as a first thought",

    ", we could instead allow the metagrating to consist of three @xmath64m - scale blocks each representing one of the three metasurface , although such a design would require a certain size and homogeneity of the incoming beam .",
    "for the above - mentioned reasons , we realize the metagrating by interweaving the three metasurfaces in pairs of four super cells along the @xmath24-direction [ fig . [",

    "<S> measuring light s state of polarization is an inherently difficult problem , since the phase information between orthogonal polarization states is typically lost in the detection process . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we bring to the fore the equivalence between normalized stokes parameters and diffraction contrasts in appropriately designed phase - gradient birefringent metasurfaces and introduce a concept of all - polarization birefringent metagratings . </S>",
    "<S> the metagrating , which consists of three interweaved metasurfaces , allows one to easily analyze an arbitrary state of light polarization by conducting simultaneous ( i.e. , parallel ) measurements of the correspondent diffraction intensities that reveal immediately the stokes parameters of the polarization state under examination . </S>",
    "<S> based on plasmonic metasurfaces operating in reflection at the wavelength of 800 nm , we design and realize phase - gradient birefringent metasurfaces and the correspondent metagrating , while experimental characterization of the fabricated components convincingly demonstrates the expected functionalities . </S>",
    "<S> we foresee the use of the metagrating in compact polarimetric setups at any frequency regime of interest . </S>"
