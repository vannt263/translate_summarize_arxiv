    "the manipulation of quantum systems in an entangled state that can be used as a quantum information channel is one of the main challenges of science today .",
    "information theory , teleportation and cryptography are just some of the areas that may advance enormously through the amount of technological applications which can potentially make use of entanglement .",
    "@xcite it is also of great interest to explore the role played by entanglement systems in order to understand the basis of quantum mechanics .",
    "@xcite however , even the quantification of entanglement remains an open question .",
    "current researche is focusing on measures for precisely quantifying entanglement .",
    "@xcite as an example , entanglement of indistinguishable particles calculated using different measures has shown that a same quantum state can have several different characterizations because of the lack of individual identity of the entangled particles @xcite .",
    "the use of uncertainty relations has provided an efficient approach for obtaining one of the most precise experimental measures of entanglement .",
    "@xcite a quantitative evaluation of the entangled states can be defined in terms of expectation values of a convenient witness operator .",
    "this operator , called the entanglement witness , is defined as taking positive values for separable states and negative ones for entangled states .",
    "thus , an appropriate uncertainty relation allows us to choose macroscopic properties which define an entanglement witness .",
    "a good level of interest has been focused on the special case of entanglement in macroscopic properties which has been particularly motivated by experiments that have shown the presence of entanglement in solid state systems .",

    "_ @xcite and bose and tribedi @xcite showed entanglement in antiferromagnetic spin systems .    since these experimental susceptibility measurements are applicable to systems with spins localized in sites of the lattice , they are in accordance with the entanglement witness as defined by wieniak _",

    "the present work addresses this issue .",
    "we will show that new aspects of the entanglement can appear when we consider systems with variable local spin lengths .",

    "furthermore , it is also interesting to study the limit of large clusters . in this case , using the quantum monte carlo approach @xcite we obtained the temperature dependence of the entanglement witness for linear , square and simple cubic lattices as described by the hubbard model .",
    "summarizing , we will show how the cluster length , itinerancy of the electrons and system dimensions influence the thermal entanglement on the hubbard model using direct diagonalization and quantum monte carlo methods .",

    "@xcite in summary , an arbitrary thermal state of spin @xmath0 has the follow condition @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the spin vector of the individual site @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , if the thermal state is actually a product of @xmath9 states of individual spins , the variance of magnetization would be the sum of variances of individual sites @xmath18 = s$ ] which is also valid for the general case of separable states due to the convexity of the mixture .    however , we notice that the entanglement condition ( [ entcond1 ] ) fails if the @xmath9 individual spins have different lengths @xmath19 .",
    "itinerant systems are an example of this phenomenon because the @xmath9 individual sites can have different spin lengths due to the variety of ways in which they can be filled with particles .",
    "it can also occur in localized systems , since the sites can be filled in different ways . thus , the eq .",
    "( [ thermal1 ] ) must be generalized as follows @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the largest spin length which the individual sites can take and @xmath22 is the spin spin correlation function .",
    "therefore , we can rewrite the condition for entanglement ( [ entcond1 ] ) as @xmath23    note that this is also valid for sites with same spin @xmath12 , because @xmath24 , @xmath25 and consequently the condition above is reduced to eq .",

    "the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method @xcite is an efficient approach to study large systems . using it we have studied the entanglement witness for linear , square and cubic lattices .",
    "the qmc method treats the exponentials of the grand partition function with the suzuki - trotter decomposition scheme . using a discrete hubbard - stratonovich transformation it converts the electron - electron interaction into one of free electrons interacting with a time - dependent ising field . with it",
    "we compute the relative weights of the ising field configurations .",
    "the algorithm follows the lines of those for classical systems , except for the boltzmann weight that is expressed as a sum over ising spins of a product of determinants . for the hubbard model at half filling , the product of determinants is always positive .",
    "we have used the imaginary time discretization of the qmc @xmath73 .",
    "@xcite    fig .",
    "[ mc ] shows the qmc results for a 64-site ring , and for 100-site square and cubic lattices .",
    "our @xmath54 can not be estimated accurately for large @xmath59 because the qmc becomes unstable at low temperatures and with strong coulombian interaction .",
    "@xcite    furthermore , we include in fig .",
    "[ mc ] the thermodynamic limit extrapolation obtained through the linear chain results from the direct diagonalization for small clusters . note that the extrapolation is consistent with the simulation .",
    "notice that for different lattices , the results for @xmath54 are similar revealing no new behavior .",
    "wesniak _ et al . _ @xcite have suggested that magnetic susceptibility can be a macroscopic ( thermodynamical ) spin entanglement witness without complete knowledge of the specific model ( hamiltonian ) of the solid .",
    "however , we observed here that its applicability is restricted to the insulator materials because local features of the spin length affect the deviation of the witness .",
    "we have developed a generalization that allows us to get information about system entanglement with variable local spin lengths such as found in itinerant electron systems .",
    "moreover , our witness is also valid for fixed local spin lengths and consequently , it can be used experimentally in conductor or insulator materials .    as an application , we studied thermal entanglement for the one , two and three dimensional half filled hubbard model .",
    "we obtained the critical temperature @xmath54 below which the system is certainly entangled .",
    "we have shown that there is a coulombian repulsion that presents a global @xmath54 maximum .",
    "this feature is relevant for quantum information science , since it reveals the optimal coulombian repulsion referent to the highest temperature where the system is definitely entangled .",
    "in addition , the decrease of @xmath54 for @xmath74 indicates that the itinerancy of electrons favors the entanglement .",
    "furthermore , at the asymptotic regime @xmath60 we show , through a numerical extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit , that @xmath54 is in accordance with the exact result for the @xmath72-@xmath0 heisenberg model .",
    "a recent study has shown that higher spin length increases the @xmath54 .",
    "@xcite since higher spin length means higher internal degrees of freedom the above result shows a strong favoring of entanglement according to the increases in the internal degrees of freedom . in this work , from the results of @xmath54 for linear , square and cubic lattices",
    ", we notice that an increase in the external spin degrees of freedom produces similar results .",
    "these results suggest that the dependence between entanglement and internal spin degrees of freedom is far stronger than between entanglement and external spin degrees of freedom .",
