    "the lower cut - off  for the nematic phase is found to increase with @xmath1 .",
    "for example , where for @xmath163 we found the nematic phase to exist at @xmath164 but not for @xmath165 .",
    "the computer simulation results of miguel _ et al _ @xcite show that for @xmath166 the cut - off  is slightly above @xmath167 .",
    "our results , however , show that the nematic phase exists at @xmath167",
    ". this may be due to error in the structural parameters values found from the py theory .    both versions of the  give similar results for the transition density @xmath168 but give the values of the order parameters including the change in density at the transition which are different from each other .",
    "more surprising is the way the values of the order parameters @xmath117 and @xmath118 vary with  and with @xmath1 ( see tables ii - v ) found from the two version of the theory .",
    "while the sodft predicts that @xmath117 and @xmath118 decrease as the transition  is increased , the mwda predicts them to increase .",
    "the computer simulation results @xcite do not give any clear indication as how these parameters vary with transition temperature .",
    "similar difference in the variation of the values of the order parameters with @xmath1 is also found .    in table ii",
    "- v we give the values of the transition parameters found from the two theories .",
    "we also give the results found from the computer simulations at @xmath169 for @xmath170 .",
    "there is very good agreement between these results at @xmath171 .",
    "the transition density found from the theories are identical though somewhat higher than the value found from the simulation .",
    "the value of @xmath172 found from these methods are also in good agreement , though mwda predicts the value of @xmath172 which is lower than the sodft as well as simulation value .",
    "pressure and chemical potentials are in good agreement .",
    "but there is difference in the value of @xmath117 and @xmath118 . at @xmath173",
    "both theories predict the transition density which is high compared to the md value .",
    "one of the possible reasons for this is , as pointed out in sec .",
    "ii , the inaccuracy in the values of c - harmonics at higher temperature .",
    "the py theory is known to underestimate the angular correlations and this defect of the py theory becomes more pronounced as  is increased for a given @xmath1 .",
    "this may be the reason why the theory predicts the transition at higher density than the md value . as a consequence of this the transition pressure and the chemical potential are also substantially higher than the md values .",
    "this comparison at @xmath174 show that while the dft is good to predict the freezing parameters , the py values of structural parameters at higher  are lower than the actual values .",
    "we hope to combine the py and hnc theories to generate accurate values of the harmonics of the  and with these values to compute the full phase diagram .",
