    "no - slip billiard systems have received so far very little attention despite some interesting features that distinguish them from the much more widely studied standard billiards .",
    "these non - standard types of billiards are discrete time systems in dimension @xmath2 ( after taking the natural poincar section of a flow ) representing a rotating disc with unit kinetic energy that moves freely in a billiard domain with piecewise smooth boundary .",
    "although not hamiltonian , these systems are nevertheless time reversible and leave invariant the canonical billiard measure .",
    "they also exhibit dynamical behavior that is in sharp contrast with standard billiards .",
    "for example , they very often contain period-@xmath1 orbits having small elliptic islands .",
    "these regions exist amid chaos that appears , in numerical experiments , to result from the usual mechanisms of dispersing and focusing .",
    "we are aware of only two articles on this subject prior to our @xcite : one by broomhead and gutkin @xcite showing that no - slip billiard orbits in an infinite strip are bounded , and another by wojtkowski , characterizing linear stability for a special type of period-@xmath1 orbit . in this paper",
    "we extend their results as will be detailed shortly , and develop the basic theory of no - slip billiards in a more systematic way . in this section",
    "we explain the organization of the paper and highlight our main new results .",
    "section [ preliminaries ] gives preliminary information and sets notation and terminology concerning rigid collisions .",
    "it specializes the general results from @xcite ( stated in that paper in arbitrary dimension for bodies of general shapes and mass distributions ) to discs in the plane with rotationally symmetric mass distributions .",
    "the main fact is briefly summarized in proposition [ classification ] .",
    "although the classification into specular and no - slip collisions is the same as in @xcite , our approach is more differential geometric in style and may have some conceptual advantages .",
    "for example , we derive this classification ( in @xcite ) from an orthogonal decomposition of the tangent bundle @xmath3 restricted to the boundary @xmath4 ( orthogonal relative to the kinetic energy riemannian metric in the system s configuration manifold @xmath5 ) into physically meaningful subbundles .",
    "this orthogonal decomposition is explained here only for discs in the plane .    by a planar _ no - slip billiard _ system we mean a mechanical system in @xmath6 in which one of the colliding bodies , which may have arbitrary shape , is fixed in place , whereas the second , moving body is a disc with rotationally symmetric mass distribution ; post - collision velocities ( translational and rotational ) are determined from pre - collision velocities via the no - slip collision map and between consecutive collisions the bodies undergo free motion .",
    "contrary to the standard case , the moving particle s mass distribution influences the collision properties ( via an angle parameter which is denoted @xmath7 throughout the paper ) .",
    "the main definitions and notations concerning no - slip billiard systems , in particular the notions of _ reduced phase space _ , _ velocity phase space _ , and the _ product , eigen- _ and _ wavefront _ frames , are introduced in section [ noslip billiards definitions ] .",
    "a special feature of no - slip billiards around which much of the present study is based , is the ubiquitous occurrence of period-@xmath1 trajectories .",
    "the general description of these trajectories is given in section [ periodic section ] . in section [ sec :",
    "differential ] we obtain the differential of the no - slip billiard map and show the form it takes for period-@xmath1 trajectories .    for general collision systems",
    "as considered in @xcite ( satisfying energy and momenta conservation , time reversibility , involving impulsive forces that can only act at the contact point between colliding bodies ) , the issue of characterizing smooth invariant measures still needs much further investigation , although it is shown there that the canonical ( liouville ) measure is invariant if a certain field of subspaces defined in terms of the collision maps at each collision configuration @xmath8 is parallel with respect to the kinetic energy metric .",
    "this is the case for planar no - slip billiards , so that the standard billiard measure is still invariant .",
    "( note , however , that the configuration manifold is now @xmath9-dimensional . ) a detailed proof of this fact , in addition to comments on time reversibility are given in section [ measure reversible ] .",
    "dynamics proper begins with sections [ wedge section ] and [ higher order polygon ] , which are concerned with no - slip billiard systems in wedge - shaped regions and polygons .",
    "here we generalize the main result from @xcite . in that paper",
    "it is shown that orbits of the no - slip billiard system in an infinite strip domain are bounded . by extending and refining",
    "this fact to wedge regions we obtain local stability for periodic orbits in no - slip polygonal billiards .",
    "this is theorem [ polygon stability ] .",
    "we also give in section [ higher order polygon ] an exhaustive description of periodic orbits in wedge billiards .",
    "finally , in section [ curved section ] we consider linear stability of period-@xmath1 orbits in the presence of curvature .",
    "our results here extend those of @xcite for no - slip sinai billiards .",
    "wojtkowski makes in @xcite the following striking observation : for a special period-@xmath1 orbit in a sinai billiard ( corresponding in our study to angle @xmath10 ) there is a parameter defined in terms of the curvature of the circular scatterer that sets a threshold between elliptic and hyperbolic behavior .",
    "this is based on an analysis of the differential of the billiard map at the periodic trajectory . here",
    "we derive similar results for period-@xmath1 orbits in general .",
    "although the analysis is purely linear , we observe the occurrence of elliptic islands and stable behavior in systems that are the no - slip counterpart of fully chaotic standard billiards . the fast transition between stability and chaos near",
    "the threshold set by the curvature parameter obtained from the linear analysis is also very apparent numerically .",
    "as already observed by wojtkowski in @xcite , proving local stability in the presence of curvature would require a difficult kam analysis ( for reversible , but not hamiltonian systems ; cf .",

    "these two spaces are given by @xmath67 and @xmath68 figure [ orthogonal ] shows typical vectors in these orthogonal subspaces .",
    "we can now state in the present very special case one of the main results of @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite . in the interior of @xmath5 , the motion of the system , in the absence of potential forces ,",
    "is geodesic relative to the kinetic energy metric . in dimension two",
