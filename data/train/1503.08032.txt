    "<S> we study the price dynamics of 65 stocks from the dow jones composite average from 1973 until 2014 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is possible to define a daily market volatility @xmath0 which is directly observable from data . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is usually indirectly defined by @xmath1 where the @xmath2 are the daily returns of the market index and the @xmath3 are i.i.d . </S>",
    "<S> random variables with vanishing average and unitary variance . </S>",
    "<S> the relation @xmath1 alone is unable to give an operative definition of the index volatility , which remains unobservable . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> we show that using the whole information available in the market , the index volatility can be operatively defined and detected .    </S>",
    "<S> market volatility ; absolute returns ; long - range auto - correlations ; cross - correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well know that stock market returns are uncorrelated on lags larger than a single day . </S>",
    "<S> this is an inescapable consequence of the efficiency of markets . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> absolute returns have memory for very long times , a phenomenon known as volatility clustering . </S>",
    "<S> these phenomena are very well documented in the literature and known as stylized facts @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , there is a large empirical evidence that volatility auto - correlations decay hyperbolically @xcite and there is also a growing evidence that volatility signals have a multi - fractal nature @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> daily historical volatility is an unobservable variable and is usually measured by the absolute value of daily returns which are instead observable . </S>",
    "<S> this definition gives only an approximation of the real volatility @xmath0 which can be indirectly defined by @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the daily returns of the market index and the @xmath3 are i.i.d . </S>",
    "<S> random variables with vanishing average and unitary variance . </S>",
    "<S> the relation @xmath1 alone is unable to give an operative definition of the index volatility , which remains unobservable . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that using the whole information available in the market , the index volatility can be operatively defined and detected , i.e. , we will define an observable volatility for a market index which exhibits all the statistical features expected for this variable .    </S>",
    "<S> the daily returns of single stock ( say @xmath4 ) are given by @xmath5 $ ] where @xmath6 is the closing price of stock @xmath4 at day @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> then , if one wants to extract volatility from data one can consider that @xmath8 where the @xmath3 have vanishing averages and unitary variance . </S>",
    "<S> volatility @xmath9 can be eventually extracted considering the high frequency ( intra - day ) continuous trading , but the problem remains highly unsolved because of the overnight contribution to the return @xmath10 for which there is not continuous trading . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the best measure of ( historical ) daily volatility simply remain the absolute returns @xmath11 .    if the aim is to measure the global volatility of a market , we will show that things can be different . </S>",
    "<S> one can address the problem considering volatility of a proper representative index . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , if one considers a price - weighted index ( as nikkei 225 ) the main contributions will be artificially given by those stocks with a larger price . the problem is circumvented if one considers a capitalization - weighted index ( as hang seng ) or an equally - weighted index ( as s@xmath12p 500 ewi ) . </S>",
    "<S> the daily return @xmath2 of this last index is simply the plain average of the returns of its components . i.e.    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the number of stocks in the basket and @xmath15 and @xmath6 is the daily closing price of the stock @xmath4 at day @xmath7 . for the other two types of index </S>",
    "<S> the difference is that the average is weighed by price or by capitalization .    </S>",
    "<S> again , the underlying index daily volatility @xmath0 is not directly observable from daily returns but it is indirectly defined by @xmath16 . because of market efficiency , it can be assumed that the @xmath3 are independent identically distributed random variables with vanishing average and unitary variance . </S>",
    "<S> one could argue that @xmath0 is , indeed , observable from high frequency data , but , as already mentioned , the problem of the overnight contribution to the daily returns remains .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , since daily market volatility is not objectively given by the index return ( only the product @xmath17 is observable ) , its distribution depends on the model chosen for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> gaussianity is often assumed as in arch - garch modeling ( the leptokurticity of the distribution of returns is , in this case , entirely charged to volatility ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , one can do other choices for the distribution of @xmath3 as , for example , the uniform distribution ( between @xmath18 and @xmath19 in order that the variance is unitary ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we consider @xmath20 titles of dow jones from 1973 to 2014 so that @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> dow jones as an index is not equally weighted but we can construct ourselves an ew dow jones index for which the daily returns @xmath2 are simply the plain average of returns of its components as in definition ( [ ewi - return ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the absolute returns are then given by @xmath22 which are the absolute returns of the associated equally - weighted index ( for price - weighted and capitalization - weighted indexes the only difference is that some weights must be introduced ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the core of this paper is the definition of the volatility as @xmath23 so that    @xmath24    where @xmath2 and @xmath0 are defined in equation ( [ ewi - return ] ) and equation ( [ average - volatility ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> most of the models assume that @xmath0 and @xmath25 are uncorrelated for any value of the lag @xmath26 ( negative , positive or vanishing ) or they assume ( as arch - garch ) a short range correlation ( a correlation only for small values of @xmath27 . ) </S>",
    "<S> moreover @xmath28 and @xmath29 should be uncorrelated for any non vanishing @xmath26 as well as @xmath30 and @xmath25 .    therefore , the first step is to show that all these properties holds according to our definition of volatility . after having computed the correlations @xmath31 , @xmath32 and also @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , </S>",
    "<S> we have plotted them in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . as it can be well appreciated </S>",
    "<S> the four above considered cross - correlations and the auto - correlation substantially vanish . </S>",
    "<S> this is better appreciated if compared with the volatility auto - correlation @xmath36 which is also plotted and which , on the contrary , exhibits a strong lag dependence and it is significantly positive for lags up to 250 working days .    , @xmath37 and all the cross - correlations between @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be noticed that all except the auto - correlation of @xmath38 are vanishing . ]    </S>",
    "<S> once shown that the variables @xmath3 are independent from each other , from the absolute returns ( 2 ) and from the volatilities ( 3 ) , we need to show that they have vanishing expected value ( @xmath41 ) and unitary variance ( @xmath42 ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we obtain a better result , in fact , the distribution of the @xmath3 is uniform in the range @xmath43 $ ] ( which implies vanishing expected value and unitary variance but also implies @xmath44 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result , which is our second step , can be appreciated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] where the empirical distribution or @xmath37 , as defined by ( 4 ) , is plotted .    . </S>",
    "<S> one has @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we still have a third step , to complete our argument . </S>",
    "<S> having assumed complete independence of the @xmath3 from the volatilities one forcefully has that the auto - correlation @xmath47 only differs for a positive multiplicative constant @xmath48 from the auto - correlation @xmath49 at any time lag @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the auto - correlation of the absolute returns is @xmath51 then taking into account that @xmath52 and assuming mutual independence between the @xmath0 and the @xmath3 , one has for any @xmath50 : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the volatility auto - correlation @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the constant @xmath57 where we have used the uniform distribution value @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> we compute from sample @xmath59 and @xmath60 so that @xmath61 .     and @xmath40 and their cross - correlations . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that the four correlations are ( almost ) identical once rescaled . ]    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , following the same steps , one can easily compute @xmath62 where @xmath56 is the same value ( 8) previously computed ( @xmath63 ) so that ( 6 ) and ( 9 ) are very strict requirements . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that both relations ( 6 ) and ( 9 ) hold , in fact , the four correlations , rescaled by @xmath56 ( or by @xmath64 ) , are plotted in fig . [ fig3 ] where it can be appreciated that they are almost identical for all values of the lag @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> notice , that the coefficient @xmath56 is not a fitting parameter , but it is in dependently derived by market data . the fact that after rescaling the four correlations coincide ultimately confirms that it is correct to write @xmath65 where @xmath3 and @xmath0 are the mutually independent variables we have defined .    in sum </S>",
    "<S> , we have defined the volatilities @xmath0 and , consequently , the variables @xmath3 so that they ( a ) are mutually independent , ( b ) the @xmath3 are also independent from absolute returns , ( c ) the @xmath3 are i.i.d . </S>",
    "<S> uniformly distributed with vanishing expected value and unitary variance , ( d ) the auto - correlation of the volatility exhibits a strong lag dependence and it is significantly positive for lags up to 250 working days , ( e ) the correct scaling of cross - correlations and auto - correlations involving the @xmath66 and the @xmath0 holds . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we have given a definition of daily market volatility which is observable and keep all the statistical features expected for this variable .    </S>",
    "<S> we can conclude by saying that while for a single stock it is impossible to extract the volatility from return using @xmath65 , we have found a simple way to do that for an index using all absolute returns of the single stocks entering in the index . </S>"
