    "when a suspension of highly polarizable dielectric particles is subjected to an intense electric field , the induced dipole moments cause the particles to form chains along the field direction , resulting in complex anisotropic structures .",
    "these chain structures alter the apparent viscosity of the suspension by several orders of magnitude , and are the basis of the electrorheological ( er ) effect . under the action of the er effect , the arrangement of particles , or the shape of the lattice changes and the local electric field deviates from the lorentz cavity field @xcite . as a result , these structures have anisotropic physical properties , such as in the effective conductivity and permittivity @xcite , and in the optical nonlinerity enhancement @xcite .",
    "the rapid field - induced aggregation and the large anistropy in their properties render this field - induced - structured material potentially important for technological applications @xcite .",
    "moreover , the applied electric field used in most er experiments is quite high , and important data on nonlinear er effects induced by a strong electric field have been reported recently @xcite . a convenient method of probing the nonlinear characteristics of the field - induced structures is to measure the harmonics of the nonlinear polarization under the application of a sinusoidal ( ac ) electric field .",
    "thus by measuring the ac responses both parallel and perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis of the structures , it is possible to perform a real - time monitoring of the field - induced aggregation process .",
    "recently , the effect of nonlinear characteristics on the interparticle force has been analyzed in an er suspension of nonlinear particles @xcite and further extended to a nonlinear host medium @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear characteristics are due to the field - dependence of the dielectric constants of the materials used in er fluids , which have a constitutive relation @xmath0 .",
    "when a nonlinear composite with nonlinear dielectric particles embedded in a host medium , or with a nonlinear host medium is subjected to a sinusoidal field , the electrical response in the composite will in general be a superposition of many sinusoidal functions @xcite .",
    "it is natural to investigate the effects of a nonlinear characteristics on the ac response in an er fluid which can be regarded as a nonlinear composite medium @xcite .",
    "the strength of the nonlinear polarization should be reflected in the magnitude of the harmonics .    in this work",
    ", we will develop a perturbation expansion @xcite method and a self - consistent theory @xcite to calculate the ac response of a nonlinear compsite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we calculate the dipole moment of the polarized spherical particles in an anisotropic composite and extract the harmonic response . in section iii , we perform a series expansion of the local field inside the particles from the self - consistent solution , in an attempt to obtain analytic expressions of the higher harmonics of the dipole moment .",
    "numerical results are performed in section iv to validate the analytic results .",
    "discussions on the results will be given .",
    "we first examine the effect of a nonlinear characteristics on the induced dipole moment .",
    "we concentrate on the case where the suspended particles have a nonlinear dielectric constant , while the host medium has a linear dielectric constant @xmath1 .",
    "the nonlinear characteristics gives rise to a field - dependent dielectric coefficient @xcite . in which case , the electric displacement - electric field relation inside the spheres is given by : _",
    "1=_1*e*_1+e_1 ^ 2_1 = _ 1*e*_1 , [ nl - coefficient ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the linear coefficient and the nonlinear coefficient of the suspended particles respectively .",
    "this constitutes an approximation : the local field inside the particles is assumed to be uniform and the assumption is called the decoupling approximation @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that such an approximation yields a lower bound for the accurate result for the local field @xcite .",
    "we further assumed that both @xmath4 and @xmath3 are independent of frequency , which is a valid assumption for low - frequency processes in er fluids . as a result ,",
    "the induced dipole moment under an applied field @xmath5 is given by : = _ e a^3 e(t ) , where @xmath6 is the field - dependent dipolar factor and is given by : = _ 1-_2 _ 1 + 2_2 = _ 1 + e_1 ^ 2 -_2 _",
    "1+e_1 ^ 2 + 2_2 .",
    "in order to obtain the effective dielectric constant @xmath7 , we invoke the maxwell - garnett approximation ( mga ) for anisotropic composites @xcite .",
    "for the longitudinal field case when the ac field is applied along the uniaxial anisotropic axis , the mga takes on the form = f , whereas for an transverse field case when the ac field is applied perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis , the mga reads = f , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the local field factors parallel and perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis respectively , and @xmath10 is the volume fraction of particles .",
    "these factors are defined as the ratio of the local field in the particles to the lorentz cavity field @xcite . for isotropic composites , @xmath11 , while both @xmath12 and @xmath13 will deviate from unity for an anisotropic distribution of particles in composites .",
    "the @xmath14 factors have been evaluated in a tetragonal lattice of dipole moments @xcite and similar quantities were calculated in various field - induced - structured composites @xcite ; they satisfy the sum rule : @xmath15 in what follows , we denote @xmath8 as @xmath14 for notation convenience .    on the other hand , the effective nonlinear dielectric constant can be given by @xcite _",
    "e=_v(*r*)|*e*(*r*,t)|^2 dv = e_1 ^ 2 + e_2 ^ 2 , where @xmath16 the volume of the composite and @xmath10 is the volume fraction .",
    "accordingly , the local electric field inside the spheres can be expressed in terms of the derivative of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath17 : e_1 ^ 2=e^2(t ) .",
    "if we apply a sinusoidal electric field , i.e. @xmath18 , the induced dipole moment @xmath19 will depend on time sinusoidally , too . by virtue of the inversion symmetry",
    ", @xmath19 is a superposition of odd - order harmonics such that = p_t+p_33t+ .",
    "also , the local electric field contains similar harmonics = e_t+e_3 3t+ .",
    "these harmonic coefficients can be extracted from the time dependence of the solution of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "in what follows , we will apply two methods to extract the harmonics of the induced dipole moment and the eletric field : the perturbation expansion method ( pem ) @xcite and the self - consistent ( sc ) theory @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent theory can deal with the case of strong nonlinearity , while the perturbation expansion method is applicable to weak nonlinearity only , i.e. @xmath21 , limited by the convergence of the series expansion . in the case of weakly nonlinear response , the sc theory should agree with pem .",
    "we expand @xmath19 and @xmath22 into a taylor expansion @xmath23where",
    "@xmath24    for weak nonlinearity , we can rewrite eqs.(10 ) and ( 11 ) , keeping the lowest orders of @xmath25 and @xmath26 : @xmath27 in the case of a sinusoidal field , we can expand @xmath28 in terms of the first and the third harmonics .",
    "the comparison with eq.(8 ) yields the harmonics of the induced dipole moment : @xmath29    similarly , we find the harmonics of the local electric field @xmath30 where @xmath31    in the above analysis , we have used the identity @xmath32 to obtain the first and the third harmonics .",
    "similar analysis can be used to extract the higher - order harmonics , by retaining more terms in the series expansion .",
    "eq.(7 ) is actually a self - consistent equation since its right - hand side depends on the local field itself .",
    "it must be solved self - consistently , and the local electric field reads : = where @xmath33    for a sinusoidal applied electric field , we determine numerically the harmonics of the induced dipole moment and the local electric field , which is a subject for the next section .",
    "in this section , we perform numerical calculations to investigate the effects of a nonlinear characteristics on the harmonics of the induced dipole moment and the local electric field .",
    "as shown in section iii , the harmonics of the induced dipole moment and the local electric field are both related to the field - induced anisotropy parameter @xmath14 . in order to investigate the effect of field - induced anisotropy on the harmonics , we perform the numerical calculations . without loss of generality ,",
    "we let @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for model calculations . we let",
    "@xmath38 to normalize the induced dipole moment .    in fig.1",
    ", we plot the normalized harmonics versus @xmath14 by using the sc theory for the longitudinal electric field .",
    "it is evident that , for increasing @xmath14 , the harmonics of the induced dipole moment and the local electric field are both increased .",
    "similarly , in fig.2 the same quantities are plotted but for the transverse electric field .",
    "we find that the harmonics are decreased as @xmath14 increases .",
    "both fig.1 and fig.2 also show that the harmonics are strongly dependent on the nonlinear response of the suspended particles .",
    "moreover , increasing the nonlinear response leads to an increase in the harmonics .",
    "this is consistent with the results of our recent work @xcite , in which a pair of nonlinear particles suspended in a linear host was considered .    in figs.3 and 4",
    ", we compare the sc theory and pem . for weak nonlinearity , @xmath39 ,",
    "the pem results coincide with the sc results , while for moderate nonlinearity @xmath40 , there are some deviations . in both cases , we find that the pem results are in good agreement with the sc results for weak nonlinearity . for strong nonlinearity , there are large deviations ( not shown here ) and the sc theory must be used .",
    "the @xmath14 dependence of the local field can qualitatively be understood with the spectral representation @xcite . from eq.(7 ) , denoting @xmath41 , we find that @xmath42 , where @xmath43 .",
    "using the numerical values of our model calculations , we find @xmath44 , and @xmath45 . when @xmath14 increases , @xmath46 decreases , leading to an increase in the local electric field @xmath47 .",
    "here a few comments on our results are in order . in the present study",
    ", we have examined the case of nonlinear particles suspending in a linear host .",
    "we may extend our considerations to a nonlinear host medium @xcite . in this case ,",
    "preliminary results show that qualitatively similar yet more complex behaviors in the ac response have been observed .",
    "so far , we have not considered the frequency dependence of the particle dielectric constant . in a realistic situation ,",
    "the dielectric constant of the particles can decrease with the increase of the frequency . for simplicity",
    ", we may adopt the debye relaxation expression for @xmath2 .",
    "preliminary results show that the ratio of the third to first harmonic decreases with frequency , results that are in accord with recent experimental data of ref.@xcite .    to our knowledge ,",
    "an accurate evaluation of the local field factor @xmath14 during field - induced aggregation is lacking .",
    "we suggest that the ewald method @xcite can be extended to compute the @xmath14 factor in computer simulation of er fluids .",
    "this is a formidable task for the future .",
    "our present theory may be applied to the electrorheology of milk chocolate @xcite . by measuring the nonlinear ac response",
    ", it may be possible to monitor the food production processes .    in conclusion ,",
    "a self - consistent formalism has been employed to compute the induced dipole moment for suspensions in which the suspended particles have a nonlinear characteristics , in an attempt to investigate the anisotropy in the ac response .",
