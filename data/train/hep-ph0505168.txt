    "the retardation effect between two interacting particles is a relativistic phenomenon , due to the finiteness of the interaction speed .",
    "the light mesons are typical systems in which the retardation mechanisms can significantly contribute to the dynamics , since the light quark can move at a speed close to the speed of light . to take into account this effect into effective models , one has to work with a fully covariant theory .",
    "the most elegant approach , from a theoretical point of view , is the formalism with constraints @xcite , but it quickly leads to complex equations , uneasy to deal with if one wants to get analytical or numerical results .",
    "another covariant approach of mesons is the covariant oscillator quark model ( coqm ) , which allows to find an analytical expression for the wave function and numerical results in good agreement with the data @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this model uses a quadratic potential , this form being different from the linear potential , commonly assumed to describe the confining part of the interaction and suggested by lattice calculations .",
    "moreover , vanishing quark masses are not allowed in this approach .",
    "apart from these two approaches , most of the effective models found in the literature are based on the equal time ansatz , which simply takes the time coordinates of both particles to be equal , neglecting the retardation effects .",
    "this procedure allows to deal with simpler equations , and relativistic corrections can be obtained by developing an expansion in @xmath0 of the model considered , like the bethe - salpeter equation or even the qcd lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the model we propose here is an attempt to include retardation effects into the rotating string model ( rsm ) @xcite without making such an expansion , in order to estimate the retardation contribution for light quarks .",
    "the rsm is an effective model derived from the qcd lagrangian , describing a meson by two spinless quarks linked by a straight string .",
    "it has been shown that the rsm was classically equivalent to the relativistic flux tube model @xcite .",
    "this last model , firstly presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , yields meson spectra in good agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "our method , inspired from the coqm , relies on the hypothesis that the relative time between the quark and the antiquark must have a non zero value . in our framework , the evolution parameter of the system is not the common proper time of the quarks and the string , but the time coordinate of the center of mass which plays the role of an  average \" time .",

    "we find different approximations for this contribution in sec .",

    "the appendix contains some useful formulas .",
    "it has been shown that , starting from the qcd lagrangian and neglecting the spin contribution of the quark and the antiquark , the lagrange function of a meson can be built from a nambu - goto action @xcite which reads ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) @xmath3 the two first terms are the kinetic energy operators of the quark and the antiquark , whose current masses are @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "derivatives are denoted @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in this picture , @xmath11 is a common proper time for the string and the quarks . introducing auxiliary fields to get rid of the square root in the lagrangian  ( [ nambu ] ) and making the straight line ansatz to describe the string ,",

    "@xmath24 is the relative coordinate @xmath25 .",

    "this leads to the following value for the parameter @xmath21 @xmath34 equation  ( [ zeta ] ) reduces to @xmath35 in the symmetrical case ( @xmath36 ) and to @xmath37 in the nonrelativistic limit , as expected @xcite .    to go a step further ,",
    "one usually takes the temporal coordinates of the quarks and the string to be equal to the common proper time @xmath11 , this time being also the time @xmath38 in the center of mass frame @xmath39 then , we have @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "this procedure allows to deal with simpler equations , but neglects the relativistic retardation effects due to a possible non zero value of the relative time @xmath44 .",
    "since these effects are precisely those we want to study in this paper , we have to make a less restrictive hypothesis . as in the formalism of the coqm @xcite",

    "up to now , we were working in a classical framework .",
    "but in order to study the influence of the retardation on the meson spectrum , we have to consider a quantized version of the total rsm hamiltonian @xmath78 .",

    "( [ dmetc ] ) is that the retardation effects bring a negative contribution to the meson masses , and that the more probable value for the relative time is @xmath49 .",
    "it is worth noting that these results are formally identical to those of the coqm . in sec .",
    "[ compar ] , we compare the two approaches with more details .      in the rsm ,",
    "the string contribution takes into account the interactions at large distances , which are responsible for the confinement . to make more realistic models ,",

    "this formula must be modified if we consider the retardation effects .",

    "the key ingredient to compute the retardation term ( [ dm ] ) is the knowledge of @xmath107 and @xmath121 , respectively given by formulas  ( [ rho2 ] ) and ( [ acdef3 ] ) .",
    "as these expressions are complicated , we will try to get various simpler ones following the value of the quark mass @xmath122 . in the following",
    "we will use two limiting cases for @xmath123 and @xmath124 quantities : @xmath125 corresponds to a vanishing angular momentum or to a very high mass , and @xmath126 correspond to a very high angular momentum or to a very small mass .",

    "in this paper , the retardation effects in mesons are taken into account by the introduction of a non zero relative time in the rotating string hamiltonian @xcite , following a procedure inspired by the covariant oscillator quark model @xcite .",
    "treated as a perturbation , the part of the total hamiltonian containing the retardation terms is a harmonic oscillator in the relative time variable , with an effective reduced mass and an effective restoring force both depending on eigenstates of the hamiltonian independent of the relative time .",
    "the fundamental state of this oscillator gives the contribution of the retardation to the masses as well as the relative time part of the wave function .",
    "the introduction of the retardation also affects the coulomb part of the interaction , which is replaced by an effective damped potential .",
    "systems containing two particles with the same mass are only considered , but our approach leads to several interesting results .    in the light quark sector , the contribution of the retardation is not negligible ( around 200  mev for massless quarks ) but it is small enough to justify a perturbative treatment . within this approach ,",
    "the coulomb interaction is strongly reduced but the meson masses are lowered by the contribution of the retardation .",
    "the linearity of the regge trajectories is preserved , which is the most important feature of our model . at last",
    ", the relative time wave function is a gaussian function centered around zero , which confirms the validity of the equal time ansatz in first approximation .    when the quark mass increases , the contribution of the retardation to the meson masses decreases slowly .",
    "the relative time wave function becomes more and more peaked around zero , as expected .",
    "unfortunately , our model does not lead to a nonrelativistic limit in agreement with previous works .",
    "this is probably due to the treatment of the relative time which is not compatible with a proper elimination of this unphysical degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , when the effective coulomb potential and the quark self - energy @xcite are included in our rotating string model with the retardation effects , meson spectra can be computed in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "this work must be considered as a trial to compute easily the retardation effects in mesons .",
    "the simplified and approximate approach used here has no firm theoretical basis , but it shows that the contribution of these mechanisms to the masses could be non negligible .",
