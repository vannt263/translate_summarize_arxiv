    "the hickson compact groups ( hcg ; hickson 1982 ) are among the densest concentrations of galaxies in the local universe . these high densities combined with relatively low velocity dispersions , @xmath1  km  s@xmath2 ( hickson et al . 1992 ) , make them active sites of strong galaxy interactions .",
    "interactions are believed to initiate bursts of star cluster formation on many scales from dwarf galaxies along tidal tails to massive star clusters , the progenitors of today s globular clusters .",
    "one group in particular , stephan s quintet ( sq ; also known as hcg  92 ) , is notable for evidence of multiple interactions .",
    "sq is comprised of five galaxies : ngc  7317 , ngc  7318a and b , ngc  7319 and ngc  7320 ( see fig .  1 for galaxy identifications ) . based on multiwavelength observations of the group , ngc  7317 and ngc  7320",
    "show no evidence for recent interactions , unlike the other three galaxies ( ngc  7320 is a foreground galaxy ) .",
    "in particular , ngc  7318b shows morphological disruption of spiral structure , and a long tidal tail extends from ngc  7319 .",
    "the interactions have resulted in recent and ongoing star formation as evident from @xmath3 ( schombert et al .",
    "1990 ) , h@xmath4 ( vlchez & iglesias - pramo 1998 ) and far - infrared ( xu , sulentic & tuffs 1999 ) imaging . furthermore , in the photometric dwarf galaxy study of hunsberger , charlton , & zaritsky ( 1996 ) , sq was identified as hosting the richest known system of tidal dwarf galaxy candidates . from these studies",
    ", only the largest star - forming regions were resolved ; many of the young stars appeared to be distributed in the diffuse light in the tidal features between the galaxies .",
    "high spatial resolution is required to identify star cluster candidates ( scc ) which at the distance of sq ( @xmath5 ; @xmath6  mpc ) are faint point sources on the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) . _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "( ) imaging was the obvious next step for investigating the full range in scale of massive star formation structure .",
    "furthermore , with these images we could investigate whether star clusters form in diverse environments from the inner regions of galaxies to tidal debris tens of kiloparsecs from a galaxy center .",
    "sq was observed with the  wfpc2 in two pointings . the first on 30 dec 1998 , encompassed ngc  7318a / b and ngc  7319 . the second , on 17 jun 1999 , covered the extended tidal tail of ngc  7319 . on both occasions ,",
    "the images were once dithered and taken through three wide - band filters : f450w ( @xmath7 ) , f569w ( @xmath8 ) and f814w ( @xmath9 ) . the exposure times in each field",
    "were @xmath10  s , @xmath11  s and @xmath12  s for @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the data were first processed through the standard  pipeline .",
    "subsequently , they were cleaned of cosmic rays using the stsdas task gcombine , followed by the iraf task cosmicrays to remove hot pixels .",
    "1 shows the @xmath8 band image of both fields combined with the regions of interest labeled .",
    "the initial detection of point sources was undertaken using the daofind routine in daophot ( stetson 1987 ) with a very low detection threshold .",
    "this produced thousands of sources per chip , and we then performed aperture photometry on all sources .",
    "those sources with @xmath13 that appeared in the images at both dither positions were retained .",
    "sources with @xmath14 or @xmath15 were rejected as extended ( miller et al .",
    "those point sources with @xmath16 are likely foreground stars , and the remaining sources are considered star cluster candidates ( scc ) .",
    "this sample will clearly contain some foreground stars and background galaxies , but the spatial coincidence of most of the sources with the galaxy bulges and tidal features is evidence that many candidates are legitimate scc .",
    "approximately 150 sources were found in all three filters ; they are plotted in the @xmath3 versus @xmath17 color - color plot in fig .  2 .",
    "in fig .  3 , zoom images of the tidal tail in ngc  7319 and the northern starburst region ( nsr ) have the scc marked with circles . for a discussion of the extended sources in the field , see hunsberger et al .",
    "( this proceedings ) .",
    "the diversity of tidal features in sq is indicative of the complex interaction history in the group . in the dynamical history proposed by moles , sulentic , & mrquez ( 1997 ; hereafter msm97 ) , ngc  7320c ( out of the frame of fig",
    ".  1 to the northeast ) passed through the group a few hundred million years ago stripping ngc  7319 of much of its hi ( shostak et al .",
    "1984 ) and inducing the extension of the tidal tail .",
    "in addition , gas was deposited in the area that is currently the nsr .",
    "this first event would have induced star formation in the environs of ngc  7319 and perhaps triggered the observed seyfert  2 activity in the nucleus .",
    "two of the four galaxies in fig .  1",
    ", ngc  7319 and ngc  7318a , have radial velocities within 50  km  s@xmath2 of 6600  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "a third , ngc  7318b , while apparently interacting with ngc  7318a , has a discordant velocity , @xmath18  km  s@xmath2 ( hickson et al . 1992 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is inconsistent with the interpretation of ngc  7318b as a foreground galaxy because of the obvious morphological distortion seen in fig .",
    "1 . instead , in the most recent and ongoing interaction event ngc  7318b is falling into the group for the first time .",
    "hi maps of the group show that ngc  7318b still retains the bulk of its gas ( shostak et al .",
    "1984 ; msm97 ) unlike all of the galaxies with concordant velocities . as ngc",
    "7318b approaches sq , its ism is shocking the gas of the intragroup medium ( igm ) in the nsr and along its eastern spiral arm .",
    "an extended arc of both radio continuum ( van der hulst & rots 1981 ) and x - ray ( pietsch et al . 1997 ) emission supports the shocked gas scenario , and h@xmath4 emission in the same region at the radial velocity of ngc  7318b indicates that the collision - compressed gas is being converted into stars ( msm97 ) .",
    "hunsberger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) also found tidal dwarf galaxy candidates along part of the same structure .      in all regions with tidal features or galaxies",
    ", we identified scc . from the simulations of ashman & zepf ( 1992 ) of merger remnants",
    ", we expected to find massive young star clusters in the bulges of ngc  7318a and b , but there we only detected point sources with colors consistent with old globular clusters .",
    "this result can be understood if the interaction between ngc  7318a and b is relatively recent , and star formation is just beginning in the outer regions of the galaxies .",
    "this picture is consistent with the observations of ngc  7252 ( miller et al .",
    "1997 ) and the antennae ( whitmore et al . 1999 ) which suggest that cluster formation is initiated at large galactic radii and propagates inward over time . in ngc  7319",
    ", we do find young scc in the disk and bulge , supporting the older interaction scenario for the event which stripped it of its gas and pulled out the tidal tail .    from our images",
    ", it is also clear that star clusters can form _ outside _ of galaxies . in the nsr ,",
    "the star formation is occurring @xmath19  kpc from the bulge of the nearest galaxy .",
    "in addition , we discovered several young star clusters in the tidal tail of ngc  7319 . in the color - color plot ( fig .",
    "2 ) , there is a clear distinction between the sources associated with ngc  7318b and those in ngc  7319 and its tidal tail .",
    "the most recent star formation is occurring in the nsr and the spiral arms of ngc  7318b ; ages of some scc in those regions are at least as young as 5  myr .",
    "any intrinsic dust extinction would only cause an overestimate of the ages as the reddening vector is approximately parallel to the evolutionary tracks at that point .",
    "in addition to the youngest scc in each region , we also observe a spread of ages from old globular cluster candidates ( gcc ) with ages @xmath20  yr to more intermediate - aged scc , @xmath21  yr . this spread is most apparent in the nsr and along the tidal tail , both regions where extended periods of interaction - induced star formation are reasonable .",
    "furthermore , the presence of the old gcc in the tidal features suggests they were pulled out of their birth galaxies as a result of the interactions .      _",
    "j. gallagher : _ what is the spatial distribution of the cluster colors as compared to colors of the more diffuse debris ?",
    "this might help in investigating differences between cluster formation versus cluster evolution .    _",
    "s. g. : _ in general , the diffuse emission between the galaxies has @xmath3 colors similar to those of the outer regions of spiral disks .",
    "more specifically , in the nsr and along the eastern spiral arm of ngc  7318b , the diffuse light has @xmath3 colors between 0.3 and 0.5 ( schombert et al .",
    "1990 ) , as do some regions in the tidal tail .",
    "we find young cluster candidates in those regions with similar colors as well as some with @xmath23 .      _",
    "s. g. : _ there does appear to be a group of point sources clumped below the evolutionary tracks on the red end of the @xmath17 axis .",
    "i have investigated each of them , and they do not appear to be part of a distinct population .",
    "a few of these sources are quite faint in @xmath7 which could cause some scatter , and there is certainly some contamination from background galaxies and stars .      _",
    "s. g. : _ the hi distribution is unusual as most of the gas in the group is _ outside _ of the galaxies .",
    "there is as much hi as is typically found in an entire spiral galaxy to the south of ngc  7319 , including the tidal tail , and a fair amount in the nsb as well ( shostak et al .",
    "we find young scc in both of those regions .",
    "the disk of ngc  7319 is almost entirely lacking in gas , but we find some young scc candidates in that galaxy , though they are strung along the spiral arms .",
    "the bulge of ngc  7318b still has its hi , and does not appear to contain any young scc .    _",
    "g. meurer : _ are any of the centers of the galaxies blue ?",
    "i suspect the reason that you do nt see any nuclear clusters is because the galaxies are too far away hence crowding makes them difficult to distinguish .    _",
    "s. g. : _ ngc  7318a and b have similar central colors : @xmath24 and @xmath25 that are not particularly blue ( though there may be a significant amount of intrinsic reddening ) .",
    "ngc  7319 is bluer with @xmath26 and @xmath25 ; those colors are consistent with the seyfert  2 activity in the nucleus .",
    "the complex structure in the center of each of these galaxies would certainly make detecting a nuclear cluster very difficult .",
    "however , we find no young scc within the inner 23  kpc even where the light distribution is smooth . in ngc  7319",
    "we do find young scc within the bulge of the galaxy .",
    "from  wfpc2 images , we find @xmath22 scc in the environs of sq .",
    "scc are found both within the bulges of each of the galaxies ngc  7318a / b and ngc  7319 , and also in tidal features .",
    "the ages deduced from @xmath3 versus @xmath17 colors of scc are consistent with the complex interaction scenario outlined by msm97 .",
    "since only old gcc are found in the centers of ngc  7318a / b , this suggests that recent star formation has not yet occurred there .",
    "very young scc are found along the interaction shock front between the ism of ngc  7318b and the igm of sq supporting the hypothesis that this is a recent event .",
    "the spread of ages in scc found throughout the field is indicative of recurring episodes of interaction - induced star formation .",
