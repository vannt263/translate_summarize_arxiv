    "a new frontier of quantum information is the search for algorithms capable of addressing problems in low dimensional geometry and topology .",
    "the jones polynomial @xcite characterizes the topology of knots and links ( collections of circles in 3-space ) and is associated with the expectation value of a wilson loop operator in quantum chern - simons field theory in three dimensions .",
    "the algebraic content of this theory is encoded into a quantum group structure .",
    "the jones polynomial is the link invariant obtained with all the component knots labeled with the fundamental irrep of the quantum deformation of @xmath1 , denoted in the following by @xmath2 .",
    "efficient quantum algorithms for approximating the jones polynomial have been recently proposed in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we introduced the @xmath0-deformed spin network automaton model .",
    "the spin  network quantum simulator model , which essentially encodes the ( quantum deformed ) @xmath1 racah  wigner tensor algebra , was shown @xcite to be capable of implementing families of finite  states and discrete  time quantum automata which accept the language generated by the braid group , and whose transition amplitudes are indeed colored jones polynomials .",
    "the latter are an extension of the jones polynomial with arbitrary irreps of @xmath2 labeling the component knots . in this paper",
    "we shall explicitly construct a quantum circuit which efficiently simulates the dynamics of these automata and hence , if appropriately sampled with a set of measurements , approximates the colored jones polynomial .",
    "we shall discuss the complexity of the circuit showing that , since the time complexity of the spin network automaton is polynomial in the size of the input ( depending on the index of the braid group and on the number of crossings of the knot diagram ) , the algorithm that efficiently simulates the automata also provides an efficient estimation of the link invariant .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the physical setting of quantum geometry and the role that in it play the topological invariants . in section 3",
    "we concisely describe the structure of the spin network quantum automaton . in section 4",

    "general relativity ",
    "the prototype of physical theories whose dynamical variable , the gravitational field , is geometric in nature  still represents a major improvement in the ` geometrization programme ' stated by klein and einstein almost one century ago .",
    "these ideas laid dormant long after the birth of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory . in particular , the quest for a quantum gravity theory dates back to the sixties , when arnowitt , deser and misner @xcite introduced the so  called @xmath3 decomposition of einstein field equations , a hamiltonian reformulation of general relativity to be assumed as the basic ingredient for constructing a canonical quantization scheme for gravity .",
    "we refer the reader to the classical textbooks @xcite for accounts on quantum general relativistic theories up to the seventies .    nowadays",
    "such approach has been almost abandoned in favor of ( hopefully ) more effective quantization schemes , but a number of substantial contributions developed in that golden age keep circulating . a good example is provided by wheeler s ` geometrodynamics ' , which embodies the concept of ` quantum geometry ' of the physical three  dimensional space , to be thought of as quantum fluctuations of ( diffeomorphism classes of ) @xmath4metrics within the ` superspace ' @xcite . as we shall see below , @xmath4dimensional extended objects  more precisely , smooth @xmath4manifolds endowed with riemannian or lorentzian metric tensors  with their rich geometric structure play a prominent role in chern  simons quantum field theories and associated statistical field theories .",
    "moreover , models of quantum gravity in three spacetime dimensions represent by themselves very useful toy models in view of generalizations to the physically significant @xmath5dimensional case .",
    "euclidean quantum field theory is the quantization procedure of a classical field theory based on ` functional integration ' , over the space of quantum fluctuations of the physical fields @xmath6 , of @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 is the classical action defined in the wick  rotated counterpart of minkowskii spacetime @xcite .",
    "this approach to quantization can be related to classical statistical field theory , and consequently it inherits the language and methods proper of statistical mechanics ( partition functions , phase transitions , etc . ) .",
    "this latter feature is particularly fruitful if some kind of discretization prescription is applied to the classical theory and suitably extended to the path integrals which turn out to be interpretable as statistical sums or partition functionals .",
    "indeed , the most successful quantization scheme for general relativity , the ` sum over histories ' , was proposed by hawking and hartle @xcite borrowing techniques from the euclidean path integral approach mentioned above .",
    "its discretized version , simplicial quantum gravity , relies on regge s discrete reformulation of classical general relativity @xcite and has been widely addressed in the last two decades ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the geometrization programme referred to at the beginning of this section was in some sense rephrased as a ` gauge principle ' by yang and mills in @xcite .",
    "non  abelian gauge theories interacting with matter fields and their quantized counterparts still play a central role in the physics of fundamental interactions , while pure yang  mills theories ( classical and quantum ) were recognized to encode a number of interesting geometric features ( see _ e.g. _ the reviews @xcite ) .    within the class of quantum yang ",
    "mills theories we focus our attention on ` topological ' quantum field theories ( tqft ) , formulated in terms of axioms by atiyah in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . such theories ",
    "quantized through the path integral prescription starting from a classical yang ",
    "mills action defined on an orientable riemannian @xmath9dimensional space(time )  are characterized by gauge invariant partition functions and observables ( correlation functions ) depending only on the global structure of the space on which the theories live .",
    "the latter geometric functionals are computable by standard techniques in quantum field theory and provide novel representations of ` topological invariants ' for @xmath9manifolds ( and/or for particular submanifols embedded in the ambient space ) which are of prime interest both in mathematics and in theoretical physics .",
    "all of this enlightens a new kind of connection between geometry and quantum physics : in tqft the physical degrees of freedom of spacetime geometry are global and not local .",
    "four dimensional einstein gravity quantized through the euclidean path integral is not a tqft , however the role of quantum @xmath4geometry is once more enhanced since gravity in three spacetime dimensions can be reformulated as a gauge theory closely related to the @xmath1 chern  simons tqft @xcite .    without entering into technical details on tqft in general ,",
    "let us just recall some of the basic ingredients of chern  simons quantum field theory .",
    "the classical @xmath1 chern  simons action for the @xmath4sphere @xmath10 ( the simplest compact , oriented @xmath4manifold without boundary ) is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the connection 1form with value in the lie algebra @xmath13 of the gauge group , @xmath14 is the coupling constant , @xmath15 is the exterior differential , @xmath16 is the wedge product of differential forms and the trace is taken over lie algebra indices .",
    "the partition function of the quantum theory is obtained from the ` path integral ' prescription , by integrating the exponential of @xmath17 times the classical action ( [ csaction ] ) over the space of gauge  invariant flat @xmath1 connections ( the field variables ) according to the formal expression @xmath18\\;=\\ ; \\int [ da]\\,\\exp \\left\\{\\frac{i\\ , k}{4 \\pi}\\ , s_{cs}\\,(a)\\,\\right\\},\\ ] ] where the coupling constant @xmath14 is constrained to be a positive integer by the gauge  invariant quantization procedure .",
    "the generating functional ( [ csfunct ] ) , written for a generic compact oriented @xmath4manifold @xmath19 with @xmath20 , is a global invariant , namely it depends only on the topological type of @xmath19 .",
    "this is basically due to the feature that the space of solutions of quantum cs theory is finite dimensional @xcite .    the gauge  invariant observables in the quantum cs theory are expectation values of wilson line operators associated with oriented knots ( or links ) embedded in the @xmath4manifold ( commonly referred to as wilson ` loop ' operators ) .",
    "knots and links are ` colored ' with irreducible representations ( irreps ) of the gauge group @xmath1 , restricted to values ranging over the set @xmath21 .",
    "integer @xmath14 will be related to the deformation parameter @xmath0 in @xmath22 , the deformed universal enveloping algebra of @xmath1 , with @xmath23 .",
    "in particular , the wilson loop operator associated with a knot @xmath24 carrying a spin@xmath25 irreducible representation is defined , for a fixed root of unity @xmath0 , as ( the trace of ) the holonomy of the connection 1form @xmath12 evaluated along the closed loop @xmath24 @xmath26 , namely @xmath27=\\tr_j\\,p\\exp\\oint_ka\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 denotes path ordering .",
    "for a link @xmath29 made of a collection of knots @xmath30 , each labeled by an irrep , the expression of the composite wilson operator reads @xmath31\\,=\\,\\prod_{l=1}^s\\;\\mathbf{w}_{j_l}\\,[k_l;q]\\;.\\ ] ] in the framework of the path integral quantization procedure , expectation values of observables are defined as functional averages weighted with the exponential of the classical action . in particular , the functional average of the wilson operator ( [ will ] ) is @xmath32\\,=\\,\\frac { \\int [ da]\\;\\mathbf{w}_{j_1 \\ldots j_s}\\,[l]\\,\\exp^{\\,\\frac{ik } { 4\\pi } \\,s_{cs}\\,(a ) } } { \\int [ da]\\;\\exp^{\\,\\frac{ik } { 4\\pi } s_{cs}\\,(a)}},\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the cs action for the @xmath4sphere given in ( [ csaction ] ) and the generating functional in the denominator is usually normalized to 1 .",
    "it can be shown that this expectation value , which essentially$ ] and the genuine colored jones polynomial is @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 $ ] , once suitable normalizations for the unknots have been chosen . here",
    "@xmath37 is the writhe associated with the planar diagram @xmath38 of the oriented link @xmath29 , defined as @xmath39 .",
    "the summation runs over the self crossing points of @xmath38 and @xmath40 according to simple combinatorial rules .",
    "the writhe is easily evaluated from the link diagram by simple counting arguments . ]",
    "coincides with the colored jones polynomial @xcite , depends only on the isotopy type of the oriented link @xmath29 and on the set of irreps @xmath41 .",
    "the original jones polynomial @xcite is recovered when a spin@xmath42 representation is placed on each link component .",
    "however the colored link invariants are more effective than jones in detecting knots , as discussed in @xcite",
    ".    the colored invariants ( [ wilexpect ] ) are the basic objects that will be addressed for computational purposes in the rest of this paper .",
    "the reader interested in an account of their construction through the quantum group approach may refer to @xcite ( sect .",
    "3 ) , where the issue of ( unitary ) braid group representations is also considered . in the following section we shall use yet another kind of approach @xcite , which relies on the introduction of the boundary wess  zumino ",
    "witten conformal field theory into the chern  simons setting .",
    "such approach provides a particularly useful presentation of the colored jones polynomials as expectation values of unitary braiding operators in wzw theory .",
    "we leave for the concluding remarks at the end of the paper the discussion of possible extensions of the quantum algorithm discussed in next session to the other hard problems arising in the theory of closed ( hyperbolic ) 3-manifolds .",
    "in the first subsection of this section we shall briefly review automata theory and define basic concepts of formal language theory .",
    "then we describe the model of quantum automaton relevant in the present context : the _ spin network quantum automaton _ , which provides a natural connection between quantum computation and link invariants @xcite .      the theory of automata and formal languages addresses in a rigorous way the notions of computing machines and computational processes .",
    "we review first some of the basic concepts .    if @xmath43 is an alphabet , made of letters , digits or other symbols , and @xmath44 denotes the set of all finite sequences of words over @xmath43 , a language @xmath45 over @xmath43 is a subset of @xmath44 .",
    "the length of the word @xmath46 is denoted by @xmath47 and @xmath48 is its @xmath17th symbol .",
    "the concatenation of two words @xmath49 is denoted simply by @xmath50 . in the fifties",
    "noam chomsky @xcite introduced a four  level hierarchy describing formal languages according to their structure ( grammar and syntax ) : regular languages , context  free languages , context  sensitive languages and recursively enumerable languages .",
    "the processing of each language is inherently related to a particular computing model ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for an account on formal languages ) .",
    "here we are interested in finite - state automata , the machines able to accept regular languages .",
    "a deterministic finite state automaton consists of a finite set of states @xmath51 , an input alphabet @xmath43 , a transition function @xmath52 , an initial state @xmath53 and a set of accepting states @xmath54 .",
    "the automaton starts in @xmath53 and reads an input word @xmath46 from left to right . at the @xmath17th step ,",
    "if the automaton reads the symbol @xmath48 , then it updates its state to @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the state of the automaton reading @xmath48 .",
    "one says that the word has been accepted if the final state reached after reading @xmath46 is in @xmath57 .    in the case of a non - deterministic finite - state automaton ,",
    "the transition function is defined as a map @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the power set of @xmath60 .",
    "after reading a particular symbol , the transition can lead to different states , according to some assigned probability distribution .    generally speaking",
    ", quantum finite - state automata are obtained from their classical probabilistic counterparts by moving from the notion of ( classical ) probability , associated with transitions , to quantum probability amplitudes .",
    "computation takes place inside the computational hilbert space through unitary matrices . in the present context",
    "we shall confine our attention to the so - called measure - once quantum automaton @xcite .",
    "the latter is a 5-tuple @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a finite set of quantum states , @xmath63 is a finite input alphabet with an end  marker symbol @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the set of transition functions induced by reading @xmath63 .",
    "the probability amplitude for the transition from the state @xmath66 to the state @xmath67 upon reading the symbol @xmath68 is therefore @xmath69 .",
    "the state @xmath70 is the initial configuration of the system , and @xmath71 is an accepting final state .",
    "for all states and symbols the function @xmath72 must be represented by unitary operators .",
    "marker @xmath64 is the last symbol of each input word and computation terminates after reading it . at the end of the computation",
    "the configuration of the automaton is measured , if it is in an accepting state then the input is accepted , otherwise it is rejected .",
    "the probability amplitude for the automaton of accepting the string @xmath46 is given by @xmath73 for @xmath74 ( @xmath75 denotes ordered product , and for @xmath46 we used the product symbol to denote concatenations ) .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath76 defines the language @xmath77 accepted by that particular automaton . if @xmath78 denotes the projector over the accepting states , the probability for the automaton of accepting the string @xmath46 is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 .      in this subsection",
    "we review briefly the structure of the _ q - deformed spin network _ automaton model , first discussed in @xcite .",
    "this quantum automaton is an extension of the spin network model of computation , introduced in @xcite and worked out in @xcite , constructed on the combinatorics of the racah ",
    "wigner algebra of the quantum group @xmath2 .",
    "the _ q - deformed spin network _ is a model for a quantum automaton capable of processing the braid group language . from now on we shall refer to the model simply as _ spin network _ , subsuming the use of the deformed algebra .",
    "the spin  network can be seen as a collection of graphs @xmath81 parametrized by an integer @xmath82 that is a measure of the size of the automaton . for fixed @xmath82 , to each vertex @xmath83 of @xmath81 is associated the total hilbert space @xmath84 of the ordered tensor product of @xmath82 irreps of @xmath2 ( at @xmath0 root of unity ) , together with a particular binary coupling scheme @xmath85 of the @xmath82 angular momenta @xmath86 elements of the set @xmath87 .",
    "different vertices correspond to different binary coupling schemes and admit a realization in terms of unrooted binary trees whose nodes are labeled with @xmath2 irreps . the edges @xmath88 of @xmath81",
    "are associated with unitary evolutions connecting vertices ( hilbert spaces ) belonging to @xmath89 .",
    "a restriction is imposed on the type of allowed elementary unitary evolutions for the states in @xmath84 : they can be either _",
    "braid_-like or _",
    "the former are associated with a unitary representation of the braiding between two adjacent leaves of the binary tree ; the latter are associated with reconfigurations of the binary coupling structure of the tree .",
    "the graph @xmath81 is constructed in such a way that two vertices are connected by an edge if and only if there exist a _ braid_-like or a _ recoupling_-like unitary evolution mapping a state of the first vertex to a state of the second vertex ( see fig.[[fig : qtr2 ] ] ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that it is possible to construct a finite - state quantum automaton able to process the language generated by the braid group @xmath90 .",
    "each graphical realization of the quantum automaton can be mapped onto a path in @xmath81 .",
    "the input - word to the automaton is an element @xmath91 and determines the evolution of the automaton according to its image @xmath92 , a unitary representation of @xmath90 , which constitutes the transition rule .",
    "the evolution of the automaton is a sequence of allowed moves on @xmath81 , as depicted in fig.[[fig : path2 ] ] .",
    "the main result in @xcite is that the probability amplitude for the automaton evolution associated to the unitary representation of a braid , whose closure is a particular link @xmath29 , is equal to the colored jones polynomial of @xmath29 .",
    "this result is based on the work of r. kaul @xcite .",
    "the details of the construction of the unitary representations of @xmath90 will be summarized in the next section .",
    "the connection between the spin - network computational model , the theory of quantum automata and link invariants will allow us to provide a quantum algorithm for the efficient approximation of topological invariants of knots .",
    "the advantage of using the spin network quantum automaton resides in its transition rules , which can be straightforwardly expressed in the @xmath0-deformed co - algebra recoupling scheme .",
    "the latter naturally provides the set of unitary operations which are the building blocks of the quantum circuit evaluating the invariants .",
    "previous discussion was aimed to mapping the problem of evaluating link invariants into the problem of simulating the corresponding evolution of the quantum automaton and considering henceforth the two problems as equivalent .",
    "in this section we provide a quantum algorithm that efficiently approximates the value of the colored jones polynomial .",
    "the interest in this problem stems from the fact that an additive approximation of the jones polynomial is sufficient to simulate any polynomial quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the construction of the algorithm involves three different contexts :    1 .   a topological context , where the problem is well defined and which allows us to recast the initial instance from the topological language of knot theory to the algebraic language of braid group theory ; 2 .   a field theoretic context , where tools from cs topological field theory and wzw conformal field theory are used to provide a unitary representation of the braid group ; 3 .   a quantum information context , where the basic features of quantum computation are used to efficiently solve the original problem formulated in a field theoretic language .",
    "we shall not discuss the topological context itself , where theorems and algorithms are available to relate links and braids , and refer the interested reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the field theoretic context will be discussed in the first subsection .",
    "the second subsection will deal with the basic structure of the algorithm and its computational complexity . in the last subsection",
    "we shall complete the proof of efficiency and we shall provide notions needed to completely characterize the algorithm .      in @xcite r. kaul provides a unitary representation of the braid group and develops a method to evaluate observables in @xmath2 cs field theory on the 3-sphere @xmath10 .",
    "his construction is based on the relationship between cs theory on a three - manifold with boundary and the induced wzw conformal field theory on the boundary .",
    "let us consider a three - manifold @xmath93 with a number @xmath82 of two dimensional boundaries @xmath94 .",

    "we can associate to each @xmath95 an hilbert space @xmath98 .",
    "the cs functional integral over @xmath93 is then given as a state in the tensor product of such hilbert spaces .",
    "following the literature , in this section we shall henceforth denote by @xmath99 the quantum group @xmath2 with @xmath100 ; in the following we shall use both expressions interchangeably .",

    "here @xmath146 and @xmath147 are numbers depending on the integer @xmath14 ( @xmath148 and @xmath149 $ ] ) , @xmath150 is the number of link components and @xmath151 is the signature of the linking matrix of @xmath29 .",
    "the linking matrix @xmath152 of a framed link @xmath29 is a symmetric matrix whose entry @xmath153 for @xmath154 is the linking number between components @xmath17 and @xmath25 of @xmath29 .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath152 are defined to be the integers that give the framing of the individual components .",
    "the linking matrix , defined here in combinatorial terms , is related to the topology of @xmath139 because its determinant ( if it is non  zero ) is the order of the first homology group of the manifolds .      in the framework of thurston s geometrization program @xcite ( all three dimensional manifolds can be reconstructed starting from eight types of model geometries ) ,",
    "hyperbolic @xmath4manifolds play a special role . recall that a @xmath4manifold is hyperbolic if it is endowed with a complete riemannian metric with constant negative sectional curvature .",
    "the most interesting case is that of complete hyperbolic manifolds with finite volume ( the volume being evaluated in the given metric ) since the mostow rigidity theorem asserts that any two such manifolds are homeomorphic if and only if they are homotopically equivalent ( we refer to @xcite for details and original references ) .",
    "typical instances of such manifolds are obtained as quotients of the hyperbolic @xmath4space @xmath155 by discrete subgroups of the full isometry group of @xmath155 .",
    "consider the set of all complete hyperbolic @xmath4manifolds with a finite volume .",
    "then the set of volumes is totally ordered ; moreover there exist only finitely many different hyperbolic @xmath4manifolds with the same volume @xcite .",
    "thus the volume of an hyperbolic manifold ( unlike what happens in the euclidean and elliptic cases ) can be considered as a topological invariant .",
    "computer geometry is the branch of geometric topology devoted to the calculation of these invariants : it still exhibits many open problems interesting for a quantum - computational approach but it is most intriguing that such a hard ` computational ' approach raised discussions among mathematicians about the `` philosophical '' question of the effectiveness of mathematical proofs .    at first sight",
    "the above remarks on hyperbolic volumes does not seem related to our central issue of colored quantum invariant of @xmath4manifolds .",
    "however this is not the case : a connection can be easily recognized by observing that most manifolds obtained by surgery on framed knots ( links ) in the @xmath4sphere can be endowed with hyperbolic metrics .",
    "let us focus for example on ` hyperbolic knots ' , namely those knots which give rise by surgery to ( finite volume ) hyperbolic @xmath4manifolds : the ` volume conjecture ' proposed by @xcite ( see also the review @xcite for extended versions ) can be cast in this case in the form @xmath156 where @xmath24 is a hyperbolic knot and the notation @xmath157 stands for the @xmath126colored polynomial of @xmath24 evaluated at @xmath158 .",
    "notice that all the quantum algorithms dealing with link polynomials are established for a fixed choice of the root of unity @xmath0 appearing in the argument of the invariants , while the volume conjecture involves the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of ` single - colored ' polynomial of the same knot for increasing values of the coloring itself .",
    "recently , aharonov and arad @xcite have addressed an asymptotic analysis ( @xmath159 ) for the jones polynomial , still @xmath42colored .",
    "it would be interesting to explore the possibility of borrowing some of their techniques to test the conjecture ( [ volcon ] ) within the computational framework designed for colored polynomials ."
