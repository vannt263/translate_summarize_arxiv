    "as has been shown by a. sakharov @xcite , the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be generated dynamically , provided that the following three conditions are fulfilled : violation of baryon ( or baryon minus lepton ) number ; violation of _ c _ and _ cp _ ; and deviation from thermal equilibrium .",
    "the third sakharov condition raises the question of how to describe a quantum system out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the usual choice is the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "however , it is known to have several shortcomings . in particular classical boltzmann equations",
    "neglect off  shell effects , introduce irreversibility and feature spurious constants of motion .",
    "a quantum mechanical generalization of the boltzmann equation , free of the mentioned problems , has been developed by l. kadanoff and g. baym @xcite .",
    "direct numerical computations demonstrate that already for simple systems far from thermal equilibrium the kadanoff  baym and boltzmann equations do lead to quantitatively , and in some cases even qualitatively , different results @xcite . studying processes responsible for the generation of the asymmetry in the framework of the kadanoff ",
    "baym formalism is therefore of considerable scientific interest .    the application of the kadanoff ",
    "baym equations to the computation of the lepton and baryon asymmetries in the leptogenesis scenario @xcite has been studied at different levels of approximation by several authors @xcite and lead to qualitatively new and interesting results .",
    "however issues related to the rapid expansion of the universe , which drives the required deviation from thermal equilibrium , have not been addressed there .",
    "the modification of the kadanoff ",
    "baym formalism in curved space ",
    "time has been considered in @xcite , where it was applied to a model with quartic self  interactions and a @xmath0 model , though the dynamics of quantum field theoretical models with _",
    "violation remained uninvestigated .",
    "our goal is to develop a consistent description of leptogenesis in the kadanoff  baym and boltzmann approaches and to test approximations commonly made in the computation of the lepton and baryon asymmetries . in particular , we want to find out how the dense background plasma and the curvature of spacetime affect the collision terms of processes contributing to the generation and washout of the asymmetry , check the applicability of the real intermediate state subtraction procedure in the case of resonant leptogenesis @xcite , and investigate the time dependence of the _ cp_violating parameter in the expanding universe @xcite .    since this is a rather ambitious goal , we first study a simple toy model of leptogenesis containing two real and one complex scalar fields , which mimic the heavy right  handed majorana neutrinos and leptons respectively @xcite .",
    "the peculiarities of the calculation , related to the presence of a gravitational field , are determined only by transformation properties of the quantum fields  scalar fields in this case .",
    "for this reason , in the present paper , we use a model of a single real scalar field with quartic self  interactions , minimally coupled to gravity , to illustrate the main points .",
    "that is , we use the lagrangian @xmath1 which does also have the advantage , that one can compare the derived equations with their minkowski space ",
    "time counterparts @xcite and with the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "the formalism presented here will be used to analyze the toy model of leptogenesis .",
    "the starting point of our analysis , which is manifestly covariant in every step , is the generating functional for the ( connected ) green s functions . performing a legendre transformation",
    "we get the effective action , which we use to derive the schwinger ",
    "dyson equations in sec.[schwdyson ] . these are equivalent to a system of kadanoff ",
    "baym equations for the spectral function and the statistical propagator , which we derive in sec.[kb ] . employing a first  order gradient expansion and a wigner transformation",
    "we are lead to a system of quantum kinetic equations which we study in sec.[qk ] . finally ,",
    "neglecting the poisson brackets and making use of the quasiparticle approximation , we obtain the boltzmann equation in sec.[be ] .    * the kadanoff ",
    "baym equations and the derived boltzmann equation are covariant generalizations of their minkowski  space counterparts . *",
    "the space - time metric enters its left - hand side in the form of the covariant derivative , whereas the collision terms on the right - hand side are independent of the metric .",
    "* at tree - level the collision terms coincide with those calculated in vacuum , whereas the loop corrections contain integrals over the distribution function . * in the loop contributions one can clearly distinguish the initial , final and on  shell intermediate states , which is not the case in the canonical formalism .",
    "we discuss these results in more details and draw the conclusions in sec.[summary ] .",
