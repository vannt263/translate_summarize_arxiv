    "one of the earliest results in quantum information theory was the realization in @xcite that a noisy quantum channel can be used to establish secret correlations whose security is guaranteed by the fundamental laws of physics .",
    "furthermore , while the full - scale implementation of quantum computation is likely to remain a distant hope for years to come , secure quantum key distribution protocols may begin to play an important role in the world of information security in the not - too - distant future .    in the simplest case of independent and identically distributed noise , which we will consider here and to which most quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocols",
    "can be reduced @xcite , the capacity of a channel for private classical communication was studied in @xcite . in that work ,",
    "a _ multi - letter formula _ for the private classical capacity was provided ( and , indeed , a similar formula for a channel s capacity for quantum communication ) .",
    "unfortunately , this multi - letter formula can not be evaluated in general , and thus provides only a partial characterization of the capacity we seek .    in lieu of a closed form expression for the private classical capacity of a quantum channel , which we will call @xmath0",
    ", it is the primary purpose of this work to provide upper bounds . in particular",
    ", we will consider the capacity of a quantum channel for private classical communication when assisted by the family of ( one - way ) quantum channels that map symmetrically to their output and environment . since any such channel has zero private capacity on its own",
    ", one would expect the resulting bound to be quite tight .",
    "this approach is very much in the spirit of @xcite , and in fact our expression for the symmetric side - channel assisted private capacity ( ss - private capacity ) shares many of the nice properties of the ss - capacity found there , namely it is single - letter , additive , and convex .",
    "a secondary goal of this work is to explore the connection between unconditional privacy and quantum coherence , which has long been folklore in the quantum information community and provided motivation for the coding theorems proved in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "while this analogy is quite useful , it is known that the correspondence is not exact . indeed , there are quantum channels for which the capacity for private communicaton and quantum communication are quite different . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that there exist quantum states from which no entanglement can be distilled via two - way classical communication but which nevertheless can be used to create secure key via one - way public classical communication .",
    "this leads to examples of channels with zero quantum capacity but nonzero private classical capacity .    understanding",
    "the connection between coherence and privacy in a quantitative way does not seem to be possible at the moment , as there do not yet exist simple expressions for either the private classical or quantum capacities of a channel .",
    "however , we will show below that , for the class of channels known as _ degradable _ , it is possible to find a simple expression for the private classical capacity , @xmath0 , and indeed for such channels @xmath0 is exactly the quantum capacity ( which , due to @xcite has a closed - form expression ) .",
    "as well as giving the first examples of nontrivial channels for which @xmath0 can be found explicitly , this provides a setting in which the above mentioned analogy between privacy and coherence can be made exact .",
    "furthermore , the ss - private - capacity of a degradable channel is exactly equal to its ( unassisted ) quantum capacity .",
    "we will combine this result with the convexity of the ss - private capacity to provide a new technique for upper - bounding the private capacity of a general quantum channel , extending the current best known bounds for the quantum capacity of the depolarizing to its private capacity and providing new bounds for private capacity of a channel with independent phase and amplitude noise .",
    "this last result leads to collective attacks on bb84 that outperform the optimal individual attack .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we study the private capacity of a degradable channel , in section iii we provide a single - letter formula for the ss - private capacity of a general channel , while in section iv we provide upper bounds for the private capacity of some specific quantum channels and discuss their relation to collective attacks in qkd . in section",
    "v we mention a few open problems .",
    "in a classical setting , if we imagine a broadcast channel which maps @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the output to the receiver and @xmath4 is the output of an eavesdropper , it was shown in @xcite that the secret - key capacity of @xmath1 is exactly @xmath5 here the optimization is over a reference variable @xmath6 , which represents the distribution of messages sent through the channel , together with a noisy processing of @xmath6 that generates @xmath7 .    by analogy with this result",
    ", one may imagine that the private classical capacity of a quantum channel would be given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 with @xmath10 an isometric extension of @xmath1 ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) .",
    "so , the optimization would again be taken over input random variable @xmath6 ( this time with a choice of basis ) , together with a classical noisy processing @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , the coding theorem proved in @xcite showed that this rate is in fact achievable :    @xmath13    but did not establish the converse statement . instead , it was shown that @xmath14 evidence was found in @xcite that this regularization , as the limit over @xmath15 is typically called in this context , is necessary in general .",
    "a class of channels for which we will be able to explicitly evaluate @xmath0 are called degradable , and were defined in @xcite in analogy with the classical notion of a degraded broadcast channel @xcite .",

    "below , we will prove that the private classical capacity of a degradable channel is equal to its quantum capacity .",
    "the quantum capacity is , in turn , equal to the single - letter optimized coherent information .",
    "this result is very much in line with the findings of @xcite , in which it was shown that in the classical case if @xmath4 is a degraded version of @xmath3 , the noisy processing in eq .",

    "this implies that @xmath27 since @xmath1 is degradable , and conditional mutual information is monotonic under local operations ( lo ) when the system conditioned on is classical ( an immediate consequence of the lo monotonicity of mutual information , itself a consequence of strong subadditivity ) , we have @xmath28 , so that @xmath29    the following lemma , which shows that @xmath30 is additive for degradable channels , was proved in @xcite .",

    "we can also write the @xmath161 as a convex combination of dephasing channels with dephasing probability @xmath162 , which results in slightly tighter bounds for very small noise ( i.e. , @xmath163 ) .",
    "our combined upper bound on key rate is given by @xmath164 and tightens the previous best bounds of @xcite ( which considered only protocols without noisy processing ) , and the ( straight line ) bound found in @xcite for all @xmath165 ( see figure [ fig : bb84 ] ) .",
    "the fact that we surpass the bound of @xcite is particularly interesting , since it is also an _ achievable _ key rate against an adversary restricted to individual attacks .",
    "our bound thus shows that a completely general attack is strictly stronger than an individual attack .",

    "it is also a convex combination of three dephasing channels with error probability @xmath148 .",
    "finally , the secret key capacity is zero whenever a channel is antidegradable , which happens at @xmath167 @xcite , so that the convexity of @xmath74 then implies @xmath168 where we have let @xmath169 if @xmath170 and @xmath171 otherwise .",
    "this expression is equal to the upper bound on the depolarizing channel s _ quantum _ capacity found in @xcite , so that the best known upper bounds for this channel actually coincide .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the bound on the threshold for the six - state protocol reported in @xcite is strictly stronger than the @xmath172 threshold implied by our bound .",
    "however , the @xcite bound _ does not _ apply to the private capacity of the depolarizing channel , since it is valid only for a restricted set of input states .    for comparison with the qkd literature , note",
    "that the relationship between quantum bit error rate , @xmath173 , and depolarizing error probability , @xmath148 , is @xmath174 .    .",
    "the lower curve is the best known achievable key rate from @xcite .",
    "the upper curve is the `` optimal eavesdropping'' bound on bb84 ( _ without _ noisy processing ) found in @xcite , representing the best possible individual attack .",
    "the middle curve is our upper bound from eq .",

    "this is a convex combination of dephasing - like channels with error probability @xmath184 , which are degradable and have a private capacity of @xmath185 , so that by theorem [ thm : dmub ] we have the result .",
    "it is not entirely clear how to best decompose a pauli channel into a convex combination of amplitude damping channels , but it seems likely that such a decomposition ( or perhaps a decomposition into channels with two kraus operators ) would outperform the current bound for high noise levels .      in this subsection we describe how the above upper bounds on the private capacity correspond to collective attacks on quantum key distribution protocols .",
    "consider the decomposition of a channel @xmath1 into a convex combination of degradable channels , @xmath133 : @xmath186 where we will call the isometric extension of @xmath133 @xmath187 .",
    "the attack associated with this decomposition is as follows : for each signal state sent , eve applies @xmath188 with probability @xmath189 , sends the @xmath190 system to bob , and stores her various @xmath191 systems until the end of the protocol .",
    "after the protocol is complete , eve collects all of her @xmath191 systems associated with @xmath133 and ( jointly ) measures which of the typical eigenvectors of @xmath192 the state is in . because @xmath133 is degradable",
    ", we can calculate exactly how much secret key alice and bob can distill from the resulting state  they can get a key rate of exactly @xmath193 . because a fraction @xmath194 of the signal states are subjected to @xmath133 ,",

    "we have studied the capacity of a quantum channel for private classical communication when assisted by symmetric channel of an arbitrary size . for a general channel , we found a single letter formula that , unfortunately , involves an optimization over an auxiliary space that is a prior unbounded .",
    "for degradable channels , we further showed that this optimization can be performed explicitly , and in fact the ss - private capacity of such a channel is exactly equal to its single - letter optimized coherent information .",
    "using this fact , together with the convexity of the ss - capacity for general channels , we showed how to find upper bounds on the ( unassisted ) private capacity of a general channel , and provided such bounds for two channels of interest for quantum key distribution .",
    "the most important question we have left unanswered is whether it is possible to bound the dimension of the symmetric channel necessary to achieve the optimum of the ss - capacity formula found in theorem [ thm : sscap ] .",
    "this could allow very tight bounds on the unassisted capacity .",
    "in fact , we are unaware of any channel for which the ss - private capacity and unassisted private capacity differ , and the conjecture that they are the same is equivalent to the additivity of the unassisted capacity , @xmath0 .",
    "we note that for both the independent amplitude and phase noise and the depolarizing channel , the upper bounds are the convex hull of a bound based on decomposition into dephasing channels , which is strongest in the low noise regime , and a decompostion into amplitude damping channels , which is stronger in the high noise regime .",
    "this suggests that the best collective attacks on quantum key distribution protocols will be qualitatively different in the high and low noise regimes .",
    "it is an interesting question whether there are zero capacity degradable channels that are not antidegradable .",
    "this possibility is intriguing , since the best known bounds on the zeros of the capacity of most channels come from a no - cloning argument ( which is essentially to observe that the channel is antidegradable ) , but these bounds are usually not particularly close to the corresponding lower bounds .",
    "such a channel would also be useful for improving estimates on @xmath142 for general channels .",
    "finally , this work demonstrates ( along with @xcite ) that assistance from a symmetric side channel is a `` nice '' resource , in the sense that it provides a marked simplification over the unassisted case for the private capacity .",
    "further examples of nice resources are free epr pairs , which lead to the single - letter formula for the entanglement assisted capacity of @xcite , and ppt - preserving operations , which dramatically simplify the theory of entanglement manipulations @xcite .",
    "what are the other `` nice '' resources ?",
