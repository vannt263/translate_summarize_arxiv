    "the present paper deals with discrete time reversible markov chains on finite state sets .",
    "let @xmath6 be a finite set of cardinality @xmath35 , @xmath0 a markov process on @xmath6 , and @xmath2 its transition matrix of transition probabilities @xmath36 : @xmath37 is the conditional probability that the chain is in the state @xmath38 at time @xmath39 given that it was in the state @xmath40 at time @xmath41 . note that these transition probabilities themselves do not depend on time .",
    "probabilities are conserved so that @xmath42 for all @xmath40 : @xmath2 is _",
    "stochastic_.    we define the state vector @xmath43 at time @xmath41 : it has coordinates @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the probability that the chain is in the state @xmath38 at time @xmath41 . then by definition of the matrix @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath46 a state vector @xmath47 is said to be an equilibrium ( or stationary ) distribution if @xmath48 , in other words if is an eigenstate of @xmath2 with eigenvalue 1 .    the markov process @xmath0 is said to be reversible if it satisfies the detailed balance condition  @xcite @xmath49 for all states @xmath38 and @xmath40 .",
    "this condition ensures that @xmath47 is effectively an equilibrium distribution for @xmath0",
    ". it will be useful in the following .",
    "furthermore , we suppose that this equilibrium distribution @xmath47 exists and is unique ( see for instance @xcite for further detail on this point ) .",
    "in addition , we assume in the sequel that the `` loop '' transitions @xmath50 are at least @xmath51 for all states @xmath38 .      we basically assume for the moment that @xmath52 for all states @xmath38 : the chain can reach any state at equilibrium .",
    "then we define the scalar product : @xmath53 because of reversibility , @xmath2 is self - adjoint for this scalar product : @xmath54 thus the eigenvalues @xmath55 , @xmath56 , of @xmath2 are real .",
    "moreover , @xmath57 for all @xmath58 by standard perron - frobenius theory  @xcite . since the equilibrium distribution exists and is unique , @xmath59 and @xmath60 in addition , we have supposed that @xmath61 for all @xmath38 . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath62 is also a transition matrix with non - negative transition probabilities , the eigenvalues @xmath63 of which are larger than @xmath64 according to ( [ ordrevap ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath65 for all @xmath58 .",
    "now we can define the _ spectral gap _ of @xmath2 : @xmath66      in the introduction , we claimed that the characteristic time @xmath1 to be close to equilibrium is of order @xmath3 , whatever the initial probability distribution @xmath67 .",
    "let us precise this point and in particular what we mean by `` close '' .",
    "if the chain was in the state @xmath68 at time 0 , we denote by @xmath69 the state vector at time @xmath41 .    in the literature ,",
    "the distance between the probability distribution @xmath69 and the equilibrium one @xmath47 can be measured by various means . among them , two norms are commonly used , the euclidean norm associated with the above scalar product and the 1-norm or _",
    "variation distance _",
    "@xcite : @xmath70 note that @xmath71 where @xmath72 ( resp .",
    "@xmath73 ) is the probability that the system is in the subset @xmath74 of @xmath6 at time @xmath41 ( resp . at equilibrium ) .",
    "then given @xmath75 , we define the _ mixing _ time @xmath76 associated with this distance : @xmath77 in other words , whatever the initial state @xmath38 , one is sure to stay within distance @xmath78 of equilibrium after @xmath79 steps . then elementary algebra ( see e.g.  @xcite ) shows that : @xmath80 this upper bound is of order @xmath3 even though the second term of the prefactor of @xmath3 can be substantially big .",
    "however , this second term is usually polynomial in the system size , at least at high temperature , where the distribution @xmath47 is uniform : this second term is simply the entropy of the system and if it is extensive , it is polynomial in the system size .",
    "if @xmath3 is also polynomial , the dynamics remains rapid .",
    "the reader can refer to wilson  @xcite for an interesting discussion on this point .    on the contrary , at vanishing temperature ,",
    "only the low energy levels are occupied and some probabilities @xmath81 tend to zero and this second term diverges , even for finite systems .",
    "this is not physically relevant , since @xmath82 remains finite in general .",
    "the previous upper bound ( [ epsvar ] ) is not adapted .",
    "should we have chosen the euclidean norm to measure the distance under interest , we would have been led to the similar conclusion that the equilibriation time is of order @xmath3 ( see also @xcite for further discussion ) . in the sequel of this paper , we shall focus on spectral gaps rather than such equilibriation times .",
    "generally speaking , given a discrete time markov chain @xmath0 on a finite set @xmath6 , a decomposition  @xcite of @xmath0 is both a partition of @xmath6 in disjoint subsets @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and a new natural dynamical rule on @xmath6 .",
    "this dynamical rule is defined by its transition matrix @xmath83 as follows : for all @xmath84 , if @xmath38 and @xmath40 belong to the same subset @xmath7 then @xmath85 , else @xmath86 .",
    "we say that we `` cut transitions between the different subsets @xmath7 '' .",
    "the diagonal terms @xmath87 are suitably modified to ensure that @xmath83 remains stochastic .",
    "if @xmath88 denotes the restriction of @xmath83 to @xmath7 , then @xmath83 is block - diagonal and it is the direct sum of the @xmath88 : @xmath89 we naturally suppose that the decomposition is designed so that each subset @xmath7 is connected with respect to the new dynamical rule and that for each @xmath7 seen in isolation , there also exists a unique stationary distribution .",
    "then the equilibrium state of @xmath83 is degenerate of dimension @xmath74 .",
    "we call @xmath83 the _ restriction _ of @xmath2 to the decomposition @xmath90 .    as it was announced in introduction",
    ", we shall consider the case where we have @xmath10 different decompositions @xmath11 , @xmath91 .",
    "_ a priori _ , the different @xmath92 need not to be equal .",
    "then we define as above @xmath10 different restrictions for each decomposition @xmath16 , denoted by @xmath93 .",
    "we say that we have a multi - decomposition or a @xmath10-decomposition .",
    "now we need to introduce a property of regularity .",
    "we say that a transition of the original chain @xmath94 `` belongs '' to the decomposition @xmath16 if @xmath95 , in other words if this transition is not cut in that decomposition .    * definition * _ a @xmath10-decomposition @xmath11 of @xmath0 is said to be _ regular _ if there exists an integer @xmath96 such that each transition @xmath94 belongs to exactly @xmath97 decompositions .",
    "the integer @xmath97 is called the _ redundancy _ of the regular multi - decomposition . _    if the @xmath10-decomposition is regular of redundancy @xmath97 then we have the following simple but important relation : @xmath98 which interconnects the different decompositions  @xcite .",
    "the second term of the sum restores the diagonal coefficients @xmath50 .",
    "note that the restriction of @xmath0 to each subset @xmath13 of each decomposition remains reversible , because if @xmath36 is cut , then @xmath36 is also cut : @xmath99 in addition , @xmath47 remains a stationary distribution for each @xmath93 , but it is not unique ; we denote by @xmath100 the eigenspace of eigenvectors of @xmath93 corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 .",
    "its dimension is @xmath92 because we also suppose that on each subset @xmath13 there is a unique stationary distribution .",
    "equation  ( [ balance.k ] ) also leads us to the conclusion that @xmath93 remains self - adjoint for the scalar product ( [ scalprod ] ) . if we denote by @xmath101 the orthogonal projection ( with respect to this scalar product ) onto @xmath100 , then any eigenvector ( other than vectors of @xmath100 ) projects onto @xmath102 .",
    "we define the _ multi - projection _ : @xmath103 then @xmath104 . we say that the multi - decomposition is _ non - degenerate _ if this eigenvector is non - degenerate himself , which is satisfied in practice .",
    "we denote by @xmath105 the second largest eigenvalue of @xmath106 ( in modulus ) and we call it the _ norm of the multi - projection @xmath106_. in the following , the difficult step will often be to calculate this norm .",
    "we shall discuss this point in subsection  [ howto ] and give several examples in sections  [ e.examples ] , [ urn ] and [ ctp ] .",
    "* definition * _ a non - degenerate @xmath10-decomposition , which is regular of redundancy @xmath97 and which has an associated multi - projection of norm @xmath105 , is called a non - degenerate @xmath107-multi - decomposition . _",
    "the eigenspace @xmath100 of @xmath93 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath108 is degenerate : we denote by @xmath109 the difference between 1 and the second largest eigenvalue of @xmath93 ( strictly smaller than 1 ) .",
    "[ th1 ] let @xmath2 be the transition matrix of a markov chain @xmath0 on @xmath6 and @xmath110 be a non - degenerate @xmath107-multi - decomposition of @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath93 denotes the restriction of @xmath2 to the decomposition @xmath111 , then the following _ gap relation _ holds : @xmath112    _ proof : _ for the sake of convenience , we work in this proof with the matrix :    @xmath113    at the end of the calculation , the gap of @xmath2 will simply be : @xmath114 .    given a state vector @xmath115 , we note @xmath116 ( the superscript `` eq '' stands for `` equilibrium '' ) ; @xmath117 depends on @xmath14 and @xmath115 , since the eigenspace of @xmath93 corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 is degenerate .",
    "all the difficulty in the following lies in this degeneracy .",
    "we suppose now that we have sorted altogether all the eigenvalues of the @xmath10 matrices @xmath93 : @xmath118 .",

    ", we list several examples where this calculation is feasible exactly .",
    "the idea is to construct a matrix which has the same eigenvalues as @xmath106 , which is much smaller than @xmath106 and the elements of which depend only on the equilibrium distribution @xmath47 and the subsets @xmath13 .",
    "this is an important point : @xmath105 is calculated _ at equilibrium _ and the spectral gap of @xmath2 , that is its _ dynamical _ rate of convergence , is eventually monitored by this _ equilibrium _ quantity .",
    "however , even in the cases where this calculation is out of reach , the present technique is also a great advance as compared to direct diagonalization of the matrix @xmath2 to obtain @xmath5 , because in order to calculate @xmath105 numerically , one has to diagonalize a much smaller matrix than @xmath2 .",
    "this point of view is used at the end of section  [ ctp ] to support a conjecture about the `` contingency table problem '' .    as it was already remarked in section  [ defs ] , given a decomposition , @xmath138 , since the different subsets have been `` disconnected '' , the vector space @xmath100 of eigenstates corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 is degenerate of dimension @xmath92 . in order to write the projections @xmath139 , which belong to @xmath100",

    "( [ pibar ] ) .",
    "the dimension of the square matrix @xmath162 is @xmath151 .",

    "its coefficients are : @xmath169 the same kind of transformation can also be used in the case where @xmath47 is not uniform : @xmath170 this is the conditional probability , at equilibrium , that the system is in the subset @xmath13 given that it is in the subset @xmath17 .",
    "in this section , we display several examples where the multi - decomposition technique is particularly efficient . in these three examples , the lower bound provided by the method",
    "can be compared to exact values of the gap calculated by independent means . in these three cases ,",
    "the lower bound of theorem  [ th1 ] turns out to be an equality .",
    "we consider a random walker on a @xmath10-dimensional hyper - cube .",
    "we first derive exactly the spectral gap of this markov chain .",
    "then we prove that the lower bound provided by the multi - decomposition method is in fact an equality .    our random walker moves on the vertices of a cube , @xmath171 .",
    "he moves through the edges of the cube .",
    "his position is denoted by @xmath172 . at each step",
    ", he chooses randomly an index @xmath58 among @xmath10 as well as a direction @xmath173 .",
    "if the move @xmath174 is possible then he performs this move , else he stays at the same place .",
    "the allowed transition rates are all equal to @xmath175 .",
    "then the transition matrix @xmath176 of this chain can be written as a tensor product of @xmath10 one - dimensional walkers on @xmath177 : @xmath178 because the walker can choose one of the @xmath10 directions with equal probability @xmath179 and then it performs a one - dimensional walk in that direction .",
    "the transition matrix of each one - dimensional walker in the direction @xmath14 is @xmath180 the eigenvalues of @xmath41 are 1 and 0 , and @xmath181 .",
    "we now use the multi - decomposition technique in order to compare the obtained lower bound to this exact value : we relate the spectral gap of @xmath176 to that of a random walker on a @xmath30-dimensional hyper - cube @xmath182",
    ". there are @xmath10 natural ways to build the decompositions , by preventing moves in one ( and only one ) of the @xmath10 directions of space .",
    "then there are 2 subsets in each decomposition , and they are isomorphic to a hyper - cube @xmath182",
    ".    furthermore , each transition belongs to exactly @xmath183 decompositions among @xmath10 , more precisely to every decomposition save the one where this transition is forbidden .",
    "therefore this multi - decomposition is regular of redundancy @xmath183 .",
    "now we consider the multi - projection associated with this multi - decomposition .",
    "let us prove with the help of relation  ( [ uniform ] ) ( and theorem  [ th2 ] ) that its norm @xmath184 . in this case , @xmath185 , the cardinality of a @xmath30-dimensional hyper - cube , for all @xmath12 and all @xmath186 ; and @xmath187 whenever @xmath188 .",
    "hence @xmath189 if @xmath190 and @xmath162 is a block - matrix of @xmath191 blocks .",
    "diagonal blocks are equal to the identity and non - diagonal ones to @xmath41 .",
    "it is an elementary exercise to compute the eigenvalues of such a matrix : @xmath10 is the largest eigenvalue , 1 is @xmath10 times degenerate , and the @xmath183 remaining eigenvalues are equal to 0 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath192 .",
    "according to theorem  [ th1 ] , @xmath193 .",
    "all matrices @xmath93 have the same gap .",
    "now it is time to draw the reader s attention to the following important point : the ( allowed ) non - diagonal transition rates in matrices @xmath176 and @xmath93 are equal . therefore @xmath93 is the direct sum ( see eq .",
    "( [ sommedir ] ) ) of 2 transition matrices of a @xmath30-dimensional random walker , but with non - diagonal transition rates @xmath175 instead of @xmath194 in @xmath195 . as a consequence , @xmath196 and @xmath197 here , the lower bound calculated _ via _",
    "the multi - decomposition technique is the exact spectral gap .",
    "we extend this calculation to the case considered in introduction , where the @xmath10-dimensional box @xmath198 is not necessarily a cube any longer .",
    "its side lengths are denoted by @xmath199 .",
    "we follow the same line as in the previous example except that now @xmath200 .",
    "however , before going on , we need to clarify the question of boundary conditions , which was temporarily postponed in the introduction . in fact , we shall demonstrate the following striking property : the details of the proof do not depend precisely on boundary conditions provided the subsets @xmath13 are the same , as well as the stationary distribution @xmath47 .",
    "this is the first illustration of a general feature of the multi - decomposition technique that was already mentioned in section  [ howto ] , and that will be largely discussed in the following sections : @xmath105 is an equilibrium quantity .",
    "we consider both `` von neumann '' and periodic boundary conditions . in the first case , and as in our previous example , if the walker tries to move outside the grid , he stays at the same place . in the second case ,",
    "the grid lies on a torus and the walker has always @xmath201 possible moves ; all the vertices play the same role . in both cases , the allowed transition rates are equal to @xmath202 . as compared to the previous examples , where they were set to @xmath175 , these transition rates ensure that @xmath61 ( in the previous example , this property was due the the fact that all vertices lay on the boundary ) .",
    "the exact calculation of the gap of the transition matrix @xmath176 is similar to the previous one : @xmath176 can also be written as a tensor product of @xmath10 one - dimensional walkers ( eq .",
    "( [ tensorprod ] ) ) , since the walker chooses one of the @xmath10 directions with equal probability and performs a one - dimensional walk in that direction .",
    "however , the transition matrix @xmath203 of the one - dimensional walker now depends both on the side length @xmath26 and the boundary conditions . for von neumann ones ,",
    "@xmath204 is a @xmath205 matrix .",
    "its eigenvalues are @xmath206 , where @xmath207 .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath176 are the tensor products of the one - dimensional ones and its eigenvalues are all the combinations @xmath208 if @xmath209 , the second largest eigenvalue is obtained when all the @xmath210 s are set to 0 except for the @xmath211-th one which is set to 1 .",
    "thus @xmath212 . in the case of periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "a similar calculation leads to @xmath213 , with @xmath214 instead of @xmath203 .",
    "we now decompose the @xmath10-dimensional walker in @xmath30-dimensional ones ( figure  [ walker3d ] ) .",
    "the argument is exactly the same as in the previous section  [ mdimcube ] , except that @xmath109 now depends on @xmath14 since @xmath26 does . for each @xmath14 , the decomposition @xmath215 is obtained by cutting the edges in the direction @xmath14 of the grid . for both boundary conditions , this results in constraining the walker to move on a @xmath30-dimensional grid , with the same boundary conditions as in the original grid @xmath198 .",
    "in addition , the matrix @xmath162 ( or @xmath216 ) is slightly more complex : we calculate @xmath217 whenever @xmath190 , whatever @xmath15 and @xmath218 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath216 can also be exactly calculated and one also gets @xmath192 . the redundancy is @xmath219 as it is in the previous example .",
    "theorem  [ th1 ] can be applied and one gets the gap relation @xmath220 .",
    "we recall that @xmath93 is the direct sum ( see eq .",
    "( [ sommedir ] ) ) of @xmath26 transition matrices of a @xmath30-dimensional random walker , with transition rates @xmath202 instead of @xmath221 .",
    "taking this fact into account , one gets by induction @xmath222 for von neumann boundary conditions .",
    "the exact gap was calculated above and this lower bound is in fact exact .",
    "the conclusion is the same for periodic boundary conditions : since the subsets @xmath13 are the same as in the von neumann case , the matrix @xmath216 is identical for both boundary conditions .",
    "therefore @xmath105 and @xmath97 are also equal in both cases , and the gap relations are identical . finally , the two proof are exactly similar except that the first steps of the proof by induction , that is to say the spectral gaps of the _ one_-dimensional random walkers , differ .",
    "one finally also gets the exact gap calculated above for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this markov chain belongs to the `` card shuffling models ''  @xcite . in this example , we re - derive the spectral gap which is usually calculated by group representation theory arguments @xcite . in this case , the multi - decomposition technique is remarkably simple and efficient and provides again an exact lower bound .    given an integer @xmath223 and the symmetric group @xmath224 , the `` random transposition markov chain ''  @xcite is defined on @xmath225 as follows : given a state ( a permutation ) @xmath226 , pick up uniformly two different positions @xmath14 and @xmath227 at random , then transpose @xmath228 and @xmath229 with probability 1/2 ( so that @xmath61 ) .",
    "this markov chain converges towards the uniform distribution on @xmath224 ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite , it is proven that @xmath231 with arguments based on the theory of representations of @xmath224 ( the result is slightly different in reference  @xcite because transition rates are slightly different )",
    ".    now we decompose the random walk on @xmath224 in random walks on @xmath232 in order to compute inductively the lower bound on the gap .",
    "the decomposition is natural : for a given @xmath12 , we fix the position of @xmath228 and we prevent transpositions involving this index @xmath14 . the subsets @xmath13 are defined by the fixed value @xmath233",
    ". the resulting chain on each @xmath13 is the same as the original one on a set of cardinality @xmath183 , with transition rates @xmath234 $ ] instead of @xmath235 $ ] .",
    "now we calculate @xmath162 : @xmath236 when @xmath190 and @xmath237 . if @xmath190 but @xmath238 , @xmath239 since @xmath228 and @xmath229 can not be equal , and @xmath240 .",
    "hence @xmath162 is a block - matrix with @xmath10 lines and @xmath10 columns of blocks : @xmath241 where each block is itself a @xmath242 matrix and @xmath243 the eigenvalues of @xmath157 are 1 ( non - degenerate ) and @xmath244 , @xmath183 times degenerate , with respective eigenvectors @xmath245 and @xmath246 , @xmath247 .",
    "then one computes the @xmath248 eigenvectors of @xmath162 : the @xmath249 vectors @xmath250 , where @xmath251 , with the same eigenvalue @xmath252 ; the @xmath30 vectors @xmath253 , with eigenvalue @xmath254 ; the @xmath30 vectors @xmath255 with eigenvalue @xmath254 ; and the vector @xmath256 with eigenvalue @xmath10 .",
    "finally , the multi - decomposition is non - degenerate and @xmath257 this value tends to 1 when @xmath10 is large but is not equal to 1 .",
    "this nuance is crucial in order to get the good behavior of the gap with @xmath10 .    on the other hand , this multi - decomposition is regular with redundancy @xmath258 .",
    "indeed , each transposition of indices @xmath14 and @xmath227 is forbidden in exactly two decompositions , namely @xmath16 and @xmath259",
    ". then theorem  [ th1 ] provides the gap relation : @xmath260 taking into account the difference of transition rates in @xmath93 and @xmath195 , we have @xmath261 and @xmath262 because @xmath263 . once again , this bound is the exact gap .",
    "in this section , we show that the multi - decomposition technique can be applied to a sub - class of the larger class of `` urn models ''  @xcite .",
    "the latter have been designed as toy models for glassy dynamics , to which belongs the maybe more notorious `` backgammon model ''  @xcite .",
    "for the first time , we explicitly introduce temperature in our method .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity , we shall essentially focus on dynamics at vanishing temperature @xmath264 .",
    "in urn models , @xmath10 identical urns contain @xmath265 identical ( distinguishable or not ) particles , or balls . in the historical ehrenfest urn model , @xmath266 and @xmath265",
    "then balls can be exchanged from one urn to another , which will define the elementary moves .",
    "the different rules of exchange characterize the different urn models .",
    "in general , they are defined so that the system prefers to have the maximum of empty urns , and eventually only an urn containing all the balls .",
    "usually , these urn models are endowed with a hamiltonian : the energy @xmath267 of a configuration is the number of non - empty boxes .",
    "we shall focus on two different models governed by a metropolis algorithm at @xmath268 based upon the previous hamiltonian .",
    "these two models are identical , except that balls are indistinguishable in the first model and distinguishable in the second one .",
    "we shall see that this difference has dramatic consequences on their dynamics . the first model is usually known as the `` monkey model '' and the second one as the `` backgammon model '' .",
    "their elementary moves are defined as follows :    * `` monkey model ''  @xcite : balls are _ indistinguishable ; _ two distinct urns are chosen uniformly at random among the @xmath10 possible ones , a `` departure '' urn @xmath269 , and an `` arrival '' urn @xmath74 . if a ball can be removed from @xmath269 to @xmath74 without increasing the energy @xmath267 , that is to say if @xmath269 _ and _ @xmath74 are not empty , this move is performed ; * `` backgammon model ''  @xcite : balls are _ distinguishable ; _ among all the balls contained in the @xmath10 urns , one ball @xmath218 is chosen at random and its urn is denoted by @xmath269 .",
    "a second urn is chosen uniformly at random _ among the @xmath183 remaining ones_. denoted by @xmath74 .",
    "the ball @xmath218 is taken from @xmath269 to @xmath74 if this move does not increase the energy ( that is if @xmath74 is not empty ) .    by construction , in both models , the number of empty urns can not but increase . the dynamics is frozen when all the urns are empty save one .",
    "we can already foresee that model ( ii ) will be slower to reach this frozen state than model ( i ) because it is more difficult to empty an urn entirely : when one urn is nearly empty , the ball @xmath218 belongs to the other urns with much higher probability .",
    "note that at @xmath270 , this metropolis algorithm must be modified as follows  @xcite : an elementary move is accepted with probability @xmath271 , where @xmath272 is the energy variation is the move _ was _ accepted .",
    "the canonical distributions corresponding to the above hamiltonian are : @xmath273 for model ( i ) , and @xmath274 for model ( ii ) , where @xmath275 represents the number of balls in the urn number @xmath58 .",
    "these distributions satisfy the detailed balance  ( [ bilan ] ) for the metropolis markov chain .",
    "first we treat the backgammon model which displays slow dynamics",
    ". the monkey model will be studied at the end of the section .",
    "we will prove below that the spectral gap of the backgammon model at @xmath264 decays exponentially with @xmath265 .",
    "by contrast , the monkey model is rapid : @xmath3 is polynomial in @xmath10 and @xmath265 . as a consequence",
    ", all the glassy character of the backgammon model comes from the distinguishable character of its particles .      to begin with",
    ", we study the case of @xmath266 urns , denoted by @xmath276 and @xmath277 . at this stage ,",
    "let us already discuss the important following point : at zero temperature , the fundamental state is twice degenerate : all the balls can be in @xmath276 ( state @xmath278 ) or in @xmath277 ( state @xmath279 ) .",
    "in other words , the eigenvalue 1 of @xmath2 is degenerate and at vanishingly small temperature , the spectral gap tends to 0 and the equilibriation time diverges .",
    "but what does this equilibriation time measure ?",
    "at very low temperature , the energy landscape is essentially a bistable potential with an energy barrier of height 1 .",
    "thus @xmath3 measures the time that the system needs to equilibriate between the two fundamental states @xmath278 and @xmath279 , in other words to explore the two potential minima with almost equal probabilities .",
    "naturally , this time diverges like @xmath280 .",
    "but we are not interested in such a time but rather in _ the typical time to reach one of the two minima _ , the `` absorption time '' in ref .  @xcite . in other words , at zero temperature , we consider that the system has reached equilibrium when one urn is empty ( and when all urns are empty save one if there are several urns ) . for a finite system , this time remains finite , even at @xmath281  @xcite .",
    "therefore we would like to design a new transition matrix @xmath83 , the spectral gap of which measures efficiently the previous time at @xmath281 .",
    "a solution consists in mixing up both stationary states as follows : when the system has reached one of the states @xmath278 or @xmath279 for the first time at @xmath282 , at each time @xmath283 , he can be flipped to state @xmath278 or @xmath279 with probability @xmath51 . in other words , we set @xmath284 . as a consequence , at time @xmath285 , the system can have explored the two potential minima with equal probabilities .",
    "the unique equilibrium distribution is now @xmath286 .",
    "and the spectral gap @xmath287 now measures the equilibriation time we are interested in .",
    "we denote by @xmath288 the previous matrix @xmath83 .",
    "it is a @xmath289 matrix , with elements proportional to the number of balls in the urn @xmath269 : @xmath290 we have not succeeded in diagonalizing this matrix .",
    "it is not specifically our purpose since we principally desire to exemplify how the multi - decomposition method relates @xmath10-urn problems to 2-urn ones .",
    "however high precision numerical diagonalization up to @xmath291 shows without ambiguity that @xmath292 when @xmath265 is large .",
    "this value seems to be asymptotically exact .",
    "we shall see in the following subsection that all the slow character of the backgammon model lies in this 2-urn exponentially small gap : adding more urns will only modify it by a polynomial factor .",
    "now we consider the case @xmath293 and we relate its dynamics to the previous one @xmath266 .",
    "we denote the urns by @xmath294 .",
    "we apply the same kind of trick as in the two - urn case to get rid of the degeneracy of the fundamental state : the @xmath10 lower energy states , were all urns are empty save one , are mixed up and form a single state . once all urns",
    "are empty save one , all the balls can be transferred to any urn @xmath295 with equal probability @xmath179 .",
    "this trick ensures that at @xmath281 the equilibrium state in non - degenerate and that the spectral gap of the new transition matrix measures the good equilibriation time , that is to say the typical time needed to empty all urns save one .",
    "the multi - decomposition is defined as follows : @xmath296 , @xmath12 , is the set of all configurations where the urn @xmath295 contains exactly @xmath297 balls . in this subset ,",
    "the number of balls of @xmath295 can not vary .",
    "the integer @xmath15 can take all the values ranging from 0 to @xmath265 .",

    "we work with the matrix @xmath216 of eq .",
    "( [ pihat ] ) .",
    "however , one must keep in mind that all the method relies on the scalar product  ( [ scalprod ] ) where @xmath81 can not vanish for any @xmath38 .",
    "therefore we must work at @xmath270 where @xmath301 and then take the limit @xmath264 in the gap relation  ( [ gaprel ] ) .",
    "we recall that the coefficients of @xmath216 are the conditional probabilities at equilibrium that @xmath295 contains @xmath15 balls given that @xmath302 contains @xmath218 balls .",
    "when @xmath264 , in regard to eq .",
    "( [ distrib.ii ] ) , the system condenses on its energy minimum _ inside _",
    "the energy is minimized when all the @xmath303 remaining balls are in the same urn .",
    "this minimum is @xmath183 times degenerate .",
    "therefore @xmath304 with probability @xmath305 and @xmath306 with probability @xmath307",
    ".    therefore the limiting matrix @xmath216 is a @xmath242 block - matrix like ( [ bblock ] ) where each block is now a @xmath308 matrix and @xmath309 the matrix @xmath157 can be diagonalized and its eigenvalues are 1 ( non - degenerate ) , @xmath305 and @xmath244 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors are @xmath310 ; the vectors @xmath311 , @xmath312 , and so forth ; the vectors @xmath313 , @xmath314 , and so forth .",
    "the exact number of vectors of the two last species depends on the parity of @xmath265 : if @xmath265 is even , one should add the vector @xmath315 , where the one is at the middle of the vector .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue is @xmath305 .",
    "then the same kind of calculation as in the previous example [ sm ] leads to the conclusion that the multi - decomposition is non - degenerate and that @xmath298 .    like in the previous example , this multi - decomposition is regular with redundancy @xmath258 since each transposition of indices @xmath14 and @xmath227 is forbidden in exactly two decompositions .",
    "since @xmath298 , theorem  [ th1 ] reads @xmath316 as compared to the previous examples , the situation is more complex here , because the matrix @xmath93 is _ not _ the direct sum of identical matrices . according to the number @xmath297 of balls that are stuck in the urn @xmath295 , the number of particles that are effectively involved in the dynamics on the subset @xmath13 varies .",
    "it is equal to @xmath317 .",

    "suppose it is true for @xmath183 .",
    "the matrix @xmath93 in ( [ gap_ii0 ] ) is the direct sum of @xmath320 matrices of backgammon models on @xmath183 urns with @xmath317 balls , @xmath321 .",

    "hence ( [ gap_ii ] ) is verified .",
    "this relation is of crucial importance in the understanding of the origin of glassy dynamics : all the slow character ( the exponential decay of the gap with @xmath265 ) originates from the @xmath266 case ; adding additional boxes only divides the gap by a polynomial factor ( see the discussion at the end of this subsection , and ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we have tested numerically this gap relation on small systems where the transition matrix can easily be fully diagonalized numerically , namely for all @xmath10 and @xmath265 such that @xmath326 as well as all @xmath327 for @xmath328 . in all cases ,",
    "the previous inequality turns out to be an equality .",
    "we are led to the following :    [ conjurns ] the inequality  ( [ gap_ii ] ) is in fact an equality : @xmath329    we shall return to this conjecture below .",

    "then on average , one tries one move per urn and per time unit and one expects that typical times will not depend on the system size at the large size limit ; we will see below that it is precisely what happens .",
    "spectral gaps must also be re - scaled to take this point into effect : @xmath331 .",

    "finally , we present partial results on a difficult problem from probability theory : the `` contingency table problem '' . in this case , we will not be able to calculate exactly the norm @xmath105 because the matrices @xmath162 or @xmath216 are not as regular as in the previous examples .",
    "however @xmath105 can be computed numerically for thousands of different examples because these matrices are sufficiently small .",

    "these tables are entirely characterized by one of their coefficients , say @xmath388 .",
    "this coefficients varies by @xmath389 at each step of the markov process .",

    "apart from this ( important ) difference , all the previous development can be applied to the present chain . in particular ,",
    "the multi - decomposition is adapted to @xmath398 .",
    "once again , one notices that the multi - decomposition technique does not depend on the details of the chain , provided the stationary distribution @xmath47 and the subsets @xmath13 are the same .",
    "however , after removing @xmath382 rows and @xmath383 columns , the `` ultimate '' markov chain of type @xmath398 on @xmath191 tables will differ from the @xmath353-type one .",

    "we use relation  ( [ epsvar ] ) to calculate an upper bound of mixing times @xmath76 for both markov chains .",
    "since @xmath47 is uniform , @xmath407 is constant and equal to @xmath408 , where @xmath409 denotes the cardinality of @xmath349 .",

    "let us mention the existence of generalizations in higher dimensions of the previous markov chains on contingency tables  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to test whether this technique can be applied to them .",
    "the multi - decomposition technique is a generalization of the `` chain decomposition method '' of d. randall which can be more easy to implement in certain cases . instead of a single decomposition ,",
    "the method uses several intricate ones .",

    ", a key quantity intervenes in this relation , which is calculated _ at equilibrium _ , whereas the spectral gap is a dynamical quantity .",
    "we have illustrated the potentialities of the multi - decomposition technique on several examples .",
    "the first examples ( random walkers and `` card shuffling '' ) are elementary , in that sense that their spectral gaps can be calculated by other means . however , they are a good illustration of the method efficiency . we have also exemplified in these examples that the same multi - decomposition can be applied to different dynamics on the same system .    the last examples are more interesting since they deal with complex markov chains of theoretical interest .",
    "the `` backgammon model '' and the `` monkey model '' belong to the wider class of `` urn models '' and are related to the physics of glassy systems .",
    "we have recovered in a rigorous way that the former is slow whereas the latter is rapid .",
    "this fundamental difference is only due to the fact that particles are distinguishable in the first model and indistinguishable in the second one .",
    "these two examples have also been the occasion to introduce temperature in the method .",
    "the `` contingency table problem '' is a notoriously difficult problem from probability theory .",
    "we have not been able to solve completely this problem .",
    "however , the computational advantage of the method is illuminating in this case : the matrix @xmath216 is much smaller than the original matrix @xmath2 and can be numerically diagonalized for much larger systems .",
    "these numerical calculations support a conjecture , the veracity of which would imply that the markov chains under interest are rapid . in this case",
    "also , the same multi - decomposition can be applied to two different dynamics .",
    "in addition , we have remarked that for the four first examples examined in this paper , the gap relation  ( [ gaprel ] ) of theorem  [ th1 ] turned out to be an equality , since we obtained the exact gaps at the end of the calculations .",
    "it is legitimate to wonder whether it is always true . indeed , even if the present version of the theorem is sufficient to establish that some markov chains are rapidly mixing , this would be a stronger result than theorem  [ th1 ] . to answer this question",
    ", we mention that we know an example on a 20-state markov chain where ( [ gaprel ] ) is only an inequality and not an equality .",
    "hence the question becomes : is it possible to establish a criterion to decide whether relation ( [ gaprel ] ) is an equality or not ?",
    "it is difficult to tackle this question in the frame of our calculations , because inequalities appear in the demonstration of theorem  [ th1 ] .",

    "<S> we propose an exact technique to calculate lower bounds of spectral gaps of discrete time reversible markov chains on finite state sets . </S>",
    "<S> spectral gaps are a common tool for evaluating convergence rates of markov chains . as an illustration </S>",
    "<S> , we successfully use this technique to evaluate the `` absorption time '' of the `` backgammon model '' , a paradigmatic model for glassy dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the application of this technique to the `` contingency table problem '' , a notoriously difficult problem from probability theory . </S>",
    "<S> the interest of this technique is that it connects spectral gaps , which are quantities related to dynamics , with static quantities , calculated at equilibrium .    </S>",
    "<S> preprint    * key - words : * markov chains   spectral gaps   rapid / slow dynamics   urn models  - contingency tables .    </S>",
    "<S> markov chains  @xcite have applications in many areas , ranging from pure probability theory to theoretical or numerical statistical physics . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in out - of - equilibrium statistical physics , they are commonly used to write in a formalized form the time evolution of physical models  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we study in this paper   as a particular application of our technique   the `` backgammon model ''  @xcite which is a well - known paradigmatic mean - field model for glassy dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> markov chains are also wide - spread in numerical statistical physics : monte carlo algorithms  @xcite with metropolis or glauber dynamics , which are examples of markov processes , are of great importance in the computational study of complex systems . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of such algorithms relies on their rates of convergence towards their equilibrium distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the ergodic times must be as short as possible to save computational time . </S>",
    "<S> usually , such algorithms are said to be _ rapid _ if their ergodic times are polynomial in the system sizes whereas ( generally speaking ) the numbers of configurations grow exponentially with system sizes . </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo algorithms are also more and more wide - spread in applied mathematics  ( see @xcite ) : the `` contingency table problem ''  @xcite that we examine at the end of the present paper will provide an example .    roughly speaking a markov @xmath0 process </S>",
    "<S> needs a characteristic time @xmath1 to be close to equilibrium ( the equilibriation time ) . if @xmath2 denotes the transition matrix ( defined below ) associated with @xmath0 , if @xmath3 is the spectral gap of @xmath2 , that is to say the difference between the two largest eigenvalues of @xmath2 , then @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we explain this point and we give references below . </S>",
    "<S> therefore if one calculates a lower bound on @xmath5 , one also gets an upper bound on @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , if @xmath3 is polynomial in the system size , then @xmath1 is also polynomial and the chain is rapid .    </S>",
    "<S> many efficient techniques have been developed to estimate ( or to bound ) mixing times and spectral gaps , when elementary techniques from linear algebra do not apply . among many others , </S>",
    "<S> we mention the `` coupling '' technique ( see @xcite ) , the `` canonical path '' and `` conductance '' arguments ( see  @xcite ) , or the `` chain decomposition '' method  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this last method relies on the following basic idea : ( i ) decompose the state space into disjoint smaller pieces ; ( ii ) prove that the dynamics is rapid on each piece considered in isolation ; ( iii ) re - compose the dynamics on the whole state space from that on pieces and prove it is rapid in its turn .    </S>",
    "<S> we insist on this method because our `` multi - decomposition '' technique is an extension of the previous one . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the idea of the chain decomposition method is schematically the following : suppose that the state space @xmath6 of the markov chain can be `` naturally '' decomposed into several disjoint subsets @xmath7 , @xmath8 ; then `` cut '' all the transitions between different subsets @xmath7 and only keep the transitions inside each subsets . the so - obtained restricted markov chain on each @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> suppose then that one can prove that each @xmath9 is rapid on @xmath7 , and that in addition the original dynamics is rapid `` between '' subsets . </S>",
    "<S> then , under certain conditions , the original dynamics on @xmath6 will also be rapid . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , even if one can easily prove that the dynamics is rapid on each @xmath7 , it can be extremely difficult or even impossible to handle the second step of the proof . in reference  @xcite , an idea which bypasses this difficulty was presented in the case of random rhombus tilings . </S>",
    "<S> in the present paper , we generalize this idea in a formalized form and we show that it has a much vaster domain of application than random tilings .    as compared to the previous `` simple '' decomposition method , the present `` multi - decomposition '' scheme uses several ( @xmath10 ) decompositions of @xmath6 , namely @xmath11 . for each decomposition indexed by @xmath12 , the set @xmath6 is also decomposed in disjoint subsets @xmath13 . as in the decomposition method , one first needs to prove that the dynamics is rapid in each subset @xmath13 , for each @xmath14 and each @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> . then if any two decompositions `` overlap sufficiently '' , in a sense that will be precised below , the dynamics will also be rapid on the whole set @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , given a decomposition @xmath16 , one does not have to prove any more that the original dynamics is rapid between subsets of this decomposition . </S>",
    "<S> this point is ensured instead by the remaining subsets @xmath17 , @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> these ideas are schematically exemplified in figure  [ decomps ] .       </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this delicate point with a simple example that will also be developed in greater detail below : consider a two - dimensional random walker on a square grid @xmath19 ( see figure  [ rw2d ] ) . at each step </S>",
    "<S> , the walker performs either a vertical or a horizontal move , with equal probability 1/4 in each direction ( we neglect the question of boundaries at this level of discussion ) . </S>",
    "<S> then in our formalism , we define two decompositions @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively a vertical and a horizontal one . in the vertical decomposition , each subset @xmath22 , @xmath23 , is a vertical segment , with no possible transitions towards the neighboring vertical segments : the horizontal edges are `` cut '' in this vertical decomposition . </S>",
    "<S> symmetrically , vertical edges are `` cut '' in the horizontal decomposition , and the subsets @xmath24 , @xmath25 are horizontal segments . </S>",
    "<S> now on each subset @xmath22 or @xmath24 , the induced dynamics on vertical or horizontal segments is nothing but that of a one - dimensional random walker which stays at the same place with probability 1/2 and moves in either direction with probability 1/4 . </S>",
    "<S> for such a random walker on segments of lengths @xmath26 , the spectral gaps are @xmath27 : the dynamics is rapid on each subset of each decomposition . </S>",
    "<S> then the method developed in this paper can be applied to this problem . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying idea is that any trajectory of the walkers is a succession of vertical and horizontal moves . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the dynamics on @xmath6 is a combination of the dynamics on the different subsets . </S>",
    "<S> if the dynamics is rapid on each subset , it will certainly be rapid on @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> more formally , one proves _ via _ the present technique that @xmath28 in other words , the dynamics on the whole set @xmath6 is faster than the dynamics on the slowest subset . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , this inequality can be checked by independent means and appears to be an equality . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> , we rigorously formalize these ideas in a more general point of view .       </S>",
    "<S> the interest of this method is that it can be applied inductively . </S>",
    "<S> this idea will be used throughout the paper . in the previous example </S>",
    "<S> , one can iterate the multi - decomposition scheme in the case of random walkers on larger and larger @xmath10-dimensional hyper - cubic grids of side lengths @xmath29 . at each stage @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> , there are @xmath10 decompositions , one for each dimension of space , and the subsets are @xmath30-dimensional hyper - cubic grids in their turn ( see figure  [ walker3d ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> then one proves by induction on @xmath10 that @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the transition matrix of a @xmath33-dimensional random walker . once again , this lower bound is in fact exact .    </S>",
    "<S> the organization of this paper is as follows : the first section introduces the background definitions and notations used throughout the paper . in particular , the notion of discrete time reversible markov chain on a finite state set is briefly recalled . </S>",
    "<S> the second section presents the specific definitions and the main results of the paper , which are applied to several pedagogical elementary examples in section 3 , namely random walkers on hyper - cubic lattices and on the symmetric group @xmath34 .    in section  [ urn ] </S>",
    "<S> , we successfully apply the present technique to two `` urn models '' , the `` backgammon model '' and the `` monkey urn model '' . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> we relate the dynamics on @xmath10 urns to the dynamics on 2 urns . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the source of the slow dynamics of the backgammon model is entirely contained in the 2-urn problem . in other words , considering many urns instead of 2 does not bring any additional slowness  @xcite . at last , </S>",
    "<S> the contingency table problem is analyzed in section  [ ctp ] . </S>",
    "<S> the last section  [ discussion ] is devoted to conclusions . </S>"
