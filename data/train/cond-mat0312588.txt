    "the thermopower tensor is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the conductivity and peltier ( thermoelectric ) conductivity tensors , respectively .",
    "the relation @xmath10 generally holds only when the system has isotropic transport tensors ( e.g. , @xmath11 ) . in this case , the nernst signal is given by @xmath12 here , we follow the sign convention such that the nernst signal arising from vortex flow in a superconductor is positive .",
    "we will be mainly concerned with situations where @xmath13 over a wide range of fields , and therefore concentrate on the calculation of the nernst coefficient @xmath14 .",

    "the nernst coefficient is thus encoded in the dependence of @xmath22 on @xmath18 .",
    "we proceed by assuming a constant scattering time @xmath23 , in order to focus on the role of fermi surface geometry in the nernst effect , returning to the details of @xmath23 below . in two dimensions and to linear order in magnetic field the longitudinal and hall conductivities are expressed in terms of integrals over the fermi surface , @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the velocity of the quasiparticle ( and spin and band indices are suppressed ) .",

    "the reduction factor involving the lattice spacing [ @xmath29 and the magnetic length [ @xmath30 encodes the field s weakness on a scale natural to the system .",
    "this is multiplied ( apart from the numerical factor ) by the ratio of the thermal energy and relaxation rate , and by the dimensionless derivative @xmath31 .",

    "finally , it is important to note that when @xmath37 the nernst coefficient is negative .     the energy scale @xmath32 ( hall angle in appropriate units )",

    "remarkably , this crude estimate is exceedingly accurate ( see fig .  [",

    "@xcite with @xmath52 , the estimate for the nernst coefficient then boils down to @xmath53 where the last expression is evaluated using @xmath54 .",
    "remarkably , this estimate is applicable even in the limit where the effective band dispersion is essentially that of free particles ( e.g. , for @xmath55 in fig .",

    "the results for the conductivities ( inset of fig .",

    "equation  ( [ eq:1nu - estimate ] ) suggests that quasiparticles will generally make a finite , typically negative contribution to the nernst coefficient .",
    "the magnitude of the effect is controlled by the product @xmath56 .",
    "this can be small , e.g. , when the scattering is strong or at low temperatures in the impurity dominated regime , or large , e.g.  in clean systems with only moderate inelastic scattering . in this latter regime",
    "the boltzmann theory predicts that the range of magnetic fields over which @xmath15 is linear diminishes , with the crossover to @xmath57 taking place at @xmath58 .",
    "although in practice this crossover between weak - field and large - field regimes need not be sharp ( or simple ) , in cases where such behavior in @xmath59 can be observed as the temperature is lowered , it can serve as an independent evidence of coherent quasiparticle transport.@xcite    up to now our discussion explicitly assumed that all relaxation processes can be summarized by a single scattering time , independent of the energy or momentum of the quasiparticles .",
    "this simplified analysis can be readily generalized to three dimensions [ the factor of @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1mmw ] ) becomes @xmath61 .",
    "the analysis in the next section proceeds along these lines and focuses on the contribution to the effect coming from the ddw induced changes in fermi surface , which is very much in the spirit of the proposal of refs .  .",
    "we believe , however , that a more detailed modelling of relaxation may be necessary , both in htsc and other cases .",
    "for example , we have completely neglected issues such as the dependence of the scattering time on energy or location on the fermi surface , as well as the difference in the relaxation of electrical and energy currents  @xcite ( which may lead to different scattering times , as may be the case for scattering by phonons ) .",
    "clearly , these issues can not be addressed without a specific material in mind .",
    "we defer our discussion of particular experiments until sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] . here , we focus on the energy dependence of the scattering time , for which a general statement is possible .",

    "[ fig : whole - band ] ) .",
    "one may then estimate @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the density of states at the fermi surface .",
    "if the scattering is primarily due to weak quenched disorder ( or phonons above the debye temperature ) the corresponding rate is approximated by @xmath65 .",
    "then , properly accounting for the @xmath18 dependence of @xmath23 amounts to an additional factor of 2 in the estimate of the nernst coefficient .",
    "@xcite more generally , even for inelastic processes , one expects the scattering rate to be an increasing function of the electronic density of states , and therefore act to enhance the estimate in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1nu - estimate ] ) .",
    "the ddw state is specified by the following hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the creation operator for a quasiparticle with momentum @xmath68 and spin @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is the effective quasiparticle dispersion .",

    "this choice of parameters is consistent with the character of the fermi surface observed in arpes  @xcite in the doping range of @xmath92 .",
    "the choice of @xmath93 requires some care as the effect of ddw order is sensitive to the filling . for clarity we loosely classify the different regimes as `` weak '' , `` moderate'',``ambipolar '' , and `` dirac '' .",

    "its spectrum consists of dirac points at @xmath94 .",
    "the ambipolar regime can occur at moderately strong @xmath93 , in the vicinity of half filling . here",
    "the fermi surface consists of three well formed sheets , two hole - like centered about @xmath95 and one electron - like centered about @xmath96 , and the system is thus composed of two types of carriers .",
    "we discuss these two regime in the appendix , as we do not believe either of them is realized in the doping range where enhanced nernst effect is observed .",
    "the fermi surfaces of both of these states are sufficiently remarkable to be easily ruled out based on the available arpes data .",
    "@xcite experimentally , neither well defined electron pockets in the antinodal direction nor dirac nodes ( with the fermi energy essentially at the node ) are of relevance to the normal state of hole - doped cuprates .    in their stead , in this section , we present results for ddw order in the weak ( high temperature ) and moderate ( low temperature ) regimes ( for which we use , as representative values , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively ) .",
    "qualitatively , the former regime is where ddw order just begins to set in by disconnecting the fermi surface into two hole pockets [ closed about @xmath99 and one electron pocket [ closed about @xmath96 ] .",
    "given the rather short scattering times at these elevated temperatures it is not clear whether such minute changes in the fermi surface geometry can be discerned ( and motivated ) from arpes .",
    "however , this regime is virtually unavoidable as one begins one s descent into the pseudogap .",
    "it is worth remarking that since the electron - like pocket is only such in its topology ( and name ) , e.g. its contribution to @xmath41 is hole - like , the effect of the ddw order is expected to be rather insignificant . at larger values of @xmath93 and away from half filling , the regime with moderate ddw order is intended as a caricature of the pseudogap at low temperatures , near the superconducting @xmath3 . here",
    "the electron pocket is absent and only two hole pockets ( `` arcs ''  @xcite ) remain .",
    "perhaps this is the regime of most interest , as the behavior in this regime provides much of the motivation for introducing ddw order to explain the pseudogap in the first place .",

    "( [ eq:1simplenu ] ) . even for the moderate regime , @xmath106 , the result for @xmath107 [ panel ( d ) ] shows that the overall enhancement in magnitude of the nernst coefficient is at most by a factor of 3 .",
    "moreover , the sign of the nernst signal ( which is opposite to the sign of @xmath107 ) remains negative .",
    "these are the central results of this section , and are important for the comparison with experiment in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "two other points are perhaps worth noting in these results .",
    "first , as anticipated , the effect of a weak ddw is very small ( solid _ vs. _ dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : transport ] ) .",
    "second , we note that for moderate ddw @xmath40 is decreasing as @xmath18 is increasing , and that this is the main source of the enhanced @xmath109 .",
    "this is the beginning of the trend which becomes especially pronounced in the dirac regime of the model ( see appendix ) .",
    "we are now in a position to compare transport properties of the ddw scenario with experimental data , obtained from different underdoped htsc .",
    "@xcite consider first the high temperature regime , where the observed effect is small , with a magnitude of about @xmath110nv / k@xmath111 t , usually negative , roughly independent of temperature , and linear in the applied magnetic fields over a very wide range .",
    "these experimental findings are consistent with our discussion of sec .",
    "[ sec:1theory ] ( i.e. , without ddw ) , where we argued for a generically negative sign of the effect . to fit the actual magnitude of the effect with our calculations",
    "requires taking @xmath112 , which is probably somewhat small for the cuprates .",
    "additional factors which may affect the nernst signal and were not taken into account may include the short scattering time of quasiparticles in the antinodal region and a dependence of the scattering time on energy ( see below ) . a separate measurement of the contribution of the two terms in eq .  ( [ eq:1q_xy ] )",
    "@xcite reveals a significant sondheimer cancellation in some cases ( in itself suggestive of the quasiparticle origin of the signal ) , but not in others , indicating that these additional factors may be more material dependent .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , below an onset temperature which is well separated from the superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 , the nernst coefficient begins to increase .",
    "the signal becomes large and positive , reaching a value of about @xmath113v / k@xmath111 t near @xmath3 ( depending on material , the increase in magnitude is typically by a factor of 50100 ) .",
    "there is no sondheimer cancellation in this case , as all of the increase arises from the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1q_xy ] ) , while the second goes down to zero .",
    "deviations from linearity in the magnetic field dependence are observed at moderate fields in some samples .",
    "below @xmath3 the line - shapes are no longer linear at small fields as one enters the flux flow regime .",
    "@xcite    the question is then whether the enhancement of the nernst signal above @xmath3 can be ascribed to ddw order .",
    "the results of sec .",
    "[ sec : ddw ] make such prospect unlikely .",
    "first , the nernst coefficient we find when the ddw order is introduced remains _ negative _ , opposite in sign to the effect in experiment .",
    "second , the enhancement in its magnitude due to modifications of the fermi surface by the ddw potential is rather modest , a factor of three at most .",
    "the nernst effect in the ddw phase is therefore not fundamentally different than what is expected from general notions of quasiparticle transport . given that @xmath114 does not change appreciably in the relevant temperature regime ( see below ) the overall magnitude of the predicted signal is significantly smaller than @xmath113v / k@xmath111 t .    at this point",
    "it is important to consider whether this conclusion may be modified by changing any of the underlying assumptions .",
    "we have investigated to some extent the dependence on different choices of effective band parameters ( beyond those reported in this paper ) , with no change to our conclusions .",
    "in addition to band structure , it is important to consider the role of scattering .",
    "indeed , the magnitude of the nernst signal depends on @xmath114 .",
    "this quantity may increase by a factor of 3 in the pseudogap regime as inferred from hall data  @xcite ( it is independent of temperature according to the conductivity data@xcite ) .",
    "we note that even if the scattering time increases dramatically when the temperature is lowered , the magnitude of the nernst signal will increase , but the sign will not change .",
    "another assumption we have made is to ignore the contribution arising from the scattering time s dependence on energy .",
    "this contribution may be of either sign , and , in particular , if @xmath115 there is an additional contribution to the nernst signal which is of positive sign .",
    "can this contribution be so strong so as to overwhelm the band structure contribution and lead to a large positive signal ? while unlikely , we note that this assumption leads to other discrepancies with the data .",
    "in particular , this would require a large contribution to the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1q_xy ] ) ( equal to one half of the contribution to the first term ) .",

    "( [ eq:1nu - estimate ] ) , suggests that the nernst effect due to quasiparticles may be quite large if @xmath116 .",
    "why is it , then , that large nernst coefficients are not typically observed in conventional metals , where @xmath117 is expected to grow as the system becomes more coherent , its magnitude limited only by the sample s purity ?",
    "much of the data in metals@xcite is collected in the temperature regime dominated by classical phonons . here",
    ", the resistivity varies linearly with temperature , while the nernst signal does not show a strong dependence on temperature ( with a few notable exceptions , e.g. , ni ) .",

    "have different relaxation rates ( as deduced from electrical and thermal conductivities ) , leading to a violation of the wiedemann - franz law .",
    "@xcite this difference might lead to a large conductivity in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1q_xy ] ) , and hence a suppression of the nernst signal .    following the discovery in the hole - doped cuprates ,",
    "relatively large nernst signals have been documented in other strongly correlated materials .",
    "@xcite perhaps the most obvious difference between these and conventional materials , as far as the nernst effect is concerned , is in the strong temperature dependence of the observed signal .",
    "since in at least some of these materials the transport is apparently due to quasiparticles , it is of interest to consider the corresponding nernst measurements in the light of our results . while far from a complete theory the discussion of sec .",
    "[ sec:1theory ] does allow for a few general observations .    in nbse@xmath1",

    "the nernst coefficient reaches a maximum , @xmath124v / k@xmath111 t , at @xmath125k , roughly the same temperature at which the hall number passes through zero .",
    "the behavior of the hall number is apparently sensitive to the charge density wave induced reconstruction of the fermi surface , which occurs below @xmath126k . as recognized by the authors of ref .",
    ", @xmath127 suggests an ambipolar origin of the signal due to bands of oppositely charged carriers , reminiscent of that encountered in semiconductors .",
    "@xcite we note , however , that a simple ambipolar picture leads to a positive nernst signal ( see appendix ) , opposite to the experimentally observed signal .",
    "it is also interesting to note that while the hall number remains essentially constant for @xmath128 the nernst coefficient grows appreciably ( up to 75 percent of its max value ) .",
    "this suggests to us that the enhanced nernst coefficient here owes its existence as much ( if not more ) to enhanced coherence in the system as to an ambipolar compensation .",
    "alternately , perhaps , the nernst measurement is sensitive to incipient cdw order , more so than @xmath129.@xcite    yet a larger nernst signal was reported very recently in the normal state of cecoin@xmath2 , a heavy fermion compound.@xcite here , the nernst signal is also negative and can be as high as @xmath130v / k@xmath111 t at low temperatures , suggestive of a highly coherent state ( large @xmath23 ) . as discussed in sec .",

    "theories implementing this intuitive picture are necessarily subtle and complex ( and rarely applicable directly to experiments ) .",
    "the ddw proposal is a breath of fresh air in that regard , here the pseudogap phase is a true phase of matter where the standard crisp notions of order parameter and quasiparticles apply and can be used to make predictive statements . in particular , most of the effects of ddw order discussed to date can be linked directly to the changes of the fermi surface geometry due to the breaking of the translational symmetry .",
    "implications of such fermi surface reconstruction for thermodynamic and dynamic properties of the system ( including transport ) were addressed in the past ( see , e.g. ref  ) and found consistent with the observed phenomenology .    in this work",

    "@xcite the nernst coefficient has a contribution originating from the changes of the fermi surface shape , which we compute explicitly , and one from the changes in the scattering rate ( treated as a phenomenological input ) .",
    "the first contribution alone predicts a negative nernst coefficient , which is in contradiction with the experiment .",
    "it is possible that upon inclusion of the second term the overall sign can be reversed , however , we presented arguments for why the overall magnitude can not approach the experimentally observed signal .",
