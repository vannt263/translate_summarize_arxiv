    "a vast body of data has already been collected and analyzed during past few years at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite toward a complete understanding of the dense qcd matter which is created in high energy heavy - ion collisions .    at collider experiments , it is well known that high @xmath1 perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) processes become so large as to observe jet spectra .",
    "one of the most important new physics revealed in heavy ion collisions at rhic energies is to study propagation of ( mini-)jets in dense qcd matter .",
    "jet quenching has been proposed  @xcite as a possible signal of deconfined nuclear matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . over the past years , a lot of work has been devoted to study the propagation of jets through qcd matter @xcite .",
    "recent data at rhic indicate that both the neutral pion  @xcite and the charged hadron  @xcite spectra at high @xmath1 in central au+au collisions are suppressed relative to the scaled @xmath5 or large centrality spectra by the number of binary collisions .",
    "however , protons do not seem to be quenched in the moderate @xmath1 range @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the proton yield exceeds the pion yield around @xmath6 - 3 gev/@xmath7 which is not seen in elementary hadronic collisions  @xcite .",
    "the star collaboration also shows that @xmath8 at a transverse momentum of 2 - 3 gev/@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "pqcd calculations are successful in describing hadron spectra in au+au collisions as well as @xmath5 collisions by taking account of nuclear effects such as cronin effect , nuclear shadowing effect , and energy loss of jets  @xcite .",
    "however , large uncertainly of the proton fragmentation function makes the understanding of the baryon production mechanism unclear  @xcite even in @xmath5 collisions . on the other hand ,",
    "several models have been proposed by considering interplay between non - perturbative soft physics and pqcd hard physics : baryon junction  @xcite , parton coalescence  @xcite , medium modification of the string fragmentation  @xcite , and a parametrization with hydrodynamic component combined with the non - thermal components  @xcite in order to explain the anomalous baryon productions and/or large elliptic flow discovered at rhic .",
    "it is said that hydrodynamics  @xcite works very well for explanation of elliptic flow data at rhic energies , in the low @xmath1 region , in small centrality events , and at midrapidity , including the mass dependence of hadrons ( for recent reviews , see ref .",
    "this suggests that hydrodynamics could be reliable for the description of the time evolution of soft sector of matter produced in high energy heavy ion collisions at rhic .",
    "certainly , it is more desirable to describe the time evolution of the whole stage in high energy heavy ion collisions by simulating collisions of initial nuclear wave functions .",
    "instead , they simply assume that the system created in heavy ion collisions reaches local thermal equilibrium state at some time .    due to the above two reasons , a model which treats a soft sector by hydrodynamics and a hard sector based on a pqcd parton model",
    "is turned out to be useful in order to understand experimental data at rhic _ from low to high _ @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , first attempts based on this concept has been done by pqcd calculations which include hydrodynamic features  @xcite .",
    "motivated by these works , we have recently developed a two component _ dynamical _ model ( hydro+jet model )  @xcite with a fully three dimensional hydrodynamic model  @xcite for the soft sector and pqcd jets for the hard sector which are computed via the pythia code  @xcite .",
    "usually , it is possible to fit hadron spectra up to high momentum , say @xmath9 2 - 3 gev/@xmath7 , within hydrodynamics by adjusting kinetic freeze - out temperature @xmath10 which is a free parameter in the model @xcite .",
    "thus it is unclear which value of @xmath10 should be used when one wants to add jet components into hydrodynamic components for the description of high @xmath1 part .",
    "however , we are free from this problem thanks to inclusion of the early chemical freeze - out picture into hydrodynamics .",
    "one of the authors studied the effects of chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath11 which is separate from kinetic one @xmath10 in hydrodynamic model in ref .",
    "it was found that the @xmath1 slope for pions remains invariant under the variation of @xmath10 and that the hydrodynamic model with early chemical freeze out is able to fit the transverse momentum distribution of pions up to 1 - 2 gev/@xmath7 .",
    "therefore , it is certain to incorporate hard partons into the hydrodynamics with early freeze out in order to account for the high transverse momentum part of the hadronic spectrum .",
    "we note that , since we do not assume thermalization for the high @xmath1 jets , a hydrodynamical calculation with the initial conditions taken from pqcd+final state saturation model @xcite is different from ours .    in this paper , we shall study identified hadron spectra from low to high @xmath1 within the hydro+jet model .",
    "in particular , we focus on the influence of the hydrodynamic radial flow on the pqcd predictions for the transverse spectra",
    ". parameters in the hydrodynamic part of the model have been already fixed by fitting the pseudorapidity distribution .",
    "parameters related to the propagation of partons are also obtained by fitting the neutral pion suppression factor by phenix and are found to be consistent  @xcite with the back - to - back correlation data from star  @xcite .",

    "it should be emphasized that the slope of pions in the transverse momentum distribution becomes insensitive to the choice of the kinetic freeze - out temperature @xmath10 and that the hydrodynamics with early chemical freeze out reproduces the rhic data of the pion transverse momentum only up to 1.5 gev/@xmath7  @xcite .",
