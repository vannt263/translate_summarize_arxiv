    "community detection is the partitioning of a set of nodes  @xmath1 into non - overlapping   and non - empty subsets @xmath2 , called communities , that together cover @xmath1 .",
    "there is usually no agreed upon optimal partitioning of nodes into communities .",
    "instead there is an array of approaches that differ in both the definition of optimality and the method used to achieve , exactly or approximately , this optimality ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) . in classical networks",
    "optimality is , for example , defined statistically  @xcite , e.g.  in terms of connectivity  @xcite or communicability  @xcite , or increasingly , and sometimes relatedly  @xcite , in terms of stochastic random walks  @xcite .",
    "our particular focus is on the latter , since the concept of transport ( e.g.  a quantum walk ) is central to nearly all studies conducted in quantum physics . as for achieving optimality ,",
    "methods include direct maximization via simulated annealing  @xcite or , usually faster , iterative division or agglomeration of communities  @xcite .",
    "we focus on the latter since it provides a simple and effective way of revealing a full hierarchical structure of the network , requiring only the definition of the closeness of a pair of communities .",
    "formally , hierarchical community structure detection methods are based on a ( symmetric ) closeness function @xmath3 of two communities @xmath4 . in the agglomerative approach , at the lowest level of the hierarchy , the nodes",
    "are each assigned their own communities .",
    "an iterative procedure then follows , in each step of which the closest pair of communities ( maximum closeness @xmath5 ) are merged .",
    "this procedure ends at the highest level , where all nodes are in the same community . to avoid instabilities in this agglomerative procedure",
    ", the closeness function is required to be non - increasing under the merging of two communities , @xmath6 , which allows the representation of the community structure as a linear hierarchy indexed by the merging closeness .",
    "the resulting structure is often represented as a dendrogram ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dendro ] )  .",
    "this leaves open the question of which level of the hierarchy yields the optimal community partitioning .",
    "if a partitioning is desired for simulation , for example , then there may be a desired maximum size or minimum number of communities .",
    "however , without such constraints , one can still ask what is the best choice of communities within those given by the hierarchical structure .    a type of measure that is often used to quantify the quality of a community partitioning choice for this purpose is modularity  @xcite , denoted @xmath7 .",
    "it was originally introduced in the classical network setting , in which a network is specified by a ( symmetric ) adjacency matrix of ( non - negative ) elements @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , each off - diagonal element giving the weight of connections between nodes @xmath10 and @xmath11  .",
    "the modularity attempts to measure the fraction of weights connecting elements in the same community , relative to what might be expected .",
    "specifically , one takes the fraction of intra - community weights and subtracts the average fraction obtained when the start and end points of the connections are reassigned randomly , subject to the constraint that the total connectivity @xmath12 of each node is fixed .",
    "the modularity is then given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total weight of connections , @xmath15 is the modularity matrix with elements @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the community matrix , with elements @xmath18 equal to unity if @xmath19 , otherwise zero .",
    "the modularity then takes values strictly less than one , possibly negative , and exactly zero in the case that the nodes form a single community .",
    "as we will see , there is no natural adjacency matrix associated with the quantum network and so for the purposes of modularity we use @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "the modularity @xmath7 thus measures the fraction of the closeness that is intra - community , relative to what would occur if the inter - node closeness @xmath22 were randomly mixed while fixing the total closeness @xmath23 of each node to all others .",
    "thus both the community structure and optimum partitioning depend solely on the choice of the closeness function .",
    "modularity - based methods such as above are intuitive , fast and on the most part effective , yet we must note that for classical systems it has been shown that modularity - based methods suffer from a number of flaws that influence the overall efficacy of those approaches . in refs .",
    "@xcite modularity - based methods show a poor performance in large , sparse real - world and model networks .",
    "this is due mainly to the resolution limit problem  @xcite , where small communities can be overlooked , and modularity landscape degeneracy , which strongly influence accuracy in large networks .",
    "another modularity - related problem is the so - called detectability / undetectability threshold  @xcite where an approximate bi - partition of the system becomes undetectable in some cases , in particular in presence of degree homogeneity .",
    "however , in the present work we focus on quantum networks whose size typically remains small compared to classical targets of community detection algorithms , and for which the derived adjacency matrices are not sparse .",
    "these characteristics help to limit the known flaws of our modularity - based approach , making it adequate for our purposes .",
    "finally , once a community partitioning is obtained it is often desired to compare it against another .",
    "here we use the common normalized mutual information ( nmi )  @xcite as a measure of the mutual dependence of two community partitionings . each partitioning @xmath24",
    "is represented by a probability distribution @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the number of nodes in community  @xmath27 .",
    "the similarity of two community partitionings @xmath28 and @xmath29 depends on the joint distribution @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number of nodes that belong to both communities @xmath27 and @xmath32 .",
    "specifically , nmi is defined as @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the shannon entropy of @xmath35 , and the mutual information @xmath36 depends on the entropy @xmath37 of the joint distribution @xmath38 .",
    "the mutual information is the average of the amount of information about the community of a node in @xmath28 obtained by learning its community in @xmath29 .",
    "the normalization ensures that the nmi has a minimum value of zero and takes its maximum value of unity for two identical community partitionings .",
    "the symmetry of the definition of nmi follows from that of mutual information and eq .  .",
    "the task of community detection has a particular interpretation in a quantum setting .",
    "the state of a quantum system is described in terms of a hilbert space @xmath39 , spanned by a complete orthonormal set of basis states @xmath40 .",
    "each basis state  @xmath41 can be associated with a node  @xmath10 in a network and often , as in the case of single exciton transport , there is a clear choice of basis states that makes this abstraction to a spatially distributed network natural .",
    "the partitioning of nodes into communities then corresponds to the partitioning of the hilbert space @xmath42 into mutually orthogonal subspaces @xmath43 . as with classical networks",
    ", one can then imagine an assortment of optimality objectives for community detection , for example , to identify a partitioning into subspaces in which inter - subspace transport is small , or in which the state of the system remains relatively unchanged within each subspace .",
    "in the next two subsections we introduce two classes of community closeness measures that correspond to these objectives .",
    "technical details can be found in the supplemental material .    in what follows ,",
    "we focus our analysis one an isolated quantum system governed by hamiltonian  @xmath44 , which enables us to derive convenient closed - form expressions for the closeness measures .",
    "we may expand  @xmath44 in the node basis @xmath40 : @xmath45 a diagonal element @xmath46 is a real value denoting the energy of state @xmath41 , whilst an off - diagonal element @xmath47 , @xmath21 , is a complex weight denoting the change in the amplitude of the wave function during a transition from state @xmath48 to @xmath41 .",
    "the matrix formed by these elements can be thought of as a @xmath49 complex , hermitian adjacency matrix . in quantum mechanics , complex elements in the hamiltonian lead to a range of phenomena not captured by real matrices , such as time - reversal symmetry breaking  @xcite . in the case where each state  @xmath41 corresponds to a particle being localised at a spatially distinct node  @xmath10",
    ", the hamiltonian describes a spinless single - particle walk with an energy landcape given by the diagonal elements , and transition amplitudes by the off - diagonal elements .",
    "any quantum evolution can be viewed in this picture , making the single particle spiness walk scenario rather general .",
    "a community partitioning based on a hamiltonian @xmath44 could be used , among other things , to guide the simulation or analysis of a more complete model in the presence of an environment , where this more complete model may be much more difficult to describe .",
    "additionally , our method could be generalized to use closeness measures based on open - system dynamics obtained numerically .",
    "several approaches to detecting communities in classical networks are based on the flow of probability through the network during a classical random walk  @xcite . in particular , many of these methods seek communities for which the inter - community probability flow or transport is small . a natural approach to quantum community detection",
    "is thus to consider the flow of probability during a continuous - time quantum walk , and to investigate the _ change _ in the probability of observing the walker within each community : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the state of the walker , at time  @xmath52 , during the walk generated by @xmath44 , and @xmath53 is the probability of a walker in state  @xmath54 being found in community  @xmath27 upon a von neumann - type measurement   is the norm of the projection ( performed by projector @xmath55 ) of the state @xmath54 onto the community subspace @xmath56 . ] .",
    "@xmath57 denotes the projector to the @xmath27 subspace .",
    "the initial state  @xmath58 can be chosen freely .",
    "the change in inter - community transport is clearest when the process begins either entirely inside or entirely outside each community .",
    "because of this , we choose the walker to be initially localized at a single node @xmath59 and then , for symmetry , sum @xmath60 over all @xmath61 .",
    "this results in the particularly simple expression @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the doubly stochastic transfer matrix whose elements @xmath64 give the probability of transport from node  @xmath65 to node  @xmath10 , and @xmath66 its symmetrization .",
    "this is reminiscent of classical community detection methods , e.g.  @xcite , using closeness measures based on the transfer matrix of a classical random walk .",
    "we can thus build a community structure that seeks to reduce @xmath60 at each hierarchical level by using the closeness function @xmath67 where the numerator is the decrement in @xmath60 caused by merging communities @xmath27 and @xmath68 .",
    "the normalizing factor in eq .",
    "avoids the effects due to the uninteresting scaling of the numerator with the community size .    since a quantum walk",
    "does not converge to a stationary state , a time - average of the closeness defined in eq .",
    "is needed to obtain a quantity that eventually converges with increasing time . given the linearity of the formulation , this corresponds to replacing the transport probability  @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : closeness_transport ] ) with its time - average @xmath70    it follows that , as with similar classical community detection methods  @xcite , our method is in fact a class of approaches , each corresponding to a different time @xmath52 .",
    "the appropriate value of @xmath52 will depend on the specific application , for example , a natural time - scale might be the decoherence time . not wishing to lose generality and focus on a particular system , we focus here on the short and long time limits .",
    "in the short time limit @xmath71 , relevant if @xmath72 for @xmath21 , the averaged transfer matrix @xmath73 is simply proportional to @xmath74 .",
    "note that in the short time limit there is no interference between different paths from @xmath41 to @xmath48 , and therefore for short times @xmath75 does not depend on the on - site energies @xmath46 or the phases of the hopping elements @xmath76 .",
    "this is because , to leading order in time , interference does not play a role in the transport out of a single node .",
    "for this reason we can refer to this approach as `` semi - classical '' .    in the long time limit @xmath77 ,",
    "relevant if @xmath52 is much larger than the inverse of the smallest gap between distinct eigenvalues of @xmath44 , the probabilities are elements of the mixing matrix  @xcite , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the projector onto the @xmath80-th eigenspace of @xmath44 .",
    "this thus provides a simple spectral method for building the community structure .",
    "note that , unlike in a classical infinitesimal stochastic walk where each @xmath81 eventually becomes proportional to the connectivity @xmath82 of the final node @xmath65 , the long time limit in the quantum setting is non - trivial and , as we will see , @xmath83 retains a strong impression of the community structure for large  @xmath52  , there is no guarantee of symmetry @xmath84 in the transfer matrix for a given hamiltonian .",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "hamiltonians featuring this symmetry , e.g. , those with real @xmath47 , are called time - symmetric . ] .",
    "classical walks , and the community detection methods based on them , are fully described by the evolution of the probabilities of the walker occupying each node .",
    "the previous quantum community detection approach is based on the evolution of the same probabilities but for a quantum walker",
    ". however , quantum walks are richer than this , they are not fully described by the evolution of the node - occupation probabilities .",
    "we therefore introduce another community detection method that captures the full quantum dynamics within each community subspace .    instead of reducing merely the change in probability within the community subspaces , we reduce the change in the projection of the quantum state in the community subspaces .",
    "this change is measured using ( squared ) fidelity , a common measure of distance between two quantum states . for a walk beginning in state @xmath58",
    "we therefore focus on the quantity @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the projection of the state @xmath54 onto the subspace @xmath56 and @xmath87\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the fidelity , which is symmetric between @xmath54 and @xmath88 .",
    "we build a community structure that seeks to maximize the increase in @xmath89 at each hierarchical level by using the closeness measure @xmath90,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e.  the change in @xmath89 caused by merging communities @xmath27 and  @xmath68 .",
    "our choice for the denominator prevents uninteresting size scaling , as in eq .  .",
    "the initial state  @xmath91 can be chosen freely . here",
    "we choose the pure uniform superposition state @xmath92 satisfying @xmath93 for all  @xmath10 .",
    "this state was used to investigate the effects of the connectivity on the dynamics of a quantum walker in  ref .",
    "@xcite .    as for our other community detection approach ,",
    "we consider the time - average of eq .  , which yields @xmath94 where @xmath95 .",
    "in the long time limit , the time - average of the density matrix takes a particularly simple expression : @xmath96 where @xmath79 is as in the previous sec .",
    "[ sec : mixing ] .    the definition of community closeness given in eq .",
    "can exhibit negative values . in this case",
    "the usual definition of modularity fails  @xcite and one must extended it . in this work we use the definition of modularity proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which coincides with eq .",
    "( [ eq : modularity ] ) in the case of non - negative closeness .",
    "the extended definition treats negative and positive links separately , and tries to minimize intra - community negative links while maximizing intra - community positive links .",
    "to analyze the performance of our quantum community detection methods we apply them to three different networks .",
    "the first one ( sec .",
    "[ sec : quantumnet ] ) is a simple quantum network , which we use to highlight how some intuitive notions in classical community detection do not necessarily transfer over to quantum systems .",
    "the second example ( sec .  [ sec : artificial ] ) is an artificial quantum network designed to exhibit a clear classical community structure , which we show is different from the quantum community structure obtained and fails to capture significant changes in this structure induced by quantum mechanical phases on the hopping elements of the hamiltonian . the final network ( sec .",
    "[ sec : lhcii ] ) is a real world quantum biological network , describing the lhcii light harvesting complex , for which we find a consistent quantum community structure differing from the community structure cited in the literature .",
    "these findings confirm that a quantum mechanical treatment of community detection is necessary as classical and semi - classical methods can not be reproduce the structures that appropriately capture quantum effects .    below we will compare quantum community structures against more classical community structures , such the one given by the semi - classical method based on the short time transport and , in the case of the example of sec .",
    "[ sec : artificial ] , the classical network from which the quantum network is constructed .",
    "additionally we use a traditional classical community detection algorithm , oslom  @xcite , an algorithm based on the maximization of the statistical significance of the proposed partitioning , whose input adjacency matrix  @xmath97 must be real . for this purpose",
    "we use the absolute values of the hamiltonian elements in the site basis : @xmath98 .      .",
    "for dashed and dotted lines the transition amplitude can be either zero ( a , b and c ) or the absolute value is the same @xmath99 but phase is ( d and g ) coherent ( all ones ) , ( e and h ) random @xmath100 for each link , ( f and i ) canceling ( ones for dashed red and minus one for dotted green ) .",
    "plots show the node closeness for both methods based on transport and fidelity ( only the long - time - averages are considered , in plots ( g ) , ( h ) and ( i ) we used a perturbed hamiltonian to solve the eigenvalues degeneracy , this explains the non - symmetric closeness in ( i ) ) . ]    here we use a simple six - site network model to study ways in which quantum effects lead to non - intuitive results , and how methods based on different quantum properties can , accordingly , lead to very different choices of communities .",
    "we begin with two disconnected cliques of three nodes each , where all hamiltonian matrix elements within the groups are identical and real .",
    "[ fig : phase - sensitive - graph ] illustrates this highly symmetric topology .",
    "the community detection method based on quantum transport identifies the two fully - connected groups as two separate communities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - sensitive - graph]a ) , as is expected .",
    "contrastingly , the methods based on fidelity predict counter - intuitively only a single community ; two disconnected nodes can retain coherence and , by this measure , be considered part of the same community ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - sensitive - graph]b ) .",
    "this symmetry captured by the fidelity - based community structure breaks down if we introduce random perturbations into the hamiltonian .",
    "specifically , the fidelity - based closeness  @xmath101 is sensitive to perturbations of the order  @xmath102 , above which the community structure is divided into the two groups of three ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - sensitive - graph]c ) expected from transport considerations .",
    "thus we may tune the resolution of this community structure method to asymmetric perturbations by varying  @xmath52 .",
    "due to quantum interference we expect that the hamiltonian phases should significantly affect the quantum community partitioning .",
    "the same toy model can be used to demonstrate this effect .",
    "for example , consider adding four elements to the hamiltonian corresponding to hopping from nodes 2 and 3 to 4 and 5 ( see diagram in fig .  [ fig : phase - sensitive - graph ] ) . if these hopping elements are all identical to the others , it is the two nodes , 1 and 6 , that are not directly connected for which the inter - node transport is largest ( and thus their inter - node closeness is the largest ) .",
    "however , when the phases of the four additional elements are randomized , this transport is decreased .",
    "moreover , when the phases are canceling , the transport between nodes 1 and 6 is reduced to zero , and the closeness between them is minimized ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : phase - sensitive - graph]d[fig : phase - sensitive - graph]f ) .",
    "the fidelity method has an equally strong dependence on the phases ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : phase - sensitive - graph]g[fig : phase - sensitive - graph]i ) , with variations in the phases breaking up the network from a large central community ( with nodes 1 and 6 alone ) into the two previously identified communities .",
    "the hamiltonian of our second quantum network is constructed from the adjacency matrix @xmath97 of a classical unweighted , undirected network exhibiting a clear classical partitioning , using the relation @xmath103 .",
    "we construct  @xmath97 using the algorithm proposed by lancichinetti _",
    "et al . _  in ref .",
    "@xcite , which provides a method to construct a network with heterogeneous distribution both for the node degree and for the communities dimension and a controllable inter - community connection .",
    "we start with a rather small network of 60 nodes with average intra - community connectivity @xmath104 , and only 5% of the edges are rewired to join communities .",
    "the network is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : artificial]a . to confirm the expected",
    ", the known classical community structure is indeed obtained by the semi - classical short - time - transport algorithm   and the oslom algorithm ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : artificial]b[fig : artificial]e ) , achieving @xmath105 and @xmath106 with the known structure , respectively .",
    "the quantum methods based on the long - time average of both transport and fidelity reproduce the main features of the original community structure while unveiling new characteristics .",
    "the transport - based long - time average method ( @xmath107 relative to the classical partitioning ) exhibits disconnected communities , i.e.  the corresponding subgraph is disconnected .",
    "this behavior can be explained by interference - enhanced quantum walker dynamics , as exhibited by the toy model in the previous subsection .",
    "the long - time average fidelity method ( @xmath108 ) returns the four main classical communities plus a number of single - node communities .",
    "both methods demonstrate that the quantum and classical community structures are unsurprisingly different , with the quantum community structure clearly dependent on the quantum property being optimized , more so than the different classical partitionings .      as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : quantumnet ] , due to interference the dynamics of the quantum system can change drastically if the phases of the hamiltonian elements are non - zero .",
    "this is known as a chiral quantum walk  @xcite .",
    "such walks exhibit , for example , time - reversal symmetry breaking of transport between sites  @xcite and it has been proposed that nature might actually make use of phase controlled interference in transport processes  @xcite .",
    "oslom , our semi - classical short - time transport algorithm and other classical community partitioning methods are insensitive to changes in the hopping phases .",
    "thus , by establishing that the quantum community structure is sensitive to such changes in phase , as expected from above , we show that classical methods are inadequate for finding quantum community structure .    to analyze this effect we take the previous network and adjust the phases of the hamiltonian terms while preserving their absolute values .",
    "specifically , the phases are sampled randomly from a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation @xmath88 .",
    "we find that , typically , as the standard deviation @xmath88 increases , when comparing quantum communities and the corresponding communities without phases the nmi between them decreases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : artificial]f .",
    "a similar deviation reflects on the comparison with the classical communities used to construct the system , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : artificial]g .",
    "this sensitivity of the quantum community structures to phases , as revealed by the nmi , confirms the expected inadequacy of classical methods .",
    "the partitioning based on long - time average fidelity seems to be the most sensitive to phases .",
    "an increasing number of biological networks of non - trivial topology are being described using quantum mechanics .",
    "for example , light harvesting complexes have drawn significant attention in the quantum information community .",
    "one of these is the lhcii , a two - layer 14-chromophore complex embedded into a protein matrix ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lhcii ] for a sketch ) that collects light energy and directs it toward the reaction center where it is transformed into chemical energy .",
    "the system can be described as a network of 14 sites connected with a non - trivial topology .",
    "the single - exciton subspace is spanned by 14 basis states , each corresponding to a node in the network , and the hamiltonian in this basis was found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in a widely adopted chromophore community structure",
    "@xcite , the sites are partitioned _ by hand _ into communities according to their physical closeness ( e.g. there are no communities spanning the two layers of the complex ) , and the strength of hamiltonian couplings ( see the top right of fig .  [",
    "fig : lhcii ] ) . here",
    ", we apply our _ ab initio _ automated quantum community detection algorithms to the same hamiltonian .",
    "all of our approaches predict a modified partitioning to that commonly used in the literature .",
    "the method based on short - time transport returns communities that do not connect the two layers .",
    "this semi - classical approach relies only on the coupling strength of the system , without considering interference effects , and provides the closest partitioning to the one provided by the literature ( also relying only on the coupling strengths ) .",
    "meanwhile , the methods based on the long - time transport and fidelity return very similar community partitionings , in which node 6 on one layer and node 9 on the other are in the same community .",
    "these two long - time community partitionings are identical , except one of the communities predicted by the fidelity based method is split when using the transport based method .",
    "it is therefore a difference in modularity only .",
    "the classical oslom algorithm fails spectacularly : it gives only one significant community involving nodes 11 and 12 which exhibit the highest coupling strength . if assigning a community to each node is forced , a unique community with all nodes is provided .",
    "note that here we have used the lhcii closed - system dynamics , valid only for short times , to partition it . as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : quantumcom ] , for the purpose of analysis one could alternatively use the less tractable open - system dynamics to obtain a partitioning that reflects the environment of the lhcii  @xcite . however , we argue that community partitioning , e.g.  that based on the closed - system dynamics , is essential in devising approaches to simulating the full open - system dynamics .",
    "we have developed methods to detect community structure in quantum systems , thereby extending the purview of community detection from classical networks to include quantum networks .",
    "our approach involves the development of a number of methods that focus on different characteristics of the system and return a community structure reflecting that specific characteristic .",
    "the variation of the quantum community structure with the property on which this structure is based seems greater than for classical community structures .",
    "all our methods are based on the full unitary dynamics of the system , as described by the hamiltonian , and account for quantum effects such as coherent evolution and interference .",
    "in fact phases are often fundamental to characterizing the system evolution .",
    "for example , harel _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that in light harvesting complexes interference between pathways is important even at room temperature . in our light harvesting complex example ( see sec.[sec : lhcii ] ) , the _ ab - initio _ community structures provided by the long - time measures propose consistent communities that stretch across the lumenal and stromal layers of the complex , absent in the structure proposed by the community .    since we consider time evolution , the averaging time  @xmath52 acts as a tuning parameter for the partitioning methods . in the case of transport",

    "this allows the study of networks with node numbers up the thousands and tens of thousands , which is appropriate for the real - world quantum networks currently being considered .    as with classical community structure , there are many possible definitions of a quantum community .",
    "we restricted ourselves to two broad classes based on transport and fidelity under coherent evolution , both based on dynamics , though in the limits considered in this paper the closenesses and thus quantum community structure can be expressed purely in terms of static properties .",
    "we end by briefly discussing some other possible definitions based on statics ( the earliest classical community definitions were based on statics  @xcite ) .",
    "the first type is based on some quantum state  @xmath113 , e.g. the ground state of  @xmath44 .",
    "we might wish to partition the network by repeatedly diving the network in two based on minimally entangled bipartitions .",

    "we might partition the hilbert space into unions of the eigenspaces of  @xmath44 by treating the corresponding eigenvalues as 1d coordinates and applying a traditional agglomerative or divisive clustering algorithm on them .",
    "note that the resulting partitioning would normally not be in the position basis .",
    "the use of community detection in quantum systems addresses an open challenge in the drive to unite quantum physics and complex network science , and we expect such partitioning , based on our definitions or extensions such as above , to be used extensively in making the large quantum systems currently being targeted by quantum physicists tractable to numerical analysis .",

    "<S> the prediction of our simplest algorithm , semi - classical in nature , mostly agrees with a proposed partitioning for the lhcii found in quantum chemistry literature , whereas our fully quantum treatment of the problem of uncover a new , consistent and appropriately quantum community structure .    </S>",
    "<S> the identification of the community structure within a network addresses the problem of characterizing the mesoscopic boundary between the microscopic scale of basic network components ( herein called nodes ) and the macroscopic scale of the whole network  @xcite . in non - quantum networks , </S>",

    "<S> @xcite ) . in quantum networks , as researchers explore networks of an increasingly non - trivial geometry and large size  @xcite , their analysis and understanding will involve identifying non - trivial community structures . in this article , we devise methods to perform this task , providing an important missing component in the recent drive to unite quantum physics and complex network science @xcite .    for quantum systems , beyond being merely a tool for analysis following simulations , community partitioning is closely related to performing the simulations themselves . </S>",
    "<S> simulation is generally a difficult task @xcite , e.g.  simulating exciton transport in dissipative quantum biological networks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of resources required to exactly simulate such processes scales exponentially with the number of nodes . to overcome this , one must in general seek to describe only limited correlations between certain parts of the network @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mean - field @xcite and tensor - network methods @xcite assume correlations between bi - partitions of the system along some node - structure to be zero or limited by an area law . </S>",

    "<S> a simulation involves identifying a partitioning of a system for which it is appropriate to limit inter - community correlations , i.e.  is a type of community detection .    </S>",

    "<S> , researchers have divided the lhcii _ by hand _ in order to gain more insight into the system dynamics  @xcite . meanwhile , </S>",

    "<S> ab initio _ and , as we will show , the resulting communities consistently point towards a structure that is different to those previously identified for the lhcii . for larger networks , as with our artifical examples , automatic methods would appear to be the only feasible option .    </S>",
    "<S> our specific approach is to generate a hierarchical community structure @xcite by defining both inter - node and inter - community closeness . </S>",
    "<S> the optimum level in the hierarchy is determined by a modularity - based measure , which quantifies how good a choice of communities is for the quantum network on average relative to an appropriately randomized version of the network . </S>",
    "<S> although modularity - based methods are known to struggle with large sparse networks  @xcite , this work focuses on quantum systems whose size remains much smaller than the usual targets of classical community detection algorithms .    </S>",
    "<S> while the backbone of our quantum community method is shared with classical methods , the physical properties used to characterize a good community in a quantum must necessarily be very different to the properties used for a classical system . </S>",
    "<S> here we show how two quantum properties are used to obtain closeness and modularity functions : the first is the coherent transport between communities and the second is the change in the states of individual communities during a coherent evolution .     between @xmath0 nodes . </S>",
