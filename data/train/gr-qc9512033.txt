    "semiclassical effects in quantum field theory are at the very heart of many exciting developments in modern theoretical physics , e.g. , radiative corrections to the casimir force [ 1 ] , trace anomalies [ 2 ] , one - loop effective action [ 3,4 ] , symmetry breaking in the early universe [ 57 ] . in the latter class of phenomena , the one - loop effective potential for grand unified theories ( gut ) in curved backgrounds is used in the field equations to determine the symmetry - breaking pattern which is relevant for the familiar low - energy phenomenology of particle physics [ 6,7 ] . in particular , in a previous paper by the first two authors , the one - loop effective potential for so(10 ) gut theories in de sitter space was derived for the first time [ 8 ] .",
    "the main motivation of our work was the analysis of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the early universe when gut theories in good agreement with low - energy phenomenology are studied . unlike @xmath2 theories ,",
    "@xmath3 models make it possible to allocate a whole fermionic family in the single irreducible spinorial representation , and predict longer nucleon lifetimes in agreement with experimental data .",
    "this happens because lepto - quarks responsible for nucleon decays have higher masses ( with respect to @xmath2 ) , by virtue of an intermediate symmetry group .",
    "the latter lies in between the highest scale @xmath4 gev , and the electroweak scale .",
    "further details can be found in refs .",
    "[ 8,9 ] .",
    "on considering the particular mass matrix relevant for the @xmath5 symmetry - breaking direction , our main result was the numerical proof that , even when curvature effects are no longer negligible , the early universe can only reach the @xmath6 absolute minimum [ 8 ] .",
    "a naturally occurring question is whether the analytic formulas obtained in ref . [ 8 ] can be used to gain a better understanding of other phenomena occurring in the early universe .",
    "indeed , it is well - known that , according to the cosmological standard model based on einstein s general relativity , the early universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic [ 10,11 ] , and gravity couples to the energy - momentum tensor of matter . under the previous assumptions of symmetry and homogeneity ( cf . ref .",
    "[ 12 ] ) , the space - time metric can be locally cast in the form [ 10 ] @xmath7 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the cosmic scale factor , @xmath90,\\pi[$ ] , @xmath100,2\\pi[$ ] and , denoting by @xmath11 the constant curvature of the three - dimensional spatial sections , @xmath12 or @xmath13 if @xmath14 respectively .",
    "here we focus on spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmologies , for which @xmath15 .",
    "the aim of the present work has been therefore to study the relevance of so(10 ) gut models for gravitational physics within the more general framework of frw cosmologies . in this case , the analysis performed in ref . [ 13 ] enables one to use , at least for typical gut - inflationary models characterized by a phase - transition temperature @xmath16 , the flat - space limit of the coleman - weinberg one - loop effective potential [ 5 ] .",
    "what happens is that the one - loop field equations in frw cosmologies are an involved set of integro - differential equations [ 13 ] .",
    "in scalar electrodynamics , the nonlocal correction to the coleman - weinberg effective potential results from the coupling of a scalar field @xmath17 to the gravitational background and may lead to dissipative effects in the early universe .",
    "more precisely , nonlocal terms in the field equations may be approximated very well by a function of the form [ 13 ] @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a positive - definite function of the conformal time @xmath20 .",
    "the first term in round brackets leads to a further quantum correction to the energy density of the scalar field ( for slowly varying @xmath19 ) , while the second term is purely dissipative [ 13 ] .",
    "however , nonlocal terms _ do not _ modify the pattern of minima found in static de sitter space .",
    "thus , for numerical purposes , even in the nonabelian case , curvature effects on the one - loop potential are very small , and can be neglected at the gut energy scale .",
    "this is the basic approximation on which the present paper relies .    in sec .",

    "spherical coordinates for the higgs field are used to obtain a convenient parametrization of the classical part of the potential .",
    "the flat - space limit of the one - loop effective potential is then studied in sec .",
    "semiclassical field equations are studied in sec .",
    "v , and their numerical solution is found in sec .",
    "the reheating process is then briefly described in sec .",
    "vii , while the concluding remarks are presented in sec .",
    "in the inflationary models driven by scalar fields , the universe contains different species of matter , i.e. , radiation and scalar particles ( inflatons ) .",
    "the latter , characterized by a higher energy level with respect to the others , completely determine the dynamics of the universe , making all remaining contributions negligible . a theoretical scheme in which fundamental scalar particles naturally occur ( higgs field ) and lead to symmetry breaking are the gut theories .",
    "in this case the energies involved are compatible with the levels required for an _ efficient _ inflation .",
    "thus , we consider an inflationary model in which the inflaton coincides with the higgs field of a gut theory , corresponding to the highest energy scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking . in particular , we choose the most relevant ones which are the so(10 ) gut theories with higgs field belonging to the @xmath21-dimensional irreducible representation ( @xmath22 ) [ 8 ] .    within this framework ( we denote hereafter by @xmath23 the fields corresponding to scalar particles ) , and assuming homogeneous field configurations @xmath24 , the _ semiclassical _ lagrangian reads @xmath25 \\;,\\ ] ] where the _ dot _ stands for @xmath26 , the _ prime _ for @xmath27 and @xmath28 denotes the arbitrary coupling of @xmath23 to the gravitational background with scalar curvature @xmath29 $ ] . in eq . (",
    "2.1 ) the classical potential has been replaced by the one - loop effective potential @xmath30 , i.e. , the gauge degrees of freedom have been integrated over .",
    "note also that the first two terms in ( 2.1 ) yield the coupling @xmath31 , after integration by parts in the action .",
    "starting from ( 2.1 ) one gets the two semiclassical equations of motion @xmath32 - { 1 \\over 8 } { \\dot{\\phi}^2",
    "\\over f } + { 1 \\over 4 } { v^{(1 ) } \\over f}=0 \\ ; , \\ ] ] and @xmath33 f'(\\phi)+{\\delta v^{(1 ) } \\over \\delta \\phi } = 0 \\;.\\ ] ] in general , for a nonminimally coupled real scalar field , @xmath34 . in our case , in the light of the results obtained in ref . [ 13 ] , we neglect all contributions of the curvature to the scalar potential , and hence we can assume minimally coupled scalar fields ( for which @xmath35 vanishes ) .",
    "in a gauge unifying theory like @xmath3 , the higgs field ( fundamental scalar particles ) belongs to one or more irreducible representations ( hereafter referred to as irr s ) of the gauge group , and its dynamics is ruled by a higgs potential .",
    "these particles provide the correct residual symmetry for the model in the low - energy limit , through a spontaneous symmetry - breaking mechanism . to study the inflation corresponding to the highest energy scale ( @xmath36 ) of spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb )",
    ", we can consider the only contribution of the irr responsible for the ssb at that scale .    in the present case",
    ", we consider the most general renormalizable higgs potential constructed by using a massless and minimally coupled irr @xmath22 only , which is obtained by the completely anti - symmetrized product of four different @xmath37 s as @xmath38 } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath39 is a normalization constant .",
    "the @xmath22 irr has four independent quartic invariants , i.e. , @xmath40 and three non - trivial invariants , hence the higgs potential we are going to construct is a function of these [ 8 ] @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are arbitrary coefficients , and @xmath46 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "we will see in due course what is the meaning of this constant and how it can be fixed .",
    "unfortunately , in view of the technical difficulties to express ( 3.2 ) in terms of the @xmath21 degrees of freedom , we restrict our analysis to the only directions invariant under the subgroup @xmath47 .",
    "this restriction , however , remains relevant for the aims of this paper , since it leads to the correct electroweak phenomenology at low energies for the model .",
    "the most general singlet @xmath48 with respect to the group @xmath5 contained in the @xmath22 representation is [ 8 ] @xmath49 where @xmath50 $ ] and @xmath51 .",
    "in particular , by varying @xmath52 and @xmath53 in their ranges , one gets the following residual - symmetry groups [ 8 ] :    @xmath54    @xmath55    @xmath56    @xmath57    @xmath58    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the @xmath61-component of the @xmath62 group .    inserting ( 3.3 ) into ( 3.2 ) one finds the tree - level potential @xmath63 where [ 8 ] @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67^{2 } + { 3 \\over 4 } \\sin^4{\\theta } \\sin^4{\\varphi } \\ ; , \\ ] ] @xmath68^{2}+ \\sin^4{\\theta } \\sin^2{\\varphi } \\cos^2{\\varphi } + f_{\\alpha } \\ ; , \\ ] ] @xmath69^{2 } + 30 f_{\\gamma } -25 f_{\\alpha } \\ ; .\\ ] ] since in the following analysis @xmath70 is always negative and @xmath71 may take negative values , the tree - level potential ( 3.5 ) is unbounded from below , unless we impose the restriction [ 8 ] @xmath72 note also that contributions proportional to a cubic term in the potential are set to zero , since we are assuming @xmath73 invariance of our model .",
    "as shown by coleman and weinberg [ 5 ] , the effects of quantum fluctuations on the scalar potential , due to both gauge bosons and self - interactions , may account for the spontaneous symmetry breaking occurring in gauge theories without assuming from the beginning the presence of negative quadratic terms for the higgs field .",
    "these phenomena are best tackled in terms of the one - loop effective potential [ 58,13,14 ] .",
    "this provides , in our case , the appropriate tool for studying the phase transition due to scalar dynamics .",
    "the one - loop effective potential @xmath74 corresponding to the classical expression ( 3.5 ) in the flat - space limit is obtained in ref . [ 8 ] .",

    "after defining the dimensionless time @xmath83 the higgs field @xmath48 can be seen , in the @xmath3-space , as the position vector in @xmath84 , given in spherical coordinates as @xmath85 .",
    "thus , by taking its derivative with respect to @xmath86 one has @xmath87 with our notation , it is convenient to introduce a dimensionless expression for ( 4.6 ) obtained multiplying it by @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89 \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as far as the constant @xmath90 is concerned , it has to be fixed by requiring that a vanishing potential energy should correspond to the absolute minimum for @xmath91 . by denoting with @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 the absolute - minimum coordinates",
    ", we have @xmath95=0 .",
    "moreover , @xmath92 makes it possible to determine also @xmath82 , bearing in mind that the spontaneous symmetry - breaking scale is @xmath96 , which is fixed for the particular model by the low - energy predictions , and then @xmath97 .    in this scheme ,",
    "the semiclassical equations for @xmath98 [ 15 ] take the form ( from now on , the dot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath86 ) @xmath99 - 3 k \\dot{y } \\sqrt{\\tilde{\\rho}_{\\phi } } -{\\partial \\over \\partial y } { \\widetilde v}^{(1)}(\\tilde{\\phi } ) \\ ; , \\\\ \\ddot{\\theta } & = & - 2 { \\dot{y } \\over y } \\dot{\\theta } + \\sin{\\theta } \\cos{\\theta } \\ ;",

    "this is the so - called reheating process , and the knowledge of the value of @xmath86 , say @xmath102 , for which this actually happens , enables one to determine the total @xmath0-fold number @xmath103 of the inflationary model by solving the differential equation @xmath104 a brief description of the reheating mechanism for our particular model is presented in sec .",
    "a necessary requirement to perform a numerical analysis of the differential equations obtained in sec .",
    "v , is a good knowledge of the absolute minimum of the potential ( 5.2 ) . as already stated in sec .",
    "iii , if the inequality ( 3.12 ) is satisfied , the effective potential is bounded from below , but unfortunately , this does not ensure that quantum corrections to the tree - level potential will make it possible to fix the value of the field at the minimum , @xmath92 , so that it is sensibly different from zero .",
    "thus , one has to choose among the values of @xmath71 , @xmath105 , @xmath70 and @xmath45 satisfying ( 3.12 ) , the ones for which a symmetry breaking actually occurs [ 8 ] .    in tab . 1",
    ", we report for two choices of the free parameters of the classical potential ( 3.5 ) the corresponding values of @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath92 and hence the values of @xmath82 and @xmath108 .",
    "the parameters @xmath109 and @xmath45 have been chosen in such a way that small couplings are achieved , and the minimum of @xmath110 is of order 1 .    in fig . 1",
    ", we plot the solution for @xmath110 ( obtained by means of the nag library routine d02caf ) corresponding to the initial conditions relevant for the @xmath111 symmetry - breaking direction ( see ( 3.4c ) ) , i.e. @xmath112 .",
    "note that a vanishing value of @xmath113 and @xmath114 is the one resulting from our particular choice of residual - symmetry direction , along which the inflationary dynamics evolves .",
    "moreover , a very small value of @xmath115 , which approaches zero , reflects our choice to start from a singlet state which has a complete @xmath3 symmetry ( hence @xmath116 ) .",
    "of course , a @xmath115 value which differs from zero is only taken for numerical convenience , but our results are essentially independent of @xmath115 , providing this is very small . for numerical purposes",
    ", it has been thus convenient to re - express the eqs .",
    "( 5.3)(5.5 ) in terms of the variables defined in eqs .",
    "( a2)(a4 ) of the appendix . however , we keep using the @xmath117 parametrization in our paper , since it makes it easier to describe symmetry breaking .",
    "what happens is that @xmath110 characterizes the dynamics which is independent of the symmetry - breaking direction , whereas @xmath52 and @xmath53 define the various symmetry - breaking directions . after a slow - roll phase which is not shown in fig . 1 for the sake of clarity",
    ", @xmath110 starts increasing until it reaches a region where it oscillates in the neighboorhood of a relative minimum .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath52 remains equal to @xmath118 .",
    "interestingly , the time necessary to reach the region of rapid oscillation for @xmath110 is of order @xmath119 sec , and the corresponding @xmath0-fold number ( see ( 5.7 ) ) is @xmath120 .",
    "however , such a large @xmath0-fold number is only achieved with the help of a severe fine tuning of the @xmath121 value .",
    "this is indeed a peculiar property of coleman - weinberg potentials , which have a relative maximum at @xmath122 .",
    "further details about the oscillating phase and the end of inflation will be given in sec .",
    "vii .    in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath110 is plotted against @xmath86 when the choice of @xmath109 and @xmath45 described on the second line of numerical values of tab .",
    "1 is made .",
    "in such a case , the following initial conditions are chosen : @xmath123 . in this case , however , @xmath110 oscillates in a neighboorhood of the _ absolute _ minimum ( cf .",
    "1 ) . the same happens for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , whose evolution is not shown for brevity .",
    "moreover , a fine tuning of the initial conditions leads again to an @xmath0-fold number of order 100 , and the duration of the inflationary stage is the same as in fig . 1 .    the cases described in figs . 1 and 2 are indeed also relevant for the analysis of the reheating stage of the early universe , as shown in sec .",
    "vii , where a brief outline of such a phenomenon is presented .",
    "when the energy stored in the scalar - field configuration is released to the relativistic degrees of freedom ( hereafter @xmath124 denotes the corresponding energy density ) and begins to dominate the total energy of the universe , the evolution undergoes the so - called reheating phase .",
    "such a phase , which is the necessary last stage of the inflationary dynamics , is as important as the exponential expansion itself , since it ensures the end of the exponential growth and the reheating of the universe .",
    "in fact , if the radiation energy dominates the total energy of the system , through the equation of state , the energy density and the pressure @xmath125 satisfy the condition @xmath126 , which implies @xmath127 .",
    "according to the recent models of reheating , this process can be divided into three stages [ 1618 ] . in the first stage",
    ", the scalar field @xmath23 decays into massive bosons via parametric resonance .",
    "the second stage consists in the decay of previously produced particles , and the last stage leads to thermalization ( for our purposes , only the first two stages will be considered ) .",
    "as far as the parametric resonance is concerned , it can be studied starting from the equation for quantum fluctuations of a scalar field @xmath128 , quadratically coupled to @xmath23 . as shown in ref . [",
    "16 ] , on setting @xmath129 , such an equation may be cast in the form @xmath130\\omega_{k}=0 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where the _ prime _ denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , @xmath131 ( @xmath132 being the physical momentum ) , and @xmath133 . in the model considered in refs .",
    "[ 1618 ] , @xmath134 is the amplitude of oscillations of the field @xmath23 , and @xmath135 is a small coupling constant .",
    "interestingly , an exponential instability of the solutions exists and it can be interpreted as a rich particle production .",
    "this phenomenon is best tackled by studying the stability / instability chart of the mathieu equation [ 1618 ] .",
    "in particular , the field @xmath128 may be given by the fluctuations of the scalar field @xmath23 itself .",
    "in such a case , one has to start from eq .",
    "( a9 ) of the appendix , where the effect of @xmath136 is neglected , following ref .",
    "parametric resonance is only achieved if @xmath137 therein is positive for some values of @xmath138 , in the neighboorhood of which the scalar field starts oscillating . in figs . 3 and 4",
    ", we plot the function @xmath139 against @xmath52 and @xmath53 , for the values of @xmath109 and @xmath45 reported on the first and second line of numerical values of tab .",
    "1 , respectively . in each figure",
    ", the closed curve represents those values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 for which @xmath139 vanishes . within the region bounded by such a curve , @xmath139 takes negative values , whereas it is positive outside .",
    "interestingly , in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 lie in the region of parametric resonance , i.e. , outside the region where @xmath140 , while the converse holds in fig .",
    "4 . of course , since fig . 1 corresponds to a case when @xmath52 remains equal to zero , parametric resonance is indeed achieved because , for this particular choice of parameters , @xmath141 is positive , as shown in fig .",
    "thus , our analysis shows that the inflationary dynamics with residual symmetry @xmath142 ( see ( 3.4c ) ) leads to slow roll and also to parametric resonance .",
    "these properties add evidence in favour of so(10 ) gut models being physically relevant , although one should bear in mind that fine tuning problems remain .",
    "however , the case described by fig .",
    "4 is not , by itself , ruled out .",
    "one has instead to consider a scalar field @xmath128 which is _ not _ given by the fluctuations of @xmath23 itself [ 1618 ] .",
    "we now briefly consider the second stage of the reheating process . once that the quantum fluctuations of the @xmath143 irr have been produced via parametric resonance , they have to decay into relativistic degrees of freedom , whose mass is negligible with respect to the @xmath36 scale .",
    "note that the decay of the @xmath143 representation into a fermion - antifermion pair can not occur , since it makes it necessary to introduce a yukawa coupling of the @xmath143 to fermions , which would lead in turn to an undesirable mass term for fermions of order @xmath36 . on similar ground ,",
    "any gauge boson coupled to @xmath143 would acquire mass at the scale @xmath36 , and hence such a coupling can not lead to decays into relativistic degrees of freedom .",
    "one is thus left with decays into other higgs particles of smaller mass .",
    "indeed , the presence of lighter higgs fields in gut theories is particularly evident in @xmath3 , where the spontaneous symmetry breaking which leads to the standard electroweak model occurs in two steps at different mass scales : i.e. , @xmath144 where @xmath96 is of order @xmath145 to be compatible with the lower limit on proton decay , @xmath146 is one of the intermediate symmetry groups appearing in eqs .",
    "( 3.4a)(3.4f ) , and the scale @xmath147 is the one relevant for neutrino physics .",
    "note that every breaking phase in ( 7.2 ) is mediated by a different scalar field belonging to a irr of @xmath3 .",
    "a realistic model can be constructed for example by considering in addition to the @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , the scalar fields ( @xmath148 , @xmath149 ) belonging to the representation @xmath150 , and two ten - dimensional irreducible representations @xmath151 which mediate the electroweak symmetry breaking [ 19 ] @xmath152 in this model , to obtain the above symmetry - breaking pattern , one has to replace the simple tree - level potential of eq .",
    "( 3.2 ) by a much more complicated expression @xmath153 ( see eqs . ( 7)(11 ) of ref .",
    "still , as far as the inflation at the highest energy scale is concerned , only the terms of the potential containing uniquely the @xmath154 representation with the associated scalars are relevant .",
    "this is why we neglected in ( 3.2 ) the contributions resulting from the other representations .",
    "the other terms , however , are important when the second stage of reheating is considered , since they can mediate the decay of the massive higgs in the lighter @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath155 .",
    "the interacting terms between different scalar representations are the ones actually relevant in that they do not provide mass for light particles , while decay processes are allowed .",
    "such interacting terms occur in quartic form , involve the whole set of representations of @xmath3 , and hence , being linear in @xmath23 , do not provide mass for the lighter higgs particles ( eq . ( 11 ) of ref . [ 19 ] ) .",
    "our paper has studied the relevance for inflationary cosmology of a nonsupersymmetric gut theory which is consistent with the available data on nucleon lifetimes .",
    "this is the @xmath3 model in the 210-dimensional irreducible representation ( see refs . [ 9,20 ] and literature cited therein ) .",
    "starting from a quartic tree - level potential in the case of minimal coupling , we have studied the flat - space limit of the semiclassical field equations , where the one - loop effective potential contains the logarithmic terms which result from the coleman - weinberg method for the evaluation of radiative corrections [ 5 ] .",
    "following ref . [ 8 ] , when the higgs scalar field belongs to the 210-dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath3 ( this corresponds to the highest energy levels ) , attention has been restricted to the mass matrix relevant for the @xmath47 symmetry - breaking direction , to agree with the low - energy phenomenology of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the main result of our investigation is that the inflationary dynamics with residual symmetry @xmath156 leads to a sufficiently long inflationary stage , and then a reheating process occurs via parametric resonance and subsequent decay of the particles produced previously .",
    "such processes are three - body decays of @xmath143 into the massless components of the @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 representations , and result from the mutual quartic coupling of all irreducible representations . the intermediate symmetry @xmath160 has been extensively studied in the literature on particle physics , since it occurs in the most promising @xmath3 models [ 9,20 ] .",
    "thus , a natural and deep link between low - energy phenomenology , grand unification , inflationary cosmology and physical processes in the very early universe seems to emerge from our work .    of course",
    ", we have only studied some _ particular _ values of the parameters of the tree - level potential .",
    "although particle physics and cosmology lead to restrictions on such parameters , our choices are by no means exhaustive .",
    "it now appears interesting to get a more quantitative understanding of the reheating process outlined in sec .",
    "moreover , from the point of view of perturbative properties of quantum field theory , it is necessary to study in detail the nonlocal contributions to the semiclassical field equations .",
    "these arise already in scalar electrodynamics [ 13 ] , by virtue of the coupling of the scalar field to the gravitational background , and are receiving careful consideration since they are related to dissipative and nondissipative phenomena in the early universe [ 13,21 ] .",
    "it also appears interesting to study the corrections to the effective potential resulting from a suitable generalization to @xmath3 models of the technique described in ref . [ 22 ] .",
    "we are much indebted to franco buccella for teaching us all what we know about @xmath3 models , and to gianpiero mangano , ofelia pisanti and luigi rosa for several useful conversations about the research described in this publication .      to obtain the equation for the quantum fluctuations of the @xmath22 irr",
