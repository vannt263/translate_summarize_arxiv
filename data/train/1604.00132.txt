    "<S> we present an ab initio study of the electronic stopping power of protons in copper over a wide range of proton velocities @xmath0 where we take into account non - linear effects . </S>",
    "<S> time - dependent density functional theory coupled with molecular dynamics is used to study electronic excitations produced by energetic protons . </S>",
    "<S> a plane - wave pseudopotential scheme is employed to solve the time - dependent kohn - sham equations for a moving ion in a periodic crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic excitations and the band structure determine the stopping power of the material and alter the interatomic forces for both channeling and off - channeling trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> our off - channeling results are in quantitative agreement with experiments , and at low velocity they unveil a crossover region of superlinear velocity dependence ( with a power of @xmath1 ) in the velocity range @xmath2 , which we associate to the copper crystalline electronic band structure . </S>",
    "<S> the results are rationalized by simple band models connecting two separate regimes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the limit of electronic stopping @xmath3 is not as simple as phenomenological models suggest and it plagued by band - structure effects . </S>"
