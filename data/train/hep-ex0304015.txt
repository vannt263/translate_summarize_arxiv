    "semileptonic decays play a prominent role in @xmath1 physics , because they are simple to understand theoretically and have been used to find @xmath9 mixing  @xcite and the values of the ckm matrix elements : @xmath10  @xcite and @xmath11  @xcite .    for many years",
    "there have been some mysteries in the @xmath1 meson semileptonic decays .",
    "for example , the measured semileptonic branching fraction of @xmath1 mesons  @xcite is about 2% lower absolute ( 20% relative ) than theoretical predictions  @xcite . recently , there has been some progress made on both the experimental and theoretical fronts  @xcite , which gives values in better agreement with each other .",
    "more measurements are needed to improve the existing results as well as to precisely test the new theoretical calculations .",
    "the majority of semileptonic @xmath1 decays appear to proceed with single mesons accompanying the lepton - antineutrino pair .",
    "there is no experimental evidence for baryons in semileptonic @xmath1 decay .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we will focus on the search for these decay modes .",
    "baryon production in @xmath1 meson semileptonic decays requires the `` popping '' of two quark - antiquark pairs from the vacuum . for instance , in a @xmath12 decay , the quark content of the baryons will be @xmath13 when @xmath3 , or @xmath14 when @xmath15 .",
    "the decay mode with the lightest mass @xmath3 final state including a proton would be @xmath16 . other higher mass hadronic resonances could also contribute to semileptonic baryon decays with a final state having an electron and an antiproton .",
    "there is little guidance for the probable mix of states that might be available so we choose a model with a mixture of modes to study @xmath3 decays . for @xmath15 decays ,",
    "the lightest mass final state would be either @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "there is a large group of higher resonances possible .",
    "we choose to study only the @xmath17 state in our @xmath15 studies .    a previous cleo  ii measurement of the decay @xmath19 employed full reconstruction for @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "that analysis yielded an upper limit of @xmath21 this implies @xmath22 using the pdg value for @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "there is also an upper limit on the inclusive rate of @xmath24@xcite from argus .",
    "there are no measurements of the @xmath17 decay .",
    "we perform partial reconstruction of the decay @xmath25 , by identifying events with an @xmath26 and @xmath27 emerging promptly from the @xmath1 and examining the angular distributions between them .",
    "muons are not used in this analysis because they are only well - identified above 1.4  @xmath28 momentum .",
    "few signal leptons are expected at such momenta .    in section",
    "ii , we describe the data sample and event selection .",
    "the event selection criteria are tailored to search for the decay @xmath19 .",
    "we discuss the angular distribution of the signal and main sources of backgrounds in section iii .",
    "section iv describes how we fit the data distribution for the @xmath3 modes . in section",
    "v , we discuss the analysis for @xmath17 .",
    "the last section summarizes our results .",
    "the analysis described here is based on the data recorded with the cleo detector at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) .",
    "the cleo detector  @xcite is a general purpose detector that provides charged particle tracking , precision electromagnetic calorimetry , charged particle identification and muon detection .",
    "charged particle detection over 95% of the solid angle is achieved by tracking devices in two different configurations . in the first configuration ( cleo  ii ) , tracking is provided by three concentric wire chambers while in the second configuration ( cleo  ii.v ) , the innermost wire chamber is replaced by a precision three - layer silicon vertex detector  @xcite and the drift chamber gas was changed from 50 - 50% @xmath29 to 60 - 40% @xmath30 .",
    "energy loss ( @xmath31 ) in the outer drift chamber and hits in the time of flight system just beyond it provide information on particle identification .",
    "photon and electron showers are detected over @xmath32 of @xmath33 steradians in an array of 7800 csi scintillation counters . the electromagnetic energy resolution is found to be @xmath34 ( @xmath35 in gev ) in the central region , corresponding to the polar angle of a track s momentum vector with respect to the _ z _ axis ( beam line ) , @xmath36 .",
    "a magnetic field of 1.5 t is provided by a superconducting coil which surrounds the calorimeter and tracking chambers .",
    "a total integrated luminosity of 9.1 fb@xmath37 was collected by the cleo  ii and cleo  ii.v configurations at the center - of - mass energy corresponding to the @xmath0 , corresponding to @xmath38 @xmath39 pairs .",
    "an additional integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb@xmath37 taken at energies 60 mev below the @xmath39 threshold provides an estimate of the continuum background events due to @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "all events considered pass the standard cleo hadronic event criteria , which require at least 3 well - reconstructed charged tracks , a total visible energy of at least 15% of the center of mass energy and an event vertex consistent with the known @xmath42 interaction point . in order to remove @xmath43 continuum contributions , the ratio of the second to zeroth fox - wolfram moments  @xcite",
    "is required to be less than 0.35 .    charged electron and antiproton candidates",
    "are selected from tracks that are well - reconstructed , and not identified as a muon .",
    "we accept only those charged tracks that are observed in the barrel region of the detector , which corresponds to @xmath44 cos(@xmath45 ) @xmath46 .",
    "electrons with momenta between 0.6  @xmath28 and 1.5  @xmath28 are identified by requiring that the ratio of their energy deposited in the csi calorimeter and their momentum measured in the tracking system be close to unity and that the ionization energy loss measured by the tracking system be consistent with the electron hypothesis .",
    "the ratio of the log of the likelihood for the electron hypothesis to that for a hadron is required to be greater than 3 .",
    "electrons within the fiducial volume in this momentum range are identified with an efficiency of @xmath4794% . where possible , electrons from @xmath48 conversion , @xmath49 dalitz decays , and @xmath50 decays are explicitly vetoed by cuts on the appropriate invariant mass distribution . antiprotons with momentum between 0.2  @xmath28 and 1.5  @xmath28",
    "are identified using the combined information from @xmath31 and tof measurements .",
    "antiproton candidates must lie within 3.0 standard deviations ( @xmath51 ) of the antiproton hypothesis and outside of 2.0 @xmath51 for each of the kaon and pion hypotheses .    to suppress correlated background ( see below ) of the @xmath1 , we perform a primary vertex ( @xmath42 interaction point ) constrained fit to the combinations of the electron and antiproton .",
    "the fit is required to have a @xmath52 per degree of freedom less than 10 .",
    "we study the angular correlations between the prompt electron and antiproton .",
    "if we define @xmath53 as the angle between the electron and the antiproton , the corresponding cos(@xmath53 ) distribution is peaked at @xmath54 ( back - to - back ) for signal events .",
    "figure  [ fig : shapes ] shows the @xmath55 distributions for @xmath19 signal events and various backgrounds .",
    "we will use the difference between the signal and background shapes in this distribution to fit for the amount of signal in our sample .",
    "there are four main sources of backgrounds as follows :    * uncorrelated background : + this includes the e/@xmath56 combinations where the electron and antiproton are from opposite @xmath1 meson decays ( see figure  [ fig : shapes](b ) ) .",
    "the @xmath55 distribution of this background is almost flat , modulo a fiducial acceptance correction as seen from monte carlo . *",
    "correlated background : + this includes non - prompt e/@xmath56 combinations , which are from the same @xmath1 meson but not from a signal event , such as in the decay chain : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ( see figure  [ fig : shapes](c ) ) .",
    "the @xmath60 distribution of this background as found from monte carlo is also peaked near @xmath61 , but less sharply than signal . * continuum background : + this is the background due to non-@xmath39 sources , _ i.e. _ @xmath62 , where @xmath41 ( see figure  [ fig : shapes](d ) ) found using data collected at energies below the @xmath0 . * fake e/@xmath56 background : + this is due to particles misidentified as electrons or antiprotons and is found using data .    ) .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath55 distributions between electrons and antiprotons , for each of the cleo  ii and cleo  ii.v datasets separately and then combine them .",
    "the @xmath63 angular distribution found from the off - resonance data sample is scaled by luminosity and the energy dependent four - flavor cross section and then subtracted ( the scale factor is approximately 2 ) . we subtract the fake electron and antiproton backgrounds using data distributions as described below .",
    "after these subtractions , the angular distribution is composed of uncorrelated background , correlated background , and possibly signal . using monte carlo",
