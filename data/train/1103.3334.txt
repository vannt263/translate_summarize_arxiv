    "such a force may be realized using an optical dipole excitation created by a pair of off - resonant excitation laser beams . in short , the application of a state - dependent ac stark shift to trapped ions in a spatially graded light field results in the ions experiencing differential forces dependent upon their internal quantum states ( e.g. for a qubit @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
