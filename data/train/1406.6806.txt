    "scanning gate microscopy ( sgm ) @xcite is a technique that probes the local properties of a semiconductor system by measurement of the current flowing through the device as a function of the position of the charged atomic force microscope tip sweeping above the sample area .",
    "the charged tip is capacitively coupled to the electron gas and introduces a local perturbation to the potential landscape .",
    "the technique allows for mapping the charge flow patterns , local density of states at the fermi level , and/or the confined charge density.@xcite sgm has been applied for gated devices based on two - dimensional electron gas in iii - v heterostructures,@xcite on quantum dots induced in quantum wires,@xcite graphene systems @xcite and carbon nanotubes .",
    "@xcite for open systems,@xcite the information on the properties of the electron system is derived from the maps of conductance variation as functions of the tip position . for closed quantum dots ",
    "systems that are weakly coupled to the electron reservoirs  in conditions of the coulomb blockade @xcite  the charged probe potential switches on the current by tuning the chemical potential of the confined @xmath0-electron system into the transport energy window fixed by the fermi energies of the drain and source electrodes.@xcite the technique  referred to as the coulomb blockade microscopy @xcite allows to extract the confined charge density by the inverse problem analysis.@xcite    in this paper we consider mapping of the electron density confined in the two - dimensional quantum dot by the coulomb blockade microscopy in external magnetic field .",
    "we focus on the ground - state transition between the maximum density droplet ( mdd ) @xcite and the ground - states at low fillings of the lowest landau level at high magnetic fields corresponding to the fractional quantum hall conditions .",
    "the transition is accompanied by a pronounced step - wise increase of the electron - electron correlation effects @xcite with formation of electron molecules in the relative coordinates of the quantum system .",
    "the electrons in the fractional quantum hall regime form a phase of properties that are between the laughlin liquid and the wigner crystal @xcite with the latter getting stronger with reduction of the filling factor of the lowest landau level @xmath1 .",
    "the maximum density droplet decay at a critical magnetic field is an abrupt counterpart of the transition from the fermi liquid to the wigner solid at zero magnetic field that appears in a continuous manner with the growth of the quantum dot size.@xcite    we consider extraction of the unperturbed charge density from the energy maps as functions of the tip position .",
    "we solve the few - electron eigenproblem using the exact diagonalization approach and calculate the energy maps for a model tip potential .",
    "we discuss the relation of the charge density as reproduced from the energy variation as a function of the tip position to the unperturbed charge density .",
    "we find that in circular quantum dots the reaction of the electron charge density to the tip undergoes a qualitative change at the crossing between the integer and fractional filling factors , with a liquid - like behavior for @xmath2 and nucleation of the single - electron islands in presence of the tip for @xmath3 .",
    "for circular quantum dots the single - electron molecular charge distributions induced by the tip for @xmath4 are not resolved by the charge densities that are reproduced from the energy maps . however , for lower symmetry of the confinement potential due to a defect in particular , the electron molecules appear in the laboratory frame at @xmath5 .",
    "the molecular charge densities pinned by the confinement potential can be extracted by the coulomb blockade microscopy .",
    "the extraction of the charge densities from the coulomb blockade microscopy was considered in a number of papers but uniquely for one - dimensional quantum dots.@xcite we show below , that quasi one - dimensional systems in which the few - electron charge density is rigid , the magnetic field has no pronounced influence on the charge density mapping with the sgm .",
    "this is in contrast to the two - dimensional quantum dots in which the role of the magnetic field is very pronounced .",
    "the study of two - dimensional quantum dots in the absence of the magnetic field was given in our previous paper.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows : section ii explains the model and computational approach ; section iii presents the results for an ideally circular parabolic quantum dot , for the quantum dot perturbed by a presence of a charged defect , as well as for confinement potential of a rectangular shape and flat profile near the minimum .",
    "summary and conclusions are given in section  iv .",
    "the system of @xmath0 electrons is described by the effective - mass hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7  is the position of the @xmath8-th electron and the last term introduces the spin zeeman effect polarizing the ground - state spin @xmath9 at high magnetic field @xmath10 oriented perpendicular to the plane of confinement .",

    "we consider a circular parabolic confinement potentials , @xmath20 with @xmath21 mev .",
    "the second term introduces the perturbation by a negatively charged defect ( ionized donor , or charged acceptor ) at position @xmath22 at a distance from the plane of confinement , with @xmath23 or @xmath24 ( in the absence of the defect ) .",
    "the electrostatic confinement potentials have usually parabolic profiles near the minimum.@xcite however , for the specific gating geometry systems of steeper profiles with flat minima can be produced.@xcite the reaction of the system to the perturbation by the tip potential should naturally be much stronger for flat potentials . the present discussion covers also this type of conditions . for that purpose",
    "we consider a non - parabolic confinement potential of a rectangular profile @xmath25 for strongly elongated rectangular quantum dots ( @xmath26 ) the confinement approach the quasi one - dimensional limit with all the electrons occupying the same state of spatial quantization along the narrow side of the rectangle .",
    "the mapping of the charge density is discussed for parameters @xmath27 nm , @xmath28 nm . we also consider a square shape of the potential ( @xmath29 nm ) for discussion of the relation between the intrinsic symmetry of the lowest - energy spatial configuration of a few electrons and the symmetry of confinement in the context of the external perturbation .",
    "the tip of the scanning gate microscope interacts with the electron system buried beneath the surface of the structure with the electrostatic coulomb potential which is screened by the deformation it induces on the two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "the resulting effective potential of the tip  as obtained by the schrdinger - poisson calculations @xcite  is short range and close to the lorentz function which we use as the model potential in this work @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the position of the tip above the plane of confinement , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the height and width of the lorentzian .",

    "we use up to @xmath41 centers spaced by a distance that is adopted variationally to the size of the quantum dot . for the solution of the few - electron system we use the standard approach of the configuration interaction method forming a basis of the slater determinants of single - electron spin - orbitals with the spatial eigenfunctions of the single - electron hamiltonian @xmath42 and a fixed value of @xmath9 . for convergence of the energy with a precision of @xmath43ev we take up to @xmath44 single - electron spin - orbitals which for @xmath45 electrons produces basis of @xmath46 slater determinants .",
    "the experiments using the coulomb blockade microscopy @xcite scan the surface of the devices inducing the current flow when the chemical potential of the few - electron system ( @xmath47 ) interacting with the probe fits in the transport energy window between the fermi energies of the source and drain . since @xmath48",
