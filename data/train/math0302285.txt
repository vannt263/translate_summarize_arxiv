    "time ago , newborn classical mechanics simply described how the inertial law was disturbed by the action of a force .",
    "one can consider two inertial trajectories from @xmath0 to @xmath1 and then from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , where a change is applied in a point @xmath1 .        if we ask for equal - time segments , then areas @xmath3 and @xmath4 are equal too .",
    "in modern language , we are showing that dynamics of a physical system is given by the rule    @xmath5    by applying this principle to central forces newton was able to introduce time in geometry , mimicking kepler second law .",
    "this is proposition 1 of book i in the principia .",
    "historians tell us that this proposition was rebuilt at least three times while doing the built , and it was already present in the previous paper _",
    "de motu_.    it is very troublesome to define evolution , or consistence within a trajectory , by claiming the equality of two areas , and then asking both areas to go to zero . paraphrasing my colleague e. forgy ( from a different context ) , i believe the old fathers could be asking themselves : is mechanics just a series of @xmath6 statements ?",
    "two close remarks :    - it is known that path integral measure is concentrated in continuous everywhere , differentiable nowhere , trajectories .",
    "this shows how troublesome is to try to approach the classical path . by the way , feynman path integral is about the limit of an equal - time discretization of trajectory , just as newton proposition 1 .",
    "- it s stochastic calculus includes a factor @xmath7 .",
    "it should be interesting , from the point of view of didactics , to look for the geometrical origin of this root .",
    "consider the natural `` elementary school '' groupoid over configuration space :    @xmath8    its algebra of functions has the product    @xmath9    fourier transforming the @xmath10 component we see this product is equivalent to :    @xmath11    which in turn , by changing @xmath12 , corresponds to the product defined in the @xmath13 part of connes s tangent groupoid .",
    "thus the algebra of functions in the latter is a subalgebra of the one of the `` elementary school '' groupoid .",
    "the @xmath14 part of the tangent groupoid is defined using the product @xmath15 of elements of the tangent bundle .",
    "it is well known that continuity of functions in all the groupoid is just a ( de)quantization condition , as @xmath16 defines a product of operators in hilbert space .    by fourier",
    "transform we can see that groupoid algebra in tangent space is pointwise product of functions in cotangent space . and",
    "if we choose a concrete limiting procedure then we can associate a deformed , star product to the functions of the cotangent space . whose star - exponential , fourier transformed again , can be proved to be feynman path integral .",
    "while the law of areas can be used to prove angular momentum preservation , its origin is deeper , and simpler , than our modern noether s theorem .",
    "it comes from the combination of the law of addition of vectors and the first law of newton , and in this way it simply expresses the equality of the projection of velocities in the plane orthogonal to the variation of momentum .",
    "thus , force -or variation of momentum- , which describes a plane , is compulsed to be a covector .",
    "and then we can look for the potential functions whose gradient is the force .",
    "the visualization of the plane associated to the force covector let us to extend the equal - time area law to more arbitrary time steps : now we just ask for inertia law in [ the projection on ] this plane .",
    "noncommutativity is still there , hidden in the definition of variation of momentum just as something with happens `` between '' velocity steps ( whose size does not matter anymore ) .",
    "lets say , when position changes there is not such thing as a change of momentum , and when momentum changes there is not such thing as a change of position .",
    "it could be interesting to review the introduction of a gauge field .",
    "then it is known that the new momentum ( as defined from the lagrangian ) is not anymore the canonical conjugate of position .",
    "but the point is that the new field , at least in the simplest u(1 ) case , generates a force orthogonal to the velocity . in some sense",
    "it is exploiting a hole in the `` projected inertia law '' of the previous paragraph .",
    "one could relate this exploit to the proof of maxwell s [ homogeneous ] laws from that famous -and slippery- report of feynman to dyson .",
    "remember that noncommutativity is needed for the proof .",
    "if we were used to the derivation of the lagrangian ( and the euler - lagrange equations ) in a deductive way from newton dynamics , as historically was done , then neither the groupoid formalism nor feynman path - integral approach should surprise us .",
    "it is very easy to attach a lagrangian action to an element of groupoid and then to formulate the variation mechanism . and",
    "the extremal condition can be shown to be the one of the path integral .",
    "more on this below in the bibliography .",
    "the real quest is the use of these formalisms for fields beyond 0 + 1 .",
    "during a quantization process it always happens that we choose an ordering of operators .",
    "above it was the limiting procedure .",
    "it is equivalent to select one concrete star product .",
    "also , it is known that it corresponds in the path integral formalism to a choosing of what discretization method do we apply to the lagrangian .    the classical limit of course , does not see the discretization nor the ordering .",
    "now , a huge -for the standards of the family- group of theorists like to study the noncommutative differential calculus coming from the rule @xmath17 that approaches the usual calculus when @xmath18 .",
    "the previous formula is a bit formal , and it is usually supplemented by choosing whether the associated difference equations are to be considered with @xmath19 or with @xmath20 . in any case , there is still the same question that in the physical methods : while keeping with the noncommutativity rule , it could be possible to do various combinations of forward and backward derivations or to choose different values of a displacement parameter such that @xmath21 with @xmath22 when @xmath23 .",
    "as other possibility , a doubly twisted differential calculus can be defined via @xmath24 and the standard technologies @xmath25    it is interesting because from the physics side no results are published , as far as i known , beyond @xmath26 , so the q - geometry approach could contain some surprises .",
    "it should be good to be aware that quantum mechanics does not need renormalization , and renormalization is about scale - keeping in a limit process .    and even in the trivial case it can be studied an `` angle '' @xmath27 depending of the position @xmath0 but disappearing in the commutative limit .",
    "it was not the first time newton ran into troubles with the infinitesimal limit . back in 1666",
    "he noticed how his binomial was the key for an algebraic approach to the method of calculation of tangents .",
    "the combination with barrow theorem , giving the inverse operation , was to be enough to dominate analysis during three centuries .",
    "probably barrow got enthusiastic by the discovery , because newton was asked to write a small document , which was showed to collins .",
    "it seems that objections were raised about the method , and newton was convinced to bury it in the coffin of unspeakable resources . at that time barrow influence",
    "he had narrowly escaped death two times while adventuring in foreign lands , trying to rebuild the methods of archimedes , and then returning cambridge to be awarded the ( first ) lucasian chair .",
    "and collins was also remarkable , he was the key editor in the age , even if his own math was not so impressive .",
    "so it is not surprising that newton was refrained of speaking calculus , at least until leibnitz happened to claim the same results .    with time",
    "-and this is a sad history- barrow s star should decline , retired to monastic studies far from math .",
    "he evolved to write collins that their superiors -in his order- had completely `` forbidden '' him to do study in any mathematical research , and it is rumored he eventually overdoped opium until death .",
    "he was not there , then , to discuss with newton about the principia .",
    "the tangent groupoid is defined in connes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ii.5 ) ; its relation with deformed * -products and weyl quantization was insinuated at the end of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* iv.d ) and also in the 1995 sesion of les houches .",
    "it was rigorized in a first wave by cariena _",
    "et al . _ and landsman .",
    "the use of groupoids in mechanics , quantum and classical , has been revised by weinstein @xcite .",
    "in particular the least action principle for groupoids was formulated in @xcite .",
    "dirac original paper shows that one must use feynman formula ; alternatively a derivation based in the @xmath28 distribution is exemplified in @xcite    links between deformed differential calculus and discretization have been claimed by diverse groups during the last decade ; perhaps the deepest work come from a. dimakis , f. mller - hoissen and collaborators . in the math side , the laboratoire emile picard is doing hard work on q - differences . also q - group work , as for instance s. majid , is relevant .",
    "a direct line to stochastic calculus is exposed in @xcite ; also e. forgy had a work published on this , but in wilmott financial bulletin!. a recent account of the ordering problem related to path integrals can be found in @xcite , from where references can be backtracked .",
