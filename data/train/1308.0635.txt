    "the black hole , an exotic astronomical object predicted in general relativity , is playing more and more important roles in various fields of modern physics . showing the existence of such an object by studying",
    "its stability is obviously important .",
    "starting from the influential study by regge and wheeler @xcite , the stability of black holes has been investigated over half a century .",
    "it has been demonstrated that most black holes are stable under various types of perturbations ( for a recent review see for example @xcite ) , which shows that the black hole is realizable in practice and is not just a mathematical curiosity .",
    "recently , aretakis carefully examined the stability of the extreme black holes in the asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "they proved analytically that for the extreme reissner - nordstrm ( ern ) and kerr ( ekerr ) black holes , there exists a classical instability under massless scalar field perturbations @xcite .",
    "this is an amazing result viewed from two aspects .",
    "the first one is that non - extreme rn and kerr black holes are stable against massless scalar field perturbations @xcite , so it is surprising that the stability of black holes changes radically when the extremal limit is approached .",
    "the second one is that extreme black hole occupies an essential place in understanding quantum theory of gravity .",
    "for example , the bekenstein - hawking entropy of extremal supersymmetric black holes can have statistical explanation in string theory @xcite , which reflects a quantum aspect of gravity .",
    "the study on the stability of extreme black holes is obviously important .",
    "aretakis result suggests that the stability of extreme black holes has to be reexamined .",
    "aretakis argument can be briefly summarized as follows .",
    "we work in the ingoing eddington - finkelstein ( ef ) coordinates @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and suppose that the initial data for the perturbation @xmath2 is defined on a spacelike surface intersecting with the future horizon and further , one can construct a certain conserved quantity on the horizon , i.e. , the so - called aretakis constant . with this constant ,",
    "it can be proved analytically that the derivative @xmath3 shall not decay on the horizon . however , the field itself , @xmath2 does decay on the horizon as well as outside .",
    "moreover , all radial derivatives of @xmath2 fall off outside the horizon .",
    "the non - decay of @xmath3 on the horizon leads to a blow up of @xmath4 on the horizon at late times .",
    "aretakis could demonstrate that the derivative @xmath5 blows up at the horizon as @xmath6 or even faster .",
    "this suggests the instability of the extreme black hole .",
    "this proof was extended to other extreme black holes in the asymptotically flat spacetime in various dimensions @xcite .",
    "similar instability was also found in the electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations in the ekerr black hole@xcite .",
    "this type of gravitational instability was also observed for higher dimensional extreme black holes @xcite .",
    "aretakis s analytic argument was recently confirmed in @xcite by a numerical calculation .",
    "they examined the late time behavior of the scalar field in great detail and found that in the asymptotically flat spacetime the mode of the massless scalar perturbations with higher @xmath7 ( where @xmath7 is the spherical harmonic index ) decays faster .",
    "they also discussed the case provided that one can not define the non - zero aretakis constant where aretakis analytical argument breaks down and found that the horizon instability still exists ( see also the recent work @xcite where an analytical argument is given for this case ) .",
    "moreover , they showed that for a massive scalar field as well as for electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations , an instability also develops .    in this paper",
    ", we will extend the study to the extreme reissner - nordstrm ( ern - ads ) black hole .",
    "motivated by the recent discovery of the ads / cft correspondence , the investigation of the stability of ads black holes becomes more appealing .",
    "the stability of the nonextreme ads black holes has been studied extensively , see for example @xcite and references therein . in the nonextreme ads black hole , it was shown that the behavior of perturbations differs a lot from those in the asymptotically flat spacetimes .",
    "for example , the scalar field experiences an exponential decay at late time in the ads black hole background @xcite instead of a power - law decay in the asymptotically flat black holes @xcite . higher @xmath7 modes",
    "will experience an increase of the damping time scale and a decrease of the oscillation time scale compared with the lower @xmath7 modes in the ads black hole @xcite , while the situation is opposite in the asymptotically flat black hole @xcite .",
    "these differences in the behaviors of perturbations are caused by the different effective potentials and boundary conditions in the ads black hole compared with the asymptotically flat black hole .",
    "here we want to examine how the presence of the negative cosmological constant affects the stability of extreme black holes in the ads space .",
    "we will focus on the massless scalar field perturbations . in @xcite ,",
    "it was argued that when the rn - ads black hole approaches to the extremal limit , the late time decay of the scalar field outside the black hole changes from exponential to power - law .",
    "it is interesting to check this result in the exactly extreme rn - ads black hole background both outside the horizon and on the horizon .",
    "we will examine the stability of the extreme rn - ads black hole and compare the result with that in the asymptotically flat black holes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we will follow aretakis argument to study the horizon stability of ern - ads black hole analytically . in section iii",
    ", we will use numerical method to study the behavior of the massless scalar field perturbations for different angular index @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "section iv is devoted to conclusion and discussion . in order to compare with the ern case",
    ", we will set all parameters to be the same as in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will follow aretakis argument @xcite to study the stability of extremal rn - ads black hole under massless scalar perturbations analytically .",
    "the metric of the extremal rn - ads black hole takes the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the degenerate horizon , and @xmath12 is the ads radius related to the cosmological constant @xmath13 by @xmath14 .",
    "the tortoise coordinate is @xmath15.\\label{tortoise}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the ingoing eddington - finkelstein ( ef ) coordinates , the metric becomes @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "the dynamics of the massless scalar perturbation is governed by the klein - gordon equation @xmath18    working in the ef coordinate ( [ metric1 ] ) , we begin by expanding @xmath2 as @xmath19 where the index @xmath20 has been dropped . substituting it into the equation of motion ,",
    "we obtain @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",

    "the constant @xmath26 does not vanish for general initial data , thus remaining non - zero . as a consequence",
    "the field and its radial derivative do not simultaneously tend to zero at the horizon .",
    "later , we show how @xmath2 decays at late times using a numerical computation .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 does not decay at the horizon , @xmath27    now , acting on ( [ scalareom1 ] ) with @xmath28 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we obtain @xmath29_{r = r_+}=0\\quad .\\label{scalareom2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , @xmath30_{r = r_+ } \\rightarrow",

    "thus , in contrast with the ern case @xcite , the above analytic analysis can not be extended to arbitrary @xmath32 .",
    "however , for @xmath32 modes , we can still get some important information by analyzing the asymptotical property of the equation of motion ( [ scalareom1 ] ) at large @xmath0 by supposing that the late - time behavior of @xmath35 on the horizon is about @xmath36 with @xmath37 a negative non - integer constant .",
    "we will prove this assumption and get @xmath37 later using numerical method .",
    "then from ( [ scalareom1 ] ) , at large @xmath0 , we get that @xmath38 . by taking further @xmath1-derivatives of ( [ scalareom1 ] ) , and analyzing the behavior at large @xmath0",
    ", we can obtain @xmath39 this implies that there is always horizon instability for large enough @xmath40 .",
    "in this section , we use a numerical method to analyze the behavior of the massless scalar perturbations along the horizon in the background of the ern - ads black hole . in the analytic analysis",

    "this is equivalent to consider an initial outgoing wavepacket in the perturbation @xcite . besides the outgoing wavepacket",

    "indeed , in case the backreaction pulls the black hole out of the extreme limit , there are two choices , namely either the nonextreme limit is stable , thus backreaction stabilizes the problem , or the quasiextreme case is also unstable , and the whole black hole is unstable . very recently , there appears a work in this direction for the ern case @xcite .",
