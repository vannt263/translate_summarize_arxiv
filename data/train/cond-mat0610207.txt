    "simple models for non - fermi liquids , such as the multi - channel kondo models , have attracted recently much theoretical interest .",
    "the predicted thermodynamic properties as well as transport properties are markedly different from the properties of a fermi liquid . for example",
    "the conductance is predicted to approach its asymptotic zero temperature value as the square root of the temperature .    in this work",
    "we study a system built of a small quantum dot with even number of electrons coupled to a large dot and free leads .",
    "we explore the possibility to observe two channel kondo physics in it by a fine tuning of the magnetic field and the couplings between the small quantum dot , the leads and the large dot .    in the first experimental realization of the _",
    "single channel kondo _ effect in planar quantum dot @xcite transport was measured through a small dot containing odd number of electrons , which may be described by a local spin impurity model . at low temperature",
    "the spin is screened by the conduction electrons ( of the single channel ) , a kondo resonance is formed and the conductance through the dot approaches ( in the symmetric dot case ) to the universal value @xmath0 with a fermi liquid @xmath1 law . soon after the experimental realization of the single channel kondo effect it was understood theoretically that in the presence of magnetic field @xcite a _ single channel kondo _ resonance may be formed in a dot with an even number of electrons .",
    "for example , when there are two electrons in a two - level dot the relevant states are a singlet state @xmath2 with total spin @xmath3 and energy @xmath4 ; and a triplet of states , @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 and energies @xmath8 , ( @xmath9 is the zeeman energy ) . if @xmath10 than the application of magnetic field reduces the energy of the triplet state with @xmath11 until at @xmath12 the states @xmath13 , @xmath14 are degenerate .",
    "the doublet of the degenerate state may be considered as isospin with which the conduction electrons form the kondo state . following these theoretical predictions",
    "the even kondo effect was observed experimentally in vertical dots @xcite and nanotubes@xcite .",
    "it is important to appreciate that although the screening of the spin in both the single - channel kondo effect and the single - channel - even kondo effect is a non trivial many body phenomenon , eventually at low temperature , the spin is fully screened and both effects exhibit conventional fermi liquid behavior .",
    "in contrast , when the dot has a doubly degenerate ground - state and there are two independent channels that equally screen the spin , an over - screening occurs and a non trivial many body two channel kondo effect is formed .",
    "this many body state has both thermodynamic and transport properties that do not follow the predictions of the fermi liquid theory .    the main difficulty in realizing a physical system that materializes the two channel kondo model is in creating two separate channels that equally screen the spin . in conventional setups",
    "an electron from one channel that hops on the dot may hop to the other channel and causes mixing between the channels .",
    "this mixing lead eventually to twoeigen channels \" with one channel coupled stronger than the other one .",
    "the channel with the stronger coupling fully screen the spin and the other channel is decoupled , and we thus have again the single channel kondo case .",
    "it was suggested @xcite to overcome this mixing problem by using a large quantum dot as an additional channel .",
    "then , the free leads form one channel and the large dot forms the second channel ( cf .",
    "fig  [ fg : model ] ) .",
    "the channels do not mix as transfer of electrons between them will charge the large dot .",
    "this suggestion for the realization of the _ two channel kondo effect _ was realized experimentally  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we combine the two channel kondo effect with the even kondo effect",
    ". we will show that it is possible to tune the magnetic field , the coupling strengthes of the small dot to the large dot and to the free leads in such a way that the two channel fixed point is stabilized .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in section [ se : model ] we introduce a model that describes a small dot with even number of electrons connected to a large dot and free reservoirs . in subsections [ subse : symmetry ] and [ subse : projection ]",
    "we introduce a few simplifying assumptions concerning the symmetry of the dot ",
    "lead couplings , and define the appropriate vector operators @xmath15 which describe the effective spin built from the singlet and one of the triplet states in the presence of accidental degeneracy induced by a magnetic field . then in subsection [ subse : sw ] we integrate out the high energy fields using a generalized schrieffer  wolff transformation until we obtain the effective low temperature hamiltonian [ eq .  ( [ eq : hanizo ] ) ] , which in general case demonstrates both channel and exchange anisotropy . as a special case",
    "we consider a situation when the small dot is split to two small dots . in section [ se : rg ] we analyze the flow of the parameters using a renormalization group approach and discuss the conditions to observe the two channel kondo physics .",
    "we find that in spite of the complicated form of hamiltonian ( [ eq : hanizo ] ) , the fixed point for two channel kondo effect may be achieved by fine tuning the setup parameters . in section",
    "[ se : experimental ] we discuss possible experimental realizations and observations of the predictions of the model .",
    "some details of the calculations are relegated to appendices that appear after the summary .",
    "generalizing the idea formulated in ref . , we study a system consisting of a small dot @xmath16 with two discrete energy levels labeled by index @xmath17 coupled with left @xmath18 and right @xmath19 leads and a large dot @xmath20 , by means of tunneling amplitudes @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "( we have assumed here that the coupling constants do not depend on the state indices of the leads and the large dot . )",
    "the key feature of the model is that the dot @xmath20 is sufficiently large so that the single particle mean level spacing @xmath22 in this dot is small enough to make its spectrum quasi continuous , @xmath23 , whereas the coulomb blockade energy @xmath24 is large enough to fix the number of electrons @xmath25 , i.e. to prevent occupation of this dot by extra electron injected from the leads or from the small dot @xmath16 .     with even number of electrons coupled to a large dot @xmath20 and two leads @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "there are two levels in dot @xmath16 .",

    "the eigen energies include not only the strong coulomb blockade but also the zeeman term , which do not influence the electrons in the free lead and the electrons in the large dot as by assumption they have a constant density of states .",
    "the operators @xmath34 are the hubbard operators@xcite ( see appendix [ app : spinalgebra ] ) .      when there is only one level in the dot , it is possible to perform a unitary transformation of the electron creation and annihilation operators in the left and right leads so that only one linear combination is coupled to the small dot , while the other one is decoupled  @xcite . in the generic case",
    "it is not possible to perform such rotation for the multilevel dot.@xcite however , if the tunneling matrix elements do not depend on @xmath36 and @xmath37 we can define : @xmath38 \\nonumber \\\\ a_{\\phi k \\sigma } = e^{i \\varphi } \\left [          -   \\sin\\theta a_{rk\\sigma } + \\cos\\theta a_{lk\\sigma}\\right]% \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which diagonalize the left - right sector of the hamiltonian . to obtain @xmath39 in terms of @xmath40 and @xmath41 we simply have to substitute in eq .",

    ", we first assume that the strong coulomb energy @xmath26 fixes the number of electrons in the small dot to be even ( say @xmath47 ) .",
    "when the single particle level spacing in the small @xmath16-dot , denoted by @xmath22 , obey the inequality @xmath48 , we may further assume that only two single particle levels @xmath49 in @xmath50 are involved in the tunneling .",
    "so one can model the small dot @xmath16 by a two - level dot with two electrons .",
    "we denote the single particle levels of the dot by @xmath51 and @xmath52 and assume that @xmath53 .",
    "there are six possible states in this system , but we will neglect for simplicity the possibility of double occupation of level 2 and the singlet state of electrons occupying different levels .",
    "we thus remain with a subset of four lowest states : a spin singlet state , @xmath54 , with energy @xmath4 when two electrons occupy level 1 ; and a spin triplet , @xmath55 , with energy @xmath56 , when one electron occupy level 1 and the other level 2 .    in terms of the creation operators with @xmath57 of electrons with spin @xmath58 at levels 1 and 2 respectively , the singlet state is given by @xmath59 and the three triplet components by @xmath60    the two - electron levels @xmath61 are the eigenvalues of hamiltonian @xmath62 truncated in the way described above : @xmath63 we further assume that the exchange splitting @xmath64 obeys the equation @xmath65 . in this case",
    "the singlet has a lower energy in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "next , in accordance with the standard approach @xcite , we neglect the finite level spacing @xmath66 in the large dot @xmath20 , but suppose that the coulomb blockade @xmath24 fixes the number of electrons , @xmath25 , in the large dot .",
    "the interval @xmath66 denotes the lower limit of the energy of electron - hole excitation in dot @xmath20 .",
    "the kondo tunneling regime is ineffective in our system unless @xmath67 .",
    "this is a special situation , which may be achieved in some cases by tuning the gate voltage or playing with diamagnetic shift.@xcite we study here a general case of singlet ground state and appeal to the mechanism of accidental degeneracy induced by an in - plane external magnetic field @xmath68 , which occurs when the zeeman effect compensates the singlet ",
    "triplet splitting .",
    "@xcite this mechanism is illustrated in fig .",

    "the degeneracy between the states @xmath69 and @xmath4 occurs when the condition @xmath70 is satisfied . here",
    "@xmath71 is the zeeman splitting energy .",
    "to find out the possibility of a kondo effect induced by an external magnetic field , one should derive the effective spin hamiltonian containing relevant variables .",
    "various procedures for the description of this phenomenon were discussed in refs .  .",
    "we will use the formalism of dynamical symmetry group , offered and elaborated in refs .  .",
    "according to this approach briefly described in appendix  [ app : spinalgebra ] , the spin degrees of freedom in case of accidental degeneracy of the states @xmath72 and @xmath73 are described by the vector @xmath74 with components @xmath75    the operator @xmath74 obeys conventional commutation relations of momentum operator .",
    "it can be treated as an effective spin operator describing transversal and longitudinal spin excitations in a quantum dot occupied by two electrons under condition of accidental degeneracy illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fg : ad ] .",
    "we therefore may introduce an effective spin operator whose creation and annihilation operators with components @xmath76 are denoted , respectively , by @xmath77 .      to obtain the effective low energy hamiltonian one has to integrate in the renormalization group sense the states with high energy .",
    "there are few energy scales here : the charging energy of the small dot , @xmath26 , the charging energy of the large dot @xmath24 and the precise position of the many body levels in the dot .",
    "we will assume that this integration have renormalized the original parameters of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) and will concentrate on a situation when only the state @xmath14 and @xmath78 and single - electron states of the dot are relevant for virtual hopping between @xmath16 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we will also assume that the scale of the energy considered is smaller than @xmath24 so that transition between @xmath18 and @xmath19 to @xmath20 ( via @xmath16 ) are excluded .",
    "after concentrating on the two states of the dot we are in a position to perform the schrieffer - wolff @xcite transformation .",
    "the schrieffer - wolff transformation leads to terms of the form : @xmath79 in the general case @xmath80 is a tensor of rank @xmath81 . however , due to the symmetry assumption  ( [ eq : t - symmetry ] ) it reduces to a rank 4 tensor .",
    "for example the term @xmath82 describes a virtual transition from the triplet state to the large dot @xmath20 and back .",
    "this transition occurs when an electron hops from the large dot @xmath20 on the small dot @xmath16 and back , or when one of the electrons that build the triplet state of dot @xmath16 hops on dot @xmath20 and back .",
    "according to our previous assumptions the former process is negligible and there are two contributions to the latter process . in the first an electron from level 1",
    "hop on dot @xmath20 and back and in the second electron from level 2 hop on dot @xmath20 and back .",
    "similar processes should be taken into account for  @xmath83 .",
    "we have therefore :    @xmath84    here the exchange integral is estimated for the intermediate state with the electron escaped from the dot @xmath16 to the fermi level which is supposed to be the same for the leads and the dot @xmath20 , @xmath85 .",

    "the flow diagram @xmath129 for this system has a weak coupling fixed point , which is unstable against channel anisotropy .",
    "the system ( [ scal3 ] ) is written for the case of @xmath130 .",
    "it is known that the external magnetic field is a relevant parameter for the conventional two - channel kondo effect.@xcite in our case the two - channel regime arises only at certain magnetic field @xmath131 ( fig .",
    "[ fg : ad ] ) and , similar to the effect of an external magnetic field in conventional two channel kondo system , the deviation @xmath132 from this critical value is detrimental for the two - channel physics .",
    "the system of flow equations for the anisotropic hamiltonian ( [ eq : hanizo ] ) with dimensionless coupling constants @xmath133 is more complicated . in this case",
    "the third - order corrections in the r.h.s . of scaling equations contains the sums @xmath134 , where @xmath135 are the channel indices and the indices @xmath136 mark the cartesian components @xmath137 in spin space . besides , additional scaling equations should be written for the integrals @xmath138 .",
    "it is easily seen that the vertices @xmath139 remain unrenormalized in 2-nd order , and the third - order corrections enter with plus sign in the r.h.s . of corresponding scaling equations .",
    "thus , the parameters @xmath140 scale into zero . as to the anisotropic third order terms in scaling equations for @xmath141 , it is known from predictions of conformal field theory @xcite , that the exchange anisotropy is irrelevant for two - channel regime .",
    "so we conclude that the flow diagram for the two - channel hamiltonian ( [ eq : hanizo ] ) with anisotropic exchange coupling retains the finite isotropic fixed point and only the channel anisotropy is relevant .",
    "the even charge kondo effect can be realized experimentally in a setup similar to the one that was suggested to the odd two - channel kondo effect @xcite . in the ordinary setup (",
    "that was realized recently experimentally @xcite ) two noninteracting leads ( l and r ) and a large dot c are attached to a single - level small dot d. in the setup considered here we need more then one level on the small dot and require also to fulfil certain relations between the coupling constants  ( [ eq : t - symmetry ] ) .",
    "in addition , even when these symmetries are fulfilled , we still need to tune the magnetic field to be at a degeneracy point between the singlet and the triplet , and fine tune the dot - channel coupling so that @xmath142 . in practice",
    "this would be rather complected as many parameters should be tuned .    in a setup with two - valley double dot shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : expsetup ] only one tunnel constant enters all exchange integrals . in this case",
    "the two - level dot @xmath16 is formed by two single particle dots .",
    "two dot levels @xmath113 are given by eq .",
    "( [ ddot ] ) and the single particle states of the small dot @xmath16 are the symmetric and antisymmetric wave functions of single dots . as a result the coupling constants to the two levels are equal and the ratio ( [ eq : t - symmetry ] ) is fulfilled authomatically . this condition facilitates the fine tuning procedure .      in order to identify the even channel kondo effect one has first to identify the kondo case when the finite reservoir @xmath20 is open .",
    "this can be found by tuning the magnetic field , and the levels of the small dot so that @xmath143",
    ". next when dot @xmath20 is formed and tunneling of electrons between @xmath18 and @xmath19 to @xmath20 is forbidden , one has to tune the coupling constants so that @xmath144",
    ".    we will assume in the following the the coupling to lead @xmath18 is much bigger than the coupling to lead @xmath19 .",
    "then as in the regular two channel kondo effect @xcite we expect that when @xmath145 differential conductance between the left and right leads @xmath146 ( with @xmath147 the voltage and @xmath148 the temperature ) will follow the 2ck scaling law @xcite : @xmath149 with @xmath150 and the scaling function @xmath151 is given in appendix [ app : y ] .    while @xmath152 , the scaling law is : @xmath153 with @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "unlike the single channel case , the magnetic field is a relevant parameter in the two channel case .",
    "we expect that the effective magnetic field in the even two channel kondo case will operate in a way very similar to the operation of the ordinary magnetic field in the two channel kondo case @xcite .",
    "notice though that the effective magnetic field @xmath156 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : be ] ) ] is controlled by the real external magnetic field , by the position of the two levels and by the coupling constants .",

    "we studied the possibility to observe the two channel kondo effect in multiple dots hetero - structures with even occupation in the presence of magnetic field . like in case of single channel kondo tunneling @xcite , we have found that magnetic field , which is as a rule detrimental for odd occupation kondo regime , may induce the two - channel kondo effect provided the zeeman splitting compensates the exchange gap between singlet ground state and the state with spin projection oriented parallel to magnetic field .",
    "the effective spin of the small quantum dot in this case is 1/2 despite of the even occupation , so that the two channels provided by the large dot and the leads are sufficient to overscreen the dot spin .",
    "the exchange anisotropy which arises in presence of magnetic field disappears because of additional degeneracy in case when the small dot is split into two identical wells ( fig .",
    "[ fg : expsetup ] ) .",
    "the two channel kondo quantum critical physics may be stabilized by fine tuning of the parameters ( i.e. coupling constants and external magnetic field ) .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussion with eran sela , ileana rau and david goldhaber - gordon . the research was supported by dip , isf and bsf foundations .",
    "in case of strong coulomb blockade , the low - energy part of the spectrum of complex quantum dots with even occupation consists of a system of singlet / triplet pairs ( in the absence of the orbital symmetry , which may impose the hund scheme of level occupation ) .",
