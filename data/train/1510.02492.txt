    "the degree of asymmetry appears to increase as the photosphere recedes into the deeper layers of the ejecta .",
    "the type iip sn 2004dj showed a dramatic increase in the continuum polarisation as the photosphere receded through the hydrogen layer into the core , unambiguously signalling that the explosion mechanism itself was inherently asymmetric and previously shielded from view by the hydrogen envelope at earlier times @xcite .",

    "this suggests that the ejecta , while apparently still following a principal axis of symmetry , develop a degree clumpiness at later times . at @xmath36 days , the line polarisation of the lv and hv component share similar polarisation angles consistent with a single axial symmetry , with no evidence of clumpiness within the ejecta .",
    "the implication is that between @xmath19 and @xmath125 days the ejecta became clumpy , most likely due to hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "such instabilities could propagate through the ejecta @xcite or may develop from remnant asphericities in the explosion mechanism itself , such as the standing accretion shock instability @xcite or through the propagation of a jet - like flow through the progenitor star ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite for discussion of jet - induced hydrodynamical instabilities in snr cas a and @xcite for simulations of instabilities in supernova explosions ) .",
    "there are no previous observations of two geometrically and physically distinct hei line forming regions in the ejecta of type ib sne .",
    "the properties of both the hv and lv components for iptf 13bvn are different from those observed for other stripped ccsne .",
    "it is possible that the scarcity of previous polarimetric observations or viewing angle effects may have meant that this feature has been missed in the other sne .",
    "if these features are truly unique to iptf 13bvn , signs of the sn s peculiarity may be expected in the light curve or spectra .",
    "iptf 13bvn was classified as a type ib sne , with similarities to sn2009jf , while the light curve was observed to be fast declining and of low luminosity @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the observations of the two hei components are related to the plateau in the evolution of the hei velocity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : minabsvel ] ) .",
    "a similar plateau is also observed in sn 2008d ( see * ? ? ? * and their figure 13 ) , however the polarised hv and lv components in caii and hei observed in iptf 13bvn are not seen in sn 2008d @xcite . only increasing the sample of type ib sne with high polarimetric coverage",
    "can resolve the question of whether this complex ejecta morphology is common to all type ib sne or only a subset , and what role the explosion mechanism plays in the formation of these multiple components .",
    "the velocity at the absorption minimum of the hei / naid blend is observed to decay steeply before plateauing at around maximum light ( see figure [ fig : minabsvel ] ) .",
    "the velocities measured for the hei @xmath111 lines also appear to plateau at the same time ( see * ? ? ? * and their figure 6 ) .",
    "the plateau in the hei velocity may arise from non - thermal excitation , from the direct deposition of gamma rays from the radioactive decay of @xmath112ni and @xmath112co , at velocities higher than the photospheric velocity @xcite .",
    "the geometry of hei may , therefore , serve to trace the geometry of the radioactive nickel .",
    "the coincident emergence of the hv and lv components in the polarimetry with the beginning of the he velocity plateau at @xmath2 maximum light suggests that the non - thermal excitation of the hei lines also powers those components .    in principle",
    ", the collision of an approximately spherical ejecta with an aspherical circumstellar medium ( csm ) could also produce the observed early evolution in the polarimetry .",
    "if interaction were the dominant source of non - thermal excitation , we might expect to also see narrow emission lines in the spectrum , which are not seen in our observations of iptf 13bvn .",
    "furthermore , the collision of ejecta and a csm would result in an injection of energy , identifiable in the light curve as a decline that is slower than expected from radioactive decay .",
    "@xcite note , however , that iptf 13bvn has a faster decline than most type ib / c sne and faster than expected for the decay of @xmath112co .",
    "this suggests a deficiency of energy in the ejecta due to incomplete trapping of gamma rays as opposed to energy from interaction with the csm .",
    "the observations , therefore , disfavour interaction as the source of the separate components and the hei velocity plateau and are , instead , consistent with @xmath112ni located above the photosphere at and after the light curve maximum . the photospheric velocity measured at @xmath113 days post - explosion reveals that nickel must be mixed out to @xmath250 - 65% of the ejecta , by radius , at @xmath28700 @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite performed one dimensional hydrodynamical explosion models of iptf 13bvn which required @xmath112ni to be mixed out to @xmath296% of the initial mass of the progenitor to reproduce the observed rise time of the light curve .",
    "the discrepancy between these two estimates for the degree of ni mixing most likely arise in the application of a 1d model assuming spherical symmetry to , as we have observed , an asymmetrical situation .",
    "if the polarisation of the hv and lv hei components at @xmath17 and @xmath19 days trace the 2d projected distribution of nickel , this implies that not only is it not spherically distributed , covering only a portion of the photosphere , but also that it is distributed in at least two ( if not more ) outflows originating from the core .",
    "our observations have demonstrated the importance of spectropolarimetry for measuring how ni is mixed into the outer layers of the sn ejecta and the degree of this mixing .",
    "this has important implications for how photometric and spectroscopic observations are interpreted , especially in the context of 1d models .      the absence of any strong oi lines in the spectrum until @xmath125 days indicates that the core is still shielded by the photosphere until that epoch .",
    "the presence and polarisation of he i , at @xmath2 maximum light , indicates the role of non - thermal excitation from ni deposited above the core by an axisymmetric outflow that stalled in the helium mantle .",
    "the approximate alignment of the continuum polarisation angle in the later epochs ( @xmath27 and @xmath66 days ) with that of the hv component suggests that there is a principal axis of symmetry for the explosion which may lend itself to the interpretation of a bipolar or jet driven explosion . in this model a jet , originating either from asymmetric neutrino emission @xcite or the magneto - rotational mechanism @xcite , would carry heavy elements in bipolar flows , while low and intermediate mass elements ( e.g. helium and oxygen ) would form a torus in the equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "we observed no such segregation between the locations of heavier mass ( iron and calcium ) and lower mass ( helium and oxygen ) elements in the ejecta , that would suggest such a geometric configuration for iptf 13bvn .",
    "the presence of a separate lv component of hei , which must also arise from non - thermal excitation , also implies that the distribution of nickel can not be described by just a simple bipolar geometry .    in comparison with the velocity of the hv he component ( @xmath318700 @xmath10 ) which we use as a tracer for the ni distribution , the high velocities ( @xmath3113,000 @xmath10 )",
    "measured for feii lines at early times implies these features arise from primordial iron already present in the envelope of the progenitor .",
    "likewise , the low velocity inferred for the ni makes it improbable that the caiiir3 hv component traces a fast moving jet .",
    "the deposition of nickel outside of the photosphere , at @xmath2 maximum light , would lead to significant losses of gamma ray photons , which would otherwise be trapped in the ejecta under the photosphere .",
    "this could explain the low luminosity and fast light curve decline of iptf 13bvn @xcite , and may also imply that the nickel mass derived from the bolometric light curve ( 0.05 - 0.1m@xmath14 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may underestimate the true value .",
    "previously , the action of bipolar flows has been inferred from spectropolarimetry of other ccsne .",
    "@xcite observed hv ca in the type ic sn 2007gr , which they proposed was formed in a bipolar outflow , with oxygen distributed in a torus in the equatorial plane .",
    "polarisation in the wavelength region around the caiiir3 in the type ic sn 2002ap was interpreted by @xcite as indicating the presence of a relativistic jet ( 0.115@xmath114 ) that had punched through the ejecta .",
    "later @xcite presented 3 epochs of spectropolarimetry of sn 2002ap and challenged this interpretation , suggesting the polarisation was associated with oxygen at much lower velocities and suggested the data were consistent with a bipolar jet - like flow that had stalled in the core .",
    "similarly , @xcite invoked a thermal energy dominated jet - like flow , that had stopped within the core , to explain the orthogonality between the polarisation angle of hv caii with the angles of helium and iron at lower velocities in the type ib sn 2008d .",
    "@xcite also favoured a jet , that stopped above the core in the helium mantle , for the type ib / c sn 2005bf .",
    "@xcite also favour plumes of radioactive nickel to explain the polarisation of the type iib sn 2011dh .",
    "@xcite and @xcite predicted that , as the photosphere recedes through the deeper layers , later observations of type ibc sne would reveal evidence of an asymmetric flow originating from the explosion .",
    "our multi - epoch spectropolarimetry of iptf 13bvn has confirmed these predictions .",
    "although there are differences between iptf 13bvn and these other type ibc sne , overall a consistent picture of the geometry of these events is emerging .",
    "the geometrical properties inferred here are reminiscent of the complex morphology of the galactic type iib sn remnant cas a. the presence of the opposing north east `` jet '' and south west `` counter - jet '' are indicative of axisymmetric bipolar flows associated with the explosion , similar to that inferred here for the observations at later epochs .",
    "several authors agree , however , that these so - called `` jets '' are secondary features , perhaps arising due to instabilities @xcite , accretion onto a neutron star @xcite or due to precession of the axis of rotation when the bipolar flows were launched @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite conclude that while the observed jets are unlikely to be the result of a jet - induced explosion they are intrinsic to the explosion .",
    "@xcite proposed a model in which the jet - induced explosion launched products from explosive nucleosynthesis in a jet in the south east direction , not along the ne / sw axis . @xcite and",
    "@xcite interpreted the presence of several large ejecta rings surrounding iron rich ejecta to be due to the non - axisymmetric deposition of nickel in clumps in the explosion and such a scenario has also been proposed for sn 1987a @xcite .",
    "the inference of two outflows of nickel and additional `` clumps '' or  bubbles \" of nickel in iptf 13bvn may therefore have very real analogues in resolved sn remnants like cas a @xcite .",
    "the possible identification of a progenitor candidate for iptf 13bvn , as reviewed in section [ sec : intro ] , has generated debate over the progenitor system that gave rise to this sn . for iptf 13bvn ,",
    "we have identified 3 main axes of symmetry over the period covered by our spectropolarimetric observations corresponding to : the hv component at @xmath19 days and the line and continuum polarisation in the later epochs at @xmath2135@xmath25 ; the lv component at + 9 days at @xmath225@xmath25 degrees ; and the alignment of the line polarisation angles of multiple species at the earliest epoch of @xmath010 days at @xmath275@xmath25 .",
    "the asymmetries in the earlier epochs reflect the shape of the the outer most layers of the ejecta . the difference in the polarisation angles observed at @xmath010 days and those at later epochs ( @xmath125 and @xmath136 days ) suggests that the outer layers of the ejecta did not share the same geometry as the explosion .",
    "this suggests , similarly to what has been observed for type iip sne arising red supergiant progenitors @xcite , that the envelope of the pre - supernova star must have been sufficiently large in order to conceal the inner explosion asymmetries for 18 days ( until 0 days when evidence of the inner explosion geometry began to emerge ) .    in the context of understanding the origin of the geometry of the outermost ejecta , the identification of the polarised absorption feature at @xmath26200 @xmath22becomes especially interesting .",
    "the feature is significantly polarised in the first two epochs only ( @xmath010 and 0 days ) before both the degree of polarisation and absorption depth decrease .",
    "as has been suggested for other type ib sne @xcite , if this features is h@xmath115 at @xmath016,400 @xmath10 , this would imply that the h line - forming region lies in the outermost layers of the ejecta .",
    "the polarisation of this feature may then reflect asymmetries in the outermost layers of the progenitor or the progenitor s wind swept up by the ejecta .",
    "the shape of the outer layers of the sn ejecta is also subject to the geometry of the shock break out , which is dependent upon the geometry of the explosion and dynamics of the interaction of the shock front as it propagates through the progenitor star .",
    "the post - maximum polarisation properties indicate that the explosion of iptf 13bvn was highly asymmetric .",
    "@xcite performed calculations which showed that the resulting shock front of an aspherical explosion may emerge at an oblique angle to the stellar surface .",
    "a key prediction of these models is this would induce large asphericities in the highest velocity material and hence significant polarisation . at later times the polarisations angles",
    "are then predicted to rotate , as the geometry becomes progressively dominated by the shape of the explosion mechanism , as we have observed for iptf 13bvn .",
    "the emergence of the explosion geometry at @xmath29 days ( 18 days post - explosion ) implies the progenitor of iptf 13bvn must have had a relatively extended envelope , which argues against oblique shock break out as the source of the early polarisation that @xcite determined is more easily produced by compact progenitors , such as wr stars .",
    "the early polarisation may also arise in a distorted stellar envelope .",
    "tidal distortion of the progenitor star as a result of binary interaction has been discussed as the source of the observed polarisation in sn 1993j and recently in sn 2011dh by @xcite . @xcite and @xcite observed high levels of continuum polarisation in sn 1993j , of @xmath711 - 2% which exhibited no strong temporal dependence .",
    "@xcite found that this could be produced by an oblate model with an axis ratio of 0.6 , while @xcite and @xcite argued that the lack of strong temporal change in the polarisation was an indication that the asymmetry was not intrinsic to the explosion but due to a distorted envelope .",
    "the strong asphericity was linked to a pre - sn common envelope phase in a close binary system @xcite .",
    "similar polarisation properties were observed for sn 1996cb @xcite and sn 2001ig @xcite , with @xcite suggesting that they were the result of a similar binary progenitor system .",
    "the alignment of the caiiir3 , feii and siii polarisation angles and the non - zero degree of continuum polarisation ( @xmath20.2 - 0.7% depending on the chosen isp ) suggests that the envelope was distorted in an axisymmetric manner",
    ". the effect of the tidal distortion of the progenitor on the early - time polarisation of the sn may be amplified by how the explosive shock is able to propagate through the distorted star .",
    "fast rotation or tidal interaction with a binary companion leads to a density profile in the progenitor that is steeper along the direction of the poles .",
    "@xcite showed that a spherical shock front would take on a prolate shape upon encountering the steeper density gradient along the poles . for a massive",
    ", differentially rotating star ( like the progenitor of sn 1987a ) , @xcite found that at @xmath116 days post explosion the photosphere receded through the oblate ejecta to the prolate regions , producing a rotation of the polarisation angles .",
    "the observations of iptf 13bvn are also roughly consistent with this model",
    ".    spectropolarimetric surveys of galactic and large magellenic cloud ( lmc ) wolf - rayet stars show that the majority ( @xmath280% ) are slow rotating spherically symmetric stars @xcite . based on geometry alone ,",
    "the progenitor of iptf 13bvn is unlikely to have been a slowly rotating wr star . @xcite and @xcite discovered that a subset of wr stars that were rotating sufficiently fast to result in a flattened wind were also associated with ejecta nebulae , such that they concluded that these had to be young wr stars ( having recently been through a luminous blue variable or red supergiant phase ) . in low metallicity environments",
    "the line - driven winds of these fast rotators will be too weak to remove significant amounts of angular momentum @xcite , such that they would retain any rotational induced asymmetries up to the point of explosion .",
    "@xcite proposed that this effect was at most limited to metallicities below that of the lmc .",
    "@xcite measured the metallicity of the region of iptf 13bvn as being slightly subsolar , which would suggest as wr star in this region would not be expected to explode as a distorted , fast rotator .",
    "in summary , our polarimetric observations favour an extended , distorted progenitor ( possibly with residual h in the outer layers ) rather than a compact wr star .",
    "we find iptf 13bvn to have exhibited significant continuum and line polarisation in observations covering the period from @xmath010 to @xmath136 days , with respect to the _ r_-band light curve maximum .",
    "the continuum was intrinsically polarised at the 0.2 - 0.4% level throughout the observations , implying asphericities of @xmath210% in the shape of the photosphere .",
    "the degree and angle of continuum polarisation was found to be dependent on the choice of the isp .",
    "significant polarisation was found to be associated with the absorption profiles of spectral lines of caiiir3 , hei / naid , hei@xmath3 , feii@xmath4 , siii@xmath7 and oi@xmath5 .",
    "the caiiir3absorption showed the strongest degree of polarisation of @xmath23% at @xmath125 days .",
    "the polarisations of the hei / naidand feii reached maximum levels of @xmath21% , followed by oi and siii at @xmath20.6% .",
    "we propose that the observation of two loops on the @xmath23-@xmath24 plane associated with the hei / naid profile at @xmath17 and @xmath19 days indicates the presence of at least two physically distinct components to the ejecta .",
    "the formation of separate loops due to the blending of naid with hei was considered unlikely due to the sharp discontinuity observed in the polarisation angle across the profile and the lack of evidence of a strong contribution to the blend from naid at @xmath17 and @xmath19 days .",
    "both loops are attributed to hei .",
    "similarly , caii also show a `` step - function''-like trend in the evolution of the polarisation angle with velocity , supporting the interpretation of at least two distinct line forming regions for hei and caii in the ejecta .",
    "the lv components of caii and hei were found to share the same polarisation angle implying a shared line forming region for the two ions .",
    "the hv components were observed with polarisation angles separated by @xmath240@xmath25 .",
    "the simultaneous emergence of the hv and lv components in the polarisation data with the onset of the he velocity plateau indicated the presence of non - thermal excitation .",
    "the polarisation of the hv and lv hei components was used to trace the 2d projected distribution of nickel in the ejecta , and suggests the presence of at least two outflows originating from the core .",
    "we are able to constrain the bulk of nickel to lie interior to @xmath250 - 65% of the ejecta radius , at a velocity of @xmath1098700 @xmath10 .",
    "this is in disagreement with the prediction from 1d hydrodynamical models , requiring mixing out to @xmath296% of the initial mass of the progenitor to reproduce the observed rise time of the light curve .",
    "the approximate alignment of the continuum polarisation angle in the later epochs with that of the hv component suggests that there was a main axis of symmetry in the explosion , which could be consistent with a bipolar or jet - driven explosion .",
    "the high quality of our data reveal , however , that the structure of the ejecta is not just described by a simple , single axial symmetry and that the morphology of the explosion is much more complicated .",
    "other outflows , originating from the explosion , appear to have been launched in multiple directions but , similarly to other type ib sne , stalled in the he mantle of the progenitor star .",
    "the structure of the outer layers of the ejecta are consistent with a rotationally supported , non - wr star that had retained a thin shell of h at the time of explosion .",
