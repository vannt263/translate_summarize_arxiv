    "the geodesic motion of test particles in a black hole background is one of the most interesting subjects in general relativity .",
    "many astronomical phenomena are related with the geodesic , such as light deflection , perihelion shift of planets , shapiro effect , lense - thirring , black hole shadow and so on . in the near future ,",
    "the ligo @xcite , the event horizon telescope @xcite , and other experiments @xcite may have a qualitatively new level of precision to explore phenomena near the black hole horizon .",
    "the kerr - newman ( kn ) black hole solution describes the gravitational field of a charged and rotating stationary black hole .",
    "although it is not very likely that the astrophysical black hole candidates carry a net charge @xcite , such charged black holes can be formed through a charged stellar collapse @xcite , brane - world - inspired charge - leaking mechanism @xcite , and accretion scenarios @xcite .",
    "the geodesic motion in this black hole background has been extensively investigated . for examples , the timelike equatorial and spherical orbits of uncharged particles and",
    "the last stable orbit of charged particles were studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "the motion of charged particles was also investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the off - equatorial circular orbits were given in ref .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of the photon orbit and charged particle motion in a kn black hole were presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . with the help of the multivariable hypergeometric functions of appell - lauricella and weierstrass elliptic functions ,",
    "the null geodesics of kn black hole are solved in a close form @xcite .",
    "another theoretical interest for the kn black hole is the kn / cfts ( conformal field theory ) dualities @xcite , which are the simple extension of the kerr / cft duality @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that the near - horizon geometry of a near extremal kn black hole has a warped @xmath0 structure , and analytical results for the pair production were also obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .    very recently ,",
    "porfyriadis , shi , and strominger @xcite considered the photon emission near extreme kerr black holes . and they first solved the near - superradiant geodesics analytically .",
    "such results are hoped to apply to a variety of problems related to the observations of electromagnetic radiation . in this paper",
    ", we would like to generalize the result to the extremal kn black hole spacetime .",
    "first , we analyze the effective potential of the radial motion .",
    "we find a critical point , beyond which the photon emitting near the black hole horizon can escape the black hole and can be observed by distant observatories .",
    "then near this critical point , we perform the geodesic integrals for both near and far regions .",
    "finally , matching the solutions in the two regions , we obtain the analytic result for the extremal kn black hole . using the result , observations in a kn spacetime",
    "are expected to be analytically researched .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we would like to give a brief review of the geodesic equations in the kn black hole background and analyze the effective potential . in sec .",
    "[ rth ] the null geodesic motion in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane is analytically solved . and",
    "[ rtrphi ] , we deal with the motions in the @xmath1-@xmath3 and @xmath1-@xmath4 planes . at",
    "last , the paper ends with a brief summary .",
    "in this section , we would like to consider the geodesic equations in the background of a kn black hole .",
    "the line element of a kn black hole in boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath5 is read as @xmath6 where the metric functions are @xmath7 the vector potential is given by @xmath8 the parameter @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the angular momentum , charge , and mass of the black hole .",
    "this black hole solution originates from the four - dimensional einstein - maxwell action @xmath12 the horizons are given by solving the equation @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 the extremal black hole is achieved when the two horizons coincide with each other .",
    "the motion of a charged particle with charge @xmath15 moving in the kn black hole background is described by the lagrangian @xmath16 where a dot over a symbol represents the ordinary differentiation with respect to an affine parameter @xmath17 .",
    "the affine parameter is related to the proper time by @xmath18 , which is equivalent to the normalization condition @xmath19 .",
    "the equation of motion of the charged particle will be @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the electromagnetic tensor and christoffel symbols for the kn black hole .",
    "the equation of motion will reduce to @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 for a particle without charge , the equation of motion can be expressed as @xmath25 when the black hole charge @xmath26 , the result for the kerr black hole will be recovered .",
    "next , we will consider the null geodesics in an extremal kn black hole background , i.e. , @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the dimensionless black hole charge , and we require @xmath29 .",
    "we can reexpress eq .",
    "( [ rmothion ] ) in a classical form @xmath30 with the effective potential @xmath31 . for a classical motion , we require @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "the turning point occurs at @xmath34 or @xmath35 , at which the test particle has a zero radial velocity .",
    "we plot the effective potential @xmath36 against @xmath37 in fig.[rhat1 ] by taking @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40=3 as an example . for this case",
    ", the effective potential has two zero points at @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the peak of the potential is at @xmath43 .",
    "note that the horizon locates at @xmath44 .",
    "for the photons coming from far region , they will stop at the point @xmath45 and be reflected to infinity . and",
    "the photons emitted near the black hole horizon will be reflected at the point @xmath46 , and be absorbed by the black hole . while the region @xmath47 is forbidden for such photons with such @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "there exists a special case that the two zeroes @xmath46 and @xmath45 meet each other and the peak of the potential shift to the horizon , which gives a special bound .",
    "if the parameters of null geodesics is beyond this bound , photons can freely move in the spacetime . in this paper",
    ", we will consider these trajectories near such bound in a kn black hole background .",
    "moreover , such bound can be obtained by solving @xmath50 .",
    "we define as did in ref .",
    "@xcite a small dimensionless parameter @xmath51 this result will recover the superradiant bound for the kerr black hole with @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath53 , the photons emitted near the black hole horizon could not approach infinity .",
    "and @xmath54 is a special point in the parameter space of extremal kn black hole geodesics , at which the photons can escape the black hole . as did for the kerr black hole @xcite ,",
    "the geodesics for the photons with small @xmath17 emitted from the near - horizon region are analytically solvable .",
    "let us introduce the dimensionless bardeen - horowitz coordinates , @xmath55 after this coordinate transformation , the extremal black hole horizon is shifted to @xmath56 . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy @xmath57 can be scaled out of the null geodesic with the shifted dimensionless carter constant @xmath58 here we are interested in the photon trajectories starting at @xmath59 near the horizon and ending at @xmath60 , where a distant telescope locates",
    ". then the geodesic equation can be expressed in terms of the new coordinates ( [ newcoordinate ] ) as @xmath61 where @xmath62 the integrals of ( [ rtheta])-([tftn ] ) can be expressed with elliptic functions and are treated numerically ( for detail see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however ,",
    "in this paper , we will follow the technique of ref .",
    "@xcite to analytically perform the integrals to the leading order in the small parameter @xmath17 with the matched asymptotic expansions ( mae ) method .",
    "the spacetime is divided into different regions @xcite : @xmath63 next , we will fist solve these equations in the near and far regions , respectively , and then match them in the overlap region .",
    "in this section , we deal with the radial integral @xmath64 taking the mae approximation , we have @xmath65 in the near and far regions , one has @xmath66 it is clear that the black hole charge only influences the geodesics in the near region . in the far region ,",
    "the turning points in the radial motion occurs at @xmath67 this result is the same as that of the extremal kerr black hole . in order to require",
    "the photon can penetrate the near region from the far one , there must be no turning point , and thus we take @xmath68 . in the near region ,",
    "the turning points are at @xmath69 for @xmath70 , there will be no turning point in the near region .",
    "thus the photon can freely move from the near region to the far one .",
    "now we can perform the radial integrals both in the near and far regions , @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 the integration constants . in the overlap region ,",
    "the radial integrals are @xmath74 taking the match in the overlap region , i.e. , @xmath75 , we have @xmath76 this condition is the same as that of the kerr black hole given in ref . @xcite . using it ,",
    "we are allowed to calculate the integral ( [ rmotion ] ) for the photon starting from the near region to the far one . moreover ,",
    "if the photon is limited in the equatorial plane @xmath77 or @xmath78 , there will be a relation for @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 where @xmath82",
    "to leading order in @xmath17 via mae , we have @xmath83 one can proceed to solve the radial integrals for the motion @xmath84 in the near region , one has @xmath85 and in the far region , it gives @xmath86 now , all integrals can be performed , @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 denote the integration constants . in the overlap region , we have @xmath90 matching @xmath91 , the relations between the integration constants are @xmath92 finally , we can get the integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ phifphin ] ) and ( [ tftn ] ) .",
    "in particular , for the case that the photons are limited in the equatorial plane @xmath77 or @xmath78 , the shifts in the azimuthal angle @xmath3 and time @xmath4 can be calculated as @xmath93 for the case that the photons are emitted from a distant source , pass by near a black hole , and finally are observed by a distant observer , their deflection angle and time delay can be measured with eqs .",
    "( [ fphi ] ) and ( [ ft ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , we assume one endpoint is near the photon sphere of the black hole and other one is located at infinity , then we have the deflection angle and time delay in the strong gravitational limit for the photons with @xmath94 , @xmath95 where the factor 2 comes from the symmetry analysis of the geodesics . here",
    "we neglect the effects of back - reaction and observer - independence of the speed of light @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we considered a special class of null geodesics in an extremal kn black hole background .",
    "the geodesics are near a critical point , where the turning point locates at the horizon and photons emitted from the near - horizon region can freely travel to a distant observatory . adopting the matched asymptotic expansion method",
    ", we performed the integrals for the null geodesic and derived the algebraic equations , see eqs .",
    "( [ rrr ] ) , ( [ fphi ] ) , and ( [ ft ] ) .",
    "these equations are parameterized by @xmath96 given in ( [ lambda ] ) and ( [ qq ] ) .",
    "they relate two endpoints , one is near the horizon @xmath97 and another locates at a far region from the black hole @xmath98 .",
    "moreover , in these equations , we assumed that the polar angles @xmath99 .",
    "however , the photons are free of the polar angle when they move from the near region to the far one .",
    "a stronger constraint is that the photon trajectory is limited in the equatorial plane @xmath100 , which is also a simple requirement when considering the strong black hole lensing . as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , whether one assumes @xmath99 or not , the parameter @xmath101 must be positive .",
    "for the extremal kerr black hole , @xmath2 must be in the region @xmath102 . while for the extremal kn black hole , such region is modified by the black hole charge .",
    "for example , the condition @xmath103 must be held , which implies that @xmath2 should lie between @xmath104 and @xmath105 . when the black hole charge vanishes , it recovers the region for the kerr black hole . on the other hand ,",
    "when the black hole charge approaches its maximum @xmath106 , the region will approximately be @xmath107 .",
    "a detailed analysis suggests that this region shrinks with the increase of the black hole charge .",
    "since our analysis of the null geodesics is near the critical point that the photons can escape from the black hole , many astronomical phenomena are related with it , such as the black hole lensing and shadow . so using the analytical results obtained in this paper",
    ", one can consider these phenomena in an analytical way for the extremal black hole .",
    "moreover , like the kerr black hole , the kn black hole also has a near - horizon conformal symmetry . and",
    "it provides a simple extended example differing from the kerr black hole , which is also useful for studying other black holes with more than one rotating parameter .",
