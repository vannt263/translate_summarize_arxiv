    "the concept of soliton as regular localized stable solutions of nonlinear differential equations is being widely utilized in pure science @xcite .",
    "one of the fields to apply the soliton concept is the elementary particle physics , where the soliton solutions of nonlinear field equations are used as the simplest models of extended particles @xcite .",
    "development of general relativity ( gr ) and quantum field theory ( qft ) leads to the increasing interest to study the role of gravitational field in elementary particle physics . to obtain and study the properties of regular localized solutions to the nonlinear classical field equations",
    "is motivated mainly by a hope to create a consistent , divergence - free theory . these solutions , as was remarked by rajaraman  @xcite give us one of the ways of modeling elementary particles as extended objects with complicated spatial structure .",
    "in such attempts it is natural to treat the field nonlinearity not only as a tool for avoiding the theoretical difficulties ( such as singularities ) but also as a reflection of real properties of physical system .",
    "it should be also emphasized that the complete description of elementary particles with all their physical characteristics ( e.g. , magnetic momentum ) can be given only in the framework of interacting field theory  @xcite .",
    "let us remark that the choice the field equations is one of the principle problems in nonlinear theory .",
    "at present there is no criterion for the selection of interaction lagrangian and any lorentz - invariant combination of field functions can be considered as such lagrangian .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present some new results ( anti - droplets and hats ) , in addition to those illustrated in  @xcite for an interacting system of scalar and electromagnetic fields , confining ourselves to static , spherically and/or cylindrically symmetric configurations since the effect of gravitational fields on the properties of regular localized solutions significantly depends on the symmetry of the system .",
    "so that the field equations possess regular solutions it is necessary to introduce nonlinear terms , describing the field interactions , in the lagrangian .",
    "we consider the nonlinear generalization of the theory that is related to the introduction of direct interaction between neutral scalar and electromagnetic fields .",
    "the decay process like @xmath2 , described by the effective lagrangian @xcite @xmath3 indicates to the possibility of such generalization .",
    "thus we consider a system with the lagrangian @xmath4 where @xmath5 is some arbitrary function characterizing interaction between the scalar @xmath6 and electromagnetic @xmath7 fields takes the form @xmath8 as is seen , for @xmath9 , @xmath10 and we have the system with minimal coupling .",
    "note that the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) describes the system of fields with positive definite energy if @xmath11 .",
    "this kind of interaction has been thoroughly discussed in  @xcite .",
    "let us write the scalar and the electromagnetic field equations corresponding to the lagrangian([lag ] ) @xmath12 @xmath13 the corresponding energy - momentum tensor reads @xmath14 \\label{emt}\\ ] ]",
    "as an external homogenous and isotropic gravitational field we choose the frw space - time .",
    "this universe is very important as the corresponding cosmological models coincides with observation .",
    "the interval in the frw universe in general takes the form  @xcite @xmath15   \\label{met}\\ ] ] here @xmath16 defines the size of the universe , and @xmath17 takes the values @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we consider the simple most case putting @xmath20 constant , which corresponds to the static frw universe . in static case",
    "@xmath21 corresponds to usual minkowski space , @xmath22 describes the close einstein universe @xcite and @xmath23 corresponds to the space - time with hyperbolic spatial cross - section .",
    "note that the velocity of light @xmath24 has been taken to be unity .    as was mentioned earlier , we seek the static , spherically symmetric solutions to the equations ( [ scl ] ) and ( [ em ] ) . to this end",
    "we assume that the scalar field is the function of @xmath25 only , i.e. @xmath26 and the electromagnetic field possesses only one component @xmath27 .    under the assumption made above",
    ", the solution to the equation ( [ em ] ) reads @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the constant of integration and @xmath30 putting ( [ emf ] ) into ( [ scl ] ) for the scalar field we obtain the equation with `` induced nonlinearity ''  @xcite @xmath31 this equation can be written in the form @xmath32 with the first integral @xmath33 where we substitute @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 is the constant of integration , which under the regularity condition of @xmath36 at the center turns to be trivial , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "finally we write the solution to the scalar field equation in quadrature @xmath38 in accordance with ( [ emf ] ) and ( [ int1 ] ) from ( [ emt ] ) we find the density of field energy of the system @xmath39 and total energy of the material field system @xmath40 thus , we see that the energy density @xmath36 and total energy @xmath41 of the configurations obtained do not depend on the conventional values of the parameter @xmath17 . as one sees , to write the scalar @xmath6 and vector @xmath42 functions as well as the energy density @xmath43 and energy of the material fields @xmath44 explicitly , one has to give @xmath45 in explicit form . here",
    "we will give a detailed analysis for some concrete forms of @xmath45 .",
    "let us choose @xmath45 in the form @xmath46 with @xmath47 being the interaction parameter . inserting ( [ cos ] ) into ( [ fe ] )",
    "we get the sin - gordon type equation  @xcite @xmath48 with the solution @xmath49 , \\quad b = { { \\lambda q \\sqrt{p_0}}\\over{r } } , \\quad z_1 = { \\rm const }   \\label{ssg}\\ ] ] let us analyze the solution ( [ ssg ] ) .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath50 for all @xmath17 .",
    "as one sees , the solution possesses meaning only in the region where @xmath51 .",
    "it means , in case of @xmath52 the configuration confines in the interval @xmath53 .",
    "then the asymptotic behavior of the solution ( [ ssg ] ) can be written as @xmath54 from ( [ toten ] ) we find the total energy of the system @xmath55 . for the choice of @xmath45 in the form @xmath56 with @xmath47 being the coupling constant and @xmath57 being some arbitrary constant , from ( [ fe ] ) we obtain @xmath58 the equation ( [ mkdv ] ) can be seen as an mkdv one .",
    "indeed , a kdv equation @xmath59 can always be converted to @xmath60 if one looks for stationary solution of the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 . in our particular case @xmath63 and",
    "the equation ( [ mkdv ] ) is an mkdv one .",
    "the scalar field function in this case has the form @xmath64 , \\quad b = { { 2q}\\over{r } } \\label{th}\\ ] ] taking into account that @xmath65 one sees that at the origin @xmath66 whereas at the asymptotic region for different value of @xmath17 we get @xmath67 from ( [ toten ] ) we find the total energy of the system to be @xmath68 .",
    "a specific type of solution to the nonlinear field equations in flat space - time was obtained in a series of interesting articles  @xcite .",
    "these solutions are known as droplet - like solutions or simply droplets .",
    "the distinguishing property of these solutions is the availability of some sharp boundary defining the space domain in which the material field happens to be located , i.e. , the field is zero beyond this area .",
    "it was found that the solutions mentioned exist in field theory with specific interactions that can be considered as an effective one , generated by initial interactions of unknown origin .",
    "in contrast to the widely known soliton - like solutions , with field functions and energy density asymptotically tending to zero at spatial infinity , the solutions in question vanish at a finite distance from the center of the system ( in the case of spherical symmetry ) or from the axis ( in the case of cylindrical symmetry ) .",
    "thus , there exists a sphere or cylinder with critical radius @xmath69 outside of which the fields disappear .",
    "therefore the field configurations have a droplet - like structure  @xcite .    to obtain the droplet - like configuration",
    "we choose a very specific type of interaction function @xmath70 which has the form  @xcite [ cf .",
    "1 ] @xmath71 where @xmath72 . putting ( [ p ] ) into ( [ qua ] ) one",
    "gets @xmath73 \\label{mod}\\ ] ] let us consider the case when @xmath74 .",
    "taking the sign in exponent to be `` minus '' one from ( [ mod ] ) we obtain @xmath75^{\\sigma/2 } \\label{drop}\\ ] ] recalling that @xmath76 from ( [ drop ] ) we see that at @xmath77 the scalar field @xmath78 takes the value @xmath79 and at @xmath80 , the scalar field function becomes trivial , i.e. , @xmath81 it is obvious that for @xmath82 the value of the square bracket turns out to be negative and @xmath83 becomes imaginary , since @xmath84 is an odd number .",
    "since we are interested in real @xmath78 only , without loss of generality we may assume the value of @xmath78 to be zero for @xmath85 , the matching at @xmath86 ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) being smooth [ cf .",
    "fig . 2 ] . note that , for @xmath22 , the scalar field is confined in the region @xmath53 , as it was in previous two cases .",
    "the total energy of the droplet we obtain from ( [ toten ] ) has the form @xmath88 as is seen from ( [ te ] ) , the value of the total energy does not depend on the size of the droplet , it means droplets of different linear size share the same total energy .",
    "let us now back to ( [ mod ] ) again and consider the sign in exponent to be `` plus '' .",
    "in this case we find @xmath89^{\\sigma/2 } \\label{androp}\\ ] ] contrary to the droplet this configuration possesses trivial value up to @xmath90 , then begins to increase taking maximum value at spatial infinity : @xmath91^{\\sigma/2 } \\le 1\\ ] ] note that the total energy of the anti - droplet ( [ androp ] ) is equal to that of the droplet .",
    "finally we consider another very interesting case putting @xmath92 where @xmath93 . putting ( [ q ] ) into ( [ qua ] ) one",

    "given @xmath107 in the form ( [ kdv ] ) we find that @xmath108 as is seen from ( [ kdvstab ] ) the equations with polynomial type of nonlinearity too contain some stable solutions . for the droplet - like configurations , i.e. , for the interacting term @xmath45 given by ( [ p ] ) , it can be shown that the potential @xmath109 beginning with @xmath110 .",
    "it means that the droplet - like configurations ( [ drop ] ) with @xmath110 are stable for the class of perturbation , vanishing at @xmath111 and @xmath86 .",
    "the same can be concluded for the solutions ( [ androp ] ) and ( [ loc ] ) .",
    "in the previous section we studied the possibility of formation of regular localized configuration in homogenous and isotropic frw universe .",
    "let us now continue our study in the homogenous but anisotropic universe .",
    "in particular we consider the model proposed by g@xmath0del .",
    "the linear element of g@xmath0del universe in cylindrical coordinates reads  @xcite @xmath112 d \\phi^2 -{{\\sqrt{8}}\\over{\\omega } } { \\rm sinh}^2 \\omega \\rho d\\phi dt - dz^2 \\label{gmet}\\ ] ] where the constant @xmath113 is related with the angular velocity @xmath114 : @xmath115 .",
    "this form of linear element of the four - dimensional homogenous space @xmath116 directly exhibits its rotational symmetry , since the @xmath117 do not depend on @xmath118 .",
    "it is easy to find @xmath119 i.e. at @xmath120 g@xmath0del universe transfers to the flat one .    as in spherically symmetric case , here",
    "too we seek the static solutions to the equations ( [ scl ] ) and ( [ em ] ) assuming the scalar field to be the function of @xmath121 only , i.e. , @xmath122 and the electromagnetic possesses only one component @xmath123 .",

    "this trivial solution is stitched with the solution at @xmath155 under condition @xmath156 , which fulfills if and only if @xmath157 .",
    "consequently , at @xmath152 the lagrangian becomes physically meaningless , however its limiting value at @xmath158 is equal to zero .",
    "continuing it at @xmath152 , one can consider the field be totally trivial in this area .",
    "thus we get the droplet - like configuration .",
    "the field @xmath78 steadily decreases from @xmath159 to @xmath160 with @xmath161 ( for @xmath162 ) and @xmath163 .",
    "the total energy of the `` droplet '' is defined as @xmath164 which remains unaltered even in flat space - time ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "it means that the `` droplet '' does not feel g@xmath0del gravitational field .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath166 we obtain the configuration ( anti - droplet ) possessing trivial value at @xmath167 . starting from @xmath168",

    "analogically , we can conclude that the hat - like configurations are also stable beginning with @xmath110 . here",
    "it should be emphasized that , contrary to the droplets ( anti - droplets ) where @xmath84 may be big enough , in case of hat - like solutions @xmath84 should be small .",

    "nevertheless , one can always choose @xmath194 in such a way , e.g. , @xmath195\\ ] ] that @xmath78 takes reasonable value .",
    "we obtained the regular particle - like solutions to the scalar field equations with induced nonlinearity in external gravitational fields described by freedman - robertson - walker and g@xmath0del universes respectively . beside the usual solitons , a special type of regular localized configurations , known as droplets ,",
    "have been obtained .",
    "it has been shown that the droplet - like configurations possess limited energy density and finite total energy and the droplets of different linear sizes up to the soliton share one and the same total energy .",
    "it is noteworthy to notice that in the spherically symmetrical case ( i.e. , in the frw universe ) at @xmath196 for @xmath197 droplet transfers to usual solitonian solution , while for @xmath198 this is not the case .",
    "it has also been shown that in frw space - time equations with different type of nonlinearities may contain stable solutions , whereas in case of g@xmath0del universe only the droplet - like and hat - like configurations may be stable .",
    "it is noteworthy to remark that in frw space - time with @xmath22 the field function is confined in the region @xmath53 independent to the choice of interaction function @xmath107 .",
