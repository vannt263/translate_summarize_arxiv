    "diffuse backgrounds and their structure contain important information about the history of the early universe , when discrete objects either do not exist or are not accessible to telescopic studies .",
    "the formation and early evolution of galaxies should have generated radiation redshifted into the infrared bands ( e.g. partridge and peebles 1967 ; bond et al.1986 ) .",
    "this cosmic infrared background ( cib ) may come from the entire history of the universe between the epoch of last scattering , mapped by the microwave background , and the present day .",

    "1998 ) . their galactic dust emission model ( arendt et al .",
    "1998 ) is derived from fits to the dirbe data and comparison to hydrogen maps , and accounts for the variation of dust temperature .",
    "their model for galactic starlight is derived from external star count models , with no free parameters .",
    "the residuals from the modeling were not significantly above the uncertainties except at 140 and 240 .",
    "the firas instrument on cobe gave similar answers , ( fixsen , mather , bennett , and shafer , 1998 ) , using three different methods for removing the foregrounds .",
    "the agreement is significant because the instruments were calibrated independently .",
    "the measured values of the far - ir background are comparable to the total observed galactic emission at visible and near - ir wavelengths , and imply that about half of the luminosity of the universe has been obscured by dust and converted into far - ir radiation .",
    "some distant galaxies might be more reddened or obscured by dust than otherwise expected , and the cib and its fluctuations might be brighter than predicted from visible band galaxy counts .    in this paper we continue our search for a cib by trying to detect its spatial structure in the dirbe data .",
    "the method is similar to that first suggested by gunn and later applied in the visible ( shectman 1973 , 1974 ) and uv ( martin and bowyer 1989 ) .",
    "recently , vogeley ( 1998 ) applied the method to the hubble deep field constraining the amount of the visible cosmic background , concluding that there is very little visible cosmic background from unresolved sources .",
    "they considered arcsecond scales where fluctuations are dominated by random parts of individual galaxy ( vogeley 1998 ) or cluster ( shectman 1974 ) profiles .",
    "we apply the method to degree scales where the dominant contribution comes from galaxy clustering .",

    "we show that for the measured galaxy correlation function we expect fluctuations of about 5 to 10% in the cib flux on 0.5  scales , almost independently of the particular mechanism of the cib production .",
    "we discuss our search for the cib structure in the dirbe data between 1 and 100 .",
    "the last two bands of dirbe - 140 and 240   - are not useful for this because of the large instrument noise there .",
    "section [ s3 ] deals with the beam profile and the spatial window function for power spectrum analysis .",
    "section [ s4 ] discusses the data for @xmath17 , where the foregrounds are dominated by stellar emission from the galaxy .",
    "we find a significant trend in the amplitude of the measured fluctuations with galactic latitude .",
    "when our star removal algorithm is applied to simulated data , we recover the measured slope of the correlation with galactic latitude , and extrapolation of the simulated fluctuations to @xmath18 leads to a zero intercept .",
    "we derive a formula relating the measured fluctuations to star counts and show that for a plane - parallel galaxy there should be a simple relationship between the @xmath19 dependence of the fluctuations and the slope of the star counts function at the galactic pole .",
    "then we show that for @xmath20 and @xmath21 the measured structure of the galaxy fits the plane - parallel model .",
    "furthermore , the scatter in the @xmath22 - cosec@xmath23 plot is low enough to allow an extrapolation to @xmath18 , with positive intercepts in all four near - ir bands .",
    "we perform a power spectrum analysis but most of the measured structure is due to fluctuating star counts .",
    "if the star removal algorithm removes stars fainter than 5 times the confusion noise limit , there are too few pixels left to calculate a power spectrum .",

    "we test our methods with numerical and analytic models of the galaxy and possible cib contributions and find good agreement with the data .",
    "results from the mid- to far - ir bands , where foreground emission structure is dominated by the large scale gradients from dust emission in the solar system and the galaxy , are presented in sec .",
    "the upper limits on these fluctuations are @xmath24 1 2sr , depending on wavelength , and provide much stronger tests of the predictions of galaxy counts than do direct measurements from inside the zodiacal dust cloud .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .",
    "here we provide a general mathematical basis without specific cosmological and galaxy evolution models .",
    "we will use the data to constrain the cib properties in a model - independent way , and then to constrain models of galaxy evolution .",
    "we extend our previous work ( paper i , i ; jimenez & kashlinsky 1999 ) to show the power spectrum of the fluctuations and to estimate the typical amplitude of the fluctuations in a model - independent way .",
    "we start with definitions .",
    "the surface brightness in the cib per unit wavelength will be denoted as @xmath25 , per unit frequency as @xmath26 , and per logarithmic wavelength interval @xmath27 , and we call them all `` flux . ''",
    "the fluctuation in the cib flux is then @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the two dimensional coordinate on the sky and @xmath30 denotes ensemble averaging .",
    "we also use the two - dimensional fourier transform , @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath32 field is a random variable , then it can be described by the moments of its probability distribution function .",
    "the first non - trivial moment is the projected 2-dimensional correlation function @xmath33 .",
    "the 2-dimensional power spectrum is @xmath34 , where the average is performed over all phases .",
    "the correlation function and the power spectrum are a pair of 2-dimensional fourier transforms and for isotropically distributed signal are related by @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the @xmath38-th order cylindrical bessel function . if the phases are random , then the distribution of the flux field is gaussian and the correlation function , or its fourier transform the power spectrum , uniquely describe its statistics . in measurements with a finite beam radius",
    "@xmath39 the intrinsic power spectrum is multiplied by the window function @xmath40 of the instrument .",
    "another useful quantity is the mean square fluctuation within a finite beam , or zero - lag correlation signal , which is related to the power spectrum by @xmath41 for a top - hat beam the window function is @xmath42 ^ 2=0.5 $ ] at @xmath43 where @xmath44 , and hence the values of @xmath45 correspond to fluctuations on angular scales of diameter @xmath46 .",

    "we introduce the 3-dimensional two - point correlation function of galaxy clustering , @xmath48 , and its 3-dimensional power spectrum , @xmath49 .",

    "it is illustrative to study the redshift dependence of the flux rate production , eq .",

    "the factor @xmath76 varies little with @xmath47 , and the rate of flux production is governed by the comoving bolometric luminosity density @xmath77 and the sed of the galaxy emission @xmath71 .",

    "if @xmath78 increases towards shorter wavelengths then @xmath15 increases with @xmath47 . for @xmath79 const , and no luminosity evolution ,",
    "the rate is roughly constant with small @xmath47 .",
    "in addition , there is observational evidence for an increase of @xmath77 out to @xmath80 in the galaxy rest - frame uv to near - ir ( 1 ) bands ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ) . at sufficiently high redshifts , the evolution in eq .",
    "( [ e6 ] ) would be offset by the factor @xmath76 , so that the rate of production would be cut off at sufficiently large @xmath47 .",
    "this factor is responsible for resolving olbers paradox even for a flat sed .",
    "the sed for rest - frame @xmath81  is dominated by stellar emission , with a peak at visible wavelengths and a decrease for @xmath82 .",
    "consequently , most of the predicted j band cib comes from redshifts @xmath83 , which shifts the visible emission of normal stellar populations into the j band ; cf .",

    "the emission is dominated by galactic dust and the situation is reversed , so @xmath71 increases with wavelength roughly as @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "hence , the dusty star - burst galaxies observed by iras at low redshifts should make the dominant contribution to the 10  cib . in the far - ir , the measured cib found by dirbe can have large contributions from high redshifts .",
    "measurements of the correlation function @xmath88 have an important advantage over direct determinations of the cib spatial power spectrum , because they are immune to the discontinuities in the maps created by point source removal .",
    "( because , in practice , @xmath14 is evaluated from masked data , the uncertainties of the @xmath14 points are themselves correlated . )",

    "a simpler method is to work with the fourier transform of the correlation function , @xmath90 , which contains the same information as @xmath14 and is easier to interpret . as for",
    "@xmath14 the effects of the mask will produce correlations of the power spectrum points with each other . also , the measured power spectrum is the convolution of the fourier transform of the mask with the true power .",
    "although the uncertainties in @xmath14 and @xmath90 can be evaluated from theory , we evaluated them from the data by comparing multiple measurements .    the limber equation ( [ e5 ] )",
