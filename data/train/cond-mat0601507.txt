    "nevertheless the position of the bottom of quasiparticle bands , the intersection with the fermi level , and the shape of the experimental and theoretical dispersions qualitatively agree .",
    "in this paper we focused on the long - standing controversy concerning the strength of correlation effects in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , i.e. , on the question whether sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 should be considered a strongly correlated electron material .",
    "this is generally the case if the ratio of coulomb interaction and kinetic energy ( bandwidth ) is larger than unity . in particular , electronic correlations lead to a typical redistribution of spectral weight and thereby to the formation of well pronounced lower and upper hubbard bands ( lhb , uhb ) .",
    "we note that even on the experimental level the unambiguous identification of a maximum in the spectrum of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is made complicated by the overlap of the ru-4@xmath4 and o-2@xmath11 bands .    to answer this question we first calculated the electronic structure of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 within the conventional band theory using lda .",
    "the correlations were then taken into account in the framework of the lda+dmft(qmc ) scheme using _ ab initio _ values for the coulomb and hund exchange parameters .",
    "we found that the ratio of coulomb interaction and bandwidth is indeed larger than unity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , despite the rather extended @xmath6-states of ru , leading to a distinctive redistribution of spectral weight and to the formation of a well - pronounced lhb . by comparing our theoretical spectra with xps experiments we unambiguously identified this lhb with the structure observed at -3 ev .",
    "by contrast , the lda dos shows no distinctive feature at that energy .    to describe the experimental spectra in a wide energy range we employed a wannier function formalism to transform the self - energy operator back to the full - orbital basis .",
    "the theoretical spectra obtained in that way agree very well with high - photon energy photoemission data ; in particular , they reproduce the shoulder in the spectrum caused by the lhb .",
    "the basic features of the low photon energy ups and intermediate energy pes spectra are also reproduced by the lda+dmft(qmc ) .",
    "quasiparticle bands induced by correlations with mass renormalization of about 2.5 agree well with results from arpes , dhva and infrared optical experiments .",
    "the lda+dmft(qmc ) derived quasiparticle bands are even in quantitative agreement with the dispersion extracted from arpes data . taken together",
    "these results provide clear evidence for strong electronic correlation effects in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . hence , although sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is a @xmath6 system it must be regarded as a strongly correlated electron material .",
