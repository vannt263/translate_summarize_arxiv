    "let @xmath0 be a flag variety .",
    "as it is well known , the study of @xmath0 , both from the geometric and topological point of view , heavily relies on the study of its schubert cells and schubert varieties .",
    "for example , the former give a stratification of @xmath0 and the latter turn out to provide a nice understanding of the multiplicative structure of the cohomology ring of @xmath0 .",
    "in this context , it is important to understand how schubert varieties and opposite schubert varieties intersect .",
    "such intersections are called richardson varieties ; they have been extensively studied for the last twenty years .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the present paper to give a complete overview of these studies and we will restrict ourselves to a short indicative list of works related to our own interests and considerations in the present work .",
    "further references on the subject may be found by the interested reader in the few papers that we quote .",
    "early works on richardson varieties include [ d ] and [ r ] , where fundamental properties are studied , including their irreducibility .",
    "more recently , the extension of standard monomial theory to richardson varieties was investigated in [ llit ] in connection with some @xmath1-theoretic issues .",
    "related results in the case of the type a grassmannians may be found in [ kl ] .",
    "further , these varieties were used as central tools in [ bl ] in order to pursue the goal of providing a more geometric understanding of standard monomial theory .    to finish this quick overview ,",
    "let us mention the paper [ m ] where the existence of ( semi-)toric degenerations of richardson varieties is obtained , by means of representation theoretic methods based on canonical bases .",
    "+ beyond the classical case mentioned above , the theory of quantum groups provides natural analogues of schubert varieties and , more generally , of richardson varieties . undoubtedly , the role of these quantum analogues in the study of quantum groups and quantum homogeneous spaces will be as central as it is in the classical setting .",
    "the objective of the present article is to establish some fundamental results regarding these objects , in the case where the flag variety into consideration is a type a grassmannian .    to start with ,",
    "let us briefly describe quantum richardson varieties in the type a grassmannian case .",
    "fix an arbitrary base field @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 be integers such that @xmath5 .",
    "consider the quantum analogue of the coordinate ring on the affine space of @xmath6 matrices : @xmath7 and let @xmath8 be the set of @xmath9-tuples @xmath10 of integers such that @xmath11 equipped with the obvious product order inhereted from @xmath12 . to any element @xmath13 , we may associate the quantum minor , denoted @xmath14 $ ] , of @xmath7 built on the rows with index in @xmath15 and columns @xmath16 to @xmath9 of the generic matrix of @xmath7 .",
    "the subalgebra , @xmath17 , of @xmath7 generated by these quantum minors is a natural analogue of the homogeneous coordinate ring of the grassmannian with respect to the plcker embedding .",
    "it is then easy to associate to any element @xmath18 a quantum schubert and quantum opposite schubert variety by considering the factor algebras @xmath19,\\ , k\\in\\pi_{m , n},\\ , k\\not\\leq i\\rangle$ ] and @xmath19,\\ , k\\in\\pi_{m , n},\\ , k\\not\\geq i \\rangle$ ] , respectively .",
    "a natural analogue of the richardson variety associated to a pair @xmath20 of elements of @xmath21 being then defined as the factor algebra @xmath19,\\ , k\\in\\pi_{m , n},\\ , k \\not\\in [ i , j]\\rangle$ ] .",
    "( notice the abuse of language : these algebras are actually quantum analogues of homogeneous coordinate rings rather than quantum analogues of varieties . ) for the convenience of the reader , we have included a short appendix at the end of the paper where classical richardson varieties in type a grassmannians are described in some details .",
    "the material in this appendix also provides a justification of the above definition of quantum richardson variety . + it is worth noting , at this stage , that quantum analogues of schubert and richardson varieties in partial flag varieties attached to simple lie algebras of any type may be defined in a natural way ( see [ lres ] for the case of schubert varieties ) .",
    "this requires , however , a representation theoretic approach which forces to work under strong genericity hypotheses on the deformation parameter . the interested reader may consult the paper [ y1 ] by m. yakimov for such an approach .",
    "in contrast , in the present paper , we adopt a method which allows us to work over any base field and with no assumption on the deformation parameter .",
    "it is inspired by the standard monomial theory which originates in works of de concini , eisenbud , procesi , lakshmibai , in the classical setting , and has its roots in early investigations by hodge on grassmannians .",
    "the interested reader may consult , in particular , the following references : [ dep ] , [ gl ] , [ lrag ] .",
    "indeed , we first show that quantum analogues of richardson varieties may be endowed with the structure of a ( symmetric quantum ) algebra with a straightening law .",
    "that is , we exhibit a standard monomial basis for this algebra , built from a finite ordered set of generators and show that straightening and commutation relations satisfying certain very particular combinatorial constraints hold among these generators .",
    "we then deduce that quantum analogues of richardson varieties may be filtered in such a way that their associated graded ring is a tractable quantum analogue of coordinate ring of a toric variety . hence proving that quantum analogues of richardson varieties degenerate to quantum analogues of toric varieties .",
    "we then derive from this important results of quantum analogues of richardon varieties such as their irreducibility and cohen - macaulayness in the sense of artin and shelter .",
    "actually , we work in a more general context : we first introduce the class of _ symmetric quantum algebras with a straightening law _ and then isolate a subclass , the objects of which can be degenerated to quantum toric rings .",
    "we then show that this machinery applies to quantum richardson varieties .",
    "needless to say , since we are working in the non - commutative setting , the aforementioned commutation relations are a main issue in the present work .",
    "actually , these relations are taken into account in the algebra with a staightening law structure .",
    "+ we finish this introduction by stressing two main remarks .",
    "first , similar results have been obtained in [ lr1 ] and [ lr2 ] in the case of quantum analogues of schubert varieties ( which are special cases of quantum richardson varieties ) . however , to deal with the case of richardson varieties is significantly harder .",
    "for example , to prove that quantum analogues of richardson varieties are integral domains already requires the full strength of the results in the present paper .",
    "namely , the fact that quantum analogues of richardson varieties degenerate to quantum analogues of toric varieties .",
    "( a much more elementary proof of the fact that quantum analogues of schubert varities are integral domains is given in [ lr2 ] . )",
    "second , quantum richardson varieties are investigated here from the point of view of non - commutative algebraic geometry .",
    "however , the results of [ lr1 ] and [ lr2 ] concerning the special case of quantum schubert varieties have been used in [ llr ] to study the latter from a different point of view .",
    "namely , the non - commutative structure on quantum flag varieties actually comes from a poisson structure on the corresponding classical flag variety , in the spirit of deformation theory .",
    "recent works have shed light on the connection between certain torus - invariant prime ideals in quantum flag varieties , symplectic leaves of the corresponding classical objects and certain cell decompositions in their _ totally positive _ counterpart .",
    "the reader may also consult the references [ gll1 ] , [ gll2 ] , [ y2 ] and the survey article [ ll ] for more details on this point of view .",
    "we expect quantum richardson varieties will be a strong tool to further study these connections .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows . in section [ distributive - lattices ] ,",
    "basic results that we need on distributive lattices are recalled .",
    "the material in this section is well known .",
    "we have summerized these results for the convenience of the reader . in section [ section - toric ] a class of quantum algebras associated with any distributive lattice",
    "is introduced .",
    "these are quotients of quantum affine spaces by binomials defined on the basis of the attached lattice .",
    "they are natural quantum analogues of coordinate rings of toric varieties . in section [ section - sqasl ] ,",
    "we introduce the notion of _ symetric quantum graded algebra with a straightening law _",
    "( symetric quantum graded a.s.l . , for short ) .",
    "it is a subclass of the class of quantum graded algebras with a straightening law defined in [ lr1 ; def .",

    ". structure .",
    "a subclass of the class of symetric quantum graded a.s.l .",
    "is then defined , in section [ section - condc - degeneration ] , by means of an extra condition ( c ) which is imposed .",
    "this class includes the quantum toric varieties introduced in section [ section - toric ] which are particularly simple examples .",
    "actually much more is true : the quantum toric varieties are `` essential '' such examples in the sense that any algebra in this class degenerate to such an algebra . in section [ qarv ]",
    "we reach our original motivation .",
    "we first show that quantum grassmannians are symetric quantum graded a.s.l . satisfying condition ( c ) .",
