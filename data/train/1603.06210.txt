    "denote by @xmath5 the banach algebra of all bounded linear operators on @xmath4 , and by @xmath6 the ideal of the compact operators in @xmath5 .",
    "given @xmath7 , a fundamental problem of ( linear ) numerical mathematics is to approximate the solution of the operator equation @xmath8 a standard procedure is to choose a sequence of projections @xmath9 which converge in some sense to the identity operator , and a sequence of operators @xmath10 such that the @xmath11 converge to @xmath12 , and to replace equation with the `` simpler '' equations @xmath13 the solutions @xmath14 being sought in @xmath15 .",
    "the crucial question is if this method _ applies _ to @xmath12 , _",
    "i.e. _ if the equations possess unique solutions @xmath14 for every right - hand side @xmath16 and for every sufficiently large @xmath17 , and if these solutions @xmath14 converge to the solution @xmath18 of the original equation .",
    "it is easy to see that the applicability of the method is equivalent to the stability of the sequence @xmath19 by which we mean that there is an @xmath20 such that for @xmath21 the operators @xmath22 are invertible and the norms of the inverses are uniformly bounded . on the other hand , it is well known that the invertibility of @xmath12 is not enough to guaranty the applicability of the method or the stability of the sequence .",
    "a related problem , which originates from statistical physics where finite - dimensional systems of very large dimension ( on the order of @xmath23 ) appear , is to infer properties of the large finite - dimensional operator from its infinite - dimensional counterpart .",
    "the projections @xmath24 are chosen depending on the space @xmath4 , the operator @xmath12 , and the purpose for studying .",
    "if @xmath4 is a lebesgue function space , typical projections are related to spline approximation methods or the finite section method ( fsm ) . for function spaces on the real line ,",
    "the projections associated with the fsm are simply the operators @xmath25}i$ ] of multiplication with the characteristic functions of the interval @xmath26 $ ] , respectively .",
    "approximation methods have been studied since the mid 1970s by many authors with the use of the so - called algebraic techniques .",
    "the main idea is to embed the approximation sequence @xmath27 in a certain algebra of approximation sequences , in which the applicability of the method is easily related to an invertibility problem in that algebra .",
    "the application of banach algebra techniques to singular integral and convolution operators of increasing complexity in several directions ( from continuous coefficients or symbols , to piecewise continuous , slowly oscillating , almost - periodic and so on ; similarly from the cauchy singular integral operators , to wiener - hopf , then wiener - hopf plus hankel operators , or even algebras generated by such operators ) first on the lebesgue space @xmath28 ( resulting in c@xmath29-algebras ) , then on @xmath30 for @xmath31 has led to a great increase in the technical difficulty of the proofs .",
    "our main objective in this paper is in a sense to apply a simpler but more powerful and robust variant of the algebraic technique that is capable of solving the applicability problem with the greatest generality in terms of spaces , symbols and coefficients and with much simpler proofs .",
    "we will prove the following main result , which shows that for a large class of operators , the finite section method is applicable if and only if the operator is invertible . in the other cases",
    "our method gives the necessary and sufficient conditions for the applicability of the fsm , in terms of the invertibility of an additional collection of operators , each a homomorphic image of the original approximation sequence , which we call _",
    "snapshots_.    [ tintro ]",
    "let @xmath12 be an operator with its related finite section sequence @xmath32 belonging to a certain class @xmath33 .",
    "then the finite section method applies to @xmath12 if and only if all snapshots are invertible in @xmath5 .",
    "the class @xmath33 of theorem [ tintro ] covers finite section sequences of sums and products of multiplication operators and convolution operators , with highly discontinuous generating functions , including @xmath34 functions with limits at infinity for the multiplication operators and slowly oscillating , almost periodic and piecewise continuous functions for the convolution operators , which can be present together for the first time .",
    "we believe that the ideas described here can be used with advantage over the traditional algebraic methods to study spline approximation methods , or approximation methods in many other spaces .    the paper is organized as follows : in the next section",
    "we introduce definitions and some basic results for the function and multiplier spaces .",
    "we use in some cases simpler definitions than before , and discuss their relation with the classically defined spaces .",
    "we also review the previous results regarding the finite section method for convolution - type operators , and introduce the @xmath3-framework , which is the basis of the new approach .",
    "we finish the section by discussing the classes of operators that can be included in the @xmath3-framework . in the third section , which is the core of the paper ,",
    "we introduce the notion of rich sequences and develop the whole algebraic procedure until proving the main result in several versions , one of them even including the flip operator .",
    "finally , in the last section , we compare the new results with the older ones and discuss the change of paradigm which results from the present approach .",
    "we collect in this section some definitions , concepts and base results that are needed in the latter part of the work and prove some new and highly interesting results on the classification of convolution operators .",
    "we also give very briefly some pointers to the history of the use of algebraic techniques in approximation methods .",

    "the definition of @xmath45 is not the usual one , but it is chosen here for two reasons : firstly it gives the definitions of @xmath45 and @xmath46 in a unified and consistent picture , and secondly it is much more convenient for the subsequent proofs .",
    "actually , this characterization of @xmath45 is equivalent to the classical definition :    the algebra @xmath45 is exactly the algebra of the functions with finite one - sided limits at each point @xmath48 .",

    "finite section method _",
    "@xmath127 for an operator @xmath12 .",
    "the applicability and properties of the fsm described above , and its discrete analogue in sequence spaces caught the interest of a large number of researchers that have obtained and extended results in various directions since at least the 1960s up to the present : various types of symbols and operators @xcite , multidimensional case @xcite , spline methods @xcite , toeplitz , hankel and other operators @xcite , asymptotics , behavior of eigenvalues , approximation numbers and numerical ranges @xcite , structure of the approximation algebras @xcite , are just some examples .",
    "the above references are far from being exhaustive , see also the monographs @xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "gohberg and feldman @xcite were the first to obtain conditions for the applicability of the method for some classes of continuous symbol convolution operators on @xmath30 , and kozak @xcite introduced the algebraic approach .",
    "another important early milestone for tackling piecewise continuous generating functions was silbermann s paper @xcite where he found a compact - like ideal of sequences and a corresponding snapshot , so that the stability problem could be decomposed into the invertibility of the snapshot and invertibility of the coset in the quotient algebra .",
    "that idea has been used ever since , usually complemented by localization techniques to find invertibility conditions for the coset .    when @xmath9 is strongly convergent most proofs make use of the close relationship between strong convergence and the ideal of compact operators . in this context , the observation that the multiplication of a strongly convergent sequence by a compact operator gives uniform convergence plays a fundamental role . for non - strongly convergent projections , as it is the case for the finite section projections in @xmath128 or @xmath35 , s. roch and b. silbermann @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* et seq . ) ) initiated the idea of changing the above mentioned connection between compactness and strong convergence to a definition .",
    "starting with the projection sequence @xmath129 , one substitutes the usual compact operators by compact - like operators related to that sequence .",
    "the @xmath3-compact operators will be those operators @xmath130 such that @xmath131 and @xmath132 tend to zero as @xmath133 .",
    "this new approach with the adapted ideal of @xmath3-compact operators happens to also be useful in the cases @xmath85 , and is at the heart of the results we present . in @xcite",
    "the authors managed to use the new approach to get , besides the complete solution for the cases @xmath134 , the solution for the so - called quasi - banded operators , which include all convolutions with generating function continuous at all finite points of @xmath68 , but do not include the general piecewise continuous case .",
    "the present work purposes to bring the @xmath3-framework together with localization techniques in order to cover for the first time quasi - banded operators and operators of convolution with piecewise continuous generating functions .",

    "@xmath142 for every finite subset @xmath143 .",
    "although these conditions seem to be somewhat technical at a first glance , they actually have a very natural meaning : the projections are nested ( 1 . ) , cover the whole space ( 2 . ) , and provide a uniformly bounded partition ( 3 . ) , in a sense .",
    "therefore @xmath3 is said to be a _",
    "uniform approximate identity_. for a rigorous treatment ( in an even more relaxed setup ) we refer to @xcite .",
    "in fact , recall from @xcite that the set @xmath144 of all _ @xmath3-compact operators _ is a banach algebra .",

    "therefore one may also equivalently define that @xmath12 is @xmath3-fredholm if @xmath151 is invertible in the quotient algebra @xmath152 .",
