    "<S> we analyze the relation between the entanglement and spin - squeezing parameter in the two - atom dicke model and identify the source of the discrepancy recently reported by banerjee and zhou that one can observe entanglement without spin squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations demonstrate that there are two criteria for entanglement , one associated with the two - photon coherences that create two - photon entangled states , and the other associated with populations of the collective states . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the spin - squeezing parameter correctly predicts entanglement in the two - atom dicke system only if it is associated with two - photon entangled states , but fails to predict entanglement when it is associated with the entangled symmetric state . </S>",
    "<S> this explicitly identifies the source of the discrepancy and explains why the system can be entangled without spin - squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate these findings in three examples of the interaction of the system with thermal , classical squeezed vacuum and quantum squeezed vacuum fields .    </S>",
    "<S> entanglement , the most intriguing property of multiparticle systems ( or qubits ) , is one of the key problems in quantum physics and has been the subject of active research in recent years  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it describes a multiparticle system which has the astonishing property that the results of a measurement on one particle can not be specified independently of the results of measurements on the other particles . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the generation of entanglement between atoms is fundamental not only to demonstrate quantum nonlocality but also would constitute a valuable resource in the fields of quantum information processing , cryptography and quantum computation  @xcite . in this context , it is not surprising that a tremendous number of theoretical proposals have been made to produce entanglement between separate particles  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several different criteria have been proposed to identify entanglement in two - particle systems , but no definite measure of entanglement exists for a number of particles larger than two . </S>",
    "<S> entanglement between two particles can be identified by calculating , for example , the wootters entanglement measure ( concurrence )  @xcite , or a measure proposed by peres  @xcite and horodecki  @xcite given in terms of the negative eigenvalues of the partial transposition of the density matrix of the two - particle system . </S>",
    "<S> recently , srensen  @xcite have proposed a measure of multiparticle entanglement in terms of the spin - squeezing parameter  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of particles , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are three mutually orthogonal unit vectors oriented such that the mean value of one of the spin components , say @xmath4 , is different from zero , while the other components @xmath5 and @xmath6 have zero mean values . </S>",
    "<S> the variance @xmath7 should be calculated in the plane orthogonal to the mean spin direction . </S>",
    "<S> a multiatom system in a coherent state has variances normal to the mean spin direction equal to the standard quantum limit of @xmath8 . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 . a system with the variance reduced below the standard quantum limit in one direction normal to the mean spin direction </S>",
    "<S> is characterized by @xmath10 , that is spin squeezed in the direction @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> srensen  @xcite have shown that multiparticle spin squeezed systems also exhibit entanglement .    </S>",
    "<S> however , in recent studies of entanglement in the two - atom dicke system  @xcite it has been discovered that the spin - squeezing parameter @xmath12 is not sufficient for predicting entanglement in a multiparticle system . </S>",
    "<S> banerjee  @xcite and zhou  @xcite have shown that the two - atom dicke system driven by a single mode thermal field , can exhibit an entanglement and at the same time @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> they have found that in the thermal field the time evolution of the system is represented by a diagonal density matrix @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the collective states of the two - atom system  @xcite , and @xmath16 are the ground and excited states of the @xmath17th atom , respectively . in the dicke system </S>",
    "<S> the antisymmetric state @xmath18 is completely decoupled from the remaining states , and then the simple three - state representation of the two - atom dicke system can be applied with the ground product state @xmath19 , the excited product state @xmath20 and the maximally entangled symmetric state @xmath21 . since the density matrix of the system is diagonal and the symmetric state @xmath21 is a maximally entangled state , an entanglement can be produced in the dicke system by a suitable population of the state @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this is exactly the situation considered by banerjee  @xcite and zhou  @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we clarify the discrepancy between entanglement and the spin - squeezing parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath12 has been proposed as a simple and robust method to identify entanglement of a large number of atoms , so we believe that a detailed analysis of the discrepancy is of general interest . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the two - atom dicke model , the parameter @xmath12 correctly predicts entanglement only if the system is in the two - photon entangled states which are linear superpositions of the collective ground state @xmath19 and the upper state @xmath20 , but fails to predict entanglement if the system is in the entangled symmetric state @xmath21 .    in order to show this more quantitatively , </S>",
    "<S> we start from the definition of the parameter @xmath12 , which we can write in terms of the density matrix elements of the system as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the angle between @xmath11 and the direction of maximum squeezing . in the derivation of </S>",
    "<S> , we have used the kitagawa and ueda s  @xcite definition of @xmath24 in which the variance @xmath25 , calculated in the @xmath11 direction , is compared to the maximum spin @xmath26 in the normal @xmath3 direction . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we have assumed that the mean spin direction coincides with the @xmath27 axis and calculated the variance in the @xmath11 direction which coincides with the @xmath28 axis . </S>",
    "<S> this is not an essential feature if the system is driven by a thermal or squeezed vacuum field , since in this case the mean values @xmath29 and @xmath30 are zero for all values of the parameters involved  @xcite . in a more general case of a coherently driven atoms , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are different from zero </S>",
    "<S> , one can adjust the angle @xmath23 such that the maximum squeezing will coincide with the direction of the rotated nonzero spin components .    </S>",
    "<S> we see from that the parameter @xmath12 depends on the population @xmath31 of the entangled symmetric state and the two - photon coherence @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , spin squeezing will be produced in the direction @xmath23 when @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the spin - squeezing parameter involves the two - photon coherences with no dependence on one - photon coherences . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the spin squeezing can only be generated by two - photon processes . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the spin squeezing is inherent multi - atom effect arising from the collective evolution of the dicke system .    </S>",
    "<S> we now determine general conditions for entanglement in the two - atom dicke model using the peres - horodecki measure of entanglement given by the quantity  @xcite @xmath34 where the sum is taken over the negative eigenvalues @xmath35 of the partial transposition of the density matrix @xmath36 of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath37 corresponds to maximum entanglement between the atoms whilst @xmath38 describes completely separated atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> since the generation of the spin squeezing is independent of the one - photon coherences , we will look into conditions for entanglement which are determined by the population of the collective states and the two - photon coherences . </S>",
    "<S> note , that in the dicke model , @xmath39 . in this case , the density matrix of the system in the basis @xmath40 following the peres - horodecki criterion for entanglement , we find that the eigenvalues of the partial transposition of @xmath36 are @xmath41^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ } \\ .\\label{eq7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is obvious that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are always positive . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues @xmath44 and @xmath45 become negative if and only if @xmath46 or @xmath47 we are now in a position to understand quantitatively the discrepancy between entanglement and the spin squeezing parameter . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that there are _ two _ criteria for entanglement in the two - atom dicke model . </S>",
    "<S> the first criterion , , is associated with the two - photon coherence and population of the symmetric state . </S>",
    "<S> the second criterion , , is associated only with the populations of the collective states . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that the criterion overlaps with the criterion for spin squeezing , see . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the absence of the two - photon coherences , the two - atom system can still be entangled , in accordance with the criterion , but can not exhibit spin - squeezing , which is associated with the criterion . </S>",
    "<S> this explicitly identifies the source of the discrepancy found by banerjee  @xcite and zhou  @xcite and explains why the two - atom dicke system can be entangled without spin - squeezing .    in the situations where the criterion is satisfied </S>",
    "<S> , there are entangled states generated which can be found by the diagonalization of the density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the diagonalization leads to eigenstates @xmath48/\\left[\\left(\\pi_{+}-\\rho_{ee}\\right)^{2 } + \\left|\\rho_{eg}\\right|^{2}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\ , \\nonumber \\\\    </S>",
    "<S> \\left(\\pi_{-}-\\rho_{gg}\\right)|e\\rangle \\right]/\\left[\\left(\\pi_{-}-\\rho_{gg}\\right)^{2 } + \\left|\\rho_{eg}\\right|^{2}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\ , \\nonumber \\\\     </S>",
    "<S> diagonal probabilities @xmath49^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ \\pi_{- } & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\rho_{gg}+\\rho_{ee}\\right ) -\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\left(\\rho_{gg}-\\rho_{ee}\\right)^{2 } + 4\\left|\\rho_{eg}\\right|^{2}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\pi_{s } & = & \\rho_{ss } \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ \\pi_{a } & = & 0 \\ .\\label{eq11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is evident from , that in the presence of the two - photon coherence , the system evolves into entangled states which are linear superpositions of the collective ground state @xmath19 and the upper state @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the entangled symmetric state remains unchanged in the presence of two - photon processes . </S>",
    "<S> thus , spin squeezing and entanglement created by the two - photon coherences are both associated with the two - photon entangled states @xmath50 .    </S>",
    "<S> as an example to illustrate our findings , consider the two - atom dicke system driven by a broadband squeezed vacuum field . in the steady - state , </S>",
    "<S> nonzero matrix elements are  @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the intensity of the squeezed field and @xmath53 is the two - photon correlation function  @xcite .    for the interaction of the system with a thermal field , @xmath54 , and then using it is straightforward to prove that both criteria and are not satisfied for all values of @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the inequality @xmath55 always holds indicating that both entanglement and spin - squeezing are not present in the steady - state two - atom dicke system driven by a thermal field .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation is different when the system is driven by a classical squeezed field with the maximal two - photon correlations @xmath56 . in this case the inequality @xmath57 always holds in contradiction to . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that the inequality can be satisfied as @xmath58 . according to and </S>",
    "<S> , the criterion for both entanglement and spin squeezing can be determined by positive values of a parameter @xmath59 shows that the system driven by the classical squeezed field will exhibit entanglement and spin - squeezing when @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate these features in ( a ) , where we plot the entanglement measure @xmath61 and the squeezing parameter @xmath62 as a function of the intensity @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the figure clearly demonstrates that with the condition , the squeezing parameter correctly predicts entanglement induced by the two - photon coherences . </S>",
    "<S> we should note here that the steady - state of the system driven by a classical squeezed field is a mixed state . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the squeezing parameter correctly predicts entanglement in a mixed state if the entanglement is generated by the two - photon coherences .     </S>",
    "<S> entanglement measure @xmath61 ( solid line ) and the squeezing parameter @xmath62 ( dashed line ) as a function of the intensity @xmath52 for ( a ) classical squeezed field with @xmath63 , and ( b ) quantum squeezed field with @xmath64 . , </S>",
    "<S> width=377 ]    when the system is driven by a quantum squeezed field with perfect correlations @xmath65 , the populations of the diagonal states  ( [ eq10 ] ) are profoundly affected by the presence of the strong two - photon correlations @xmath53 such that the steady - state of the system is a pure state  @xcite . since @xmath66 , </S>",
    "<S> the criterion is not satisfied , and therefore entanglement is determined solely by the criterion which is always satisfied as @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> since the inequality @xmath67 always holds , the system exhibits entanglement and spin - squeezing for all @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is seen in ( b ) , where we show the entanglement measure @xmath61 and squeezing parameter @xmath68 for the quantum squeezed field . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the entanglement and spin squeezing are present for all @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement and spin squeezing increase with increasing @xmath52 and attain their maximal values , @xmath37 and @xmath69 , for large @xmath52 .    as we have mentioned above </S>",
    "<S> , the steady - state of the system driven by the quantum squeezed field is a pure state . </S>",
    "<S> we find from that the pure state is the entangled state given by  @xcite @xmath70 \\ .\\label{eq14}\\ ] ] the pure state is a non - maximally entangled state , and reduces to a maximally entangled state for @xmath71 .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have clarified the discrepancy between the entanglement and spin - squeezing parameter recently reported by banerjee  @xcite and zhou  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that there are two criteria for entanglement in the two - atom dicke system , one associated with the two - photon coherences and population of the symmetric state , and the other associated with populations of all the collective states . </S>",
