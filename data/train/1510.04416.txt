    "the single nucleon pick up reactions like ( p , d),(d , t ) and ( d,@xmath2he ) , the stripping reactions like ( d , p ) are the powerful tools to determine the excitation energy , spin , parity , orbital and total angular momentum and also the spectroscopic factors for single particle levels of the nuclei of interest .",
