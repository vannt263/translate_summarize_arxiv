    "when the viscous scale of the flow is much larger than the polymer length ( the typical situation ) , the turbulence appears locally as a constant strain . in the context of our model ,",
    "the polymers are stretched ellipsoids whose major axis is aligned with the dominant stretching direction , associated with the largest lyapunov exponent , positive here for an incompressible flow . this alignment is observed in numerical experiments  @xcite .",
    "we thus neglect the subdominant directions in   and write @xmath16 where  @xmath17 is the largest  @xmath18 and  @xmath19 is the lyapunov exponent associated with the dominant direction of stretching .",
    "we take  @xmath19 to be a random variable satisfying @xmath20 where the angle brackets denote a average over  @xmath19 . in general",

    "this is the same fokker ",
    "planck equation as derived by chertkov  @xcite , except that instead of diffusivity we shall use the minimum polymer size  @xmath4 as an ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "this also allows us to treat the coiled state in section  [ sec : coiled ] .",
    "we first deal with the case of relatively unstretched polymers , so that their effective radius ( the maximal extension of the ellipsoid describing the deformation of the polymers ) is much less than the maximal extension of the polymer . in that case",
    "we assume that the polymers are in a linear force response regime and we can use the hookean dumbbell model ,  . since the determinant of  @xmath3 is greater than  @xmath29 ( see the appendix ) , we can assume that the largest principal axis  @xmath17 ( the only one we model ) is larger that  @xmath4 , and assume the pdf of  @xmath17 vanishes for  .",

    "when  @xmath40 the  @xmath41 moment diverges , which means that the pdf  @xmath42 becomes unnormalizable .",
    "thus the physical picture is as follows : for large   only moments associated with large  @xmath43 diverge , but as   is lowered more moments diverge , indicating that on average more polymers have anomalously long lengths , that is , they are uncoiled . for  @xmath40 all positive ( @xmath44 ) moments are infinite , which indicates that the polymers are essentially all in a stretched ( uncoiled ) state , but also pointing to a breakdown in the theory because of the infinite moments .",
    "the combination  @xmath45 can be rewritten @xmath46 where  @xmath47 is the deborah number , the ratio of the polymer relaxation timescale over the advection timescale .",
    "the transition to the stretched state thus occurs for  .",

    "stretch transition .",
    "of course , when it becomes too large we must include nonlinear contributions to the relaxation force , the topic of the next section .",
    "as we saw in section  [ sec : coiled ] , the hookean dumbbell model fails once the deborah number reaches unity , because it can not prevent the polymers from becoming infinitely long  @xcite .",
    "one standard way to prevent this is to use the fene - p model  @xcite , for which @xmath53 the restoring force of the polymers is now such as to limit their length to  @xmath54 ( though they make break before reaching that length , as we see below ) .",
    "we assume that the elongation of the polymers is smaller than the viscous length , so that their length is limited by their own elasticity and not by the hydrodynamic mechanism of tabor and de gennes  @xcite .",
    "since in this section we are interested in the stretched state of long polymers , we may neglect   both in   and  , which leads to the stationary distribution @xmath55 unlike the distribution obtained in  @xcite , this pdf exhibits a cutoff at  @xmath54 , reflecting the fact the limited size of the polymers .",
    "we also impose a cutoff at  @xmath56 for small  @xmath17 , because  @xmath17 can not be less than the equilibrium length  @xmath4 ( see the appendix ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite diffusivity was used to regularize the pdf at small  @xmath17 , but both methods are equivalent since  @xmath4 drops out in our approximation .",

    ".   predicts zero length for the polymers , but this is just a symptom of the neglect of  @xmath4 .",
    "rather , the coiled solution of section  [ sec : coiled ] must then be used .    for @xmath51 , eq .",
    "again takes a simplified form , @xmath60 so the average polymer stress ( proportional to  @xmath61 ) is linear in the inverse deborah number .",
    "some positive ( @xmath44 ) and negative ( @xmath62 ) moments are plotted as a function of the deborah number in figs .",

    "the negative moments diverge as  @xmath47 approaches unity , a consequence of the neglect of  @xmath4 .    as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , the pdf of length can also be used to estimate the fraction of polymers that break .",
    "( this is a kind of degradation , though not the same as say for dna , where the two strands become separate  @xcite . )",
    "assume a polymer breaks if the tension  @xmath63 exceeds a critical value ,  @xmath64 .",
    "to that critical tension corresponds a critical length ,  @xmath65 , obtained by solving @xmath66 a quadratic in  @xmath65 .",
    "the fraction of polymers that survive is equal to the fraction shorter than  @xmath65 , obtained by integrating the pdf   from  @xmath67 to  @xmath65 , @xmath68 where   is the beta function , and  @xmath69 is the incomplete beta function . since  , for   none of the polymers break .",
    "the fraction of surviving polymers   is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pnobreak ] for different values of  @xmath70 . for large  @xmath70 ( small fluctations ) , the survival probability becomes a step function with `` knee '' at  @xmath71 : either all polymers survive or all are broken .",
    "a consequence of   is that a significant fraction of polymers can survive even for large deborah number ; for   ( ) and  , , which is not small if  @xmath70 is not too large . in other words , some polymers survive breakage for large  @xmath2 if the fluctuations in  @xmath2 ( given by  @xmath72 ) are also large . of course",
    ", this treatment is for one correlation time of the turbulence . in reality",
    "a given polymer is likely to be exposed to many different random strains .",
    "because we have assumed the turbulence to be delta - correlated , the probability of survival of the polymers decays roughly as  @xmath73 , where   with @xmath74 the elapsed time and   the correlation time .",
    "( more generally , for smaller deborah number , take the  @xmath75th power of  . )",
    "we show that the evolution equation   for the polymers implies a lower limit on the volume of the polymer ellipsoid . that volume is proportional to  , so we let  .",
    "( we rescale  @xmath17 such that  @xmath76 . ) for small volumes ( low stretching ) the hookean approximation applies , so we let  @xmath30 in  ; the quantity  @xmath77 obeys @xmath78      the sign changes of the derivative of  @xmath77 are the same as those of  @xmath79 since the logarithm is monotonically increasing .",
    "figure  [ fig : detstab ] shows the sign of  @xmath81 in the  @xmath82@xmath83 plane , assuming  @xmath84 . without loss of generality",
    "we also assume  , so we need not consider the shaded area .",
    "the solid curve is  @xmath85 , where the determinant is constant .",
    "the dotted curves show lines of constant  @xmath79 , the dashed line being  @xmath80 .",
    "the dotted and dashed curves meet at the spherical solution . below the solid curve ,",
    "@xmath79 must increase , and above it must decrease .",
    "the line  @xmath80 lies entirely below  @xmath85 and is tangent to it at  . assuming that the polymers are initially in the spherical ( rest ) state",
    ", we see that  @xmath79 must either remain at or increase away from unity .",
    "in fact the only disturbances that do not linearly decay back to the spherical state are those along the solid line . the picture for   is three - dimensional but is qualitatively the same .",
    "we conclude that  @xmath86 , so that the volume of the ellipsoid is no smaller than the equilibrium sphere .",
    "hence , the largest polymer dimension ,  @xmath82 , is never smaller than  @xmath4 , justifying its use as a small-@xmath82 cutoff ."
