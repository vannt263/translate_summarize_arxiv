    "radio halos are diffuse radio emission that permeates clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "they are believed to be synchrotron radiation from cosmic rays ( crs ) in the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "although their surface brightness is low , they are often extended on scales of @xmath0mpc .",
    "since they are generally found in merging clusters , some phenomena associated with cluster mergers , such as shocks and turbulence in the icm , may be responsible for the acceleration of the cr particles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "while they are small in number , they are found in the cool cores of cool core clusters , which have not been disturbed by cluster mergers for a long time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their size ( @xmath1  kpc ) is small compered with ordinary radio halos .",
    "the relation between the radio luminosity and the size is less clear for the mini - halos compared with the ordinary halos @xcite , which has made it difficult to find the origin of the mini - halos .",
    "@xcite proposed that the radio synchrotron emission comes from cr electrons reaccelerated by turbulence in the icm .",
    "@xcite argue that the electrons illuminating the mini - halos are of secondary origin ; they are created through the interaction between cr protons and icm protons .",
    "@xcite also proposed that the cr protons producing the secondary electrons are accelerated at shocks around the central active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in clusters .    for cool cores",
    ", there is another mystery with the icm .",
    "the radiative cooling time of the icm in the cores is generally less than the age of the clusters , while that in the surrounding region is larger than the age . if there are no heating sources , the icm in the core should cool and can not sustain the pressure from the surrounding . in this case ,",
    "a gas flow toward the cluster centre should develop ( a cooling flow ; see @xcite ) .",

    ", crs may be accelerated around the agns .",

    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the transfer mechanisms is cr streaming @xcite , in which crs interacting with alfvn waves move outwards in the cluster .",
    "the icm is heated by the @xmath2 work of the crs .",
    "we have shown that the crs can actually heat the icm ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "the heating is fairly stable because it is not localised around the agn , and the density dependence of the heating term is globally similar to the radiative cooling term .",
    "moreover , the cr distribution is not much affected by the temporal change of the icm distribution .",
    "if cr protons are heating cores , they should produce non - thermal emissions through their interaction with the thermal protons in the icm . in that case",
    ", the radio mini - halos could be closely related to the heating of the cores .",
    "we calculated non - thermal spectra of cool cores that are heated by the cr protons ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  ii ) .",
    "we compared the results with the radio observations of the mini - halo in the perseus cluster .",
    "we found that the momentum spectrum of the crs must be steep so as to be consistent with the observations of the mini - halo .",
    "we also showed that the detection of non - thermal emissions from the crs would be difficult in the hard x - ray and gamma - ray bands , because of the steep spectrum .",
    "thus , it is desirable to find a way of studying the cr heating in more detail only in the radio band .    in this paper",
    ", we show that cr heating can be studied closely by the radial profiles of mini - halos .",
    "if the crs are stably heating a cool core , radiative cooling must be balanced with the heating at each radius .",
    "assuming they balance , we can determine the radial profile of the cr pressure using only x - ray data for a cluster .",
    "once we obtain the cr pressure profile , we can predict the radial profile of synchrotron radiation from the crs and we can compare the predicted profile with the observed one .",
    "the idea of using the balance between the radiative cooling and the cr heating has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "they considered coulomb and hadronic interactions as the cr heating .",
    "however , since it has been indicated that cr streaming is a much more effective heating source ( * ? ? ?",

    "[ sec : num ] , we check whether the cr heating is actually balanced with the radiative cooling using the results of numerical simulations . in that section",
    ", we also show that the cr heating is even more stable if the streaming velocity of the crs is the sound velocity of the icm , compared to the case where the streaming velocity is the alfvn velocity . in section  [ sec : comp ] , we predict radial profiles of mini - halos and compare them with the observations . finally , section  [ sec : conc ]",
    "is devoted to discussion and conclusions . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a @xmath3cdm cosmology with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "we consider protons as crs unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "if the heating via cr streaming is balanced with radiative cooling in a cool core , it must be @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the electron density of the icm .",
    "the heating rate of the cr streaming is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the streaming velocity of the crs , and @xmath11 is the cr pressure ( paper  i ) . in our models ,",
    "we approximate the cooling function @xmath3 by @xmath13 \\left(\\frac{t}{\\rm k}\\right)^{0.5}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + 1.39\\times 10^{-16 } \\left[0.02 + 0.1\\left(\\frac{z}{z_\\odot}\\right)^{0.8}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\left(\\frac{t}{\\rm k}\\right)^{-1.0}\\rm\\ : erg\\ : cm^3\\:,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the temperature and @xmath15 is the metal abundance of the icm .",
    "this function approximates the one derived by @xcite for @xmath16  k and @xmath17 .    from equation  ( [ eq : balance ] )",
    ", we obtain cr pressure : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the radius where @xmath11 approaches zero .",
    "since @xmath20 rapidly decreases outside the core , the integration is insensitive to the value if we assume that it is much larger than the core radius .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath21  mpc .",
    "crs move outwards as a whole in the cluster with waves that scatter the crs .",
    "if the waves are alfvn waves , the streaming velocity @xmath22 may be the alfvn velocity @xmath23 .",
    "however , it has been indicated that the cr streaming velocity may be much larger than the alfvn velocity in hot icm , because in hot plasma the alfvn waves may suffer strong resonant damping at small wave lengths by thermal protons . in this case",
    ", the sound velocity @xmath24 may be appropriate as the streaming velocity @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we mainly consider the case of @xmath25 .    in this study , we do not discuss the injection of crs into the icm in detail .",
    "they may be directly injected at shocks @xcite , or they may be transported by buoyant bubbles @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the bubbles are created through agn activities , which also accelerate crs around the bubbles .",
    "the bubbles contain the crs and carry them from the agn out to large distances .",
    "as the bubbles adiabatically rise , the crs may escape from the bubbles into the icm or they may be injected into the icm through the shredding of the bubbles by rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities . while the adiabatic expansion reduces the energies of crs , it does not change the slope of the momentum spectrum .",
    "observations have shown that the bubbles with a size of @xmath26  kpc are often found at the centre of cores , while large scale ( @xmath27  kpc ) shocks appear to be rare ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this may suggest that cr injection via bubbles is more common .",
    "although we can obtain @xmath28 from equation  ( [ eq : pc ] ) for given temperature and density distributions and the streaming velocity , we need to specify the momentum spectrum of the crs to calculate the synchrotron spectrum of the crs . for that purpose",
    ", we adopt the following spectrum : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the cr momentum , @xmath31 is the index , and @xmath32 is the cutoff momentum .    the hadronic loss of cr protons could modify the slope of the spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our case ,",
    "the escape time of crs from the core ( @xmath33@xmath34  yr ) is smaller than the cooling time via hadronic loss .",
    "thus , we ignore the modification of the spectrum by the loss .",
    "we assume that @xmath31 and @xmath32 do not depend on @xmath35 ( paper  ii ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the normalisation of the spectrum , @xmath36 , depends on @xmath35 and it is determined from the following equation for given @xmath28 : @xmath37 we determine the cutoff momentum @xmath32 assuming that the high - energy crs are accelerated at shocks formed through the activities of the central agn ( see paper  ii ) .",
    "the cutoff momentum is determined by the age of the shock , and @xmath38  tev if the energy input through an explosive activity of the agn is @xmath39  erg .",
    "although the actual acceleration mechanism is not clear ( e.g. crs may be accelerated nearby the black hole and form jets ; @xcite ) , the following results are not sensitive to @xmath40 .",
    "the minimum momentum , @xmath41 , will be set in section  [ sec : hc ] .",
    "on the other hand , as will be shown later , the synchrotron spectrum and luminosity are sensitive to the index @xmath31 .",
    "once we fix the momentum spectrum of the crs at each radius , we can calculate synchrotron and other non - thermal emissions from secondary electrons that are generated through the interaction between cr protons and icm protons , and through the decay of charged pions .",
    "we can also calculate @xmath42-decay gamma - rays .",
    "we use the radiation model of @xcite and the proton - proton collision model of @xcite ; the details are described in @xcite .",
    "before we study real clusters , we investigate whether the results of numerical simulations are well approximated by equation  ( [ eq : balance ] ) .",
    "we calculate @xmath28 based on the models in papers  i and  ii , although we make a few modifications as follows .",
    "we adopt the gravitational potential and the initial icm profile of model  lcrs in paper  ii . this model is originally constructed to reproduce the observations of the perseus cluster .",

    "we reevaluate the parameters for coulomb and hadronic losses of cr protons .",
    "this is because although we found that the index must be large ( @xmath43 ) in paper  ii , the model we used to obtain @xmath28 in paper  ii did not include the effect .",

    "we have shown that the cr heating is locally unstable with these parameters ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) if the streaming velocity is the alfvn velocity and if thermal conduction is not included , because the heating is too strong and too centrally concentrated ( paper  i ) .",

    "the density of crs nearly follows @xmath97 , or @xmath98 .",
    "this is because of the continuity , almost constant sound velocity ( streaming velocity ) , and inefficient cooling in the outer region of the cluster .",

    "figure  [ fig : com ] is the same as figure  [ fig : sou]a ( perseus ) but for @xmath106 ( figure  [ fig : com]a ) and for a reduced magnetic field strength ( figure  [ fig : com]b ) . in general , the alfvn velocity is smaller than the sound velocity in the icm .",
    "thus , when @xmath106 , the escape of the crs from the core delays and @xmath11 becomes larger .",
    "accordingly , for a given spectral shape , the synchrotron emission becomes larger than that in the case of @xmath25 ( the solid line in figure  [ fig : com]a and that in figure  [ fig : sou]a ) .",
    "however , if we increase the spectral index to @xmath120 , the observations can be reproduced ( the dotted line in figure  [ fig : com]a ) .",
    "although we do not present the result in the figure , we have also studied the profile for a reduced streaming velocity ( @xmath136 ) . as is discussed in section  [ sec : struc ] , the reduced velocity increases @xmath11 . however ,",
    "the effect is not significant , and the index of @xmath137 can reproduce the observations . in figure",
    "[ fig : com]b , we present the results when we reduced the magnetic field to @xmath121 .",
    "the synchrotron emission reduces only a factor of a few for a spectral index of @xmath43 ( the solid line in figure  [ fig : com]b and that in figure  [ fig : sou]a ) .",
    "if we slightly reduce the index to @xmath122 , the observations are reproduced again ( the dotted line in figure  [ fig : com]b ) .",
    "thus , the uncertainty of magnetic fields does not much affect the results .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sp ] , we present the broad - band spectra of the six clusters when @xmath25 .",
    "we calculated non - thermal emissions from secondary electrons created through the decay of charged pions that are generated through the interaction between cr protons and icm protons .",
    "we also calculated @xmath42-decay gamma - ray emissions .",
    "we did not include non - thermal emissions from primary electrons that are directly accelerated in the icm , because we have no information on them .",
    "we adopted @xmath115 because it can fairly reproduce the radio profiles for the clusters ( figure  [ fig : sou ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sp ] shows that except for the perseus cluster , gev gamma - ray fluxes are much smaller than @xmath138 , which is the typical current upper limit set by _ fermi _ @xcite .",
    "for the perseus cluster , the contamination of the central agn increases the upper - limit to @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "because of the steep cr momentum spectra , the fluxes in the hard x - ray band and the tev gamma - ray band are small .",
    "thus , the detection in these bands would be very difficult , which is consistent with recent tev gamma - ray observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if non - thermal emissions are observed in these bands in some clusters in the future , they might come form primary electrons .",
    "-decay gamma - rays are shown by the two - dot - dashed line .",

    "we have shown that the radial profiles of radio mini - halos observed in galaxy clusters can be explained by the synchrotron emission from the crs that heat the cool cores of the clusters . in our model ,",
    "the cores are being heated via cr streaming .",
    "first , we investigated whether the cr heating is balanced with radiative cooling of the icm using numerical simulations .",
    "we assumed that the streaming velocity of the crs ( @xmath10 ) is the sound velocity of the icm ( @xmath24 ) , because it has been pointed out that it is more appropriate than alfvn velocity ( @xmath23 ) in hot icm .",
    "moreover , we found that the heating is more stable when @xmath25 than when @xmath106 .",
    "we showed that the cr heating is actually balanced with the radiative cooling inside the core , although the heating falls short of the cooling a factor of a few outside the core .    assuming that the cr heating is balanced with the cooling in the cores of six real clusters ( perseus , a1835 , a2029 , a2390 , rxj1347 , and ophiuchus ) , we estimated the radial profiles of cr pressure only from x - ray observations .",
    "the results showed that the cr pressure at the cluster centres are less than 10  % . assuming that the momentum spectra of the crs are given by a power - law and the cr streaming velocity is the sound velocity , we calculated radial profiles of the synchrotron emission from secondary electrons created through proton - proton interaction .",
    "we found that the profiles match the observations if the index of the cr momentum spectra is @xmath43 .",
    "if the cr streaming velocity is the alfvn velocity , the index must be @xmath140 to be consistent with the observations .",
    "uncertainties of magnetic fields in the icm do not much affect the results .",
    "we have compared our predictions with the observations of only six clusters , and our model has free parameters such as @xmath31 .",
    "however , if radial profiles of mini - halos are studied for many other clusters in the future , our model can be examined more extensively through the comparison with the observations .",
    "we also estimated broad - band spectra for the six clusters when @xmath141 .",
    "owing to the steep spectra , hard x - ray and gamma - ray fluxes are small , which makes it difficult to detect the non - thermal emissions from the crs in the clusters in those bands . in the radio band ,",
    "future observations of the spectral index will give us information on the momentum spectra of crs .",
    "for the perseus cluster , we have shown that our predicted index is consistent with the observations ( paper  ii ) .",
