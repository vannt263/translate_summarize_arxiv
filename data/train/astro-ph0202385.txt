    "with the arrival of ligo , and other planned gravitational radiation observatories , the nascent field of gravitational radiation astronomy is set to prosper , if there are detectable sources in the local universe .",
    "a considerable amount of effort has been directed towards identifying potential gravitational radiation sources , and the relative rate of contribution of these sources to the anticipated signals .",
    "the canonical scenario envisioned is the final coalescence of a binary neutron star system ( ns - ns ) , where the pair s orbital energy has been radiated away by gravitational waves .",
    "ns - ns  merger _ can _ produce a copious signal for ligo , if they occur at high enough a rate locally  current estimates for ligo phase i place the maximum detection radius for such an event at @xmath4  mpc or less @xcite .",
    "the merger rate of ns - ns  binaries can be estimated from observed systems @xcite , such estimates are plagued by small number statistics and possible observer biases @xcite . alternatively , the rate can be estimated from ab initio theoretical models ( see review by @xcite , also @xcite ) .",
    "a number of authors have explored binary population synthesis models , making a number of assumptions about the input physics , leading to rates consistent with observational constraints , but uncertain by 12 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "conventionally , the rates are expressed in terms of @xmath1 , the merger rate per million years per milky way - like galaxy , assuming normal rates of star formation .",
    "then the rate in the local universe is the integrated rate over the number density of galaxies , the rate per galaxy , scaled to the milky way rate , per detection volume .",
    "@xcite find a ligo i event rate of @xmath5 for ns - ns mergers within 20 mpc , assuming @xmath6 .",
    "for a given detector sensitivity , higher mass coalescences are detectable to larger volumes , with the detection distance , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 @xcite . since black holes are expected to have masses several times larger than neutron stars , and the event rate scales as @xmath9 ( for @xmath10 small compared to the size of the universe ) ,",
    "a black hole coalescence rate of order @xmath1 implies event rates 23 orders of magnitude higher .",
    "the problem of accurately estimating the coalescence rate of compact binaries can be appreciated by noting that the type ii supernovae rate in the milky way is 12 per century , implying that the rate of type ii supernova in binaries is about @xmath11 , given a 50% binarity rate .",
    "estimates of the coalescence rate are canonically close to @xmath12 per milky way .",
    "so the branching ratio for type ii supernovae to form merging systems is of the order @xmath13 .",
    "calculating the mean rate , averaged over all scenarios for coalescence , in the local universe , is hard , with small errors of assumption about the physics of stellar evolution leading to large fractional changes in the branching ratios of particular channels for mergers .",
    "theoretical models require a series of assumptions , about the mass function of high mass stars , the cut - off points for which zero age masses lead to ns or bh formation , the binary fraction and mass ratio distribution , the amount of mass loss during ( binary ) stellar evolution , and the amplitude and distribution of natal kicks .",
    "secondary assumptions , that are usually not explored in detail , include the dependence of all of the above on metallicity and environment in which the massive stars form ; and the possibility that the ns / bh cut - off , and the natal kick , may depend on stellar rotation and magnetic fields .",
    "in fact , it is not implausible that the ns / bh formation boundary is `` fuzzy '' , that there is not a sharp border in zero - age mass between stars that form neutron stars and those which form black holes .",
    "a further potential confounding effect , is that natal kicks are generally assumed to be random , but may in principle be correlated with some macroscopic property of the progenitor star , such as rotation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are two arguments against a high rate of coalescence of compact binaries : most high mass binaries become unbound during the near instantaneous mass - loss at supernova ; the second problem is that of the ` kicks ' believed to be inflicted upon the ns from an asymmetrical supernova blast . while the range of energies imparted by the kick is a subject of intense debate @xcite , the resulting velocity change is believed to be of the order @xmath14 for a @xmath15 neutron star",
    ". a properly aligned kick can allow the system to remain bound , albeit with dramatically altered orbital parameters , but a random kick is unlikely to be directed so fortuitously , with the extra energy making a bound final state even less likely .",
    "an alternative to the ns - ns  scenario is one in which both stars are of sufficient mass to end up as black holes .",
    "the minimum mass required for black hole formation is not well known , and is heavily influenced by the evolutionary history of the black hole candidate ( see @xcite ) .",
    "accretion induced spin - up of the star prior to collapse could result in a higher minimum mass threshold , while the presence of strong winds could drop the progenitor mass below the required minimum . finally , unless an unusually flat imf is assumed ( as apparently seen in certain starburst galaxies , see , for example , @xcite ) ,",
    "few of these objects will be produced in the first place .",
    "nevertheless , precursors to black hole binary systems are more likely to survive both supernovae due to the smaller fractional mass loss during the event . depending upon the mass of the star ,",
    "a significant amount of material can fall back upon it just after the blast .",
    "indeed , a sufficiently massive progenitor may not undergo a supernova at all , reaching a point where nearly all of the material is quickly reabsorbed @xcite . after losing a significant fraction of mass to stellar winds and ( possibly ) two supernovae ,",
    "a typical bound binary system will have expanded considerably , with most @xmath16 days .",
    "long - period systems do not decay in less than a hubble time from gravitational radiation , and hence will never reach a frequency range useful to ligo .",
    "however , including asymmetric supernova kicks changes the picture significantly .",
    "assuming that the total momentum change is approximately the same for all supernovae , the velocity imparted to the nascent black hole will be scaled to its mass , via @xmath17 ( see grishchuk et al 2001 for review ) . for a typical @xmath18 hole , this gives a kick of the order @xmath19 , comparable to or larger than the orbital speed , but not so large as to always rip the system apart .",
    "systems that remain bound are generally in highly eccentric orbits , which expedites their merger through emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "ultimately , the point is this : the trace of the metric perturbation from gravitational waves , varies as @xmath20 . as the maximum detection radius scales linearly with @xmath21 , the maximum search volume scales as @xmath22 .",
    "the implied several hundred - fold increase in search volume means that , even if only a small fraction of these systems can merge in @xmath23 , they may dominate the detected signal .",
    "our approach is to concentrate on estimating the event rate from one particular coalescence channel .",
    "the total branching ratio for coalescence is of course the sum of all possible channels , and it is possible that other channels contribute significantly to the event rate , possibly dominating the total rate ; for example , dynamical evolution of cluster binaries may create new channels for merger with high coalescence rates @xcite , or accretion induced collapse of neutron stars with soft cores may lead to enhanced rates @xcite . here , rather than trying to estimate the total event rate , we make an observationally motivated estimate of the rate for one particular channel .",
    "nova sco 1994 ( gro j1655 - 40 ) is a strong candidate for being a black hole binary @xcite , with the primary being a @xmath24 black hole @xcite .",
    "perhaps its most remarkable feature is an unusually high space velocity , whose lower limit of 106 was , until recently , several times greater than any other known black hole transient @xcite .",
    "the likely true space velocity is greater by a factor of @xmath25 , adjusting for mean projection effects .",
    "a number of scenarios have been put forward to explain the unusual speed of nova sco .",
    "@xcite point out that the momentum component of nova sco along the line of sight is comparable to that of a single @xmath26 neutron star , having received a natal kick in the range 300700 .",
    "this is not an unreasonable value for a neutron star kick @xcite , and so lends strength to the possibility that nova sco can be explained by the primary experiencing a natal kick prior to formation of the black hole .",
    "invoking blaauw - boersma kicks @xcite as the sole acceleration mechanism invites difficulty , as the low mass of the secondary means that most blaauw - boersma kicks strong enough to give the observed speed would also disrupt the binary system completely @xcite .",
    "this is not to say that such a scenario is impossible ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the space velocity measurement of the x - ray nova xte j1118 + 480 has provided a further example of a black hole binary with a high - velocity galactic - halo orbit .",
    "@xcite used the vlba to obtain a precise proper motion for the system , calculating a speed of 145@xmath27 , with respect to the local standard of rest .",
    "the system primary has a mass function of 6.0@xmath28m@xmath29 @xcite , with a faint ( @xmath30mag ) optical counterpart . to accelerate this system to the observed peculiar velocity using blaauw - boersma kicks alone",
    ", roughly 40 m@xmath29 of material would have to be expelled during stellar collapse , an implausibly large amount of matter .",
    "this issue remains contentious , however , as calculations in @xcite show that the velocity of nova sco , at least , might be explained by a symmetric supernova where the black hole progenitor lost more than half of its mass .",
    "this is marginally possible , but becomes much more tenuous if nova sco turns out to have a significant transverse velocity .",
    "one principal difficulty with the natal kick premise is arranging for sufficient neutrinos to drive a supernova explosion prior to being trapped by the formation of an event horizon , ejecting neutrinos or other material asymmetrically .",
    "few neutrinos escape if the horizon forms over the dynamical time of the collapsing core @xcite .",
    "the drop in the resulting neutrino heating of the envelope allows most or all of the envelope to fall back onto the nascent black hole ( see , for example , the hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite ) , hence preventing the supernova . however , there is now strong evidence that a supernova must have taken place in the nova sco system , from estimates of metal abundances in the atmosphere of the secondary star .",
    "@xcite show that the secondary , an f3f8 iv / iii star , possesses a dramatic enhancement ( factors of six to ten ) in @xmath31 elements such as oxygen , magnesium , silicon and sulfur ( and see also the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , no significant enhancement in iron was found .",
    "the implication is that the progenitor of the black hole did experience a supernova during its formation , and a significant amount of the former atmosphere was captured by its companion . as most of the iron core went on to collapse to a singularity , no enhancement of this particular element is seen .",
    "the question is then how long after the supernova it took for the black hole to form .",
    "one possibility is that the star , at the instant of the supernova , experienced sufficient rotational support to avoid collapse for an extended period of time , until spin - down allowed the system to collapse to a black hole some time later .",
    "another possible scenario has some of the material cast off in the supernova explosion recaptured by the newly - formed neutron star , elevating its mass above the threshold for collapse . in either case ,",
    "a supernova is seen , with a corresponding asymmetric natal kick .",
    "more massive progenitors would form a horizon directly , with no possibility for a kick .",
    "we discuss limits for this behaviour in the next section .",
    "nova sco 1994 and xte j1118 + 480 provide strong evidence that black holes do , in fact , experience natal asymmetric kicks , at least under some conditions .",
    "the resulting orbital eccentricities tend to accelerate binary coalescence from the enhanced radiation emitted at every periastron passage .",
    "we make use of a binary evolution code developed by @xcite , and modified for use in ns - ns  systems by @xcite .",
    "our extension of the code allows for evolution to the black hole state , with assumptions about the mass function of such objects at the time of collapse .    initially , the code chooses the mass of the primary from a given mass function . for this work ,",
    "we have chosen two power law imfs , with indices @xmath31 of @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( the latter , of course , being the salpeter imf ) . in both cases , we established a lower cutoff of @xmath34  m@xmath29 , confining the code to an interesting range of initial masses ; i.  e. , where at least one supernova is possible .",
    "our primary stellar models are taken from @xcite .",
    "the helium star models used are a mix of models from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assume that the mass ratio distribution between the two components is flat .",
    "after choosing an initial separation @xmath35 and eccentricity @xmath36 after @xcite , the code evolves each binary system until both components have reached their final degenerate form , accounting for mass - transfer - induced stellar regeneration and stellar winds . during the common - envelope phase ,",
    "the orbit is circularised , and the orbital energy is reduced by the binding energy of the envelope divided by the common - envelope efficiency parameter , which we take to be 0.5 .",
    "in other words , the orbital energy is reduced by twice the envelope binding energy .",
    "neutron stars are formed from progenitors with zams masses of between 8 and 20 m@xmath29 , inclusive , and are always given a mass of 1.4 @xmath37 .",
    "more massive stars end up as black holes . as noted in the _ introduction",
    "_ , this boundary is likely to be `` fuzzy '' , i.e. , not a monotonic function of the progenitor mass , as it is strongly coupled to the spin state of the star prior to collapse , a quantity which our code simply does not track . even assuming this was known to perfect accuracy",
    ", it is far from trivial to estimate the effects of magnetic field and rotational support vis - a - vis the compact object s end state",
    ".    the black hole mass function ( i.  e. , the post - collapse mass of a bh , given its mass just prior to the explosion ) is highly speculative at this point , and is almost certainly not merely a function of initial mass , but also of angular momentum , to the extent that this determines the fraction of material falling back onto the collapsing star . in order to experience a kick ,",
    "the black holes formation must be delayed somewhat , either from rotational support , or because event horizon formation occurs only after delayed fallback of mass initially ejected from the core .",
    "@xcite has performed core - collapse simulations in order to explore the critical mass for black hole formation , and their final masses . as a best working guess",
    ", we have constructed a mass relation from a quadratic fit to the limited data set found in @xcite .",
    "the mass of the black hole at formation ( @xmath38 ) is related to the zams mass of the progenitor ( @xmath39 ) by @xmath40 .",
    "we have also chosen a simple criterion for whether a black hole will receive an asymmetric neutrino kick during collapse ; namely , all objects below 40 m@xmath29 ( referring to the zams mass ) experience a random kick . above this limit , objects collapse directly to a black hole , with no kick .",
    "we explore the effect of ignoring black hole kicks in the next section .    as a last step ,",
    "the results of the code are normalised to the supernova rate of the milky way , @xmath41 . here , the code produces some arbitrarily large number of complete evolutionary sequences , including a large number of supernova events . scaling all these events to the milky way snr allows us to generate event rates out of data",
    "not previously ordered in time .",
    "this effectively simulates a constant star - formation rate , where the population of merger candidates has reached a dynamic equilibrium .",
    "tables [ r6rates ] and [ r6nobhkicks ] summarize the investigation . for each imf , six simulations ( generating @xmath42 binary systems each ) were run , varying two parameters : @xmath43 , the upper limit of the imparted kick speed ( acting on a @xmath44 m@xmath29 ns ) , and @xmath45 , the dispersion in the maxwellian distribution of the kick speed .",
    "maximum kick values were chosen at 500 ( for @xmath45 = 90 and @xmath45 = 190 ) , and 1000 ( for @xmath45 = 450 ) .",
    "the inclusion of the 90 kick intensity is based upon recent observational work on the velocity distribution of pulsars by @xcite , which suggests a bi - modal kick distribution centered around @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "further discussions concerning this bi - modality can be found in @xcite .",
    "this range has been touched on in previous work @xcite , but we have looked at it specifically as a new observationally - motivated choice in kick magnitude .",
    "the following columns show the @xmath1 rate of bh - bh  , bh - ns  , ns - ns  and bh - psr  pairs generated in the sample .",
    "@xmath1 is a rate of 1 event per myr per milky way galaxy , found by scaling event rates to the estimated local supernova rate of 0.01 yr@xmath48",
    ". one must take into account that not all stars ( and hence not all supernovae ) occur in binaries ; hence a binarity fraction must be assumed , and we take that value to be 0.5 throughout ( i.  e. roughly two - thirds of supernovae occur in a binary system ) .",
    "the alternating columns show the @xmath1 of such pairs expected to coalesce through emission of gravitational radiation in less than the hubble time ( here , taken as 10  gyr ) .",
    "table [ r6rates ] details the formation and merger rates when black holes and neutron stars are given kicks as described above .",
    "table [ r6nobhkicks ] gives the relevant rates when black holes are not allowed to have asymmetric kicks of any kind ( even if below 40 m@xmath29 ) .",
    "figure [ avse ] show examples of the generated data sets . here",
    ", the separations of the bh - bh  and bh - ns  systems after the second supernova ( i.  e. , stellar evolution has ended ) are plotted against the post - mortem orbital eccentricity .",
    "dots represent systems stable against orbital decay , whilst triangles represent those systems which will undergo coalescence in less than a hubble time .",
    "figure [ bhbhhist ] shows the distribution of masses in surviving bh - bh  binaries , irrespective of whether the system is unstable to orbital decay .. a clear bifurcation in mass is seen , with the vast majority at around 56 m@xmath29 , and another , smaller concentration at roughly 35 m@xmath29 .",
    "the low end is comprised of black holes with 2040 m@xmath29 zams progenitors , which lose much of their mass through a supernova ( and hence experience a natal kick ) .",
    "the higher mass group are from more massive progenitors , and collapsed to a black hole without a supernova or the resulting kick .",
    "the histogram in figure [ chirp ] shows the  chirp  mass distribution for all bh - bh  systems that eventually merge from gravitational radiation .",
    "as the wave amplitude scales like @xmath49 , this plot , coupled with the sensitivity of the ligo detector , allows us to estimate a detection rate for bh - bh  binaries . by way of comparison ,",
    "two 1.4 @xmath37 objects produce a chirp mass of 1.22 @xmath37 .    as can be seen from column 8 in tables [ r6rates ] and [ r6nobhkicks ] ,",
    "most ns - ns  pairs that remain intact coalesce in @xmath50 , irrespective of imf and kick strength .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , since ns - ns  systems must generally be tightly bound to remain intact through the second supernova . for ns - ns  systems , we estimate the galactic merger rate to range from @xmath510.048 myr@xmath48 , with a strong dependence on the severity of the natal kick .",
    "given a likely ligo i detection radius of @xmath52  mpc for such systems , this would imply a conservative detection rate of 0.013 @xmath53yr@xmath48 @xcite , with a likely mean rate of @xmath5110@xmath54 yr@xmath48 .",
    "these estimates are an order of magnitude lower than those stated in @xcite .",
    "a more unexpected result was the relative frequency of bh - ns  pairs relative to bound ns systems .",
    "while far fewer bh - ns  systems are formed , their mass allows them to weather two supernovae more frequently than two neutron stars . from an estimate of the bh - ns  formation rate",
    ", we can say something about the expected frequency of bh - psr  systems . for purposes of discussion , we divide these systems into three categories , based on formation mechanism . the first type results from the standard scenario : a massive black hole forms first , with a regular short - lived pulsar at a later epoch .",
    "the second possibility is that the black hole progenitor transfers a substantial amount of matter on to the neutron star progenitor early in the evolution of the system .",
    "this results in the neutron star forming _ first _ , and allows the black hole progenitor to continue to spill matter through its roche lobe on to the slowing pulsar , thereby recycling it .",
    "the last possibility is that the system from scenario two is disrupted by the black hole formation , resulting in a ( possibly recycled ) pulsar and single black hole .",
    "this channel is not relevant for our purposes , as it ceases to be a potential ligo source .",
    "the @xmath1 rates for the remaining formation channels are shown in tables [ r6rates ] and [ r6nobhkicks ] .",
    "the bh - ns  column covers all formation channels for a bh - ns  system , whereas the bh ",
    "psr@xmath55 column considers only that subset of bh - ns  systems where a recycled pulsar is formed first , via channel two , as described above .",
    "surprisingly , of the systems that go on to form a bh - ns  pair , around 40% experience the reversal described in case two above , where the initially more massive star forms a compact object last .",
    "only 0.5% of the bh - bh  progenitor systems experience a similar reversal . in the first case , an ordinary , short - lived ( @xmath56 yr ) pulsar",
    "is created . in the latter , a fast",
    ", long - lived ( @xmath57 yr ) millisecond pulsar should often be the result .",
    "it is likely that type ii bh - psr  systems with recycled pulsars would be observable as radio objects .",
    "the small predicted formation rate of such objects , however , is consistent with having not yet been seen among known pulsars .",
    "however , their formation rate , while 3060 times smaller than that of `` type 1 '' bh - ns  systems , should mean that they are considerably more common than black holes with normal pulsar companions , being longer - lived .",
    "also , we note that the formation rate of `` type 2 '' bh - psr  systems is more severely affected by kick intensity , as strong kicks may widen the system enough to prevent mass transfer on to the neutron star , leaving an ordinary bh - psr  system .",
    "we conclude that the galactic scale height for such systems should be substantially smaller than that of ordinary bh - ns  and bh - psr  systems .",
    "further details of the bh - psr  systems ( including a prediction of orbital distributions ) will be deferred to a future work ( sipior & sigurdsson , in prep ) . note finally that the chirp mass of a typical coalescing bh - psr  system is roughly twice as large as a ns - ns  binary .",
    "as @xmath10 scales with @xmath58 , this implies at least a five - fold increase in search volume .",
    "adjusting the estimated @xmath1 rates for this implies that bh - ns  coalescence should be seen with substantially greater frequency than ns - ns  binaries at all kick intensities , with a conservative maximum of @xmath59 ligo i detections per year for low kick strengths .",
    "a more likely `` best bet '' rate is on the order of 23@xmath53 yr@xmath48 , with a mix of high ( @xmath60 ) and low ( @xmath61 ) kick velocities , with 60% of kicks drawn from the former , the balance from the latter ( as suggested by @xcite ) .",
    "bh - bh  systems are shown here to be far more common than either ns - ns  or bh - ns  hybrids .",
    "only a small fraction of these will merge in a hubble time , as the larger mass permits the system to remain bound at higher separations .",
    "as well , the greater mass of bh - bh  systems implies a more gradual response to an increasing kick parameter .",
    "indeed , the @xmath1 rate for bound bh - bh  system formation remains high ( more than thirty per myr in the milky way ) , even when kicks are permitted to reach @xmath62 on a 1.4 m@xmath29 object .",
    "figure [ chirp ] shows the distribution of chirp masses for all bh - bh  systems that coalesce in less than 10 gyr .",
    "as can be seen , there is a concentration of chirp masses around 4 m@xmath29 , implying a twentyfive - fold increase in search volume . allowing for this",
    ", we anticipate a ligo i detection rate of 0.312@xmath53 yr@xmath48 , with a likely rate of 34@xmath53 @xmath63 , given the two - component kick speed distribution described above .",
    "figure [ tvsv ] shows the strong correlation between the final system velocity ( a function of the kick magnitude and component masses ) , and the time required for the system to coalesce due to emitted gravitational wave energy . a clear dynamic criterion for coalescence emerges , with slower systems rarely merging in a hubble time .",
    "this is essentially a selection effect , as the kick speed must be of a magnitude comparable to the orbital speed of the system to have a dramatic effect on the merger rate . relative to the orbital speed , a weak kick will have no appreciable effect , while a strong kick will disrupt the system .",
    "so , the kick speeds that bring about more rapid mergers are necessarily tuned to the orbital speed of the system at the second supernova .",
    "we claim a `` best guess '' ligo i detection rate of 34 @xmath53yr@xmath48 for bh - bh  coalescence events , 23@xmath53 yr@xmath48 for bh - ns  events , and @xmath5110@xmath54 ns - ns  coalescence per year .",
    "ligo ii , with an anticipated order of magnitude increase in sensitivity , should encompass roughly @xmath62 times the search volume , with a proportional increase in event detection rates . unless ligo i is quite lucky",
    ", it seems unlikely that mergers _ from this channel _ will be detected until the advent of ligo ii in a few years .",
    "with ligo ii , we can anticipate an event rate of many per year .",
    "these are essentially consistent with the most pessimistic detection rates calculated by @xcite .",
    "there are significant differences between our results and those in @xcite , primarily regarding bh - bh  coalescence , where a negligible merger rate was found .",
    "this discrepancy is likely due to our lower cutoff for black hole formation , where we adopt a value of 20 m@xmath29 , against the 40 m@xmath29 cutoff adopted by the latter .",
    "while recent models of @xcite have established a lower black hole mass cutoff , more work is needed to resolve this area of contention .",
    "ligo - measured coalescence rates should provide a clearer resolution on this point .",
    "it is instructive to compare our results with those obtained in two recent population synthesis studies .",
    "@xcite performed detailed synthesis calculations in the context of black hole - accretion driven gamma ray bursts . as a result ,",
    "bh - bh  binaries are not considered ; however , bh - ns  and ns - ns  systems are . for the salpeter imf , and",
    "a gaussian kick distribution peaked at 100 , fwhm of 50 ( roughly corresponding to our @xmath64 kicks ) , the @xmath1 rate of bh - ns  formation is identical ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "we predict many more ns - ns  ( @xmath1 of 11 , as opposed to 4.2 ) .",
    "this discrepancy arises from the inclusion of hypercritical accretion in @xcite scenario i for ns - ns  formation .",
    "the result is that all neutron stars that pass through a common envelope phase become black holes , removing a significant channel of ns - ns  pair formation . at higher kick intensities ,",
    "the bh - ns  formation rates remain in good agreement , whilst the ns - ns  rates become more disparate .",
    "this is likely because the two high speed kick distributions are not the same , and the discrepancy affects bh - ns  systems less dramatically because of the larger mass involved .",
    "very recently , the paper of @xcite performed a similar comprehensive study , considering a wide variety of kick paradigms and population synthesis models .",
    "our anticipated ligo i detection rates are consistently an order of magnitude lower than those reported by the authors for their `` standard model '' .",
    "though the kick distribution chosen for this standard model is more intense than in our own work ( two maxwellian distributions , with @xmath45 = 175 and @xmath45 = 700 , with 80% of kicks drawn from the former , and the balance from the latter distribution ) , the mean neutron star mass is allowed to be much higher ( up to 3 m@xmath29 , allowing more systems to remain bound , _ and _ shed gravitational radiation more quickly .",
    "thus , the overall effect is to enhance the anticipated ns - ns  and bh - ns  merger rates .",
    "it should be noted that our calculated merger rates fall within the range of merger rates calculated by @xcite when all posited model assumptions are considered .",
    "the difference between our results and the standard model of the authors for bh - bh  systems is larger , by roughly two orders of magnitude ( though our results still fall within the wider range resulting from considering all the models presented ) .",
    "our model assumptions are greatly discrepant at one point in particular ; namely , the assumed mass function of newly - formed black holes as a function of zams mass . where we take a rough interpolation between model results presented in @xcite , the authors use a much more sophisticated relationship between the zams mass and the initial mass of the resulting black hole .",
    "this mass function tends to produce substantially more massive holes than those generated from our interpolation , and we believe this to be the principal cause of the discrepancy in merger rates for bh - bh  binaries .    after the neutron star / black hole mass cutoff , the second pivotal assumption concerns the distribution of natal kick speeds , and indeed , whether black holes can receive kicks under any circumstances .",
    "the cases of nova sco 1994 and xte j1118 + 480 show that our natal kick assumptions are plausible .",
    "however , we suffer from a paucity of data concerning the frequency and scaling ( with respect to mass ) of black hole kicks .",
    "there is mounting evidence that neutron star kick distributions are bi - modal @xcite , allowing many more ns - ns  systems to survive and merge after the second supernova .",
    "the greater mass of black holes means that uncertainties in these distributions have less effect on the coalescence of bh - ns  and bh - bh  systems , as can be seen in table [ r6rates ] .",
    "coupling this fact with the `` residual '' merger rate one gets when black holes are not allowed natal kicks at all ( cf .",
    "table [ r6nobhkicks ] ) , we argue that the effects of uncertainty in the natal kick models will not affect the predicted @xmath1 rates of bh - bh  and bh - ns  mergers by more than factors of a few .",
    "interestingly , the large number of bh - bh  binaries which remain bound suggests that another merger channel ; namely , a merger due to hardening resulting from external dynamical perturbations @xcite .",
    "we do not quantify this effect here , but note that the extent and duration of a star - formation episode could have a notable effect on the rate at which such interactions occur .",
    "black holes experience natal kicks only when formation of the event horizon is delayed , from fallback material and/or initial spin support .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to posit a correlation between natal kicks and a high initial spin for the nascent black hole . in a bh - bh  system",
    ", the first hole is gradually spun down by interaction with the stellar wind of its companion , and will likely be a slow rotator even if it began with maximal spin .",
    "the second hole will not experience this , and should retain its high spin .",
    "we therefore predict that , for bh systems that experience natal kicks , ligo will see a slow rotating primary , with a ( generally less massive ) black hole companion with near maximal spin .",
    "if the components do not experience natal kicks , we would anticipate low spins all around , with the coalescence rate primarily determined by the wind mass loss rate and the boundary criterion for black hole formation .",
    "this spin signature is a directly testable hypothesis ",
    "ligo ii should provide a large array of high - quality sources to verify this prediction , and allow for careful testing of gravitational wave phenomenology .",
    "a similar spin correlation may be found in bh - psr  systems , with the two categories described above having different anticipated signatures .",
    "the type i systems ( black hole first , followed by standard pulsar ) should have two slow rotators , as no pulsar recycling is possible . type ii systems ( neutron star forms first , is spun up by black hole progenitor , black hole forms ) should have at least one rapid rotator , and possibly two , if the black hole is spun up during its formation , as above .",
    "these spin correlations may be demonstrated with high - s / n data from ligo ii .",
    "more will be said about the spin signatures of bh - psr  systems in an upcoming paper ( sipior & sigurdsson , in prep ) , in addition to a study of the orbital parameters of such systems , and the ratio of bh - psr  to ns - psr systems , which is relevant for new tests of general relativity , should these systems be detected .",
    "model uncertainties , especially involving the details of black hole formation , still dominate the estimates of coalescence rates to be seen by ligo .",
    "nonetheless , it is becoming clear that bh - bh  mergers form a significant channel , comparable to the rates anticipated for ns - ns  systems .",
    "while ligo i detection rates appear too small to catch any merger events from this channel , we may still be lucky enough ( at the level of a few percent ) to serendipitously catch events from this channel ( especially given incremental upgrades in the sensitivity of ligo i throughout its operational lifetime ) .",
    "ligo ii should easily see a large number of these events every year .",

    "<S> double neutron star ( ns - ns  ) binaries , analogous to the well known hulse  taylor pulsar psr  1913 + 16 @xcite , are guaranteed - to - exist sources of high frequency gravitational radiation detectable by ligo . </S>",
    "<S> there is considerable uncertainty in the estimated rate of coalescence of such systems @xcite , with conservative estimates of @xmath0 per million years per galaxy , and optimistic theoretical estimates one or more magnitude larger . </S>",
    "<S> formation rates of low - mass black hole - neutron star binaries may be higher than those of ns - ns  binaries , and may dominate the detectable ligo signal rate . </S>",
    "<S> rate estimates for such binaries are plagued by severe model uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> recent estimates suggest that bh - bh  binaries do not coalesce at significant rates despite being formed at high rates @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the enhanced coalescence rate for bh - bh  binaries due to weak asymmetric kicks during the formation of low mass black holes like nova sco @xcite , and find they may contribute significantly to the ligo signal rate , possibly dominating the phase i detectable signals if the range of bh masses for which there is significant kick is broad enough . for a standard salpeter imf , assuming mild natal kicks , we project that the @xmath1 merger rate ( the rate of mergers per million years in a milky way - like galaxy ) of bh - bh  systems is @xmath2 , smaller than that of ns - ns  systems </S>",
    "<S> . however , the higher chirp mass of these systems produces a signal nearly four times greater , on average , with a commensurate increase in search volume . </S>",

    "<S> if no mass transfer occurs between the two supernovae , both components could be spinning rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> the waveforms produced by the coalescence of such a system should produce a clear spin signature , so this hypothesis could be directly tested by ligo . </S>"
