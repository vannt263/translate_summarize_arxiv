    "in superfluid @xmath0he cooper pairing in states with spin @xmath3 and orbital momentum @xmath4 leads to multi - component order parameters and a variety of topological defects , including quantized vortex lines of many different structures @xcite .",
    "the simplest vortex structure in any superfluid is a @xmath5 phase vortex with a hard singular core , i.e. with a core of approximately coherence length @xmath6 in radius , where all order parameter components go to zero at the axis .",
    "such vortices exist in superfluid @xmath7he and in superconductors with conventional s - wave pairing . in systems with multi - component order parameters , like @xmath0he , such a simple possibility is never realized . in vortices with the lowest energy",
    "the order parameter in the core may deviate from that in the bulk , but remains finite throughout the whole core .",
    "such vortices with a hard , but non - singular core are realized in the b phase of superfluid @xmath0he .",
    "the phase diagram in the middle shows , besides the phases of @xmath0he , the transition line between the axisymmetric core in the high pressure  high temperature corner and the non - axisymmetric core in the rest of the @xmath0he - b parameter space @xcite .",
    "the plots on the left and right show the calculated core amplitudes @xmath8 of the order parameter , normalized to the value in the bulk @xcite . ]    in fact , multiple choices for the order parameter structure in the non - singular core are possible .",
    "@xmath0he - b was the first system where a transition between two different core structures was found experimentally @xcite . as seen in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ diagr ] , vortices , which are stable in @xmath0he - b at temperatures above about @xmath9 and pressures above about 15bar , possess axisymmetric cores , like vortices in most other known systems . in vortices , which are stable at lower pressures or temperatures ,",
    "the axial symmetry is broken .",
    "each such vortex can be viewed as a bound pair of two half - quantum vortices .",
    "superfluid coherence is preserved across the whole volume when vortices with non - singular cores are present .",
    "the rigidity of the order parameter ( supported by the gradient energy ) leads to a smooth variation of the order parameter across the sample , which is called a texture . in bulk @xmath0he - b in a magnetic field",
    "@xmath10 the order parameter has the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the superfluid phase , @xmath13 is the uniaxial gap matrix in a magnetically distorted b phase and @xmath14 is the matrix of rotation around the axis @xmath15 by the angle @xmath16 which characterizes the broken relative spin - orbit symmetry .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction fixes @xmath16 at the value @xmath17 .",
    "thus the texture is essentially formed by the spatial variation of the unit vector @xmath15 .",

    "the latter contribution is of special interest since it depends on the vortex core structure .",
    "the step - like change in @xmath34 was in fact the first experimental signature of the transition in the vortex core @xcite .",
    "the cores of @xmath0he - b vortices have broken parity , which leads to a gyromagnetic effect : the value of @xmath34 depends on the orientation of the vortices with respect to the magnetic field direction : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the gyromagnetic parameter , the plus sign refers to vortices with their circulation oriented along the magnetic field and the minus sign is for the opposite orientation . both @xmath37 and @xmath38 change at the core transition @xcite .    in this work the previous measurements of @xmath28 at @xmath39 @xcite , have been extended to below @xmath40 .",

    "the discontinuity at @xmath9 signifies the first order transition in the vortex core structure .",

    "the solid line is a theoretical estimation from ref .",

    "the theoretical curve also captures the overall trend and magnitude of @xmath31 well .",
    "our data points exhibit rather large scatter .",
    "one possible cause for this scatter is the remaining disorder in the vortex cluster , when it is prepared at low temperatures . as explained in the next section , when vortex lines are not all perfectly aligned with the rotation axis , the effective value of @xmath28 ( determined by the average effect of all vortex lines ) may change . at low temperatures",
    "vortex formation proceeds typically through instabilities and interactions of the existing vortices , often in a localized turbulent burst @xcite .",
    "the vortex configuration created in such a process is far from the equilibrium one and its relaxation to the equilibrium state is impeded by the existence of many local energy minima in the vortex configurations .",
    "in addition the small value of the dissipative mutual friction parameter at low temperatures slows down the relaxation .",
    "one way to avoid such problems would be to prepare the vortex cluster at higher temperatures ( above @xmath97 ) and cool it down in rotation to low temperatures before doing the measurement .",
    "such measurements would require more time .",
    "additionally in this way there is a chance to miss a transition in vortex core structure , if it is of first order and can be substantially supercooled .    the flow - related contribution to @xmath28 drops exponentially to zero as the temperature decreases since the superfluid density anisotropy vanishes at @xmath98 .",
    "thus the finite value of @xmath28 in the @xmath99 limit signifies the contribution from the vortex cores . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ flambda ] , indeed the measured values of @xmath31 approach a constant in the @xmath99 limit , which is different for the two vortex orientations . to demonstrate this more clearly we plot in fig .",

    "the average difference between @xmath31 for these orientations , i.e. @xmath103 , is found to be @xmath104s / rad .",
    "this difference should increase with decreasing magnetic field inversely proportional to @xmath105 .",
    "thus we can conclude that at about twice smaller magnetic field than used in the present experiment , the value of @xmath28 for @xmath106 orientation will become negative in @xmath107 limit .",
    "in fact , the measurements in fig .  [ flambda ]",
    "are done for two slightly different magnetic field magnitudes , but within the scatter the field dependence of @xmath28 is not observed .    an interesting question , which measurements of @xmath28 can answer , is whether on the way to zero temperature there are more transitions in the vortex core structure .",
    "the core of the low - temperature vortex still possesses 2-fold symmetry which in principle can be broken in other phase transitions .",
    "however , in our measurements we have not found clearly identifiable jumps in the temperature dependence of @xmath28 with an associated hysteresis which would indicate possible transitions in the vortex core structure .",
    "finally we note that the core contribution to @xmath28 should in fact have some temperature dependence in the @xmath107 limit owing to the existence of bound fermion states in the vortex core @xcite .",
    "the effect of the core - bound quasiparticles on @xmath28 has not been considered theoretically so far . from general principles",
    "this contribution should have a power - law temperature dependence ( most probably @xmath108 @xcite ) , since even the lowest experimental temperatures are much larger than the so - called minigap , the spacing between levels of the bound fermion states .",
    "this is unlike the situation in the bulk , where @xmath109 and the flow contribution to @xmath28 freezes out fast , as @xmath110 .",
    "thus the contributions from the core - bound quasiparticles is expected to dominate the temperature dependence of @xmath28 in the @xmath107 limit . to observe it , though , one has to improve the accuracy of measurements from that in fig .",
    "[ lamdiff ] .",
    "one possible improvement is to repeat the measurements at zero pressure .",
    "since the size of the vortex core increases towards lower pressure , the magnitude of the vortex core contribution to textural energy should increase .",

    "one can make @xmath111 to be almost zero which would require the vortex line length in the horizontal plane to be comparable with the line length along the rotation axis .",
    "unfortunately it is impossible to determine the exact vortex configuration from the measurement of the single parameter @xmath111 .",
    "more detailed studies of the transients , when the modulation is switched on and off , can in principle provide additional information .",
    "the spin - wave resonance peaks in the cw nmr absorption spectrum of @xmath0he - b provide sensitive probes of the order - parameter texture and useful tools to determine textural parameters .",
    "previously they were used at temperatures above @xmath96 to measure , for example , the dipolar coherence length @xmath58 and the textural energy parameter @xmath28 for vortices . recently a non - linear modification of such spin waves or , in alternative language , a bose - einstein condensate of magnons in a trap , created by the order - parameter texture , was discovered at low temperatures .",
    "we used this novel precessing state to extend the measurement of @xmath28 from @xmath83 to below @xmath40 .",
    "earlier information on @xmath28 in this temperature range was only available from complicated and less reliable analysis of the overall shape of the linear nmr absorption spectrum .",
    "we found that the main temperature dependence of @xmath28 in this temperature range comes from the flow circulating around vortex cores , in agreement with theoretical calculations .",
    "this contribution decreases exponentially to zero , when the temperature approaches zero .",
    "thus from the measurements at the lowest temperatures the vortex core contribution to @xmath28 can be determined . the gyromagnetic effect , i.e. the difference between the values of @xmath28 for vortices parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field , is clearly observed in the whole temperature range studied .",
    "no sign of another transition in the vortex core structure was found ( in addition to the axial symmetry breaking at @xmath9 ) .",

    "<S> vortex lines affect the spatial order - parameter distribution in superfluid @xmath0he - b owing to superflow circulating around vortex cores and due to the interaction of the order parameter in the core and in the bulk as a result of superfluid coherence over the whole volume . </S>",
    "<S> the step - like change of the latter contribution at @xmath1 ( at a pressure of 29bar ) signifies the transition from axisymmetric cores at higher temperatures to broken - symmetry cores at lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we extended earlier measurements of the core contribution to temperatures below @xmath2 , in particular searching for a possible new core transition to lower symmetries . as a measuring tool we track the energy levels of magnon condensate states in a trap formed by the order - parameter texture </S>"
