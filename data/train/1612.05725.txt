    "modern cosmology has already entered a precise , data - driven era . in 1998 ,",
    "the elegant discovery that the universe is undergoing the phase of accelerated expansion @xcite , has motivated a great deal of studies concentrated on how best to parameterize the dark energy and measure its properties .",
    "an accompanying task comes naturally into being , i.e. , explore the corresponding behaviors at astrophysical scales when investigating the expansion history of the universe for different cosmological theories at cosmological scales .",
    "recently , because of the discovery of the accelerating universe , theorists have gradually paid more and more attention to the exotic spacetime configurations , especially , the renewed field  wormholes . to be more concrete , in both cases ( accelerating universe and wormholes ) the null energy condition ( nec ) is violated and consequently all of other energy conditions .",
    "thus , an appealing overlap between two seemingly separated subjects occurs .",
    "so far , there is no doubt that together with black holes , white dwarfs , pulsars and quasars , etc .",
    ", wormholes constituting the most intriguing celestial bodies may provide a new window for physical discovery .    in the literature ,",
    "all the authors almost study the wormhole solutions only for a given dark energy model .",
    "however , with booming astronomical data , one can investigate better the wormhole spacetime configurations supported by cosmological observations through implementing highly precise constraints on a given dark energy model , in order to avoid choosing the values of the cosmological parameters arbitrarily . in our previous works @xcite ,",
    "we have studied geometrical and holographical dark energy wormholes constrained by astrophysical observations for details , and verified that the exotic spacetime configurations wormholes can actually exist in our universe .",
    "it is worth noting that the obtained wormhole configurations are static and spherically symmetrical solutions existing at some certain low redshift .",
    "nonetheless , the previous results depend apparently on given dark energy models .",
    "hence , one shall ask whether the model - independent wormholes exist in the universe .",
    "in other words , whether can one investigate the existence of wormholes directly starting from cosmological observations ?    to answer this question , one should determine the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) @xmath2 by using the model - independent methods , in order to satisfy the requirement @xmath3 which ensures the wormhole spacetime structure open . during the past few years",
    ", there were many model - independent methods to study the evolutional behaviors of dark energy eos @xmath2 in the literature , for instance , principal component analysis ( pca ) @xcite and gaussian processes ( gp ) @xcite , etc .    in this work",
    ", we would like to use the gp method to reconstruct the dark energy eos @xmath2 and investigate the correspondingly model - independent wormhole solutions .",
    "the gp algorithm is a fully bayesian approach for smoothing data , and can preform a reconstruction of a function directly from data without assuming a parameterization of the function . as a result , one can determine any cosmological quantity from cosmic data , and the key requirement of the gp algorithm is just the covariance function which entirely depends on the cosmic data . in light of the special advantage",
    ", the gp method has been widely applied in exploring the expansion dynamics of the universe @xcite , the test of the base cosmological model @xcite , the cosmography @xcite , the distance duality relation @xcite , the determination of the interaction between dark energy and dark matter and cosmic curvature @xcite , dodging the cosmic curvature to probe the constancy of the speed of light @xcite , dodging the matter degeneracy to determine the dynamics of dark energy @xcite , the slowing down of cosmic acceleration @xcite , etc .",
    "it is noteworthy that the analysis in paper @xcite has indicated that the matrn ( @xmath4 ) covariance function is a better choice to carry out the reconstruction and it has been used in papers @xcite .",
    "the outline of the rest paper is as follows : in the next section , we make a brief review on gp method .",
    "in section iii , we reconstruct the dark energy eos @xmath2 in order to study the corresponding wormhole spacetime configurations . in section iv",
    ", we obtain two specific wormhole solutions including the cases of a constant redshift function and a linear shape function , and investigate the related physical properties .",
    "the discussions and conclusions are presented in the final section ( we use the units @xmath5 ) .",
    "in a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , the luminosity distance @xmath6 can be expressed as @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the redshift , @xmath9 the present - day value of the hubble parameter and @xmath10 the dimensionless hubble parameter , respectively .",
    "subsequently , using the normalized comoving distance @xmath11 , the dark energy eos is written as @xmath12 } , \\label{2}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to ( w.r.t ) the redshift @xmath8 and @xmath13 is present - day value of the matter density ratio parameter .",
    "to study the model - independent wormhole configurations , firstly , one needs to reconstruct the dynamic dark energy eos @xmath14 .",
    "then , as described in our previous works @xcite , one shall concentrate on the parts in which the condition @xmath15 is satisfied and study the static and spherically symmetrical wormhole solutions at some certain redshift .    the gp method can reconstruct a function directly from observational data without assuming a concrete parameterization for the function . here",
    "we utilize the package gapp ( gaussian processes in python ) @xcite to implement the reconstruction , which is firstly invented by seikel et al . for a pedagogical introduction to gp .",
    "usually , the gp is a generalization of a gaussian distribution which is the distribution of a random variable .",
    "in addition , the gp exhibits a distribution over functions . at each point @xmath16 ,",
    "the reconstructed function @xmath17 is a gaussian distribution with a mean value and gaussian error .",
    "the key of the gp method is a covariance function @xmath18 which correlates the function @xmath17 at different reconstruction points .",
    "the covariance function @xmath18 depends entirely on two hyperparameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which characterize the coherent scale of the correlation in @xmath16-direction and typical change in the @xmath21-direction , respectively .",
    "in general , the choice is the squared exponential covariance function @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "however , the analysis in @xcite has verified that the matrn ( @xmath4 ) covariance function is a better choice to carry out the reconstruction .",
    "hence , we will adopt the matrn ( @xmath4 ) covariance function in the following analysis : @xmath23 . .",
    "\\label{3}\\ ] ]    in our reconstruction , we use the union 2.1 data sets @xcite which consist of 580 sne ia data and cover the redshift range [ 0.015,1.4 ] . as noted in paper @xcite , we transform the distance modulus @xmath24 to @xmath25 in the following manner @xmath26 \\label{4}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 . furthermore , we set the initial conditions @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the reconstruction process .",
    "notice that the values of @xmath25 just depend on a combination of the absolute magnitude @xmath30 and @xmath9 .",
    "different from the previous literature @xcite , we adopt the latest 36 observational hubble parameter data ( ohd ) from the paper @xcite and the shift parameter @xmath31 from the recent planck s result @xcite as important supplements of sne ia data , since the gp algorithm in gapp does need the data of @xmath25 and @xmath32 at the same time .",
    "to be more precise , we conclude the relations between the above - mentioned data sets and the normalized comoving distance @xmath25 as follows @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the redshift of recombination and we use the values @xmath27 and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we verify the correctness of our method by using the union 2.1 data sets to run the modified code .",
    "obviously , the result in fig . [ f1 ] is consistent with that in fig .",

    "the shaded regions are reconstructions with @xmath39 and @xmath40 confidence level .",

    "[ f1 ] , and that the base cosmological model is consistent with the gp reconstructions at @xmath45 level . more precisely , the ohd data provide a tighter constraint in the low redshift range , and the planck s shift parameter gives a substantially strict high - redshift constraint avoiding the divergence in the high - redshift range of fig .",
    "therefore , we can reconstruct the dark energy eos @xmath14 better in light of the stricter constraints on @xmath44 and @xmath43 .",
    "then , according to eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , we carry out the reconstruction in fig .",

    "we find that we give a tighter constraint on @xmath14 by comparing fig .",
    "[ f3 ] with fig . 9 in paper @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we find that the base cosmological model is well compatible with our reconstruction at @xmath45 level , and that the dark energy eos @xmath14 may exhibit an oscillating behavior at @xmath46 level in the low redshift range [ 0 , 2 ] .",
    "concentrating on the parts @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , this result implies that the evolving wormhole spacetime configurations supported by cosmological observations may actually exist in the universe .",

    "@xmath48 , respectively . using the stress - energy conservation equation , @xmath69 , one can have @xmath70 which can be regarded as the relativistic euler equation or the hydrostatic equation of equilibrium for the matter threading a wormhole spacetime structure .",
