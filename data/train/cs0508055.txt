    "the last century was marked by the birth of two major scientific and engineering disciplines : silicon - based computing and the theory and technology of genetic data analysis .",
    "the research field very likely to dominate the area of scientific computing in the foreseeable future is the merger of these two disciplines , leading to unprecedented possibilities for applications in varied areas of engineering and science .",
    "the first steps toward this goal were made in 1994 , when leonard adleman @xcite solved a quite unremarkable computational problem , an instance of the directed travelling salesmen problem on a graph with seven nodes , with an exceptional method .",
    "the technique used for solving the problem was a new technological paradigm , termed dna computing .",
    "dna computing introduced the possibility of using genetic data to tackle computationally hard classes of problems that are otherwise impossible to solve using traditional computing methods .",
    "the way in which dna computers make it possible to achieve this goal is through massive parallelism of operation on nano - scale , low - power , molecular hardware and software systems .",
    "one of the major obstacles to efficient dna computing , and more generally dna storage @xcite and signal processing @xcite , is the very low reliability of single - stranded dna sequence operations .",
    "dna computing experiments require the creation of a controlled environment that allows for a set of single - stranded dna codewords to bind ( hybridize ) with their complements in an appropriate fashion .",
    "if the codewords are not carefully chosen , unwanted , or non - selective , hybridization may occur .",
    "even more detrimental is the fact that a single - stranded dna sequence may fold back onto itself , forming a secondary structure which completely inhibits the sequence from participating in the computational process .",
    "secondary structure formation is also a major bottleneck in dna storage systems .",
    "for example , it was reported in @xcite that @xmath0 of read - out attempts in a dna storage system failed due to the formation of special secondary structures called _ hairpins _ in the single - stranded dna molecules used to store information .",
    "so far , the focus of coding for dna computing was exclusively directed towards constructing large sets of dna codewords with fixed base frequencies ( constant gc - content ) and prescribed hamming / reverse - complement hamming distance .",
    "such sets of codewords are expected to result in very rare hybridization error events . as an example",
    ", it was shown in @xcite that there exist @xmath1 codewords of length @xmath2 with minimum hamming distance @xmath3 and with exactly @xmath4 /@xmath5 bases . at the same time , the wisconsin dna group , led by d.  shoemaker , reported that through extensive computer search and experimental testing , only @xmath6 sequences of length @xmath2 at hamming distance at least @xmath7 were found to be free of secondary structure at temperatures of @xmath8 . since at lower ambient temperatures the probability of secondary structure formation is even higher , it is clear that the effective number of codewords useful for dna computing is extremely small .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate properties of dna sequences that may lead to undesirable folding . our approach is based on analysis of a well - known algorithm for approximately determining dna secondary structure , called nussinov s method .",
    "this analysis allows us to extract some design criteria that yield dna sequences that are unlikely to fold undesirably .",
    "these criteria reduce to the requirement that the first few shifts of a dna codeword have the property that they do not contain watson - crick complementary matchings with the original sequence .",
    "we consider the enumeration of sequences having the shift property and provide some simple construction strategies which meet the required restrictions . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt in the literature aimed at providing a rigorous setting that links dna folding properties to constraints on the primary structure of the sequences .",
    "dna of higher species consists of two complementary chains twisted around each other to form a double helix .",
    "each chain is a linear sequence of nucleotides , or _",
    "bases_ two _ purines _ , adenine ( ) and guanine ( ) , and two _ pyrimidines _ , thymine ( ) and cytosine ( ) . the purine bases and pyrimindine bases are _ watson - crick ( wc ) complements _ of each other , in the sense that @xmath9 more specifically , in a double helix , the base  pairs with  by means of two hydrogen bonds , while  pairs with  by means of three hydrogen bonds ( i.e. the strength of the former bond is weaker than the strength of the latter ) . for dna computing purposes ,",
    "one is only concerned with single - stranded ( henceforth , _ oligonucleotide _ ) dna sequences .",
    "oligonucleotide dna sequences are formed by heating dna double helices to denaturation temperatures , at which they break down into single strands .",
    "if the temperature is subsequently reduced , oligonucleotide strands with large regions of sequence complementarity can bind back together in a process called _ hybridization_. hybridization is assumed to occur only between complementary base pairs , and lies at the core of dna computing .    as a first approximation",
    ", oligonucleotide dna sequences can be simply viewed as words over a four - letter alphabet @xmath10 , with a prescribed set of complex properties .",
    "the generic notation for such sequences will be @xmath11 , with @xmath12 indicating the length of the sequences .",
    "the wc complement @xmath13 of a dna sequence is defined as @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the wc complement of @xmath15 as given by ( [ bar_def ] ) .",
    "the _ secondary structure _ of a dna codeword @xmath16 is a set , @xmath17 , of disjoint pairings between complementary bases @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "a secondary structure is formed by a chemically active oligonucleotide sequence folding back onto itself due to _ self - hybridization _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , hybridization between complementary base pairs belonging to the same sequence . as a consequence of the bending ,",
    "elaborate spatial structures are formed , the most important components of which are loops ( including branching , internal , hairpin and bulge loops ) , stem helical regions , as well as unstructured single strands .",
    "figure  [ sec - str ] illustrates these concepts for an rna strand .",
    "it was shown experimentally that the most important factors influencing the secondary structure of a dna sequence are the number of base pairs in stem regions , the number of base pairs in a hairpin loop region as well as the number of unpaired bases .",
    "determining the exact pairings in a secondary structure of a dna sequence is a complicated task , as we shall try to explain briefly . for a system of interacting entities ,",
    "one measure commonly used for assessing the system s property is the free energy .",
    "the stability and form of a secondary configuration is usually governed by this energy , the general rule - of - thumb being that a secondary structure minimizes the free energy associated with a dna sequence .",
    "the free energy of a secondary structure is determined by the energy of its constituent pairings .",
    "now , the energy of a pairing depends on the bases involved in the pairing as well as all bases adjacent to it . adding complication is the fact that in the presence of other neighboring pairings , these energies change according to some nontrivial rules .",
    "nevertheless , some simple dynamic programming techniques can be used to _",
    "approximately _ determine the secondary structure of a dna sequence .",
    "such approximations usually have the correct form in @xmath20 of the cases considered . among these techniques , _",
    "nussinov s folding algorithm _ is the most widely used scheme @xcite .",
    "nussinov s algorithm is based on the assumption that in a dna sequence @xmath21 , the energy between a pair of bases , @xmath22 , is independent of all other pairs .",
    "for simplicity of exposition , we shall assume that @xmath23 if @xmath24 , @xmath25 if @xmath26 , and @xmath27 otherwise and @xmath28 . ] .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the minimum free energy of the subsequence @xmath30 .",
    "the independence assumption allows us to compute the minimum free energy of the sequence @xmath31 through the recursion @xmath32 where @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "the value of @xmath37 is the minimum free energy of a secondary structure of @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath39 .",
    "a very large negative value for the free energy @xmath37 of a sequence is a good indicator of the presence of stacked base pairs and loops , _",
    "i.e. _ , a secondary structure , in the physical dna sequence .",
    "nussinov s algorithm can be described in terms of free - energy tables , two of which are shown below .",
    "we first describe how such a table is filled out , after which we will point out some important properties of such tables .",
    ".free - energy table for the sequence [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in a free - energy table , the entry at position @xmath40 ( the top left position being ( 1,1 ) ) , contains the value of @xmath29 .",
    "the table is filled out by initializing the entries on the main diagonal and on the first lower sub - diagonal of the matrix to zero , and calculating the energy levels according to the recursion in .",
    "the calculations proceed successively through the upper diagonals : entries at positions @xmath41 are calculated first , followed by entries at positions @xmath42 , and so on .",
    "note that the entry at @xmath43 , depends on @xmath44 and the entries at @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "the minimum - energy secondary structure itself can be found by the _ backtracking algorithm _",
    "@xcite which retraces the steps of nussinov s algorithm .",
    "the secondary structures for the sequences in tables  [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] , shown in figures  [ sec - str1 ] and [ sec - str2 ] , have been found using the vienna rna / dna secondary structure package @xcite , which is based on the nussinov algorithm , but which uses more accurate values for the parameters @xmath22 , as well as more sophisticated prediction methods for base pairing probabilities .",
    "tables  [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] show that the minimum free energy for the sequence is @xmath50 , while that for the sequence is @xmath51 .",
    ", the sequence is deemed to have no secondary structure ; this is due to the fact that the one possible complementary base pairing , namely that of and , forms too weak a bond for the resultant structure to be stable .",
    "] this fact alone indicates that the number of paired bases in the first sequence ought to be larger than in the second one , and hence the former is more likely to have a secondary structure than the latter .",
    "more generally , one can observe the following characteristics of free - energy tables : if the first upper diagonal contains a large number of @xmath51 or @xmath28 entries , then some of these entries `` percolate '' through to the second upper diagonal , where they get possibly increased by @xmath51 or @xmath28 if complementary base pairs are present at positions @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 in the dna sequence .",
    "the values on the second diagonal , in turn , percolate through to the third diagonal , and so on .",
    "hence , the free energy of the dna sequence depends strongly on the number of non - zero values present on the first diagonal .",
    "this phenomenon was also observed experimentally in @xcite , where the free energy was modelled by a function of the form @xmath55 with @xmath56 denoting a correction factor which depends on the number of @xmath57 and @xmath58 bases in the sequence * c*. the stability of a secondary structure , as well as its melting properties can be directly inferred from  ( [ app - energy ] ) .",
    "note that under the assumption that @xmath59 for all pairings , the absolute value of the sum in  ( [ app - energy ] ) is simply the total number of pairings of complementary bases between the dna codeword * c * and the codeword shifted one position to the right or equivalently , the sum of the entries in the first upper diagonal of the free - energy table .",
    "these observations imply that a more accurate model for the free energy should be of the form @xmath60 for a correction factor @xmath56 and some non - zero weighting factors @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , the same observation implies that from the stand - point of designing dna codewords without secondary structure , it is desirable to have codewords for which the respective sums of the elements on the first several diagonals are either all zero or of some very small absolute value .",
    "this requirement can be rephrased in terms of requiring a dna sequence to satisfy a _",
    "shift property _ , in which a sequence and its first few shifts have few or no complementary base pairs at the same positions .",
    "in this section , we consider the enumeration and construction of dna sequences satisfying certain shift properties , which we shall define rigorously .                it is clear that a dna sequence is counted by @xmath81 iff it contains no pair of complementary bases",
    ". such a sequence must be over one of the alphabets @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "there are @xmath88 such sequences , since there are @xmath89 sequences over each of these alphabets , of which @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are each counted twice .",
    "let @xmath96 denote the set of all sequences @xmath75 of length @xmath12 for which @xmath78 , @xmath97 .",
    "thus , @xmath98 .",
    "note that for any @xmath99 , @xmath100}$ ] can not contain a complementary pair of bases , and hence can not contain three distinct bases .",
    "let @xmath101 denote the set of sequences @xmath102 such that @xmath103 , and let @xmath104 .",
    "we thus have @xmath105 . each sequence in @xmath101",
    "is obtained from some sequence @xmath106 by appending @xmath107 bases , @xmath108 , all equal to @xmath109 .",
    "hence , @xmath110 , and therefore , @xmath111 .",
    "now , observe that each sequence @xmath112 is obtained by appending a single base , @xmath113 , to some sequence @xmath114 .",
    "if @xmath115 is in fact in @xmath116 , then there are three choices for @xmath117 . otherwise ,",
    "if @xmath118 , there are only two possible choices for @xmath117 .",
    "hence , @xmath119 this proves the claimed result .",
    "it can be shown that for @xmath122 , the polynomial @xmath123 in the denominator of @xmath124 has a real root , @xmath125 , in the interval ( 2,3 ) , and @xmath107 other roots within the unit circle .",
    "it follows that @xmath126 for some constant @xmath127 .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath125 decreases as @xmath128 increases , and that @xmath129 .",
    "let @xmath132 be the set of length-@xmath12 dna sequences @xmath75 such that @xmath130 .",
    "a sequence @xmath133 is in @xmath132 iff the set @xmath134 has cardinality @xmath135 .",
    "so , to construct such a sequence , we first arbitrarily pick a @xmath136 and an @xmath137 , @xmath138 , which can be done in @xmath139 ways .",
    "the rest of @xmath75 is constructed recursively : for @xmath140 , set @xmath141 if @xmath142 , and pick a @xmath143 if @xmath144 .",
    "thus , there are 3 choices for each @xmath140 , @xmath144 , and hence a total of @xmath131 sequences @xmath75 in @xmath132 .        a dna code in which all codewords have the same gc - content , @xmath147 ,",
    "is called a _ constant gc - content code_. the constant gc - content constraint is introduced in order to achieve parallelized operations on dna sequences , by assuring similar thermodynamic characteristics of all codewords .",
    "the gc - content usually needs to be in the range of @xmath148 of the length of the code .",
    "the problem of constructing dna codewords obeying some form of a shift constraint can be reduced to a binary code design problem by mapping the dna alphabet onto the set of length - two binary words as follows : @xmath152    let * q * be a dna sequence .",
    "the sequence @xmath153(*q * ) obtained by applying coordinatewise the mapping given in to * q * will be called the _ binary image _ of * q*. if @xmath154 , then the subsequence @xmath155 will be referred to as the _ even subsequence _ of @xmath156 , and @xmath157 will be called the _ odd subsequence _ of @xmath153(*q * ) . the wc distance , @xmath158 , between two dna words @xmath159 can be expressed in terms of the even and odd subsequences , as stated in the lemma below . for notational",
    "ease , given binary words @xmath160 and @xmath161 , we define @xmath162 , the sum being taken modulo-2 , and @xmath163 .",
    "let * p * and * r * be two words of length @xmath12 over the alphabet @xmath164 , and define @xmath165 , @xmath166 . using @xmath167 to denote the complement of a binary sequence @xmath168 , we can express the wc distance between @xmath169 and @xmath170 as @xmath171 where @xmath172 denotes hamming weight .",
    "consequently , if for some length-@xmath12 dna sequence @xmath173 , we take @xmath174}$ ] and @xmath175}$ ] , then @xmath173 satisfies the @xmath52-th shift constraint @xmath176 iff @xmath177 [ wc - binary ]    in a companion paper @xcite , we described a sample of construction methods for dna codes which reduce undesired hybridization and alow for fully parallel dna system operation . among the constraints identified for this problem",
    "are the base runlength constraint , the constant gc - content constraint , and the hamming and reverse - complement hamming distance constraint .",
    "we will show next that it is straightforward to incorporate these hybridization constraints into a scheme which also allows for constructing sequences with reduced probability of secondary structure formation .",
    "the idea is based on the use of the non - zero codewords of cyclic simplex codes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  8) or subsets thereof . recall that a cyclic simplex code of dimension @xmath135 is a simplex code of length @xmath178 composed of the all - zeros codeword and the @xmath12 distinct cyclic shifts of any non - zero codeword .",
    "let @xmath179 be a dna code obtained by choosing the set of non - zero codewords of a cyclic simplex code of length @xmath180 for both the even and odd binary code component .",
    "such a code contains @xmath181 codewords with the property that for all @xmath182 and @xmath183 , @xmath184 [ simplex_theorem ]    it is straightforward to see that for any @xmath185 , if we let @xmath174}$ ] , @xmath186}$ ] , then @xmath187 and @xmath188 , defined as in lemma  [ wc - binary ] , are just truncations of codewords from the simplex code .",
    "since the simplex code is a constant - weight code , with minimum distance @xmath189 , each pair of codewords intersects in exactly @xmath189 positions .",
    "this implies that there exist exactly @xmath189 positions for which one given codeword contains all zeros , and the other codeword contains all ones .",
    "these are the positions that are counted in @xmath190 , which proves the claimed result .",
    "consider the previous construction for @xmath191 , and a generating codeword @xmath192 .",
    "there are @xmath193 dna codewords of length @xmath194 obtained based on the outlined method .",
    "these codewords have minimum hamming distance equal to four , and they also have constant @xmath195 content @xmath196 . a selected subset of codewords from this code is listed below .",
    "@xmath197 the last two codewords consist of the bases @xmath5 and @xmath5 only , and clearly satisfy the shift property with @xmath198 for all @xmath199 . on the other hand , for the first three codewords",
    "one has @xmath200 , while for the next three codewords it holds that @xmath201 ( meeting the upper bound in the theorem ) . due to the cyclic nature of the generating code",
    ", one can easily generate the nussinov folding table for all the codewords @xcite .",
    "such an evaluation , as well as the use of the program package vienna , show that none of the @xmath193 codewords exhibits a secondary structure .",
    "the largest known dna codes with the parameters specified above consists of @xmath202 codewords @xcite .",
    "this code is generated by a simulated annealing process which does not allow for simple secondary structure testing .",
