    "<S> we study the interplay between superconductivity and spin density wave order in graphene doped to @xmath0 or @xmath1 filling ( a van hove doping ) . at this doping level </S>",

    "<S> right at van hove doping , the superconducting instability is strongest and emerges at the highest @xmath3 , but slightly away from van - hove doping a spin - density - wave likely emerges first . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate whether at some lower temperature superconductivity and spin - density - waves co - exist . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the landau - ginzburg functional describing interplay of the two order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that superconductivity and spin density wave order do not co - exist and are separated by first - order transitions , either as a function of doping or as a function of t.    two dimensional electron systems provide an ideal environment for exploration of many body physics . </S>",
    "<S> graphene , as a new two dimensional electron system , may allow us to access new many body phases that have not been hitherto observed . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , undoped single layer graphene seems to be well described by a non - interacting model @xcite , with the vanishing density of states suppressing interaction effects . in order to access many body physics in graphene </S>",
    "<S> , one must sidestep the vanishing density of states . </S>",
    "<S> one way to do this is by doping . </S>",
    "<S> when graphene is doped to the @xmath4 point of the brillouin zone - a doping level that corresponds to @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) filling ( undoped graphene corresponds to @xmath5 filling ) - the fermi surface undergoes a topological transition from a two piece to a one piece fermi surface @xcite . associated with this topological transition is a divergent density of states , which gives rise to weak coupling instabilities to unusual many body states . </S>",
    "<S> doped graphene thus provides a promising playground for exploration of new quantum many body states .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent success of experimental efforts to dope graphene to the @xmath4 point @xcite has inspired a flurry of theoretical works studying many body physics in doped graphene @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been established @xcite that the principal weak coupling instabilities are to chiral @xmath2 superconductivity and to a uniaxial spin density wave ( sdw ) , with the superconducting instability leading at van hove doping @xcite , and the sdw leading somewhat away from van hove doping @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is not known , however , whether these two orders are mutually exclusive , or whether they co - exist in some range of temperatures and dopings .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that for graphene near the @xmath4 point , superconductivity and sdw magnetism are mutually exclusive orders . </S>",
    "<S> we derive landau - ginzburg action for two order parameters and show that the interplay between quartic terms is such that the minimum of the action is when only one order parameter is nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> this result stands in stark contrast to pnictide materials , where landau - ginzburg analysis shows that superconducting and sdw orders do co - exist @xcite . in doped graphene one </S>",
    "<S> expects to observe pure chiral superconductivity at van hove doping , with a first - order transition to pure spin density wave order upon doping away from the van hove point . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusions apply also to doped triangular lattice systems @xcite , which have an identical low energy description near @xmath6 filling .    _ the model : _ our point of departure is the tight binding model @xcite , with the nearest - neighbor dispersion @xmath7 where the overall sign is @xmath8 or @xmath9 depending on whether we are above or below half filling . for definiteness </S>",
    "<S> we take a plus sign . </S>",
    "<S> van hove doping then corresponds to @xmath10 , at which point the fermi surface has the form shown in ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> the fermi velocity vanishes near the hexagon corners @xmath11 , which are saddle points of the dispersion : @xmath12 each time @xmath13 is a deviation from a saddle point . </S>",
    "<S> saddle points give rise to a logarithmic singularity in the dos and control physics at weak coupling . </S>",
    "<S> there are three in - equivalent nesting vectors @xmath14 connecting in - equivalent pairs of saddle points @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( see fig.[fig : fs ] ) : @xmath17 each @xmath18 is physically the same as @xmath19 because @xmath18 is half of a reciprocal lattice vector .    </S>",

    "<S> relevant interactions are density - density interaction within one patch ( @xmath23 ) and between patches ( @xmath24 and the interaction which describes hopping of a pair of fermions from one patch to the other ( @xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fourth interaction @xmath26 is the exchange interaction between patches . </S>",
    "<S> interactions @xmath27 and @xmath25 renormalize particle - hole vertices and control the sdw instability , while interactions @xmath25 and @xmath23 renormalize particle - particle vertices and control the superconducting instability ( note that @xmath25 contributes to both instabilities ) .    </S>",

    "<S> this action displays instabilities towards d - wave superconductivity and sdw . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore decouple the interactions in the d - wave superconducting and sdw channels simultaneously , by means of two hubbard stratanovich transformations . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the hubbard - stratanovich superconducting fields @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> since the superconductivity is known to be @xmath2 @xcite , we set @xmath39 and describe superconducting fields by a single complex order parameter @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce the three sdw order parameters @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> since the sdw order is known to be uniaxial @xcite , we can replace the three vector order parameters @xmath42 by a single scalar sdw order parameter @xmath4 , which represents the magnetic order along the sdw axis . </S>",
    "<S> since the system has @xmath43 spin rotation symmetry , the sdw axis can be chosen to coincide with the @xmath44 axis without loss of generality . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we introduce the nambu spinor @xmath45 , a four component spinor defined according to @xmath46 . the action after hubbard stratanovich transformation can be written in the nambu spinor basis as @xmath47 here the @xmath48 are pauli matrices acting in the particle - hole space , the @xmath49 are pauli matrices acting in the spin space , @xmath50 is a two dimensional identity matrix , and @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the notation we have used is borrowed from @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now integrate out the fermions exactly to obtain an action purely in terms of the superconducting and sdw order parameter fields , @xmath52 where the trace goes over nambu spinor indices , and also over imaginary time and over momentum . </S>",
    "<S> we now define @xmath53 to be the `` bare '' ( matrix ) green function evaluated at @xmath54 , and define matrix order parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 , such that @xmath57 we can then write @xmath58 it is convenient to explicitly write out the expressions for @xmath59 and @xmath56 . </S>",

    "<S> , we can define the various matrices as    @xmath62    thus far , everything we have done has been exact . </S>",
    "<S> we now work close to @xmath3 and perform a double expansion of ( [ eq : preexpansion ] ) in small @xmath63 and small @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we terminate the expansion at quartic order in both fields and drop all terms that are odd in powers of @xmath56 or @xmath55 as they vanish upon taking the trace . </S>",

    "<S> renormalization group analysis shows that the couplings which determine both superconducting and sdw instabilities diverge at the onset of the first instability upon lowering t  @xcite . the critical temperatures , however , are determined by superconducting and sdw susceptibilities , which generally have different exponents ( different anomalous dimensions ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been demonstrated on general grounds@xcite that different orders emerge simultaneously when their anomalous dimensions @xmath69 . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous exponents for superconducting and sdw susceptibilities have been calculated in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using results from that work , we find that @xmath70 , while @xmath71 ( the results are for perfect nesting ) . because @xmath72 , @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> however , since @xmath74 is very close to one , we expect that @xmath75 in ( [ eq : free energy ] ) is only slightly lower than @xmath3 , in which case the expansion up to quartic order in @xmath40 and @xmath4 is justified . for dopings slightly away from the van - hove one , we expect sdw to be the leading instability  @xcite . in this case , @xmath76 , again we assume that the difference between the two critical temperatures is small .    </S>",
    "<S> it was shown in the context of pnictides @xcite that a free energy of the form ( [ eq : free energy ] ) leads to co - existence of the two order parameters if @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> we computed the coefficients @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 in our case by explicitly integrating over fermionic momenta and summing over fermionic frequencies in ( [ ki ] ) ( for details see supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain , with logarithmic accuracy @xmath81 note that there are two processes which contribute to the coefficient @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> the processes are represented diagrammatically in fig.([fig : diag ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the process shown in fig.([fig : diag],a ) is sensitive to the chirality of the superconducting order parameter , because of the dependence on the phase difference between different saddle points , and gives rise to the @xmath82 term . because @xmath83 , this process gives rise to an effective attraction between superconductivity and spin density waves . </S>",
    "<S> this effective attraction is , however , outweighed by a larger ( chirality independent ) repulsion between the two order parameters , coming from the processes shown in fig.([fig : diag],b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the prefactors in our case are such that @xmath84 . comparing @xmath85 and @xmath86 </S>",
    "<S> we see that in the case of doped graphene @xmath87 , so that co - existence is disfavored . </S>",
    "<S> the system only allows one order parameter to exist , even when @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> a direct second order transition between superconducting and sdw orders is landau forbidden , since the symmetry group of one ordered phase is not a subgroup of the symmetry group of the other ordered phase , and as a result the transition separating the region when @xmath89 from the region where @xmath90 is expected to be first order . </S>",
    "<S> ( although we can not exclude a non - landau continuous transition between the two ordered states . )    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath91 makes co - existence even less likely . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that _ there is no co - existence of superconducting and sdw order in doped graphene_.    in pnictides , the structure of @xmath92 is quite similar  @xcite ( modulo that there is no @xmath93 term ) , but the argument of @xmath94 in @xmath80 is the phase difference between the gaps on hole and electron fss . for @xmath95 superconductivity , </S>",
    "<S> the argument is @xmath96 , in which case @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath98 , and one has to include subleading terms to verify whether the two orders can co - exist . </S>",
    "<S> the subleading terms are the ones which break the nesting between hole and electron pockets , and the analysis shows  @xcite that @xmath95 superconducting and sdw orders co - exist in some range of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in graphene , the argument of @xmath94 is @xmath99 , and such co - existence does not occur .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that superconductivity and spin density wave order are mutually exclusive in graphene doped near the @xmath4 point of the brillouin zone ( a van hove doping ) . sufficiently close to the van hove point </S>",
