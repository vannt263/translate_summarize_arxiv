    ", mass will be realized from a fixed value of the planck constant by various means .",
    "a promising apparatus to realize mass at the kilogram level is the watt balance  @xcite .",
    "watt balances have a long history at the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) . in 1980 , nist s first watt balance was designed to realize the absolute ampere and then later to measure the planck constant  @xcite . in the past three and a half decades , several measurements of the planck constant have been published , the most recent in 2014  @xcite .",

    "a watt balance is a force transducer that can be calibrated in absolute terms using voltage , resistance , frequency , and length reference standards , i.e. , without dead weights .",
    "the instrument is used in two modes , typically referred to as force mode and velocity mode . in force mode , the gravitational force of a mass , @xmath1 , is compensated by an electromagnetic force .",
    "the electromagnetic force is produced by a current in a coil that is immersed in a radial magnetic field .",
    "the equation governing the force mode is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the current in the coil , @xmath4 the wire length of the coil , and @xmath5 the magnetic flux density of the field at the coil position .",
    "the local acceleration @xmath6 and the current @xmath3 can be measured using dedicated instruments .",
    "the only term that needs calibration is the flux integral @xmath7 .",
    "this integral can be calibrated to very high precision in velocity mode .",
    "the coil is moved through the magnetic field with constant velocity @xmath8 yielding an induced voltage , @xmath9 .",
    "the flux integral is inferred by dividing the voltage by the velocity . by using this calibrated value of @xmath7 in the equation of the force mode",
    ", the value for the mass can be obtained by @xmath10 the equation above connects mass to electrical quantities : current and voltage .",

    "the considerations that led to the design of the permanent magnet system described here are given in  @xcite .",

    "the inner 10 cm of the gap is called the precision air gap and it is desired to have a very uniform field in the central 8 cm of this precision air gap .",
    "short of twelve access holes in each the top and bottom , the gap is entirely enclosed by iron .    in order to insert the coil into the air gap , the magnet can be split open such that the top two thirds of the magnet separate from the bottom third .",

    "two sm@xmath11co@xmath12  rings , with a combined mass of 91 kg , form the active magnetic material . because it requires a lot of power and a large fixture to magnetize one ring , each ring was segmented in 40 pieces ,",

    "each piece was individually magnetized . the segmentation was carried out in three concentric rings comprised of 9 , 13 , and 18 segments each .",
    "the largest segments in the outer ring has a volume of 138.6@xmath13 .",
    "the sm@xmath11co@xmath12  rings had to be assembled with the segments fully magnetized . to facilitate this assembly process and to keep the repulsive forces between individual segments under control , the rings were assembled on the inner yoke pieces using vacuum compatible epoxy . in addition , a stainless steel band around the ring , as shown in fig .",

    "this is the preferred operating point for a watt balance , because the reluctance of the magnetic circuit is independent of the weighing current . in our magnet , we are not quite at the maximum value of @xmath30 , but close .",
    "the effect of the weighing current on the yoke reluctance needs to be analyzed in detail . with the measurements shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : bvsh ] and [ fig : perm ] , we provide a basis to further model these effects .",
    "the temperature dependence of the radial magnetic flux density in the gap is governed primarily by the temperature coefficient of the sm@xmath11co@xmath12 .",
    "in addition , the flux density depends , to a smaller extent , on changes in reluctance of the magnetic circuit caused by temperature dependence of the permeability of the iron and changes in geometry due to thermal expansion .",
    "the temperature coefficient of the magnetic flux density in the gap was measured and found to be @xmath49 at a temperature of @xmath50c .",
    "one of the key objectives in designing this magnet was to obtain a flat field profile , i.e. , a small change of the radial field as a function of the vertical position .",
    "in other words , the vertical gradient of the radial field should be as small as possible .",
    "there are two reasons for this objective : first , the force mode consists of two different measurements called mass - on and mass - off . between the two measurements , the coil position changes slightly in vertical position .",
    "if the field profile is flat , the flux integral remains the same for both measurements and no correction is required .",
    "second , during the velocity mode the coil is moved through the magnetic field such that the induced voltage stays constant . in a flat field profile ,",
    "the velocity required to achieve constant induced voltage remains constant and is thus easier to measure .",
    "a flat field profile reduces uncertainties in watt balance experiments .",
    "the goal was that the magnetic flux density should vary by less than @xmath51 over the inner 8 cm of the gap .",
    "two methods were employed to measure the vertical gradient of the radial field : a guided hall probe and a gradiometer coil .",
    "two setups were used for the hall - probe method , one built by eec and the other by nist . in both systems , a brass tube is centered on the gap of the magnet in which a second brass tube containing a hall probe ( lakeshore mmz-2518-uh and hmmt-6704-vr for the eec and nist system , respectively ) is guided .",
    "the guide tube was centered in the air gap by two tapered teflon plugs , one at the top and one at the bottom .",
    "the probe was centered to be concentric with one access hole each at the upper and lower yoke cap .",
    "the guide tube was mounted in a coaxial hole in both teflon cones .",
    "the magnetic field was recorded at different positions .",
    "the eec setup required manual vertical positioning of the hall probe , while the nist setup used a motorized translation stage .",
    "the resolution of each hall probe is @xmath52 t , which corresponds to a relative change in the magnetic flux density of @xmath53 . in order to measure smaller changes in the field ,",
    "multiple measurements have to be averaged .",
    "we averaged the field profile measured in all twelve holes to one profile .",
    "this procedure discards the azimuthal information and obtains an average vertical profile .",
    "the gradiometer coil consists of two identical coils wound on a single former displaced in the vertical direction .",
    "each coil has @xmath54 turns and a mean radius of @xmath55 mm .",
    "the height of each coil is 10 mm and the centers of the coils are displaced by @xmath56 mm .",
    "the two coils are electrically connected in series opposition .",
    "two voltmeters are used to measure the induced voltages as the coil assembly is moved with constant velocity , @xmath57mm / s through the magnet .",
    "one voltmeter measures the voltage induced in one coil , the other the difference .",
    "the ratio of the two measurements is given by @xmath58 the absolute magnitude of the radial magnetic flux density can be estimated from the mean velocity , @xmath57mm / s of the coil and the coil s dimensions using @xmath59 .",
    "vibrations induced by the coil motion cause excess noise on @xmath60 with several mv amplitude . to get a good estimate of the magnetic flux density ,",
    "the voltage was averaged over the central 80 mm .",
    "note that the mean value is not the important quantity in this measurement .",
    "the vertical variation of the field is calculated by numerically integrating equation  [ eq2 ] yielding @xmath61 where @xmath62 is chosen such that @xmath63 . since both coils are mounted on the same coil former and are immersed in approximately the same flux density , the voltage noise on the difference is reduced by a large factor ( about 1000 ) .",
    "[ fig : onesweep ] shows a typical measurement . in the central region ,",
    "the difference of @xmath60 and @xmath64 is @xmath65mv , indicated by the dashed line in the middle plot of the figure .",
    "this voltage difference corresponds to a slope in the field of -13t / mm . to exclude systematic errors ,",
    "i.e. , caused for example by a coil winding error , we performed one measurement with the coil mounted up - side down . after correcting for the electrical connections",
    ", we obtained the same field profile .     and @xmath66 .",
    "the bottom graph shows the radial flux density as a function of position calculated from the raw data .",
    "the horizontal axis is such that zero is the center of the magnet and positive numbers are above the center.,width=336 ]    the gradiometer coil was preferred over the guided hall probe to measure the field profile with high accuracy because of several reasons .",
    "the measurement with the gradiometer coil is first order independent of the concentricity of coil and magnet .",
    "the result is also in first order insensitive to the parallelism of the motion axis to the magnet axis .",
    "furthermore , the coil integrates the field along the azimuthal direction .",
    "the gradiometer coil measurement has enough resolution to measure even small field gradients . during the construction of the magnet ,",
    "measurements with the gradiometer coil were performed twice .",
    "the manufacturer used the guided hall probe to measure the field profile . as it is detailed below",
    ", the attempts to shim the field by grinding the outer yoke did not converge .",
    "this was not due to limitations of the field measurements .",
    "it was , as we learned later , due to the change of the field profile caused by opening and closing the magnet .",
    "after all pieces of the magnet were manufactured , the magnet was assembled for the first time and the radial magnetic flux density of the magnet was measured .",
    "this measurement was performed at the manufacturer s facility with three different methods . besides the gradiometer coil , two hall probes were used .",
    "the measurement with the eec hall probe was performed on two different days about 1.5 weeks apart .",
    "the results of the measurements are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] . in order to overlay the measurements ,",
    "the value of @xmath67 has been subtracted from each measurement .",
    "all four measurements show a similar slope of the radial magnetic flux density , about -13t / mm , which is about a factor of 10 larger than intended .",
    "the measured variation of the radial flux density in the precision gap of at least 1mt failed the requirement of @xmath68 by a factor of 10 .",
    "based on this measurement , it was decided to regrind the inner diameter of the outer yoke ( part 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuitclose ] ) . the specification for this regrinding was to add a taper such that the gap is nominally 3.000 cm at the top to 3.008 cm at the bottom . varying",
    "the gap is a known technique to engineer a desired field profile  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : grindingresult ] shows the measurement of the radial magnetic flux density after grinding the outer yoke .",
    "this measurement was performed only at eec with their hall probe .",
    "the slope of the radial magnetic flux density at the center has changed from -13t / mm to 7t / mm . from this measurement , it was concluded that the grinding overshot by approximately 50% .",
    "the outer yoke was sent back to the grinding house with the instruction to grind the gap such that it is nominally 3.003 cm at the top to 3.008 cm at the bottom , reversing 1/3 of the first grinding process .",
    "after the second grinding process , the magnetic flux density was measured again at eec .",
    "this result was almost identical to the previous measurement . from this , it was concluded that the measurements with the hall probe are not reliable at this level .",
    "it is possible that the trajectory of the hall probe was not centered well enough on the gap .",
    "for example , to measure a slope in the radial magnetic flux density of 7t / mm in a perfectly uniform field , the probe only needs to travel sideways by 0.24 mm over the 8 cm region .",
    "while the probe was certainly positioned better than 1 mm in the center of the gap , an accuracy of 0.2 mm could not be ensured .",
    "after the second grinding , the gradiometer coil was brought to eec to remeasure the profile of the radial magnetic flux density .",
    "a slope of -3.5t / mm was observed , see fig .",
    "[ fig : grindingresult ] .",
    "since the grinding process did not seem to converge to a flat field profile , other shimming techniques were explored .",
    "the first approach was to insert low carbon steel rods in the inner diameter of the lower sm@xmath11co@xmath12  ring .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : grindingresult ] , the flux density was larger at the lower part of the magnet ( negative @xmath69 values ) . inserting iron in the ring changed the slope of the radial magnetic flux in the center of the magnet by approximately 1t / mm , which was a factor of three smaller than needed . hence , this strategy was abandoned .    a better way to shim the field is to introduce a small air gap between the lower third of the magnet and the upper two thirds , i.e. , a gap between the pieces 2 and 6 on the top and the pieces 3 and 7 on the bottom in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuitclose ] .",
    "a flat profile is obtained when this additional air gap is about 0.5 mm high .",
    "a stable and uniform air gap can be achieved by inserting aluminum shim stock pieces at several azimuthal locations .",
    "this small air gap increases the reluctance of the lower part of the yoke .",
    "hence , the lower sm@xmath11co@xmath12  ring contributes less flux to the magnetic flux density of the gap .",
    "the profile that is obtained with this method is shown as the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : good ] .",
    "while this shimming method obtains a flat profile , it has one disadvantage : a small air gap connects the precision air gap inside the magnet to the outside world and flux leaks out of the magnet .",
    "hence , the shielding of the magnet is compromised .     around the value at @xmath70 .",
    "two shimming methods lead to a similar profile : introducing a small air gap ( dashed line ) and reducing the relative permeability of the iron ( solid lines).,width=336 ]    we noted that the slope in the center of the gap changed by a few t / mm every time the magnet was opened and closed .",
    "an examination of this effect yielded another shimming strategy .",
    "the variability in the vertical linear gradient of the magnetic flux density is caused by non parallel opening and closing of the magnet . in this case , a situation occurs where the lower part of the yoke touches the upper part of the yoke on one spot along the outer circumference .",
    "a large amount of flux is driven through this contact point , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hyst_exp ] .",
    "this effectively shifts the working point of the iron at the contact zone on the @xmath5-@xmath35 curve to the right , i.e , to a point with smaller relative permeability .",
    "even after the magnet is closed , the iron remains in a state of smaller relative permeability due to the hysteretic behavior of the @xmath5-@xmath35 curve .",
    "hence , in the closed state this part of the yoke conducts the magnetic field less well and the flux in the gap is lower .",
    "the shimming process works as follows : ( 1 ) the magnet is opened by a little more than 1 mm .",
    "( 2 ) a 0.5 mm thick shim piece with a size of approximately 5 cm by 5 cm is inserted in the 1 mm gap at an azimuthal position @xmath71 .",
    "( 3 ) the magnet is closed .",
    "due to the shim , the magnet closes in a tilted fashion and the iron at the azimuthal position @xmath72 is driven to the state with less relative permeability .",
    "steps ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) are performed a total of six times , where the azimuthal position is advanced by @xmath73 every time .",
    "after this , the iron is at the less permeable state for the entire circumference .",
    "-@xmath35 curve . during opening ,",
    "the point w moves along a minor hysteresis loop to smaller values of @xmath5 and @xmath35 .",
    "the point s moves along the major curve to a higher value of @xmath5 and @xmath35 .",
    "after closing , the point w moves almost back to the original point ( the solid w ) .",
    "the point on the small side of the wedge moves along a minor loop to a new point ( solid s ) that has substantial more @xmath5 .",
    "the mean value can be found at the point denoted by f for final point .",
    "overall the @xmath30 of the yoke has decreased , reducing the flux in the air gap . , width=336 ]    this shimming process is repeatable .",
    "we were able to reproduce the shimming procedure several times , yielding an almost identical field profile .",
    "we have two concerns using this shimming procedure : how stable is the field in the gap obtained with this method ? does this process change the azimuthal symmetry of the field ?",
    "we measured the field profile over 3 days every 30 minutes and we found that the slope of the radial magnetic flux density changed linearly with time from -0.594  t / mm to -0.609  t / mm over 60 hours . hence the slope changes with a rate of @xmath74t/(mmh ) .",
    "this is enough stability for a watt balance experiment , where the flux integral is measured every hour .",
    "the azimuthal variation of the magnetic flux density is hard to measure with high precision .",

    "@xmath166a / m were assumed .    the bottom plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : field_force ] shows the calculated magnetic force for the two terms in ( [ eq : mag ] ) .",

    "the second term produces a force that can be as large as 3 g for the stainless steel mass in its weighing position .",
    "there are three strategies to mitigate this effect .",
    "first , a mass can be chosen that has a smaller permanent magnetization .",
    "as mentioned above , this calculation was performed with the maximum permissible magnetization for an e@xmath164 mass .",
    "second , the magnetization term changes sign as the mass is rotated up - side down",
    ". if a mass with a magnetization of @xmath168a / m has to be measured in the new watt balance , the magnetic effect can be nulled by averaging two measurements with the mass rotated up - side down in between .",
    "third , two coils wired in series opposition can be installed above and below the mass generating a magnetic field gradient . by choosing the right current in the coil a vertical field gradient",
    "can be generated that cancels the existing gradient .",
    "if the actual gradient at the mass is zero , both terms vanish .    in summary ,",
    "the external field above the new permanent magnet is sufficiently small such that stainless steel masses can be used in the new watt balance .",
    "if an e@xmath164 mass with a nominal value of 1 kg is used , a worst case magnetic force of 4 g is expected .",
    "weight was assumed with the maximum allowed values for the magnetic susceptibility , @xmath165 and magnetization , 2a / m .",
    "the vertical dotted line indicates the position of the mass during weighing.,width=336 ]",
    "another interesting measurement is the power spectral amplitude of the voltage across a coil at rest inside the magnet . to accomplish this measurement ,",
    "the three coils of the radial gradiometer coil were connected in series .",
    "[ fig : coilingap ] shows the coil in the gap .",
    "the coil is supported by three pillars .",
    "each pillar is composed of two optical posts and one teflon spacer joined together by brass set screws .",
    "the coil is concentric and vertically centered inside the air gap .",
    "this measurement was performed with the magnet sitting on a pallet in storage .",
    "hence , the vibrational environment for this measurement was not ideal .",
    "the power spectral amplitude was measured using a rhode & schwarz upv audio analyzer .",
    "[ fig : frank2noise ] shows the measured spectra for both channels of the analyzer .",
    "one channel was connected to the coil , while the other was shorted .",
    "two observations on the spectrum of the coil voltage are noteworthy .",
    "first , at the low frequency end , the spectral amplitude is below 1v@xmath120 .",
    "this is an important figure of merit , since a white noise of smaller than 1v/@xmath120 would allow the determination of the flux integral @xmath7 with a relative uncertainty of @xmath169 in 10000 seconds .",
    "second , there is a lot of excess noise in the region between 10hz and 500hz .",
    "this excess noise is mostly due to mechanical resonances in the coil and the coil support .",
    "these peaks are from different vibration modes of the coil , some of which we could identify .",
    "the radial gradiometer coil was not optimized for stiffness , since it was built to measure the radial gradient of the field .",
    "the design of the coil for nist-4 is currently ongoing .",
    "one focus in the design work is to dampen the vibration mode in the frequency range from 10hz to 300hz .",
    "ultimately , nist-4 will be installled in an underground laboratory .",
    "this environment will have less vibration .",
    "in this environment the peaks in the spectral amplitude should be greatly reduced .",
    "the nist-4 magnet has been successfully built .",
    "initial measurements of the basic properties of the magnet were carried out at nist .",
    "a dedicated gradiometer coil was built to measure the vertical gradient of the radial flux density .",
    "the measurements with the gradiometer coil enabled the manufacturer , eec , to regrind the gap improving the field profile .",
    "after delivery , it was found that the magnetic field profile could be further improved by changing the magnetic working point of the iron yoke .",
    "this can be accomplished by opening the magnet in a tilted fashion . using this technique , the profile of the radial magnetic flux density",
    "could be changed to have a nearly vanishing derivative with respect to @xmath69 at the symmetry plane of the magnet .",
    "the magnetic flux density stayed within @xmath170 of its value in the center over a travel range of 5 cm .",
    "the radial dependence of the radial magnetic flux density was measured using a radial gradiometer coil .",
    "it was found that the field follows a @xmath41 dependence closely , and we expect any relative systematic error due to geometry changes of the coil of about @xmath106 .",
    "this effect can be reduced by incorporating a heater in the coil .",
    "we investigated the forces on the coil due to the reluctance force .",
    "this force can lead to a systematic error via two mechanisms : ( 1 ) a difference in the mass - on and mass - off current and ( 2 ) a parasitic motion of the coil in these two states .",
    "it was determined that each of the two components produces a relative systematic error below @xmath171 for reasonable assumptions .",
    "the external magnetic field was measured above the magnet , i.e. where the balance and mass would be located .",
    "it was found that the field drops off rapidly reaching the earth s magnetic field at about 600 mm above the top surface of the magnet . the spurious force on a stainless steel weight , class e@xmath164 , was calculated using worst case assumptions detailed in oiml r111 . in this case , the relative systematic effect produced by the magnet is about @xmath172 .",
    "hence , it is possible to use a e@xmath164 stainless steel mass on the nist-4 watt balance without a substantial increase in uncertainty .",
    "this uncertainty can be reduced by installing bucking coils , using ptir artifacts or numerically canceling the permanent magnetization of the stainless artifact by measuring it upside down .",
    "the power spectral amplitude of a coil in the magnet was measured .",
    "the spectrum is currently dominated by mechanical resonances and vibrations in the frequency region from 10hz to 500hz . assuming these resonances can be removed and the vibrations damped , a measurement of @xmath7 with a relative uncertainty ( type a ) of @xmath169 can be achieved with an integration time of @xmath173  hours or less .",
    "this uncertainty may be reduced due to partial cancellation of the voltage noise with velocity noise , which is likely to be highly correlated with the voltage noise .    adding the relative type b uncertainties mentioned above in quadrature yields @xmath174 .",
    "this is a conservative estimate of the uncertainty of the magnet system , because the improvements outlined above would reduce this uncertainty by approximately a factor of two . in conclusion",
    "the known systematic effects from the magnet system are small enough to allow the construction of a watt balance at the 1 kg level with a relative uncertainty of a few parts in @xmath175 .",
