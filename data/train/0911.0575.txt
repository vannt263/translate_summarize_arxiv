    "we will see that the neutrino production amplitudes are unchanged even though the smaller wave packet , @xmath15 , is used .",
    "the reason why the result is unchanged even with such a small wave packet is that the neutrino is so light that its velocity @xmath51 is almost the light velocity .",
    "consequently , the two space time positions of the neutrino are almost on the light cone where the dominant contribution in the amplitude comes from , as it will be discussed in the next section .",

    "this difference is important for the reason why the relativistic system has a peculiar property of the interference .",
    "it is worthwhile to clarify the difference of the space - time dependent probability of the present work with the normal scattering probability defined at @xmath142 here .",
    "the normal scattering amplitude is defined from the overlap between the in - state at @xmath221 and out - state at @xmath222 , and the space and time coordinates are integrated from @xmath223 to @xmath224 and the energy and momentum of the final state is the same as that of the initial state .",
    "hence the momentum of the muon or the pion in the final state of the ordinary scattering experiments are bounded due to the energy momentum conservation .",
    "so the infinite momentum is not included in the muon or pion of the final state . however the amplitude and probability at the finite time and their behaviors at the finite time are not computable in the ordinary s - matrix .    in our method",

    "the energy and momentum conservation does not hold for these quantities and the infinite momentum state of the muon and pion are included .",
    "these states of the infinite momentum give the finite contribution to the time dependent probability but do not contribute to the cross section measured at infinite distance .",
    "the important informations are obtained from the wave packet formalism that are not calculable in the standard scattering amplitude .",
    "hence our calculation does not contradict with the ordinary calculation of the s - matrix in momentum representation but has the advantage of giving new informations .    in our calculation ,",

    "the characteristic small phase of the relativistic wave packet shows macroscopic interference of the neutrino .",
    "although this result should be applied in high energy region , it would be interesting to see if this effect is found in ground experiments and others .",
    "depending on the mass value , the phenomenon we have discussed in this paper may be relevant to short base line experiments , long base line experiments , and atmospheric neutrino experiments and others .",
