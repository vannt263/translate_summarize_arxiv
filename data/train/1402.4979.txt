    "by the end of the last century generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) had been identified as a suitable tool to parametrize exclusive processes and to extract the contained information on hadron structure @xcite ( for a more detailed description we refer to the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "this has triggered large activities in both the experimental and theoretical communities .",
    "on the experimental side one faces the difficulty that ( hard ) exclusive processes are power suppressed .",
    "hence , precision measurements are challenging and require high luminosities .",
    "in addition , gpds enter the cross section not directly , but via a convolution with a hard scattering kernel .",
    "complementary information from the theoretical side is therefore most valuable .",
    "one framework capable of providing such information on nonperturbative quantities is lattice qcd .",
    "unfortunately simulations suffer typically from at least one of the systematic errors associated with discretization , finite volume and unphysical quark masses .",
    "therefore , having a better control over some of the various extrapolations and the associated systematic errors is very helpful to obtain reliable quantitative results .",
    "the most rigorous way to gain such control is given by chiral perturbation theory @xcite as opposed to _",
    "ad hoc _ or model - based extrapolation formulas .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the first @xmath0 moments of chiral - even gpds . in the parity",
    "- even sector those encode information on the momentum distribution of the considered parton species , since the corresponding local operators coincide with the off - diagonal elements of the energy - momentum tensor . in the forward limit",
    "one has simple relations to the momentum fraction and the total angular momentum carried by a specific parton species ( as pointed out by ji @xcite ) .",
    "the first moment of the parity - odd quark gpd has been linked to the quark spin - orbit correlation recently ( see ref .",
    "we use the framework of two - flavor covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory ( bchpt )  @xcite to obtain analytic formulas describing the pion mass dependence of the first moments at full one - loop order ( @xmath1 , where @xmath2 represents both the scale of the pion mass and the momentum transfer , which are considered to be small in the low - energy regime ) .",
    "there already exist various heavy baryon calculations on the topic ( e.g.  @xcite ) and covariant leading one - loop calculations @xcite , where third - order effects are only partially included .",
    "this work is an extension of ref .",

    "doing so one would however loose all benefits of the covariant result , like the correct behavior near the two - pion threshold at @xmath110 and the improved convergence that is often ascribed to the untruncated results . a reasonable compromise could look as follows : truncate diagrams and , which yield the main share of the new lecs , but keep the triangle diagrams and , which do not introduce new lecs , to all orders .",

    "the low - energy versions of the gluon operator @xmath24 and the singlet combination of the quark operator @xmath111 are equal up to the numerical value of the lecs since they behave similar under chiral rotations , charge conjugation and parity transformation .",
    "we therefore define the operator by a mere replacement of lecs : @xmath112 the generalized form factors inherit this property and are obtained via replacing all superscripts @xmath113 by @xmath114 .",

    "this can be achieved most easily by keeping the ratio @xmath118 , which is counted as @xmath119 , fixed .",

    "one therefore presumably needs simulations with twisted boundary conditions , where low momentum transfer is accessible without going to very large volumes .",

    "another challenging topic would be the ( simultaneous ) calculation of all @xmath0 moments by the use of nonlocal operators . in ref .",

    "<S> in this paper we present chiral extrapolation formulas for the generalized form factors connected to the first moments of chiral - even generalized parton distributions . for the description of qcd at low energies we employ the framework of two - flavor covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory at full one - loop accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> our results are well suited for the extrapolation of lattice qcd data to physical quark masses . </S>"
