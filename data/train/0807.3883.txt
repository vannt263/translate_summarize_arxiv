    "the understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) would be right at the top of the agenda when we would start analysing the lhc data @xcite .",
    "both the cms and the atlas detectors are poised to resolve this issue .",
    "the question is the following : whether the higgs mechanism as depicted in the standard model ( sm ) is a complete description of ewsb consistent with all experimental data , or there is a more fundamental underlying dynamics that mimics a higgs - like picture at the electroweak scale . on theoretical grounds ,",
    "the latter seems to be the case .",
    "then , in what form would that new physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) manifest in the lhc data ?",
    "we need to crack several codes before we can possibly unravel the most _ expensive _ secret challenging our imagination !",
    "the sm reigns supreme at the electroweak scale and electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) , primarily at lep , have put a lot of restraints on how a bsm scenario should be perceived . non - abelian gauge theory has been established to a very good accuracy : ( i ) the @xmath0 and @xmath1 vertices have been measured to a per cent accuracy at lep-2 implying that the su(2 ) @xmath2 u(1 ) gauge theory is unbroken at the vertices , ( ii )",
    "accurate measurements of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 masses have indicated that gauge symmetry is broken in masses , and the longitudinal polarizations of those gauge bosons , which are absent in the unbroken phase of the symmetry , should find their ancestry in the dynamics that portrays a higgs - like picture .",
    "the @xmath5-parameter has been measured to a very good accuracy as being very close to unity - a feature that attests the doublet structure of the higgs assumed in the sm .",
    "any viable bsm scenario should be in accord to the above properties . in what follows ,",
    "we first briefly review the sm higgs mechanism and then take on supersymmetry , little higgs , gauge - higgs unification and the higgsless models , keeping our discussions confined only to their ewsb aspects .",
    "there is a complex scalar doublet @xmath6 , and the potential is @xmath7 spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) requires @xmath8 , and the stability of the potential ( that it is bounded from below ) demands that @xmath9 .",
    "after ssb , an order parameter , called ` vacuum expectation value ( vev ) ' , is generated : @xmath10 . the charged and neutral force particles , namely , the @xmath11 and @xmath3 bosons , ` swallow ' the @xmath12 and @xmath13 components of @xmath14 to constitute their longitudinal polarizations , which yield @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge couplings , respectively .",
    "the fermion masses are also controlled by @xmath19 and are given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the yukawa coupling of the fermion @xmath22 .",
    "the higgs boson ( @xmath23 ) arises from the quantum fluctuation of @xmath24 around the vev ( @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 .",
    "the latest global electroweak fit gives @xmath27 gev and @xmath28 gev .",
    "the higgs mass enters electroweak fit through the @xmath29 and @xmath30 parameters . at the tree level , @xmath31 .",
    "the quantum corrections show a logarithmic sensitivity to the higgs mass : @xmath32,~~     s \\simeq \\frac{1}{6\\pi } \\ln\\left(\\frac{m_h}{m_z } \\right ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there is a strong quadratic dependence on the top mass . at present , the cdf and d0 combined estimate is @xmath33 gev .",
    "this translates into an upper limit on the higgs mass : @xmath34 gev at 95% cl ( imposing the direct search limit @xmath35 gev in the fit , from non - observation of higgs at lep-2 in the bjorken process @xmath36 ) @xcite .",
    "1a and 1b capture the details .",
    "_ unitarity _ @xcite places an upper bound on @xmath37 beyond which the theory becomes non - perturbative . here",
    ", we shall call it a ` tree level unitarity ' as we would require that the tree level contribution of the first partial wave in the expansion of different scattering amplitudes does not saturate unitarity ( in other words , some probability should not exceed unity ) . the scattering amplitudes involving gauge bosons and higgs",
    "can be decomposed into partial waves ( using ` equivalence theorem ' ) as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the @xmath40th partial wave , @xmath41 is the @xmath40th legendre polynomial and @xmath42 is the scattering matrix element .",
    "the _ most _ divergent scattering amplitude arises from @xmath43 channel , leading to @xmath44 . satisfying the unitarity constraint , i.e. @xmath45 , yields @xmath46 gev .    besides",
    ", there are theoretical upper and lower limits on the higgs mass arising from the twin requirements @xcite : ( i ) the running quartic coupling @xmath47 should not hit the landau pole throughout the history of renormalization group ( rg ) evolution from the electroweak scale @xmath19 to some cutoff @xmath48 , and ( ii ) @xmath49 should always stay positive , so that the scalar potential remains bounded from below .",
    "the bounds follow from the following rg evolution of the quartic coupling , given by ( @xmath50 ) : @xmath51 \\ , .\\ ] ] recall , @xmath52 , and that is how the higgs mass enters into the game .",
    "the _ triviality _ argument of staying within the perturbative limit by maintaining @xmath53 leads to an upper limit @xmath54 gev for @xmath55 gev .",
    "the _ vacuum stability _",
    "argument , that @xmath56 bounds the potential from below , sets a lower limit @xmath57 gev for @xmath55 gev .",
    "the limits for other choices of the cutoff can be read off from figs .",
    "2a and 2b .",
    "once we discover the higgs , the sm spectrum is completed .",
    "but , will a completion be achieved in terms of our understanding of the universe through elementary particle interactions ?",
    "we should remember that there are phenomena which can not be explained by the sm : notably , the neutrino mass , the dark matter and the acceleration of the universe .",
    "moreover , there is a conceptual loop - hole in the description of the scalar sector : the sm suffers from the _ gauge hierarchy problem_. the quantum correction to the higgs mass is quadratically sensitive to the cutoff , @xmath58 where @xmath22 and @xmath30 in brackets stand for fermionic and scalar loops .",
    "the cutoff dependence arises because no symmetry protects the higgs mass .",
    "recall that in qed the electron mass is protected by chiral symmetry , @xmath59 , so that @xmath60 gives an enhanced symmetry . in the electroweak theory after the ssb , as we can see from eq .",
    "( [ quadcorr ] ) , there is no such enhanced symmetry when @xmath61 .",
    "more precisely , the vev @xmath19 is not protected from _",
    "large _ quantum corrections .",
    "thus , while on one hand we demand the higgs to weigh around a few hundred gev , on the other hand the quantum correction pushes it up to the cutoff ( e.g. the gut scale ) . even if we absorb the one - loop @xmath62 terms by a redifinition of @xmath63 or tuning @xmath64 , when we go to two - loop the @xmath48-dependence again shows up with different coefficients , and thus we need to tune the parameters again .",
    "we have to repeat it order - by - order in perturbation theory , which makes the theory meaningless .",
    "this is what constitutes the gauge hierarchy problem . since @xmath19 is not stable , not only the higgs mass , the masses of the gauge bosons and fermions are not stable either .",
    "another bothering issue is the _ negative _ sign put _ by hand _ in front of @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ smpot ] ) to make ssb happen .",
    "we must have a dynamical understanding of this _ ad hoc _ ` minus sign ' .",
    "now we shall take a few examples of bsm scenarios and observe how in each case some underlying symmetry regulates the higgs mass .",
    "supersymmetry is a new space - time symmetry interchanging bosons and fermions , relating states of different spin @xcite .",
    "the poincare group is extended by adding two anticommuting generators @xmath65 and @xmath66 , to the existing @xmath67 ( linear momentum ) , @xmath40 ( angular momentum ) and @xmath68 ( boost ) , such that @xmath69 .",
    "since the new symmetry generators are spinors , not scalars , supersymmetry is not an internal symmetry .",
    "recall , dirac postulated a doubling of states by introducing an antiparticle to every particle in an attempt to reconcile special relativity with quantum mechanics . in stern - gerlach experiment , an atomic beam in an inhomogeneous magnetic field splits due to doubling of the number of electron states into spin - up and -down modes indicating a doubling with respect to angular momentum .",
    "so it is no surprise that @xmath65 would cause a further splitting into particle and superparticle ( @xmath70 ) @xcite .",
    "since @xmath65 is spinorial , the superpartners differ from their sm partners in spin .",
    "the superpartners of fermions are scalars , called ` sfermions ' , and those of gauge bosons are fermions , called ` gauginos ' . put together , a particle and its superpartner form a supermultiplet .",
    "the two irreducible supermultiplets which are used to construct the supersymmetric standard model are the ` chiral ' and the ` vector ' supermultiplets .",
    "the chiral supermultiplet contains a scalar ( e.g. selectron ) and a 2-component majorana fermion ( e.g. left - chiral electron ) .",
    "the vector supermultiplet contains a gauge field ( e.g. photon ) and a 2-component majorana fermion ( e.g. photino ) .",
    "two points are worth noting : ( i ) there is an equal number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom in a supermultiplet ; ( ii ) since @xmath71 commutes with @xmath65 , the bosons and fermions in a supermultiplet are mass degenerate .",
    "an attempt to solve the ` gauge hierarchy problem ' , i.e. , why @xmath72 , or equivalently , @xmath73 , is the main motivation behind the introduction of supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "we recall from the previous section that quantum corrections to the higgs mass from a bosonic loop and a fermionic loop have _ opposite _ signs .",
    "so if the couplings are identical and the boson is mass degenerate with the fermion , the net contribution would vanish ! what can be a better candidate than supersymmetry to do this job ? for every particle supersymmetry",
    "provides a mass degenerate partner differing by spin @xmath74 .",
    "however , the cancellation is not exact because in real world supersymmetry is badly broken .",
    "but if the breaking occurs through ` soft ' terms , i.e. in masses and not in couplings , the quadratic divergence still cancels .",
    "the residual divergence is mild , only logarithmically sensitive to the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "this was a bonus @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry was introduced not with this in mind ! in the sm ,",
    "when the gauge couplings are extrapolated to high scale , with lep measurements as input values , they do not meet at a single point .",
    "in supersymmetry , they do , at a scale @xmath75 gev , provided the superparticles weigh around 1 tev ( see fig .  3a ) .",
    "the mass - square of one of the higgs , @xmath76 , starting from a positive value in the ultraviolet becomes negative in the infrared triggering ewsb . as we remarked in the previous section that in the sm the negative sign in front of the scalar mass - square in the potential is completely _ ad hoc _ and put in by hand to ensure ewsb .",
    "in supersymmetry it is the heavy top quark that radiatively induces the sign flip ( see fig .",
    "3b ) .      the present energy density ( in units of critical density ) of a thermal - relic particle ( @xmath77 ) is theoretically calculated as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the thermal averaged non - relativistic cross section for @xmath80 .",
    "the observed dark matter density is @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "thus a weakly interacting particle with a @xmath82 gev mass , which has a typical cross section of a pb , fits the bill !",
    "interestingly , in the theoretical formula , the coefficient 0.1 was derived using cosmological parameters without any direct connection to the weak scale .",
    "this numerical coincidence deserves attention .",
    "supersymmetry with conserved @xmath83-parity can provide such a dark matter candidate , a neutralino .",
    "local supersymmetry leads to supergravity .",
    "thus gravity can be unified with all other interactions .",
    "all string models invariably include supersymmetry as an intergral part .      in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , where we do not assume any particular mediation mechanism for its breaking and do not impose any gut conditions , the supersymmetry breaking soft parameters are not related to one another . here",
    ", we will see how a general supersymmetric model can be parametrized @xcite .",
    "first consider the superpotential , written in terms of the ` chiral superfields ' , as @xmath84 above , the sum is over the different generations .",
    "@xmath85 and @xmath86 are the two higgs doublet superfields .",
    "the former gives masses to down - type quarks and charged leptons and the latter gives masses to up - type quarks .",
    "@xmath87 and @xmath88 are lepton and quark doublet superfields ; @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the singlet charged lepton , down quark and up quark superfields , respectively .",
    "@xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the yukawa couplings and @xmath95 is the higgs mixing parameter . symbols with hats mean superfields and without hats refer to the corresponding scalar fields .",
    "the lagrangian is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 the generic scalar and fermion fields within the @xmath99th chiral multiplet , and @xmath100 represents the gaugino which is a majorana fermion in the vector multiplet with @xmath101 as the gauge group index .",
    "the @xmath102 term is given by @xmath103 .",
    "the soft breaking terms are given by ( @xmath104 : generation indices , @xmath101 : gauge group label ) @xmath105      let us now count the total number of real and imaginary parameters in the mssm @xcite .",
    "each yukawa matrix @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) has 9 real and 9 imaginary parameters , and there are 3 such matrices .",
    "similarly , each @xmath106 matrix in eq .",
    "( [ soft ] ) has 9 real and 9 imaginary parameters , and again there are 3 such matrices .",
    "the scalar mass square @xmath107 can be written for 5 representations : @xmath108 .",
    "for each such represenation , the @xmath109 hermitian mass square matrix has 6 real and 3 imaginary parameters . finally , we have 3 gauge couplings ( 3 real ) , 3 gaugino masses ( 3 real and 3 imaginary ) , @xmath95 and @xmath110 parameters ( 2 real and 2 imaginary ) , @xmath111 ( 2 real ) , and @xmath112 ( 1 real ) . summing up , there are 95 real and 74 imaginary parameters . but not all of them are physical .",
    "if we switch off the yukawa couplings and the soft parameters , i.e. , keep _ only _ gauge interactions , there is a global symmetry , given by @xmath113 the peccei - quinn ( pq ) and @xmath83 symmetries are global u(1 ) symmetries , which will not be discussed any further .",
    "@xmath114 implies that a unitary rotation among the 3 generations for each of the 5 representations leaves the physics invariant .",
    "however , this unitary symmetry is broken .",
    "once a symmetry is broken , the number of parameters required to describe the symmetry transformation can be removed .",
    "for example , when a u(1 ) symmetry is broken , we can remove one phase .",
    "note that a u(3 ) matrix has 3 real and 6 imaginary parameters .",
    "so we can remove 15 real and 30 imaginary parameters from the yukawa matrices once @xmath114 is broken . as we will see , the pq and @xmath83 symmetries are also broken .",
    "so we can remove 2 more imaginary parameters .",
    "but even when all the yukawa couplings and soft parameters are turned on , there is still a global symmetry , @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are baryon and lepton numbers .",
    "hence we can remove _ not _ 32 but _ only _ 30 imaginary parameters .",
    "so we are left with 95 @xmath118 15 = 80 real and 74 @xmath118 30 = 44 imaginary , i.e. , a total of 124 independent parameters .",
    "the sm had only 18 parameters .",
    "so broken supersymmetry gifts us 106 more ! in the sm we had only one cp violating phase .",
    "now we have 43 new phases which are cp violating !",
    "if we break @xmath83-parity , defined by @xmath119 , where @xmath30 is the spin , then we will have 48 more complex parameters @xcite .",
    "the reason for having to deal with so many parameters is that although we know how to parametrize broken supersymmetric theories very well , we really do not know how the symmetry is actually broken .",
    "so supersymmetry is not just a model , it is rather a class of models , each scenario differing from the others by the way the parameters are related among themselves .",
    "once we subscribe to any given supersymmetry breaking mechanism , e.g. supergravity , anomaly mediation , gauge mediation , gaugino mediation , and so on , the number of independent parameters gets drastically reduced .",
    "mssm contains two complex higgs doublets for three good reasons : ( i ) to avoid massless charged degrees of freedom , ( ii ) to maintain analyticity of the superpotential , and ( iii ) to keep the theory free from chiral anomaly , which requires two higgs doublets with opposite hypercharges . out of the 8 degrees of freedom",

    "quartic coupling in supersymmetry arises from gauge interaction ( @xmath102-term ) , it is not unexpected that the lightest higgs at tree level is lighter than the @xmath3 boson .",

    "this constitutes a clinching test of supersymmetry .",
    "if a light neutral higgs is not found at lhc approximately within this limit , mssm with two higgs doublet would be strongly disfavoured .",
    "large cancellation between apparently _ unrelated _ quantities yielding a small physical observable is a sign of _ weak health _ of the theory .",
    "a theory is less ` natural ' if it is more ` fine - tuned ' .",
    "now , to the point @xcite . from the scalar potential minimization , we obtain @xmath137 where @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the correction due to rg running from the gut scale to the electroweak scale .",
    "the rg running is heavily influenced by the top quark yukawa coupling .",

    "( [ nat ] ) exactly reproduces the lep - measured @xmath141 on the lhs .",
    "this refers to a cancellation between terms of completely different origin : the first term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ nat ] ) involves soft scalar masses parametrizing supersymmetry breaking , while the second term , i.e. the @xmath95 term , is supersymmetry preserving and appears in the superpotential .",
    "how much cancellation between these completely uncorrelated quantities can we tolerate ?",
    "of course , this is an aesthetic criterion .",
    "barbieri and giudice in @xcite introduced a measure @xmath142 where @xmath143 are input parameters at high scale .",
    "@xmath144 is a measure of fine - tuning .",
    "an upper limit on @xmath144 can be translated into an _ upper _",
    "limit on superparticle masses .",

    "this is called the ` little hierarchy ' problem of supersymmetry .",

    "the wmap data , in particular , select out only a tiny region in the parameter space ( for a detailed description of this plot , see @xcite ) . relaxing certain assumptions would definitely admit more parameter space .",
    "in nature , we have seen light scalars before  e.g. the pions  though they are composite .",

    "but now one has to make such a smart choice of gauge groups and representation of scalars that if any of the couplings ( @xmath168 ) vanishes the global symmetry is partially restrored .",

    "there is no potential at the tree level , only through radiative effects the higgs boson acquires a mass .",
    "the basic steps of understanding the ghu mechanism are as follows :    ( @xmath99 )   from a 4d point of view , a 5d gauge field @xmath195 can be decomposed as @xmath196 , where @xmath197 .",
    "the idea is to relate @xmath198 to the higgs .",
    "consider a simple example : 5d qed on @xmath199 . from a 4d point of view , the 5th component of the gauge field is indeed a scalar , and there are @xmath200 such scalars , @xmath201 .",
    "but none of these @xmath201 survives as a physical state .",
    "each of them is ` eaten up ' by the corresponding @xmath202 , and the latter becomes massive .",
    "( @xmath203 )   now take su(3 ) as a gauge group and choose an orbifold projection @xmath204 ( in fundamental rep . ) which breaks su(3 ) to su(2 ) @xmath205 u(1 ) .",
    "denote the su(3 ) generators by @xmath206 where @xmath207 .",
    "now , with a @xmath208 projection , impose the conditions that the lie - algebra valued @xmath209 and @xmath210 fields transform as @xmath211 and @xmath212 .    due to the relative",
    "_ minus sign _ between the two sets of transformations , while the massless gauge bosons would transform in the adjoint of su(2 ) @xmath205 u(1 ) , the massless scalars would behave as a complex doublet under su(2 ) @xmath205 u(1 ) .",
    "this complex doublet can be identified with our higgs doublet .",
    "( @xmath213 )   indeed , the next question is how to generate the scalar potential for electroweak breaking .",
    "the shift symmetry of the scalar @xmath198 fields ( i.e. , the higher dimensional gauge invariance ) forbids us to write this potential at the tree level .",
    "( @xmath214 )   the interaction of the higgs with bulk fermions and gauge bosons will generate an effective scalar potential at one - loop level .",
    "the gauge loops tend to push @xmath215 to zero to minimize the potential , while the fermionic loops tends to shift @xmath215 away from zero in the minimum of the potential .",
    "in fact , the kk fermions are instrumental for generating the correct vev .",
    "this way of breaking su(2 ) @xmath205 u(1 ) symmetry to u(1)@xmath216 is called the hosotani mechanism @xcite .",
    "the one - loop higgs mass is given by @xmath217 where @xmath101 is a dimensionless parameter arising from bulk interactions , and the sum is over all kk particles .",
    "clearly , 5d gauge symmetry is recovered when @xmath218 .",
    "( @xmath19 )   a snapshot of the gauge spectrum is the following : @xmath219    the periodicity property demands that the spectrum will remain invariant under @xmath220 .",
    "this restricts @xmath221 $ ] .",
    "orbifolding further reduces it to @xmath222 $ ] . in principle",
    ", @xmath101 can be fixed from the @xmath4 mass .",
    "we face some difficult obstacles while constructing a realistic scenario .",
    "the ghu models often lead to ( @xmath223 ) too small a top quark mass , ( @xmath224 ) too small a higgs mass , and ( @xmath156 ) too low a compactification scale .",
    "besides , one has also to worry about how to generate hierarchical yukawa interaction starting from higher dimensional gauge interaction which is after all universal .",
    "one way out is to break the 5d lorentz symmetry in the bulk : @xmath225 where the prefactors @xmath226 and @xmath227 need to be phenomenologically tuned to match the data . for detailed constructions of gauge - higgs unification scenarios , both in flat and warped space , we refer the readers to refs .  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to trigger electroweak symmetry breaking without actually having a physical higgs .",
    "the mechanism relies on imposing different boundary conditions ( bc ) on gauge fields in an extra - dimensional set - up .",
    "the bcs can be carefully chosen such that the rank of a gauge group can be lowered .",
    "the details can be found in @xcite . here , we summarise the essentials through the following steps :    ( @xmath99 )   the simplest realisation is through the compactification of the extra dimension on a circle with an orbifolding ( @xmath199 )",
    ". there are two fixed points : @xmath228 .",
    "( @xmath203 )   bc s : in general , @xmath229 , where @xmath230 is the vev of a scalar field in a boundary .",
    "if @xmath231 ( called ` neumann bc ' ) , then @xmath232 . on the other hand , @xmath233 (",
    "called ` dirichlet bc ' ) gives @xmath234 .",
    "so , some kind of a higgs - like mechanism , characterzied by @xmath230 , is there in the backdrop , although eventually the gauge bosons masses following ewsb induced by bc s would remain finite even in the extreme limits of @xmath235 or @xmath236 .",
    "( @xmath213 )   appropriate bcs are chosen ( for explicit formulae , see @xcite ) which would ensure the following gauge symmetry in bulk and in the two branes : + bulk :   @xmath237 , + @xmath238 brane :   @xmath239 , + @xmath240 brane  : @xmath241 .",
    "( @xmath214 )   the gauge boson masses would follow from the solutions of the transcendental equations involving @xmath242 and @xmath83 . in flat space , the following relations obtain : @xmath243 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 .",
    "but , @xmath246 is quite large !",
    "the reason behind this large @xmath29 is that while the _ custodial _ symmetry is preserved in the bulk and at the @xmath247 brane , it is violated at the @xmath248 brane where the kk modes of the gauge fields have sizable presence .",
    "one way out is to use the ads / cft correspondence in a warped space .",
    "yet , in the above flat space example , relating the gauge boson masses to the gauge couplings is quite an achievement and is a step to the right direction .",
    "( @xmath19 )   recall that without a higgs , unitarity violation would have set in the sm at around a tev .",
    "how do the higgsless scenarios address this issue ? here",
    ", the exchange of kk states retards the energy growth of the @xmath249-@xmath249 scattering amplitude , _ postponing _ the violation of unitarity in a _ calculable _ way beyond a tev .",
    "thus unitarity is kept partially under control .",
    "this can be understood from a simple dimensional argument : in 4d , the cutoff is @xmath250 tev . in 5d , the loop factor is @xmath251 , while the dimensionless quantity would be @xmath252 .",
    "the 5d cutoff is then determined as @xmath253 tev , for @xmath254 .",
    "( @xmath255 )   ewpt poses a serious threat to the construction of a realistic higgsless model @xcite .",
    "all the bsm models we have considered are based on _",
    "calculability_. in all cases , the electroweak scale @xmath141 can be expressed in terms of some high scale parameters @xmath143 , i.e. @xmath256 , where @xmath257 are calculable functions of physical parameters .",
    "the new physics scales originate from different dynamics in different cases : @xmath258 ( the supersymmetry breaking scale ) ; @xmath259 ( the vev of the pre - electroweak higgsing ) ; @xmath260 ( the inverse radius of compactification ) .",
    "* 3 . *   in supersymmetry",
    ", the cutoff can be as high as the gut or the planck scale . both in little higgs models and in the extra dimensional scenarios ( in general ) the cutoff is much lower .",
    "in fact , in recent years there is a revival of interest in strongly interacting light higgs models @xcite .",
    "however , their ultraviolet completion is an open question !",
    "* 4 . *   in supersymmetry",
    "the cancellation of quadratic divergence happens between a particle loop and a sparticle loop . since a particle can not _ mix _ with a sparticle",
    ", the oblique electroweak corrections and the @xmath261 vertex can be kept under control . in",
    "the relevant non - supersymmetric scenarios , the cancellation occurs between loops with the same spin states .",
    "such states can _ mix _ among themselves , leading to dangerous tree level contributions that ewpt either disapprove or , at best , marginally admit .",
    "our goal is three - fold : ( i ) unitarize the theory , ( ii ) sucessfully confront the ewpt , and ( iii ) maintain naturalness to the extent possible .",
    "the tension arises as ` naturalness ' demands the spectrum to be compressed , while ` ewpt compatibility ' pushes the _ new _ states away from the sm states .    *",
    "*   all said and done , the lhc is a ` win - win ' machine in terms of discovery .",
    "either we discover the higgs , or , if it is not there , the new resonances which would restore unitarity in gauge boson scattering are crying out for verification .",
    "for the latter , we would need the super - lhc to cover the entire parameter space . in either scenario",
    ", we would need a linear collider for precision studies .",
