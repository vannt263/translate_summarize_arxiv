    "discovery of the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite and the generalization in terms of the holographic principle have provided us with alternative theoretical methods to explore the physics of strongly coupled gauge matter .",
    "holographic models have been constructed to mimic behaviour of the strongly coupled gauge matter in various situations .",
    "the sakai - sugimoto  ( ss ) model  @xcite is a holographic model which contains chiral fermions in the fundamental representation of @xmath2 .",
    "its low energy limit is the closest holographic model of the qcd so far .",
    "it can also accommodate distinctively the chiral symmetry restoration and the deconfinement phase transition in the non - antipodal case  @xcite .",
    "it provides interesting possibility of the existence of the exotic nuclear phase where quarks and gluons are deconfined but the chiral symmetry is still broken .    in the ss model , there are two background metrics describing a confined and a deconfined phase .",
    "the deconfined phase corresponds to the background metric with a black hole horizon .",
    "the hawking temperature of the black hole is identified with the temperature of the dual  qcd \" matter . when gluons are deconfined , the thermodynamical phase of the nuclear matter can be categorized into 3 phases , the vacuum phase , the chirally broken phase and the chiral - symmetric phase . in the deconfined phase ,",
    "the interaction between quarks and gluons become the screened couloub potential .",
    "if the coupling is still strong , bound states of quarks could form  ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for multiquark related studies ) .",
    "the phase diagram of the holographic nuclear matter in the ss model is studied in details in ref .",
    "@xcite and extended to include multiquarks with colour charges in ref .",
    "it has certain similarity to the conventional qcd phase diagram speculated from other approaches e.g. the existence of critical temperature line above which chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "the phase diagram also shows the thermodynamic preference of the multiquark phase with broken chiral symmetry for moderate temperature in the situation when the density is sufficiently large . as an implication , it is thus highly likely that matters in the core of neutron stars are compressed into the multiquark nuclear phase .",
    "a thorough investigation on the multiquark star suggests higher mass limits of the neutron stars if they have multiquark cores  @xcite .",
    "when the magnetic field is turned on , the phase structure becomes more complicated .",
    "magnetic field induces the pion gradient or a domain wall as a response of the chiral condensate of the chirally broken phase  @xcite . in the confined phase",
    ", this is pronounced  @xcite .",
    "however , it is demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the pion gradient is subdominant to the contribution from the multiquarks in the chirally broken deconfined phase .",
    "it was also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for sufficiently large density , the multiquark phase is more thermodynamically preferred than the chiral - symmetric quark - gluon plasma for small and moderate magnetic field strengths .",
    "therefore it is interesting to explore the phase diagram of the deconfined nuclear matter in the presence of the external magnetic field .",
    "we establish two phase diagrams between the chirally broken multiquark  ( @xmath3sb ) and the chiral - symmetric quark - gluon plasma  ( @xmath3s - qgp ) , one at fixed temperature , @xmath4 , and another at fixed field , @xmath5 .",
    "the magnetic phase diagram of the similar model for zero baryon density is investigated in ref .",
    "the phase diagram at finite density is explored in ref .",
    "@xcite with the approximation @xmath6 .",
    "we found that for @xmath7 , this approximation is no longer valid .",
    "our main results demonstrate that for a given magnetic field and moderate temperature , the most preferred nuclear phase in the ss holographic model is the multiquark - pion gradient  ( mq-@xmath0 ) phase provided that the density is sufficiently large .",
    "we also study the temperature dependence of the baryon chemical potential , the free energy , and the linear response of the pion gradient of the mixed mq-@xmath0 phase and show that they inherit the temperature dependence mostly from the ss background .",
    "extremely strong magnetic fields could have been produced in many situations",
    ". the higgs mechanism in the cosmological electroweak phase transition could create enormous magnetic fields in the region between two different domains with different higgs vacuum expectation values  @xcite which could play vital role in the phase transitions of the nuclear soup at later times . at the hadron and heavy ion colliders",
    ", colliding energetic charged particles could produce exceptional strong magnetic field locally .",
    "the local magnetic fields produced at rhic and lhc are estimated to be in the order of @xmath8 tesla  @xcite .",
    "on the astrophysical scale , certain types of neutron stars called the magnetars could produce magnetic fields as strong as @xmath9 tesla  @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as the following . in section 2 , the setup of the deconfined ss model with additional baryon vertex and string sources",
    "are discussed .",
    "main results are elaborated in section 3 .",
    "section 4 concludes the article .",
    "the setup we will use is the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the sakai - sugomoto model with additional baryon vertex and strings  ( baryon vertex is introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . starting from a 10 dimensional type iia string theory with one dimension compactified into a circle which we will label @xmath10 .",
    "two stacks of d8-branes and @xmath11-branes are then located at distance @xmath12 from each other in the @xmath10 direction at the boundary .",
    "this separation will be fixed at the boundary and it will play the role of the fundamental scale of our holographic model . open - string excitations with one end on the d8 and @xmath11 will represent quarks with different chiralities . in the background where the d8 and @xmath11 are parallel , excitations for each chirality are independent and there is a chiral symmetry in the background and at the boundary . for background with connecting d8 and @xmath11 , chiral symmetry is broken and",
    "there is a chiral condensate . when the energy of the connecting configuration is minimal and",
    "there is no extra sources , we define the corresponding boundary gauge matter to be in a vacuum phase .",
    "since the partition function of the string theory in the bulk is conjectured to be equal to the partition function of the gauge theory on the boundary , the free energy of the boundary gauge matter is equivalent to the superstring action in the bulk  ( modulo a periodicity factor)@xcite .",
    "we turn on non - normalizable modes of the gauge field @xmath13  ( defined in units of @xmath14 ) in the d8-branes and identify them with the vector potential of the magnetic field , @xmath15  ( defined in units of @xmath16 ) , the gradient of the chiral condensate , @xmath0 , and the baryon chemical potential , @xmath17 , at the boundary respectively .",
    "these curious holographic correspondence between the branes fields and the thermodynamical quantities of the gauge matter at the boundary allows us to study physics of the strongly coupled non - abelian gauge matter at finite density in the presence of the external magnetic field .",
    "electric field can also be added using other components of the gauge field on the d8-branes  @xcite but we will not consider such cases here .",
    "the background spacetime of the sakai - sugimoto model is in the form @xmath18",
    "@xmath19    where @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the volume of the unit four - sphere @xmath23 and @xmath24 represents the volume 4-form . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the string length scale and the string coupling respectively .",
    "@xmath27 is the compactified radius of the @xmath10 coordinate .",
    "this radius is different from the curvature @xmath28 of the background in general .",
    "the dilaton field is denoted by @xmath29 which will be eliminated by the function of @xmath30 as stated above .",
    "the direction of the magnetic field is chosen so that the vector potential is @xmath31 the baryon chemical potential @xmath17 of the corresponding gauge matter is identified with the non - normalizable mode of the dbi gauge field at the boundary by @xmath32    the five - dimensional chern - simon term of the d8-branes generates another axial part of the @xmath33 , @xmath34 , by coupling it with @xmath15 and @xmath35 . in this way",
    ", the external magnetic field induces the axial current @xmath36 associated with the axial field @xmath34 .",
    "the non - normalizable mode of this field at the boundary corresponds to the response of the chiral condensate to the magnetic field which we call the pion gradient , @xmath0 .",
    "external field causes the condensate to form a domain wall which can be characterized by the gradient of the condensate with respect to the direction of the applied field .",
    "therefore the pion gradient also acts as a source of the baryon density in our gauge matter .",
    "additional sources of the baryon density and the baryon chemical potential can be added to the configuration in the form of the baryon vertex and strings  @xcite .",

    "since the radial strings could merge with strings from other multiquark and generate a binding potential between the multiquarks , this number therefore represents the colour charges of the multiquark in the deconfined phase .",
    "it is interesting to note that when there is only string source representing quark matter , the quark matter becomes thermodynamically unstable under density fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "however , adding baryon vertex together with the strings makes the multiquark configuration stable under the density fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the multiquark phase is even more thermodynamically preferred than the @xmath3s - qgp when the density is sufficiently large and the temperature is not too high .    with this setup , then the dbi and",
    "the chern - simon actions of the d8-branes configuration can be calculated to be @xmath40 where @xmath41 defines the brane tension .",
    "the factor @xmath42 in the chern - simon action fixes the edge effect of the region with uniform magnetic field as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we can write down the equations of motion with respect to each gauge field @xmath43 as @xmath44 @xmath45 are the corresponding density and current density at the boundary of the background  ( @xmath46 ) given by @xmath47 in terms of the gauge fields , they are @xmath48 in order to solve these equations , we need to specify the boundary conditions . due to the holographic nature of the background spacetime",
    ", the boundary conditions correspond to physical requirement we impose to the gauge matter .",
    "if we want to address chirally broken phase of the gauge matter , we will take @xmath49 to be an order parameter of the chiral symmetry breaking and minimize the action with respect to it .",
    "this results in setting @xmath50 . on the other hand ,",

    "will be set to zero .    in any cases ,",

    "generically , the action ( [ action1 ] ) and ( [ action2 ] ) are divergent from the @xmath66 limit of the integration and we need to regulate it using the action of the vacuum which is also divergent .",
    "the contribution from the region @xmath66 is divergent even when the magnetic field is turned off and it is intrinsic to the dbi action in this background . the divergence can be understood as the infinite zero - point energy of the system and thus could be systematically removed by regularisation .    therefore the regulated free energy is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68(e.o.m.)-s[\\text{magnetized vacuum}]$ ] . note that we need to legendre transform the dbi and the chern - simon action to obtain the bulk action as a function of the non - normalizable modes @xmath69 in order to identify it with the free energy of the gauge matter at the boundary . in terms of the free energy at the boundary , this is equivalent to the legendre transform of the grand canonical with respect to @xmath17 and @xmath70 .",

    "@xcite , it is shown that the pure pion gradient phase is always less preferred thermodynamically than the mixed phase of mq-@xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the pure pion gradient phase , a large magnetic field is required in order to stabilize the generated domain wall  @xcite .",

    "we can study the temperature dependence of the magnetized multiquark nuclear matter by considering its baryon chemical potential and the free energy as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1.0 ] .",
    "both the chemical potential and the free energy decrease steadily as the temperature rises , regardless of the magnetic field .",
    "this is originated from the temperature dependence of @xmath84 of the ss background in the deconfined phase .",

    "the best - fit value of @xmath89 is @xmath90 .",
    "the fittings are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1.1b ] .",
    "this could be explained by noting that the regulated free energy is given by @xmath91 .",
    "the contribution from the first term is dominant therefore the free energy has almost the same temperature dependence as the chemical potential .",
    "however , there is a minor contribution from @xmath92 containing @xmath93 which for small temperature fractions modifies the temperature function in the following manner , @xmath94 where @xmath95 are some arbitrary constants and @xmath96 are given by @xmath97 it should be noted from fig .",
    "[ fig1.1b ] that the temperature dependence is significant for @xmath98 and the approximation @xmath6 is not accurate for temperature in this range .",

    "[ fig1.3 ] .    in the multiquark phase when the magnetic field is turned on ,",
    "the pion gradient is induced by the field in addition to the multiquark .",
    "the multiquark phase thus contained the mixed content of multiquarks and the pion gradient . for moderate fields  ( not too large ) ,",
    "the response is linear @xmath99 .",
    "in contrast to the case of pure pion gradient phase , the domain wall in the mixed mq-@xmath0 phase is stable among the surrounding multiquarks even for small field . the critical magnetic field to stabilize the domain wall in the case of pure pion gradient",

    "figure [ fig1.0 ]  ( b ) shows a linear relation between the pion gradient and the magnetic field which is valid up to moderate fields . for @xmath100 , we found that the slope , @xmath101  ( or the linear response ) , of this linear function depends on the temperature approximately as @xmath102 , and @xmath103 where @xmath104 . the curve fitting is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1.1 ] .",

    "this implies that the multiquark states are more preferred than the pion gradient in the presence of the magnetic field , the denser the nuclear matter , the more stable the multiquarks become and the lesser the population of the pion gradient .",
    "finally we compare the free energy of the mq-@xmath0 phase and the chiral - symmetric quark - gluon plasma phase . for high density , @xmath109 , this is shown in fig .",

    "the phase transition between the mq-@xmath0 and the @xmath3s - qgp is a first order since the free energy is continuous at the transition and the slope has a discontinuity .",
    "it implies that the magnetization , @xmath110 , of the nuclear matter abruptly changes at the transition .    on the other hand , for a fixed field and the moderate temperature , the increase in the baryon density",
    "could make the multiquark phase more stable than the @xmath3s - qgp .",
    "this is shown in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig1.3 ] . at a given magnetic field",
    ", the multiquark phase could become the most preferred magnetized nuclear phase provided that the density is made sufficiently large and the temperature is not too high . in contrast , the effect of the temperature is the most dominant for chiral - symmetry restoration even when the field is turned on .",

    "nevertheless , theoretically we can always find sufficiently large density above which the multiquark phase is more preferred .",
    "the transition line between the mq-@xmath0 and the @xmath3s - qgp phases in the @xmath111 phase diagram can be approximated by a power - law @xmath112 for the multiquark with @xmath113 .",

    "@xcite for the antipodal ss model  ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "the multiquarks with more colour charges  ( @xmath115 ) are less preferred thermodynamically but they require higher densities . on the other hand ,",
    "the transition line in the @xmath116 phase diagram is an increasing function of @xmath70 but weaker than the logarithmic of the density .",
    "nevertheless , theoretically for a fixed @xmath117 , we can always find sufficiently large density above which the mq-@xmath0 phase is preferred .",
    "the high density region is actually dominated by the multiquark phase indeed .",
    "we explore the properties of the miltiquark - domain wall  ( mq-@xmath0 ) solution of the ss model above the deconfinement temperature . the temperature dependence of the baryon chemical potential , the pion gradient linear response  ( @xmath101 ) , and the free energy of the mq-@xmath0 phase has been studied and fitted with a simple function , @xmath1 , inherited from the deconfined ss background .",
    "their characteristic temperatures , @xmath89 , are different from one another depending on other parameters such as @xmath118 , the position of the baryon vertex . remarkably , they do not depend on the field for moderate field strength @xmath119 .    for chirally broken deconfined nuclear matter in the presence of the magnetic field , the nuclear matter with finite baryon density and chemical potential could respond to the magnetic field by inducing a pion gradient or a domain wall of the chiral condensate .",
    "this pion gradient response is found to be a linear function of the field for moderate fields at any density .",
    "however , we demonstrate further that the population ratio of the pion gradient decreases as the density increases .",
    "the other sources of the baryon charge namely the multiquarks finally dominate the chirally broken nuclear phase and most of the baryon density is in the form of the multiquark at high density .",

    "the transition line in the @xmath116 phase diagram is weaker than the logarithmic of the density but nevertheless it is an increasing function with respect to the density .",
    "these imply that for sufficiently large density , the chirally broken multiquark phase is the most preferred nuclear phase even in the presence of the external magnetic field .",
    "the situation when density becomes extremely large and being dominant occurs in the core of dense star such as the neutron star .",
    "therefore it is very likely that the core of dense warm star composes primarily of the multiquark nuclear matter even when an enormous magnetic field is present such as in the core of the magnetars .",

    "<S> we demonstrate that in the presence of the magnetic field for a sufficiently large baryon density , the multiquark - pion gradient  ( mq-@xmath0 ) phase is more thermodynamically preferred than the chiral - symmetric quark - gluon plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagrams between the holographic multiquark and the chiral - symmetric quark - gluon plasma phase are obtained at finite temperature and magnetic field . in the mixed mq-@xmath0 phase </S>",
    "<S> , the pion gradient induced by the external magnetic field is found to be a linear response for small and moderate field strengths . </S>",
    "<S> its population ratio decreases as the density is raised and thus the multiquarks dominate the phase . </S>",
