    "two dimensional electron gas system submitted to strong magnetic field usually form strongly correlated quantum hall fluids .",
    "the fluids are often incompressible @xcite and characterised by dissipationless superfluid flow @xcite and formation of quantised vortices @xcite .",
    "integer and fractional quantum hall states are examples of quantum hall fluids ( qhfs ) .",
    "the distinction arises from an integer or fractional factor connecting the number of formed quantised vortices to a magnetic flux number associated with the applied field .",
    "the fractional factors present richer physics content than its integer cousin .",
    "these include the braiding statistics @xcite and the recently conjectured double boundary layer @xcite . in the same vein ,",
    "the edges of fractional qhfs , under small zeeman splitting , supports spin textures @xcite .",
    "the case of a qhf with the accompanying properties in graphene will be particularly interesting . chiefly due to graphene unique magnetotransport properties @xcite , unusual thz generation and amplification @xcite and observation of anomalous quantum hall states at room temperature @xcite .",
    "another important feature missed by conventional two dimensional semiconductor heterostructures , caused by edge reconstruction , is the unusual edge charge and spin propagation @xcite . in graphene fluid",
    ", there is a parameter window in which the edge reconstruction can be avoided @xcite . in practice , this seem to have paved the way for the experimental observations of charge and spin excitations at the edges of fractional quantum hall liquids @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , quantum interpretations of experimental measurements based on quasiparticle theory revealed that edge spin ( spin - flip ) excitations are more energetically favourable compare to edge charge ( conserved - spin ) excitations and even spin waves in the bulk @xcite .",
    "ability to tune such spin excitations is very crucial in spintronics , which is witnessing an increasing interests through coherent spin dynamical properties .",
    "for instance , dissipationless spin superfluid transport realised on the platform of spintronics device could be very attractive , in terms of large data storage and information processing .",
    "bulk spin superfluid transport has been reported @xcite .",
    "the case of spin - polarised fractional quantum hall states have also been studied for spin reversed excitations @xcite",
    ". however , the main hindering factor towards realising a practical system will be the energy cost .",
    "edge spin transport should be able to overcome the obstacles .",
    "in this work , we study collective excitations concerning spin - vortex dynamics localised at hall fluid edges .",
    "the fluid boundaries are modelled as smooth edges to capture the true double boundary layer property of fractional quantum hall liquids .",
    "this is done in view of quantised euler hydrodynamics theory for vorticity .",
    "the hydrodynamic approach is motivated by the fact that qhf is a manifestation of microscopic properties on the macroscopic scale .",
    "hydrodynamic modes at finite frequencies emerge at long wavelength limit due to slow motion of quasiparticles .",
    "it is also based on its simplicity and ability to properly capture quasiparticles interactions . the new term arising from such interactions , called anomalous term @xcite has non - trivial consequence on transport properties , which is missed by microscopic theories @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic theory have been used to correctly yield exact laughlin states @xcite and bulk charge excitations @xcite .",
