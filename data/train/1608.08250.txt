    "the system studied consists of decane droplets on a glass surface , surrounded by air . because air is 78% nitrogen , we approximate it with nitrogen gas in all numerical simulations .",
    "the glass surface was obtained by cutting a slab with thickness of approximately 4.2  nm from the bulk .",
    "the glass bulk was created using the amorphous silicon dioxide builder from the vmd package@xcite .",
    "the dangling bonds from silicon and oxygen atoms were passivated with hydroxyl ( oh ) and hydrogen , respectively , resulting in a hydroxylated glass surface .",
    "the concentration of hydroxyl was 5.0/nm@xmath15 , close to the experimental value of 4.9/nm@xmath15  @xcite . in the next step a cubic box containing decane molecules surrounded by nitrogen molecules",
    "was placed over the passivated glass slab .",
    "the number of decane and nitrogen molecules and the volume of the simulation box were chosen to reproduce the equilibrated density of pure nitrogen and pure decane , obtained through a set of simulations starting from the nve ensemble , then the nvt , and finally the npt ensemble ( for more details see supplementary information ) .",
    "for the glass / decane / nitrogen system we performed aamd simulations with the nvt ensemble only . in all simulations ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used in all directions . in the aamd simulations the interactions between atoms",
    "were modeled using a classical force field . for decane , charmm - based force field@xcite parameters were used . for nitrogen",
    "the lennard - jones potential plus point - charge models@xcite were used . for the simulation of the hydroxylated glass slab we used the charmm water contact angle ( cwca ) force field@xcite . to account for long - range electrostatic interactions , the reciprocal space particle - particle particle - mesh ( pppm )",
    "method@xcite was adopted .",
    "for all calculations we used a time step of 0.5  fs , a cutoff radius of 1  nm for van der waals and coulomb interactions , a temperature of 300  k , and a pressure of 1  atm . to control temperature and pressure , nose - hoover thermostats and barostats were used with a relaxation time of 0.1  ps and 1  ps , respectively .",
    "all md simulations were performed with the lammps package@xcite .",
    "cgmd is based on an effective description of the system with reduced degrees of freedom .",
    "the typical approach is to represent a set of atoms with a single `` super - atom , '' which we refer to in the following as a cg bead .",
    "the most intuitive way is to represent cg beads as the center of mass of a set of atoms . for glass",
    "we define two types of beads : surface beads and bulk beads .",
    "a bulk bead represents three silicon and six oxygen atoms , while a surface bead represents three silicon , six oxygen , and two hydrogen atoms .",
    "decane molecules are represented as three beads and nitrogen molecules as one single bead .",
    "the interaction potentials of cg beads are a priori unknown and must be determined by using a numerical routine based on aamd simulations . in the present case , the systematic , iterative boltzmann inversion ( ibi ) numerical scheme from fukuda _ _ et al.__@xcite was adopted . in this method , effective pair potentials between cg beads",
    "are determined from aamd with an iterative refinement procedure . in this way , the cg bond length and bond angle potentials for glass beads , and the cg nonbonded potentials for nitrogen beads , nitrogen / glass surface beads and decane / glass surface beads , were obtained . for the interaction between decane beads ,",
    "the martini coarse - grained force field was used@xcite .",
    "the coarse - grained glass surface was built with three layers of bulk glass beads , and two layers , on top and at the bottom , of glass surface beads .",
    "the same procedure as in aamd was followed to build and simulate the glass / decane / nitrogen system .",
    "the only difference was in the parameters : time step of 5 fs and relaxation time for nose - hoover thermostats and barostats of 0.25 and 2.5 ps , respectively .",
    "the shapes of the actual surfaces of simulated and measured droplets were extracted by fitting droplet surface data to a partial expansion in bessel functions of the first kind , @xmath16 : @xmath17 with @xmath18 . to treat the break in cylindrical symmetry due to the afm scan axis , we scale the radius by @xmath19 where @xmath20 aligns with the scan axis .",
    "fit parameters are the constant offset , @xmath21 , the expansion coefficients @xmath22 , and the radial scaling factors @xmath23 and @xmath24 . with four non - zero bessel terms we find good fits to all droplets .",
    "the adsorption energy density , @xmath8 , is defined as the difference in energy density between the droplet on the surface and the droplet away from the surface .",
    "the first term of the difference was obtained from md by collecting the total internal energy of the system and then dividing by the droplet volume . to keep the decane droplet from interacting with or adsorbing on the surface ,",
    "the second term of the difference was obtained in a different way .",
    "a spherical decane droplet was put inside a cubic box and surrounded by nitrogen molecules , and the same procedure described above was followed . in both configurations , the droplet on the surface and the isolated droplet , the same number of decane molecules was used . because the two configurations are not identical , we evaluate the difference in energy density by using the superposition principle : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the droplet volume , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the total internal energy of the decane / nitrogen / glass , decane / nitrogen , and isolated glass and nitrogen subsystems , respectively .",
    "the superscripts `` on surface '' and `` off surface '' refer to the decane / nitrogen / glass system with a droplet on the glass surface and to the decane / nitrogen system with an isolated droplet , respectively .    to calculate @xmath8 for measured droplets , where system energy must be inferred from droplet geometry ,",
    "we assume thermodynamical equilibrium and use a coarse but simple model where , after cancelling terms , @xmath31 the first term on the right hand side includes the contribution from an effective potential energy of strength @xmath32 , which we use to represent the interaction between decane molecules and the glass surface . for simplicity",
    "we assume it to have a constant value extending from the surface to a cutoff height , @xmath33 .",
    "the portion of a droplet s volume that is within this region is denoted @xmath34 and is extracted from surface fits or spherical cap fits , as appropriate .",
    "the second term contains the contribution from line tension and is only applied to the extrapolated macroscale drop with contact angle @xmath35 ( see fig .",

    "the three - phase line tension is @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the perimeter of the contact area . in the third term",
    ", @xmath38 is the surface tension of the decane / nitrogen subsystem .",
    "surface areas are denoted @xmath39 , and we extract @xmath40 from the surface fits or spherical cap fits , while @xmath41 is for a sphere of the same volume .",
    "we use the tabulated value@xcite of @xmath42 . by choosing @xmath32 and @xmath33 to be @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , we reproduce well for md droplets the adsorption energy density calculated in eq .",

    "line tension is only applied to the extrapolated macroscale drops ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) , where to match values calculated from actual droplet shapes , we need @xmath45 . this value of line tension is within the range of magnitudes predicted theoretically@xcite .",
    "the numerical value depends on the details of our model , which we created specifically to be calibrated and then to depend only on droplet topography .",

    "the preliminary cmd simulations were performed first for decane and the isolated nitrogen systems , because the density of the glass / decane / nitrogen system can not be equilibrated using the npt ensemble , as the npt ensemble does not contain enough nitrogen molecules to transfer energy from collisions ( equivalent to pressure ) to the glass surface . as a consequence ,",
