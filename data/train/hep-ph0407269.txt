    "understanding the origin of mass is the main open puzzle in particle physics today . in the standard model",
    "all masses arise as a result of the spontaneous breaking of the 1 gauge symmetry .",
    "this implies the existence of an elementary higgs boson , not yet found .",
    "stabilizing the mass of the higgs most likely requires new physics and supersymmetry has so far been the leading contender .",
    "another aspect of this problem is the smallness of neutrino masses . despite the tremendous effort that has led to the discovery of neutrino mass  @xcite the mechanism of neutrino mass generation will remain open for years to come ( a detailed analysis of the three ",
    "neutrino oscillation parameters can be found in  @xcite ) .",
    "the most popular mechanism to generate neutrino masses is the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "although the seesaw fits naturally in so(10 ) unification models , we currently have no clear hints that uniquely point towards any unification scheme .",
    "therefore it may well be that neutrino masses arise from garden  variety physics having nothing to do with unification , such as certain seesaw variants  @xcite , and models with radiative generation  @xcite .",
    "in such models the physics of neutrino mass would then be characterized by much lower scales  @xcite , potentially affecting the decay properties of the higgs boson .",
    "this is especially so if neutrino masses arise due to the spontaneous violation of ungauged lepton number . in this broad class of models",
    "the higgs boson will have an important decay channel into the singlet goldstone boson ( called majoron ) associated to lepton number violation  @xcite , @xmath1    here we focus on the specific case of low - energy supersymmetry with spontaneous violation of r  parity , as the origin of neutrino mass .",
    "r  parity is defined as @xmath2 with @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 denoting spin , baryon and lepton numbers , respectively  @xcite . in this model r ",
    "parity violation takes place `` a la higgs '' , i.e. , spontaneously , due to non - zero sneutrino vacuum expectation values ( vevs )  @xcite . in this case one of the neutral cp - odd scalars is identified with the majoron .",
    "in contrast with the seesaw majoron , ours is characterized by a small scale ( tev - like ) and carries only one unit of lepton number .",
    "this scheme leads to the bilinear r ",
    "parity violation model , the simplest effective description of r - parity violation  @xcite ( for calculations including also trilinear terms see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "the model not only accounts for the observed pattern of neutrino masses and mixing  @xcite , but also makes predictions for the decay branching ratios of the lightest supersymmetric particle  @xcite from the current measurements of neutrino mixing angles  @xcite .    in previous studies",
    "@xcite it was noted that the spontaneously broken r  parity ( sbrp ) model leads to the possibility of invisibly decaying higgs bosons , provided there is an 1 singlet superfield @xmath6 coupling to the electroweak doublet higgses , the same that appears in the nmssm .",
    "in this paper we reanalyse this issue taking into account the small masses indicated by current neutrino oscillation data  @xcite  ev . ] .",
    "we focus on the lowest - lying neutral cp - even scalar boson of the model .",
    "we show explicitly that the presence of the 1 singlet superfield @xmath6 plays a triple role : ( i ) it gives a model where neutrino masses are obtained from first principles without any type of fine - tuning , even when radiative corrections are negligible , ( ii ) it solves the @xmath0-problem `` a la nmssm ''   @xmath7-symmetry on the non - renormalizable operators  @xcite , or that they are simply inflated away . ] , and ( iii ) it makes the invisible higgs boson decay in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hjj ] ) potentially the most important mode of higgs boson decay .",
    "the latter is remarkable , given the smallness of neutrino masses required to fit current neutrino oscillation data .",
    "we also verify that the production of such higgs boson in @xmath8 annihilation can be as large as that characterizing the standard case , and that therefore this situation should be taken as part of the agenda of future accelerators probing the mechanism of mass generation .",
    "the most general superpotential terms involving the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) superfields in the presence of the 1 singlet superfields @xmath9 carrying a conserved lepton number assigned as @xmath10 , respectively is given as  @xcite @xmath11 the first three terms together with the @xmath12 term define the r - parity conserving mssm , the terms in the last row only involve the 1 singlet superfields @xmath13   has been included in the first row as it is relevant in electroweak breaking .",
    "] , while the remaining terms couple the singlets to the mssm fields .",
    "we stress the importance of the dirac - yukawa term which connects the right - handed neutrino superfields to the lepton doublet superfields , thus fixing lepton number .",
    "the presence of singlets in the model is essential in order to drive the spontaneous violation of r parity and electroweak symmetries in a phenomenologically consistent way .",
    "like all other yukawa couplings @xmath14 we assume that @xmath15 is an arbitrary non - symmetric complex matrix in generation space . for technical simplicity",
    "we take the simplest case with just one pair of lepton  number  carrying 1 singlet superfields , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , in order to avoid inessential complication .",
    "this in turn implies , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the full scalar potential along neutral directions is given by @xmath20\\\\\\nonumber & & + \\sum_{\\alpha } \\tilde{m}_{\\alpha}^2 |z_{\\alpha}|^2 + \\frac{1}{8 } ( g^2 + { g'}^2 )   \\big ( |h_u|^2 - |h_d|^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^3 |\\tilde{\\nu}_i|^2\\big)^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 denotes any neutral scalar field in the theory .",
    "the pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking of both electroweak and r parity symmetries works in a very simple way . the spontaneous breaking of r parity is driven by nonzero vevs for the scalar neutrinos .",
    "the scale characterizing r parity breaking is set by the isosinglet vevs @xmath22 and @xmath23 we also have very small left - handed sneutrino vacuum expectation values @xmath24 the spontaneous breaking of r  parity also entails the spontaneous violation of total lepton number .",
    "this implies that one of the neutral cp ",
    "odd scalars , which we call majoron , and which is given by the imaginary part of @xmath25 remains massless , as it is the nambu - goldstone boson associated to the breaking of lepton number .",
    "note that this majoron is quite different from the one that emerges in the seesaw majoron model , as it is characterized by a different lepton number ( one unit instead of two ) and by a different scale , determined by the combination @xmath26  tev .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : rpv ] ) is the origin of lepton number violation in this model and plays a crucial role in determining the neutrino masses .    on the other hand ,",
    "electroweak breaking is driven by the isodoublet vevs @xmath27 and @xmath28 , with the combination @xmath29 fixed by the w mass @xmath30 while the ratio of isodoublet vevs yields @xmath31 this basically recovers the standard tree level spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry in the mssm  @xcite  .",
    "since neutrino masses are so much smaller than all other fermion mass terms in the model , once can find the effective neutrino mass matrix in a seesaw  type approximation . from the full neutral fermion mass matrix ,",

    "the inverse of @xmath35 is too long to be given explicitly here .",
    "after some algebraic manipulation , the effective neutrino mass matrix can be cast into a very simple form @xmath41 where one can define the effective bilinear r  parity violating parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 as @xmath44 and @xmath45 here the parameter @xmath0 is @xmath46 while the coefficients appearing in eq .",

    "( [ eq : eff ] ) resembles very closely the corresponding expression for the explicit bilinear r - parity breaking model  @xcite , once the dominant 1-loop corrections are taken into account .",
    "note that the tree - level result of the explicit bilinear model can be recovered in the limit @xmath56 . in this limit the coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath58 go to zero , while    @xmath59    in this limit only one non - zero neutrino mass remains . whether the 1-loop corrections or the contribution from the singlet fields",

    "( [ eq : eff ] ) compared to the corresponding 1-loop coefficient .",
    "both extremes can be realized in our model .",
    "we note , however , that as discussed below large branching ratios of the higgs into invisible final states require sizeable values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( as well as singlets not being too heavy ) . for such choices of parameters",
    "we have found that the `` singlino '' contribution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : eff ] ) is usually much more important than the 1-loop corrections to the neutrino masses .",

    "( [ eq : eff ] ) or vice versa . we have checked numerically that both possibilities can be realized and `` good '' points ( in the sense of being appropriate for neutrino physics ) can be found easily in either case .      with the above choices and definitions we can obtain the neutral scalar boson mass matrices as in ref .",

    "broadly speaking there are four types of parameters that are to a large extent undetermined .",

    "in contrast to @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 these are not fixed by fermion masses .",

    "these are partially restricted by negative collider searches for supersymmetric particles  @xcite .",
    "then there are singlet sector mass parameters , such as @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "finally there is the important yukawa coupling @xmath79 , which determines the strength of effective r  parity breaking parameters , through eq .",
    "( [ eq : eps ] ) .",
    "this is constrained by neutrino oscillation data . in section  [ sec : numerical - results ] we will discuss our strategy to choose the parameters in such a way that the results can be easily interpreted .",
    "we will also show there that a fully cubic superpotential , without any mass scale parameter such as the @xmath80 term , also leads to a realistic model  @xcite consistent with neutrino oscillation data . before that , however , we consider the corresponding higgs boson phenomenology , focusing on higgs boson production and decays , and stressing the potentially large invisible decay branching ratio .",
    "supersymmetric higgs bosons can be produced at the @xmath81 collider through their couplings to @xmath82 , via the so  called bjorken process . in our sbrp model",
    "there are 8 neutral cp  even states @xmath83 and 6 neutral cp ",

    "odd scalars for elsewhere .",
    "moreover , here we focus mainly on the production of the lightest cp  even supersymmetric higgs boson @xmath90 .",
    "the main difference between the production of this state and the lightest cp  even higgs boson of the mssm is the fact that ours contains an admixture of the 1 singlet scalar fields @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and its coupling to the @xmath82 is correspondingly reduced by a factor @xmath93 in comparison with the standard model case   in the usual notation . ] . when the lightest cp  even higgs boson is mainly singlet its production cross section in @xmath81 annihilation will be suppressed .",

    "under this approximation we can write the coupling @xmath104 for the vertex @xmath105 of the majoron with the _ unrotated _ higgs boson @xmath106 , in the following form @xmath107    g'_2&=&h h_0 v_d \\frac{v_s v_r}{v^2 } -\\frac{2 v_u}{v^2}\\ ,    \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\epsilon_j^2 \\nonumber \\\\[+1 mm ]    g'_i&=&-\\frac{2 \\epsilon_{i-2}}{v^2}\\sum_{j=1}^3 \\epsilon_j v_{lj }    \\quad ( i=3,4,5 ) \\nonumber \\\\[+1 mm ]    g'_6&= & -\\sqrt{2}\\ , h \\left(a_h +    \\widehat{m}_{\\phi } \\right)\\ , \\frac{v_s v_r}{v^2 } -\\sqrt{2}\\ , h\\ , \\widehat{m}_r \\nonumber \\\\[+1 mm ]    g'_7&=&-h^2 \\frac{v_s v_r^2}{v^2}\\nonumber \\\\[+1 mm ]    g'_8&=&-h^2 \\frac{v_s^2 v_r}{v^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 have been defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : effmr ] ) .    from these expressions",
    "we conclude that @xmath100 can be large in two situations .",
    "the first is , of course , if the lightest higgs boson is mainly a combination of the @xmath108 and @xmath92 fields . in this case not only @xmath100 will be large , but also @xmath109 will be small suppressing @xmath110 .",
    "unfortunately the production would be suppressed , as singlets do not couple to the @xmath82 .",
    "the phenomenologically novel and interesting situation is when @xmath60 and @xmath61 are large . in this case",
    "the higgs boson behaves as the lightest mssm higgs boson ( with moderately reduced production cross section ) but with a large branching to the invisible channel @xmath111 .",
    "the sensitivities of lep experiments to the invisible channel @xmath112 have been discussed since long ago  @xcite and the current status has been presented in ref .",
    "in order to evaluate the experimental sensitivities to the parameters of the model we must take into account both the production as well as higgs decays .",
    "in this section we discuss the numerical results on the invisible decay of the higgs boson in our model .",
    "we start with a brief discussion of the sbrp parameters .",
    "unknown parameters of the spontaneous r - parity breaking model fall into three different groups .",
    "first , there are the mssm parameters , mainly the unknown soft susy breaking terms .",
    "the second group of parameters are the @xmath113 and left - handed sneutrino vevs @xmath114 .",
    "we trade the latter for the parameters @xmath43 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : deflam0 ] ) .",
    "these six parameters occur also in the explicit bilinear model . and , finally , there are the parameters of the singlet sector , namely singlet vevs @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , yukawa couplings @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath69 and the singlet mass terms @xmath76 , @xmath118 , @xmath78 , as well as the corresponding soft terms .",
    "we have checked by a rather generous scan that the results presented below qualitatively do not depend on the choice of mssm parameters , as expected .",
    "thus , for definiteness we will fix the mssm parameters in the following to the sps1a benchmark point @xcite , defined by    @xmath119    we have run down this set of parameters to the electro - weak scale using the program package spheno @xcite .",
    "we stress again that different choices of mssm parameters will not lead to qualitatively different results .",
    "we first consider the general model defined by the superpotential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wsuppot ] ) reduced to one generation of @xmath120 and @xmath3 fields . for the singlet parameters we choose as a starting point @xmath121 gev and @xmath122 gev , as well as @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "we have tried other values of parameters and obtained qualitatively similar results to the ones discussed below .",
    "the explicit bilinear parameters are then fixed approximately such that neutrino masses and mixing angles  @xcite are in agreement with experimental data  @xcite .",
    "slightly different values of parameters are found , depending on whether the first or the third term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eff ] ) is responsible for the atmospheric neutrino mass scale .",
    "both possibilities lead to very similar results for the invisible decay of the higgs .",
    "this can be understood quite easily .",
    "the ratio of the atmospheric and solar neutrino mass scale is only of the order of ( @xmath126 ) are approximately equal to the larger mass . ] and the changes in parameters @xmath127 and @xmath128 are only of the order of the square root of this number .",
    "such a small change can always be compensated by a slight adjustment of other parameters , leading to the same ( or very similar ) final result .",
    "after having defined our `` preferred '' choice of parameters in the following we will vary one unknown parameter at a time .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of the results . in fig .",

    "in contrast to the mssm , where the higgs boson can decay invisibly only to supersymmetric states ( in regions of parameters where the higgs is heavier than twice the lightest neutralino mass ) in our case the higgs can decay mainly due to eq .",
    "( [ eq : hjj ] ) , instead of the standard model channels , over large regions of parameters , given that there is no kinematical barrier for this decay .",
    "we have reanalysed this striking suggestion in view of the recent data on neutrino oscillations that indicate non - zero but small neutrino masses .",
    "we have explicitly shown that ( i ) despite the smallness of neutrino masses , invisible higgs boson decay may indeed provide the most important mode of higgs boson decays and ( ii ) its production cross section need not be suppressed with respect to that characterizing the standard mssm case . as a result , our analysis indicates that invisibly decaying higgs bosons should be an important topic in the agenda of future accelerators , such as the large hadron collider and the next linear collider .",
    "in fact the interest on this possibility goes beyond the model we have taken as framework , it is much more general .",
    "however the sbrp model provides an attractive explanation for the origin of the neutrino masses that can also be probed at future collider experiments through the predicted pattern of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) decays which directly traces the experimentally observed neutrino mixing angles .",
