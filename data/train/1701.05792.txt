    "opportunistic scheduling provides an effective mechanism to improve transmission performance by exploiting channel fluctuations in multiuser wireless communication networks  @xcite . among various scheduling schemes ,",
    "proportional fair scheduling ( pfs ) has been widely adopted since it provides an excellent balance between high throughput and user fairness  @xcite .",
    "thus performance analysis of pfs is important to provide guidelines for its optimization and application . in particular ,",
    "analytical results can be used for admission control , radio resource management , network planning , and so on  @xcite .",
    "there have been several related works in the literature which focus on the performance analysis of pfs under saturated traffic , where the active user set is static because users always have data to transmit .",
    "we can broadly classify the existing approaches into two major groups according to their analytical models of user data rates .",
    "the first group is designed for the single - cell network based on either symmetric relative fluctuation of user channels  @xcite or gaussian approximation of instantaneous data rates  @xcite .",
    "the second group considers stochastic signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) distribution of each user in multi - cell networks and computes throughput with the conditional probability distribution of the scheduled sinr under pfs . the stochastic sinr model in @xcite",
    "is carefully designed using multi - interference analysis ( mia ) and achieves more accurate estimation of user throughput in multi - cell networks compared to the single - cell analysis .",
    "compared to the saturated traffic model , the bursty traffic model is more realistic especially for the analysis of dynamic service quality .",
    "it is important for modeling the increasing web usage which is becoming dominant in mobile networks nowadays .",
    "the packet - level performance has been investigated in @xcite by using processor sharing methodology .",
    "however , their analytical results are limited to the scenarios where the relative fluctuations of user channels are symmetric . on the other hand , high speed streaming services , such as video on demand ( vod ) and video conferencing ,",
    "have become more popular recently .",
    "the wireless transmission of these service types can be modeled as bursty on - off traffic at session level , which has not yet been considered for the performance analysis of pfs .",
    "therefore , in this letter , we present the first analytical solution for the performance of pfs under bursty on - off traffic .",
    "we derive a closed - form expression of user data rates based on ga . in order to improve the accuracy of analytical results in multi - cell networks ,",
    "we then design a hybrid approximation model by carefully combining ga and mia approaches .",
    "we compare the analytical performance of pfs with the results obtained from simulations to verify the accuracy of our models .",
    "we consider a downlink network containing multiple base stations ( bss ) .",
    "we denote the bs in the considered cell as @xmath0 and the set of user terminals associated to it as @xmath1    in each transmitted frame , the bs distributes resource blocks ( rbs ) to the associated users with pfs  @xcite .",
    "the pfs considered in this paper uses the data rate - based scheduling metric , i.e. , the ratio between the instantaneous and long - term averaged user data rate .",
    "we assume flat fading channels such that the rbs within the considered bandwidth undergo identical rayleigh fading . without loss of generality ,",
    "we focus on the performance analysis of pfs with one certain rb .",
    "thus , the instantaneous received power of the reference signal ( rs ) at user @xmath2 from bs @xmath0 is modeled as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the rs transmit power of bs @xmath0 , @xmath5 is the channel gain of path loss and shadow fading , and @xmath6 is the normalized rayleigh fading gain of user @xmath2 from bs @xmath0 which is modeled as a circularly symmetric complex gaussian random variable with mean value 0 and covariance 1 .",
    "thus , @xmath7 is a random variable with the exponential distribution and its mean value is given as @xmath8 =   { p_b}{l_{u,{b}}}.\\ ] ] this can be estimated by the detection of rs - received - power ( rsrp ) which is the average power of the symbols that carry cell - specific rss  @xcite .",
    "a user reports rsrps to its serving bs for channel quality detection .",
    "thus , the bss can make system decisions , such as for resource allocation and inter - cell handover , according to the reported information .",
    "the total instantaneous received rs power of user @xmath2 is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the interfering bs set of user @xmath2 , including @xmath11 independent inter - cell interferers , and @xmath12 is the noise power . the mean value of the total received power is denoted as @xmath13 $ ] , which can be estimated according to the received signal strength indicator ( rssi ) .",
    "the feedback of rsrps and rssis from user terminals can be used to estimate the probability distributions of user sinrs  @xcite .",
    "the instantaneous sinr is expressed as @xmath14    the data traffic is modeled as a semi - markov on - off process that is assumed to be the independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) among users .",
    "we assume that users can fully utilize the link capacity during session periods , and hence they always have data to transmit when they are active under _ on _ states .",
    "we use pareto distribution for modeling the duration of the _ on _ state and exponential distribution for the duration of the _ off _ state , which are denoted as follows  @xcite : @xmath15 @xmath16 here parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 decide the characteristics of the on - off duration distributions .",
    "accordingly , the mean durations of the two states are given as @xmath20    the traffic load is defined as the duty cycle of the on - off process , which can be calculated as @xmath21^ { - 1}}.\\ ] ] specifically , when @xmath22 , the traffic in the system is saturated .",
    "under bursty on - off traffic , the active user set is dynamic due to the constant changes of user states .",
    "however , it keeps steady within the session duration which is still relatively much larger than the rb scheduling period .",
    "thus , we can calculate the achievable date rate of a user under every possible combinations of the active users and their corresponding probabilities .",
    "the average throughput of the user is the weighted sum of these data rates in terms of the probabilities , which is calculated as @xmath23 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the average data rate of user @xmath2 while it is scheduled alone , @xmath25 is the pfs performance gain over the round - robin ( rr ) scheduling under saturated traffic when user @xmath2 is active along with other users in @xmath26 . when the total number of users is high , the computational complexity of is large since @xmath25 is different for each subset @xmath26 that satisfies @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , it needs to be calculated independently for each of the @xmath28 possible cases .    with the aim of tractable analysis",
    ", @xmath25 can be approximated so that the effect of @xmath26 on @xmath25 is only through the number of users in it . to this end",
    ", the instantaneous user data rates are modeled with the gaussian distribution in  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is assuming that the normalized rates are i.i.d and linear in sinr  @xcite .",
    "the former one is referred to as ga and is adopted in this paper due to its higher estimation accuracy for multi - cell networks , which is compared with the latter one below .",

    "therefore , it can not be extended directly for bursty traffic analysis due to the combinatorial complexity problem that we explained after .",
    "we design a hybrid approximation ( ha ) by using mia in the saturated traffic case ( @xmath22 ) and combining it with the ga - based estimation under bursty traffic ( @xmath50 ) .    before formulating the ha model ,",
    "we briefly introduce mia .",
    "it considers multiple independent interference signals separately .",
