    "in order to examine important features happening within the universe , such as light propagation , one has to set up from the start a model for the dynamics of the universe as a whole , smoothing out all irregularities .",
    "general relativity tells that both geometry and matter are important in the dynamics of the universe and , moreover , through einstein s equations one finds that geometry guides the matter and matter changes the geometry .    in relation to geometry",
    ", we now have a good idea of the spacetime geometry of the universe .",
    "it is governed by a cosmological time @xmath2 , which is the proper time of the fundamental particles , usually considered as galaxies , of the substratum .",
    "slices of this time yield , by the use of the cosmological principle , a homogeneous and isotropic spatial geometry , so that the metric is the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric . from observations the universe is expanding , which is then taken into account by a single function , the cosmological scale factor @xmath3 , which once known , also yields the rate of expansion , i.e. , the hubble function @xmath4 , and the rate of acceleration , i.e. , the acceleration parameter @xmath5",
    ". moreover , the spatial slices are flat , or almost flat , simplifying the problem even further ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in relation to matter , we also have now a good idea of the matter content of the universe",
    ". there are three main components , namely , dark energy which accounts for 70% of the matter , dark matter which accounts for around 25% , and the rest , which includes baryonic matter , radiation , and other forms such as black holes , which accounts for 5% .",
    "dark energy and dark mater are essential building blocks in any cosmological model .",
    "their precise nature , both of the dark energy and dark matter , is unknown , but this does not preclude a good understanding of the gross features of the dynamics of the universe .",
    "dark energy @xcite is essential in the explanation of the observed accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "dark matter provides an excellent explanation for the flat velocity curves seen in the outskirts of a galaxy and for the dispersion velocities of galaxies in clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "given there are these two important matter components that essentially drive the dynamics , it is worth contemplate them as a single whole .",
    "there are various manners in which this could be performed .",
    "one intriguing possibility is considering both components as manifestations of a single dark fluid @xcite .",
    "other possibility is to postulate an interaction between them so that the two components although really distinct have to be treated in a broader unified scheme , see e.g. , @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "this latter possibility of a unified interaction scheme between dark energy and dark matter has been followed .",
    "the background for the interaction itself was given by relativistic hydrodynamics theory for the dark energy component and a relativistic kinetics framework for the dark matter component .",
    "baryonic matter is negligible in the context of cosmological dynamics and so it has been left out in the scheme .",
    "the interaction itself between both components has been provided by an archimedean - type four - force , a direct generalization of the archimedean buoyancy law , in which the three - force is proportional to the gradient of the pressure .",
    "the dark energy pressure is of the same order as the dark energy energy density and for this reason , the influence of the archimedean - type force on the dark matter component can be important .",
    "now , the dark energy pressure can be negative , in which case the archimedean - type force can be negative , instead of positive as in the usual buoyancy force case . in the case",
    "the pressure changes sign as the universe evolves , there appear several different stages in its acceleration , in which the acceleration itself can change sign .",
    "it was further shown in @xcite that the archimedean - type force is able to distribute between the two fluid components the corresponding energy content of the universe , which in turn guides the whole evolution of the universe , in its one or several stages of acceleration .",
    "multistage universes have also appeared in @xcite .",
    "the way in which the electromagnetic field couples to gravity is an open question .",
    "usually it is assumed a minimal coupling where simple flat spacetime derivatives involving the field are replaced by covariant derivatives but this might not be so .",
    "for instance , one can replace the flat spacetime derivatives by covariant derivatives along with terms involving the curvature tensor and its contractions , yielding a non - minimal coupled theory . in a gravitational strong regime ,",
    "like in the vicinity of black holes or in a cosmological context , these additional terms , if present , can be felt and are important ( see , e.g. , original papers and reviews @xcite ) .",
    "a simple and most fruitful non - minimal theory , a non - minimal einstein - maxwell theory , possesses an action with a lagrangian which includes a linear combination of three cross - invariants , namely , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are free parameters .",
    "the scalars appearing in the lagrangian are linear in the riemann tensor @xmath12 , ricci tensor @xmath13 , and ricci scalar @xmath14 , and are quadratic in the maxwell tensor @xmath15 .",
    "an interesting fact about this non - minimal theory is that the corresponding non - minimal electrodynamic equations have the same form as the equations for the electrodynamics of anisotropic inhomogeneous continuous media ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this circumstance makes it possible to consider non - minimal analogs of well - known phenomena in classical electrodynamics of continuous media , such as birefringence induced by curvature @xcite , anomalous behavior of electric and magnetic fields non - minimally coupled to the gravitational radiation @xcite , curvature induced cherenkov effects @xcite , and optical activity in vacuum @xcite . of course , the variety of non - minimal effects depends on the spacetime of the model and its symmetries .",
    "since electromagnetic waves , from radio waves , to light , to gamma rays , are a very important source of information about the universe , it is worth to study the changes that might operate in a universe with a non - minimal coupling between the electromagnetic and gravitational fields .        in a generic gravitational background field ,",
    "electromagnetic waves non - minimally coupled propagate with a velocity which differs from the velocity of light in vacuum .",
    "these waves , influenced by tidal interactions induced by curvature , do not travel along null geodesics of the background spacetime . thus , non - minimal coupling may produce significant changes in the propagation of electromagnetic waves .",
    "it is therefore worth to study this coupling in a cosmological context .    in cosmology , in particular , when one deals with a spatially homogeneous isotropic expansion for the universe , one is faced with electromagnetic effects , possibly non - minimal , of two types : first , the phase and group wave velocities depend on the cosmological time , and second , the amplitude and energy density of the electromagnetic waves decrease with time .",
    "different aspects of these two phenomena have already been studied within a non - minimal setting .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the deviation of the photon velocity from the velocity of light in vacuum was estimated in the framework of drummond and hathrell s approach @xcite .",
    "we are interested here in developing the study of the propagation of electromagnetic waves non - minimally coupled to the gravitational field in an isotropically expanding universe .",
    "since cosmological models with dark fluid interaction are of great interest , such as those studied in @xcite , there are now new motives to study anew the propagation of these electromagnetic waves non - minimally coupled to the gravitational field in an isotropically expanding universe governed by a dark fluid .",
    "we mention three such motives .",
    "the first motive is related with the synergy between non - minimal electromagnetic wave propagation and a cosmology in which a dark fluid ( i.e. , a fluid with two components , namely , dark energy plus dark matter ) plays a major role @xcite . in our non - minimal theory",
    "there are three coupling constants @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "these non - minimal constants can be determined directly from a more fundamental theory , as was done in the case of quantum electrodynamics vacuum polarization effects in a curved background by drummond and hathrell @xcite , or they can be considered as phenomenological inputs . of course , the results for @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , in @xcite should be thought as providing a portion of the whole values to the three constants , since other effects can provide curvature induced interactions between the fields , and all the effects should be summed together .",
    "our idea here is that a dark fluid can also support non - minimal interactions .",
    "thus , we consider the parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 to be phenomenologically introduced and do trust that a mechanism of non - minimal coupling between electromagnetism and gravity via a dark fluid can be clarified in the future . in other words , if a dark fluid , as a medium with unusual properties , can act as a mediator of non - minimal coupling between photons and gravitons , we expect that the coupling parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 will be estimated theoretically and established from observations .",
    "the second motive is related to the existence of unlighted epochs in our models .",
    "the non - minimal coupling of the electromagnetic waves with the gravitational field can be codified in terms of an effective time - dependent refraction index @xmath0 , where @xmath2 denotes cosmological time . from this",
    ", we will show that for specific values of the non - minimal parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath16 can be negative during some finite time interval , and can either vanish or take infinite values at some transition points @xmath17 , i.e. , points where the sign of @xmath16 changes , the subscript @xmath18 , labeling the several possible transition points @xmath19 and denoting sign change .",
    "this means that the universe can pass through epochs when electromagnetic waves can not propagate as their phase velocity is a pure imaginary quantity during this period of time .",
    "taking into account that in order to read the history of the universe one should reconstruct the sequence of the events by using the whole spectrum of electromagnetic radiation , we coin such epochs as unlighted epochs , since portraits of the universe of those epochs can not be available",
    ". moreover , the equations for trapped surfaces in the universe have here the form @xmath20 , and they are time - like in contrast to the standard space - like ones that appear in black hole formation .",
    "the use of the term unlighted epoch is then well fit , since it distinguishes clearly the two situations , namely unlighted epochs in the universe versus trapped surfaces in black holes .",
    "the third motive is determined by the necessity to divide properly the history of the universe into epochs according to various physical scenaria .",
    "since the transition points in the universe history are fixed by the critical temperatures @xmath21 of some basic physical processes , one should link the temperature evolution @xmath22 and the cosmological time @xmath2 by using the cosmological scale factor @xmath3 .",
    "when the cosmological time scale is defined upon using relic cosmic microwave background photons traveling along null geodesic lines , the corresponding law is very simple , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is some reference time , like now , say .",
    "on the other hand , when we take into account a non - minimal coupling between photons and gravitons , the corresponding link between the temperature @xmath22 and the scale factor @xmath3 is much more sophisticated .",
    "indeed , it is determined not only by @xmath3 , but also by its first and second derivatives , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "in other words , the temperature @xmath22 is tied to the scale factor @xmath3 , the hubble function @xmath4 and the acceleration parameter @xmath5 . this fact",
    ", of course , should induce novel and interesting features .      in @xcite a cosmological model based on a dark fluid made of two components ,",
    "the dark energy , considered as the fluid substratum , and the dark matter , described in the framework of kinetic theory , interacting via an archimedean - type force was considered .",
    "the evolution models for the universe were classified in terms of the admissible transition points , i.e. , the points in which an accelerated expansion of the universe is changed to a decelerated expansion and vice versa .",
    "this classification is based on the analysis of the function acceleration parameter @xmath5 .",
    "now , we find here that the function @xmath16 , describing the behavior of the effective refraction index , also includes the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "thus , in order to analyze non - minimal light propagation , it is useful to use @xmath16 instead of @xmath28 . in this work",
    "we study , analytically and numerically , the propagation of electromagnetic waves non - minimally coupled , along with their phase and group velocities , in six cosmological models based on a dark fluid which self interacts through an archimedean - type force @xcite .",
    "this work is thus an interesting sequel of @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ cosmodel ]",
    "we introduce the cosmological model . in subsection [ cosmcont ]",
    "we give the cosmological model itself and recall the basic formulas of the archimedean - type model , which are necessary for further numerical analysis . in subsection [ set ] we give the basic set up for non - minimal interaction and light propagation . in section [ optmet ] using the master equations of non - minimal electrodynamics we reconstruct the effective dielectric and magnetic permeabilities , the effective refraction index @xmath0 , the effective ( optical ) metric in terms of the scale factor @xmath3 , the hubble function @xmath27 , acceleration parameter @xmath28 and the three non - minimal coupling phenomenological constants @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11",

    "we also study the photon pathlength , the true duration of epochs and the universe lifetime for these models . in section [ conc ]",
    "we draw conclusions . in the appendix",
    "we analyze a number of one - parameter examples for which the coupling constants are linked by two relations motivated physically and geometrically .",
    "we start from the action functional @xmath29 where @xmath14 is the ricci scalar , @xmath30 is the determinant of the four - dimensional spacetime metric @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the matter lagrangian which we assume includes a cosmological constant @xmath33 , and @xmath34 with @xmath35 being newton s constant and @xmath36 the velocity of the light . using the standard variation procedure with respect to the metric @xmath37",

    "one can call these two periods of cosmological time as standard unlighted epochs . after the last scattering surface",

    "if one takes into account electromagnetic interactions with the dark sector , i.e. , with the dark energy and dark matter , one can expect that unlighted epochs of a new type can appear .",
    "here we described one possible example , namely , the unlighted epochs produced by the non - minimal coupling of gravitational and electromagnetic fields . since in the framework of the non - minimal three - parameter einstein - maxwell model , the curvature coupling can be formulated in terms of an effective refraction index @xmath0 , as we did , we can take advantage of the well - known classical analogy , namely , in a medium with @xmath1 electromagnetic waves do not propagate and their group velocity , i.e. , energy transfer velocity , has zero value at the boundary of the corresponding zone . keeping in mind such an analogy we studied here , both analytically and numerically , cosmological models admitting unlighted epochs , the photon coupling to the spacetime curvature being the key element of the models .    \\2 .",
    "we established a formula for the group velocity , or energy transfer velocity , of an electromagnetic wave non - minimally coupled to the gravity field , namely , @xmath332 , with @xmath333 .",
    "since unlighted epochs with a negative effective refraction index squared can start and finish only when @xmath334 or @xmath335 , the group velocity is zero at the unlighted epochs boundary points . at these points",
    "the electromagnetic energy transfer stops , and thus the condition @xmath336 is the condition to be employed as the criterion for recognizing the beginning and the end of the unlighted epochs .",
    "we have distinguished three types of unlighted epochs : the first one starts at @xmath311 with negative effective refraction index squared and finishes when @xmath337 ; the second one starts at @xmath338 and finishes at @xmath339 with @xmath340 ; the third one is characterized by the fact that at least at one of the two boundaries @xmath240 has an infinite value .",
    "the phase velocity @xmath284 , another important physical characteristic of an electromagnetic wave , is such that @xmath341 , and so , when @xmath337 it can take infinite values at the beginning or at the end of unlighted epochs .",
    "the appearance of unlighted epochs of all three types were illustrated analytically , using a cosmological model with a scale factor of the kohlrausch - type , i.e. , a stretched exponential scale factor .",
    "the unlighted epochs of the first and second types were then described numerically using our archimedean - type interaction model between dark energy and dark matter .",
    "clearly , the appearance or absence of unlighted epochs is connected with the signs and absolute values of the non - minimally coupling parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "thus , fingerprints of the unlighted epochs in the cosmic microwave background data could give some constraints on these non - minimal coupling parameters .",
    "we hope to discuss this problem in another work .",
    "the appearance of unlighted epochs caused by the non - minimal coupling of photons to the gravitational field adds new features into the history of the universe as written by electromagnetic fields .",
    "note that if the universe passes through an unlighted epoch of the second type , we know for certain that information scanned by electromagnetic waves during the preceding epochs is washed out , i.e. , such unlighted epochs act as informational laundry .    in this connection",
    "there is a very interesting question : when and why unlighted epochs of the second type can appear ?",
    "let us note , that quite generally , the behavior of the function @xmath16 inherits the features of the function @xmath60 ; to see this compare the panels ( a ) and ( b ) in figs .",
    "[ pepau][evolutionarymfig ] . in this sense ,",
    "the example of the model with two transition points , see fig .",
    "[ twotranspoin ] , shows explicitly that the appearance of an unlighted epoch of the second type is a consequence of large quasioscillations of the function @xmath60 and thus a consequence of large quasioscillations of the spacetime curvature .",
    "such quasioscillations , in their turn , are the result of the dark matter and dark energy energy - momentum redistribution , induced by the archimedean - type coupling @xcite",
    "the time span of different eras in the universe history can be estimated using optical information . from these durations",
    "one can estimate the distance traveled by the electromagnetic waves through their velocity of propagation .",
    "but then , one should clarify what is the electromagnetic wave propagation velocity which should be used in the interpretation of the observational data .",
    "is it the group velocity , the phase velocity , or the velocity of light in pure vacuum ?",
    "as we have seen these quantities differ in the early universe in an essential way . from fig .",
