    "recently a new measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon became available , which suggests a possible 2.6 standard deviation from the standard model ( sm ) expectation@xcite : @xmath4 .",
    "the theoretical prediction depends on the uncertainties in the vacuum polarization and the light - by - light scattering , see e.g. the discussion in  @xcite .",
    "however , even with a conservative estimate of the theoretical errors , one has a positive difference @xmath5 of the order of the weak contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment , which opens a window for `` new physics '' .",
    "the most popular explanation is given in the framework of susy theories  @xcite-@xcite , since the contribution of superpartners to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is of the order of the weak contribution and allows to explain the desired difference @xmath5 .",
    "it requires the higgs mixing parameter to be positive@xcite and the sparticles contributing to the chargino - sneutrino @xmath6 and neutralino - smuon @xmath7 loop diagrams to be relatively light@xcite .    the positive sign of @xmath8 is also preferred by the branching ratio of the b - quark decaying radiatively into an s - quark - @xmath0- @xcite .",
    "last year the observed value of @xmath0was close to the sm expectation , so in this case the sparticles contributing to the chargino - squark @xmath9 and charged higgs - squark @xmath10 loops have to be rather heavy in order _ not _ to contribute to @xmath0 .",
    "however , it was recently suggested that in the theoretical calculation one should use the running c - quark mass in the ratio @xmath11 , which reduces this ratio from 0.29 to 0.22 @xcite . the sm value for @xmath0increases from @xmath12 to @xmath13 in this case .",
    "this value is 1.7 @xmath3 above the most recent world average of @xmath14 , which is the average from cleo ( @xmath15 ) @xcite , aleph ( @xmath16 ) @xcite and belle ( @xmath17 ) @xcite . for the error of the world average we added all errors in quadrature .",
    "as will be shown , the small deviations from the sm for both @xmath2 and @xmath0require now very similar mass spectra for the sparticles . in the constrained minimal supersymmetric model ( cmssm ) with supergravity mediated breaking terms all sparticles masses are related by the usually assumed gut scale boundary conditions of a common mass @xmath18 for the squarks and sleptons and a common mass @xmath19 for the gauginos .",
    "the region of overlap in the gut scale parameter space , where both @xmath2 and @xmath0are within errors consistent with the data , is most easily determined by a global statistical analysis , in which the gut scale parameters are constrained to the low energy data by a @xmath1 minimization .",
    "in this paper we present such an analysis within the cmssm assuming common scalar and gaugino masses and radiatively induced electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we use the full nlo renormalization group equations to calculate the low energy values of the gauge and yukawa couplings and the one - loop rge equations for the sparticle masses with decoupling of the contribution to the running of the coupling constants at threshold . for the higgs potential we use the full 1-loop contribution of all particles and sparticles . for details",
    "we refer to previous publications@xcite .    in principle",
    ", one can also require @xmath20 yukawa coupling unification , which has a solution at low and high values of the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the neutral components of the two higgs doublets , denoted @xmath21@xcite . from fig .",
    "[ f1 ] one observes that if the third generation yukawa couplings at the gut scale are constrained by the low energy top , bottom and tau masses , they become equal for @xmath22 at @xmath23 , while for @xmath24 they never become equal , although the difference between the yukawa couplings is less than a factor three .",
    "since @xmath24 is required by @xmath25 ( see below ) , we do not insist on yukawa coupling unification and consider @xmath26 to be a free parameter , except for the fact that the present higgs limit of 113.5 gev from lep@xcite requires @xmath27 in the cmssm@xcite .",
    "we found that the allowed area of overlap between @xmath0and @xmath2 can be increased considerably for positive values of the common trilinear coupling @xmath28 at the gut scale .",
    "for @xmath29 the present higgs limit becomes more stringent than for the no - scale models with @xmath30 , as will be shown .",
    "the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon from susy particles are similar to that of the weak interactions after replacing the vector bosons by charginos and neutralinos . the total contribution to @xmath2",
    "can be approximated by  @xcite @xmath32where @xmath33 is the muon mass , @xmath34 is an average mass of supersymmetric particles in the loop ( essentially the chargino mass ) . in our calculations",
    "we use the complete one - loop susy contributions from  @xcite with zero phase factors and the additional logarithmic suppression factor as in eq.([1 ] ) . the calculated value of @xmath2 is shown in fig . [ f2 ] as function of @xmath26 . clearly , it is approximately proportional to @xmath26 and its sign depends on the sign of @xmath8",
    ". only positive values of @xmath8 are allowed for the positive deviation from the sm and in addition the sparticles have to be rather light",
    ". however , light sparticles contribute also substantially to the @xmath0decay rate . in the past",
    "this posed a conflict .",
    "however , if one uses in the @xmath0calculations the running mass for the charm quark , as suggested recently by gambino and misiak , the sm prediction is increased by 11% . in this case the newest world average on @xmath0is @xmath35 below the sm , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "such a deviation is most easily obtained for large and not too heavy sparticles , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] . in the upper part",
    "the scale uncertainty of the low energy scale @xmath36 is displayed by the width of the theoretical curves , while in the lower part the dependence on the trilinear coupling @xmath28 is shown .",
    "the scale @xmath36 was varied between 0.5@xmath37 and 2@xmath37 .",
    "for @xmath38 only positive values of the higgsmixing parameter at the gut scale @xmath8 are allowed in agreement with the preferred sign of @xmath8 by the anomalous magnetic moment . for intermediate sparticle masses and @xmath39 large values of @xmath28 and small values of the low energy scale ( @xmath40 ) bring the calculated values of @xmath0closest to the data , as can be seen from the left hand side of fig .",
    "note that for heavy sparticles ( right hand side of fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) the effect of the trilinear coupling is small , because the stop mixing is small , if the left and right handed stops are much heavier than the top mass .",
    "[ f4 ] shows the values of @xmath0and @xmath41 as function of @xmath18 and @xmath19 for = 35 . for @xmath0the ratio @xmath42",
    "was used , while for the nlo qcd contributions the formulae from ref .",
    "@xcite were used .",
    "the calculated values have to be compared with the experimental values @xmath43  @xcite-@xcite and @xmath44  @xcite , which shows once more that @xmath31 and @xmath41 prefer a relatively light supersymmetric spectrum .    to find out the allowed regions in the parameter space of the cmssm",
    ", we fitted both the @xmath31 and @xmath2 data simultaneously .",
    "the fit includes the following constraints : i ) the unification of the gauge couplings , ii ) radiative elctroweak symmetry breaking ,",
    "iii ) the masses of the third generation particles , iv ) @xmath31 and @xmath5 , v ) experimental limits on the susy masses , vi ) the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) has to be neutral to be a viable candidate for dark matter .",
    "we do not impose @xmath20 unification , since it prefers @xmath45 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , while @xmath5 requires @xmath46 , as shown in fig .",
    "yukawa unification for @xmath46 can only be obtained by relaxed unification of the gauge couplings and non - universality of the soft terms in the higgs sector  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 contributions of @xmath47 and the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath2 in the global fit are shown in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] for @xmath30 and @xmath48 .",
    "as expected , the @xmath1 contribution from @xmath31 is smallest for heavy sparticles , if @xmath0is calculated with @xmath49 , while the minimum @xmath1 is obtained for intermediate sparticles , if @xmath50 is used . with the newly calculated @xmath0values ,",
    "one can see , that @xmath0and @xmath51 prefer a similar region of the @xmath52 plane .",
    "[ f6 ] shows the combined @xmath1 contributions from @xmath0and @xmath41 in the @xmath18 , @xmath19 plane , both in 3d and 2d , for @xmath30 ( top ) and @xmath28 free ( bottom ) . in the latter case the lower @xmath53 contour from @xmath31 moves to the lower left corner , but for the preferred value @xmath54 , which is the maximum allowed value in the fit in order to avoid negative stop- or higgs masses and colour breaking minima , the higgs bound moves up considerably .",
    "the total allowed region is similar in both cases , as shown by the light shaded areas in the contour plots .",
    "the @xmath53 contours from the individual contributions are in good agreement with previous calculations  @xcite , but in these paper a simple scan over the parameter space was performed without calculating the combined probability . in addition",
    ", @xmath30 was assumed .",
    "we repeated the fits for @xmath55 and 50 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] . for smaller values of @xmath26",
    "the allowed region decreases , since @xmath2 becomes too small . at larger @xmath26 values the region allowed by @xmath2 and @xmath0increases towards heavier sparticles , as expected from eq .",
    "[ 1 ] , but it is cut by the region where the charged stau lepton becomes the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which is assumed to be stable and should be neutral .",
    "a charged stable lsp would have been observed by its electromagnetic interactions after being produced in the beginning of the universe .",
    "furthermore , it would not be a candidate for dark matter .",
    "the increase of the lsp - excluded area is due to the larger mixing term between the left- and right handed staus at larger @xmath26 .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath2 measurement strongly restricts the allowed region of the parameter space in the cmssm , since it excludes the @xmath56 solution , which was the preferred one from @xmath20 yukawa unification .",
    "in addition , it prefers large @xmath26 with relatively light sparticles , if the present deviation from the sm of @xmath57 persists .    at large @xmath26 a global fit including both @xmath31 and @xmath2 as well as the present higgs limit of 113.5 gev leaves a quite large region in the cmssm parameter space .",
    "here we left the trilinear coupling to be a free parameter , which affects both the higgs limit constraint and the @xmath0constraint , but in opposite ways , so that the preferred region is similar for the no - scale models with @xmath30 and models which leave @xmath28 free .",
    "the 95% lower limit on @xmath19 is @xmath58 gev ( see figs .",
    "[ f6]+[f7 ] ) , which implies that the lightest chargino ( neutralino ) is above 240(120 ) gev .",
    "the 95% upper limit on @xmath19 is determined by the lower limit on @xmath41 and therefor depends on ( see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) . for = 35(50 ) one finds @xmath59 gev , which implies that the lightest chargino is below 500(590 ) gev and the lightest neutralino is below 260(310 ) gev .",
