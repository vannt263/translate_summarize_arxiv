    "the problem of domain - wall formation during spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetry was emphasized for the first time by zeldovich et al .",
    "( 1975 ) just when the role of higgs fields in cosmology began to be recognized .",
    "this problem is associated with the fact that the observed region of the universe contains a large number of the domains that were causally - disconnected at the instant of phase transition , and the stable vacuum states of such domains after the symmetry breaking , in general , should differ from each other . as a result , a network of domain walls , involving considerable energy density , will be formed .",
    "but , on the other hand , the presence of such domain walls is incompatible with the observed large - scale homogeneity of the universe .",
    "the previously - undertaken attempts to resolve the above problem were based on imposing severe constraints on the parameters or modifying the field theories involved ( see , for example , review by larsson et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "aim of the present report is to show that , in principle , the domain - wall problem may be resolved by a natural way if we take into account the fact that higgs condensate represents a single coherent quantum state , which should experience einstein ",
    "rosen ( epr ) correlations ( einstein et al . , 1935 ) even in causally - disconnected regions during its reduction to the state of broken symmetry .",
    "such point of view seems to be especially attractive due to the recent experimental achievements , such as ( a )  the quantum - optical experiments that confirmed a presence of epr correlations of the single photon states at considerable distances ( @xmath110 km ) , and ( b )  the studies of bose ",
    "einstein condensate of ultracooled gases , which demonstrated that all predictions of the `` orthodox '' quantum mechanics are valid for a coherent quantum state involving even a macroscopic amount of substance .",
    "so , if we believe that epr correlations really take place in higgs condensate , then it should be expected that the probabilities of various realizations of the higgs - field configurations after the symmetry breaking will be distributed by gibbs law . as a result",
    ", the high energy concentrated in the domain walls ( and , therefore , contradicting the astronomical observations ) turns out to be just the reason why probability of the respective configurations is strongly suppressed ( dumin , 2000 ) .",
    "the basic question arising here concerns the efficiency of such suppression for a particular set of the field parameters .",
    "the same problem can be reformulated by an opposite way : what parameters should the higgs field ( and its phase transition ) have for the probability of domain - wall formation to be substantially reduced ?",
    "we shall try to give a quantitative answer to this question in the next section .",
    "let us consider the simplest one - dimensional cosmological model with metric @xmath2 by introducing the conformal time @xmath3 , eq .",
    "[ init_metric ] can be reduced to the form @xmath4 so that the light rays ( @xmath5 ) are described as @xmath6  ( e.g. misner , 1969 ) .",
    "let @xmath7 be the conformal time corresponding to a phase transition . then",
    ", the region of the universe observed at the instant @xmath8 will contain @xmath9 domains that were causally - disconnected during the phase transition ( see figure  1 ) : @xmath10    the higgs field @xmath11 , possessing @xmath0 symmetry group , after reduction to the state of broken symmetry can be in one of two stable vacua ( @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) in each of the above - mentioned domains .",
    "the energy of a `` wall '' between two domains with different vacua will be denoted by @xmath14 ( its expression in terms of the lagrangian parameters can be found , for example , in paper by zeldovich et al , 1975 ) . besides",
    ", for the sake of self - consistency , the periodic boundary conditions will be imposed at the opposite sides of the observable region ( i.e. , the boundary @xmath15 will be identified with @xmath16 ) ; so that the possible total number of the domain walls is always even .",
    "so , under assumptions formulated above , the probability of realization of the higgs - field configuration involving @xmath17 domain walls is equal to @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the characteristic temperature of phase transition , and @xmath20 is the normalization factor defined as @xmath21}_{k=0 } \\ :    \\frac{2 \\ : n!}{(2k ) ! \\ ; ( n \\ ! - \\ !",
    "2k ) ! } \\ : e^{-2ke / t } , \\label{norm_factor}\\ ] ] where square brackets in the upper limit of the sum denote the integer part of a number .    in principle , the problem of finding the normalization factor given by eq .",
    "[ norm_factor ] can be formally reduced to determination of the statistical sum for one - dimensional ising model ( e.g. huang , 1963 and isihara , 1971 ) , which has an exact solution .",
    "nevertheless , to get the most physical clarity , we shall not use here this general approach and restrict our consideration only by limiting cases of high and low temperatures ( in comparison with the energy of a domain wall ) . as will be seen later",
    ", the respective asymptotic formulas can be reasonably fitted to each other .      in the case of high temperature ,",
    "when neighboring terms of the sum differ from each other only slightly , summation can be approximately conducted over all numbers of the domain walls ( both odd and even ) and finally gives @xmath22 so that @xmath23    in particular , a probability of the higgs - field configuration without any domain walls ( which is just the case actually observed in the universe ) equals @xmath24    it is interesting to find restriction on the domain - wall energy @xmath14 and phase - transition temperature @xmath19 for the probability of absence of the domain walls to be greater than or equal to some specified number  @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ; for example , @xmath27 ) : @xmath28      as regards the opposite case of low temperature , when the main contribution to the sum in eq .",
    "( [ norm_factor ] ) is produced by a few first terms , we can approximately take into account only two of them ; so that @xmath29 and the respective probability of the higgs - field configuration involving @xmath17 domain walls will be @xmath30    then , the probability that domain walls are absent at all equals @xmath31 and it will be greater than or equal to the specified number  @xmath25 if @xmath32 i.e. , to a first approximation , it is again determined by the logarithmic function of @xmath9 .",
    "so , as follows from eqs .",
    "[ e - t_high_temp ] and  [ e - t_low_temp ] , the ratio @xmath33 differs from unity only by @xmath34 .",
    "consequently , the required temperature of the phase transition is of the same order of magnitude as the domain - wall energy even at large value of  @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the required parameters may be satisfied in some particular kind of the field theory .",
    "there is no doubt that a considerably more sophisticated analysis must be carried out to draw unambiguous conclusion on the role of epr correlations in the phase transitions of higgs fields .",
    "nevertheless , our consideration , based on the simplest one - dimensional model , shows that such possibility could be quite promising .",
    "moreover , the situation seems to be even better in the cases of two- and three - dimensional geometry .",
    "a well - known property of ising models in two and three dimensions ( as distinct from the one - dimensional case ) is a presence of second - order phase transition at some temperature on the order of the domain - wall energy . as a result",
    ", one can expect that a restriction on @xmath33 , similar to eqs .",
    "[ e - t_high_temp ] and  [ e - t_low_temp ] , will not contain dependence on @xmath9 at all .",
    "this problem is still to be studied more carefully ."
