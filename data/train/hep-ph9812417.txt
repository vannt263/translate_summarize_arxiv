    "the correlator has also been measured on the lattice in pure gauge theory and full qcd using the cooling method @xcite and by making the assumptions of the msv from lattice calculations of the heavy quark potentials @xcite .",
    "the lattice analyses found that for distances @xmath0 of the gluon field strength larger than roughly @xmath1 an exponential decaying term dominates yielding a correlation length of approximately @xmath2 . on the other hand the short distances",
    "are dominated by the perturbative @xmath3 behaviour .",
    "recently , the field strength correlator has also been calculated in the framework of exact renormalisation group equations @xcite .",
    "the gauge invariant gluon field strength correlator can be related to a correlator of a colour singlet current composed of a ( fictitious ) infinitely heavy octet quark and the gluon field strength tensor .",
    "this fact has already been employed in ref .",

    "our paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss again the relation of the field strength correlator and the corresponding heavy quark current correlator . in section",
    "3 we set up the different contributions needed for the sum rule analysis and in section  4 we present our results together with a comparison with recent lattice determinations of the field strength correlator .",

    "the gauge invariant two - point correlation function of the qcd field strength tensor @xmath4 in the adjoint representation can be defined as @xmath5 where the field strength @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 denotes path ordering of the exponential . in general",

    "it follows that the correlator can be parametrised in terms of two scalar functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite : @xmath13\\big(\\,{{\\cal d}}(z^2)+{{\\cal d}}_1(z^2)\\,\\big ) { \\nonumber}\\\\ { \\vbox{\\vskip 8 mm } } & & \\hspace{-3.9 mm } + \\,\\big[\\,g_{\\mu\\rho}z_\\nu z_\\sigma - g_{\\mu\\sigma } z_\\nu z_\\rho - g_{\\nu\\rho } z_\\mu z_\\sigma+g_{\\nu\\sigma}z_\\mu z_\\rho \\,\\big]\\,\\frac{\\partial{{\\cal d}}_1(z^2)}{\\partial z^2 } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the invariant function @xmath11 can only occur in a non - abelian gauge theory or an abelian one with monopoles . in the msv it is responsible for confinement and the formation of a string .",
    "the correlator @xmath14 can be related to the correlator of a local , gauge invariant current composed of an infinitely heavy quark field in the octet representation , @xmath15 , and the gluon field strength tensor @xcite .",
    "the current in question takes the form @xmath16 .",
    "analogously to hqet the heavy octet - quark field is constructed from the field @xmath17 with a finite mass @xmath18 in the limit @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the four - velocity of the heavy quark .",
    "the propagator of the free heavy quark field @xmath21 in coordinate space is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the zero - component of the velocity .",
    "the correlator of the full field can be obtained by integrating out only the heavy quark and leaving the expectation value with respect to the gauge field : @xmath24 the gauge string is left after the elimination of the heavy quarks from the interaction term of adjoint quarks with the colour potential @xmath25 the physical picture of this result is a heavy quark moving from point @xmath9 to @xmath10 with a four - velocity @xmath20 , acquiring a phase proportional to the path - ordered exponential .",
    "the limit of @xmath26 is necessary in order to constrain the heavy quark on a straight line and in order to decouple the spin interactions .",
    "the same relation also holds for quarks in the fundamental representation with the appropriate replacements in the exponential .",
    "the equation ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) allows to establish a relation between the field strength correlator ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) and the correlator for the colourless heavy quark current . by integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom and using ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) we arrive at @xmath27 we may view the composite operator @xmath16 as an interpolating field of colourless quark gluon hybrids and evaluate @xmath28 by introducing these as intermediate states in the absorption part of @xmath28 .",

    "a decomposition according to an @xmath38 classification is more appropriate than the decomposition of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.10 ] ) .",
    "since the spin of the heavy quark decouples , we only have to consider the gluon spin .",
    "the six - component field can be decomposed into tensor structures depending on the only two external vectors in the game ; the four - velocity @xmath39 and the polarisation vector of the gluon @xmath40 .",
    "this leads to the two lorentz structures for the hadronic matrix elements @xmath41 where @xmath42 are hadronic states with the same quantum numbers as the composite current .",
    "in the rest frame @xmath43 , the first structure transforms as a 3-vector and thus @xmath44 corresponds to a @xmath45 state whereas the second structure transforms as an axialvector and @xmath46 corresponds to a @xmath47 state .    through appropriate projections",
    "the two quantum numbers can be singled out from the correlator @xmath48 .",
    "hence , we define @xmath49 the fourier transforms of the functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 are up to the factor @xmath52 the invariant functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively which have been used in the lattice calculations of refs .",

    "let us begin our numerical analysis with the case for three light quark flavours . as our input parameters we use @xmath100 and @xmath101 . in principle",
    ", the coupling constant at next - to - leading order could be evaluated at any scale @xmath88 . as our central value in the numerical analysis",
    "we have chosen @xmath102 .",
    "for the energy @xmath103 of the @xmath45 state we obtain the best stability for a continuum threshold @xmath104 in the range @xmath105 with an energy @xmath106 . to estimate the errors we have varied the scale @xmath88 as well as the continuum threshold @xmath55 . in figure  1 we have displayed the energy @xmath103 as a function of the borel parameter @xmath73 for @xmath107 ( dashed lines ) , @xmath108 ( solid lines ) and @xmath109 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the corresponding values of the continuum threshold are @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively .",
    "the central values have been chosen in order to obtain maximal stability for the sum rule .",
    "larger values of @xmath55 always increase @xmath59 but at the same time the stability region shrinks and goes to smaller values of @xmath73 .",
    "however , even at @xmath113 the influence of the higher resonances expressed through the continuum model @xmath114 is very large : @xmath115 .",
    "for @xmath116 , we have a small stability region around @xmath117 yielding @xmath118 . here",
    "the influence of the continuum model is around tolerable 50% , the perturbative corrections and the choice of the renormalisation scale become however more important there .",
    "another source of uncertainty is the value of the gluon condensate . for the value @xmath119 , originally obtained by @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath120 at @xmath121 , whereas for @xmath122 we obtain @xmath123 at @xmath124 .",
    "we therefore conclude from the sum rules for the above mentioned parameters an energy @xmath103 and a correlation length @xmath125 of : @xmath126    the main sources of uncertainty are the value of the gluon condensate and the continuum contribution .",
    "though the perturbative two - loop contributions to the sum rule are very large , their influence on the value of @xmath103 is not so dramatic .",
    "the corrections tend to cancel in the ratio of eq .",
    "( [ eq:4.2 ] ) .",
    "if one determines the energy from the sum rule just containing the lowest order perturbation theory and chooses as the scale for @xmath127 the approximate value of the energy one finds for @xmath128 the value @xmath129 .    in a world without light quarks , i.e. @xmath130 , the main influence on the sum rule is the expected change of the gluon condensate which might increase by a factor two to three @xcite .",
    "if we perform an analysis as above , we get for @xmath131 @xcite , @xmath132 and @xmath133 an energy and correlation length of @xmath134    for @xmath135 , the energy of the axial vector state , we obtain no stable sum rule .",
    "although the expressions for @xmath103 and @xmath135 are equal in lowest order perturbation theory , higher order perturbative contributions and the gluon condensate lead to a splitting in such a way that for the same values of @xmath55 and @xmath73 the resulting value for @xmath103 is higher than that for @xmath135 .",
    "the analysis of the gauge invariant gluon field strength correlator by qcd sum rule methods allows to establish a relation between the gluon condensate and the correlation length . in order to apply the sum rule technique which consists in the comparison of a phenomenological ansatz with a theoretical expression obtained from the operator product expansion we interpret the gluon correlator as the correlator of two colour neutral hybrid states composed of a ( fictitious ) heavy quark transforming under the adjoint representation and the gluon field .",
    "the former serves as the source for the gauge string in the correlator .    in this approach",
    "the decomposition in two invariant functions @xmath136 and @xmath137 is more appropriate than the decomposition of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.2 ] ) , since @xmath137 receives only contributions from @xmath45 and @xmath136 from @xmath47 intermediate states ( ignoring the decoupled spin of the heavy octet quark ) .",
    "therefore these functions show simple exponential behaviour at large distances and _ not _ @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the perturbative expressions for @xmath136 and @xmath137 are nearly degenerate , but the gluon condensate contributes with different sign .",
    "it stabilises the sum rule for @xmath137 and destabilises for @xmath136 .    the value of the binding energy for the lowest intermediate @xmath45 state ( the inverse correlation length of the correlator ) with three flavours is determined to be @xmath140 and with zero flavours to be @xmath141 .",
    "the main sources of uncertainty are the choice of the continuum threshold @xmath55 and the value of the gluon condensate .    though we find no stable sum rule for the axial vector state we have from the difference of the expressions for the @xmath45 and @xmath47 state strong evidence for the counterintuitive result that the @xmath47 state is lighter than the vector state .",
    "the gauge invariant gluon correlator has been calculated on the lattice using the cooling technique @xcite . there , the analysis has been made by assuming at large distances an exponential behaviour for the invariant functions @xmath138 and @xmath139 , which in light of the present investigation seems less justified than the same ansatz for the functions @xmath137 and @xmath136 .",
    "the results of the lattice calculation are in qualitative , but not quantitative agreement with the sum rule results .",
    "the lattice researchers find correlation lengths for @xmath138 and @xmath139 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 , which are degenerate within the errors .",
    "the computations have been done in quenched qcd and with four dynamic flavours of staggered fermions at a bare quark mass of @xmath144 where @xmath145 denotes the lattice spacing .",
    "they found @xcite : @xmath146    a preliminary analysis of the lattice data based on an exponential behaviour for @xmath136 and @xmath137 @xcite leaves the values essentially unchanged but indicates a splitting of @xmath135 and @xmath103 in the same direction as proposed by the sum rules !",
    "the reader should also note the increase of the correlation length from zero to four flavours which is predicted by the sum rules as well where it is mainly due to the decrease of the gluon condensate .    in another approach @xcite the exponential behaviour of the functions @xmath136 and @xmath147 for quenched qcd",
    "could be extracted by analysing field insertions into a wilson loop and assuming factorisation as in the model of the stochastic vacuum @xcite .",
    "the resulting values for the correlation lengths are smaller than those of the direct lattice calculations @xcite and thus compare more favourably with our results : @xmath148    the sum rule analysis shows that the state investigated here namely a gluon confined by an octet source has a much higher energy than the corresponding state in hqet . a similar analysis of a light quark bound by a source in the fundamental representation @xcite yielded an energy which is by a factor 2 to 4 smaller .",
    "this is to be expected on general grounds @xcite since the case treated here is nearer to a glueball than to a heavy meson .",
