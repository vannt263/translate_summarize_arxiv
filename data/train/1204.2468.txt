    "the no - hair theorem @xcite tells us that a neutral rotating black hole in asymptotically flat and matter - free spacetime is described completely by the kerr metric with only two parameters , the mass @xmath5 and the rotation parameter @xmath1 , which means that all astrophysical black holes in our universe should be kerr black holes .",
    "since the current observational data show that there is still lacking a definite proof for the existence of black holes in our universe , several potential methods have been proposed to test the no - hair theorem by making use of observations including gravitational waves from extreme mass - ratio inspirals @xcite and the electromagnetic spectrum emitted by the accreting disk around black holes @xcite , and so on .",
    "these techniques are based on spacetimes which deviate from the kerr metric by one or more parameters @xcite . only if all these deviations are measured to be zero",
    ", can we ascertain that the compact object is a kerr black hole .",
    "motivated by examining the no - hair theorem , johannsen and psaltis @xcite applied recently the newman - janis transformation @xcite and constructed a kerr - like black hole metric with a deformed parameter @xmath0 , which measures potential deviations from the kerr geometry .",
    "this rotating black hole possesses some striking properties . for example , there are no restrictions on the values of the rotation parameter @xmath1 and the deformation parameter @xmath0 , which means that it is possible that the rotation parameter is larger than the mass of the black hole in this spacetime .",
    "moreover , the radius of horizon of the rotating non - kerr black hole depends on the boyer - lindquist polar angular coordinate @xmath6 , and the spacetime is free of closed timelike curves outside of the outer horizon @xcite . especially , as the deformation parameter @xmath7 , the black hole possesses two disconnected spherical horizons for a high rotation parameter and has no horizon for @xmath8 .",
    "when @xmath9 , the horizon always exists for the arbitrary @xmath1 , but the topology of the horizon becomes toroidal @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic behaviors of such a black hole in the weak field approximation are the same as those of the usual kerr black hole in general relativity @xcite .",
    "these special properties have attracted recently a great interest in the study of the rotating non - kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "gravitational lensing is such a phenomenon resulting from the deflection of light rays in a gravitational field . like a natural and large telescope ,",
    "gravitational lensing can help us extract the information about the distant stars which are too dim to be observed .",
    "the strong gravitational lensing is caused by a compact object with a photon sphere .",
    "when the photons pass close to the photon sphere , the deflection angles become so large that an observer would detect two infinite sets of faint relativistic images on each side of the black hole , which are produced by photons that make complete loops around the black hole before reaching the observer .",
    "these relativistic images can provide us not only some important signatures about black holes in the universe , but also profound verification of alternative theories of gravity in their strong field regime @xcite .",
    "thus , the strong gravitational lensing is regarded as a powerful indicator of the physical nature of the central celestial objects and then has been studied extensively in various theories of gravity @xcite .    the main purpose of this paper is to study the strong gravitational lensing by a rotating non - kerr compact object and to see whether it can leave us the signature of the deformation parameter in the deflection angle , the coefficients , and the observables for gravitational lensing in the strong field limit .",
    "moreover , we will explore how it differs from the kerr black hole lensing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the following section , we will review briefly the rotating no - kerr black hole metric proposed by johannsen and psaltis @xcite to test the no - hair theorem in the strong field regime , and then study the deflection angles for light rays propagating in this background . in sec.iii",
    ", we study the physical properties of the strong gravitational lensing by the rotating non - kerr compact object and probe the effects of the deformation parameter on the marginally circular photon orbit radius , the deflection angle , the coefficients , and the observables for gravitational lensing in the strong field limit .",
    "we end the paper with a summary .",
    "let us now first review briefly the rotating no - kerr black hole metric , which was proposed by johannsen and psaltis @xcite to test gravity in the strong field regime .",
    "beginning with a deformed schwarzschild solution and applying the newman - janis transformation , they constructed a deformed kerr - like metric with three parameters : the mass @xmath5 , the rotation parameter @xmath1 , and the deformation parameter @xmath0 .",
    "it is a stationary , axisymmetric , and asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "the line elements of the rotating no - kerr black hole in the standard boyer - lindquist coordinates can be expressed as @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 + \\frac{a^2(\\rho^2 + 2mr)\\sin^4\\theta}{\\rho^2}h,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath12 the deformed parameter @xmath7 or @xmath9 corresponds to the cases in which the compact object is more prolate or oblate than a kerr black hole , respectively . as @xmath13 , the black hole",
    "is reduced to the usual kerr black hole in general relativity .",
    "the position of the black hole horizon is defined by @xcite @xmath14 it is obvious that the radius of horizon is a function of the boyer - lindquist polar angle @xmath6 , which is quite a different from that in the usual kerr case . for the case @xmath7 , one can find that there exist two disconnected spherical horizons for high spin parameters , but there is no horizon for @xmath8 .",
    "however , for @xmath9 , it is shown that the horizon never disappears for the arbitrary @xmath1 and the shape of the horizon becomes toroidal @xcite .",

    "the presence of the deformed parameter @xmath0 makes the equation more complex so that it is impossible to get an analytical form for the marginally circular photon orbit radius in this case . in fig.(1 ) , we present the variety of the marginally circular photon orbit radius @xmath25 with the deformed parameter @xmath0 and the rotation parameter @xmath1 by solving eq .",

    "our results show that the deformed parameter @xmath0 and the rotation parameter @xmath1 imprint in the marginally circular photon orbit , the deflection angle , the coefficients in strong field lensing and the observational gravitational lensing variables .",
    "we find that the marginally circular photon orbit radius @xmath25 always exists for the cases @xmath9 or @xmath29 .",
    "but for the case @xmath7 and @xmath30 , it exists only in the regime @xmath2 for fixed @xmath1 .",
    "the upper limit @xmath3 is defined by the critical condition that the marginally circular photon orbit is overlapped with the event horizon . as @xmath4 ,",
    "both the marginally circular photon orbit and the event horizon vanish and then the singularity is naked .",
    "the deflection angle of the light ray very close to the naked singularity is a positive finite value , which is different from those in the usual kerr black hole spacetime and in the rotating naked singularity described by the janis - newman - winicour metric .",
    "for all values of @xmath1 , the relativistic images are closer to the optical axis for a larger deformed parameter @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath29 , the separability @xmath92 first increases up to its maximum with @xmath0 , and then decreases down to its minimum with the further increase of @xmath0 , after that it increases with @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath30 , @xmath92 increases with @xmath0 , but near the region @xmath101 it decreases with @xmath0 and finally tends to zero as @xmath69 .",
    "the change of @xmath98 with the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 is converse to that of the coefficient @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , we also note that as the black hole is more oblate , the dependence of the coefficients @xmath66 , @xmath67 and the separability @xmath92 on the rotation parameter @xmath1 is entirely different from those in the usual kerr black hole .",
    "these significant features , at least in principle , may provide a possibility to test the no - hair theorem in future astronomical observations .",
