    "dynamic afm was introduced in the late 80s @xcite as the natural evolution of the first atomic force microscopes @xcite .",
    "thanks to its flexibility , amplitude modulation afm ( am - afm ) @xcite has become a successful dynamic operational scheme widely employed to characterize surfaces at the nanoscale .",
    "it has continuously evolved in terms of achievable lateral resolution and scan speed , producing impressive results both at the solid / gas interfaces in ambient conditions @xcite and at the solid / liquid interfaces @xcite . a complete overview is given by references @xcite and @xcite . in am - afm ,",
    "micro - sized cantilevers are conventionally excited at a frequency close to their first eigenmode .",
    "the oscillation amplitude of the tip is the feedback signal kept constant to obtain the sample morphology during the scan .",
    "recently , the technique evolved in large amount of operational schemes based on the simultaneous detection of several cantilever eignemodes or harmonics of the tip displacement @xcite .",
    "evidently , the cantilever excitation plays a central role in am - afm .",
    "conventionally , a mechanical vibration in the cantilever holder is provided through the excitation of a small piezoelectric element ( dither ) .",
    "the setup is widely employed in many commercial and custom - made afms and permits measurements both in air and in liquids . despite the success of this method",
    ", the cantilever transfer function presents a forest of spurious peaks particularly when measuring in liquids . as a consequence ,",
    "a quantitative estimation of the conservative and dissipative interaction between the probe and the sample is complicated .",
    "moreover , it has already been observed that the motion of the cantilever base due to the acoustic excitation is not negligible in situations where the q - factor is low , a typical situation when measuring in liquids .",
    "the same holds if the cantilever is not operated at a frequency close to its resonance frequency .",
    "several solutions have been proposed to overcome the presence of spurious peaks in the cantilever transfer function .",
    "one possibility is the development of custom - made liquid cells which limit the presence of spurious excitations @xcite .",
    "another possibility is the direct excitation of the tip bypassing the conventional piezoelectric excitation . in particular , in the last decade scientists have introduced magnetic @xcite , capacitive @xcite and photothermal @xcite actuation schemes .",
    "the differences between the direct excitation of the tip and the conventional dither excitation have already been studied and reported @xcite .",
    "consistent efforts have been done to properly quantify the conservative and dissipative interactions when using acoustically excited cantilevers in liquids @xcite .",
    "the proposed methods have been successfully employed for afms based on an optical beam deflections scheme which provides a measurement of the tip bending angle@xcite .    here",
    "we report a general study of the dynamics of acoustically excited cantilevers and lay - down formulas for deriving the conservative and dissipative interactions considering different types of detection methods .",
    "this results in a direct estimation of the conservative and dissipative interactions between the afm probe and the specimen when employing fabry - perot interferometers as detection method @xcite .",
    "a second issue that is addressed in the present work is the consistent advantages that result from the use of approach - retracts curves as calibration method , as done with the force feedback microscope@xcite , versus the standard characterization of the cantilever transfer function . with the described procedure",
    ", it would be possible to ignore the effects of spurious resonances when using optical beam deflection based afms .",
    "firstly , we derive simple equations to quantify the conservative and dissipative interactions in the small oscillation amplitudes regime assuming to know the tip position , which is the case of afms employing fiber - optic based interferometer",
    ". then , we focus on the problem of the cantilever motion coupled with an additional oscillator which may be represented by a resonance of the liquid cell",
    ". both cases where the cantilever is coupled to an extra oscillator at its base or directly at the tip position are considered .",
    "finally , we report a description of the cantilever dynamics when the tip bending angle is measured , as in conventional optical beam deflection operational scheme . the calibration procedure based on the acquisition of approach - retract curves and the derived formulas",
    "have been used to characterize a tip - sample electrostatic interaction , even in presence of spurious resonances in the cantilever transfer function .",
    "in this section we will produce two general formulas for the interaction stiffness @xmath0 and damping @xmath1 without assuming the whole system has a specific transfer function dominated by the cantilever transfer function .",
    "it will be assumed only that all the forces that are present are additive .",
    "consider a point mass which is being acted by two forces .",
    "one force given by @xmath2 and another by @xmath3 .",
    "the two forces add together to make a resultant force @xmath4 , which determines the motion of the mass : @xmath5 which from newton s second law means : @xmath6 if we are interested to know @xmath2 , in the case where the forces are additive , we can put @xmath7 i.e. : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the amplitude of the force identified with its respective subscript .",
    "@xmath10 can be rewritten as : @xmath11\\ ] ] from which we conclude : @xmath12\\cos(\\omega t+\\phi)-a_x \\sin(\\phi ) \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi ) \\label{eq : blast_luca}\\ ] ]    consider that the force @xmath2 has two contributions : one is a restoring force , i.e. an elastic contribution @xmath13 and the other is a damping force @xmath14 .",
    "the elastic force is directly proportional to the position of the moving mass , whereas the damping is directly proportional to the first derivative of the position i.e. to its velocity .",
    "let us define @xmath15 as being the proportionality constant between the force and the position and @xmath16 the proportionality constant between the damping force and the speed of the mass .",
    "hence : @xmath17 which means @xmath18 comparing equation [ eq : last_luca ] with equation [ eq : blast_luca ] gives : @xmath19 if the position @xmath20 of the mass is known , then the total force @xmath4 to which the moving mass is submitted to , ( [ eqfr ] ) is also known : @xmath21 now suppose that the proportionality constant @xmath15 between the force and the position depends on an external parameter @xmath22 , suppose that it can be set @xmath23 and that in the same way it can be set @xmath24 . then in such case : @xmath25 assume @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are all unknown constants .",
    "these constants may have effective values that depend on the frequency , hence we will consider solely the case where the frequency of motion @xmath29 is constant at all times , which is the common situation in am - afm .",
    "suppose also to know @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "then , by setting the above equations equal to zero we obtain : @xmath32 the superscript infinity means that those constants are evaluated far from the surface .",
    "in practice , due to the squeeze film effect , they should be evaluated before the short range forces but at few nanometers from that .",
    "we can then write a final relationship : @xmath33 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\gamma_i(z ) & = & \\frac{a}{\\omega } [ \\sin(\\phi^\\infty ) -n \\sin(\\phi ) ] \\label{eq : final1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have put : @xmath34 the amplitudes of excitation and tip motion have been normalized to @xmath35 which is then one far from the surface . as long as the excitation force @xmath36 remains directly proportional to the excitation signal",
    ", it is not necessary to know its actual value , nor how is the mass actually excited .",
    "it does not matter if the mass is excited by displacing the base of the cantilever or trough a direct actuation on the tip or a combination of both , as long as they remain proportional to the excitation signal .",
    "this formula is valid regardless of the presence of spurious peaks and or squeeze film effects , provided it can be assured the position is given in very good approximation by the expression in [ eq : x ] .",
    "a question that could arise is whether there is any difference in having spurious peaks or not ?",
    "@xmath3 is the force acting on the moving mass .",
    "this force depends on the excitation signal that can be controlled .",
    "spurious peaks will affect the ratio between @xmath10 and the excitation signal as well as the phase between them .",
    "we will come back to this later on , and consider specifically one spurious peak . if the cantilever spectrum has well defined transfer function , then it is straightforward to obtain all constants above from that transfer function .",
    "if the spectrum however is deformed by spurious resonances , then that means that constants @xmath37 and @xmath38 can not be evaluated from a simple analysis of the spectrum .",
    "this does not mean however , that equations are incorrect .",
    "an important note is that even if the resonance curve is calibrated close to the sample , we assume that @xmath15 is the spring constant of the cantilever , so that a resonance frequency different from the natural frequency is accounted by only trough a rescaling of the effective mass and quality factor .",
    "whereas , if @xmath37 and @xmath38 are calibrated , the cantilever spring constant is not fixed to any value .",
    "the above assumption requires in practice that the interaction is linear .",
    "this can be assured by keeping the amplitude of oscillation small enough .",
    "it is assumed the measurement is the position of the particle to which the forces are applied .",
    "most of the afms employ however optical beam deflection schemes @xcite , providing the measurement of the tip bending angle and not the tip position . if the cantilever is directly excited so that the base of the cantilever is not displaced @xcite , then equations are still valid , because in that case the deflection is indeed proportional to the position , implying that the measured signal is directly proportional to the total force applied on the tip . if the tip position is not measured and the cantilever is not directly excited , then equations do not hold , particularly off the resonance or at the resonance but with small @xmath39 factor .",
    "consider now that the cantilever is coupled to another oscillator giving rise to one extra peak in the spectrum .",
    "the cantilever may be coupled in different ways .",
    "let us consider firstly the case when the coupling is at the cantilever base , described by the equations : @xmath40 this case corresponds to situations where additional resonances in the cantilever transfer function are due to the dither piezoelement in the cantilever holder or to the cantilever holder itself . here",
    "the subscript @xmath41 stands for lever and @xmath42 for spurious .",
    "this system becomes straightforward to solve , considering spurious peaks at frequencies close to the cantilever frequency and assuming that nothing else in the system is as soft as the cantilever . if the frequency is comparable to the cantilever resonance frequency , then the ratio @xmath43 is also comparable .",
    "if both the spurious motion is comparable to the cantilever motion , then the situation is such that the term @xmath44 is negligible when compared to the other terms .",
    "this implies that the spurious motion is insensitive to motions of the cantilever i.e. the spurious motion is the same regardless of the cantilever vibrations .",
    "thus , this motion depends only on the excitation signal and is the same regardless of the cantilever being present or not . as a matter of fact , if the set up can not compel with this requirement , then the static spring constant of cantilever could not be used for any quantitative evaluation of the interaction , because in this case the deflection due to the tip - sample forces would not be directly proportional to the cantilever spring constant . as a consequence",
    ", the above condition / simplification corresponds to the real situation . by accepting this ,",
    "equation can be rewritten as : @xmath45 the second equation has a very well know steady state solution .",
    "a spurious oscillation will occur with amplitude : @xmath46 and phase @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "the problem then simplifies and summarizes in the solution of : @xmath48 which has the steady state solution given by : @xmath49 and phase respective to the excitation signal given by : @xmath50 clearly , at a given frequency , the effect of a spurious resonance of the kind considered here is that the excitation signal is amplified by the spurious resonance ( @xmath51 ) and a phase lag is introduced .",
    "however , if the frequency is kept constant , this amplification factor and phase lag remain constant .",
    "the quantity that matters @xmath52 remains unchanged .",
    "the effect of this spurious peak is that , depending on its resonance , the ratio between the actual excitation and the supplied excitation will change .",
    "we then conclude that this type of spurious peak do not affect the measured tip - sample interaction .",
    "consider now that the cantilever is coupled not at the base but at the tip position : @xmath53 this case corresponds to a situation where additional resonances in the cantilever transfer function are due to the fluid borne excitation as described in reference @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath54 represents a restoring force that may be induced by the fluid .",
    "contrary to the previous case , now it is preferable to have a small value for constant @xmath54",
    ". we will not be able to solve the system above but we can rewrite the first equation as : @xmath55 similarly to the previous case , both @xmath56 and @xmath57 are directly proportional to the excitation signal , so they add to give @xmath36 also proportional to the excitation signal",
    ". we may not be able to tell how much is @xmath36 .",
    "however , it is not difficult to see that in this case equation [ eq : final1 ] still holds , except that now @xmath58 . due to the coupling",
    ", the cantilever has a different effective and unknown spring constant . if constants @xmath37 and @xmath38 are determined directly by using a known interaction , then the change in cantilever stiffness is directly taken into account .",
    "the constants @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be calibrated by measuring tip position , oscillation amplitude and phase using a tip - sample known force or using for example a tip - sample approach curve and fitting @xmath59 with equation [ eq : final1 ] as in references [ 22]and [ 23 ] .",
    "the tip position provides the static force @xmath60 , whereas amplitude and phase provide @xmath0 trough the calibrated constants @xmath37 and @xmath38 . an electrostatic force may be easily employed in air for this purpose . in liquids",
    "it can be done for example by measuring tip - sample approach curves , assuming the static force to be conservative .",
    "an intrinsic limit to any calibration method comes from the time dependence of the calibration parameters .",
    "if the liquid cell has an open architecture , the evaporation of the liquid drop affects directly these parameters which are needed to quantify the interaction .",
    "they should then be evaluated continuously .",
    "we employed the calibration method requiring the acquisition of tip - sample approach curves to compare measurements with a conventional acoustic excitation and a direct capacitive excitation of the tip .",
    "we coated an optic fiber , permitting the measurement of the tip position , with 30 nm thickness of gold at its end and 300 nm thickness of gold on its borders as shown in figure [ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "we applied a harmonic oscillating signal @xmath61 around a given @xmath62 .",
    "the force applied on the tip is given by : @xmath63 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the capacitance resulting from the plates constituted by the cantilever backside and the bottom of the gold coated optical fiber .",
    "figures [ fig : figure2]a and b show the amplitude and the phase of the excited cantilever in air ( red ) and in deionized water ( blue ) .",
    "typical values for @xmath62 are 5 v in air and 500 mv in liquid , whereas the amplitude of the harmonic modulation is 100 mv .",
    "the tip - fiber distance is 10 @xmath65 m . at this distance , the force acting on 40 @xmath65 m wide cantilevers is in the order of 10 nn / v in static conditions in air . in water",
    "no capacitive force acting on the cantilever was observed in quasi - static conditions , whereas figure [ fig : figure2]a shows the presence of capacitive actuation at frequencies higher than 1 khz .",
    "the diameter of the optic fiber is 125 @xmath65 m .",
    "the cantilevers have nominal spring constant of 0.8 n / m .",
    "figures [ fig : figure2]a and b show the amplitude and the phase of the cantilever in liquid with a direct excitation of the tip ( blue ) and with a conventional piezoelectric excitation ( black ) , showing the presence of spurious resonances .",
    "we acquired approach force curves in force feedback mode @xcite at the mica / deionized water interface . the oscillation amplitude imposed to",
    "the tip is 0.3 nm .",
    "the amplitude and the phase were recorded and converted into conservative and dissipative interactions using equations [ eq : final1 ] and the equality @xmath66 , assuming the static force to be fully conservative .",
    "constants @xmath37 and @xmath38 were determined .",
    "then , we performed the same measurements exciting the tip with the same oscillation amplitude and with the conventional piezoelectric excitation . even in presence of spurious peaks",
    ", we converted the amplitude and phase into conservative and dissipative interactions , providing new @xmath37 and @xmath38 parameters .",
    "figure [ fig : figure3]a shows the static force measured while the tip was electrically excited ( blue ) and piezoelectric excited ( red ) .",
    "the elastic force gradient and the dissipation are shown in figure [ fig : figure3]b and [ fig : figure3]c .",
    "providing the same results in terms force gradient and dissipation , the main difference between the two excitation methods is then solely given by the calibration parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 evaluated through the equality @xmath66 .    in the case of electrostatic excitation",
    ", we obtained @xmath38 = 0.05 rad , @xmath37 = 2.2n / m .",
    "for the conventional acoustic excitation , we have @xmath38 = 0.006 rad , @xmath37 = 0.06n / m .",
    "if the measurement is not directly proportional to the position of the cantilever but only proportional to its deflection , then the displacement of the base has to be added to the measured signal .",
    "we can start by considering equation [ eq : kigi1 ] and simply recomputing both @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the position of the moving mass is given by its deflection plus the motion of the base : @xmath69 .",
    "where @xmath70 is the amplitude of the measured signal and @xmath71 the oscillation amplitude of the cantilever anchoring point .",
    "equation [ eq : kigi1 ] becomes : @xmath72}{a_m^2+a_b^2 + 2 a_b",

    "the measured signal corresponds to the position of the moving tip , in which case the terms with @xmath71 do not appear in the equation .",
    "it is assured that the base of the cantilever does not move ( direct excitation ) , in which case @xmath73 .",
    "3 .   it is a very good approximation to state that @xmath74 ( @xmath71 is negligible compared to @xmath70 ) . which is true close to the resonance frequency when the cantilever quality factor is large enough .",
    "interestingly , it means that to be able to use the equations described in the first part ( [ eq : final1 ] ) , it is convenient to either make a direct excitation of the cantilever or to measure directly a signal proportional to its position . in the last case",
    ", it becomes irrelevant how the moving mass is excited .",
    "there is one particular case worth noting when the excitation force is solely due to the cantilever base displacement . in this case",
    "it is @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) .",
    "let us also define the proportionality constant @xmath77 such that @xmath78 . here",
    ", @xmath77 is a constant such that in the absence of tip - sample interactions the normalized amplitude ( @xmath35 ) is one .",
    "equations [ eq : comp ] then become : @xmath79 far from the sample surface there are no short range sample interactions and equations must evaluate to zero .",
    "we can solve equations to find @xmath80 and @xmath77 that are constants : @xmath81 then , the tip - sample interaction is given by : @xmath82 this highlights the fact that if the cantilever spring constant @xmath15 is known , then the evaluation of either @xmath16 and @xmath26 or @xmath77 and @xmath38 is needed to quantify the interaction .",
    "the first couple can be found trough a resonance curve if it is well defined in the spectrum . in that case",
    "one can compute @xmath77 from the expression above .",
    "the second couple can be found by taking a calibration curve using a known force or using for example an approach curve and fitting @xmath66 as in [ 22,23 ] . in air",
    "it is straightforward to calibrate these parameters using an electrostatic force .",
    "if it is not possible to obtain these values from the resonance curve because the spectrum is very deformed , that does not mean these equations do not hold .    finally , some considerations regarding the case where @xmath83 . first note that this situation poses no difficulty in the case where the tip motion is measured instead of the cantilever deflection .",
    "it is more complicated in the case of beam deflection because equation [ eq : comp ] is more difficult to analyze .",
    "the values of @xmath36 and @xmath71 , or their ratios , are not acquired from a conventional analysis of the transfer function nor from fitting the brownian motion of the cantilever .",
    "also note that this is exactly the case where piezoelectric actuation is used and liquid borne excitation is not negligible .",

    "furthermore , this particular holder shows many spurious resonances .",
    "three approach curves were taken at selected arbitrary frequencies as shown in figure 4b .",

    "we have used equations [ eq : comp_luca2 ] to account for the interaction . as shown in figure 4e",

    "this result clearly shows that a calibration method is advantageous compared to a conventional analysis of the transfer function .",
