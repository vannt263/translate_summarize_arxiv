    "is 71  mjy at 1.6  ghz .",
    "when compared with the fluxes of b1 and b2 here at 8.4  ghz , this yields a spectral index for that region of @xmath340.25 .",
    "high dynamic range imaging at 15  ghz should provide a positive identification .",
    "polarization was detected in the southern hotspot at 8.4  ghz with an intensity of 2.1  mjy ( see fig .",
    "this is 1.2% of the intensity of the hotspot .",
    "there is no detectable polarization at 4.8  ghz down to the 3@xmath27 level ( @xmath6 0.2  mjy , or 0.06% ) .",
    "the 4.8  ghz image also shows a strange morphology in the southern lobe .",
    "there appears to be a hole , or depression , in the emission below the bright hotspot .",
    "if this is not an artifact in the data , it resembles the region in the eastern lobe of 4c  31.04 by @xcite , where it is speculated that such a hole could be created by a dense molecular gas that is impenetrable to radio emission or to the plasma itself .",
    "however , the morphology may also be the effect of edge - brightening at component c if the plasma is running into denser material . this material may also be deflecting the jet to the east , as seen in the 8.4  ghz image .",
    "polarization was only detected at 8.4  ghz , so the rm could not be determined and the true orientation of the magnetic field is not known .",
    "if the rm was known to be as low as in j1826 + 1831 ( @xmath1180  rad  m@xmath3 , see @xmath283.2 ) , for example , then there would be little rotation from the original polarization angle to 8.4  ghz , so the magnetic field would lie roughly perpendicular to the electric vectors in figure 1a .",
    "then , the detectable polarization in this region would be due to a compression of the ambient magnetic field at a shock front where the jet is colliding with the denser gas .",
    "future observations at 15 ghz should allow us to determine the rotation measure for this region .",
    "the fourth epoch of 8.4  ghz data in the proper motion study of this object did not provide a good fit for the separation speed of the hotspots .",
    "however , there is an upper limit of 0.066  mas  yr@xmath11 of component a away from component c. this speed limit and a hotspot distance of 40.33  mas provides a lower limit for the kinematic age of 610  yrs .",
    "this is higher than was previously estimated ( 280  yrs in gtpg ) .",
    "although the redshift is not known , a reasonable estimate of @xmath35  0.5 can be made for the typical redshift of a cso host @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the projected distance between components a and c is 242  pc and a is moving with speed @xmath36 2.0@xmath37 .",
    "this is the most significantly polarized of these three objects .",
    "component c , most likely a jet component , has a polarized intensity of 2.3  mjy at 8.4  ghz , or 8.5% of its flux ( see fig .",
    "this component has a polarized intensity of 1.4  mjy at 4.8  ghz , making it 3.7% polarized .",
    "a least - squares fit for the rotation measure of @xmath1180@xmath210  rad  m@xmath3 at the peak of component c is presented in figure 3 .",
    "this is not an uncommon rotation measure for a typical quasar jet @xcite .",
    "the pair of angles at 8.2 and 8.5  ghz suggest a higher rotation measure , but this requires for a number of 180 degree turns to be put in between 4.6 and 5.0  ghz and between 5.0  ghz and 8.2  ghz .",
    "these turns can be introduced because the polarization vectors give an orientation , but not a direction , of the electric field such that @xmath15 and @xmath38180 are indistinguishable .",
    "depending on the number of turns used in this data , rotation measures as high as 6000  rad  m@xmath3 are plausible .",
    "one must take caution with this , however , since any number of turns can be introduced to provide a false good fit .",
    "therefore , @xmath1180@xmath210  rad  m@xmath3 is a conservative estimate .",
    "measurement of polarization at another frequency may help in determining the correct rotation measure .",
    "it may also be true , however , that we only see polarized emission from this component because it is free of the high rotation measures that may be present closer to the core .",
    "if a path length of 0.3  pc is assumed with n@xmath39 10@xmath24  @xmath22 , the magnetic field strength is 0.7  @xmath4 g , using eqn .  2 .",
    "with the upper limit of the path length , 10  pc , the field strength is only 0.03  @xmath4 g",
    ". both of these are much smaller than the strength of a magnetic field that is in pressure balance with a 10@xmath25  k gas of the same electron density , @xmath6200  @xmath4 g , using eqn .",
    "a spectral index map was made between 4.8 and 8.4  ghz which is presented in figure 2 .",
    "this shows the core , b , to be a flat spectrum component ( @xmath40 0.6 ) , while the rest of the jet and counterjet are steep spectrum ( @xmath40 @xmath10.6 to @xmath11.7 ) .    the proper motions of components c and d with respect to b were measured using the four epochs of 8.4  ghz data available to us .",
    "d was found to be moving at 0.015@xmath20.003  mas  yr@xmath11 . with a projected separation between b and d of 41.87 mas",
    ", this corresponds to a kinematic age for the cso of 2600@xmath2490  yr .",
    "this refines our earlier estimate of 3000@xmath21490  yr . the jet component c is moving along at a faster rate of 0.032@xmath20.003  mas  yr@xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "the modelfitting of components works best for bright , compact components , of which component a is neither , so no proper motions can be fit . if we assume again that @xmath41 0.5 , d is moving away from b at @xmath60.45@xmath37 and is 255  pc away .",
    "c is moving away from b at @xmath60.95@xmath37 .",
    "however , this source has no detected optical counterpart , so its redshift could be much higher .",
    "this new cso candidate was first listed in a survey with the 300-ft green bank telescope at 4.8  ghz by @xcite it was observed in the second caltech - jodrell bank survey ( cj2 ) which presented a spectrum of total intensity in @xcite .",
    "its host is a seyfert  1 galaxy with a magnitude of 18.2 and redshift of @xmath42 0.486 @xcite .",
    "new observations were taken with the vlba to investigate the non - linear morphology in the cj2 image .",
    "we identify component a as a steep spectrum hotspot ( @xmath430.9 ; see fig .",
    "6 ) that dominates the flux of this object at all four frequencies .",
    "components b and c are steep spectrum ( @xmath40 @xmath11.2 and @xmath10.9 , respectively ) , and we propose that they are also part of the eastern lobe .",
    "component d is very steep spectrum ( @xmath44 @xmath11.6 ) , and , based on morphology , we propose it to be the counter - hotspot to a. there is no evidence of a compact , flat or inverted spectrum core , but there are a growing number of csos that have two steep spectrum hotspots but no visible core ( e.g. j0620 + 2102 , j1111 + 1955 ; gtpg ) .",
    "there is also a trail of extended emission between a and d at 4.8 and 8.4  ghz that hints at a jet - like structure , as well as emission further east of a in the 4.8  ghz image which we interpret as a sign of earlier activity ( see fig .",
    "although the morphology is similar to that of a cso , the hotspot intensity ratio at 4.8  ghz is 12:1 and is 26:1 at 8.4  ghz .",
    "these fall short of the 10:1 criteria set for csos in the coins sample @xcite .",

    "the minimum energy magnetic field of the plasma can be calculated as in @xcite using @xmath45 where b is in gauss , @xmath46 is in ghz , f@xmath47 is in jy , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the dimensions of an elliptical component in arcseconds , and @xmath50 is the path length in kpc . with this , the synchrotron age of the source can be calculated as in @xcite with @xmath51[\\nu_{br}(1+z)]^{1/2}}}\\ ] ] with b in @xmath4 g , @xmath52 in ghz , and @xmath53 3.25(1@xmath54)@xmath55 . at 4.8  ghz ,",
    "the eastern hotspot is 0.291  jy and can be approximated by an ellipse 0.01  mas by 0.006  mas .",
    "we assume the path length to be equivalent to 0.01  mas , or 0.07  kpc at a redshift of 0.486 .",
    "this yields a magnetic field of @xmath67  mg and a synchrotron age of @xmath6540  yrs .",
    "component a is polarized at 8.4  ghz ( 3.0  mjy or 1.6% ) , 15.1  ghz ( 2.3  mjy or 2.8% ) , and 22.2  ghz ( 1.8  mjy or 4.0% ) .",

    "a plot of the rotation measure is given in figure 7 .",
    "the rotation measure of 1540@xmath27  rad  m@xmath3 comes from a direct measurement of the evpas at the center of the polarized component without any introduced 180 degree wraps .",
    "this is more consistent with the high rms expected from a cso . with a path length of 0.3  pc and the same electron density as above",
    ", this corresponds to a magnetic field strength of 6  @xmath4 g . at the upper limit for path length of 10  pc ,",
    "the magnetic field strength is 0.2  @xmath4 g . these are still much lower than what is expected in the central regions of a radio galaxy ( 200  @xmath4 g , see @xmath283.2 ) .",

    "this apparent speed corresponds to 1.02@xmath20.11  @xmath37 .",
    "although this is higher than typical hotspot separation speeds ( gtpg ) , it yields a good fit ( see fig . 8) and a kinematic age of 940@xmath2110  yr .",
    "depolarization in csos is consistent with the @xcite model .",
    "variations in rotation measure across the lobe can cause this depolarization , and this may be due to magnetic field reversals in the post - shock ism .",
    "the obscuring torus may also play a role in depolarization , and this would be dependent on torus scale height , opening angle , and orientation .",
    "we rule out depolarization by a thin disk of material , with a scale height much less than the radio source size , since we frequently see that both sides are depolarized , whereas a thin disk would only cover one side .",
    "if a faraday screen is to produce the observed polarization asymmetry in these sources , then it requires a scale height of about half the total source size .",
    "more detections of polarization in csos are needed to constrain its geometry .",
    "the existence of polarized emission in these three sources sets them apart from the rest of the coins sample .",
    "however , this is not the only difference . in gtpg",
    ", we noted that j0000@xmath04054 and j1826@xmath01831 appeared to have greater hotspot intensity ratios than their unpolarized counterparts .",
    "since the polarization is detected on the side of the more prominent hotspot , this can be attributed to a shorter path length through the circumnuclear torus and , consequently , a lower faraday depth .",
    "table 4 lists the brightnesses of each hotspot and the ratio of the dimmer one to the brighter one for unpolarized and polarized csos .",
    "there is a bimodal distribution in that the polarized sources presented in this paper have ratios @xmath80.1 and the unpolarized coins have ratios @xmath570.3 . although the sample size for polarized csos is small , this is consistent with the observed polarization being due to an orientation effect . as the angle between the jet axis and line of sight decreases ,",
    "the forward hotspot may be more doppler boosted and the receding hotspot doppler dimmed , assuming mildly relativistic bulk motions .",
    "so , the leading hotspots in the three polarized sources are oriented such that they are relatively free from faraday depolarization by the torus that surrounds the central region .",
    "however , to explain the depolarization over many viewing angles in the other csos , a large torus is needed to extend over hundreds of parsecs of jets and lobe .",
    "hi absorption has been seen at this distance from the central engine ( e.g. 1946 + 708 * ? ? ?",
    "in order to quantify depolarization in csos , we look at faraday beam depolarization",
    ". we can calculate the necessary rotation measure gradient across the synthesized beam in order to get a rotation of one radian . for the unpolarized csos in the coins sample , with an average beamwidth of 1.5  mas at 8.4  ghz ,",
    "the rm gradient need only be @xmath6500  rad  m@xmath3  mas@xmath11 .",
    "so , the rm of j1915@xmath06548 may be reasonable for a cso , whereas the low rotation measure of j1826@xmath01831 is still puzzling .",
    "an rm of 500  rad  m@xmath3 corresponds to a magnetic field strength of 2  @xmath4 g with a path length of 0.3  pc and 0.06  @xmath4 g with 10  pc .",
    "these are still much lower than the strength of a magnetic field in pressure balance with a 10@xmath25  k gas .",
    "we use the assumption that relativistic beaming is in effect to quantify the orientations of these sources .",
    "we can match up what appear to be jet components from the approaching and receding sides of the core and compare their fluxes ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) as @xmath60 where @xmath29 is the space velocity , @xmath30 is the angle to the line of sight , @xmath61 is the spectral index , and @xmath62 is either 2 or 3 .",

    "one can use @xmath64 where @xmath4 is the apparent motion and @xmath65 is the distance from the core .",
    "however , this requires a well known position for the center of activity .",
    "one can also use the hotspot separation , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the angular size distance to the source , @xmath68 is the redshift , and @xmath69 is the angular separation speed in units of @xmath37 @xcite .",

    "note that these two equations have a similar functional form , so no tight constraints can be determined .",

    "the true space velocity will be @xmath570.3  @xmath37 for any angle .",

    "we used the apparent hotspot separation speed of 1.02@xmath20.11@xmath37 for j1915@xmath06548 , @xmath740.486 , and eqn .  8 to plot the locus for @xmath29 and @xmath30 in figure  9c along with the loci for the two brightness models with eqn .",
    "these two sets of curves intersect when @xmath75 0.55 and @xmath76 50 .",
    "such a high space velocity is uncharacteristic of lobes .",
    "however , it is possible that the hotspot being measured is a transient feature , and therefore moving more quickly , whereas the lobe as a whole is moving at a much slower speed .",
    "this can occur if the jet that is feeding the hotspot has changed its orientation slightly and is drilling out a new part of the lobe @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we may be measuring the separation of jet components rather than hotspots as there may be no visible hotspots .",
    "this example shows how the orientation angle of a cso can be measured if mild relativistic beaming is a factor .",
    "an alternate theory for the small sizes of csos is that they are old sources frustrated by a dense medium @xcite .",
    "this dense medium may in fact be asymmetric , possibly as a result of a galaxy merger or interaction @xcite . in an extreme case",
    ", the ages of these sources would be comparable to the ages of larger , classic radio doubles .",
    "@xcite pointed out that if this were the case , csos would have more spherical morphologies . also , hotspot separation speeds in @xcite and gtpg show that the hotspots are still moving too quickly to be confined by a dense medium and be older than a few thousand years .",
    "however , this does not rule out high densities or asymmetries in the medium around csos as evidence by @xcite .",
    "@xcite propose that csos are frustrated but not confined by the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "their model assumes a dentist - drill explanation for jet - lobe interactions and predicts low polarization .",
    "this is because the ionized gas surrounding the lobes in this model produces large variations in faraday rotation measures across the source , thus depolarizing the emission .",
    "interstellar magnetic fields can play an integral role if there are a large number of magnetic field reversals across the source which would produce a varied rm structure in our maps .",
    "since the polarization is spatially isolated in these csos , no such maps can be made .",
    "asymmetries in the cso environment may cause one hotspot to be considerably more polarized in these few sources by interactions with a dense ism .",
    "if the evpas for j1915 + 6548 are extrapolated back to zero wavelength , the observed angle of the electric field is @xmath188@xmath72 .",
    "so , the orientation of the magnetic field in the image would be nearly north - south , which is approximately perpendicular to the source orientation .",
    "this may be an indication of a collision between the bright hotspot and a dense medium that orders the magnetic field along the axis of compression .",
    "this is also observed in j1826@xmath01831 where the evpa at zero wavelength is 75@xmath72 , so the magnetic field is oriented at @xmath125@xmath72 .",
    "this is also nearly perpendicular to the source orientation , but this effect is for the bright jet component , not the hotspot . components may also be brighter ( by doppler boosting ) if they are moving more quickly through a less dense ism .",
    "however , the indistinguishable motions of the polarized component in j0000@xmath04054 seems to refute that .",
    "this asymmetry in environments does not , however , explain the bimodal distribution in table  4 , that is , the fact that the ratios of the dimmer hotspots to the brighter hotspots of each source are much lower for polarized csos than for unpolarized csos .",
    "this is more naturally explained by doppler boosting .",
    "also , the relativistic hotspot speeds of j1915 + 6548 ( see fig .  9 ) could not exist in a dense environment .",
    "finally , we do not see rotation measures in the several thousands as predicted by the @xcite model .",
    "in this study we have investigated the polarization properties of two csos , j0000@xmath04054 and j1826@xmath01831 , and a cso candidate j1915@xmath06548 .",
    "the faraday rotation measures that were observed for j1826@xmath01831 and j1915@xmath06548 are lower than what was previously expected for csos , @xmath1180@xmath210  rad  m@xmath3 and 1540@xmath27  rad  m@xmath3 , compared to predicted values of several thousand  rad  m@xmath3 .",
    "these imply low external magnetic field strengths , 0.03 to 6  @xmath4 g , depending on what estimates for electron density and path length are used .",
    "however , only about 500  rad  m@xmath3  mas@xmath11 is needed for beam depolarization to be a major factor for most unpolarized csos .",
    "since these polarized sources have significantly more asymmetric hotspot brightnesses than their unpolarized counterparts , with ratios of @xmath80.1 as opposed to @xmath570.3 , it is plausible that doppler boosting is in effect for the brighter hotspots . then , their jet axis orientations are closer to the line of sight than for other csos such that the polarized hotspot is free of obscuration from the circumnuclear torus .",
    "we put contraints on @xmath29 and @xmath30 for all three sources ( figure  9 ) such that for j0000@xmath04054 and j1826@xmath01831 , @xmath71 0.3 .",
    "more information , specifically the redshift , must be known in order to make tighter constraints . for j1915@xmath06548 , @xmath75 0.5 and @xmath76 50 .",
    "we extended the time baseline for proper motions of the two objects from the coins sample from five to seven years .",
    "this provided a better age estimate for j1826@xmath01831 of 2600@xmath2490  yrs and a better lower limit for the age of j0000@xmath04054 at 610  yrs . extending the time baseline for the proper motions of a larger sample of csos will reduce some of the uncertainties and lower limits of their ages",
    "so that the distribution of ages in the sample can be better determined .",
    "j1915@xmath06548 was determined to be a cso candidate because of the presence of symmetric , steep spectrum hotspots and the lack of a compact , flat or inverted spectrum core .",
    "if confirmed , this will be the third cso with significant polarization .",
    "although spectral age arguments and proper motions from an eleven year time baseline suggest an age between approximately 600 and 1000  yrs , the hotspot separation speed is most certainly relativistic and doppler boosting is occuring in the brighter hotspot .",
    "our age estimates may be underestimating the true source age if the brightest hotspot is undergoing renewed activity from a slowly moving jet or if it is encountering a particularly dense medium , reaccelerating the electrons and giving a lower synchrotron age . if it were the case that the hotspots are transient features and therefore appear younger and faster moving than the radio lobe , then the kinematic ages of many csos would be underestimated .",
    "however , with such small sources , it is possible that a true classical radio lobe has not yet been created and the hotspots are the only indicator of the current phase of activity in csos .",
