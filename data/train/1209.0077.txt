    "the matter formed in high - energy heavy - ion collisions is an opaque qcd medium  @xcite , in which relativistic partons seem to suffer from a substantial medium - induced energy loss .",
    "based on perturbative qcd calculations , this loss is commonly understood as dominated by the radiation of gluons off the energetic parton , cf .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews .",
    "the properties of a medium can , however , significantly influence the probability for the formation of radiation and , in consequence , the amount of radiative energy loss  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "the impact of absorption and polarization effects in an infinite dispersive medium on the energy lost by a relativistic point - charge per unit length ( or time ) was investigated in linear response theory .",
    "these considerations are strictly valid only for electric charges in electro - magnetic plasmas , but can be understood as an abelian approximation for the dynamics of a colour charge in a strongly interacting medium .",
    "the aim of the present work is to provide some more explanatory details for the results derived in  @xcite .",
    "thereby , we follow closely the reasoning of landau and pomeranchuk in their pioneering work  @xcite , in particular , when including the effect of multiple scatterings the charge encounters during the radiation formation process . throughout this work ,",
    "natural units are used , i.e.  @xmath0 .",
    "in line with the study in  @xcite , we determine the energy lost by a charge traversing an absorptive and polarizable medium from the negative of the work that has to be performed for moving against the electric field the charge induces in the medium . the work @xmath1 is conveniently evaluated in the mixed spatial coordinate @xmath2 and frequency @xmath3 representation via @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the fourier - transform of the real and time - dependent classical current @xmath6 for a point - charge @xmath7 produced in the remote past and moving with velocity @xmath8 , while @xmath9 is the corresponding total electric field inside the medium as determined from maxwell s equations for linear dispersive media .",
    "considering in the following an isotropic and homogeneous medium , cf .",
    "@xcite , the constitutive expression for the electric field induced by the above current reads in fourier - space @xmath10+\\omega\\epsilon(\\omega)\\vec{e}_{\\vec{k}}(\\omega )    = -\\frac{iq}{(2\\pi)^2}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dt ' \\vec{v}(t ' )    e^{i\\omega t ' -i\\vec{k}\\vec{r}(t ' ) } \\,.\\ ] ] for simplicity , the permittivity @xmath11 and permeability @xmath12 of the medium are assumed to exhibit no momentum @xmath13-dependence .",

    "( [ equ : definefield ] ) results in @xmath15 for the total electric field , where @xmath16 denotes the @xmath3-dependent complex medium index of refraction squared .    the negative work in differential form for positive @xmath3 following from eq .",

    "@xcite , @xmath20 the remaining @xmath21-integral is calculated by contour integration , where the contour has to be closed in the upper half complex momentum - plane because @xmath22 is positive semidefinit .",
    "depending , in general , on the sign of the non - vanishing imaginary part of @xmath23 , only one of the two simple poles in @xmath24 will be located within the closed contour .",

    "this leads to our main result for the negative differential work for positive @xmath3 reading  @xcite @xmath26 irrespective of the sign of @xmath27 , the amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ equ : wmech4 ] ) is exponentially damped which implies a potential reduction of the negative differential work as compared to the case with a real valued medium index of refraction . in the limit @xmath28 and @xmath29 ,",
    "( [ equ : wmech4 ] ) renders into the expression for the radiation intensity discussed in  @xcite and , thus , represents a radiative energy loss spectrum . in an absorptive medium , @xmath30 , and in case @xmath31",
    "one can show that , considering for simplicity @xmath32 , eq .",
    "( [ equ : wmech4 ] ) also describes a loss of energy , which is the physical situation assumed in our study .    as @xmath33 under variable interchange between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , only the part of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ equ : wmech4 ] ) which is symmetric in @xmath34 and @xmath35 gives rise to a non - vanishing contribution .",
    "then , the time integrations in eq .",
    "( [ equ : wmech4 ] ) may be rearranged in such a way that , together with an overall factor of @xmath36 , only @xmath37 has to be considered in the @xmath34-integral .",
    "furthermore , in order to stay in line with the original work of landau and pomeranchuk  @xcite , one may neglect those terms in eq .",
    "( [ equ : wmech4 ] ) which are related to derivatives of @xmath38 .",
    "correspondingly , eq .  ( [ equ : wmech4 ] ) reduces to @xmath39    \\left\\{\\vec{v}(t)\\,\\vec{v}(t')-   \\frac{(\\vec{v}(t)\\,\\delta\\vec{r})(\\vec{v}(t')\\,\\delta\\vec{r})}{(\\delta r)^2 }    \\right\\ }   \\frac{e^{i\\,sgn(n_i ) \\omega n_r(\\omega ) \\delta r - \\omega |n_i(\\omega)| \\delta r}}{\\delta r }   \\bigg ) \\,.\\ ] ]    such an approximation might at first appear reasonable for large @xmath40 .",
    "it is worthwhile noting , however , that taking into account the terms that are omitted by such a procedure is , in principle , of equivalent importance .",
    "this can easily be seen , for instance , by realizing that in  @xcite the correct limiting bethe - heitler radiation spectrum can only be obtained if one assumes a mean squared transverse momentum transfer that is twice as large as the one for a single rutherford - scattering .",
    "this implies , as was already discussed in  @xcite , that the terms omitted in  @xcite give exactly the same contribution as those that were taken into account in  @xcite .",

    "this results in @xmath43 , such that the differential work in eq .",
    "( [ equ : wmech5 ] ) exactly vanishes . for a time - dependent @xmath8 ,",
    "one may rewrite the time - integrals appearing in eq .",

    "( [ equ : jint1 ] ) , one may assume that any given initial velocity @xmath48 is changed by multiple scatterings in the medium according to @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath50 is a unit vector perpendicular to @xmath48 and @xmath51 is the angle relative to @xmath48 that the charge accumulates through these scatterings within the time - interval between @xmath35 and @xmath52 . for this specific form of @xmath8 ,",
    "one finds @xmath53 in the approximation of small deflection angles within the time - duration @xmath54 after @xmath35 .",
    "likewise , one finds @xmath55 for small deflection angles , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .    assuming random kicks from the medium constituents , stochastic averaging over the deflection angles yields , for instance , @xmath58 , where the quantity @xmath59 is defined here as @xmath60 , i.e.  one half of the mean of the transverse momentum transfer squared per unit time",
    "was incorrectly identified with the mean of the transverse momentum transfer squared per unit time . with the common definition of @xmath61 , the expression for @xmath62 found in  @xcite for the specific charge trajectory considered here and in  @xcite",
    "is modified to some extent , see  @xcite . ] , and @xmath63 is the energy of the charge . as a consequence , one obtains @xmath64 . omitting terms of order @xmath65 and approximating the exact average of @xmath47 by taking the mean of each individual term entering eq .",
    "( [ equ : jint1 ] ) , we find @xmath66    e^{i\\,sgn(n_i ) \\omega n(\\omega ) \\langle\\delta r\\rangle } \\,,\\ ] ] where here @xmath67 .",
    "inserting @xmath68 from eq .",
    "( [ equ : jint2 ] ) into eq .  ( [ equ : wmech5 ] ) finally results in the energy loss spectrum per time - interval presented in  @xcite .",
    "we note that the expression obtained in eq .",
    "( [ equ : jint2 ] ) is a direct consequence of both the particular form of @xmath8 and the assumption of small deflection angles .",
    "the latter gives rise to the condition @xmath69 which implies that , for a given @xmath63 , @xmath54 in the integral in eq .",
    "( [ equ : jint1 ] ) may not be considered too large or , otherwise , @xmath70 becomes unphysical .",
    "this condition is , however , naturally satisfied as the relevant contributions to the @xmath54-integral in eq .",
    "( [ equ : jint1 ] ) stem from the region , in which the oscillating functions vary only slowly , i.e.  for @xmath54 smaller than or of the order of the formation time , cf .  @xcite .",
    "absorption and polarization effects in the dispersive medium can effectively be taken into account via a complex index of refraction  @xcite .",
    "assuming that the radiated quanta obey a dispersion relation that is influenced by the medium , a suitable ansatz for a momentum - independent @xmath71 is @xmath72 in this way , one attributes both an effective mass @xmath73  @xcite and , as result of damping mechanisms , a finite width @xmath74 to the quanta .",
    "in general , @xmath73 and @xmath74 can be free parameters of a lorentz - type spectral function for these excitations  @xcite .    a consequence of the special ansatz eq .",
    "( [ equ : index ] ) is that radiation can not be emitted for @xmath75 .",
    "this follows directly from the dispersion relation as determined by @xmath76 .",
    "in addition , the latter implies also that the emitted quanta are time - like excitations with @xmath3 , for which @xmath27 does not vanish . in  @xcite , in contrast",
    ", the dielectric functions for a strongly interacting medium were determined from the leading - order hard - thermal - loop gluon self - energy . in this case ,",
    "emitted gluons are also time - like quanta with @xmath3 , however , for which @xmath28 .",
    "in this work , we presented a more detailed derivation of the results obained in  @xcite for the energy loss spectrum per time - interval of a relativistic charge traversing an infinite dispersive medium .",
    "absorption mechanisms were found to result in an exponential damping of the spectrum amplitude .",
    "our classical study , which takes as in  @xcite multiple scatterings of the charge in the medium into account , is restricted to the regime of small @xmath77 and is strictly valid only for describing electro - magnetic phenomena .",
    "missing the important non - abelian effect of gluon rescatterings , our approach may , nevertheless , be viewed as an abelian approximation for the dynamics of colour charges in the absorptive quark - gluon plasma .",
    "our main result for the negative differential work given in eq .  ( [ equ : wmech4 ] ) was obtained by assuming that the charge was created in the remote past and that the complex index of refraction was @xmath13-independent .",
    "such simplifications are , however , unrealistic for the situation encountered in high - energy heavy - ion collisions . in particular , the interference between the medium induced radiation and the initial bremsstrahlung due to the production process of the charge within the medium may be of importance .",
    "consequently , the considerations presented here will necessarily have to be improved before firm quantitative conclusions can be drawn .",
    "we leave these issues to be addressed in a forthcoming publication .",
