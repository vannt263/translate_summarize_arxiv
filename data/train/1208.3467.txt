    "blazars are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) whose relativistic jets are seen at a small angle from our line of sight , smaller than @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the bulk lorentz factor of the emitting plasma .",
    "the radiation emitted by their jets is therefore strongly boosted , making them visible at high redshifts .",
    "the most distant blazar known is q0906 + 6930 ( romani et al .",
    "2004 ; romani 2006 ) with a redshift @xmath6 .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of this source reveals both the thermal ( i.e. strong optical emission lines and continuum ) and boosted non  thermal ( dominating in all bands but the near ir and optical ) components .",
    "this is a common characteristic of powerful blazars at high redshift : the non thermal emission is characterized by two broad humps , peaking at lower frequencies as the bolometric luminosity increases , making the underlying thermal emission visible in powerful blazars ( since it stands between the two non  thermal humps ; ghisellini et al . 2010a ; 2010b ) .",
    "the high energy hump , in these sources , peaks below 100 mev , disfavoring its detection by the large area telescope ( lat ) instrument onboard the _ fermi _ satellite ( atwood et al .",
    "instruments observing in the hard x  ray band can instead have more chances to detect them , and in fact the burst alert telescope ( bat ) onboard the _ swift _ satellite ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) have detected blazars up to larger redshifts than lat ( compare ajello et al .",
    "2009 and ackermann et al .",
    "their x  ray spectrum is hard [ i.e. @xmath7 , assuming @xmath8 , and this , together with a relatively strong x  ray to optical flux ratio , can be taken as a signature of the blazar nature of the source .    in this letter",
    "we suggest that sdss j102623.61 + 254259.5 , a radio  loud agn at @xmath9 , is a blazar , i.e. the viewing angle is smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "if so , then this source indicates the presence , at approximately the same redshift , of @xmath10 other sources pointing in other directions , having similar intrinsic physical properties , including the black hole mass .",
    "note that the flatness of the radio spectrum is not sufficient to guarantee the blazar nature of sdss j102623.61 + 254259.5 , since slightly misaligned sources ( with respect to @xmath4 ) still show a flat radio spectrum , especially at relatively large radio frequencies ( at @xmath9 , the observed 1.4 ghz flux corresponds to a rest frame frequency of @xmath119 ghz ) , where the radio lobe steep radio emission does not contribute .",
    "evidences for its blazar nature are its very large radio  loudness and very large radio luminosity .",

    ", we obtained a sample of 31 sources with @xmath14 including 3 with @xmath17 .",
    "the latter sources have no rest frame 2500   flux and hence we calculated @xmath18 extrapolating from the continuum at @xmath19 .",
    "sdss j102623.61 + 254259.5 (= b2 1023 + 25 ) is the best blazar candidate from this list , because of its very high redshift and extreme radio  loudness ( @xmath20 ) .",

    "given the low statistics , the fit with a power law model with galactic absorption ( @xmath43  @xmath35 , kalberla et al .",

    "both resulted in no detection with @xmath46 upper limits of the observed magnitudes equal to 21.70 and 20.76 mag , respectively .",
    "we can calculate the disc luminosity @xmath49 in two ways .",
    "the first is by assuming that the ir  optical flux is produced by a standard , shakura & sunjaev ( 1973 ) accretion disc , and finding the best @xmath49 that accounts for the data . in this respect , for b2 1023 + 25 we have a rather good set of ir  optical data showing that the peak of the disc emission is at frequencies just below the absorption caused by intervening clouds ( see fig .",
    "[ mass ] ) .",
    "since the overall @xmath49 is about twice the @xmath50 peak luminosity , we directly derive @xmath51 .",
    "the second method is through the broad emission lines , assuming they re  emit a fraction @xmath52 ( i.e. their covering factor ) of the ionizing luminosity , and assuming that the latter is provided by the accretion disc .",
    "the average value of @xmath52 is around 0.1 ( baldwin & netzer , 1978 ; smith et al . , 1981 ) , with a rather large dispersion .",
    "b2 1023 + 25 shows a prominent broad ly@xmath53 , that unfortunately is absorbed in its blue wing . using only the red wing , and subtracting the continuum in the same frequency range ( adopting a power law model )",
    ", we derive @xmath54 and a fwhm=4000 km s@xmath2 .",
    "these are twice the values we measured for the red wing only , implicitly assuming that the line is intrinsically symmetric .",
    "the ratio between the entire blr luminosity and @xmath55 has been calculated by francis et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and vanden berk et al .",
    "the former gives a @xmath56 , while the latter gives a @xmath57 .",
    "therefore @xmath58(510)@xmath59 erg s@xmath2 . finally , assuming @xmath60 ,",
    "the estimate for the disc luminosity is @xmath61(510)@xmath62 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "although this estimate is affected by relevant uncertainties ( e.g. partially absorbed ly@xmath53 line and uncertain value of @xmath52 ) , the estimated range encompasses the value found with the first method .",
    "the flux and spectrum of the disc depend on the central black hole mass @xmath63 and on the accretion rate @xmath64 .",
    "the latter is traced by the total disc luminosity @xmath65 , with the efficiency parameter @xmath66 assumed to be @xmath67 .",
    "if we measure @xmath49 ( hence @xmath68 ) , we are left with @xmath63 as the only remaining free parameter . for a given @xmath68 ,",
    "the black hole mass determines the peak frequency of the disc emission .",
    "a larger mass implies a larger disc surface and hence a lower temperature emitting a given luminosity .",
    "therefore , for a fixed @xmath49 , a larger @xmath63 shifts the peak to lower frequencies . then the best agreement with the data fixes @xmath63 .",

    "fig . [ sed ] shows the overall sed of b2 1023 + 25 , together with a fitting model .",
    "the latter is described in ghisellini & tavecchio ( 2009 ) , and consists of one emitting zone , in which relativistic electrons , whose energy distribution is derived through a continuity equation , emit by the synchrotron and inverse compton processes .",
    "the accretion disk component is accounted for , as well the infrared emission reprocessed by a dusty torus and the x  ray emission produced by a hot thermal corona sandwiching the accretion disc .",
    "the parameters adopted to fit the sed are very similar to other powerful blazars studied and interpreted with the same model ( ghisellini et al . , 2010a ; 2010b ) .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor is @xmath73 , the size of the emitting region is @xmath74 cm , located at a distance of @xmath75 cm from a black hole of @xmath76 .",
    "the magnetic field is @xmath77 g. the main emission process for the x  ray and @xmath78ray non  thermal continuum is the inverse compton process off the emission line photons ( i.e. external compton ) .",
    "since the emitting region is rather compact , its radio emission is self  absorbed ( up to@xmath11600 ghz ) and can not account for the observed radio flux , that must necessarily come from much larger zones .",
    "the poynting flux carried by the jet is @xmath79 erg s@xmath2 , and the power spent to produce the radiation we see is @xmath80 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the power in the bulk motion of the emitting relativistic electrons is @xmath81 erg s@xmath2 , while the power in cold protons ( assuming one proton per relativistic electron ) is @xmath82 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "[ comparison ] shows how the sed of b2 1023 + 25 compares with the sed of q0906 + 693 . as can be seen , the two seds are very similar .",
    "the only , remarkable , difference could be in the @xmath78ray band , if the tentative egret association with q0906 + 6930 is real . on the other hand , the upper limits of _",
    "fermi_/lat are the same for the two sources .",
    "this may suggest that the egret flux is not produced by q0906 + 6930 , although variations of even more than two orders of magnitude of the @xmath78ray flux are not uncommon for blazars ( see e.g. abdo et al .",

    "2011 ) .",

    "( harrison et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "we report also the pre ",
    "launch estimated _ nustar _",
    "sensitivity for an exposure of 1 ms .",
    "it is remarkable that both sources have an x  ray flux lying one order of magnitude above the _ nustar _ sensitivity , making their detection possible even with a moderate exposure time , and even at the high energy limit of the instrument , i.e. at @xmath1180 kev .",
    "note that 80 kev correspond , in the rest frame of a @xmath9 source , to @xmath11500 kev , that could be rather close to the peak of the high energy emission .",
    "in this letter we propose that the radio  loud , high redshift quasar b2 1023 + 25 is a blazar .",
    "it is the second most distant blazar known up to now , with redshift @xmath9 , that corresponds to an age of the universe of @xmath83yrs .",
    "both its thermal and non  thermal components are very luminous . in agreement with the blazar sequence ( fossati et al .",
    "1998 ) the two broad non  thermal humps peak at small frequency .",
    "in particular , the hard x  ray spectrum and the upper limit in the @xmath78ray band constrain the high energy component to peak in the mev region of the spectrum . therefore",
    "this source , along with the similar other powerful blazars , should have a relatively large hard x  ray flux and would have been an ideal target for planned hard x  ray instruments , such as _ exist _ , _ symbol  x _ and _ nhxm _ , and it is a good target to be observed with the only orbiting satellite with focussing hard x  ray telescopes , i.e. _ nustar _ ( harrison et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "the great sensitivity over its energy range [ 580 kev ] enables it to detect the hard x  ray spectrum of this source , even if it can not directly observe the peak of the high energy hump .",
    "thanks to the good data coverage in the ir  optical range , given by the combination of the 7 simultaneous optical  near ir filters of grond coupled with wise and sdss data , we were able to estimate the central black hole mass , that turned out to be between 2 and 5 billion solar masses .",
    "this relatively small range compares well with the virial estimates in general ( that have at least a factor @xmath114 of uncertainties , see e.g. vestergaard & peterson 2006 ) , and , in particular , it is the only method applicable for this source , where only a partially absorbed ly@xmath53 line is visible ( and virial methods are not yet well calibrated in this case ) . near ",
    "ir spectroscopy , and hence the detection of the broad civ and mgii lines , would help to improve the virial estimate of the black hole mass and be a valuable cross  check of our estimate , based on the disk  continuum .",
    "it is remarkable to find radio  loud agn hosting bh that massive at an age of the universe of only @xmath83yrs .",
    "the discovery that b2 1023 + 25 is a blazar , together with that one of q0906 + 693 , in fact , implies the existence of an entire family of radio  loud , very massive quasars in the early universe , whose jet is not aligned with our line  of  sight .",
    "moreover , it is possible to roughly estimate the number of these objects and their spatial density .",
    "the comoving density of heavy black holes at high redshifts of radio  loud sources has been studied by volonteri et al .",

    "( 2010a ) . in the latter paper",
    "the observational constrain on the blazar density with black holes heavier than @xmath85 in the redshift bin @xmath86 was based on the detection of only one object : q0906 + 6930 . assuming it was the only blazar in the entire sky in this redshift bin , ghisellini et al .",

    "its existence in this portion of the sky implies that the space density of blazars hosting a @xmath89 black hole is a factor @xmath90 greater than estimated previously ( increasing the corresponding comoving density to @xmath91 gpc@xmath88 ) . in turn",
