    "throughout human history infectious diseases have been a constant threat to the health of society , and when diseases become epidemic they cause huge economic losses . models that enable the prediction and control of epidemics have attracted much attention among researchers in the fields of epidemiology , biology , sociology , mathematics , and physics .",
    "bernoulli proposed the first mathematical model for understanding the spreading of smallpox @xcite .",
    "it initiated a new era in the modern mathematical modeling of infectious diseases , and many models for describing the characteristics of epidemic spreading in which the states of individuals are disaggregated by compartments have been proposed .",
    "for example , the acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( aids ) can be described using the susceptible - infected ( si ) model , since infected individuals , once infected by the aids virus , can not be cured .",
    "seasonal influenza and blennorrhagia can be described using the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model , because individuals can be infected more than once .",
    "chickenpox and measles can be modeled using the susceptible - infected - resistant ( sir ) model , because once infected individuals have recovered they acquire permanent immunization @xcite .    during the last century",
    "many researchers assumed that all individuals uniformly interact , i.e. , that they interact with all other individuals with the same probability @xcite .",
    "thus the internal structure or topology of the contact network through which the epidemic spreads was neglected .",
    "the main features of the topology of a contact network include its degree distribution @xmath0 , i.e. , the fraction of nodes with @xmath1 contacts , the weights on links and nodes , degree correlations , clustering , and community structure @xcite . with the availability of large - scale data in real - world contact networks ,",
    "scholars have become aware of the existence of heterogeneities in the topology of networks ( i.e. , power - law degree distribution and different weights of contact network ) , the high clustering , and small - world phenomena @xcite .",
    "the effects of contact network topology on epidemic spreading was first introduced by pastor - satorras and vespignani @xcite using complex networks in which the nodes represent individuals and the edges the interactions among them .    over the past decade",
    "this pioneering work has encouraged much outstanding research in the field of network spreading dynamics @xcite .",
    "both monte carlo simulations @xcite and theoretical study @xcite have investigated the effects of network structures on epidemic spreading velocity @xcite , epidemic variability @xcite , epidemic size @xcite , and epidemic thresholds @xcite .",
    "both the epidemic size and threshold can indicate the probability of an epidemic occurring @xcite , which seeds are influential @xcite , and how to effectively control the epidemic once it begins @xcite . when the transmission probability is above an epidemic threshold the system is in an active epidemic state , i.e. , there is a finite fraction of nodes infected by the epidemic , but when the transmission probability is below the epidemic threshold the epidemic dissipates .",
    "near the epidemic threshold the system exhibits such interesting phenomena as the rare - region phenomenon @xcite and the scaling behavior of the main magnitudes @xcite . generally speaking",
    ", previous research has addressed how the topology of the contact networks has an affect on the macrocosmic , mesoscale , and microscopic levels .",
    "research on the macroscopic scale , which focuses primarily on the effects of degree and weight distributions @xcite , has revealed that networks with strong heterogeneous degree distributions have a vanishing epidemic threshold @xcite and that the heterogeneous weight distributions increase the epidemic threshold @xcite .",
    "research on the mesoscopic scale , which focuses on degree - degree correlations , clustering , and communities @xcite , has found that assortativity @xcite , high clustering @xcite , and community structure @xcite enhance the epidemic outbreak and that disassortativity @xcite diminishes it .",
    "research on epidemics from a microscopic point of view @xcite has discovered that high - degree nodes  hubs  are infected quickly @xcite and that the epidemic is more likely to transmit through low - weight edges @xcite .",
    "there are many successful theoretical approaches to describing epidemic spreading on complex networks . when describing the interplay between complex network structure and the dynamics of epidemic spreading ,",
    "there are two challenges .",
    "the first is describing the intricate topologies of the contact networks , since in real - world networks this involves heterogeneous degree and weight distributions @xcite , high clustering @xcite , motif structure @xcite , community structure @xcite , and fractal structures @xcite .",
    "the second and more difficult challenge is describing the strong dynamic correlations among the states of the nodes .",
    "the dynamic correlations are produced when the epidemic being transmitted to a node from two of its neighbors are correlated @xcite .",
    "when there is only one seed node and there is high clustering the dynamic correlations are obvious , since all the infection paths come from the same seed .",
    "these two challenges are not fully addressed in the existing literature , which always assumes ( i ) that an epidemic spreads on a large , sparse network @xcite , ( ii ) that dynamic correlations among the neighbors do not exist @xcite , and ( iii ) that all the nodes or edges within a given class are statistically equivalent @xcite .",
    "these theoretical approaches can be changed by removing or adding assumptions , but a comprehensive review of the relationships among these approaches is still lacking . here",
    "we discuss the main contributions , basic assumptions , and derivation processes of seven widely - used approaches in terms of their increasing complexity .",
    "the two most widely used model for epidemic spreading dynamics are the reversible susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) and the irreversible susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) models @xcite . in the sis model",
    "the nodes are either susceptible or infected . in its continuous time version , at each time step each infected node transmits its infection to all its susceptible neighbors at the same rate @xmath2 and returns to the susceptible state at a rate @xmath3 .",
    "thus the effective transmission rate , i.e. , the effective transmission of infection , is @xmath4 . without loss of generality we set @xmath5 . in the sir model , unlike the sis model , an infected node recovers and is permanently removed at the rate @xmath3 .",
    "figures  [ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) show schematically the transitions between compartments in the sis and sir models .",
    "the schematic temporal evolutions of the sis and sir models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) . when @xmath6 , the order parameters ( i.e. , the epidemic sizes ) of the two models overcome a second - order phase transition depending on the value of @xmath7 , as shown in fig .  [ fig1](d ) .",
    "the critical threshold @xmath8 divides the phase diagram into absorbing and active regions . when @xmath9 there is an absorbing region and no epidemic .",
    "when @xmath10 there is an active region and a global epidemic develops .",
    "the theoretical approaches that enable the computation of the epidemic threshold and the magnitude of these models , i.e. , the epidemic size , exhibit similar but distinct frameworks for the sis and sir models and are of two types . in the first type",
    "the only difference between the sis and the sir models is that in the sir a removed state is added to the sis model .",
    "this first type includes the mean - field , heterogeneous mean - field , dynamic message - passing , and pairwise approximation approaches .",
    "the second type includes the link percolation and edge - based compartmental approaches , which provide the valid and obvious framework for the sir model since , unlike the sis model , it is irreversible . here",
    "we use the sis model to illustrate the relations among the existing approaches of this first type .",
    "we use the sir model to explain the approaches of the second type . to clarify the following ,",
    "the definitions of the parameters are given in table  [ table1 ] in the appendix .",
    "* mean - field ( mf ) approach . *",
    "the simplest framework for describing these models  the mean - field ( mf ) approach  assumes that the population is fully mixed , i.e. , that all nodes in the population are statistically equivalent and thus the interaction probabilities between any two individuals are the same . as a consequence the topology of the contact network",
    "is neglected .",
    "this approach was widely used in the last century @xcite .",

    "when @xmath24 there is an active region and a global epidemic develops .",
    "the simplest mf approach neglects the internal structure of the contact networks and the dynamic correlations among the states of the neighbors .",
    "this oversimplified approach produces qualitatively analytical results , such as the existence of an epidemic threshold and the scaling relation of critical phenomena  @xcite . for networks with a homogeneous degree distribution ( e.g. , those with a well - mixed population and those that are random regular networks ) ,",

    "the hmf approach has been highly successful in describing the dynamics of epidemic spreading for two reasons , i.e. , ( i ) we only need to know the degree distribution and ( ii ) hmf is able to uncover how topological heterogeneity affects epidemic spreading , e.g. , there is no epidemic threshold when the degree distributions are highly heterogeneous .",
    "researchers have generalized the hmf approach to investigate the effects of weight distribution @xcite , degree - degree correlations @xcite , and multiplicity @xcite .",
    "for example , wang et al .",
    "@xcite generalized the hmf theory to study the effect of asymmetrically - interacting spreading dynamics on complex layered networks and found that the epidemic outbreak on the contact layer can induce an outbreak of information on the communication layer , and that the information spreading can effectively raise the epidemic threshold .",
    "the hmf approach is usually effective when the networks have an infinite topological dimension , i.e. , when the number of nodes in a neighborhood grows proportionately to network size @xmath50 with the topological distance from an arbitrary origin  @xcite .",
    "although random networks above the percolation threshold indeed have an infinite dimension , some researchers find that the hmf approach can fail because two important factors are not taken into consideration  @xcite .",

    "the most commonly - used approach is link percolation ( lp ) approach , and the most studied version is the time - continuous kermack - mckendrick @xcite formulation in which an infected individual transmits the disease to a susceptible neighbor at a rate @xmath2 and recovers at a rate @xmath3 .",
    "this sir version has been widely studied in the epidemiological literature , but unfortunately it allows some individuals to recover immediately after being infected , which is unrealistic since any real - world disease has a characteristic average recovery time . to overcome this shortcoming",
    ", many studies use the discrete reed - frost model @xcite in which an infected individual transmits the disease to a susceptible neighbor with a probability @xmath2 and recovers @xmath133 steps following the time of infection . in the discrete updating method",
    "the transmissibility @xmath7 is the probability that an individual will infect one susceptible neighbor before recovery , and it is given by @xmath134 note that in the continuous time updating approach @xmath135 is used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the order parameter @xmath136 , which is the final fraction of recovered nodes , overcomes a second - order phase transition at the epidemic threshold @xmath137 , which is determined by the network structure .",
    "note that the reed - frost model can be mapped into a link percolation process @xcite .",
    "heuristically , the relation between sir and link percolation is sustained because the probability @xmath7 that a link is traversed by the disease is equivalent to the occupancy probability @xmath138 in link percolation .",
    "thus both processes have the same threshold and belong to the same universality class . in addition",
    ", each realization of the sir model corresponds to a single cluster of link percolation .",
    "this feature is relevant when mapping between the order parameters @xmath139 of link percolation and @xmath140 for epidemics , as we will explain below . in a sir realization ,",
    "only one infected cluster emerges for any value of @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast , in a percolation process when @xmath141 many clusters with a cluster size distribution are generated @xcite . thus we need criteria to distinguish between epidemics ( the giant connected cluster in percolation ) and outbreaks ( finite clusters ) .",
    "the cluster size distribution over many realizations of the sir process , close to but above criticality , has a gap between small clusters ( no epidemics ) and large clusters ( epidemics ) .",
    "thus when defining a cutoff @xmath142 of the cluster size as the minimum value before the gap interval , the cluster sizes below @xmath142 are not considered epidemics but those above @xmath142 are ( see fig .",
    "[ sc11]a ) .",
    "note that @xmath143 depends on @xmath50 .",
    "then averaging those sir realizations larger than the cutoff @xmath142 we find that the fraction of recovered individuals @xmath140 maps exactly with @xmath144 ( see fig .  [ sc11]b ) . in our simulations , we use @xmath145 for @xmath146 .",
    "when we use a cutoff close to criticality , all the exponents that characterize the transition are the same for link percolation and epidemic spreading @xcite . above but close to @xmath147 we have @xmath148 with @xcite @xmath149 the exponent @xmath150 of the finite cluster size distribution in percolation close to criticality is given by @xmath151    near criticality the probability of a cluster of size @xmath152 , @xmath153 , has an exponent @xmath154 in which @xmath150 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq.tau ] ) ( see fig .",
    "[ sc11]a ) . for sf networks with @xmath155 in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the threshold is zero and there is no percolation phase transition .",
    "in addition , all the exponents take mean - field values when @xmath156 for sf networks and er networks .    in an uncorrelated network with a degree distribution @xmath0 ,",
    "the probability of reaching a node with a degree @xmath1 by following a randomly chosen link on the graph is @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is the average degree .",
    "this is because the probability of reaching a given node by following a randomly chosen link is proportional to the number of links @xmath1 connected to that node , and @xmath159 is needed for normalization .",
    "note that when we arrive to a node with a degree @xmath1 by following a random chosen link , the total number of outgoing links or branches of that node is @xmath160 .",
    "thus the probability of arriving at a node with @xmath160 outgoing branches by following a randomly chosen link is also @xmath161 .",
    "this value is the excess degree probability @xcite .    to obtain the threshold of link percolation",
    ", we consider a randomly - chosen occupied link . to compute the probability",
    "that through this link an infinite cluster will not be reached we assume , for simplicity , that we have a cayley tree with a given degree distribution .",
    "note that link percolation can be thought of as many realizations of a cayley tree with an occupancy probability @xmath138 that gives rise to many clusters .",
    "the probability that when starting from an occupied link we will not reach shell @xmath162 through a path of occupied links is given by @xmath163^{k-1},\\\\ & = & g_{1}[(1-p)+pq_{n-1}(p)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath164 is the generating function of the excess degree distribution .",

    "thus the lp approach can predict the final epidemic size and threshold on networks with an infinite uncorrelated local tree - like configuration  @xcite .",
    "note that sir spreading is a dynamical infection process with an intricate interplay between complex network structure and dynamical correlations , and this differs from the static link percolation model .",
    "thus the network topology , the time evolutions , and the dynamical correlations among the states of neighbors can not be described using the classical lp approach , especially near the critical point  @xcite . for epidemic spreading on finite size networks or when",
