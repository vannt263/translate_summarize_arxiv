    "two kinds of instabilities , buckling and barrelling , may occur when a two - dimensional nonlinearly elastic rectangle being compressed uniaxially .",
    "the instability of the uniaxial compression of a rod is an old problem which was firstly studied by euler who gave the euler s buckling formula to predict the onset of buckling of a rod .",
    "however bernoulli - euler beam theory does not take into account the effect of transverse shear strain , and the euler s buckling formula is not valid for relative thick rods .",
    "recently , a more sophisticated beam theory is derived by russell and white @xcite by assuming that the axial displacement is of the second order of the transverse displacement .",
    "the existence of solutions is established and the post - buckling solution is computed numerically . in this paper",
    "we consider both buckling and barrelling instabilities and present some new analytical post - buckling and post - barrelling results for both thin and moderately thick two - dimensional rectangle under clamped boundary conditions .",
    "theoretical analysis of this type of compression problems has been carried out by many authors under lubricated boundary conditions , such as @xcite and those listed in their references . in @xcite ,",
    "simpson and spector study barrelling instability of compression of a solid circular cylinder . in @xcite",
    "they obtain the condition of critical compression ratios at which the cylinder will barrel . in @xcite , for a specific material a detailed relationship between critical compression ratio and modes @xmath0 are investigated . in @xcite ,",
    "both barrelling and buckling instabilities of compression of a two - dimensional elastic rectangle are studied by davies .",
    "it is found that the rectangle will buckle or barrel under some compression ratios .",
    "buckling and barrelling behavior depends on the sign of a parameter which is related to the strain energy function and compression ratio . when this parameter is nonnegative",
    ", buckling will occur first .",
    "a set of sufficient conditions that barrelling occurs first is given as a theorem .",
    "in @xcite , davies studies buckling of a square column and barrelling of a circular cylinder .",
    "the largest critical compression ratio @xmath1 that a square column begins to buckle is compared with the largest critical compression ratio @xmath2 that a cylinder begins to barrel .",
    "and then some conditions of which instability occurs first are analyzed .    in the above theoretical analysis ,",
    "lubricated boundary conditions at two ends are used and this condition is also used in many other literatures such as two recent papers @xcite concerning buckling and barrelling . in @xcite ,",
    "goriely et .",
    "study the compression of a three - dimensional incompressible cylindrical tube under axial load .",
    "they derive a new and compact formulation of the bifurcation criterion for both barrelling modes and buckling modes .",
    "also , a nonlinear correction is made for the euler s buckling formula .",
    "the asymptotic expression of the critical aspect ratio separating instability by barrelling from buckling is obtained .",
    "simpson and spector in @xcite prove a rectangular elastic rod will buckle under quasistatic compression at two frictionless ends .",
    "this is very valuable since seldom results can prove  a second bifurcation of solutions actually bifurcates from a known solution branch when the known branch becomes unstable\"(see @xcite , p. 1 ) .",
    "another proof of the existence of nontrivial bifurcated branch in finite elasticity is given by healey and montes - pizarro @xcite and lubricated boundary conditions are also used .",
    "however , in practice and experiments , it is very difficult to realize such lubricated boundary conditions , especially when the external force becomes large .",
    "not so many experimental works on both buckling and barrelling have been carried out .",
    "two well known experiments are done by beatty and hook @xcite and beatty and dadras @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "circular rubber bars with different aspect ratios @xmath3 ( ratio of diameter with length for cylinders ) are compressed at two lubricated ends .",
    "it is found that when @xmath4 , only buckling can occur .",
    "while , when @xmath5 , only barrelling can occur . there is a  transition region in which the nature of the strut behavior becomes increasingly ambiguous\"(see @xcite , p. 630 ) .",
    "they believe that there should be a limiting aspect ratio value in this transition region which separates instability by barrelling from buckling and this value is estimated by @xmath6 graphically . in another experiment of @xcite ,",
    "three different elastomers including circular cylindrical bars , rectangular bars and thick - walled tubular columns are also compressed at two lubricated ends . in each case a similar  transition region \"",
    "is found and similar results are concluded . in these two experiments ,",
    "their experimental results have good qualitative agreement with the theoretical analysis of beatty @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that there exist frictions at two flat ends although they are lubricated in experiments .",
    "it is also remarked by beatty and hook in@xcite that  in spite of lubrication , the material consistently tended to adhere to the end plates of the test machine\"(@xcite , p. 628 ) and  we are unable to assess in any case the extent to which end effects may have influenced our measurements\"(@xcite , p. 630 ) .",
    "so far there is rare literature from either experimental results or theoretical analytical analysis about compressions of bars when friction is taken into account .",
    "also the effect of frictions on instabilities of bars is not known .    in this paper , due to mathematical difficulties in description of frictions ,",
    "one of our motivations is to analysize the effect of clamped boundary conditions in instabilities .",
    "a key feature shared by a clamped constraint and friction is that they both limit the lateral movement of the end cross section .",
    "we aim to reveal , under such a constraint , that there indeed exists a transition region as observed in experiments . as far as we know",
    ", it seems that no other work has considered such two or three dimensional clamped boundary conditions in stability and instability analysis .",
    "the clamped boundary condition used by others before is mainly a one - dimensional condition which only includes zero lateral displacement and zero slope at ends . here by using combined series - asymptotic expansions , we can obtain asymptotically approximate boundary conditions for clamped ends .",
    "another motivation is related to the euler s buckling formula which gives critical compressive force when a rod begins to buckle under compression .",
    "this formula is based on the bernoulli - euler constitutive equation . here",
    "we derive a new model equation for the critical stress values where the axial strain is emphasized .",
    "numerical results show that we can give an improvement of the first critical stress value .",
    "the structure of this paper is arranged as follows . in section [ sec : fieldeq ] , we present the field equations and traction free boundary conditions . without loss of generality ,",
    "we study the isotropic compressible hyperelastic murnaghan material . due to the difficulty of nonlinearity",
    ", we assume the aspect ratio is small , i.e. , we are considering a thin or moderately thick rectangle . then in section",
    "[ sec : dimenless ] , after nondimensionalization of the field equations and traction free boundary conditions , we can find two small parameters and one small variable . thus in section [ sec : reduction ] by using the combined series - asymptotic expansions two decoupled nonlinear ode s are obtained .",
    "one governs the leading order of the axial strain which can be written as a singular ode system .",
    "another governs both the axial strain and shear strain .",
    "these two equations can also be obtained by the variational principle , as shown in section [ sec : eulerlagrange ] . in section",
    "[ sec : endcond ] , by using the combined series - asymptotic expansions , the clamped boundary conditions amount to a set of asymptotically approximate boundary conditions , which will be used to determine the axial strain and shear strain . in section",
    "[ sec : solutions ] , we make some bifurcation analysis . by phase plane analysis",
    ", the solution of the axial strain can be obtained under the clamped boundary conditions . an asymptotic solution for the shear strain",
    "can be obtained through the wkb method .",
    "then the condition determining the buckling critical stress value is obtained under the clamped boundary conditions . for chosen material constants ,",
    "numerical calculations show that when the aspect ratio is relatively large ( within our assumption of a small aspect ratio ) , there will be no buckling mode .",
    "but there is a bifurcation to the corner - like profile which is a barrelling instability .",
    "this corner - like profile is related to willis instability which is described by beatty in @xcite . in @xcite , dai and wang have made some analysis and pointed out that this kind of instability could be caused by the coupling effect of material nonlinearity and geometry size of the rectangle . when the aspect ratio is relatively small , only buckling modes can be found and the thinner of the rectangle the more of the buckling modes .",
    "one important difference between our buckling and previous works is that our buckling is not a special kind of buckling while buckling in some of the previous works such as @xcite is a euler - type buckling which is very special .",
    "a major finding based on the analytical results is that under clamped boundary conditions there is indeed a transition region such that when the aspect ratio is larger than a critical value the barrelling instability occurs and when it is smaller than another critical value the buckling instability occurs .",
    "this reveals that existence of a transition region , which is in agreement with the experimental results of beatty and hook @xcite and beatty and dadras @xcite . in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we will make our conclusions .",
    "we study the deformation of a two - dimensional rectangle composed of a compressible hyperelastic material .",
    "let the length of the rectangle be @xmath7 and the thickness be @xmath8 and let @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the cartesian coordinates of a material point in the reference and current configurations respectively .",
    "the axial and lateral displacements are denoted by @xmath11 respectively .",
    "then the deformation gradient tensor @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 represent the orthonormal basis in the reference and current configurations respectively .",
    "here we have chosen @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    without loss of generality , we assume this rectangle is composed of a murnaghan material whose strain energy function has the following form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the green strain tensor , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are known as the lam constants , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are other constitutive constants , @xmath24 is the trace of a tensor .",
    "the first piola - kirchhoff stress tensor * @xmath25 * containing terms up to the third - order material nonlinearity for an arbitrary strain energy function can be calculated by a formula provided in @xcite , which is given below : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are elastic moduli defined by @xmath31 and * i * is the identity tensor corresponding to a natural configuration .    here",
    "we study a static problem , and the field equations ( neglecting the body force ) are given by @xmath32 @xmath33 substituting ( [ stresst ] ) into ( [ gov1 ] ) and ( [ gov2 ] ) , we have @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 only include third - order nonlinear terms . here and hereafter",
    "the lengthy expressions of @xmath38 are omitted and their expressions are given in the appendix .",
    "in addition to the above two governing equations , we assume that there is no lateral distributive loading on the lateral boundaries",
    ". then the stress components @xmath39 and @xmath40 should vanish on the lateral boundaries .",
    "we have the following traction free boundary conditions : @xmath41 @xmath42 we will study the bifurcations of the nonlinear pde s ( [ gov1 - 2 ] ) and ( [ gov2 - 2 ] ) under ( [ bd1 ] ) and ( [ bd2 ] ) and some end conditions .    for the solution obtained if one of its deformation gradients has a finite jump across a curve in the rectangle , this solution should satisfy the jump conditions .",
    "these conditions require the force balance and the continuity of the deformation .",
    "namely , @xmath43 must hold on the curve of discontinuity . @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote its limiting values at a point on the curve of discontinuity and @xmath46 is the unit normal and @xmath47 are all vectors tangent to the curve .",
    "it is difficult to study the nonlinear pde s ( [ gov1 - 2 ] ) and ( [ gov2 - 2 ] ) together with traction free boundary conditions ( [ bd1 ] ) and ( [ bd2 ] ) .",
    "but we can use the combined series - asymptotic expansion method to deal with this complicated system .",
    "this approach adapted here is similar to those used in @xcite .",
    "first we introduce a new set of dimensionless quantities through the following suitable scalings : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the characteristic axial displacement which can be regarded as the reduction of the distance between the ends , @xmath50 will be treated as a small parameter since here the deformation is considered to be small .",
    "we assume the rectangle is thin such that @xmath51 is small , say , @xmath52 ; this implies that @xmath53 , i.e. , the aspect ratio is less than @xmath54 .",
    "for simplicity of notation , we will drop the bar from @xmath55 and @xmath56 hereafter .    after the above proper scalings ,",
    "the original field equations and traction free boundary conditions become : @xmath57 @xmath58    @xmath59    @xmath60    where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are constants related to constitutive constants which are given in the appendix .",
    "it is also hard to analyze the equations ( [ gov1 - 1])([bd2 - 1 ] ) directly . in the next section by using series expansion and asymptotic reduction",
    ", we will obtain much simplified equations .",
    "in section [ sec : dimenless ] , we have obtained nondimensionlized field equations and boundary conditions . since we consider the case that @xmath51 is small and @xmath63",
    ", @xmath64 is a small variable .",
    "we can see that the whole problem depends on two small parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 , one small variable @xmath64 and one variable @xmath65 .",
    "assume that @xmath66 and @xmath67 are sufficiently smooth and then they have the following taylor expansions in the neighborhood of @xmath68 : @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a parameter , which is a measure of deflection of the central axis . since the purpose here is to deduce the critical loads for buckling when",
    "there is a buckling instability and compare the values with those obtained from the bernoulli - euler beam theory , we consider the case that @xmath71 is small such that @xmath72 .    substituting ( [ seru ] ) and ( [ serv ] ) into the boundary conditions ( [ bd1 - 1 ] ) and ( [ bd2 - 1 ] ) , we can get the following four equations : @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 in these equations , if @xmath77 terms are omitted , there are ten unknowns @xmath78 . to have a closed system , we need another six equations .    substituting ( [ seru ] ) and ( [ serv ] ) into the field equation ( [ gov1 - 1 ] )",
    ", the left hand side becomes a series in @xmath64 .",
    "all the coefficients of @xmath79 should be zero and as a result we have a set of infinitely - many equations .",
    "it turns out that the first three equations@xmath80 contain only the above - mentioned 10 unknowns by neglecting proper higher - order terms .",
    "these equation are @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 similarly , substituting ( [ seru ] ) and ( [ serv ] ) into another field equation ( [ gov2 - 1 ] ) and letting the coefficients of @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 be zero , we have @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89    now the field equations ( [ gov1 - 1])([gov2 - 1 ] ) and boundary conditions ( [ bd1 - 1])([bd2 - 1 ] ) are changed into a one - dimensional system of differential equations ( [ bound1])([g3 ] ) for ten unknowns @xmath90 if we neglect @xmath91 in ( [ f1])([g3 ] ) and @xmath92 in ( [ bound1])([bound4 ] ) . by using perturbation method , we can solve @xmath93 from ( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "then substituting it into ( [ g2 ] ) , we can get @xmath94 .",
    "further we substitute @xmath93 and @xmath94 into ( [ f3 ] ) and we can get @xmath95 .",

    "we also notice that both ( [ bound2 - 2 ] ) and ( [ bound4 - 2 ] ) can be integrated once .",
