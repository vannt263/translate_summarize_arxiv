    "photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) is an important tool to understand the electronic structure of strongly correlated quasi two - dimensional systems like high @xmath3 superconductors .",
    "most theoretical work concentrates on two dimensional model systems , and when the theoretical results are compared with pes the three - dimensionality of the actual experimental samples is only schematically , if at all , taken into account .",
    "further almost all discussions are based on the sudden approximation ( sa ) , and do not consider extrinsic losses and interference effects . for recent work on strongly correlated systems beyond sa we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "we define sa as the bulk one - electron spectral function augmented with dipole matrix elements .",
    "this approximation is exact in the high energy limit for isolated systems like atoms and molecules . for solids ,",
    "where the electrons come from a surface region and the mean free path is an important feature , sa is never valid , not even at high energies . here the correct high energy limit is a convolution of the sudden approximation and the loss function ( sa*lf ) .",
    "sa is particularly valuable when we only look for peak positions such as quasi - particle energies ( e g for bandstructure mapping ) .",
    "there are indications that also quasi - particle lineshapes are well represented .",
    "@xcite when it comes to spectral properties over a more extended energy region , which is important for e g strongly correlated systems , sa can no longer be relied on . for core level photoemission from weakly correlated systems like metals and valence semiconductors",
    "sa*lf correctly describes the satellite intensities only in the kev region , while the asymmetric quasi - particle line shape ( in metals ) is given correctly by sa already at low energies @xcite . for _ localized _ strongly correlated systems sa",
    "is reached rather quickly , say at 5 - 10 ev above threshold .",
    "@xcite    we analyze the three dimensional dielectric response of a stack of strongly correlated 2d sheets in the @xmath4 plane , embedded in a 3d background .",
    "we then assume , as expressed in eq .",
    "[ epsbulk ] , that the response to the total electrostatic potential is given by a sum of a 3d part and a 2d part . with the 3d part depending only on the coordinate difference in 3d , and the 2d part on the difference in 2d , the dielectric function is obtained on a closed form .",
    "this closed form allows us to find an approximate relation between the electron energy loss function and the dynamically screened potential @xmath5 .",
    "the relation is only approximate since energy loss is related to the diagonal part ( in @xmath1-space ) of the dielectric function , while we need the non - diagonal @xmath6 ( or equivalently @xmath7 ) for the loss problem in photoemission . in pes we need to know @xmath8 in the presence of a surface , while the loss data are obtained from a bulk sample .",
    "this calls for additional approximations .",
    "our numerical evaluations concern bi2212 and are based on a parametrization of the loss function given by norman et al @xcite .",
    "we however include dispersion in the dielectric function , which makes the mean free path much longer .",
    "we use atomic units with @xmath9 , and thus e g energies are in hartrees ( 27.2 ev ) and lengths in bohr radii ( 0.529 a ) .",
    "for the interpretation of photoemission from the cuprates the value of the mean free path at energies of about 20 ev , where the experiments usually are done , is very important . in a recent paper by norman et al @xcite very short values of the order 2 - 3 a were obtained for bi2212 .",
    "norman et al however neglected the @xmath1 dependence in the loss function . in the electron gas case neglect of dispersion",
    "makes the mean free path about half the value with dispersion .",
    "when we introduce dispersion for bi2212 we find an even larger effect on the mean free path .",
    "norman et al used a parametrization of the energy loss data on @xmath10 ( bi2212 ) obtained by ncker et al @xcite , @xmath11 with parameters ( energies in ev ) given below @xmath12 the first peak at about @xmath13 is associated with 2d plasmon excitations , while the large double peak comes from essentially 3d excitations since it is similar to what is observed in cu metal ( c f ref .",
    "the linear rise for small @xmath14 comes from acoustic plasmons ( due to the coupling of the 2d plasmons in the different layers ) , and also to some extent from electron - hole excitations .",

    "such a replacement makes @xmath48 smaller and our approximation thus again slightly underestimates the mean free path .    in fig .",
    "1 we show results for the inverse mean free paths for the 2d and 3d contributions .",
    "it is remarkable that the 2d effects , while peaked at 1.5 ev , extend quite far , out to some 30 ev .",
    "the 3d contribution starts dominating at about 10 ev .",
    "the mean free path @xmath49 , given by @xmath50 , is shown in fig .",
    "the maximum in @xmath51 is reached at about 100 ev , where the mean free path has its minimum of some 5 a. it seems to be a universal feature that the minimum mean free path is about 5 a at an energy about 3 - 4 times the energy where the loss processes are strongest , as can be seen from tabulations of loss functions @xcite and mean free paths . @xcite  the qualitative behavior of the 2d and 3d contributions in fig .",
    "1 are similar to what has been obtained in rpa calculations for the layered electron gas .",
    "@xcite we remark that norman et al besides the inverse mean free path also calculated the background in pes in the traditional way from the extrinsic losses only , following the common convention to take the background as zero at the bottom of the main band . if we do a similar background calculation the results are very close to the norman et al s since in such a calculation only the shape and not the strength of the loss function enters .",
    "we emphasize that in our treatment of pes later in this paper we include besides the extrinsic losses also the intrinsic ones and the interference terms , which gives a radically different result for small energy losses .",
    "we are interested in photoemission from the @xmath2 layers .",
    "the layers are regarded as localized systems embedded in a 3d environment .",
    "the crystal surface is taken to be parallel with the layers and in the @xmath52 plane .",
    "we take the electrons in the 2d layers as separate from the other electrons , and write the state vectors for the initial and final states as @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the state vector for the electrons in one particular layer at a distance @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) from the surface ( the one from which the photoelectron comes ) , and @xmath57 the state vector for the remaining ( bulk ) electrons which move in 3d .",

    "finally @xmath63 is the photo electron state .",
    "one may argue that the hole should be extended over the 2d layer rather than sit in one point .",
    "however even in weakly correlated solids correlation effects give rise to satellites corresponding rather to the removal of the electron from a point than from an extended region .",
    "@xcite for the strongly correlated systems considered here the band is quite narrow and thus the atomic functions building the bloch functions have small overlaps , which makes our approximation of a localized hole even better .",
    "we consider processes when the photo electron energy is high enough that we have reached the sudden limit as far as the excited layer is concerned ( about 10 ev according to ref .",

    "we take the states of a particular 2d layer as given and study the effect to low order of the sudden appearance of a hole in the 2d system on the quasi - bosons ( intrinsic excitations ) as well as of the coupling of the photoelectron leaving this layer to the quasi - bosons ( extrinsic excitations ) , and their interference ( c f eqs .",
    "8 - 10 , or equivalently eq",
    ". 26 in appendix a ) .",
    "we found that the intrinsic contributions dominate for small excitation energies .",
    "tunneling is traditionally described by the spectral function which involves matrix elements of the electron annihilation operator between the initial state and the excited states .",
    "@xcite,@xcite the excited states consist of a 2d layer state with a hole , and some state of the quasi - bosons in the presence of a localized hole . in lowest order perturbation theory the probability for a final state with excited quasi - bosons is given by the first term in eq . 10 .",
    "this means that _ the intrinsic contribution to pes and the tunneling currents are the same except for _ the mean free path effect in pes shown in eq .",
    "8 , and the summation over momenta in tunneling ( giving the density of states , dos ) contra momentum conservation from the dipole matrix element in pes .",
    "as mentioned above , we modify this analysis valid for the normal state , by simply assuming that the loss function should have a gap in the superconducting state .",
    "in bi2212 we have a van hove singularity ( vhs ) at the fermi level , which makes the difference between dos and momentum conservation of less importance ( there might actually even be two vhs if the two @xmath2 planes at @xmath260 apart produce a significant splitting ) .",
    "more important is that in pes the electrons come from a thin surface region ( of the order of the mean free path ) while in tunneling they may come from an extended region which can be hundreds of @xmath135 , and that the coupling functions @xmath261 are strongly @xmath71-dependent .",
    "additionally there are two energy gaps ( superconducting gap and pseudogap ) , which further complicates the picture .",
    "there is thus no way that pes and tunneling structures can be quantitatively the same , but since the same quasi - bosons are involved , there may well be qualitative similarities even though the coupling strengths can be quite different .",
    "it should also be noted that we take the spectral function for the 2d system as a sharp peak ( the function often calculated by theoreticians using say a @xmath262 model ) , and have no means to estimate the relative strengths of the true 2d spectral function relative to the loss structure analyzed here .    in our analysis we have only treated the plasmons for the simple reason that the experimental loss data at hand did not have resolution enough to show phonons and other low energy excitations .",
    "if such ( @xmath263 ) data appear showing additional quasi - bosons one is faced with introducing reasonable dispersions , and finding reasonable extrapolations of the bulk coupling function to account for the presence of the surface .",
    "this paper is concerned with effects of external losses in photo emission , and the extent to which the commonly used sudden approximation works for strongly correlated layered materials .",
    "we have earlier found that for a strongly correlated _",
    "localized _ system the sudden approximation is reached rather quickly , at about @xmath264 @xcite . for a weakly correlated system on the other hand , like an sp - metal or semiconductor",
    ", the sudden limit is approached very slowly , on the kev scale .",
    "@xcite the slow approach is connected with strong destructive interference between the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms for plasmon production .",
    "the cancellation is particularly strong for small momentum plasmons where the long - wave plasmons are excited by the average potential from the core hole and photo electron , which is zero @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric lineshape in core electron photo emission from metals is , on the other hand , hardly affected by the external loss processes @xcite .",
    "we are interested in energies where the sudden limit is reached for the strongly correlated layer from which the photo electron comes , and derive an expression for the photo current as a convolution of the sudden approximation for the current from the layer with an effective loss function , @xmath130 ( eq . [ mainpes ] ) .",
    "we assume , as far as the loss properties are concerned , that the photo electron comes from a localized position . in our specific example , @xmath170 , the @xmath181 value is @xmath265 ( neglecting crystallographic shear ) , and almost all contributions come from the first unit cell .",
    "the two first @xmath2 layers are at @xmath266 and @xmath267 from the surface ( which is between two @xmath268 layers ) .",
    "@xcitewith a photon energy of @xmath269 the maximum electron energy ( inside the solid ) is @xmath270 if we take the bandwidth as @xmath271 .",
    "our energy loss calculations give @xmath272 ( fig .",
    "the @xmath273 factor then is @xmath274 and @xmath275 for the first four @xmath2 layers .",
    "we thus expect large photo emission contributions only from the first unit cell .",
    "to obtain @xmath130 we use a previously developed method based on a quasi boson  model , where the electron - boson coupling is given by fluctuation potentials related to the dielectric response function @xcite .",
    "we find that the energy loss function , which we take from experimental data , can be related to the screened potential which we need to calculate the ( intrinsic and extrinsic ) losses in photo emission .",
    "the fluctuation potentials related to the electrons in the layers are universal functions , which are easily calculated ( eqs [ vfluct1 ] and [ vfluct2 ] ) .",
    "they have some resemblance to a surface plasmon potential , but penetrate the whole solid and have the bloch wave symmetry .",
    "we use the real part ( or equivalently the imaginary part ) of a phase shifted bulk potential to get a potential which is zero at the surface , and mimics the potential we have in a finite solid .",
    "the fluctuation potential is integrated over @xmath71 together with a propagation function @xmath118 ( eq . [ f(z ) ] ) that takes the photo electron out of the solid .",
    "this integral is in turn integrated with the loss function ( taken from experiment ) , im@xmath276 , to give functions @xmath222 and @xmath277 which are simply related to the effective loss function @xmath130 ( eq . [ exp3 ] ) .",
    "when we use plane waves instead of bloch functions in the propagation function @xmath118 , all specific materials properties are embodied in the loss function .",
    "the propagation function has both an intrinsic and an extrinsic contribution which interfere .    from eq .",
    "[ exp3 ] we see that @xmath130 is scaled down with @xmath55 , the distance of the layer from the surface , while the fluctuation potentials increase with @xmath71 .",
    "the reason for that increase is that the boundary condition forces the fluctuation potential in the first unit cell to be much weaker than the bulk potential ( c f figs 3 and 4 ) .",
    "the contributions to the @xmath200 functions from excitations in different layers are shown in fig 5 for photoemission from different layers .",
    "the mean free path is found to be considerably longer than obtained by norman et al @xcite , about @xmath278 rather than @xmath279 , at say @xmath280 ( fig .",
    "measurements by the itr-2pp technique @xcite give a lifetime of @xmath281 at an energy @xmath282  above the fermi surface .",
    "the mean free path is @xmath283 .",
    "converting energy to velocity by @xmath284 gives a mean free path @xmath285 as compared to our result of about @xmath286 at that energy .",
    "this is an indication that our values rather are on the low side .",
    "it is however hard to know what is the correct conversion between energy and velocity at such low energies , which makes a comparison very uncertain .    from fig .",
    "1 we see that the 2d losses occur only for small energies , at @xmath287 the bulk losses take over .",
    "the 2d losses go to zero quite slowly , just like the bulk losses , but on another energy scale . if we only had 2d losses , the minimum mean free path",
    "would be long , about @xmath288 .",
    "the general behavior of the 3d  mean free path follows a well known pattern .",
    "the mean free path has a minimum of about @xmath289 at an energy of 3 - 4 times the energy where the loss function has its center of gravity .",
    "we have used the born approximation to evaluate the mean free paths .",
    "this may seem a very crude approximation at low energies .",
    "however the born scattering expression with a basis of bloch waves and bloch energies rather than plane waves and free electron energies agrees with the gw approximation , which is commonly used also at low energies .",
    "further it was shown by campillo et al @xcite that plane waves and free electron energies was not that bad , as long as the energies in the dielectric function are well approximated .",
    "our main concern is the behavior of the effective broadening function at small energies where it is dominated by the 2d losses .",
    "the 3d contributions set in at somewhat higher energies , and give a rather structure - less contribution .",
    "what we here for convenience call 2d losses is of course actually also a 3d effect since it comes form excitations of a coupled set of 2d layers . to allow a qualitative discussion",
    "we represent the @xmath290 functions by a rectangular distribution .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "5 this may seem rather crude , but fig .",
    "8 shows that the corresponding @xmath291 functions are not too different .",
    "the rectangular distribution allows an analytic solution ( eq .",
    "[ pth ] ) valid out to the cut - off @xmath256 ( @xmath292 ) .",
    "@xmath291 has only a fairly small tail beyond @xmath256 . in fig .",
    "9 we plot the total @xmath130 function ( sum over the four first layers , properly mean free path weighted ) , calculated with the rectangular approximation and broadened with lorentzians of different widths .",
    "we note the marked asymmetry .",
    "the asymmetry is described by an index @xmath239 , defined in eq .",
    "[ gammaas ] .",
    "when @xmath293 derives from only one ( rectangular ) @xmath200-function @xmath239 is a function of the singularity index @xmath294 .",
    "the index @xmath239 is then independent of the amount of lorentzian broadening @xmath224 .",
    "if the @xmath295 function has a power law singularity with singularity index @xmath296 , the asymmetry index contains the sum of the two indices , @xmath297 .    in fig .",
    "7 we plot contributions to the loss function @xmath298 from different layers .",
    "it is interesting that the first two layers give about the same contribution , while the contributions from the next two are tiny . in the left part of fig .",
    "6 we show the importance of the intrinsic contributions to @xmath207 . the behavior here is thus similar to what was found previously for metals . @xcite in the right part of fig .",
    "6 we show the approach to the bulk limit curves .",
    "this approach is very slow for @xmath207 while , like in metals , it is fast for @xmath208 .",
    "the slow approach for @xmath207 of course comes from the slow approach to the bulk limit of the 2d fluctuation potentials ( fig .",
    "4 ) .    in a paper by liu , anderson and allen from 1991 @xcite",
    ", they discussed the lineshapes of @xmath299 along the @xmath300 direction obtained by olsen et al @xcite for @xmath301 photons .",
    "they concluded that neither the fermi liquid nor the marginal fermi liquid theories could fit the slow fall - off of the spectrum at higher energies .",
    "our results offer a possibility that the slow falloff may be due to intrinsic creation of acoustic plasmons in a coupled set of @xmath2 layers , an effect not present if only one @xmath2 layer is considered .",
    "this broadening is mostly intrinsic , i e if we treat a 3d system we have an almost intrinsic effect .",
    "however most theoretical discussions concern an isolated 2d system , compared to which we find an appreciable extra broadening from the coupling between the layers .    the pes spectra change strongly when we go to the superconducting state .",
    "the main peak sharpens and a peak - dip - hump structure develops .",
    "this effect has been interpreted as a coupling of the 2d  state to the @xmath302 collective mode .",
    "@xcite  here we find that this effect also can arise from the gapping of the loss function caused by the lack of low energy excitations in a superconductor as shown in fig .",
    "10 . without a more accurate model",
    "we find it difficult to decide which is the correct explanation , possibly it could be a combination of both mechanisms .",
    "since the gapping of the loss function is related to the superconducting gap , also with our mechanism the hump will scale with the gap .",
    "it is clear that the experimental peak - dip - hump structure rides on a background which is not predicted by our expressions , nor by anyone else s .",
    "our theory is however rather schematic with its strict separation of a 2d and a 3d part , while in reality the bands are hybridized .",
    "if we extend our approach to a more detailed treatment of the underlying bandstructure , the background could well be strongly changed .",
    "such an extension represents a very large numerical task but with the present pilot treatment we can at least start thinking seriously about the difficult background problems in photoemission .    in recent papers",
    "joynt et al @xcite discussed a broadening mechanism due to the interaction between the photo electron when outside the solid and the electrons in the solid .",
    "this is a different mechanism than in this paper , which adds additional broadening .",
    "their discussion only involved the energy loss part and not the elastic contribution and can thus not be directly compared to experiment .",
    "we hence find their claims regarding pseudogaps uncertain .",
    "it should be stressed that we can not claim any high quantitative accuracy .",
    "we have put in dispersion in the loss function using a crude approximation .",
    "since however dispersion is very important we think our predictions are substantially better than if dispersion had been neglected . we have only considered normal emission where the electrons come from the @xmath224 point , while the interesting experiments concern electrons from the fermi surface .",
    "however there is no reason that the effective loss function should change qualitatively when we go away from normal emission .",
    "the behavior of the loss function when @xmath303 has been disputed .",
    "most authors seem to believe the approach is linear , but there are also claims that it should be quadratic . @xcite",
    "if it were quadratic , the corresponding @xmath200-function would start linearly rather than with a constant .",
    "however @xmath304 would have to rise very fast to reproduce the behavior of the loss function for the ( quite small ) energies where it is known to be approximately linear .",
    "thus the pure power law behavior of @xmath305 would be lost , but lorentzian broadened curves would probably not differ much .",
    "our fluctuation potentials are obtained by phase - shifting bulk potentials to make them zero at the surface , and define them as zero outside the solid .",
    "this procedure turned out to be fairly good in the metallic case , where we could check with more accurately calculated fluctuation potentials .",
    "again this approximation is crude , but we believe it to be fundamentally better than if we had used a step function on the bulk potential . since the phase of the bulk potential is arbitrary , such a procedure would anyhow have been arbitrary . to calculate more accurate potentials  is a very large numerical undertaking .    one may also question the use of a bulk expression to estimate of the mean free path at the fairly low energies that we are concerned with , after all we found strong effects when  modifying the fluctuation potentials for surface effects . it does not seem easy to make a strong statement here , and we can only refer to  the state of the art  , that bulk mean free paths are successfully used in leed and also in low energy life time calculations which are compared with time - resolved two - photon pes ( tr-2ppe ) experiments .",

    "<S> new expressions are derived for photoemission , which allow experimental electron energy loss data to be used for estimating losses in photoemission . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation builds on new results for dielectric response and mean free paths of strongly correlated systems of two dimensional layers . </S>",
    "<S> numerical evaluations are made for @xmath0 ( bi2212 ) by using a parametrized loss function . </S>",
    "<S> the mean free path for bi2212 is calculated and found to be substantially larger than obtained by norman et al in a recent paper . </S>",
    "<S> the photocurrent is expressed as the convolution of the intrinsic approximation for the current from a specific 2d layer with an effective loss function . </S>",
    "<S> this effective loss function is the same as the photocurrent from a core level stripped of the dipole matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> the observed current is the sum of such currents from the first few layers . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation within one layer is considered as a purely two - dimensional ( 2d ) problem separate from the embedding three dimensional ( 3d ) environment . when the contribution to the dielectric response from electrons moving in 3d is taken as diagonal in @xmath1 space , </S>",
    "<S> its effect is just to replace bare coulomb potentials in the ( 3d ) coupling between the 2d layers with dynamically screened ones . </S>",
    "<S> the photo electron from a specific @xmath2 layer is found to excite low energy acoustic plasmon modes due to the coupling between the @xmath2  layers . </S>",
    "<S> these modes give rise to an asymmetric power law broadening of the photo current an isolated two dimensional layer would have given . </S>",
    "<S> we define an asymmetry index where a contribution from a luttinger lineshape is additive to the contribution from our broadening function . </S>",
    "<S> already the loss effect considered here gives broadening comparable to what is observed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> our theory is not related to the loss mechanism recently discussed by joynt et al , which adds additional broadening beyond what we calculate . </S>",
    "<S> a superconductor with a gapped loss function is predicted to have a peak - dip - hump lineshape similar to what has been observed , and with the same qualitative behavior as predicted in the recent work by campuzano et al .    2 </S>"
