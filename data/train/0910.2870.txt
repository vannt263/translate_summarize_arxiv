    "nonnegative_. however , such a conclusion is only an illusion . since the first theoretical demonstration about the existence of macrostates with negative heat capacities @xmath1 by lyndel - bell in the astrophysical context @xcite",
    ", this anomaly has been observed in several systems @xcite . the fluctuation relation ( [ can.cfr ] ) directly follows from the consideration of the gibbs canonical ensemble : @xmath9 which accounts for the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of a system in thermal contact with a heat bath at constant temperature @xmath10 when other thermodynamical variables like the system volume @xmath11 or a magnetic field @xmath12 are kept fixed , where @xmath13 . as elsewhere shown @xcite ,",
    "macrostates with @xmath1 can exist within the microcanonical description of a given system , but these states are _ thermodynamically unstable _ under the external influence imposed to the system within the gibbs canonical ensemble .",
    "a suitable extension of this standard result has been recently derived @xcite : @xmath14 which considers a _ system - surroundings _ equilibrium situation where the inverse temperature @xmath15 of a given thermostat exhibits correlated fluctuations with the total energy @xmath16 of the system under study as a consequence of the underlying thermodynamic interaction .",
    "this last generalization differs from the canonical equilibrium situation in the fact that the internal thermodynamical state of the thermostat can be affected by the presence of the system under study , constituting in this way a more general framework than the usual canonical @xmath17 and microcanonical ensembles @xmath18 .",
    "the new fluctuation relation ( [ unc ] ) defines a criterion capable of detecting the presence of a regime with @xmath1 in the microcanonical caloric curve @xmath19 of the system through the correlated fluctuations of the inverse temperature @xmath20 and the energy @xmath16  of the system itself .",
    "in fact , it asserts that macrostates with @xmath1 are thermodynamically stable provided that the influence of the thermostat obeyed the inequality @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , any attempt to impose the canonical conditions @xmath22 leads to very large energy fluctuations @xmath23 that induce the thermodynamic instability of such anomalous macrostates .",
    "as already discussed in a previous work @xcite , the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ unc ] ) has interesting connections with different questions within statistical mechanics , such as the extension of canonical monte carlo methods to allow the study macrostates with negative heat capacities and to avoid the super - critical slowing down of first - order phase transitions @xcite , the justification of a complementary relation between energy and temperature @xcite , the development of a geometric formulation for fluctuation theory @xcite , as well as the mandelbrot s derivation of statistical mechanics from inference theory @xcite .",
    "however , eq.([unc ] ) is applicable to those equilibrium situations where there is only involved the conjugated pair energy - temperature .",
    "thus , this result merely constitutes a first step towards the development of an extension of _ equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relations _ compatible with the existence of anomalous response functions @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall extend our previous results to an equilibrium situation with several control parameters , that is , we shall develop a special approach of fluctuation theory @xcite in order to arrive at a suitable generalization of the familiar fluctuation relations : @xmath24 compatible with the existence of macrostates with _ anomalous values in response functions _ , such as negative heat capacities @xmath25 , isothermal compressibilities @xmath26 or isothermal magnetic susceptibilities @xmath27 in those magnetic systems where this response function is expected to be nonnegative .",
    "from the standard perspective of statistical mechanics , a system - surroundings equilibrium situation with several control parameters is customarily described by using the _ boltzmann - gibbs distributions _",

    ", we shall consider the boltzmann s constant @xmath37 along this work , so that , @xmath38 in eq.([bgd ] ) represents the inverse temperature , @xmath39 .",
    "conventionally , the system energy @xmath16 is the most important physical observable in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics , and hence , it is always distinguished from the other macroscopic observables @xmath40 .",
    "however , we shall not start from this distinction in the present approach , a consideration that allows us to deal with a more simple notation in our analysis .",
    "let us consider the following convention for the physical observables @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the thermodynamic parameters , in a way that the total differential of entropy @xmath43 can be rewritten as follows : @xmath44 .",
    "we will use hereafter the einstein s summation convention , which allows to rewrite the probabilistic weight of the boltzmann - gibbs distribution ( [ bgd ] ) as : @xmath45      at first glance , all that it is necessary to demand in order to extend fluctuation relations ( [ familiar.fd ] ) is to start from a probabilistic distribution more general than the boltzmann - gibbs distributions ( [ bgd ] ) . from a mathematical point of view , a distribution that seems to describe the thermodynamical behavior of a system under a general influence of an environment is the ansatz : @xmath46 whose generic probabilistic weight @xmath47 admits the boltzmann - gibbs form ( [ bg.w ] ) as a particular case .",
    "we shall shown in the next subsections that the hypothesis ( [ new ] ) , although simple , is sufficiently general to achieve our purposes .",
    "in fact , this expression is just a direct extension of the ansatz used in our previous work @xcite : @xmath48 to a more general case with several macroscopic observables .",
    "let us now discuss under what general background conditions the mathematical form ( [ new ] ) can be supported by physical arguments .",
    "a particular and conventional situation is that where the system under study and its environment can be considered as two _ separable and independent finite subsystems _ that constitute a closed system in thermodynamic equilibrium . by admitting only additive physical observables ( e.g. : energy , volume , particles number or electric charge ) obeying the constraint @xmath49 ,",
    "a simple ansatz for the distribution function is given by : @xmath50where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the densities of states of the system and the environment , respectively , and @xmath53 , the partition function that ensures the normalization condition : @xmath54 here , @xmath55 represents all admissible values of the system observables @xmath56 .",
    "although eq.([pp1 ] ) provides a simple interpretation for eq.([new ] ) , it clearly dismisses some important practical situations where the _ additive constraint _",
    "@xmath57 can not be ensured for all physical observables involved in the system - environment thermodynamic interaction .",
    "significant examples of _ unconstrained observables _ are the magnetization @xmath58 or the electric polarization @xmath59 associated with magnetic and electric systems respectively . a formal way to overcome such a difficulty",
    "is carried out by representing the density of state of the environment @xmath60 in terms of the observables of the system @xmath56 under study and the set of control parameters @xmath61 of the given physical situation , @xmath62 .",
    "such an explicit dependence of the density of states of the environment on the internal state of the system follows from their mutual interaction , which leads to the existence of _ correlative effects _ between these systems .",
    "thus , one can express the corresponding distribution function as follows : @xmath63the subset @xmath64 of all admissible values of the physical observables @xmath56 now depend on the control parameters @xmath61 .",
    "rigorously speaking , both _",
    "separability _ and _ additivity _ represent suitable idealizations of the real physical conditions associated with the large thermodynamic systems with a microscopic dynamics driven by short - range interactions .",
    "these conditions can not be naively extended to systems with long - range interactions , which constitute a relevant framework for the existence of macrostates with anomalous response functions . as already mentioned in the introductory section ,",
    "remarkable examples are the astrophysical systems , whose thermodynamic description is hallmarked by the existence of _ negative heat capacities _ @xmath1 .",
    "although one can not trivially divide a long - range interacting system into independent subsystems , an _ effective separability _ can be arisen as a direct consequence of the underlying microscopic dynamics in some practical situations .",
    "for example , it is physically admissible to speak about a separability between a globular cluster and its nearby galaxy despite of the long - range character of the gravitational interaction .",
    "since separability is , at least , an important condition to attribute a reasonable physical meaning to the description of a system as an individual entity , we shall demand this property as necessary requirement for the applicability of the ansatz ( [ new ] ) .",
    "the existence of long - range interactions also implies the incidence of _ long - range correlations_. this last feature , by itself , modifies in a significant way the thermodynamic behavior and the macroscopic dynamics of a physical system . if one considers the existing analogy with conventional systems at the _ critical points _ ( where correlation length @xmath65 diverges , @xmath66 ) , the dynamics of long - range interacting systems should undergo the existence of some collective phenomena with a very slow relaxation towards the final equilibrium @xcite , as example , the so - called _ violent relaxation _ that appears during the _ collisionless dynamics _ of the astrophysical systems @xcite . under this last circumstance",
    ", it is usual that a long - range interacting system can not be found in a final thermodynamic equilibrium , but in a long - living _ quasi - stationary state _",
    "the above dynamical features establish certain analogies among the long - range interacting systems with other physical systems with a complex microscopic dynamics such as _ turbulent fluids _",
    "@xcite and _ glassy systems",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "according to the above reasonings , one can not expect that the probabilistic weight @xmath67 in eq.([new ] ) can be always interpreted in terms of the density of states of the environment @xmath68 as the cases associated with eqs.([pp1 ] ) or ( [ ansatz2 ] ) , since they demand the existence of a final thermodynamic equilibrium and the non - incidence of long - range interactions .",
    "certainly , few systems in nature are in absolute and final equilibrium , since it presupposes that all radiative materials would decayed completely and the nuclear reactions would have transmuted all nuclei to the most stable of isotopes . thus , the hypothesis about the existence of a metastable equilibrium could be sufficient for the applicability of thermodynamics in many practical situations .",
    "hereafter , we shall assume that _ the probabilistic weight _",
    "_ accounts for a general thermodynamic influence of an environment _ , which is found , at least , in conditions of _ meta - stability_. this type of _ ad hoc _ hypothesis , that is , the using of _ generalized statistical ensemble _ with the form ( [ new ] ) , is usual in the statistical mechanics literature in the last decades .",
    "this kind of methodology has proved to be an useful alternative to describe thermodynamic features of systems with a complex microscopic dynamics .",
    "the reader can find an unifying framework of all these generalized distribution functions in the so - called _ superstatistics _ , a theory recently proposed by c. beck and e.g.d cohen @xcite .",
    "the specific mathematical form of the probabilistic weight @xmath67 depends , in general , on the internal structure of the environment , the character of its own equilibrium conditions , and the nature of forces driving the underlying system - environment thermodynamic interaction . fortunately",
    ", the exact mathematical form of the function @xmath69 is unimportant in our subsequent development . despite of its generality",
    ", we shall show that the internal thermodynamic state of the environment is fully characterized by a finite set of _ control thermodynamic parameters _ @xmath70 that constitute a natural extension of the constant parameters @xmath71 of the boltzmann - gibbs distributions ( [ bg.w ] ) .",
    "such a reduced description is analogous to the equilibrium situation described within the gibbs canonical ensemble ( [ can ] ) , where the external influence is determined by the thermostat temperature @xmath10 regardless its internal structure and composition , as long as the thermostat exhibited a very large heat capacity and guaranteed a thermal contact with the system under analysis .      the direct way to arrive at a suitable extension of the thermodynamic control parameters @xmath72 of the boltzmann - gibbs distributions ( [ bg.w ] )",
    "is achieved by appealing to the _ conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium _ such as the condition of _ thermal equilibrium _ , @xmath73 , the condition of _ mechanical equilibrium _ , @xmath74 , the condition of _ chemical equilibrium _ , @xmath75 , etc .",
    "as usual , the conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium can be derived as the _ stationary conditions _ associated with the _ most likely macrostate _",
    "@xmath76 of the distribution function @xmath77 : @xmath78 which can be conveniently rewritten as follows : @xmath79 here , @xmath80 are the system ( microcanonical ) thermodynamic parameters : @xmath81 derived from the _ coarsed grained _ entropy @xmath82 with @xmath83 ( @xmath84 is a small constant which makes the volume @xmath85 dimensionless ) , while _ the quantities _",
    "defined by _ : @xmath87 _ are the control thermodynamic parameters of the environment_. this last definition constitutes a fundamental consideration in the present development .",
    "as expected , the environment control thermodynamic parameters ( [ eff.temp ] ) drop to the constant parameters @xmath88 of the boltzmann - gibbs distributions ( [ bg.w ] ) by replacing the general probabilistic weight @xmath89 by the one associated with this last ensemble @xmath90 .",
    "similarly , they drop to its microcanonical definitions ( [ micro.bb ] ) when the environment is just a short - range interacting system in a final thermodynamic equilibrium , that is , when the probabilistic weight @xmath91 is proportional to the states density @xmath68 .",
    "however , these thermodynamic parameters turn _ effective _ in the other cases , overall , in those practical situations where the probabilistic weight @xmath92 corresponds to an environment in a _ metastable or quasi - stationary equilibrium_. the possibility to extend this type of thermodynamic concepts to situations of metastability is not strange , since there exist robust evidences supporting the introduction of concept of _ effective temperature _ in non - equilibrium systems ( see in ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a remarkable feature of the environment thermodynamic parameters ( [ eff.temp ] ) is _ their implicit dependence on the instantaneous macrostate _",
    "@xmath56 _ of the system _ , since these thermodynamic quantities are only constant for the particular case of the boltzmann - gibbs distributions .",
    "consequently , it is almost a rule rather than an exception that _ the underlying system - environment interaction provokes the existence of non - vanishing correlated fluctuations among the environment thermodynamic parameters and system observables _ , @xmath93 .",
    "such a realistic behavior of the interacting macroscopic systems is systematically disregarded by the use of boltzmann - gibbs distributions ( [ bg.w ] ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath94 act as control parameters during the system - environment thermodynamic interaction .",
    "a simple way to illustrate this role is by using the probabilistic weight @xmath95 in the metropolis monte carlo simulation @xcite of the system under the present equilibrium conditions .",
    "the acceptance probability for a metropolis move @xmath96 is given by : @xmath97 the fluctuations of the macroscopic observables satisfy the condition @xmath98 whenever the size @xmath99 of the system is sufficiently large , allowing in this way to introduce the following approximation : @xmath100 and rewrite the acceptance probability ( [ p1 ] ) in an analogous fashion to the usual metropolis algorithm based on the boltzmann - gibbs weight ( [ bg.w ] ) : @xmath101 , 1\\right\\ }   . \\label{met.b}\\ ] ] this last expression shows that the environment thermodynamic parameters ( [ eff.temp ] ) provide a simple extension of control parameters of boltzmann - gibbs distribution ( [ bg.w ] ) .",

    "the analysis yields : @xmath413 where @xmath61 is the inverse of the isothermal magnetic susceptibility per particle , @xmath414 , whose value can be estimated from the previous simulation as the case of parameters @xmath415 in eq.([ser ] ) .",
    "notice that this optimal value guarantees the validity of stability condition ( [ mag.cond ] ) .",
    "results of extensive monte carlo simulations by using the procedure explained above are shown in fig.[anomalous.eps ] .",
    "we have used a square lattice with @xmath416 and considered @xmath417 iterations for each calculated point .",

    "we only show here macrostates with @xmath420 due to the underlying symmetry @xmath421 and @xmath422 of the enthalpy @xmath309 .    as clearly shown in fig.[comparison.eps ] , while the 2d ising model isotherms are able to describe a backbending in the @xmath410 diagram under a magnetic influence obeying stability condition ( [ mag.cond ] ) , they merely undergo a sudden jump in magnetization in turns to the point @xmath369 under the influence of a constant magnetic field , that is , a situation with @xmath423 .",
    "as already commented , such a sudden jump is interpreted as the occurrence of a discontinuous phase transition in conventional statistical mechanics , whose existence is a direct manifestation of the presence of an unstable branch with negative susceptibilities @xmath27 .",
    "our monte carlo simulations show that such an anomalous region can turn accessible with an appropriate selection of the external experimental conditions .",
    "the present results can be extended to the case of fluid systems .",
    "in fact , the behavior of the 2d ising model isotherms is fully analogous to the well - known backbending of van der waal gas isotherms in the @xmath424 diagram , which is associated with macrostates with negative isothermal compressibilities @xmath26 @xcite .",

    "remarkably , the physics behind the generalized equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relations ( [ gfdr ] ) is quite simple .",
    "the key ingredient relies on the that the environment thermodynamic parameters @xmath426 undergo in general correlated fluctuations with the system observables @xmath427 as a consequence of the underlying thermodynamic interaction .",
    "such a realistic behavior , systematically disregarded by the using of boltzmann - gibbs distributions ( [ bg.w ] ) , leads to the consideration of a new correlation matrix @xmath301 in the equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relations , eq.([a2.fr ] ) , which characterizes the existence of these correlative effects .",
    "the new theorem explicitly expresses that the system fluctuating behavior and its thermodynamic stability crucially depend on the nature of the external influence of the environment .",
    "as example of applications , we have obtained particular expressions of the generalized equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relations for a fluid and magnetic systems .",
    "after , we have derived two criteria of thermodynamic stability accounting for the existence of negative heat capacities : eq.([thirring.eq ] ) , for systems with short - range interactions ensuring the existence of a _ thermal contact _ ; and eq.([astro.cond ] ) , for a metastable equilibrium involving long - range interactions between a globular cluster and its nearby galaxy . finally , we have arrived at a stability condition compatible with anomalous isothermal susceptibilities associated with the occurrence of a discontinuous phase transition in magnetic systems , eq.([mag.cond ] ) , whose consequences have been also numerically tested throughout monte carlo simulations .",
    "we would like mention some open questions deserving a special attention in future works :    * the usual equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relations ( [ can1 ] )  constitute a particular expression of the so - called _ fluctuation - dissipation theorem _ : @xmath428 relating correlations and response functions in linear response theory @xcite .",
