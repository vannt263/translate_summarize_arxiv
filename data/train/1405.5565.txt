    "the performance of adaptive optics ( ao ) is strongly dependent on the quality of the wavefront sensing measurements from the guide stars because they directly affect the correction error @xcite . for the shack - hartmann ( sh )",
    "wavefront sensors , currently the better adapted sensor for laser guide stars on large telescopes , the standard deviation measurement error ( @xmath0 ) is a function of the spot size and the number of photons received per subaperture and per frame according to @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the spot image in the focal plane of a sh subaperture , and @xmath3 is the average number of photons received in a sh subaperture each frame .",
    "therefore , the smaller the spot image or the greater the number of received photons , the better the measurement accuracy .",
    "this article analyzes the case of the gemini south multi - conjugate ao system ( gems ) @xcite which uses a single sodium laser to generate a constellation of 5 laser guide stars on sky .",
    "the size of the spot image @xmath2 depends on various parameters , among which the laser spot size in the sodium layer , the elongation of the seen spot due to the sodium layer thickness , the diffraction produced by the sh subaperture size and the atmospheric seeing .",
    "for the first two years of operations of gems during the season of low sodium concentration ( december - january ) , the system frame rate had to be frequently reduced compared to its maximum of 800  hz in order to guarantee the average detection of at least @xmath4 photons per subaperture per frame from each laser guide star @xcite .",
    "this minimum flux is required for adequate closed - loop ao correction by gems . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmae ] ) , if the image spot size @xmath2 is reduced by 15% , it is equivalent for a given ao noise level to increase the number of photons by 40% .",
    "laser - based ao systems usually being designed with little margin in terms of expected photons return , it appears all the more important to minimize the spot size .    in laser specifications ,",
    "the smallest laser spot possible is obtained if the 589  nm beam to be projected has a beam quality factor @xmath5 @xcite . any discrepancy from this ideal shape results in @xmath6 values greater than 1 .",
    "an estimation of the @xmath6 of a laser can be computed using a sh to measure the beam irradiance and wavefront at waist @xcite and by using the discrete fourier transform of the resulting complex field , the far - field distribution can also be computed . from each of these fields ,",
    "the standard deviation of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 axis margin distribution of the beam intensity , can be obtained . using the notations @xmath9 and @xmath10 for this quantity along @xmath11direction at the waist and in the far - field respectively ,",
    "the @xmath6 is estimated by @xmath12    during the 2011/2012 commissioning campaign , the measured @xmath6 factors on gems were below 1.5 and 1.3 , in @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively @xcite .",
    "a beam quality @xmath6 close to 1 has not been achieved so far with gems laser .",
    "the @xmath6 values even worsened during the first half of 2013 , revealing significant degradation of the laser beam quality with time .",
    "the laser beam has been measured right at the output of the laser bench using a dedicated shack - hartmann sensor .",
    "the obtained irradiance maps are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : irrmap ] for sets of measurements taken in april and october 2013 .",
    "note that these measurements were both made after several days of alignment optimization , _ i.e. _ on the best laser shape at each time . from the data of april 2013 , @xmath6 factors of 2.21 and 1.21 along @xmath7 and @xmath8 directions",

    "[ fig : irrmap ] . the dotted line represents the half of the maximum to quantify the fwhm and",
    "it shows that the beam diameter is between 1.5 and 2 times larger along @xmath7 than along @xmath8 .",
    "the beam quality is always worse in the @xmath7-axis with gems because it corresponds to the unguided dimension of the amplification stages in the waveguide amplifier module @xcite .",
    "in addition , a slow increase of the @xmath6 values over the length of the runs has also been noticed , suggesting that the system suffers from constant misalignment @xcite .",
    "the impact of this degraded shape of the beam on the laser intrinsic spot size has been previously quantified by including the measured irradiance of april 2013 ( top of fig .",
    "[ fig : irrmap ] ) in simulations of the uplink propagation of the laser from the launching telescope to the mesosphere @xcite .",
    "no phase aberrations were considered , but the beam was simulated for amplitude shapes different from that of a perfect gaussian shape .",
    "the same uplink simulation code is used to evaluate the impact of amplitude and phase distortions on the short - exposure spot size at the sodium layer .",
    "previous on - sky measurement of the laser intrinsic spot size of @xmath13 has been reported for gems @xcite .",
    "this number can not be directly compared to the values obtained with the simulation because there is not a strictly linear dependence of the laser return flux and the short - exposure irradiance focused at the sodium altitude .",
    "however , gems laser is not expected to induce saturation at the sodium layer , so the variance of the short - exposure irradiance over the sh subaperture field - of - view provides a good estimate of the spot size at a first order @xcite .",
    "in addition , the vertical distribution of the sodium layer is not taken into account in this computation , but its effect could be considered to globally increase of the spot size by 10% @xcite . simulating a seeing of 0.73  arcseconds at 500  nm ( median seeing over 33 gems observations nights between december 2012 and june 2013 @xcite ) , on averaged over 100 successive independent atmospheres , the obtained fwhm of the short - exposure spot ( arcseconds ) is :    * @xmath14 for a perfect gaussian beam with fwhm of 25  cm .",
    "* @xmath15 and @xmath16 considering only amplitude aberrations measured in april 2013 and in october 2013 respectively . * @xmath17 considering both amplitude and phase aberrations of the laser beam . the same value @xmath17 is obtained for april 2013 and for october 2013 .    for a given ao noise level ( in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmae ] ) ) , the reduced size of the short - exposure laser spot with a perfect gaussian beam compared to the distorted beam would be equivalent to an increase of the received number of photons by 30 to 45% .",
    "the beam degradation is understood as the result of quasi - static aberrations in both the laser bench and the beam transfer optics ( bto ) path @xcite .",
    "first , the co - alignment of the optical system for sum frequency generation used in gems is highly subject to temperature hysteresis , as well as telescope vibrations .",
    "this critical alignment tends to drift along a run .",
    "secondly , the bto is in a closed environment , with no turbulence , but the outside temperature can vary by 10 to 15 degrees , so aberrations along the bto are subject to slow evolutions .",
    "frequent and constraining calibrations and alignment procedures ( quasi - static aberrations ) are thus required in both parts to optimize the beam to launch .",
    "these complex and time - consuming alignment procedures currently used will strongly reduce the availability of gems @xcite .",
    "it may also affect the future generations of ao requiring high power laser and using beam transport by mirrors , as planned for the thirty meter telescope @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that recent research and development of fiber lasers for sodium guide stars @xcite have shown very promising laboratory results to produce lasers with better @xmath6 quality and high power .",
    "there is still few on - sky experience to guarantee that this new technology can solve all the problems for an ao system like gems , requiring a 50-watt laser .",
    "therefore the study of an automatic technique to improve the beam shape of the current laser in gems is considered highly desirable .",
    "the concept of a beam shaping system for laser - based astronomical ao was recently proposed @xcite and its potential benefit on the gems signal - to - noise ratio has been highlighted with preliminary simulations of the uplink propagation of the laser toward the sodium layer @xcite .",
    "this concept is studied here in greater detail , quantifying with numerical simulations the expected performance of the method with respect to design parameters .",
    "these results will be further used to develop an experimental prototype for such beam correction to be tested on gems laser .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : fieldconjugation ] , the architecture with two deformable mirrors for amplitude and phase correction is detailed . in sect .",
    "[ sec : eqs ] , the iterative algorithm used to deduce the commands for both mirrors is described with emphasis given to the iterative unwrapper required to solve the problem in practice .",
    "last in sect .",
    "[ sec : simu - field - conj ] , preliminary simulations of the beam shaping correction method are presented .",
    "the results confirm the ability to correct both amplitude and phase with this type of architectures .",
    "the influence of parameters like the separation distance between the mirrors , the number of iterations of the algorithm and the number of actuators of the mirrors are emphasized .",
    "in order to optimize the laser beam to be launched , correction of both amplitude and phase distortions of the beam is required .",
    "this is referred to as optical field conjugation or amplitude - phase correction @xcite .",
    "the presented concept takes its origins in the beam shaping research for laser radar and active coherent imaging ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . in these first studies ,",
    "the common goal was to produce an optical device which modifies the beam coming from a given source to lead to a desired irradiance distribution in the near - field . in order to avoid loss of energy , only refractive or reflective surfaces",
    "must be used to redistribute the energy .",
    "early works were focused on static shaping and lead to the difficult manufacturing of very specific optical components @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a more versatile solution where they transform a gaussian beam into a uniformly illuminated field using two computer - generated holographic elements . during the past two decades",
    ", several wavefront correction technologies were developed to match this low loss of energy and to provide also adaptive correction for evolving distortions introduced by propagation through turbulent media . among these , the micro - electro - mechanical systems ( mems ) deformable mirrors ( dm ) @xcite are now compact and robust device for beam shaping at least cost . in our study , we foresee to use two mems dms .    in the fields of defense industry and free space communications , the beam propagation through the atmosphere leads to strong amplitude distortions degrading the system performance . during the last two decades",
    ", a significant amount of research was generated for these applications to develop adaptive optics systems correcting for both amplitude and phase distortions of a beam @xcite .",
    "one of the first approach to tackle phase and amplitude correction simultaneously with two dms was proposed by kanev _",
    "the first dm corrects for the amplitude and the second one corrects for the phase .",
    "the concept has later been revised by roggemann _",
    "_ @xcite in a configuration where the second mirror is in the far - field of the first one .",
    "the scheme of such correction system is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dm - schemes](a ) , and it is referred to as _ mono - static _ because the receiving and projecting apertures are the same .",
    "the phase and amplitude corruption induced by the atmosphere in the optical path from the target above the aperture is supposed to be measured with a suitable device . it could be a sh sensor ,",
    "from which outputs need to be processed to compute the received amplitude and the phase of the field in the aperture plane of the telescope .",
    "the measurements are analyzed to deduce the commands to be sent to the dms in order to shape the laser beam to the conjugate of the received field , and project it .",
    "first , the laser collimated beam is supposed to fall upon dm1 , where a phase shape @xmath18 is added to the wave .",
    "this applied phase aims at modifying the amplitude shape of the wave in the fraunhofer region , after the fourier transforming mirror , when the wave is incident on dm2 . the second dm , dm2 , is optically conjugated to the pupil plane of the beam projecting aperture , so it only modifies the phase distribution of the output beam .",
    "a novel modification of the latter approach to near - field correction has been proposed by barchers _",
    "@xcite showing the potential interest of conjugating the first dm to a finite range where a turbulent layer could be present , instead of using a fourier transforming mirror .",
    "this kind of dual - dm systems to precompensate atmospheric turbulence effects on beacon has been used during the last two decades in the military and free - space communication fields .    in the adaptive optics systems for astronomy , only few studies tackled full optical field conjugation , because phase correction is by far more important than amplitude correction @xcite .",
    "the use of multiple dms in ao for astronomy are common for phase correction only and in tomographic configurations , aiming to correct the phase over a wide field of view like gems @xcite . nevertheless , amplitude distortions or _",
    "scintillation _ , being a source of loss of contrast in astrophysical imaging , gonsalves suggested @xcite to correct for amplitude distortions thanks to a second dm .",
    "again for higher contrast purposes , phase - induced amplitude apodization @xcite is an active are of research using aspheric mirrors for exo - planet imaging . and in the same field , multiple dms",
    "have recently be shown to provide polychromatic correction and allow to null the intensity in high strehl images @xcite .",
    "with respect to the lasers for astronomical ao , an on - going project studies the potential benefit of only phase correction before projection to the mesosphere @xcite .",
    "more recently another concept of laser beam cleanup with 2 dms has been presented @xcite but again it targets only phase distortions since the second dm is conjugated to the first one and is used only to increase the maximum spatial frequency of the correction and the stroke of the overall system . to the knowledge of the authors , the present study of amplitude and phase correction of the laser beam before projection for astronomical ao is new .",
    "the 2dm - system proposed here for astronomical purposes uses a second dm conjugated to a finite range , @xmath19 ( see fig .  [ fig:2dm - schemes](b ) ) .",
    "dm2 is in the near - field of the dm1 ( _ i.e. _ in the fresnel region ) , at a separation distance @xmath19 of the order of 1 meter .",
    "dm2 remains conjugated to the pupil plane of the beam projecting aperture as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dm - schemes](a ) ) .",
    "the near - field configuration should allow matching the space constraints of the laser systems on the telescope , although maintaining the ability to correct for amplitude and phase of the field .",
    "the primary objective of the 2-dm concept is to provide correction of quasi - static amplitude and phase aberrations affecting the beam before its projection .",
    "the distortions of gems laser such as the ones presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : irrmap ] have been observed to only evolve over a time scale of hours or days @xcite .",
    "the developed solution focuses only on these quasi - static distortions but the choice of deformable mirrors would allow in a further extension of the study to tackle optimizations at shorter time scales . for instance , it may be used to finely tune the focus of the output beam when variations of the sodium layer height occurs .",
    "the dms could also precompensate for the dynamical aberrations induced by the atmospheric turbulence in the propagation path of the laser above the launch telescope .",
    "this last extension is far from being straightforward however since the turbulence of interest is not directly measured . in astronomical laser - based systems ,",
    "the configuration would usually be _",
    "( _ cf . _ fig .",
    "[ fig:2dm - schemes](b ) ) , meaning that the laser launching telescope ( left ) is not the telescope measuring the atmospheric turbulence ( right ) . for on - axis launching of the laser , the turbulence above the secondary mirror , _",
    "i.e. _ behind the central obscuration of the laser - based ao system of the telescope , might be extrapolated for low - order modes corrected by the ground - conjugated dm of the ao .",
    "the atmospheric wavefront distortion would thus be known thanks to the adaptive optics of the telescope ( represented by _ ao sensing device _ in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dm - schemes](b ) ) , for which the receiving aperture is the primary mirror and does not coincide with the launching telescope .",
    "demonstration of such capability is yet unknown to the authors , so such dynamical extension of the correction is left for further research . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dm - schemes](b ) , the output of the ao sensing device is connected with a dashed arrow to the processing computer illustrating the fact that this option is not considered further in this paper .",
    "the correction of quasi - static amplitude and phase distortions is based on a given desired beam shape at the projection aperture , @xmath20 .",
    "the phase patterns to be applied to the dms are determined by a phase retrieval method @xcite like in most of the amplitude - phase correction systems mentioned before .",
    "the principle of the method is to iteratively estimate in two planes the phase shapes which match the amplitude and phase constraints in other planes ( _ e.g. _ image plane , conjugated plane ) , as far as they are linked by a propagation relation .",
    "the first phase retrieval methods were developed by gerchberg and saxton @xcite , gonsalves @xcite and fienup @xcite .",
    "fienup showed that these methods have the same local convergence properties around a fix point as the steepest descent and conjugated gradient algorithms @xcite .",
    "the intensive research on optical field conjugation for laser defense applications led to eventually demonstrate @xcite that algorithms for optical field conjugation , usually referred to as _ gerchberg - saxton algorithms _ , are applications of what is known as the method of sequential projections onto constraints sets @xcite .",
    "the algorithm presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : eqs ] is a version of gerchberg - saxton method adapted to account for the near - field separation of the dms and to unwrap the phases to be applied on dms .",
    "last , to bring the 2 dm correction concept to a practical implementation the method needs to provide phase estimates that can be efficiently reproduced by the mirrors .",
    "non - segmented mirrors do not perform well when phase cuts are present @xcite .",
    "phase cuts can occur because the phase estimate is wrapped and because of branch points @xcite . as shown later with simulations in sect .",
    "[ sec : simu - field - conj ] , the estimated phases in our context are very likely to be wrapped and to generate branch points where the field amplitude vanishes in the aperture .",
    "to avoid phase cuts , we developed a regularized iterative unwrapper ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : weight - ls - unwrapper ] ) to be applied to the phase estimates after every iteration of the phase - retrieval algorithm .",
    "the use of least squares and weighted least squares unwrappers have been reported in the literature related to beam shaping with dms @xcite .",
    "the least squares approach is not adapted to cases where the field intensity vanishes .",
    "a weighted least squares unwrapper allows to deal with degeneracies of the phase estimates where the intensity is zero , and thus avoid phase cuts .",
    "however , it is difficult to implement a weighted least squares unwrapper in practice because the weight based on the intensity distribution of the computed propagated field changes at every iteration of the phase retrieval algorithm .",
    "so the pseudo - inverse matrix required to apply the weighted least squares can not be precomputed only once .",
    "to overcome these difficulties , a novel iterative unwrapper is detailed in sect .",
    "[ sec : weight - ls - unwrapper ] .",
    "its weighting can be easily updated on the fly with every new field estimate and no precomputation of pseudo - inverse matrix is required .",
    "for the 2-dm design presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dm - schemes](b ) , the following notations are used .",
    "the incident field on dm1 is the one coming out from the laser bench and is noted @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the coordinate vector in the plane of dm1 , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 account for the aberrated amplitude and phase in this plane respectively .",
    "the field leaving dm1 is noted @xmath25 and is expressed as @xmath26 where @xmath18 is the phase pattern applied to dm1 and @xmath27 represents the reflection mask for the mirror , in order to account for the finite extension of the device .",
