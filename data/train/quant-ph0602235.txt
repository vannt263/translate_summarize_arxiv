    "quantum filtering theory was pioneered by belavkin in remarkable papers @xcite and was more lucidly reconsidered by bouten _ et al .",
    "this theory is now recognized as a very important basis for the development of various engineering applications of the quantum theory such as quantum feedback control @xcite , quantum dynamical parameter estimation @xcite , and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "we here provide a brief summary of the quantum filtering theory by using the same notations as those in @xcite .",
    "let us consider an open system in contact with a field , particularly a vacuum electromagnetic field .",
    "this interaction is completely described by a unitary operator @xmath0 that obeys the following quantum stochastic differential equation ( qsde ) termed the hudson - parthasarathy equation @xcite : @xmath1\\hat{u}_t,~~     \\hat{u}_0=\\hat{i},\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the system operator and hamiltonian , respectively .",
    "the quantum wiener process @xmath4 , which is a field operator , satisfies the following quantum ito rule : @xmath5 the time evolution of any system observable @xmath6 under the interaction ( [ hp - eq ] ) is described by the unitary transformation @xmath7 .",
    "the infinitesimal change in this transformation is calculated as @xmath8)d\\hat{b}_t                               + j_t([\\hat{x } , \\hat{c}])d\\hat{b}_t{^{\\dagger}}.\\ ] ] here , we have defined @xmath9 + \\hat{c}{^{\\dagger}}\\hat{x}\\hat{c}-{\\frac{1}{2}}\\hat{c}{^{\\dagger}}\\hat{c}\\hat{x } -{\\frac{1}{2}}\\hat{x}\\hat{c}{^{\\dagger}}\\hat{c}$ ] .",
    "the field operator after the interaction is determined by @xmath10 . in the homodyne detection scheme ,",
    "we measure the field operator of the form @xmath11 , which results in @xmath12 an important fact is that the above observable is _ self - nondemolition _ : @xmath13=0 $ ] for all @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that the observation is a classical stochastic process .",
    "( for this reason , we omit the  hat \" on @xmath16 , but note that it itself is not a @xmath17-number . )",
    "it is also noteworthy that @xmath16 satisfies the _ quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) _",
    "condition , @xmath18=0~\\forall s\\leq t$ ] , for all system observables @xmath6 . our goal is to obtain the best estimate of the system observable @xmath19 based on the observations @xmath20 , which generate the von neumann algebra @xmath21 . as in the case of the classical filtering theory , the best estimate in the sense of the least mean square error , @xmath22 ,",
    "is given by ( a version of ) the quantum conditional expectation : @xmath23 . here , the expectation @xmath24 is defined by @xmath25 $ ] , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent the system quantum state and the field vacuum state , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that the following two conditions must hold in order for the above quantum conditional expectation to be defined : first , @xmath28 is a commutative algebra , and second , @xmath19 is included in the commutant of @xmath28 . but these conditions are actually satisfied as shown above .",
    "consequently , the optimal filter for the system dynamics ( [ qsde ] ) is given by the change in @xmath29 as follows : @xmath30                             \\big[dy_t-\\pi_t(\\hat{c}+\\hat{c}{^{\\dagger}})dt\\big ] .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can further incorporate some control terms into the above equation . typically , a bounded real scalar control input @xmath31 , which should be a function of the observations @xmath32 up to time @xmath15 , is included in the coefficients of the hamiltonian .",
    "we lastly remark that the conditional system state @xmath33 is associated with the system observable by the relation @xmath34 , which leads to the dynamics of @xmath33 termed the stochastic master equation .",
    "a key assumption in the filtering theory is that perfect knowledge about the system dynamics model ( [ qsde ] ) is required in order that the filter ( [ filter - eq ] ) provides the best estimate of the ( controlled ) system observable .",
    "however , this assumption is generally unrealistic , and we depend on only an approximate model of the system .",
    "this not only violates the optimality of the estimation but also possibly leads to the instability of the estimation error dynamics .",
    "this problem is well recognized in the classical filtering theory and various alternative estimators for uncertain systems , which are not necessarily optimal but robust to the uncertainty , have been proposed .",
    "( we use the term  filter \" to refer to only the optimal estimator . ) for example , in a _ risk - sensitive _ control problem in which an exponential - of - integral cost function is minimized with respect to the control input , it is known that the corresponding risk - sensitive observer enjoys enhanced robustness property to a certain type of system uncertainty @xcite .",
    "moreover , by focusing on specific uncertain systems , it is possible to design a _ robust observer _ such that the variance of the estimation error is guaranteed to be within a certain bound for all admissible uncertainties @xcite .",
    "it is considered that the above mentioned robust estimation methods are very useful in the quantum case since it is difficult to specify the exact parameters of a quantum system in any realistic situation : for instance , the total spin number of a spin ensemble @xcite . with this background , james has developed a quantum version of the risk - sensitive observer for both continuous @xcite and discrete cases @xcite and applied it to design an optimal risk - sensitive controller for a single - spin system .",
    "we should remark that , however , the above papers did not provide an example of a physical system such that the quantum risk - sensitive observer is actually more robust than the nominal optimal filter .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we focus on the robust observer and develop its quantum version .",
    "more specifically , we consider a class of quantum linear systems subjected to time - varying norm - bounded parametric uncertainties and obtain a quantum robust observer that guarantees a fixed upper bound on the variance of the estimation error .",
    "although in the linear case much of classical control theory applies to quantum systems , the robust observer obtained in this paper does not have a classical analogue in the following sense .",
    "first , unlike the classical case , the error covariance matrix must be symmetrized because of the noncommutativity of the measured system observables .",
    "second , due to the unitarity of quantum evolution , the uncertainties are included in the system representation in a different and more complicated way than those in the classical system considered previously ; as a result , both the structure of the quantum robust observer and the proof to derive it differ substantially from those found in @xcite .",
    "the other contribution of this paper is that it actually provides a quantum system such that both the robust observer and the risk - sensitive observer show better performance in the estimation error than the nominal optimal filter .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii provides a basic description of general linear quantum systems , in which case the optimal filter ( [ filter - eq ] ) is termed the _",
    "quantum kalman filter_. in addition , we derive a linear risk - sensitive observer . in both cases , an explicit form of the optimal control input is provided . the quantum version of the robust observer is provided in section iii .",
    "section iv discusses robustness properties of the proposed robust observer and the risk - sensitive observer by considering a typical quantum control problem ",
    "feedback cooling of particle motion .",
    "section v concludes the paper .",
    "we use the following notations : for a matrix @xmath35 , the symbols @xmath36 and @xmath37 represent its transpose and elementwise complex conjugate of @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively ; these rules can be applied to any rectangular matrix including column and row vectors .",

    ", the optimal filter for the linear quantum system ( [ linear - qsde ] ) is described by the closed set of equations ( [ linear - filter ] ) and ( [ riccati ] ) , which is termed the quantum kalman filter @xcite .",

    "actually , as @xmath64 evolves deterministically , we can see @xmath72    now , the quantum version of linear quadratic gaussian ( lqg ) control problem is addressed as follows . for the _ linear _ quantum system driven by the quantum _ gaussian _ noise , we aim to find an optimal control input @xmath73 , which is a function of the observations @xmath20 , such that the following _ quadratic _ cost function is minimized : @xmath74=       \\big\\langle         \\int_0^t \\big ( { \\frac{1}{2}}\\hat{x}_t^{{\\mathsf t}}m\\hat{x}^{\\mbox{}}_t                           + \\frac{r}{2}u_t^2 \\big)dt                           + { \\frac{1}{2}}\\hat{x}_t^{{\\mathsf t}}n\\hat{x}_t^{\\mbox { } }         \\big\\rangle.\\ ] ] the positive semidefinite matrices @xmath75 and the scalar number @xmath76 reflect our control strategy ; for example , if we are strongly restricted in the magnitude of the control input , a large value of @xmath77 should be chosen .",
    "this problem can be solved by using the dynamic programming method .",
    "the optimal input is then given by @xmath78 , where the real symmetric matrix @xmath79 is a solution to the following riccati differential equation : @xmath80 thus , we observe that the optimal control input @xmath73 is not a function of the entire observation history up to time @xmath15 , but only depends on the solution to the kalman filter ( [ linear - filter ] ) and ( [ riccati ] ) at time @xmath15 . a controller that satisfies this desirable property",
    "is termed a _ separated controller_. a general discussion on the optimality of the separated control is found in @xcite .",
    "the risk - sensitive control problem was originally formulated by jacobson within the framework of the classical control theory @xcite , and recently its quantum version was developed by james @xcite .",
    "the purpose is to design an optimal control input such that the following cost function is minimized : @xmath81=        \\langle \\hat{r}_t{^{\\dagger}}j_t^{\\mbox{}}({\\rm e}^{\\mu \\hat{\\beta } } )                            \\hat{r}_t^{\\mbox { } } \\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the solution to the operator differential equation @xmath83 and the parameter @xmath84 represents the risk - sensitivity .",

    "therefore , @xmath94 is no longer the optimal estimate of the system observable .",

    "the reason for this is as follows .",
    "first , unlike the classical case , the covariance matrix @xmath64 of the augmented system ( [ augmented ] ) , which is used to express the performance of the robust observer , must be symmetrized in order for @xmath64 to be a physical observable .",
    "second , the uncertainty @xmath109 appears both in the drift matrix @xmath184 and the diffusion matrix @xmath185 in complicated ways ; this is because , as has been previously mentioned , the system matrices are strongly connected with each other due to the unitarity of quantum evolution .",
    "the classical correspondence to the uncertain quantum system ( [ uncertain - qsde ] ) and ( [ uncertain - output ] ) has not been studied . for this reason , the resulting robust observer ( [ robust - filter ] ) and the proof to derive it do not have classical analogues .",
    "actually , for standard classical systems whose system matrices can be specified independently of one another , the process shown in appendix a is unnecessary .",
    "we now present an important property that the quantum robust observer should satisfy : when the uncertainties are small or zero , the robust observer should be close or identical to the optimal quantum kalman filter , respectively .",
    "this natural property is proved as follows . +   + * proposition 2 .",
    "*   consider the case where the uncertainties converge to zero : @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "then , there exist parameters @xmath127 and @xmath128 such that the robust observer ( [ robust - filter ] ) converges to the stationary kalman filter ( [ linear - filter ] ) with @xmath64 satisfying the riccati equation @xmath188 in eq .",
    "( [ riccati ] ) . +   + * proof .",
    "*   let us consider the positive parameters @xmath128 as follows : @xmath189 in this case , for example , the matrix @xmath190 is calculated as @xmath191 which becomes zero as @xmath192 , and @xmath193 .",
    "similarly , in these limits , we have @xmath194 , and @xmath195 .",
    "then , since eq .",
    "( [ riccati1 ] ) is equivalently written as @xmath196 the limit @xmath197 implies that the solution of the above equation satisfies @xmath198 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath199 , and @xmath200 .",
    "therefore , in this case , eq .",
    "( [ riccati2 ] ) with @xmath201 is identical to the riccati equation @xmath188 in eq .",
    "( [ riccati ] ) .",
    "the robust observer ( [ robust - filter ] ) then converges to the stationary kalman filter ( [ linear - filter ] ) with @xmath202 .",
    "@xmath183 +   + the above proposition also states that we can find the parameters @xmath203 and @xmath204 such that the robust observer ( [ robust - filter ] ) approximates the stationary kalman filter when the uncertainties are small , because the solutions of the riccati equations ( [ riccati1 ] ) and ( [ riccati2 ] ) are continuous with respect to the above parameters .",
    "we lastly remark on the controller design . in theorem 1 ,",
    "we have assumed that the control input is a linear function @xmath123 .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption in view of the case of the lqg and risk - sensitive optimal controllers .",
    "hence , it is significant to study the optimization problems of the vector @xmath124 such that some additional specifications are further achieved .",
    "for example , @xmath205 that minimizes the upper bound of the estimation error , @xmath206 , is highly desirable .",
    "however , it is difficult to solve this problem , since the observer dynamics depends on @xmath124 in a rather complicated manner .",
    "therefore , the solution to this problem is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the main purpose of this section is to show that there actually exists an uncertain quantum system such that both the robust observer and the risk - sensitive observer perform more effectively than the kalman filter , which is no longer optimum for uncertain systems .",
    "moreover , we will carry out a detailed comparison of the above three observers by considering each estimation error .",
    "this is certainly significant from a practical viewpoint .",
    "first , let us describe the system .",
    "the control objective is to stabilize the particle position @xmath46 at the origin by continuous monitoring and control . in other words",
    ", we aim to achieve @xmath207 with a small error variance .",
    "the system observable is thus given by @xmath208.\\ ] ] for the hamiltonian part , @xmath209 , we assume the following : the control hamiltonian is proportional to the position operator : @xmath210,\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is the input , and the free hamiltonian is of the form @xmath211 , where @xmath212 denotes the potential energy of the particle . in general , the potential energy can assume a complicated structure .",
    "for example , doherty _",
    "_ @xcite have considered a nonlinear feedback control problem of a particle in a double - well potential @xmath213 . since the present paper deals with only linear quantum systems , we approximate @xmath212 to the second order around the origin and consider a spatially local control of the particle . in particular , we examine the following two approximated free hamiltonians : @xmath214",
    "the former is sometimes referred to as an anti - harmonic oscillator , while the latter is a standard harmonic oscillator approximation .",
    "the system matrices corresponding to @xmath215 are respectively given by @xmath216,~~       g_2=\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc }             0.05 & 0 \\\\             0     & 2 \\\\",
    "\\end{array } \\right].\\ ] ] in the case of the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian , the system is autonomously stable at the origin .",
    "in contrast , in the case of the anti - harmonic oscillator , the system becomes unstable when we do not invoke any control .",
    "however , it is observed that the control hamiltonian ( [ fb - hamiltonian ] ) with an appropriate control input can stabilize the system .",
    "an example is the lqg optimal controller with the following tuning parameters of the cost function ( [ lqg ] ) : @xmath217,~~      r=\\frac{1}{5},~~      n=\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc }           2 & 0 \\\\           0 & 0 \\\\        \\end{array } \\right].\\ ] ] figure i illustrates an estimate of the particle position in both the unstable autonomous trajectory and the controlled stable trajectory ; in the latter case , the control objective @xmath218 is actually satisfied .",
    "an example of the unstable autonomous trajectory ( dot line ) and the controlled stable trajectory ( solid line ) shown by @xmath219 . ]    second , we describe the uncertainty included in the system .",
    "in particular , we consider two situations in which uncertain hamiltonians @xmath220 and @xmath221 are added to @xmath222 and @xmath223 , respectively .",

    ", we assume @xmath227 . in this case , we can set @xmath228 , and @xmath229 by choosing the parameters shown in the proof of proposition 2 .",
    "the comparison of the three observers is performed based on the following evaluation . for the kalman filter and the risk - sensitive observer",
    ", we evaluate the stationary mean square error between the  true \" system and the estimator for the  nominal \" system corresponding to @xmath230 ( see appendix c ) . in both cases , the tuning parameters in the cost function are set to eq .",
    "( [ example - lqg ] ) .",
    "next , for the robust observer , we evaluate the guaranteed upper bound of the estimation error @xmath206 in eq .",

    "the notation ",
    "n / a \" indicates that the solution of the lyapunov equation ( [ appendix - lyapunov ] ) does not satisfy @xmath235 .",
    "this implies that the error dynamics between the uncertain actual system and the nominal kalman filter is unstable . in other words",
    ", the kalman filter fails in the estimation .",
    "it should be noted that two excessively large values of the estimation error , which appear in the first and second rows , indicate that the error dynamics is nearly unstable .",
    "therefore , it can be concluded that the kalman filter and the risk - sensitive observer for the nominal system do not work well when the uncertainty @xmath236 assumes a large .",
    "on the other hand , as shown in the third row in table i , the robust observer is not very sensitive to the magnitude of the uncertainty and provides a good estimation even when @xmath112 is large .",
    "the above discussion suggests that the robust observer is possibly the best option for dealing with a large uncertainty .",
    "in other cases , the risk - sensitive observer should be used .",
    "next , we consider the second example , in which the total system hamiltonian is given by the harmonic oscillator @xmath237 . in this case",
    ", it is immediately observed in table ii that the estimation errors of the robust observer are always greater than those of the others , while the risk - sensitive observer shows a good performance , particularly when @xmath112 assumes a large value .",
    "hence , in this case the risk - sensitive observer is the most appropriate .",
    "an interesting feature of the robust observer is that in the case of both the harmonic and anti - harmonic hamiltonians , it provides almost the same trend in the estimation errors with respect to @xmath112 , whereas the kalman filter and the risk - sensitive observer produce drastically different trends in the errors .",
    "this indicates that the structure of the robust observer is designed such that the estimation error is insensitive to the stability property of the system .",
