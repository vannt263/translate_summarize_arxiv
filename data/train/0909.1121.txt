    "the purpose of the next generation of experiments ( lhc , ilc ) will be to reveal some evidence of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) by detecting some signal of new matter . in particular , some extensions of the sm , new massive and neutral gauge bosons , called @xmath18 , are predicted @xcite .",
    "the detection of a @xmath0 resonance has became in a matter of high priority in particle physics , which could reveal many features about the underlying unified theory .",
    "indirect search for this neutral boson has been carried out at lep , through the mixing with the @xmath19 boson @xcite .",
    "direct @xmath0 production has also been searched at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "the discovery potential for a @xmath0 particle has been explored at the forthcoming large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite in the @xmath20 tev range .",
    "the search for this particle has also been explored in the planned international liner collider ( ilc ) @xcite .",
    "if a @xmath0 signal is detected , further analyses will be neccesary in order to determine all its properties which will allow to test the compatibility of the theoretical models with the experimental data .",
    "on the other hand , the theoretical extensions of the sm with @xmath0 bosons may include more unknown heavy fermions , scalar higgs bosons , or more gauge bosons , which can also be used to constraint extensions of the sm .",
    "for example , the study of the decay modes of new heavy particles would provide additional information on the nature of the extended gauge structure .",
    "in particular , the analyses of new interactions of the @xmath0 boson with the new fermion or higgs content will allow to probe further details about the correct underlying theory .",
    "there are many theoretical models which predict a @xmath0 mass in the tev level , where the most popular are the @xmath21 motivated models @xcite , the left - right symetric model ( lrm ) @xcite , the @xmath0 in little higgs scenario @xcite and the sequential standard model ( ssm ) , which has heavier couplings than those of the sm z boson . searching for @xmath22 in the above models has been widely studied in the literature @xcite and applied at lep2 , tevatron and lhc . on the other hand , the models with gauge symmetry @xmath23 also called 3 - 3 - 1 models @xcite ,",
    "arise as an interesting alternative with @xmath0 boson and many well - established motivations .",
    "first of all , from the cancellation of chiral anomalies @xcite and asymptotic freedom in qcd , the 3 - 3 - 1 models can explain why there are three fermion families .",
    "secondly , since the third family is treated under a different representation , the large mass difference between the heaviest quark family and the two lighter ones may be understood @xcite .",
    "third , the models have a scalar content similar to the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , which allow to predict the quantization of electric charge and the vectorial character of the electromagnetic interactions quantum - charge , vectorlike .",
    "also , these models contain a natural peccei - quinn symmetry , necessary to solve the strong - cp problem pc , pc331 .",
    "finally , the model introduces new types of matter relevant to the next generations of colliders at the tev energy scales , which do not spoil the low energy limits at the electroweak scale .",
    "in particular , the model include new heavy quarks @xmath1 that couple to the @xmath0 boson and new @xmath24 gauge bosons , called @xmath3 , which can provide additional signatures of the 3 - 3 - 1 model .",
    "the effect of the coupling of the new quarks with the @xmath0 boson can lead to two possible scenarios : a. ) if the @xmath0 resonance scale is bigger than the @xmath1 scale , then the @xmath0 decay to @xmath1 quarks would be kinematically allowed .",
    "b. ) if the decay to @xmath1 quarks is not allowed , the quantum radiative corrections through @xmath1 virtual loop effects to the @xmath0 propagator is sensitive to the mass of the @xmath1 quarks . some features of the first scenario",
    "have been explored in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of 3 - 3 - 1 models , where @xmath0 production is searched through fermions and higgs events as final state at lhc . in this work",
    "we will explore the second scenario , where the new heavy quarks could induce important radiative corrections to the @xmath0 decay width , which depend on the couplings and masses of these quarks .",
    "it is to note that the new heavy quarks introduce new physics contributions at low energy , which modify some low energy parameters , as for example the @xmath19-pole observables .",
    "thus , it is also possible to study some features of the new quarks at low energy @xcite .",
    "the studies of quantum corrections have been of high priority to confirm the sm predictions , as for example the precise determination of the top - quark mass @xcite .",
    "since the tree - level phenomenology will not be a definitive test to constraint models , the small quantum corrections will also be an important matter of study in order to distinguish the correct model .",
    "taking into account oblique and vertex corrections through heavy @xmath1 quarks and new heavy @xmath3 gauge bosons , we perform a precision analysis for the 3 - 3 - 1 model , where leading one - loop contributions are considered in the @xmath0 decay width .",
