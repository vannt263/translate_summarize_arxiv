    "primordial black holes ( pbhs ) may have formed during the early universe , and if so can have observational implications at the present epoch , either from effects of their hawking evaporation or from a contribution to the present dark matter density @xcite . that there is no unambiguous observational evidence of pbhs is a significant constraint on some possible types of early universe physics . in particular",
    ", they are the only known way of constraining the density perturbation spectrum on extremely short scales , and indeed until fairly recently provided the most powerful upper limit on the spectral index of perturbations with an exactly power - law power spectrum .    however , the abundance of pbhs formed from a given initial power spectrum remains uncertain .",
    "the traditional calculation takes the same form as the press - schechter calculation much used in large - scale structure studies @xcite , where the density field is smoothed on a mass scale @xmath2 ( in this application taken to be at the time of horizon crossing ) , and those regions where the density contrast exceeds a threshold value @xmath3 are assumed to form pbhs with mass greater than @xmath2 .",
    "however the correct value for the threshold is quite uncertain .",
    "the ` standard ' value of 1/3 for a radiation - dominated universe was derived by carr @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but was probably only ever intended as an order - of - magnitude estimate .",
    "subsequently , niemeyer and jedamzik  @xcite carried out numerical simulations of the collapse of isolated regions and found the threshold for pbh formation , in terms of the relative excess mass within the horizon , to be @xmath4 .",
    "however , shibata and sasaki  @xcite have pointed out that they formulate their initial data after horizon crossing , and hence their criterion can not be related to the initial perturbations produced by , for instance , a period of inflation .",
    "more recently , shibata and sasaki  @xcite devised a new approach to the formation of individual pbhs , seeking to find criteria on the metric perturbation rather than the density field , and in a form which can be applied to superhorizon initial perturbations .",
    "they were able to specify a criterion in terms of whether the initial central value of a particular metric perturbation variable @xmath5 exceeds a threshold value . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the implications of this result for the abundance of pbhs formed .",
    "we briefly describe the pbh formation criterion of shibata and sasaki , whose paper can be consulted for the full details @xcite .",
    "they define a metric variable @xmath5 from the spatial part of the metric on uniform - expansion hypersurfaces [ their eq .",
    "( 2.2 ) ] as g_ij = a^2 ^ 4_ij , where @xmath6 is the metric of the spatial 3-sections ( throughout we assume a flat background and only consider scalar perturbations ) .",
    "shibata and sasaki numerically explored a range of initial configurations , all spherically symmetric , for the metric variable @xmath5 in a radiation - dominated universe , and were able to show that the central value of @xmath5 , denoted @xmath7 , was a good indicator of pbh formation .",
    "they found that pbh formation took place provided @xmath7 exceeded a threshold value @xmath8 .",
    "the precise value of this threshold depended on the environment of the initial configuration , and lay in the range from 1.4 for a density peak surrounded by a low - density region , to 1.8 for a peak surrounded by a flat friedmann  robertson ",
    "walker ( frw ) region .",
    "we wish to relate the shibata ",
    "sasaki threshold criterion to quantities given in standard linear perturbation theory , where the spatial part of the metric tensor is given by  @xcite g_ij = a^2 , where @xmath9 is the curvature perturbation and @xmath10 represents the anisotropic part .",
    "the gauge - invariant curvature perturbation on uniform - density hypersurfaces @xmath11 is defined as  @xcite [ defzeta ] = -h , with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 denoting the hubble parameter , background density , and perturbed density , respectively , which then gives g_ij = a^2 ( 1 + 2)_ij , on superhorizon scales , where the anisotropic part @xmath15 is negligible .",
    "note that on large scales uniform - density hypersurfaces coincide with uniform - expansion hypersurfaces ( also known as uniform - hubble hypersurfaces )  @xcite .",
    "a reasonable prescription for relating @xmath11 and @xmath5 in the quasi - linear regime is [ zetapsi ] = ^4 , since by definition @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the difference in @xmath18-foldings between uniform - expansion hypersurfaces , and we can argue that the uniform - expansion and uniform - density slices are almost equivalent even in the non - linear regime , so that @xmath19 @xcite . using eq .",
    "( [ zetapsi ] ) , we find that the threshold values of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) correspond to thresholds on @xmath11 of @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "the observational constraints on the fraction of the energy density of the universe in pbhs at the time they form , @xmath25 , can be very roughly summarized as _",
    "pbh(m ) 10 ^ -20 , on any interesting mass scale .",
    "detailed examination of particular constraints can give more accurate values for the limits at particular masses  @xcite , but for our present purpose we need only have an approximate guideline . in any event ,",
    "pbh formation calculations remain uncertain enough that high - accuracy observational constraints are unnecessary ; nevertheless the production rate is normally so sensitive to quantities we might wish to constrain , such as the density perturbation amplitude , that useful constraints can be extracted even from quite approximate calculations and constraints .      the traditional pbh abundance calculation ( e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) refers to a quantity which in modern terminology would be known as the density contrast on the comoving ( velocity - orthogonal ) slicing , which we denote by @xmath26 .",
    "the density contrast is smoothed on a scale @xmath27 , and the calculation simply integrates the probability distribution @xmath28 over the range of perturbation sizes which form pbhs : @xmath29 , where the upper limit arises since very large perturbations would correspond to a separate closed universe in the initial conditions  @xcite . in practice",
    "@xmath28 is such a rapidly decreasing function of @xmath30 above @xmath3 that the upper cut - off is not important .",
