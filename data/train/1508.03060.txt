    "there has been increasing interest in developing high efficiency , high power thermoelectric devices , constructed from the bottom - up using nanoscale designs .",
    "the primary applications driving interest in this area are energy - harvesting , the collection and conversion of waste heat to electrical power , produced from sources ranging from hand - held electronics to industrial sources of heat , and refrigeration , actively cooling a spatial region via electrons to evacuate heat out of an area .",
    "the use of nanoscale architecture instead of bulk materials is motivated by the low figure of merit - or poor thermoelectric conversion efficiency - of bulk materials , whereas conduction through nanoscale electronics can reach carnot efficiency .",
    "one way to produce high thermodynamic efficiency in the conversion of heat to power is the use of structures with sharp spectral features , such as quantum dots @xcite .",
    "the use of quantum dots in thermoelectric transport has been extensively researched in the past several years @xcite .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews of these and related activities .",
    "in particular , if the dot is transporting electrons via resonant tunneling , the quantum dot acts as an energy filter - permitting the  tight - coupling \" of heat and charge transport which can lead to carnot efficiency .",
    "other structures from mesoscopic physics , including the quantum point contact and electron cavity @xcite , quantum wells @xcite , quantum hall bar @xcite , superconducting leads @xcite , and coulomb blockaded quantum dots(s ) @xcite have also been investigated for their multi - terminal thermoelectric properties .",
    "the late prof .",
    "markus bttiker , for whom this special issue is in memory of , was highly influential in the theoretical development of these ideas , as can be seen in the above list of references .",
    "several experiments have begun exploring this physics .",
    "et al_. @xcite performed experiments on a cavity connected to resonant tunneling quantum dots acting as an electronic refrigerator , based on the proposal of edwards",
    "_ @xcite . they demonstrated that applying bias to the system results in cooling a large @xmath0 cavity from @xmath1 to below @xmath2 . very recently ,",
    "_ @xcite and f. hartmann _",
    "@xcite showed rectification of electrical current of the nano amp scale and power production on a pico watt scale from a capacitively coupled source of fluctuations .",
    "this was based on the theoretical proposal of sothmann _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "while a nanoscale thermoelectric generator can power nanoscale devices , it is of great interest to find practical ways to scale up these nanoengines .",
    "one way is to simply add them in electrical series while being able to couple to a common source of heat . in commercial thermoelectric generators ,",
    "this is usually done by alternating the semiconductor type , of either p - type or n - type to be able to apply the heat difference in parallel because the heat and electrical transport are in opposite directions in a p - type semiconductor @xcite .",
    "this permits the generated voltage to grow with the number of elements , while keeping the current fixed .",
    "various other ways of scaling the devices have been proposed @xcite . in jordan _ et al .",
    "_ , a layered structure was proposed by alternating layers of semiconductor and self - assembled quantum dots , so as to create a large - scale device where heat and electrical transport are separated , while keeping the high thermodynamic efficiency @xcite .",
    "this is a parallel strategy of scaling , so the generated current grows with the number of dots , while the voltage difference is fixed .",
    "considered a technically simpler method of creating quantum wells that permit resonant tunneling @xcite .",
    "the physics there is somewhat different because energy may be distributed into the transverse degrees of the electron motion .",
    "nevertheless , reasonable thermodynamic efficiency was found , with increased power production .",
    "one of the outstanding challenges to creating high - efficiency thermoelectric devices is phonon transport .",
    "phonons give a way for the hot and cold side of the device to exchange energy directly , without converting it to power via the electrons .",
    "therefore , any possible way to reduce the phonon transport while still allowing electron transport will aid in the overall thermodynamic efficiency .",
    "interface - based devices , such as described above can help with this , because the interface helps to reflect the phonons @xcite .",
    "ideally , there will be additional material layers that act as thermal insulators .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to build on these accomplishments , and make an analysis of a thermoelectric device based on semiconductor super - lattices .",
    "these structures are fabricated by making a periodic layered structure of alternating materials , such as gaas / algaas .",
    "the effect on the electronic transport is to form a series of mini - bands of allowed and forbidden energies where conduction electrons can transport @xcite .",
    "this structure can be considered as a generalization of the resonant tunneling quantum wells .",
    "the mini - band gives a top - hat profile of variable width for the energy - filtering .",
    "such a top - hat profile has been argued by whitney to offer the highest efficiency for a given power extraction @xcite .",
    "however , we note the transverse degrees of freedom make the system somewhat different . at a small band width",
    ", our system will be similar to a quantum well , but can be extended to allow a fixed width longitudinal energy window .",
    "we make a first - principles analysis of the heat and charge transport in a three - terminal geometry , where two terminals carry charge , and a third carries heat ( see fig .  [ fig_gemoetry_energydiagram ] ) .",
    "the offset of the miniband centers and their respective widths determine the power produced and efficiency of the heat conversion given fixed temperature differences .",
    "we next make an analysis of the coefficient of performance of this device for the purposes of refrigeration of the central region .",
    "the final purpose of the present work is to also make a systematic calculation of the heat transport due to phonons .",
    "we make a detailed investigate the heat current through the device from phonon transport using a kronig - penney model , and consider different ways to stop it .",

    "the maximum power arises when one of the two center value stays around twice of @xmath92 and the other center is deep below the equilibrium chemical potential , below about @xmath93 .",

    "we also show the maximum power for the different miniband widths from the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_linear_maxpower ] . as the electrons transport only within the miniband , a wider miniband allows more electrons to transport and generate more power",
    ". however , as the miniband width goes too far above @xmath96 , the power increase stops .",

    "( [ fig_linear_maxpower_asym](c),(d ) ) . as the width increases",

    "the maximal output power of the superlattice heat engine with units @xmath98 is @xmath99 with the efficiency @xmath100 ( for the miniband width , @xmath101 ) , while the quantum well heat engine is @xmath102 with the efficiency @xmath103 . from eq .",
    "( [ gr1]-[gr3 ] ) , we can give a simple reason for this : when the miniband width is suppressed ( longitudinal energy window becomes one value and the electrons transport only with the certain longitudinal energy ) , our results approach the quantum well case .",
    "therefore , a large miniband width permits more electrons to transport in the longitudinal degree of freedom .",
    "while the superlattice engine is more powerful , it is less efficient an energy filter than the quantum well case : this is from the difference between the miniband of the superlattice and the sub - band threshold of the quantum well .",
    "we now turn to an asymmetric system , @xmath104 . to find the optimized combination of the centers of miniband and the asymmetric parameter @xmath54 for the maximum output power , we consider the output power and the efficiency for @xmath105 . fig .",

    "we can understand the reason for this last fact because when the width of the left miniband vanishes , transport from the left is cut off , giving no power , but very good energy filtering , which increases efficiency . to explain other features of the plots , we note that for the right superlattice , the center of miniband stays slightly above the equilibrium chemical potential , and the width of miniband @xmath117 is larger than the width of the distribution function @xmath118 .",
    "consequently , making the miniband wider has no effect on the electron transport because the number of electrons with energies around minimum / maximum of the energy window is exponentially small .",
    "simultaneously , for the smaller miniband of the left barrier , centering it around the energy region where the left reservoir is occupied but the cavity not , gives very good current production .",
    "as the miniband width @xmath92 increases , fig .",
    "( [ fig_linear_maxpower_asym]b ) , @xmath54 moves to a positive value while the center @xmath91 stays around the value that maximizes the power for the symmetric case .",

    "since we are dealing with the heat transfer only to the cross plane direction , the group velocity that we need is only the @xmath10 direction , @xmath186 where we use the one dimensional group velocity @xmath187 .",
    "now , we can write the phonon heat current from the reservoir @xmath28 into the cavity through the superlattice , @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the occupation difference between the reservoir and cavity with the bose - einstein distribution function @xmath190 and @xmath191 represents the transmission function which depends only on the longitudinal momentum @xmath177 . in our analysis , we assume the ballistic case with @xmath192 . when we put the longitudinal group velocity eq.([group_vel ] ) into the first equation of eq .",
    "( [ phonon_heat_current_mom_gen ] ) , we can factorize the heat current to the longitudinal @xmath193 and transverse @xmath194 directions @xmath195 with a modified occupation difference @xmath196 this function gives the effective phonon occupation difference per unit area between the cavity and reservoir due to the transverse momentum",
    ". the transverse momentum of phonons contributes only through the distribution function , and the energy and velocity dependencies of the heat current are only from the longitudinal momentum @xmath177 .",
    "this analysis suggests that the heat current can be treated as a one dimensional calculation with an effective occupation function .",
    "we rewrite the new expression in terms of an integral over longitudinal frequency instead of the momentum space @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the minimum ( maximum ) frequency of the @xmath199 miniband of longitudinal momentum from eq .",
    "( [ characteristic equation ] ) .",
    "the conversion to frequency space introduces the phonon density of state of the superlattice , and we have @xmath200 .",
    "therefore , the group velocity and the density of states cancel out and we have a simple equation of the phonon heat current in eq .",
    "( [ phonon_heat_current_freq ] ) .    when we consider for the electron transport of the superlattice , note that only the lowest miniband was considered , because the energy gap of the first and second miniband is larger than the thermal energy @xmath96 , for the typical materials of the superlattice .",
    "so , when the chemical potentials of the reservoir and the cavity stay around the first miniband , energy window @xmath201 of the occupation will guide the transport only through the first miniband . therefore , it is a reasonable approximation to ignore the higher minibands .",
    "in contrast , the bose - einstein distribution function in the frequency domain is broader than the maximum frequency of the acoustic dispersion , and so all of the acoustic phonons contribute to the heat transport .",
    "the total phonon heat current from the heat engine is also obtained from the heat conservation @xmath202 . however ,",
    "different from the heat current by the electrons , the difference of the phonon heat current through the left / right reservoir is only determined by the temperature difference between the cavity and reservoirs which is contained only in the modified occupation difference @xmath203 .",
    "the temperatures of the left / right reservoir are the same in our case , therefore , the phonon heat current conservation leads to the total phonon heat current such as @xmath204 only if there is symmetric heat conductance .    in order to calculate the effect of the phonons on the thermodynamic efficiency of this engine",
    ", we consider a low temperature regime , where an analytic investigation can be made , followed by a numerical investigation of the high temperature regime .    in the low temperature case",
    ", we assume the temperature only excites low energy modes .",
    "up to a small numerical factor , this permits us to approximate the bose - einstein as a boltzmann distribution , as well as only consider the long wavelength modes , so the dispersion relation may be approximated as , @xmath205 .",
    "computing the effective distribution by integrating over @xmath206 , we find , @xmath207 this allows us to approximate the heat current per unit area from the first mini - band as , @xmath208 \\\\ & \\approx & \\frac{16}{(\\pi a \\hbar \\omega_t)^2 \\hbar }   ( k_b t)^3 \\delta t,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last limit is in the linear response limit .",
    "this is consistent with a debye treatment of the phonon transport .",
    "this result shows that for low temperatures , the phonons freeze out , and the energy is predominately carried by the electrons .    moving on to the high temperature limit , we consider a numerical investigation .",
    "this limit is quite important for room temperature applications in mind .",
    "[ fig_phonon_heatcurrent ] shows the heat currents for gaas / alas superlattices when @xmath127 , as an example .",
    "the phonon heat currents of superlattices and bulk material in panel ( a ) increase with temperature increasing , but saturate at high temperature . moreover , as the superlattice atomic layer increases , the phonon heat current decreases and saturates when the atomic layers are @xmath209 @xcite .",
    "the practical superlattices usually have the atomic layers @xmath209 , so , the practical phonon heat current of the superlattices has about @xmath210 reduction of the heat current from the bulk material around the room temperature .",
    "panel ( b ) compares the electron and phonon heat currents for the optimized parameters to give the maximum output power .",
    "as the temperature increases , the electron heat current increases quadratically while the phonon heat current saturates , so the electron heat current reaches the phonon heat current at high temperature . however , at room temperature , the phonon heat current is still an order of magnitude higher than the electron heat current .",
    "we compare the efficiency by the electron heat current and the total heat current in fig .",
    "[ fig_total_efficiency ] .",
    "the phonon heat current dominates over the electronic one , @xmath211 , when the temperature is around room temperature .",
    "in this situation , we can rewrite the total efficiency @xmath212 the efficiency depends only on the phonon heat current and the generated power .",
    "therefore , we have the maximal efficiency when the power is maximal , and the power and efficiency reach maximal value together . because the phonon heat current is an order of magnitude higher than the electron heat current , the total efficiency decreases about an order of magnitude .",
    "practically , there could be a way to reduce the phonon heat current more than we showed based on the simple theory and example . based on the one dimensional atomic chain model",
    ", we have calculated the phonon heat current in the growth direction and estimated their contributions to the efficiency in the heat engine based on gaas / alas superlattices .",
    "our approach shows that the reduction of the phonon heat current comes from the reduction of the group velocity near the folded brillouin zone edges .",
    "this calculation also assumes the ballistic transport @xmath213 .",
    "however , as the constituent layers become thicker than the phonon mean free path , the phonon transmission function needs to be modified as @xmath214 . in this case",
    ", we also need to treat the phonons as particles and use the theory such as the boltzmann transport equation @xcite .",
    "moreover , other mechanisms such as phonon spectra mismatch and scattering arising from the roughness of the layer interfaces also play an important role to understand the reduction of the experimental results @xcite .",
    "some of high figure of merit thermoelectric materials show reduced lattice thermal conductivity in the superlattice structures , for example si / ge or @xmath215 .",
    "the reduction of phonon heat current can be maximized by the proper choice of superlattice period compared to the mean free path of the phonons : a theory predicts the thermal conductivity minimum as a function of layer spacing @xcite , and some works show the minimum thermal conductivity depending on the superlattice period and a ratio of the layer thickness for the materials @xcite .",
    "therefore , these materials , instead of our example , with optimized superlattice period will give more reduction of phonon heat current of the system .",
    "in this paper , we investigated a heat engine by thermoelectric effects in superlattice structures in three terminal geometry .",
    "first , our work considers the engine as a energy harvester , and shows the advantages of superlattice heat engine in the large output power compared to the other similar geometry due to the box shaped transmission function which comes from the electron energy miniband .",
    "our theory predicts that the maximum power under optimized conditions can be larger than similar resonant tunneling devices , with comparable efficiency at maximum power .",
    "second , a different regime of the system parameters makes the engine works as a refrigerator , and we shows the optimized regime of the parameters for the maximum cooling power and coefficient of performance . in addition , we analyzed the phonon heat current to find the total efficiency by the performance of electrons and phonons together .",
    "the reduction of phonon heat current in the superlattice compared to the corresponding bulk material offers higher total efficiency .",
    "the trade off between power and efficiency is overcome by the reduction of the phonon heat current which can be achieved either by operating at low temperatures , or by engineering the system to have low phonon conductivity , while keeping high electron conductivity .",
    "easy fabrication of these devices with advantages for both the power and efficiency show this heat engine is a promising device for next - generation thermoelectrics .",
