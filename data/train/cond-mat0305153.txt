    "@xcite have developed a method to calculate the arrangement of the magnetization in the fm film and supercurrents including vortices in the sc film in the london s approximation .",
    "the london s approximation is quite good for these mesoscopic systems because characteristic length scales for magnetic field ( the effective penetration depth , the linear size of the textures ) are much larger than the coherence length @xmath3 of the superconductor .",
    "this method was applied recently @xcite to study topological textures in a fm - sc bilayer ( fsb ) .",
    "it was shown that the homogeneous state of the fsb with the magnetization perpendicular to the layer is unstable with respect to the formation of vortices .",
    "the ground state of the fsb represents a periodic array of stripe domains in which the direction of the magnetization in the fm film and the vorticity in the sc film alternate together .    in this article",
    "we study how the combined fm - sc textures change the superconducting transition temperature in bilayers and multilayers . for this purpose",
    "we extend theory of spontaneous sc - fm structures developed in @xcite to the case of multilayers .",
    "we find that spontaneous domain - vortex structures increase the transition temperature , whereas vortex structures induced by a periodic array of magnetic dots decreases the transition temperature .",
    "the magnitude of this effect is large enough to enable its experimental observation .",
    "though the influence of the textures on the transition temperature is akin to the influence of the homogeneous magnetic field , there are important differences between these two phenomena : first , the average magnetic field may be zero for magnetic textures ; second , the reciprocal action of the magnetic field generated by vortices onto magnetization is substantial .",
    "the plan of this article is as follows . in the next section",
    "we consider the change of the transition temperature in the spontaneous stripe structure formed in the fsb . in section 3",
    "we analyze how this stripe structure and the transition temperature change in the presence of an external magnetic field . in section 4",

    "in this section we study the spontaneous stripe system in the fm - sc bilayer in the presence of an external perpendicular magnetic field @xmath47 ( along @xmath7 direction ) .",
    "since the magnetization tends to align along the external magnetic field we anticipate that the width @xmath48 of stripes with the magnetization parallel to the external magnetic field increases , whereas the width @xmath49 of the stripes with the antiparallel magnetization decreases .",

    "thus , the interaction of the superconducting nucleus and the homogeneously magnetized film is zero independently on the wave function of the localized nucleus .",
    "therefore , the transition temperature is the same as in the absence of the ferromagnetic film .",
    "earlier we have found that , without magnetic field the ferromagnetic layer increases the transition temperature and its change may be about 1/10 of initial value .",
    "surprisingly this shift disappears at extremely small external field about 1 - 10 gs .",
    "the reason of this paradox consist of unlimited expansion of domains upon approaching the transition point .",
    "an interesting and counterintuitive result of this consideration is that a very small magnetic field about @xmath2oe is enough to change the transition temperature relatively by 1/10 .",

    "at which the stripes disappear increases proportionally to the number of layers and the shift of the transition temperature grows even faster",
