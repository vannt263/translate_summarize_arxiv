    "most mechanical systems are constantly subject to deformation during their life time . under certain conditions ,",
    "such deformations can profoundly alter the microscopic and macroscopic properties such as , in metallurgy , the strength ( work hardening ) or the ductility ( strain softening ) . understanding the effect of such deformations is clearly of great interest from a practical point of view and , at the same time , poses many fundamental questions  @xcite . among different systems",
    ", amorphous materials are particularly challenging from a conceptual point of view , due to the lack of microscopic long - range order  @xcite .",
    "they are , however , very suitable for many practical applications and arise in many context in nature .",
    "a prominent example is the case of metallic glasses , which are disordered solids that are obtained by fast cooling metallic alloys that have been especially designed to avoid crystallization and remain amorphous  @xcite .",
    "other widely studied examples , in addition to the most familiar class of molecular and polymeric glass formers , are colloidal suspensions  @xcite , foams  @xcite , granular packings  @xcite and biological assemblies such as the cytoskeleton  @xcite .",
    "insight into the behavior of glass formers can be obtained by a computational investigation of their energy landscape  @xcite .",
    "the same idea can be applied to mechanical deformation of glasses . in this case , the evolution of the local energy minima , or _ inherent structures _ , of the model glass , can be followed using a protocol referred to as _ athermal quasi - static ( aqs ) _ deformation @xcite .",
    "it has been shown , for example , that systems tend to visit energy basins with energies typical of high temperature @xcite under shear deformation up to large strains , while under a finite amplitude cycle of back and forth deformation , both rejuvenation ( increase in the inherent structure energy ) and over - aging ( decrease in the energy ) effects can be observed @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that very rich and interesting behavior arises when a model glass is subjected to repeated cyclic deformations at zero temperature , i.e. following the aqs protocol . for a model binary mixture glass with particles interacting with the lennard - jones potential  @xcite",
    ", we have shown that as the amplitude of the oscillations increases , the system undergoes a transition from a quiescent or localized regime to a diffusive regime . in the former , after a short transient , the system remains localized in the same energy minimum at the end of each cycle , while in the latter state it diffuses in configuration space  @xcite .",
    "this transition from localization to diffusion occurs at a critical amplitude @xmath1 , as has also been reported by other authors on similar systems  @xcite , in recent experiments  @xcite as well in other theoretical and computational works  @xcite . as discussed in  @xcite ,",
    "the transition observed at @xmath1 can be identified with the yielding transition under steady strain , where irreversible behavior sets in .",
    "this transition resembles strongly the dynamical transition from a reversible to an irreversible state that has been found in dilute non - brownian colloidal particle suspensions @xcite and granular systems  @xcite , but the similarities and differences in the yielding behavior of these systems merits further investigation . in that case , however , the reversible states , analogous to our localized states , are a consequence of the intrinsic reversibility of the low - reynolds number hydrodynamics and they disappear above a certain critical threshold when the interactions between the particles sets in .",
    "+ the existence of reversible or localized states , that remain unchanged under the effect of oscillatory deformation , implies that the system remains indefinitely in a given state that corresponds to the amplitude of the oscillatory deformation imposed . in principle",
    ", this property can be used to encode memory that can be read at a later stage .",
    "keim an nagel have used a computational model , first introduced in @xcite , to demonstrate that such a memory encoding is possible for a model of dilute colloidal particles  @xcite . in the case of localized states ,",
    "the system retains memory of the value of the amplitude that has been used during the training phase and this value can be read by analyzing the displacement during a deformation cycle , i.e. the reading phase .",
    "we have shown that surprisingly analogous behavior can be observed for a model atomic glass @xcite , though with important differences .",
    "glasses possess a complex energy landscape and even when the microscopic configuration remains invariant at the end of a full cycle of deformation , the system may move through a complex periodic orbit of energy minima during the cycle .",
    "in addition , by alternating strain cycles of different amplitudes , multiple memories of such amplitudes can be encoded .",
    "such a possibility exists also in the model colloidal suspension but in that case the ability to encode multiple memories is transient  @xcite , and is observed when the system is not in the fully trained , stationary , regime , and requires the addition of noise to be made persistent for a large number of training cycles . understanding the reasons why these ( and other ) significantly different systems exhibit very similar memory effects , and the nature of the universalities and differences is an interesting subject for further investigations . in this paper , we describe results concerning two simple , schematic models , which have been investigated to elucidate the characteristics and mechanisms of the non - equilibrium transition and memory effects described above .",
    "these simplified models are investigated in order to understand what are the fundamental mechanisms that can originate the phenomenology that has been observed for the lj system .",
    "the first is a lattice model , the _ nk _ model , that we have already briefly discussed earlier in the context of memory effects  @xcite .",
    "the nk model is a spin model with multi - spin interactions that is designed to generate energy landscapes with tunable roughness , and also to mimic the effects of imposing shear deformation .",
    "the second model , the _ transition matrix _ ( tm ) model , aims to capture key aspects of the changes induced by cyclic shear deformation by specifying rules to construct a transition matrix that maps the set of local energy minima onto itself as a result of a single cycle . studying the evolution of the set of occupied local energy minima as a function of the number of cycles allows us , in principle , to understand what are the key features of the transition matrix that determines the observed behavior .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in and we introduce the two models that are the main subject of this paper . in we discuss the results that concern the existence of a dynamical transition while in we discuss memory effects . finally , we summarize our results and conclusions in .",
    "the nk model is defined on a set of spins interacting according to a hamiltonian that incorporates a parameter @xmath2 that mimics the effect of shear strain .",
    "it was studied by isner and lacks @xcite as an analog system to the model atomic glass former in which overaging and rejuvenation were observed @xcite under a single deformation semicycle .",
    "we consider @xmath3 ( even ) lattice sites occupied by spins @xmath4 that can take either the values @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 furthermore , in order to prevent the system getting trapped around low energy configurations with aligned spins , we limit the space of allowed configurations to those that satisfy the constraint @xmath8 ( this is equivalent to taking the set of states of constant magnetization @xmath5 in the ising model ) .",
    "there are @xmath9 such configurations , and we define two nk configurations as adjacent if one is turned into the other by swapping the values at two sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 such that @xmath12 . since one may choose one of @xmath13 spins with @xmath14 for swapping with any one of @xmath13 spins with @xmath15 , each configuration has @xmath16 configurations that are adjacent to it .",
    "we introduce :    * an ordered list of @xmath17 `` neighbors '' for each @xmath10-th spin , specified by the map @xmath18 : @xmath19 the choice of the list of neighbors for a given spin is random .",
    "* two functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 connecting the set @xmath22 ( the set of all the @xmath23-tuples formed by ones and zeros ) to the intervals @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 $ ] respectively @xmath26   & \\quad         \\{0 , 1\\}^{k+1 } & \\xrightarrow{b } [ 0,1 ]          \\label{eq : nkcouplings }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the correspondence between a given @xmath23-tuple and the numerical value is chosen randomly with a uniform probability within the respective intervals .",
    "the energy of the system depends on the values of the spins , @xmath27 according to @xmath28      \\label{eq : nkenergy}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 ( which we will name , with an abuse of language , `` shear strain '' ) is a parameter that can be varied continuously .",
    "the nk model is known to possess a discrete energy landscape whose roughness ( a measure of which is given by the number of local minima in the landscape ) is tuned by the value of the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "the landscape is smooth for @xmath29 and the roughness is increased as @xmath17 is increased . to see this",
    "consider the case @xmath30 for simplicity . if @xmath31 , when performing the sum in one sums contributions that are simply @xmath32 , where @xmath33 can assume only two values in the interval @xmath24 $ ] , depending solely on whether @xmath34 or @xmath5 , as no spin has neighbors .",
    "it is clear that the energy increases or decreases monotonically with the `` magnetization '' , @xmath35 . as in our case such quantity",
    "is fixed , all the allowed configurations have the same @xmath36 .",
    "this implies that by moving from a given configuration to any adjacent one the energy ca nt change and the landscape is thus _",
    "flat_. in the case @xmath37 each spin is a neighbor of any other . to estimate the roughness of the landscape",
    ", we compare the energies of two adjacent structures , that differ by the swapping of two spins .",
    "each term in is affected by such a swap , and so all the @xmath33 s that contribute to the energy of the two configurations differ",
    ". since the @xmath33 s are random and uncorrelated , there wo nt be correlation between the energies of two adjacent configurations .",
    "consequently , the structure of the overall landscape will be rough .    while @xmath17 is able to tune the roughness of the landscape , the parameter @xmath2 is able to change continuously the values of the energy of the configurations ( and thus the overall landscape ) .",
    "this is similar to what happens in a glass , in which a macroscopic strain is externally imposed .",
    "the broad features of the nk model are thus similar to the atomic glass formers mentioned earlier , with the significant difference that the configuration space of the nk model is discrete .",
    "we next describe how procedures such as energy minimization and aqs are performed in the nk model . starting from an initial configuration",
    ", energy can be minimized by a steepest descent ( sd ) procedure .",
    "a sd in the nk energy landscape consists of moving from a configuration to the adjacent one with the lowest @xmath36 , and iterating this procedure until when no move to an adjacent configuration results in a decrease in @xmath36 .",
    "using such a protocol , any configuration can be mapped onto a local minimum , _",
    "i.e. _ an inherent structure of the nk landscape .",
    "this fact , together with the dependence on @xmath2 of the landscape , allows us to define an athermal quasi static `` deformation '' procedure on nk systems too :    1 .",
    "take an inherent structure of the nk landscape .",
    "this can be obtained by any configuration by means of the sd algorithm .",
    "2 .   increment the value of @xmath2 in by a small amount @xmath38 .",
    "the value of @xmath38 should be small enough so that the modification of the landscape is slow enough and no displacements to adjacent inherent structures are `` missed '' should be small enough that if a smaller @xmath39 was employed it would yield exactly the same evolution .",
    "] by the aqs dynamics . 3 .",
    "apply the sd procedure to the configuration .",
    "as aqs can be applied to the nk model , it is interesting to check whether the same phenomenology seen in aqs deformation of model atomic glass formers can be observed in it .",
    "however , one should bear in mind the following differences between the nk model and atomic glass formers :    * since the nk model has a _ discrete _ configuration space , the aqs dynamics of nk systems is somewhat different to that of atomic systems under the aqs protocol . in the nk case ,",
    "the system occupies one given point of the available configuration space as @xmath2 is changed , and stays there until it `` jumps '' to another inherent stucture configuration as soon as the initial configuration is not an inherent structure anymore . in the atomic systems , instead , the configuration of the system _ continuously changes _ as @xmath2 is varied . * due to the discrete nature of the landscape , minimization is trickier in the nk case . while for atomic glass formers _",
    "local _ quantities ( e.g. the calculation of a potential energy gradient ) allow the determination of directions to follow to reach an inherent structure , in the nk model _ all _ the energies of adjacent configurations need to be calculated in order to choose the adjacent configuration with the lowest energy ( if there is one ) .",
    "this operation requires @xmath40 energy calculations to be performed ( as the number of adjacent configurations scales with @xmath41 , see above ) and it is thus computationally infeasible for large values of @xmath3 . *",
    "while for atomic glass formers , the energy landscapes depend on the few parameters defining the interaction potential ( _ e .",
    "g. _ the values of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 parameters for the lennard - jones potential ) and the boundary conditions of the simulation volume , the definition of the landscape in the nk case requires the introduction of a much larger number of parameters .",
    "this is because the lists of neighbors specified by @xmath18 can be realized in many different ways and @xmath20 and @xmath21 in and require @xmath44 values each to be defined .",
    "having noted this , we can study the nk model under athermal quasi - static deformation , and compare the results with what is obtained with the model atomic glass former studied in @xcite ( the kob - andersen binary mixture with lennard - jones interactions  @xcite , or lj ) .",
    "such comparison is meaningful , because the two systems share important features . at the same time it is not trivial , becuase , as explained above",
    ", the two models are `` sufficiently different '' that common qualitative behavior can not be taken for granted _ a priori_.    , @xmath45 ) equilibrated at different @xmath46.[fig : inherentuvstnk],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    before performing simulations of `` deformation '' on nk samples one needs initial configurations . as in the case of the lj systems discussed in @xcite",
    ", one would like to start from sets of configurations that differ for some feature ( like the average potential energy ) . in this way",
    "one can check how deformation affects the samples , and how it is capable of making them evolve in such a way to forget their initial state .",
    "the obvious choice is to choose inherent structures corresponding to different temperatures @xmath46 , as we did in our previous study of the lj case .",
    "we thus obtain several equilibrated nk configurations at different @xmath46 .",
    "we do this for several realizations of the couplings @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath18 by means of monte carlo sampling and find the inherent structures at each temperature @xmath46 by means of steepest descent ( sd ) minimization .",
    "the average energy of such inherent structures is plotted in , showing a behavior similar to that observed in @xcite for a model atomic glass former .",
    "we choose temperatures ( measured in units of @xmath47 ) @xmath48 and @xmath49 for further analysis , as they are different enough to be distinguished .",
    "these temperatures are above the glass temperature of the models which is estimated to be around 0.45  @xcite .",
    "both the lj and nk models possess a rugged landscape that is modified during the deformation .",
    "the behavior under oscillatory deformation , in particular , thus depends on the detailed features of the landscape .",
    "would it be possible to predict the behavior of such models qualitatively , without encoding in detail the features of the energy landscape , but using a sort of `` high - level '' , abstract description of its evolution ?",
    "this is what the `` transition matrix '' method ( tm ) aims to do .",
    "the starting point of the tm approach is to look at a cycle of aqs deformation from a mere `` mathematical '' point of view . in that perspective",
    ", an aqs cycle is a correspondence between the set of @xmath50 inherent structures of the energy landscape at @xmath30 into itself .",
    "this is because a valid starting configuration is an inherent structure of the @xmath30 landscape , and it is transformed into another inherent structure of the same landscape at the end of the deformation cycle .",
    "each of these inherent structures can be identified by an index @xmath10 , and associated to a @xmath50-dimensional vector @xmath51 whose components are all zero but for the @xmath10-th one , which is set equal to 1 .",
    "then , they can be taken as starting points of a deformation experiment where a single aqs cycle is performed and the inherent structure reached at the end is recorded .    this allows to define a _ transition matrix _ @xmath52 , such that @xmath53 where @xmath51 and @xmath54 are the vectors associated to the initial and final inherent states .",
    "here we list some of the properties of the @xmath52 matrix , which derive directly from the features of aqs dynamics :    * @xmath52 encodes the entire information about the evolution of any inherent structure under cyclic deformation , as by using one can determine the final inherent structure @xmath54 given any intial one @xmath51 .",
    "* @xmath52 is a sparse @xmath55 matrix , and @xmath56 if and only if the state associated to @xmath57 is mapped onto the inherent structure @xmath51 in the aqs cycle .",
    "the consequence is that all the columns have exactly one non - zero entry ( equal to one ) because each @xmath57 configuration is sent to some other @xmath51 inherent structure by the aqs cycle .",
    "* @xmath52 depends on the value of @xmath58 , i.e. on the amplitude of the deformation .",
    "for very small amplitudes , a sizable fraction of the inherent structures will be unchanged under the deformation , because an aqs cycle will not be effective at destabilizing the starting inherent structures . in this case",
    "a given structure will often map onto itself through @xmath52 and thus @xmath52 will be very close to the diagonal unit matrix . in general this",
    "wo nt be any longer true for higher values of @xmath58 .",
    "* the determinant of @xmath52 is , in general , zero .",
    "in general , more than one structure will map onto the same final state @xmath54 , so that in that case @xmath52 will define a non - injective function .",
    "as the domain of @xmath52 is also its codomain , @xmath52 is not surjective , so that there will be structures that are not arrival configurations for any inherent structure ( this is illustrated in ) .",
    "this has the consequence that some rows of the @xmath52 matrix , in general , are identically zero , and so is the value of @xmath59 .",
    "+   landscape onto itself.[fig : aqscycleasmap],scaledwidth=50.0% ] * @xmath50 , in general , is a large number .",
    "the size of @xmath52 is equal to the number of inherent structures of the landscape , and this number , for typical lj and nk landscapes , is large ( exponential in @xmath3 in the first case , and equal to @xmath9 in the second ) . *",
    "the result of a deformation experiment where @xmath60 cycles ( rather than just one ) are applied to a given starting configuration @xmath51 is obtained by applying repeatedly : @xmath61      a given configuration @xmath51 can transform under the effect of @xmath52 in different ways :    1 .",
    "[ it : absorbingstate ] @xmath62 : in this case @xmath52 has no effect on @xmath51 , so that @xmath51 is an eigenvector of @xmath52 relative to the eigenvalue 1 , and @xmath63 .",

    "we name such a @xmath70 as _ mapping to recurring state_.    note that _ every _ configuration falls in one of the categories enumerated above .",
    "this can be demostrated",
    "as follows : suppose that a configuration @xmath73 exists that does nt fall in any of the categories listed above .",
    "if @xmath52 is applied to it , then some other configuration @xmath74 is obtained , else @xmath73 would belong to the category in .",
    "repeated application of @xmath52 yields always new states @xmath75 , so that no absorbing nor recurring states are encountered , else @xmath73 would belong to one of the categories in , or .",
    "after @xmath50 applications of @xmath52 , a sequence of @xmath76 distinct inherent configurations has been generated , but only @xmath50 distinct inherent structures exist !",
    "so the initial hypothesis ( the very existence of @xmath73 ) ca nt be true .",
    "we note that in principle , recurring states with periods that are of ( 1 ) are qualitatively different from and should be distinguished from those with are of ( m ) , although we do not attempt such analysis here .    what is the correspondence between this classification of states and the absorbing and the diffusive states encountered in @xcite ? absorbing states of the lj model clearly correspond to the absorbing states of the tm model . diffusing states in the lj model",
    "correspond to a subset of the recurring states of the tm picture with periods which are large , or more precisely , exponential in the number of particles in the system .",
    "in fact , even though a diffusing lj system does not seem to revisit the same inherent structure as it travels in configuration space , after a large number of oscillation cycles it _ has to _ , as the number of possible inherent structures is finite .",
    "thus the diffusing states of can be viewed as recurring states , which just take a _ very _ large number of cycles to come back to their starting state .",
    "nevertheless , a more sophisticated analysis than we attempt here should distinguish between diffusing states and recurring states with ( 1 ) period cycles .",
    "tells that the @xmath52 matrix contains the entire information about the outcome of oscillatory aqs deformation , but how can one construct it ?",
    "computing it for lj or nk systems can in principle be done by brute force : one needs to have a list of the inherent structures , use each of them as a starting configuration for a shear deformation cycle and see which structures they eventually reach at the end of the cycle .",
    "this idea is easier to apply for the nk model than in the lj case : in the former one can ( at least in principle ) enumerate all the @xmath9 allowed configurations , minimize each and every one of them so to get all the inherent structures of the landscape ; in the latter , which has a continuous energy landscape and a continuous set of configurations , the determination of the local minima of the landscape is a less trivial task is very expensive computationally , as @xmath9 minimizations need to be performed at every aqs step . ] .",
    "the infeasibility of a brute force approach is the reason why one would like to construct @xmath52 by less expensive means , albeit in an approximate or schematic way .",
    "to do so , we make a series of observations and assumptions about the evolution of the energy landscape , that allow to construct @xmath52 .",
    "the transition matrices that we construct are based on some assumptions on the dynamics of inherent structures in the course of a deformation cycle :    1 .   during the deformation ( at non - zero values of @xmath2 ) the number of energy minima",
    "is assumed to be _ always _ equal to @xmath50 , no matter the value of @xmath2 . the number of local minima present in the landscapes of lj and nk models will , in general , weakly in a simulation that employs lees - edwards conditions , but the _ statistical _ properties of the system ( like the value of @xmath50 ) will not vary much with it . ]",
    "depend on the value of @xmath2 .",
    "2 .   minima are destabilized by changing @xmath2 , _",
    "i.e. _ that some of them are destroyed by the deformation .",
    "as the number of structures is assumed to be conserved ( see above ) to each inherent structure destruction corresponds the creation of a new one .",
    "the probability per unit strain of an inherent structure to be destabilized is assumed to be the same for all the @xmath50 structures and equal to a value @xmath77 independent of @xmath2 .",
    "a system resides in a given inherent structure until such inherent structure is destabilized .",
    "when this happens , the system jumps to another inherent structure of the deformed landscape .",
    "for simplicity such a structure is assumed to be picked at random in the landscape ( whereas , in a realization of the nk or lj models , a system will land on a structure which is not far from the starting one in the space of configurations ) .",
    "in addition , the model relies on two facts that are true in general :    1 .   as a deformation _ _ semi__cycle brings the system from 0 up to @xmath58 and then back to the undeformed landscape , there is a _",
    "symmetry _ in the structures that are created and destroyed as @xmath2 is incremented from @xmath5 to @xmath58 and those that are created / destroyed as @xmath2 is reduced back to 0 in the second part of the semicycle .",
    "in fact , if a structure @xmath78 is destroyed when incrementing @xmath2 above some value @xmath79 , the same structure @xmath78 will be created at @xmath79 as the deformation is reversed .",
    "the converse is true for a structure @xmath80 that is created in the first half of the semicycle .",
    "the matrix @xmath52 can be viewed as the product of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the matrices that describe the two semicycles ( one denoted by positive , the other by negative strain @xmath2 ) that form a full oscillation cycle .",
    "a description of how these assumptions and observations are combined to calculate an approximation of the @xmath52 matrix is presented in appendix [ append ] .    , for different initial effective temperatures and different deformation amplitudes @xmath58 , setting @xmath83 , @xmath45 .",
    "data refer to configurations with @xmath30 . for large values of @xmath58",
    "the energy fluctuates around some value which depends on @xmath58 only . at small @xmath58 , instead , the plateau value of the energy depends on the effective @xmath46 of the initial configuration . in this respect",
    "what is observed here qualitatively resembles what has been found in the atomistic glass model in @xcite .",
    "[ fig : uvsaccumulatedstrainnk],scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we consider @xmath84 and @xmath45 , and @xmath85 instances of the couplings and obtain 3 - 4 equilibrated configurations at @xmath48 and @xmath49 for each of such instances .",
    "the corresponding inherent structures obtained by sd are deformed by increasing @xmath2 in in steps of @xmath86 ( for all @xmath3 ) and performing sd at each step .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 is varied in the interval @xmath87 $ ] in a triangle wave fashion , exactly as in the aqs simulations seen in ref .  .",
    "the values of @xmath36 and the configuration are recorded whenever @xmath30 , i.e. at intervals of @xmath88 .",
    "plots of @xmath36 as a function of the accumulated strain @xmath89 are shown in for the @xmath90 case .",
    "similarly to what is observed in the lj case , for small values of @xmath58 the energy reaches a plateau which depends on _ both _ @xmath58 and the initial effective @xmath46 . for higher values of @xmath58 , all samples , regardless their initial effective @xmath46 , reach plateau depending on @xmath58 only . in this respect ,",
    "the nk model is able to reproduce qualitatively the same behavior found in lj systems  @xcite , where samples forget about their initial preparation if the oscillation amplitude exceeds some value @xmath91 .",
    "+   + changes in configurations under deformation can be studied for nk configuration as well , by looking at the distance between configurations before and after the application of deformation cycles .",
    "consider two configurations , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , obtained for values of the accumulated strain equal to @xmath94 and @xmath89 respectively , with @xmath95 .",
    "their distance can be expressed using the hamming definition is the fraction of disagreeing components of the two vectors @xmath96 and @xmath97 . ] @xmath98 : @xmath99 where @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) is the number of occurrences such that the @xmath10-th component of @xmath92 and the @xmath10-th component of @xmath93 are respectively equal to 0 and 1 ( to 1 and 0 ) .",
    "we thus pick a configuration @xmath96 , choosing a large enough @xmath94 so that the corresponding @xmath36 in has relaxed to a steady state .",
    "we then compute the hamming distance from it for configurations reached for increasing values of @xmath89 , and plot it in .",
    "the average hamming distance measured starting from a reference configuration in the steady state quickly reaches a constant value for increasing @xmath89 , rather than show a linear increase with time as the mean squared displacement does for the atomic glass former @xcite .",
    "however , the hamming distance , like the overlap  @xcite or dissimilarity  @xcite used in the context of atomic liquids , is a bounded quantity and should be treated as a correlation function rather than a measure of mobility . in the present case ,",
    "given the constraint on the total magnetization , the hamming distance has an average value of @xmath102 for uncorrelated configurations .",
    "thus , the value of the hamming distance itself serves as a metric of localization of the configurations under shear .    by plotting the average hamming distance as a function of @xmath58 for different values of @xmath3 ( see ) , one observes that the capability of the system to move away from the reference configuration increases sharply at some value @xmath91 , which is roughly @xmath3 independent .",
    "the sharpness of the transition , moreover , is seen to increase with @xmath3 .",
    "these data thus seem to confirm that a transition at some oscillation amplitude @xmath91 from a localized regime to a diffusive one exists in the nk model , similarly to what is observed in our lj systems in ref .   and models of particle suspensions studied in @xcite .",

    "+ in conclusion , the nk and tm models are interesting for two main reasons .",
    "firstly , they clarify what are the essential model features behind the dynamical transition observed in the lj model .",
    "the nk model , for example , proves that a continuous configuration space and energy landscape is not necessarily required .",
    "the tm model goes even further and shows that the observed phenomena occur when the transition matrix is constructed following a simple set of rules .",
    "having found that such a set of basic ingredients exist , one can imagine that analogous dynamic and memory effects could be observed in a wide class of systems , such as spin models or soft matter materials .",
    "secondly , these simplified models could be the base of more fundamental approaches to treat the athermal deformation of physical system , in which the dynamics is deterministic .",
    "the tm model , for example , could lay down the basis for a new framework to model oscillatory deformation in materials .",
    "+ the two models that we have described here make some fundamental simplifications on the properties of the pel .",
    "the tm model assumes that the states visited during deformation are completely uncorrelated ( as there is no notion of space or distance in the tm model ) , while the nk introduces a pel of controlled roughness but with no structural information , as it is generated from a series of random couplings .",
    "this is fundamentally different from the full ka model that presents a pel that is the result of a two - body interaction potential between its constituents .",
    "a present limitation of the tm model , however , is that it does nt incorporate any organization between the different inherent states .",
    "this is clearly not the case for the lj systems , whose pel has a complex structure and spatially correlated particle motion between adjacent inherent structures is expected under deformation . in the future , it would be interesting to see if some degree of correlation can be included in this model .",
    "another interesting question for future work is the identification of precise conditions for persistent memory as seen in the nk and tm models , as opposed to transient memory seen in other model systems @xcite .",

    ", @xmath155 is a square matrix . to construct each of the @xmath149 one uses the assumption that the probability per unit strain to destabilize",
    "a given inherent structure is equal to @xmath77 .",
    "so , when the strain is incremented by @xmath38 , a system in a given inherent structure has probability @xmath157 to be in a structure @xmath10 that is not destabilized , and thus it maps to the same structure @xmath158 in the deformed landscape through @xmath149 . in that case",
