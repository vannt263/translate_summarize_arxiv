    "( 2003b ) were able to improve the results of both codes by tuning the photometry .",

    "we also applied a @xmath112 threshold to eliminate saturated sources .",

    "the photometric redshift method fails for many of them , but broad - line agns are straightforward to identify spectroscopically , even in the redshift range @xmath113 , and we now have observed the bulk of the sources in the cdf - n x - ray sample ( see figure  [ fig3]b ) , so we do not need to worry that broad - line agns will contaminate our photometric redshift sample .",
    "the photometric redshifts for the non - broad - line sources are clearly quite robust , with 94% having photometric redshifts within 25% ( _ horizontal dashed lines _ ) of their spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "only one very low redshift source has a badly discrepant photometric redshift ( spectroscopic redshift of @xmath114 and photometric redshift of 2.58 ) and hence is not within the vertical range of the plot .",
    "we have not attempted to refine the photometric redshifts with spectral information ( e.g. , there may be cases where we had insufficient spectral information to reliably identify the source spectroscopically but that information could have been used to try to improve the photometric redshifts ) , since for most purposes the photometric redshifts are accurate enough .",
    "the bpz photometric redshifts presented in this paper are an improvement over the photometric redshift estimates made with hyperz for the 1  ms cdf - n x - ray sources ( barger et al .",
    "in figure  [ fig5 ] we show redshift versus hard x - ray flux for the spectroscopically ( _ solid squares _ ) and photometrically ( _ open triangles _ ) identified cdf - n hard x - ray sources .",
    "to avoid incompleteness at the faint end when determining the fractional light contribution from each redshift interval to the measured hard x - ray light , we consider two restricted uniform flux - limited hard x - ray subsamples , which we refer to as our `` bright '' and `` deep '' subsamples . for the bright subsample we consider a @xmath16 radius region around the approximate center of the x - ray image and select sources detected with fluxes above @xmath115  ergs  @xmath37  s@xmath3 .

    "<S> we present an optical and near - infrared catalog for the x - ray sources in the @xmath0  ms _ chandra _ observation of the hubble deep field - north region . </S>",
    "<S> we have high - quality multicolor imaging data for all 503 x - ray point sources in the x - ray - selected catalog and reliable spectroscopic redshifts for 284 . </S>",
    "<S> we spectroscopically identify six high - redshift ( @xmath1 ) type  ii quasars ( @xmath2  ergs  s@xmath3 ) in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> our spectroscopic completeness for the @xmath4 sources is 87% . </S>",
    "<S> the spectroscopic redshift distribution shows two broad redshift spikes that have clearly grown over those originally seen in the @xmath5  ms exposure . </S>",
    "<S> the spectroscopically identified extragalactic sources already comprise 75% of the measured @xmath6  kev light . </S>",
    "<S> redshift slices versus @xmath6  kev flux show that an impressive 54% of the measured @xmath6  kev light arises from sources at @xmath7 and 68% from sources at @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , major accretion onto supermassive black holes has occurred since the universe was half its present age .    </S>",
    "<S> we use seven broadband colors and a bayesian photometric redshift estimation code to obtain photometric redshifts for the x - ray sources . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the photometric redshifts are within 25% of the spectroscopic redshifts for 94% of the non - broad - line sources with both photometric and spectroscopic measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the photometrically identified sources show a smooth continuation of the spectroscopically identified sources to redder @xmath9 color with increasing redshift , consistent with the galaxy tracks of evolved bulge - dominated galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> fourteen have colors @xmath10 that would classify them as extremely red objects ( eros ) . </S>",
    "<S> the photometric redshifts of these eros are all between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> we use our wide wavelength coverage to determine rest - frame colors for the x - ray sources with spectroscopic or photometric redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> we find that many of the x - ray sources have the rest - frame colors of evolved red galaxies and that there is very little evolution in these colors with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we also determine absolute magnitudes and find that many of the non - broad - line sources are more luminous than @xmath13 , even at high redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore infer that deep x - ray observations may provide an effective way of locating @xmath14 galaxies with colors similar to present - day early - type galaxies to high redshifts . </S>"
