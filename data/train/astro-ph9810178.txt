    "the radio spectrum has a power - law shape which is typical of an optically thin synchrotron emitting radio source ( e.g. pacholczyk 1970 ) .",
    "the turn - over of the radio spectrum at low frequencies can be due to synchrotron self absorption ( ssa ) in high density parts of a compact radio source ( e.g. scott & readhead 1977 ) , free - free absorption in a sheet of clouds surrounding the radio source ( bicknell , dopita & odea 1997 ) or ionized clouds within it ( begelman 1998 ) .",
    "+ vlbi observations ( e.g. dallacasa et al .",
    "1995 , stanghellini et al .",
    "1997 , snellen 1997 ) show that gps sources are compact radio sources with linear sizes up to a few hundred pc and often with a symmetrical double radio structure ( compact symmetric objects , cso , e.g. wilkinson et al .",
    "1994 , readhead et al .",
    "there are two popular scenarios to explain the origin of gps sources .",
    "the first is that gps sources are very young radio sources , that have just started to develop their radio lobes ( phillips & mutel 1982 ) .",
    "they are expected eventually to grow into large double - lobed radio sources , perhaps even into the mpc - sized giant radio galaxies ( grgs ) . because small radio sources are much more numerous than large radio sources , strong negative luminosity evolution as they increase in size is required ( e.g. fanti et al .",
    "1995 , readhead et al .",
    "1996 , odea & baum 1997 ) .",
    "reynolds & begelman ( 1997 ) propose that this can be achieved by intermittency of the jet - production in the agn on timescales of @xmath16 yr .",
    "+ the second scenario explains gps sources as radio sources which are confined by a high density ism ( ` frustrated ' radio sources , e.g. van breugel et al .",
    "1984 , odea et al . 1991 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the jet is not able to escape the dense surrounding material within its lifetime , either because it is repeatedly reflected off dense clouds or because the ram - pressure of the surrounding medium is high enough to practically stall the progress of the head of the jet .",
    "the radio source is therefore confined to a small central region .",
    "+ roughly 10% of known gps sources show extended ( kpc - scale ) radio emission ( baum et al .",
    "1990 , stanghellini et al .",
    "1990 , odea 1998 ) .",
    "baum et al . ( 1990 ) propose that the gps source in these sources may either result from a disruption of an ongoing jet flow ( ` smothered ' jets ) , or from recurrent nuclear radio activity . in both these models , the central ( gps ) radio sources are young and the extended radio emission is older and fading since it is disconnected from the jet flow .",
    "a convincing example of such a source is b0108 + 388 , where motions of the radio components , observed with multi - epoch vlbi observations , imply that the pc - scale radio structure can not be much older than @xmath17 yr ( owsianik et al .",
    "the observed velocity of these components ( @xmath18 ) strongly suggests that their outflow is not hampered by a high density medium",
    ". however , carilli et al . (",
    "1998 ) observe strong redshifted hi absorption towards b0108 + 388 , which , contrary to the expectation , suggests that the source actually is surrounded by a dense environment .",
    "b0108 + 388 also exhibits a faint kpc - scale radio structure ( baum et al .",
    "1990 , carilli et al .",
    "this is considered as a strong indication that the nucleus is recurrently radio active . + sources such as b0108 + 388 strongly suggest that some radio sources have recurrent phases of radio activity .",
    "outstanding questions are how common recurrence is , and on what typical timescales it takes place ? to answer these questions , it is important to find more of these apparently rejuvenated sources .",

    "second , the flux density given in white & becker ( 1992 ) is the peak flux density , which , for an extended source like b1144 + 352 , is an underestimate of the total flux density .",

    "( 1998 ) present a model for the flux density evolution of gps sources , in which such a turn - over in flux density is expected . in their model ,",
    "the radio components are ejected from the nucleus at relativistic velocities and at a large angle to the line of sight . as a result of relativistic beaming",
    ", the intensity of the radiation emitted by such a component in the direction of the observer will be very low .",
    "only after the radio component has decelerated sufficiently , it will start to contribute significantly to the observed flux density .",
    "while the component is decelerating , it will also expand adiabatically , so that the total emitted flux will drop .",
    "the exact behaviour of the observed flux density depends on the relative importance of these two effects during the evolution of the radio source .",
    "snellen et al . (",
    "1998 ) show that during the initial phases of the deceleration the flux density will increase , due to the declining effect of relativistic beaming , while after some time , as a result of adiabatic expansion of the component , the flux density will slowly decrease . according to their model , the eastern lobe visible in the vlbi map of henstock et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , which is largely responsible for the observed change in flux density , must be in the expansion phase .",

    ".      giovaninni et al . (",
    "1995 ) have found superluminal motion in the pc - scale radio structure , with an apparent velocity of 2.4@xmath105 . in the cosmology we assume , this implies that the angle @xmath106 between the radio axis and the line of sight must be @xmath107 . considering the already large linear size of the outer structure , the lack of broad emission lines and non - thermal continuum in the optical spectrum , and the relatively low x - ray luminosity of the central source when compared with broad - line radio galaxies ( e.g. crawford & fabian 1995 ) , we believe that a value close to the upper limit of @xmath108 is more appropriate .",
    "+ if the kpc - scale structure has a similar orientation to the pc - scale structure and if it originated in the core , the armlength asymmetry of the inner structure observed in first can be explained as a pure orientation effect .",
    "we further assume that the advance velocity of the outer components is equal on both sides of the nucleus .",
    "since the armlength ratio of the outer components in the first map is @xmath109 , their advance velocity must be @xmath110 , which is much higher than what is normally found in radio galaxies ( @xmath111 , e.g. alexander & leahy 1987 ) .",
    "this would suggest that the inner lobes are expanding an in extremely low - density environment , much lower than normally found at such distances from the radio core . + also",
    "the flux density ratio of the kpc - scale components on either side of the core , if they are indeed advancing at this velocity , can be predicted under the hypothesis that the two sides are intrinsically equal and that any side - to - side difference is only due to relativistic beaming . using the formula given in pearson & zensus ( 1987 ) , and assuming that the components are discrete radio sources advancing at an angle @xmath112 with respect to the line of sight , we find an expected flux density ratio of 7.3 .",
    "the observed flux density ratio is @xmath113 , which , considering the simplifying assumptions , is not far off .",
    "however , velocities of almost @xmath114 at distances of tens of kpc from the nucleus are not expected in radio sources , and so we believe that the armlength and flux density asymmetries are caused by some other effect , most likely inhomogenities in the environment .",
    "+ an alternative hypothesis to explain the large asymmetry in armlength of the inner kpc - scale structure is that of a jet which is ejected alternatively on one side of the nucleus and then on the other ( e.g. rudnick & edgar 1984 ) .",
    "the observation that the radio structure on the eastern side appears to consist of two components , one at 21.6 kpc from the nucleus and the other at 41.2 kpc , while the radio structure on the western side only consists of a single component at 24.5 kpc from the core , appears to support such a scenario .",
    "this suggests that the outflow direction of the jet responsible for the formation of the inner structure would have ` flipped ' at least twice .",
    "a consequence of this model is that only one side of the radio source is fuelled by the jet .",
    "since radio hotspots are expected to fade very rapidly once the inflow of jet material has stopped ( within a few @xmath115 yr ; e.g. clarke & burns 1991 ) , a large asymmetry in flux density is a natural result . although statistical arguments argue against this scenario ( e.g. ensman & ulvestad 1984 ) , we can not rule out the possibility that b1144 + 352 is a special case .",
    "+ the projected distance from the hotspot in the eastern lobe to the maximum in component c of the western structure is @xmath116 kpc .",
    "if the mpc - scale structure also has a similarly oriented radio axis as the pc - scale structure , the true physical size of b1144 + 352 is @xmath117 mpc , which is not an uncommon value for giant radio sources ( e.g. saripalli et al .",
    "1986 ) .      b1144 + 352",
    "is one of two currently known gps sources which are also associated with mpc - sized radio sources .",
    "the other case is the source b1245 + 676 which has outer lobes of 1.9 mpc projected linear size ( de bruyn et al . in preparation ) .",
    "these two sources can be seen as the extremes of the few known gps sources with extended radio structures , such as those discussed by baum et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and stanghellini et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . in the case of b1144 + 352 ,",
    "the presence of sharply bound radio structures on mpc , kpc and pc - scale suggests that the agn must have gone through several phases of radio activity or , alternatively , that the jets of a continuously operating agn must have been disrupted ( or ` smothered ' ; baum et al .",
    "1990 ) several times close to the nucleus .",
    "the fact that the core is currently a gps source , and so either must be very young , or entrapped in a high density environment , adds further weight to the argument that some form of interruption of the jet flow must have occurred .",
    "since superluminal motion has been detected on pc - scales , it is unlikely that the gps source is confined by a high density medium .",
    "therefore , the most likely scenario for this source is that the nucleus is indeed recurrently radio active . odea ( 1998 ) mentions that the large fraction of gps / css galaxies that show evidence for interaction and/or mergers , suggests that such processes must be related with the formation of the radio sources .",
    "an apparent close companion is also detected near the host galaxy of b1144 + 352 ( see sect .",
    "[ sec:1144.intro ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:1144_dss ] ) .",
    "perhaps an interaction between the host galaxy and this apparent companion has disturbed the jet flow to the outer lobes , or even halted the jet formation temporarily , giving rise to the subsequent formation of the inner radio structure .",
    "+ the rise and fall in the 1.4-ghz flux density of the central source over the last 25 years and the presence of the luminous x - ray source suggest that the nucleus is currently active .",
    "the distance between the outermost maximum in the eastern inner kpc - structure and the core is @xmath118 kpc ( see tab .",
    "[ tab:1144_first ] ) , where @xmath106 is the angle between the radio axis and the line of sight .",
    "this indicates that the nucleus must have been radio active , although not necessarily continuously , for at least the last @xmath119 ) yr . here , @xmath120 is the advance velocity of the head of the jet .",
    "the presence of the gps source implies that jet material which is currently expelled from the core does not flow into the outer mpc - sized lobes anymore , and possible also not into the kpc - sized lobes either .",
    "still , a compact radio hotspot has been detected in the eastern mpc - sized radio lobe of b1144 + 352 . as has been mentioned in the last section , radio hotspots",
    "are expected to fade within a few @xmath115 yr ( clarke & burns 1991 ) .",
    "therefore , the detection of the hotspot implies that there must still be jet material arriving there .",
    "this means that the disruption of the jet can not have occurred longer ago than the travel - time of the jet material from the nucleus to this hotspot .",
    "the travel - time is @xmath121 yr , where @xmath122 is the velocity of the material flowing down the jet and which is most likely close to @xmath123 .",
    "this also gives an maximum age of the inner structure .",
    "given the constraint on the age , we find that the minimal life - time averaged advance velocity of the head of the inner structure , @xmath120 , is @xmath124 .",
    "depending on how long the radio activity was switched off this value further increases .",
    "+ if , eventually , the central kpc - scale radio source grows out to a large ( @xmath125 kpc ) radio source before the outer lobes have faded , b1144 + 352 can become a so - called ` double - double radio galaxy ' ( ddrg , schoenmakers et al .",
    "ddrgs are radio sources which consist of two unequally sized but well aligned double - lobed radio sources with a coinciding radio core .",
    "six of such objects with inner sources larger than 100  kpc are known now ( schoenmakers et al .",
    "1998b ) , and they also appear to be the result of recurrent jet - formation activity in the nucleus .",
    "sources such as b1144 + 352 and b1245 + 676 are good candidates for the progenitors of these ddrgs .",
    "we have studied the large - scale radio structure of nearby gps source b1144 + 352 .",
    "we have presented new 1.4-ghz wsrt observations , and we have obtained x - ray data from the rosat archive .",
    "our conclusions are the following : +    1 .   after a steady increase over at least 25 yr , the core flux density at 1.4 ghz has decreased by @xmath126 mjy to @xmath103 mjy ( epoch 1997.7 ) with respect to the measurements in the first survey ( epoch 1994.6 ) .",
    "this behaviour is remarkable since gps galaxies in general show only small variations in their flux density , but agrees with the predictions made by a model of the evolutionary scenario of radio components in gps sources presented by snellen et al .",
    "2 .   the eastern extended radio structure is a radio lobe with a leading hotspot and can only be associated with the central gps source .",
    "3 .   the southern part of the western structure is a radio lobe with an elongated tail .",
    "this lobe is most likely associated with the gps source .",
    "the origin of the southern tail is not clear .",
    "the total projected linear size of the large - scale radio source associated with the gps source b1144 + 352 is @xmath5 mpc , but the detection of superluminal motion in the gps source suggests that the true ( deprojected ) physical size may be @xmath117 mpc .",
    "there are differences of @xmath127 between the pc - to - kpc - scale radio axis and the mpc - scale radio axis .",
    "this means that the mpc - scale jets must have been bent .",
    "it also suggests that the outflow direction of the jet responsible for the pc - to - kpc - scale structure has changed before the formation of the kpc - scale structure .",
    "since we still see a compact hotspot in the eastern mpc - scale radio lobe , we can limit the age of the kpc - scale radio source to @xmath128 yr , with @xmath106 the angle of the radio axis with respect to the line of sight . therefore",
    ", the time - averaged advance velocity of the eastern kpc - scale component must be @xmath129 .",
    "the host galaxy of b1144 + 352 is associated with a somewhat extended x - ray source .",
    "the extension appears to have a similar position angle to the central radio source . assuming that the emission is due to an agn , with a powerlaw spectrum with photon index 1.8 , we find a luminosity of @xmath130 ergs@xmath9 between 0.1 and 2.4 kev . for a thermal bremsstrahlung model with @xmath131",
    "k and a metal abundance of 0.25 solar , we find a luminosity of @xmath132 ergs@xmath9 in the same band .",
    "such luminosities are comparable to that of powerful 3cr narrow - line radio galaxies at similar redshift .",
    "it strongly suggests that the central part of the host galaxy of b1144 + 352 does not contain a large amount of cold gas .",
    "8 .   in the environment of the gps source",
    "some sort of medium must be present to confine the extended radio structures .",
    "such a medium may reveal itself through the emission of x - rays . using the lack of a significant detection in our rosat data ,",
    "we have determined a 1@xmath15 upper limit of @xmath99 ergs@xmath9 for the @xmath133 kev x - ray luminosity within a 250 kpc radius of the host galaxy of b1144 + 352 .",
    "therefore , the radio source is not in a luminous x - ray cluster .",
    "the upper limit of the x - ray luminosity is , however , comparable to that of poor groups of galaxies , so we can not exclude the presence of an ` intra - group ' medium .",
    "optical data seem to support the presence of a small group of galaxies around the host galaxy of b1144 + 352 .",
    ".   the northern part of the western extended radio structure is a separate low - power radio galaxy which we refer to as b1144 + 353 .",
    "we have measured the redshift of the host galaxy at @xmath134 , which is not significantly different from that of the gps host galaxy ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "the projected distance to the gps host galaxy is @xmath136 kpc .",
    "+    the source b1144 + 352 is the second gps source known to be associated with a mpc - sized radio source . notwithstanding",
    "whether gps sources are young or situated in dense environments , the existence of the mpc - sized lobes implies that the jets fuelling the radio source have been able to escape the host galaxy in the past .",
    "we conclude that the best explanation for the existence of these two sources is that their jet flow must have been interrupted temporarily , either as a result of a complete halting of the jet formation or as a result of a disruption of the jet flow close to the nucleus .",
    "this makes it very likely that they are the progenitors of the ddrgs discussed by schoenmakers et al .",
    "( 1998b ) .",
    "in case of the source b1144 + 352 , the observation of superluminal motion on pc - scale indicates that the gps source it is not confined , or ` frustrated ' , by a high density medium , and that therefore the nucleus is most likely recurrently radio active . the variation in radio peak flux density observed over the last 25 years",
    "suggests that a new phase of activity may have started quite recently and that the gps source which is currently observed is extremely young .",

    "<S> we present the results of new observations of the enigmatic radio source b1144 + 352 with the wsrt at 1.4 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> this source is hosted by an @xmath0 galaxy at a redshift of @xmath1 and is one of the lowest redshift gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources known . </S>",
    "<S> it has been known to show radio structure on pc - scale in the radio core and on @xmath2 kpc - scale in two jet - like radio structures . </S>",
    "<S> the wenss and nvss surveys have now revealed faint extended radio structures on an even much larger scale . </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated these large - scale radio components with new 1.4-ghz wsrt observations . </S>",
    "<S> our radio data indicate that the eastern radio structure has a leading hotspot and we conclude that this structure is a radio lobe originating in the galaxy hosting the gps source . </S>",
    "<S> the western radio structure contains two separate radio sources which are superposed on the sky . </S>",
    "<S> the first is a low - power radio source , hosted by a @xmath3 galaxy at a similar redshift ( @xmath4 ) to the gps host galaxy ; the second is an extended radio lobe , which we believe is associated with the gps host galaxy and which contains an elongated tail . </S>",
    "<S> the total projected linear size of the extended radio structure associated with b1144 + 352 is @xmath5 mpc . </S>",
    "<S> the core of b1144 + 353 is a known variable radio source : its flux density at 1.4 ghz has increased continuously between 1974 and 1994 . </S>",
    "<S> we have measured the flux density of the core in our wsrt observations ( epoch 1997.7 ) and find a value of @xmath6 mjy . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that its flux density has decreased by @xmath7 mjy between 1994 and 1997 . </S>",
    "<S> further , we have retrieved unpublished archival rosat hri data of b1144 + 352 . </S>",
    "<S> the source has been detected and appears to be slightly extended in x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> we find a luminosity of @xmath8 ergs@xmath9 between 0.1 and 2.4 kev , assuming that the x - ray emission is due to an agn with a powerlaw spectrum with photon index 1.8 , or @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> ergs@xmath9 if it is due to thermal bremsstrahlung at @xmath11  k. the detection of the x - ray source suggests that the intrinsic hi column density can not be much larger than a few times @xmath12  @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the non - detection of an extended x - ray halo in a radius of 250 kpc around the host galaxy limits the x - ray luminosity of an intra - cluster gas component within this radius to @xmath14 ergs@xmath9 ( 1@xmath15 upper limit ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is below the luminosity of an x - ray luminous cluster and is more comparable to that of poor groups of galaxies . also the optical data show no evidence for a rich cluster around the host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> b1144 + 352 is the second gps galaxy known to be associated with a mpc - sized radio source , the other being b1245 + 676 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the observed structure in both these gps radio sources must be the result of an interrupted central jet - activity , and that as such they may well be the progenitors of sources belonging to the class of double - double radio galaxy .    </S>",
    "<S> radio continuum : galaxies  galaxies : active  galaxies : jets  galaxies : individual : b1144 + 352 , b1144 + 353  x - rays : galaxies </S>"
