    "on the occasion of doron zeilberger s sixtieth birthday i present two conjectures on arithmetic properties of binomial coefficients .",
    "these conjectures epitomize the celebrated zeilbergerian experimental approach to mathematics .",
    "they began as naive questions .",
    "answers to these questions were computed ( by a machine ) in many specific instances , and the data was analyzed ( by a human with the assistance of a machine ) for patterns . from such experiments , and in the case of the second conjecture after a fair amount of work , the author formulated and simplified the statements of the conjectures , which were then verified against additional data .",
    "perhaps most importantly , the conjectures given in this paper are empirical claims and are unproven ! we do however condescend to prove some propositions .",
    "accompanying these two conjectures are two stories .",
    "arithmetic properties of binomial coefficients have a long and interesting history , a major theme of which is that properties of @xmath3 involving the prime @xmath4 are related to the standard base-@xmath4 representations @xmath5 and @xmath6 of @xmath2 and @xmath7 .",
    "the theorems of kummer  @xcite and lucas  @xcite are important examples of this relationship .",
    "let @xmath4 be a prime , and let @xmath8 .",
    "the exponent of the highest power of @xmath4 dividing @xmath3 is the number of borrows involved in subtracting @xmath7 from @xmath2 in base @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath4 is a prime and @xmath8 , then @xmath9    the relationship between @xmath3 and the base-@xmath4 representations of @xmath2 and @xmath7 can be thought of as a consequence of the self - similarity present in both pascal s triangle and base-@xmath10 representations of nonnegative integers .",
    "figure  [ mod powers of 2 ] shows pascal s triangle modulo powers of @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , this relationship provides a natural rendering of number theoretic questions about binomial coefficients in terms of combinatorial questions about words .",
    "we shall use the notation @xmath12 to denote the number of occurrences of the word @xmath13 in the base-@xmath4 representation @xmath5 , where @xmath4 is the prime implied by context .     for @xmath14 , in which nested structure can be seen .",
    "]    both conjectures in the paper are concerned with the values of @xmath3 modulo @xmath10 .",
    "the first conjecture concerns counting binomial coefficients @xmath3 equivalent to a certain residue class modulo @xmath0 , for fixed @xmath2 .",
    "the second conjecture concerns the value of @xmath1 modulo @xmath2 .",
    "counting binomial coefficients is a sort of `` meta - combinatorics ''  we are counting the counters !",
    "one basic question we can ask about pascal s triangle modulo @xmath10 is how many nonzero entries there are on row @xmath2 .",
    "this question was answered for prime @xmath15 by fine  @xcite and shown to be @xmath16 . for prime powers",
    "@xmath17 an expression was found by the author  @xcite .",
    "there has been no progress in the case of composite @xmath10 .",
    "here we shall be interested in a refinement of the previous question : let @xmath18 be the number of integers @xmath8 such that @xmath19 ; what is the structure of @xmath18 ?",
    "the first result on @xmath18 was glaisher s 1899  @xcite discovery that @xmath20 .",
    "after that there appears to have been no results until 1978 , when hexel and sachs  @xcite determined a formula for @xmath21 for any prime @xmath4 in terms of @xmath22th roots of unity , where @xmath23 is a primitive root modulo @xmath4 . from this",
    "they derived @xmath24 as well as explicit formulas for @xmath25 in terms of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "garfield and wilf  @xcite exhibited a method to compute the generating function @xmath30 , where again @xmath23 is a primitive root .",
    "recently , amdeberhan and stanley  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.1 ) studied the number of coefficients equal to @xmath23 in the @xmath2th power of a general multivariate polynomial over a finite field , where @xmath23 is an invertible element of the field .",
    "they showed that if @xmath31 $ ] then the number @xmath32 of coefficients in @xmath33 equal to @xmath34 is a @xmath35-regular sequence , meaning that it satisfies linear recurrences in @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "the first results for a non - prime modulus were formulas for @xmath37 given by davis and webb  @xcite :    @xmath38    ( where @xmath12 counts occurrences of @xmath13 in the base-@xmath11 representation of @xmath2 ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath23 is odd then @xmath37 is either @xmath39 or a power of @xmath11 .",
    "granville observed that in a sense the statement that @xmath37 is either @xmath39 or a power of @xmath11 parallels glaisher s result that @xmath20 is ( either @xmath39 or ) a power of @xmath11 .",
    "granville asked whether a similar statement is true modulo @xmath40 .",
    "his delightful paper `` zaphod beeblebrox s brain and the fifty - ninth row of pascal s triangle ''  @xcite contains the following theorem .",
    "if @xmath23 is odd then @xmath41 is either @xmath39 or a power of @xmath11 .",
    "as in the case of @xmath37 , for even @xmath23 other values occur .",
    "for example , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "granville goes on to consider the number of binomial coefficients congruent to an odd residue class @xmath23 modulo @xmath0 , and he discovers that the analogous statement fails for @xmath44 !",
    "granville writes : `` unbelievably , there are exactly six entries of row @xmath45 in each of the congruence classes @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ! our pattern has come to an end , but not before providing us with some interesting mathematics , as well as a couple of pleasant surprises . ''",
    "but this is nt the end of the story !",
    "we are now lead to ask : what values _ does _",
    "@xmath50 take for odd @xmath23 ?",
    "explicit computation shows that up to row @xmath51 the set of values that occur is @xmath52 this computation took nearly three cpu weeks to complete .",
    "it is clear that the only odd number that occurs is @xmath46 , since @xmath53 is even for @xmath54 , so @xmath50 is even .",
    "but the data suggests that @xmath50 does not take on every even number .",
    "fix @xmath2 and odd @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath50 is divisible by @xmath55 , then it is also divisible by @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath50 is divisible by @xmath56 , then it is also divisible by @xmath57 .",
    "if @xmath50 is divisible by @xmath58 , then it is also divisible by @xmath59 .",
    "if @xmath50 is divisible by @xmath47 , then it is also divisible by @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath50 is divisible by @xmath48 , then it is also divisible by @xmath61 .",
    "if @xmath50 is divisible by @xmath62 , then it is also divisible by @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath50 is divisible by @xmath64 , then it is also divisible by @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , these eight primes are the only primes that appear up to row @xmath51 .",
    "of course , there is a probably a more general and more compact conjecture waiting to be discovered .",
    "however , it is not clear what the corresponding powers of @xmath11 might be for larger primes .",
    "granville s analysis of @xmath41 was long ( and in fact incomplete  @xcite ) .",
    "however , it should be possible to automate granville s work in true zeilberger fashion .",
    "we do not undertake this work here , but once this is done and understood , the methodology will likely be applicable to @xmath50 , and perhaps the statements in the conjecture and the larger context surrounding them will become clear . hopefully a reader will take up this challenge !",
    "we all know the feeling of anxiety caused by witnessing a calculus student apply the `` high school dream '' @xmath65 in which exponentiation distributes over addition .",
    "but of course the high school dream is actually valid on occasion . in particular ,",
    "@xmath66 , since @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "we might then ask : how badly does the high school dream fail for non - primes ? what is @xmath3 modulo @xmath2 , and how frequently is it nonzero ?",
    "with such an answer we can precisely quantify how upset at students we are entitled to get !    rather than study @xmath3 modulo @xmath2 directly , we divide by @xmath2 and consider @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the fractional part of @xmath71 .",
    "we can recover the value of @xmath3 modulo @xmath2 from @xmath72 .",
    "figure  [ n choose m mod n ] displays @xmath69 graphically .",
    "the principal advantage of reformulating in this way is that for fixed @xmath73 the sequence @xmath69 for @xmath54 is periodic , which we soon prove .",
    "for example , if @xmath74 the sequence @xmath69 is @xmath75 if @xmath76 the sequence is @xmath77 and if @xmath78 it is @xmath79 with period length @xmath80 .",
    "the proof of periodicity follows from a result of lu and tsai  @xcite .     through @xmath81 of pascal s triangle , where @xmath3 is assigned the gray value between @xmath39 ( white ) and @xmath46 ( black ) corresponding to @xmath69 . ]",
    "let @xmath82 and @xmath73 . the sequence @xmath83 modulo @xmath7 for @xmath84 is periodic with ( minimal ) period length @xmath85    we now apply the lu ",
    "tsai result to @xmath86 .",
    "let @xmath73 .",
    "the sequence @xmath69 for @xmath54 is periodic with period length @xmath87    the factor @xmath88 can be interpreted as the largest power of @xmath4 that is strictly less than @xmath7 .",
    "we have @xmath89 taking the fractional part of both sides and letting @xmath90 in the previous theorem gives the desired result .    in the remainder of the paper we aim to compute @xmath69 in two cases  when @xmath91 and when @xmath92 .",
    "the case when @xmath91 is fairly simple .",
    "let @xmath93 be @xmath46 if the statement @xmath94 is true and @xmath39 if @xmath94 is false .    if @xmath4 is a prime and @xmath54 , then @xmath95    by the previous proposition , the period length of @xmath96 is @xmath4 , so the values of @xmath96 for @xmath54 are determined by the values for @xmath97 . for @xmath98",
    "we have @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "therefore @xmath101 is zero modulo @xmath2 with frequency @xmath102 .",
    "we provide a second proof of this proposition that is more similar to the proof of the final proposition of the section .",
    "we require two preliminary results .",
    "the first follows immediately from kummer s theorem .",
    "let @xmath103 be the exponent of the highest power of @xmath4 dividing @xmath2 .    if @xmath4 is a prime and @xmath8 , then @xmath104 .",
    "the second is a result discovered by anton in 1869 and rediscovered by both stickelberger and hensel that determines the value modulo @xmath4 of a binomial coefficient removed of its @xmath4 factors  @xcite .",
    "recall that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the representations of @xmath2 and @xmath7 in base @xmath4 .",
    "we write @xmath105 for the @xmath106th base-@xmath4 digit of @xmath107 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a prime , and let @xmath8 .",
    "we have @xmath108    note that the arithmetic on the right side of the congruence takes place in @xmath109 , not @xmath110 .",
    "we are now ready to give the second proof .",
    "we show that @xmath111 .    for any integer @xmath7 , @xmath112 , so in particular @xmath113 .    if @xmath114 then @xmath4 is invertible modulo @xmath2 , so @xmath115 .    if @xmath116 , let @xmath117 and write @xmath118 .",
    "we show that @xmath119 .",
    "since @xmath120 and @xmath121 , we have @xmath122 .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath123 . by the lemma , @xmath124 .",
    "write @xmath125 .",
    "one checks that the ratio in anton s theorem is @xmath126 it follows that @xmath127 , so multiplying by @xmath128 gives @xmath123 .    when @xmath7 is not prime , the behavior of @xmath69 is more complex .",
    "our second conjecture concerns the case @xmath129 .",
    "the period length of @xmath130 for @xmath131 is @xmath132 .",
    "however , the conjecture states that we may specify these @xmath132 values in a more concise way than by listing them explicitly .",
    "first we prove a result for @xmath133 .    if @xmath4 is a prime and @xmath54 , then @xmath134    for example , if @xmath135 then the sequence @xmath133 is @xmath136    as in the proof of the previous proposition , @xmath137 , so @xmath138 .",
    "first consider @xmath139 .",
    "the period length of @xmath140 is @xmath141 .",
    "the period length of @xmath142 is also @xmath141 , so one checks that the first @xmath141 values of the two sequences agree .",
    "let @xmath131 .    if @xmath114 then @xmath143 .",
    "if @xmath116 , let @xmath117 and write @xmath118 . we show that @xmath144 .",
    "since @xmath145 and @xmath146 , it suffices to show that @xmath147 .",
    "let @xmath148 , and write @xmath149 . by the lemma , @xmath150 .",
    "we consider two cases . if @xmath151 , the ratio in anton s theorem is @xmath152 in this case @xmath153 and @xmath154 , so @xmath155 as desired . alternatively , if @xmath156 , the ratio is @xmath157 so ( since @xmath158 ) @xmath159 now if @xmath160 then @xmath161 , so this becomes @xmath162 which is sufficient since @xmath163 .",
    "if on the other hand @xmath164 then @xmath165 , so we have @xmath166    since @xmath167 , it follows that , for a given @xmath2 and @xmath4 , @xmath168 is either @xmath169 or @xmath170 , depending on whether @xmath171 is even or odd .",
    "for example , if @xmath135 then @xmath171 is even unless @xmath2 is congruent to one of @xmath172 modulo @xmath80 .    however , we can significantly simplify this condition by rewriting the previous proposition instead as @xmath173 .",
    "now @xmath168 is either @xmath174 or @xmath175 , depending on whether @xmath176 is even or odd . taking @xmath135 again , @xmath176 is even unless @xmath2 is congruent to one of @xmath177 modulo @xmath40 .",
    "the following conjecture claims that we can determine when this second criterion holds  and thereby compute @xmath130  by examining the binary representation of @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath178 be the number @xmath179 such that @xmath180 .",
    "by ` @xmath181 ' we mean the number of zeros in the standard binary representation of @xmath7 ( with no leading zeros ) .",
    "note however that ` @xmath182 ' still refers to the base-@xmath4 representation of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath131 be a prime , let @xmath129 , and let @xmath6 be the standard base-@xmath11 representation of @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath54 .",
    "then @xmath183 is odd if and only if @xmath184 for some @xmath185 .",
    "letting @xmath186 be the statement that @xmath176 is odd , it follows from the conjecture that @xmath187    let us compute some examples of the exceptional residue classes given by the conjecture .",
    "let @xmath135 .",
    "for @xmath188 we obtain @xmath189 for @xmath190 the exceptional residue class is @xmath191    in general , one can think of the sum in the conjecture as performing an operation similar to the product @xmath192 of @xmath193 and @xmath194 in base @xmath11 .",
    "for example , let @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "the product @xmath197 is computed as follows using the standard multiplication algorithm .",
    "@xmath198 to compute the expression @xmath199 we truncate and shift each instance of @xmath194 as follows .",
    "@xmath200    as with conjecture  1 , a proof of conjecture  2 will undoubtedly provide more context for the result and will perhaps reveal a more natural formulation .",
    "we have also not addressed the computational feasibility of computing @xmath130 using conjecture  2 .",
    "in particular , there is no obvious way of quickly determining whether there is an appropriate @xmath194 establishing that @xmath2 belongs to an exceptional residue class .",
    "however , conjecture  2 is suggestive in its departure from traditional results for prime power moduli .",
    "the immediate question is whether it can be generalized to @xmath201 .",
    "the author does not know the answer .",
