    "since their discovery in 1991  @xcite , carbon nanotubes have raised an enormous interest both from the academic and the technological points of view .",
    "they exhibit in fact a variety of exciting features : their quasi - one - dimensional nature , due to a diameter of 1 - 2 @xmath6 and a length of up to several micrometers , makes them sharp probes for scanning tunneling microscopes and an excellent model for one - dimensional physics .",
    "their mechanical and tensile strength make them of great interest in composite materials , and , most significantly of all , they have very unusual and extremely promising electronic properties , displaying metallic or semiconducting behavior according to their structure and helicity  @xcite .",
    "the electronic properties of swnts , already particularly interesting from the technological point of view , promise to be the future of nano - electronics due to their _ tunability _ , achieved by doping the nanotubes through intercalation with alkali atoms @xcite or application of a gate potential  @xcite . however , there are still a number of experimental challenges to be solved in order to fully develop swnt - based nano - electronic technology , in particular the low - cost industrial - scale synthesis of nanotubes of good chemical purity , crystalline quality and given helicity .",
    "an experimental tool largely used to characterize swnts is raman spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "typical raman spectra of carbon nanotubes display a peak around 150 - 300 @xmath17 , due to the radial breathing mode ( rbm ) , which has been recently used as a tool to infer the size and chirality of the nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "other important features of swnt raman spectra include a peak around 1350 @xmath17 , activated by defects and impurities , and known in the literature as @xmath14 peak , and a large structure around 1570 @xmath17 , due to modes tangential to the nanotube and known as @xmath18 peak .",
    "this last feature is thought to have two components , usually referred to as @xmath19 and @xmath2 , originating from the @xmath20 in - plane modes of graphite . in refs .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that in metallic swnts the @xmath19 component corresponds to the tangential vibrational mode _ perpendicular _ to the nanotube axial direction , while the @xmath2 component corresponds to the tangential vibrational mode _",
    "parallel _ to the nanotube axial direction . in the following",
    ", we will refer to the former as `` the nanotube to tangential mode '' , and to the latter as `` the nanotube lo axial mode '' .",
    "some raman studies  @xcite show that the frequency of the @xmath18 peak increases up to 1600 @xmath17 at low doping levels , and then suddenly drops to about 1550 @xmath17 at the saturation threshold of alkali intercalation , estimated around a number of electrons per carbon atom @xmath21 ( mc@xmath22 ) .",
    "other experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite works on the effect of doping on swnts report a similar @xmath18-peak softening or even a luttinger - fermi liquid transition  @xcite .",
    "since the lo axial and to tangential modes are particularly sensitive to the electronic structure of swnts around the fermi energy  @xcite @xmath0 , and @xmath0 directly depends on the charge doping level , a profound understanding of the interplay between the vibrational and the electronic properties of nanotubes looks to be crucial for technological development .    in this work",
    "we report our theoretical study of the electronic and vibrational properties of doped swnts , based on dft first - principles calculations and analytical results .",
    "we will show in the following that : _ i ) _ the vibrational properties of swnts can be obtained from the so - called _ electronic zone - folding _ of a graphene sheet ; _ ii ) _ their behavior as a function of the charge doping level can be determined by the knowledge of electron - phonon coupling ( epc ) in graphene ; _ iii ) _ ordinary quantum - mechanics calculations relying on the adiabatic born - oppenheimer approximation fail when applied to swnts , where non - adiabatic effects are enhanced by their intrinsic one - dimensional nature .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section  [ theo ] we will describe our theoretical framework , and in particular how the raman - active modes of a nanotube can be accurately obtained through an appropriate electronic sampling of the graphene brillouin zone ( bz )",
    ". we will then show in section  [ model ] that the dft results can be almost perfectly reproduced by an integral model , that uses the graphite epc and the slope of the electronic bands around the ( undoped ) fermi level @xmath23 ( usually referred to as the @xmath24 and @xmath12 bands ) as external inputs , and that becomes analytical in the limit of vanishing temperature .",
    "the results on the dft and the model - derived lo axial and to tangential modes of a swnt will be presented , showing that kohn anomalies ( ka ) would occur , within the adiabatic approximation , each time a new electronic band is populated by the electrons at @xmath0 . in section  [ nonadia ] we show that when the born - oppenheimer approximation is lifted the outcome is dramatically different , and that a drop in the frequency of the @xmath2 peak occurs at a doping level such that @xmath25 or close to the saturation level .",
    "section  [ conclusions ] will be devoted to the discussion of the physical properties of metallic swnts that are experimentally accessible , and to the conclusions .",
    "graphene is a semimetal , and its highest valence and lowest conduction bands have a circular conical surface shape around the points * k * and * k@xmath26 * of the hexagonal first brillouin zone at zero doping ; its fermi surface is reduced to the vertexes of the cones at those two points .    the structure of a swnt is obtained by rolling a sheet of 2d graphene , and closing both ends with fullerene - like semi - spheres .",
    "however , nanotubes are commonly studied as infinite 1d crystals , _ i.e. _ neglecting the details of those ends .",
    "nanotubes are then uniquely determined by the knowledge of the chiral vector @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the basis vectors of graphene , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are integers  @xcite .",
    "the translational vector determines the periodicity along the tube axis and is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the greatest common divisor of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "nanotubes with indexes such that @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is an integer , are metallic , otherwise they are semiconductors .",
    "nanotubes with identical indexes , _",
    "i.e. n = m _ , are thus always metallic , and are usually called `` armchair '' tube",
    ".    electronic zone folding ( ezf ) is a common approximation for the electronic band structure of a swnt , which consists in neglecting the curvature of the swnt . within the ezf",
    "the electronic states of a swnt are approximated by the electronic states of a graphene sheet having wavevector @xmath38 such that @xmath39 , being @xmath40 an integer .",
    "the wave - vectors allowed for the swnt satisfy @xmath41 where @xmath37 is a real , @xmath42 is parallel to the tube axis , @xmath43 is perpendicular to the tube axis and satisfies @xmath44 , @xmath45 being the tube diameter .",
    "this way of constructing the electronic band structure accounts for the fact that swnts can be either metallic or semiconducting .",
    "in fact , if in swnts a line of allowed wave vectors * k * crosses the * k * or the * k@xmath26 * point , the nanotube is metallic , otherwise it is a semiconductor . in particular , in the bz of armchair metallic swnts the section of the vertical plane containing the @xmath46 line of * k * vectors and the conical bands consists of two straight lines of slope @xmath47 , while the conic sections for @xmath48 consist of arms of hyperbolae .",
    "the energy difference between the maximum of the lower arm and the minimum of the upper arm are usually indicated as @xmath49 in the metallic case ( see also fig .",
    "[ fermi ] ) .",
    "previous works  @xcite have shown that the effects of the nanotube curvature can be neglected as a first approximation for swnts whose diameter is larger than 1 @xmath6 ( the most common nanotubes present in experimental samples ) and the electronic properties of a nanotube can be quite accurately obtained from ezf .",
    "the explicit calculation of the full dynamical matrix of an infinite nanotube , even within an efficient scheme such as density - functional perturbation theory ( dfpt )  @xcite , is a quite demanding task from the computational point of view . on the other hand ,",
    "the swnt vibrational modes typically observed in raman spectra can be traced back to the phonon and elastic modes of an isolated graphene sheet .",
    "however , it has been shown that the phonon dispersions of swnts can not be as accurately reconstructed from the graphene ones as the electronic bands , because of the presence of kas which behave differently in graphene  @xcite and metallic swnts  @xcite .",
    "the kas are determined by singularities in the electron screening and such singularities depends on the dimensionality of the electron brillouin zone .",
    "the dimensionality is two for graphene and one for swnts .",
    "this reduced swnt dimensionality is due to the quantization ( _ confinement _ ) of the electronic wavevector around the nanotube circumference , which is actually described by the ezf .",
    "this last consideration suggests a practical scheme for the calculation of the phonon dispersion in swnts which neglects curvature , but fully takes into account the more important confinement effects .",
    "phonons in nanotubes are well approximated by the phonons of a flat graphene sheet , if the calculation is done performing the electronic brillouin - zone integration on the lines of the electronic zone - folding ( eq .  [ nano_nu ] ) .",
    "such phonon calculation method ( phonon - ezf ) was introduced in refs .",
    "a phonon - ezf calculation requires the use of a unit cell containing two atoms and thus , is clearly much less computationally demanding than full calculations on an actual swnt , which requires a unit - cell with tens or hundreds of atoms . in subsect .",
    "[ accuracy ] we will demonstrate that , for the preset study , curvature effects are negligible and the phonon - ezf provides an accurate description of the high - frequency phonon modes .",
    "our first - principles calculations are based on dft , within the plane - wave ( pw)/pseudopotential scheme implemented in the quantum - espresso code  @xcite .",
    "we adopt a perdew - burke - erzherhof gradient corrected functional , and an ultrasoft pseudopotential to describe the @xmath10 atom .",
    "a pw kinetic energy cutoff of 30 ry is sufficient to ensure convergence on the structural , electronic , and vibrational properties .",
    "we choose as a case - study the ( 9,9 ) metallic armchair swnt , containing 36 distinct carbon atoms , and having a tube diameter of 1.24 @xmath6 .",
    "the full nanotube calculations are performed by setting the nanotube in an infinite lattice of hexagonal symmetry in the plane perpendicular to the tube axis , mimicking thus the bulk effect of a real nanotube bundle or an isolated tube by tuning the lattice parameter between 1.56 @xmath6 and 1.72 @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath50 axis is maintained constant .",
    "integrations in the nanotube one - dimensional brillouin zone have been performed by using regular grids of * k * points along the @xmath50 reciprocal axis .",
    "we use a fermi - dirac electronic smearing of 0.01 ry ( corresponding to an electronic temperature of 1578 k ) for swnt full phonon calculations , and of 0.002 ry ( 315 k ) for structural calculations and frozen - phonon tests ( see below ) .",
    "grids of 8 and 40 * k * points were sufficient , respectively , to ensure a good convergence ( @xmath11 5 @xmath17 ) on the lo axial frequencies in the two cases .",
    "in the phonon - ezf calculation we use a graphene hexagonal unit cell of lattice parameter @xmath51  and @xmath52  .",
    "the number of points is chosen as to ensure phonon frequencies converged within about 0.3 @xmath17 , and is inversely proportional to temperature . at a temperature of 315 k ,",
    "the total number of points is 3240 , equivalent to 180 points along the @xmath50 direction of the reciprocal space of the ( 9,9 ) nanotube , while at 1578 k this number reduces to 720 , equivalent to 40 points in the nanotube case .",
    "for both the full nanotube and the phonon - ezf case , the effect of ( low ) charge doping is simulated by adding an excess electronic charge which is compensated by a uniformly charged backgournd .",
    "this is done using the standard implementation of the espresso - package  @xcite .",
    "this approach is known to describe very well the properties of doped swnts  @xcite .",
    "this is justified even in the case of alkali intercalation by the report that at low doping levels , _",
    "i.e. _ up to mc@xmath53 , the electronic charge of the metal atoms is thought to be completely transferred  @xcite , and that the effect of the intercalation is essentially described by taking into account the sole effect of the charge transfer .",

    "we analogously compare the phonon - ezf lo axial frequency with a full dfpt nanotube phonon calculation at 1578 k. in this latter case , all the 108 @xmath54 vibrational modes of the nanotube are explicitly calculated ; a lower temperature , and thus a correspondingly larger grid of at least 40 * k * points , would be computationally too demanding for a complete and accurate study of the problem .",
    "both graphs show that phonon - ezf not only determines the nanotube phonon frequencies in good agreement with explicit swnt calculations , but it also captures very well the strikingly non - monotonic dependence of the lo axial mode with respect to electronic doping , to be discussed later on , confirming that the effects of the swnt curvature can be confidently neglected for a ( 9,9 ) armchair nanotube , and that phonon - ezf is a reliable and accurate method .",
