    "the idea that cosmic - rays ( up to @xmath4 ev ) are produced by shock acceleration in supernova remnants ( snrs ) has recently gained wide acceptance ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although the details of the snr cosmic - ray acceleration process remain uncertain , many of the current models predict spatial variations in the spectral indices of snrs at the sites of cosmic - ray acceleration ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "the spectral index variations predicted by many of these models are most easily discerned at low radio frequencies .",
    "there is also evidence that some of the low latitude unidentified egret @xmath5-ray sources may be associated with sites of snr / molecular cloud interactions , implying that these sources are particularly efficient at producing high energy cosmic - rays ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "thus , sites of snr / molecular cloud interaction represent a promising place to look for signatures of shock acceleration .",
    "however , unambiguous evidence for snr / molecular cloud interactions is difficult to find due to galactic velocity confusion in the low-@xmath6 molecular lines generally used for such searches , so that only a handful of such sources are currently known ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "a further complication is the determination of whether observed spectral index variations are intrinsic to the synchrotron emission , or are affected by other processes .",
    "using integrated flux measurements , @xcite found that @xmath7 of galactic snrs undergo a spectral turnover for frequencies @xmath8 mhz .",
    "these low frequency turnovers have been attributed to free - free absorption in low density @xmath9 @xmath10 intermediate temperature ( @xmath11 k ) ionized thermal gas along the line of sight to the snr .",
    "the ubiquitous detection of low frequency radio recombination lines ( rrls ) amplified by stimulated emission , towards almost every direction in the inner galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "spatially resolved low frequency observations of snrs with absorption will be crucial for understanding the origin of the absorbing medium .",
    "also , while such absorption is interesting in its own right for understanding the composition of the ism , it hinders efforts to look for unambiguous spectral index variations predicted by cosmic - ray acceleration models .",
    "therefore , quantifying the level and origin of free - free absorption toward snrs is also critical to studies of the cosmic - ray shock acceleration process .",
    "the first spatially resolved observations of extrinsic low frequency absorption toward an snr were made by @xcite toward w49b using the then recently completed 74  mhz system at the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "these authors found that most of the low frequency absorption implied by previous low resolution integrated flux measurements is confined to the western half of the remnant , and is spatially coincident with a neutral hi column density peak at a kinematic distance well in front of the snr .",
    "evidence for the requisite ionized gas comes from radio recombination line ( rrl ) detections at the same velocity as the neutral hi gas .",

    "overall , the x - ray morphology of 3c  391 places it in the `` mixed morphology '' or `` thermal composite '' class @xcite .",
    "that is , the x - ray emission is brightest interior to the radio synchrotron shell , with weak or no emission coincident with the radio shell . in all of the x - ray studies described above , the centroid of soft x - ray emission is offset to the se of the harder x - ray emission .",
    "this has been interpreted as an absorption effect due to the extra column density provided by the molecular cloud to the nw @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the column density difference implied by the soft x - ray absorption is @xmath19 @xmath20 .",

    "we observed the supernova remnant 3c  391 using the very large array ( vla ) at 74 mhz using the a , b , & c configurations .",
    "in addition , we obtained 330 c configuration and 1465 mhz d configuration data from the vla archive .",
    "this combination of configurations provides comparable @xmath24 coverage at all three frequencies  a prerequisite for believable spectral index calculations .",
    "the observing parameters for each frequency are presented in table 1 .",
    "the 74 and 330  mhz data were reduced using the wide - field imaging and calibration techniques described in ( * ? ? ? * , and references therein ) .",
    "the 1465 mhz data were reduced in the usual manner .",
    "all data reduction utilized the aips software package .",
    "the final resolution of the 74 mhz image after combining the four datasets described in table 1 is @xmath25 .",
    "this resolution is about 2.8 times larger than what is technically feasible from the longest a configuration baseline ( 30 km ) .",
    "this is due in part to the fact that the a - configuration 74  mhz data were taken under poor ionospheric conditions which caused the longest baselines to have incoherent phases . to mitigate this effect",
    "the 74  mhz data were imaged with a @xmath24 taper of 5.5 k@xmath26 ( this corresponds to a baseline length of 22 km ) .",
    "in addition , the combination of a+b+c configuration data pushes the final resolution to one that is intermediate ( b ) between the configuration extremes ( a and c ) .",
    "the 330 and 1465 mhz images were convolved to match the @xmath25 of the 74 mhz images .",
    "this convolution was minimal for both the c configuration 330 mhz and d configuration 1465 mhz data ( each with an uncovnvolved resolution of @xmath27 resolution ) .    since 3c  391",
    "is located @xmath28 from the phase center of the 74 mhz data , primary beam correction was applied to this image ( the radius of the fwhm primary beam of the vla at 74  mhz is @xmath29 ) .",
    "no primary beam correction was necessary at 330 and 1465 mhz since 3c  391 subtends a small fraction of the primary beam at these frequencies and 3c  391 was located at the phase center of these observations .",
    "the rms noise levels achieved in each image are : 75 , 15 , and 3 mjy  beam@xmath3 at 74 , 330 , and 1465 mhz , respectively . note that these rms noise levels are significantly higher than theoretical , due to imperfect @xmath24 coverage ( especially for the archival data ) and galactic confusion .",
    "figure 1a shows our 330  mhz @xmath25 resolution continuum image of 3c  391 , while figure 1b shows a 330/1465 mhz spectral index map of 3c  391 . even at this fairly coarse resolution",
    "it is apparent that 3c  391 has a rim - brightened morphology on its western side and has a breakout morphology to the se indicating that the remnant is unbounded in this region ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for higher resolution images ) .",
    "figure 1c shows the notably different morphology of the 74  mhz emission , while figure 1d shows the 74/330  mhz spectral index . for both spectral index maps ,",
    "the images were masked at the @xmath30 level before the spectral index was calculated ( we use the definition @xmath15 ) .",
    "neglecting edge effects ( the spectral index maps become more uncertain with decreasing continuum brightness ) , the 330/1465 mhz spectral index map is quite uniform with an average spectral index of @xmath31 .",
    "the 74/330 mhz spectral index map is dramatically different from the 330/1465 mhz map . indeed the 74/330  mhz spectral indices are inverted to positive values in a ring like morphology around the snr .",
    "such spectral behavior is contrary to that expected of nonthermal emission and is indicative of free - free absorption at 74  mhz , the morphology of which is revealed here for the first time .",
    "integrated flux density measurements were made for the three frequencies in our study for 3c  391 .",
    "since the images have different noise levels , and 3c  391 has a `` breakout '' morphology to the se that gradually fades into the noise it was difficult to determine where the boundary of the snr should be drawn .",
    "therefore , in order to get comparable flux density estimates , the @xmath30 ( 60 mjy  beam@xmath3 ) contour of the 330  mhz image ( see figure 1a ) was used to define the boundary for all of the integrated flux measurements .",
    "the integrated flux densities are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 jy at 1465 , 330 , and 74  mhz , respectively .",
    "the errors on these flux density measurements were estimated by @xmath35 at each frequency .",
    "a plot of the integrated continuum spectrum of 3c  391 is shown in figure 2 including data from the current work and integrated flux densities from the literature for cases in which an error estimate is available and the error is less than 20% .",
    "as described in  1 , it has been known for some time that 3c  391 has a low radio frequency turnover , and this effect is quite apparent in figure 2 for @xmath36 mhz . in order to determine the properties of the turnover , we have made a weighted least squares fit of the integrated flux densities shown in fig .",
    "2 to the equation @xmath37,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the flux density and optical depth at a fiducial frequency of 330  mhz , respectively , and @xmath40 is the integrated spectral index @xcite .",
    "this equation assumes a standard nonthermal constant power law spectrum and allows for a thermal absorption turnover at lower frequencies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the free - free continuum optical depth at other frequencies can be estimated from @xmath41 . the best fit parameters using the data shown in figure 2 are @xmath42 jy , @xmath43 and an average optical depth at 74  mhz of @xmath44 . the average optical depth at 330  mhz is 0.08 , indicating that the emission at this frequency is little affected by free - free absorption , although the average 330/1465 mhz spectral index ( @xmath31 ) is slightly shallower than that calculated from the full spectrum ( @xmath45 ) due to this effect .",
    "the derived value of the integrated @xmath44 is about a factor of two larger than that predicted by @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is due in large part to the fact that the @xcite fit includes a @xmath46 30.9 mhz _ non - detection _",
    "upper limit , whereas we have not included this data point in our fit ( although this upper limit does appear on fig . 2 for reference ) .",
    "in addition , we also use a weighted least squares fit which places greater emphasis on the more precise flux measurements , including the three new flux measurements from this study . from figure 2 it is clear that the flux density of 3c  391 at 30.9 mhz is likely to be significantly lower than the @xmath46 30.9 mhz detection limit of the @xcite data .",
    "thus , we are confident that this increase in the @xmath47 estimate is real , but an even lower frequency _ detection _ ( i.e. @xmath48 mhz ) would better constrain the fit .",
    "figure 3a shows hard x - ray emission contours integrated from 2.6 - 10 kev from asca @xcite superposed on the 74/330  mhz spectral index map .",
    "the hard x - rays are little affected by absorption and indicate the full extent of the snr .",
    "soft x - ray contours integrated from 0.5 - 2.6 kev from asca @xcite superposed on the 74/330 mhz spectral index map are presented in figure 3b .",
    "in contrast to the hard x - rays , the soft x - rays are dramatically absorbed toward the western side of the snr .",
    "this is indicative of an enhanced column density of hydrogen gas ( both molecular and neutral ) toward the nw and western sides of the snr compared to the se as discussed in  1.1 .",
    "the region of higher column density ( indicated by regions with hard x - rays but no soft x - rays ) is well correlated with that of the deepest 74  mhz absorption .",
    "figure 3c shows co ( 2@xmath491 ) integrated emission contours from 91 to 110 km / s tracing the molecular cloud that is interacting with 3c 391 @xcite superposed on the 74/330  mhz spectral index map .",
    "the oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers discovered by @xcite are also indicated for reference .",
    "much of the co ( @xmath50 ) emission shown in figure 3c has narrow line widths , indicating that it has not yet been affected by the shock . only toward the co emission peak ( near the southern oh maser source )",
    "is there obvious evidence for shocked co gas @xcite .",
    "figure 3d shows mid infrared emission contours from isocam at 12 - 18 @xmath51 m from @xcite superposed on the 74/330  mhz spectral index map .",
    "there is impressive agreement between the regions of strongest 74  mhz absorption and the 12 - 18 @xmath51 m ir emission shown in fig . 3d .",
    "such a correlation may seem somewhat unexpected since dust can not be responsible for the free - free absorption .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that the bulk of the infrared emission in the 12 - 18 @xmath51 m range toward 3c 391 arises from fine structure atomic [ neii ] and [ neiii ] infrared lines .",
    "these authors also found that the only regions that do have significant dust emission in the 12 - 18 @xmath51 m range lie outside of the radio shell ( i.e. to the sw and ne ; fig .",
    "3d ) . in addition to the [ neii ] and [ neiii ] lines in the 12 - 18 @xmath51",
    "m range , @xcite also find a similar distribution for [ feii ] at 1.64 @xmath51 m ( albeit over a smaller field of view encompassing only the south and western parts of the remnant ) .",
    "ionized infrared fine structure lines have also been shown to account for much of the 12 - 25 @xmath51 m emission observed toward the northeast rim of ic  443 ; another snr known to be interacting with a molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "infrared fine structure lines can be easily formed in the cooling post - shock gas after the passage of a dissociating j - type shock with a speed @xmath2 km  s@xmath3 ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , @xcite suggest that since shocked molecular gas as traced by wide co line widths and excited h@xmath52 emission is concentrated near the co peak ( fig .",
    "3c ) , while the ir line emission is much more widespread ( the morphology agrees well with the radio continuum ) , that much of the shock interaction between the snr and molecular must be a dissociative j - type shock .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the lack of mid - ir continuum or hydrocarbon line emission interior to the remnant , since much of the dust would be destroyed in such a shock ( the high abundance of gas phase [ fe ] also implies that most of the dust has been destroyed ) .",
    "thus , the 12 - 18 @xmath51 m emission predominately traces the snr / molecular cloud shock boundaries .",
    "using equation 1 , and the integrated spectral index found in  3.1 of @xmath45 , we derive the following equation for the 74  mhz optical depth as a function of position @xmath53,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the images shown in figures 1a and 1c .",
    "the resulting 74  mhz optical depth map is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the morphology of the @xmath47 map mimics that of the 74/330  mhz spectral index maps shown in figures 1 and 3 .",
    "if the electron temperature is known , the @xmath47 map shown in figure 4 can be converted a map of emission measure ( @xmath56 ) using @xmath57 where @xmath56 is the emission measure , @xmath58 is the electron temperature ( k ) , @xmath59 is the frequency in mhz , and @xmath60 is the gaunt factor and is @xmath61 at the temperatures and densities discussed here @xcite .    in the remainder of this section we use previous observational data toward 3c  391 ( see  4.1 and 4.2 ) to constrain the properties of the free - free absorbing gas .",
    "however , it is important to note that the electron temperature and density ( both electron @xmath62 and total @xmath63 ) will change significantly as a function of distance behind the shock front ( see for example * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "moreover , since we are observing at least some of the shock front `` face - on '' ( see fig 3 ) we are sampling all of these regions along the line of sight simultaneously in a way that can not be disentangled .",
    "thus , it is impossible to uniquely assign any one value to either @xmath58 or @xmath62 . for the remainder of this section we deal only with average or typical values , in order to give a sense of the likely parameter space .    in order to account for the wide range of near infrared , mid - infrared , and molecular lines observed toward 3c  391 ,",

    "@xcite has suggested that the extended envelopes of normal hii regions ( ehes ) might well provide the requisite temperatures and densities .",
    "this suggestion was prompted by the statistical correlation of high and low frequency rrl velocities , indicating that they may arise from the same kinematic regions .",
    "however , it is unclear whether such envelopes extend far enough into the ism to account for a large fraction of the snrs showing low frequency absorption .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggest that galactic `` worms '' may cause absorption toward some sources .",
    "ionized `` worms '' occur when a later generation of massive ob stars ionizes a preexisting superbubble .",
    "indeed , the absorption observed toward the snr w49b by @xcite may be due to such a `` worm '' @xcite .",
    "however , the physical properties of `` worms '' are not currently well determined so it is not clear whether they can account for a large number of snr thermal absorption cases .    _",
    "the free - free absorption observed toward 3c  391 provides the first evidence for another origin : ionized gas produced when a snr blast wave encounters a nearby molecular cloud with sufficient speed to dissociate and ionize the gas .",
    "_ this is an exciting prospect since it implies that the large fields of view afforded by low radio frequency observations may be used to efficiently search for cases of snr / molecular cloud interactions .",
    "thus far only a handful of such cases are known from traditional blind hi and co surveys ( for example w44 , ic443 , w28 , and hb21 , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , despite the fact that it seems plausible that many snrs should still be located in or near their nascent molecular clouds .",
    "oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers , found toward @xmath94 of snrs , have proven to be powerful signposts of snr / molecular cloud interactions @xcite .",
    "a number of new interaction cases have been confirmed by follow - up infrared and mm - wavelength observations of snrs with oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers , including 3c  391 ( also see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , these masers require a very limited set of physical conditions to be pumped ( i.e. slow c - type shocks with @xmath95 k and @xmath96 @xmath10 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that while molecular gas must be present were they are found , non - detection is inconclusive . thus , low frequency",
    "free - free thermal absorption may provide an important complementary tracer of fast ionizing snr / molecular cloud shocks .",
    "unfortunately , since typical hi clouds in the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) only have densities of @xmath97 @xmath10 ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is unlikely that snr / cnm hi clouds interactions would produce observable free - free absorption .",
    "one obvious benefit to be gained by finding more snr / molecular cloud interactions , is that the velocity of the cloud can then be used to derive a kinematic distance for the remnant . in this",
    "regard , radio recombination line detections of the free - free ionized gas would also yield velocity information .",
    "snrs distances are notoriously difficult to obtain although it is a key parameter in most snr diagnostics like physical size , age , and energetics . given the low number of snrs for which accurate distance estimates exist , even a few new free - free absorption driven snr / molecular cloud discoveries would represent a significant gain .",
    "for currently known examples of snr / molecular cloud interaction , free - free absorption also represents an important means of studying the properties of the shock , since only j - type shocks can create the requisite ionized gas .",
    "however , it is also notable that if the free - free absorption observed toward 3c  391 , is common toward snrs with associated molecular clouds , the observation of intrinsic spectral index variation due to shock acceleration will be very difficult to detect at low radio frequencies .",
    "for the first time we have been able to spatially resolve ( at @xmath25 resolution ) the morphology of the low frequency free - free absorption toward 3c  391 , previously inferred from integrated flux measurements . we find that the average 74  mhz optical depth is 1.1 and the spectral index of the snr is @xmath45 .",
    "there is impressive agreement between the regions of strongest 74  mhz free - free absorption and ionized fine structure atomic lines between 12 - 18 @xmath51 m .",
    "this coincidence suggests that the source of ionized thermal gas responsible for the low frequency absorption arises from the snr / molecular cloud shock boundary .",
    "the appropriate range of temperatures and densities to excite the fine structure lines can be easily achieved in the post - shock gas of a j - type shock with a speed of @xmath2 km  s@xmath3 @xcite . using the range of temperatures appropriate for",
    "the infrared ionized fine structure lines of @xmath89 k @xcite we find that the average emission measure of the free - free absorbing gas is @xmath98",
    "@xmath73  pc . from a number of different lines of evidence including the infrared fine structure emission and the observed differential x - ray absorption across 3c  391",
    ", we find that the electron density likely lies between @xmath99 @xmath10 , with a lower range between @xmath85 @xmath10 favored .",
    "a study by @xcite suggested that @xmath7 of all snrs in the galaxy suffer from some degree of low frequency free - free absorption .",
    "it has been proposed that such absorption is due to a _ diffuse _ ( @xmath100 @xmath10 )",
    "ionized component of the ism - possibly the extended envelopes of hii regions .",
    "this new work shows for the first time that such absorption can arise from ionized gas in the post - shock region behind a snr / molecular cloud shock interface .",
    "this result is in direct contrast to the result of @xcite for the snr w49b where the low frequency absorption was shown to be linked to an unrelated kinematic component along the line of sight .",
    "additionally , the electron temperatures ( @xmath101 k ) associated with the thermal ionized gas surrounding 3c391 is lower than the canonical values ( @xmath102 k ) assumed by previous interpretations of thermal ism absorption ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "our result implies that thermal absorption effects towards snr / molecular cloud complexes may be significantly stronger than previously suspected , if j - type shocks are common .",
    "this is only the second case after w49b for which _ extrinsic _ free - free thermal absorption toward an snr has been spatially resolved ( free - free absorption from thermal gas interior to a remnant has also been observed toward casa and the crab ) .",
    "future spatially resolved vla 74  mhz studies toward a larger sample of galactic snrs from our ongoing vla 74  mhz inner galactic plane survey ( @xmath103 to @xmath13 ; brogan et al .",
    "2004 , in prep . ) will be a powerful tool in the search for elusive snr / molecular cloud interactions .",
    "they will also allow us to study the prevalence of the other possible sources of free - free absorption described in  4.4 .",
    "the next generation of low frequency instruments like the long wavelength array ( lwa ) and the low frequency array lofar , with their superior resolution and sensitivity will likely shed even greater light on this phenomenon .",
