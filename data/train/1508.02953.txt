    "the recent impressive experimental progress in tailoring different microscopically controlled quantum objects has prompted increasing interest in correlated systems out of equilibrium .",

    "the theoretical description and understanding of these experiments in particular and of complex strongly correlated systems in general presents major challenges to theoretical solid state physics . for this purpose",
    "different theoretical approaches have been developed .",

    "the only approximation in dmft is the locality of the self - energy , which becomes exact in infinite dimensions , but usually it is a good approximation for two and three spatial dimensions .",
    "the key point of dmft is to map the original problem onto a single impurity anderson model ( siam)@xcite whose parameters are determined self - consistently . for this purpose",
    ", several classes of so - called impurity solvers were developed . among them ,",
    "the most powerful methods are the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) approach@xcite , quantum monte carlo ( qmc)@xcite and exact diagonalization ( ed)@xcite .     and on - site energy @xmath1 , sandwiched between two semi - infinite metallic leads ( blue ) , with on - site energies @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "the hopping between neighboring sites of the correlated layer is @xmath4 , while the one for the left ( right ) lead is @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "hybridization between the left ( right ) lead and the correlated layer is @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "a bias voltage @xmath9 is applied between the leads . ]",
    "prompted by the success of dmft for equilibrium systems , the approach was extended@xcite to deal with time - dependent problems within the nonequilibrium green s function approach originating from the works of kubo@xcite , schwinger@xcite , kadanoff , baym@xcite and keldysh@xcite .",
    "similar to the equilibrium case , also non - equilibrium dmft is based on the solution of an appropriate ( non - equilibrium ) siam . despite the fact that many approaches have been suggested to solve such impurity problems ( see , e.g. refs .  )",
    ", not all of them are suited for non - equilibrium dmft . in addition , many of these are only reliable for short times and can not treat long time behavior and accurately describe the steady state .",
    "therefore , developing a non - perturbative impurity solver , which can treat reliably the steady state behavior of the siam is quite a challenge .",
    "the non - equilibrium approach , that will be presented in this paper , has its root in the exact diagonalization ( ed)-based dmft ( ed - dmft ) . in equilibrium ed - dmft",
    "one replaces the infinite bath by an auxiliary finite non - interacting electronic chain whose parameters are determined by a fit to the dmft hybridization function @xmath10 .",
    "this can not be trivially extended to the steady state situation .",
    "first of all , due to the fact that the auxiliary system is finite , there is no dissipation and a proper steady state is never reached .",
    "an additional technical aspect is that the spectrum of the auxiliary system is discrete and therefore , the fit in real frequencies is problematic . but only in the equilibrium case one can circumvent this problem by introducing a fit in matsubara space .",
    "@xcite a possible solution to these problems was suggested by us in refs .   with an approach which enables direct access to the steady state properties of the correlated impurity problem .",
    "the basic idea is that in addition to a finite number of bath sites coupled to the impurity , as in equilibrium ed , two markovian environments are introduced , which act as particle sink and reservoir .",
    "this auxiliary model represents an open quantum system with dissipative dynamics , which allows to properly describe steady state situations .",
    "the behavior of this auxiliary non - equilibrium impurity problem is described by a lindblad master equation , which can be solved exactly by numerical approaches such as full diagonalization @xcite , non - hermitian krylov space  @xcite or matrix product state ( mps ) methods .",
    "@xcite its solution allows to determine both , the retarded and the keldysh self - energies , which are required by the dmft loop , with high accuracy . here ,",
    "in particular , we apply the krylov space approach of ref . to solve the dmft impurity problem .",
    "this yields a much better accuracy than in ref .  , which allows us to resolve the splitting of the quasi - particle resonance as a function of the bias voltage .",

    "our scheme consists , as outlined in detail in sec .",
    "[ imps ] , in replacing the impurity problem with an auxiliary one , which is as close as possible to the one described by but is exactly solvable by numerical methods . the self - consistent loop is then closed by determining the new value of the self - energy @xmath77 we repeat this procedure until convergence is reached , i.e. until @xmath78 .",
    "@xcite      as already mentioned , the main obstacle of dmft is the solution of the impurity problem .",
    "one widespread approach to approximate its solution for the equilibrium case is ed - dmft , whereby one replaces the infinite bath with an auxiliary finite one .",
    "however , this approach can not be used straightforwardly in a nonequilibrium steady - state case , as this can not be described correctly with a finite number of sites@xcite .",
    "one way to overcome this problem , as some of us already suggested in refs .  , is to introduce , in addition to the finite number @xmath0 of bath sites which are coupled to the impurity in the form of two chain segments , two markovian environments , which can be seen as a particle sink and reservoir , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ auxiliary ] ) .",
    "this makes the impurity model effectively infinitely large , which is necessary in order to be able to reach a steady state .",

    "this is of great advantage for the fit , as discussed below in sec.[convergence ] .    to carry out the self - consistent dmft loop we need to evaluate both the non - interacting and the interacting green s functions of the auxiliary model",

    "[ current_vs_phi ] , in this case ( @xmath152 ) the current displays , as expected , a metallic behavior , i.e. a linear increase of the current for small voltages .",

    "the difference between the two situations is that in the case of the single impurity model the resonance and the hubbard subbands are clearly separated .",
    "in contrast , for the correlated layer and for the set of parameters considered here , when the isolated correlated layer is metallic , they overlap due to the broadening induced by the hopping @xmath4 within the correlated layer . and indeed if we artificially reduce @xmath4 to @xmath184 ( keeping all other parameters fixed ) we observe , for @xmath185 a resonance , which is clearly separated from the hubbard subbands ( cf . fig .  [ resonance_splitting ] ) .",
    "in this case , the isolated layer would be insulating and the broadening of the resonance is not any more due to @xmath4 , but to an effective energy scale @xmath186 , which can be seen as a kondo temperature .",
    "this originates from a combination of coherent scattering from the leads into the insulating layer , as well as from a self - consistent dmft process as discussed in ref .  .",
    "in addition to the broadening mentioned above there is also a spurious broadening due to the limited accuracy of our calculation .",

    "notice that in order to resolve the kondo peak and its splitting at low bias we need to use an auxiliary system with @xmath64 . while this allows to resolve the peaks , the limited accuracy makes them broader than they should be and therefore the friedel sum rule is not satisfied even for equilibrium .",
    "the reason for this is that a spurious broadening originating from the limitation of our approach reduces the height of the peak at the fermi level .",
    "@xcite to fulfill this one would have to use more bath sites , and consequently adopt a matrix - product state based solution of the auxiliary system , as we did in ref .",
    "for the anderson impurity model .",
    "this , however , in combination with the dmft self - consistency , would increase considerably the required computation time .",
    "next we study the dependence on the hubbard interaction @xmath11 in more detail .",
    "results for equilibrium ( @xmath191 ) , low ( @xmath176 ) and high ( @xmath177 ) bias voltages are presented in fig .",
    "[ aomega_fix_phi ] . as one can see , in the equilibrium case for large @xmath11 only small excitations are visible at @xmath182 . here",
    "the friedel sum rule would require the @xmath182 peak to display a @xmath11-independent height .",
    "@xcite however , as discussed above for large @xmath11 our approach can not resolve @xmath192 and the peak becomes strongly suppressed , and for intermediate @xmath11 the sum rule is not satisfied , as for fig .",
    "[ aomega_u12_lbv ] . still , fig .",
    "[ aomega_fix_phi](a ) displays a crossover from a regime in which the local fermi liquid peak is already present in the isolated correlated layer ( for @xmath11 below the 2d mott transition ) , into a kondo - fermi liquid regime in which the peak is produced by coherent spin - flip processes across the mott insulator , originating from the fermi levels of the leads . outside of the kondo regime ,",
    "the behavior is qualitatively similar in the three cases . in the non - equilibrium cases , upon increasing the interaction the height of the spectral function at @xmath182 decreases and for @xmath193 the spectral function displays a local minimum at @xmath182 instead of a maximum , which becomes vanishingly small with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "comparison of figs .",
    "[ aomega_phi3.5 ] and [ aomega_phi15 ] shows that for higher bias voltages this resonance disappears at smaller @xmath11 .",
    "also , for higher bias voltages ( @xmath194 ) the non - interacting spectral function has a sharper peak at @xmath182 .",
    "this is due to the fact that for high bias voltage the leads density of states do not overlap any more and correspondingly states close to the fermi level do not dissipate any more into the leads , therefore the density of states close to the fermi level is just the two dimensional density of states , which features a logarithmic divergence .",
    "another effect , clearly visible in figs .",
    "[ aomega_phi0 ] ,  [ aomega_phi3.5 ] and [ aomega_phi15 ] , is the linear shift of the position of the hubbard subbands with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "the peak position is given by @xmath195 .",
    "we have presented an improved application of a dmft technique for non - equilibrium situations that allows to study directly steady state properties of strongly correlated devices . like in equilibrium dmft ,",
    "the only approximation is the locality of the self - energy , while the accuracy of the non - equilibrium impurity problem is controlled by the number of bath sites @xmath0 which are attached to lindblad environments .",
    "we find that the accuracy increases exponentially with @xmath0 , both in and out of equilibrium .",
    "the approach is benchmarked for a strongly correlated layer coupled to two metallic leads . while the results in ref .   for this model were obtained by full diagonalisation of the auxiliary impurity problem and were , thus , restricted to @xmath161 , here we invoked the non - hermitian krylov - space method , which allows us to use larger values for @xmath0 .    with the krylov - space solver we were able to go up to @xmath64 .",
    "for more bath sides ( up to @xmath196 ) the mps solver  @xcite could be used , but the krylov - space solver has the advantage to be quicker and more flexible , which is important for the dmft iteration . for the single layer device studied here we found that @xmath166 already yields very reliable results in most parameter cases .",
    "only the kondo regime requires larger values for @xmath0 , but with @xmath64 at least semi - quantitative results can be achieved .",
    "we have investigated the current - voltage characteristics across a correlated layer . at low bias voltages ,",
    "we have observed a linear behavior for weak interactions , while the current was exponentially suppressed for strong interactions .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , for higher bias voltages we have observed a reversed picture , whereby the current is larger in the strongly interacting case .",
    "in addition we have investigated the current @xmath197 as a function of the local hubbard interaction for low as well as for high bias voltages . for lower bias voltages we found that the @xmath197 decreases monotonically with @xmath11 ,",
    "while for higher bias voltages , the current first increases , reaches its maximum and then decreases again .",
    "the origin of this behavior can be explained by different scattering processes .",
    "in addition to the current we have also investigated the steady state spectral function .",
    "our results show that for the set of parameters considered in this manuscript , the spectral function is only weakly dependent on the bias voltage in contrast to the single impurity problem .",
    "this is due to the fact that the splitting of the kondo resonance as a function of @xmath19 is strongly broadened due to the hopping within the correlated layer . as to be expected , the hubbard satellites depend almost linearly on @xmath11 , like in the equilibrium case .",
    "we thank markus aichhorn , michael knap and martin nuss for valuable discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the austrian science fund ( fwf ) : p24081 , p26508 , as well as sfb - vicom project f04103 , and nawi graz .",
