    "the solid lines are the least - squares fits of the differential extinction models , and the bottom panels show the final reduced light curves after dividing out these systematics .",
    "fts of these fully reduced light curves , and those from all other runs on these targets , do not reveal significant signals to our @xmath67 significance threshold ( see section  [ sec : j1735 ] ) .",
    "we place conservative limits on possible pulsation amplitudes and periods that may be present in these objects in table  [ tab : limits ] . since we impose a careful requirement of considering at least two multi - hour light curves before designating a star as not observed to vary ( nov ) , we do not provide limits for sdssj1518 + 1354 , the only target in our sample that was observed on only one night .",
    "for the others , we base our quoted limits on the two longest light curves for each object alone , claiming that no pulsations are present with periods shorter than the second - longest observing run and amplitudes greater than the largest @xmath67 threshold value in the ft of either run .",
    "it is worth noting that a peak in the ft of the combined runs on sdssj1017 + 1217 from 30 apr and 03 may 2016 exceeds a lower @xmath113 level , and we consider this feature with period @xmath114min and amplitude @xmath115mma suggestive .",
    "additional observations of any of these targets could reveal lower amplitude or longer timescale variations .",
    "in our search for photometric variability from nine candidate pulsating elm wds , we identified significant signals in five targets .",
    "however , the observed properties of some of these targets are not in agreement with the elm wd classification .",
    "since elm wds can only form through mass transfer in close binary systems , we expect to be able to measure orbital rv variations for these stars , except in very few nearly face - on ( @xmath116 ) cases .",
    "* section 3.4 ) determine that the total 11 non - rv - variable objects ( 8 with @xmath0  @xmath117 k ) out of 78 targets with @xmath118 catalogued in the elm survey likely represents an overabundance to a 2.5@xmath119 significance compared with expectations from a random distribution of orbital orientations .",
    "this suggests that some of these non - rv - variable objects may not be bona fide elm wds .    for one of the non - rv - variable elm wd candidates , sdssj1355 + 1956",
    ", we measure an exceptionally long dominant pulsation period of @xmath120 hours . following @xcite",
    ", we calculate the approximate theoretical maximum allowed nonradial gravity mode pulsation period of @xmath121min for a wd with the published spectroscopic parameters of this target , assuming an eddington gray atmosphere .",
    "the observed pulsations greatly exceed this theoretical limit for surface reflection in a wd , providing additional evidence that this star is individually a false positive in the elm survey .",
    "this strongly supports that sdssj1355 + 1956 is not a wd , and its actual surface gravity is likely less than the spectroscopically determined value @xmath1  @xmath122 . with the dominant mode amplitude reaching 41.51 mma , we are likely observing pressure - mode pulsations in a high - amplitude @xmath2 scuti  a class of pulsating star typically found in the range @xmath123 k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , recent analysis of the hot , lead - rich subdwarf uvo 0825 + 15 by @xcite provides compelling evidence for pulsation periods that exceed the @xcite limit , casting some doubt on the robustness of this theoretical result .",
    "given the large amplitude and the upper limit on rv semi - amplitude from elm7 of @xmath124 km s@xmath65 , the observed variability can not be attributed to ellipsoidal variations of an elm wd @xcite .    of the remaining pulsating candidate elm wd variables ,",
    "only four out of eight show rv variations in time series spectroscopy : sdss j184037.78 + 642312.3 @xcite , sdss j111215.82 + 111745.0 , sdss j151826.68 + 065813.2 @xcite , and psr j1738 + 0333 @xcite .",
    "the two other new pulsating stars described in this work are not rv variables , as is the case for the previously published pulsators sdss j161431.28 + 191219.4 and sdss j222859.93 + 362359.6 @xcite .",
    "it is unknown whether another claimed elmv ",
    "sdss j161831.69 + 385415.15 @xcite that was identified as an elm candidate from sdss spectroscopy @xcite  is rv variable .",
    "we submit that none of these non - rv - variable pulsating stars have been conclusively shown to be elmvs .",
    "some could be in nearly face - on binary systems , but when we simulate random binary orientations , we find the probability of four out of eight systems with @xmath125 to be @xmath126 .",
    "@xcite found thousands of objects with sdss dr12 spectra that are consistent with elm wds that they call `` sdas , '' with the elm classification requiring confirmation of rv variations .",
    "the sdas are strongly concentrated around @xmath0  @xmath127 k , which is where the da wd instability strip extends through the elm regime .",
    "there is no evolutionary scenario that predicts such an abundance of elm wds at this temperature , which may highlight an inaccuracy in current spectroscopic models or their application .",
    "we suspect that sdssj1355 + 1956 and some of our other non - rv - variable pulsating stars are actually members of this sda class . this does imply that the sdas also pulsate in or near the same region of spectroscopic parameter space , revealing the potential for distinguishing between sdas and elm wds asteroseismically .",
    "we depict the present landscape of wd pulsations in @xmath1@xmath0  space in figure  [ fig : loggteff ] .",
    "we distinguish confirmed elmvs ( yellow diamonds ) from pulsating candidate elm wds without measured rv variations ( squares ) .",
    "the black square corresponds to sdssj1355 + 1956 , with a much longer pulsation period than expected from an elm wd .",
    "the white square is sdss j161831.69 + 385415.15 @xcite , which does not have available time series spectroscopy . the symbols representing objects analyzed in this work are outlined with bold black borders .",
    "we include novs with limits on pulsational variability ( @xmath62 ) , more massive zz ceti variables ( triangles ) , and pulsating pre - elms ( orange narrow diamonds ) for context .",
    "the empirical bounds of the da instability strip from @xcite are marked with dashed lines .",
    "if we redefine these boundaries based on only the confirmed elmvs , we find a more narrow extension of the strip to low @xmath1 .",
    "we also observe variability from photometric binaries in our sample .",
    "partial coverage of the 19.342-hour binary period of wd j0308 + 5140 reveals evidence of eclipses . the lower limit on the primary star radius of @xmath85 @xmath4  is inconsistently large compared with the maximum expected radius for a cooling elm wd .",
    "the evolutionary models of @xcite give a maximum cooling - track radius of @xmath590.13 @xmath4 , while the @xcite models find a maximum of @xmath590.17 @xmath4 .",
    "however , the models with element diffusion enabled show that some elm wds can temporarily become much larger during cno flashes as they settle onto their final cooling tracks ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and previous works referenced therein ) . _ kepler _ photometry of the eclipsing system kic 10657664 has demonstrated empirically that elm wds can be at least as large as @xmath128 @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "additional photometry of wd j0308 + 5140 would provide some of the first precise constraints on the physical properties of sda stars .",
    "the presence of this false positive in the elm survey cautions that binary confirmation alone is not sufficient to positively identify an elm wd .",
    "the properties of wdj0308 + 5140 are similar to another eclipsing system , sdss j160036.83 + 272117.8 , which was not included in the elm6 sample due to eclipse durations that were inconsistent with the elm wd classification ( * ? ? ? * in prep . ) . only binary rv periods short enough to preclude non - degenerate stellar components ( @xmath129hr ) , or those with supporting data as photometric binaries , should be interpreted as elm wds with confidence .",
    "the other binary that we observe photometric variations of , sdssj1054@xmath52121 , is just such a case .",
    "the ellipsoidal variation signature of @xmath130% amplitude is entirely consistent with that expected for a double - degenerate binary with an elm wd primary . in future work",
    ", we will use the measured ellipsoidal variability amplitude to significantly improve our physical constraints on this system .",
    "we identified nine candidate pulsating elm wds from the elm survey papers vi and vii .",
    "each of these targets has spectroscopically determined @xmath0  and @xmath1  values that place them within 500 k of the empirical low - mass extension of the da wd instability strip , which overlaps the population of sda stars with @xmath131 k. we obtained time series photometry of these systems from mcdonald observatory , most over many nights .",
    "* fourier analysis reveals that three targets  sdssj1355 + 1956 , sdssj1735 + 2134 , and sdss j2139 + 2227show significant pulsational variability .",
    "however , since these targets are among the few for which time series spectroscopy from elm7 did not show the rv variations that are expected from an elm wd , we do not consider them confirmed elmvs .",
    "* in particular , sdssj1355 + 1956 pulsates with a dominant period of @xmath120 hours , far exceeding the theoretical limit for pulsations in a wd .",
    "this is likely a @xmath2 scuti variable with an overestimated @xmath1  from spectroscopic model fits . * a total of 4 out of 8 other pulsating variable stars in the parameter space of elm wds",
    "do not show significant rv variations in time series spectroscopy .",
    "there is less than a 0.0008 probability that these are all nearly face - on ( @xmath125 ) binaries .",
    "some of these targets are likely sda stars  a stellar population revealed in recent sdss data releases @xcite of unclear nature . *",
    "our data on wdj0308 + 5140 reveal evidence for a deep @xmath594hr eclipse , implying that the primary star has radius @xmath132 @xmath4 .",
    "this is not consistent with an elm wd and demonstrates that a mere detection of rv variations is not sufficient to make this classification , though very short period binaries may exclude other classes .",
    "* ellipsoidal variation and doppler beaming amplitudes measured in sdss j1054@xmath52121 are consistent with the elm wd classification for this object .",
