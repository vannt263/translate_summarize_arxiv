    "in this work , we wish to reconsider the theory of regge poles @xcite in the context of the ads / cft duality @xcite .",

    ", we shall show how to resum multi ",
    "reggeon interactions in the eikonal limit , using an impact parameter representation for cft amplitudes developed in @xcite .",
    "we take as an example @xmath5 @xmath7 supersymmetric yang ",
    "mills theory in @xmath6 at large t hooft coupling , where the gravi  reggeon pole corresponds dually to the pomeron trajectory @xcite .",
    "we analyze the leading string corrections to pure graviton exchange , following @xcite .",
    "recall that , due to the presence of a time  like boundary , the ads analogue of the flat space scattering matrix computes correlators @xmath8 in the dual cft .",
    "moreover , the role played in flat space scattering by external particle momenta is now played by the boundary points @xmath9 in the dual correlator .",
    "this interplay of ads momenta  and cft positions is at the heart of the simplicity of regge theory for cft s in position space . in particular , we shall focus our attention on the ads analogue of @xmath10 scattering in flat space , which computes the conformal field theory correlator @xmath11 where the operators @xmath1 are scalar primaries . in analogy with a flat space scattering process , we shall consider the operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 to be dual to incoming states , whereas @xmath14 and @xmath15 will be dual to outgoing ones .",
    "accordingly , we shall denote with s and t  channel the limits where @xmath16 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "let us first recall the situation in flat space scattering . at high energy ,",
    "interactions are dominated by the partial wave of highest spin @xmath17 exchanged in the t ",
    "channel , with a characteristic growth of the amplitude given by @xmath18 . whenever partial waves of all spins are present , the high energy limit of the amplitude must be determined with the aid of a sommerfeld ",
    "watson transform in the complex @xmath17plane , which leads directly to regge theory .",
    "level string theory in flat space is a paradigmatic example of this behavior , where massive higher spin interactions resum to an effective gravi  reggeon pole with high energy behavior @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , in this case , higher loop string interactions can be resummed in the eikonal limit @xcite at large transverse distances .",
    "this is achieved by determining the phase shift using the impact parameter representation of the leading tree level gravi  reggeon amplitude .",
    "consider now the situation in conformal field theory . in the euclidean regime of the cft ,",
    "the correlator ( [ i100 ] ) is determined , in the t ",
    "channel @xmath2 , by the usual operator product expansion and is therefore dominated by conformal partial waves of lowest energy .",
    "the situation is therefore rather different from the analogous flat space @xmath10 s ",
    "matrix amplitude , where highest exchanged spin dominates . on the other hand",
    ", if we consider the cft amplitude in a specific lorentzian kinematical regime , the situation is analogous to a flat space s  matrix @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we shall consider the situation where @xmath20 is in the future of @xmath21 and @xmath22 is in the future of @xmath23 , with @xmath24 spacelike related to @xmath25 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this kinematics corresponds , dually , to a true @xmath10 scattering process in ads and the limit @xmath2 of a t  channel partial wave of spin @xmath17 now behaves as @xmath26 . as in",
    "flat space , highest spins now dominate .",
    "when the amplitude contains intermediate conformal partial waves of all spins @xmath17 , its limiting form for @xmath2 must be analyzed by resumming all contributions in the complex @xmath17plane . in this paper",
    ", we show how to perform the relevant analytic continuation in the complex @xmath17plane and how to extract the leading behavior of the lorentzian amplitude in the limit @xmath2 . in section [ secregge ]  we shall describe , in particular , the behavior of the amplitude @xmath3 when it is dominated by a leading regge pole in the @xmath17plane .",
    "the pole is described by a trajectory @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the ads analogue of transverse momentum transfer .",
    "more precisely , @xmath28 parameterizes the spectral decomposition of the laplacian operator on the relevant transverse space , which turns out to be the hyperbolic space @xmath29 , independently of the existence of a gravity ads dual @xcite .",
    "finally , in section [ seceikonal ] , we consider theories which admit a string dual description .",
    "the string tree level contribution @xmath4 to the full amplitude will then be dominated , in the t ",
    "channel , by a leading regge pole , which corresponds to gravi  reggeon exchange in ads .",
    "we then analyze multi ",
    "reggeon exchanges in the limit @xmath30 using eikonal techniques .",
    "this is easily achieved using the relevant impact parameter representation for the tree ",
    "level amplitude @xmath4 , which was developed in @xcite and which determines the leading contribution to the phase shift . under the assumption that the phase shift is determined only by the leading tree contribution for large impact parameters",
    ", we are able to resum the contributions of multi  reggeon exchanges , neglecting self  interactions , as in flat space @xcite .    as an example of the general formalism ,",
    "we conclude , in section [ secexample ] , with the discussion of the gravi  reggeon trajectory @xmath31 dual to the pomeron trajectory of @xmath5 @xmath7 supersymmetric yang  mills theory in @xmath6 .",
    "we analyze the leading string corrections to the trajectory at large t hooft coupling , quickly rederiving the results of @xcite .",

    "pomeron exchanges at large t hooft coupling in the large impact parameter limit .",
    "we will extend this analysis to the weak t hooft coupling regime in @xcite .",
    "note added : as this work was being completed , a paper appeared @xcite which contains some overlapping results .",
    "the results in this paper have been presented at the ggi workshop `` string and m theory approaches to particle physics and cosmology '' , may 2007 , at the 3rd rtn workshop , valencia 15 october 2007 and at centro e. fermi on september 5th , 2007 .",

    "the @xmath141 limit of the lorentzian amplitude is then much richer in structure then the corresponding limit of the euclidean amplitude .",
