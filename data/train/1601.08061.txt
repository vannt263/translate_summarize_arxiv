    "nowadays , great attention is paid to both experimental and theoretical studies of the @xmath8 transition form factor .",
    "this interest is mainly due to the problem of calculating the hadronic light - by - light contribution to the value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty of this contribution is responsible for a sizable part of the uncertainty of the @xmath9 calculation .",
    "experimental data on the form factors needed for development of phenomenological models are derived from measurements of two - photon @xmath10 production @xmath11 , two - photon and conversion decays @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , and the radiative process @xmath15 .",
    "investigations of these processes are planned in various experiments ( belle-2 , bes - iii , kloe - ii , snd , cmd-3 ) .    from analysis of the @xmath16 data in the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model ,",
    "the widths of radiative decays of vector mesons can be extracted .",
    "the values of these probabilities for low - lying vector resonances @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are widely used in phenomenological models , in particular , to fix their quark content .",
    "the radiative decays of the excited states of light mesons have been studied very badly .",
    "since these probabilities are sensitive to the quark content of the mesons , their measurements are important to search for exotic states ( glueballs , hybrid mesons ) , which are predicted in the mass range between 1 and 2 gev .",
    "the most accurate studies of the process @xmath16 were performed in experiments at the vepp-2 m @xmath1 collider with the snd  @xcite and cmd-2  @xcite detectors . from these data ,",
    "only @xmath20 decay has been measured with a relatively high accuracy .",
    "the combined snd and cmd-2 result on the product @xmath21 has an uncertainty of 2.6% .",
    "however , the value of this product differs by 7% from that calculated using @xmath22 and @xmath23 given in the particle data group ( pdg ) table  @xcite .",
    "this difference is caused by existing contradictions between the measured values of @xmath21 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the two latter parameters have accuracies of 1.6% and 1.8% , respectively , and determine the current pdg value of @xmath22 . to resolve or enhance this contradiction ,",
    "it is necessary to improve the accuracy of the @xmath26 cross - section measurement near the @xmath6-resonance peak .",
    "the accuracy of the @xmath27 branching fraction ( 13% ) is determined by statistics of existing measurements .",
    "the formal accuracy of the pdg value for the @xmath28 branching fraction is better than 5% .",
    "this pdg value is obtained by averaging the measurements  @xcite with a systematic error of about 8% each .",
    "the systematic error arises from the uncertainty in the nonresonant amplitude interfering with the amplitude of the @xmath28 decay .",
    "the nonresonant amplitude is determined by the tails of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 resonances , as well as by the contributions of higher excitations of the vector resonances . to reduce this systematic error ,",
    "it is necessary to improve the accuracy of the @xmath26 cross section in the wide energy range , from 0.6 up to at least 1.4 gev .",
    "it should be noted that the published snd results are based on about 25% of data collected at vepp-2 m . in this work the full data sample recorded by snd at vepp-2 m is used to measure the @xmath26 cross section in the energy range from 0.6 to 1.4 gev .",
    "snd  @xcite is a general - purpose non - magnetic detector . in the period from 1996 to 2000",
    "it collected data at the vepp-2 m @xmath1 collider  @xcite .",
    "the main part of the detector is a spherical three - layer calorimeter containing 1640 individual nai(tl ) crystals .",
    "the calorimeter covers a solid angle of 95% of @xmath29 ; its thickness for particles coming from the collider interaction region is @xmath30 .",
    "the calorimeter energy resolution for photons is @xmath31{e_\\gamma({\\rm gev)}}$ ] , the angular resolution @xmath32 .",
    "directions of charged particles are measured by a system of two cylindrical drift chambers . outside the calorimeter",
    "a muon detector is located , which consists of plastic scintillation counters and streamer tubes . in this analysis",
    "the muon detector is used as a cosmic - ray veto .    the analysis presented in this paper",
    "is based on snd data with an integrated luminosity of 26 pb@xmath33 collected in 19972000 in the c.m .",

    "the isovector and isoscalar contributions into the @xmath47 above 1.06 gev may be estimated from the @xmath48 and @xmath49 cross sections using the vmd model . in the energy region 1.06",
    "- 1.40 gev both contributions are found to be several tens of pb , in reasonable agreement with the experimentally observed @xmath47 cross section .",
    "it is impossible to separate contributions to the @xmath47 from the @xmath50 and @xmath51 resonances , and from the @xmath52 and @xmath53 resonances .",
    "therefore , in the fit we use two effective resonances ( below we will name them @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) with masses and widths of ( 1450,400 ) mev and ( 1700,300 ) mev . the uncertainties of these parameters are assumed to be ( 50,50 ) mev .",

    "@xmath57 phase space ( dominant for the @xmath50 ) , and the phase space for the @xmath51 , which is a sum of the @xmath58(56% ) , @xmath59(37% ) , @xmath60(3% ) , and @xmath61(4% ) contributions  @xcite . in the nominal fit the energy dependence of the @xmath54 width",

    "the latter parameter is a difference between the fitted @xmath18-mass value and the value obtained by snd  @xcite in the process @xmath75 on data of the 1998 and 2000 scans .",
    "the @xmath18 width is fixed at the value from the same ref .",
    "the mass and width for the @xmath19 are taken from the snd work  @xcite , in which data of the 1998 @xmath56-meson scan were used to study the processes @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",

    "the following values of fitted parameters are obtained : @xmath81 the first error is statistical and the second is systematic . for the cross sections , the systematic uncertainty includes the uncertainty of luminosity determination ( 1.2% ) , the uncertainty of the detection efficiency ( 0.6% for @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) , and uncertainties associated with the model of the @xmath54 energy - dependent width and inaccuracies of the resonance masses and widths .",
    "it should be noted that a systematic uncertainty on @xmath68 is determined by the errors of the luminosity and detection efficiency , and weakly depends on other sources .",
    "the main contribution to the @xmath67 systematic uncertainty comes from inaccuracy of @xmath82 .",

    ". the fitted shift of the @xmath6 mass relative to the snd measurement in the @xmath75 process  @xcite is consistent with zero .",
