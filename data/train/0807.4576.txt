    "as a very recent development , the possibility of unambiguous discrimination between unknown quantum states can be potentially useful for many applications in quantum computing and quantum communications .",
    "the problem of unambiguous discriminating pure states , which are successfully identified with nonunit probability but witout error , was originally formulated and analyzed by ivanovic , dicks and peres [ 1 - 3 ] in 1987 .",
    "later , jeager and shimony solved the question of unambiguous discrimination of two known pure states with arbitrary @xmath22 probability . shortly after this result",
    ", chefles proved that only linearly independent pure states can be unambiguously discriminated [ 5 ] .",
    "the problem of discrimination among three nonorthogonal states was first considered by peres and terno [ 6 ] , and the same question has also been discussed by duan and guo[7 ] and sun @xmath23 [ 8 ] .",
    "chefles and barnett also provided the optimal failure probability and it s corresponding optimal measurement for a n symmetric states [ 9 ] , and an experimental set for discriminating four linearly independent nonorthogonal symmetric states was given by jimnez @xmath24 [ 10 ] .",
    "a new strategy for optimal unambiguous discrimination of quantum states was also offered by jafarizadeh @xmath23 [ 11 ] .",
    "unambiguous discrimination involving mixed state or a set of pure states , became an object of research recently .",
    "several necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimum measurement have been given by zhang @xmath23 [ 12 ] and eldar @xmath23 [ 13 ] .",
    "reduction theorems , which can simplify the discrimination theorem , have been developed by raynal @xmath23 [ 14 - 15 ] .",
    "low bounds for the failure and the conditions for saturating the boumds , have also been studied [ 16 - 20 ] .",
    "there are only a few special cases have analytical solution for the quantum measurement , for examples , the quantum state filtering [ 21 - 23 ] , two mixtures with orthogonal or one - dimensional kernels [ 14 - 15 ] , two mixtures in the jordan basis [ 24 ] and other cases [ 26 - 30 ) .    in present work",
    ", we shall present a new scheme to solve the problem of quantum state unambiguous discrimination .",
    "let s use the quantum state filtering originated from [ 21 - 23 ] , as an example , to show the basic idea of present scheme .",
    "suppose there are n linearly independent states , the task of the quantum state filtering can be viewed as to find a set of operators @xmath25 , whose elements are defined by : @xmath26 , @xmath27 with @xmath28 , and @xmath29 corresponds to fail .",
    "if we are able to find a ( n+1)-dimensional unitary transformation , @xmath0 with @xmath1 is an adjustable variable(s ) , which will be performed on each @xmath2 in the way like : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , then , according to the definition of the operators , there should be : @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , with this @xmath8 in hands , we could find the optimal operators which lets the function @xmath9 , with @xmath10 to be the @xmath11 probability of @xmath12 , have it s minimal value .    for the system with n=3 , there are three types of operations : ( a ) @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 corresponds to fail ; ( b ) @xmath16 if @xmath17 for i=1,2,3 , and @xmath18 for failure ; and ( c ) @xmath19 @xmath20 while @xmath21 we shall show that all these three types of operators , which may be performed on a n=3 systems , can be get by applying argument of filtering : the case a is in fact the filtering with n=3 , case b can be viewed as successive filtering and the case c can also be solved by an argument of filtering in subspace .",
    "it looks as if each case , which belongs to the above three , can be solved by reducing it to the problem of filtering .",
    "an important case of n=4 system , has also been discussed .",
    "our present paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is a preliminary section in which we introduce the so - called double - triangle representation . in section iii",
    ", we shall give a different way of solving the question of quantum states filtering .",
    "a concept of filtering in subspace will be introduced in sec.iv .",
    "two examples , discriminating three pure states and discriminating two mixtures for n=4 , will be discussed in section v and vi , respectively . in sec.vii",
    ", we conclude the paper with a short summary .     an optical setting to realize the povms in an enlarged hilbert space ]",
    "considering a quantum system prepared in one of n pure quantum states @xmath33 , where j=1 , 2 , ... , n , if the states are non - orthogonal , no quantum operations can deterministically discriminate them .",
    "it is , however , possible to device a strategy reveal the state with zero error probability under the condition that these states are linearly independent [ 5 ] . employing the kraus representation of quantum operations [ 31 ] ,",
    "each of the possible distinguishable outcomes of an operation is associated with linear transformation operators @xmath34 , @xmath35 with @xmath36 leads to failure while @xmath37 corresponds to the discrimination of @xmath12 . by introducing the @xmath38 @xmath39 , which is defined as that which lies in @xmath40 , the n - dimensional hilbert space for the n linearly independent states @xmath12 , and is orthogonal to all @xmath41 for @xmath42",
    ", chefles found that [ 5 ] @xmath43 where @xmath44 form an orthonormal basis for @xmath45 while @xmath46 is the conditional probability , given that the system was prepared in the state @xmath12 , that this state will be identified , @xmath47 in the terms of positive operator valued measures ( povms ) [ 31 ] , the measurement can be expressed by defining the positive hermitian operators @xmath48 with @xmath49 , and it has been shown that the optimum measurement corresponds to the maximum eigenvalue of value of @xmath50 being equal to 1 [ 5 ] .",
    "let @xmath51 for j=1 , 2 , ... , n , the povms given above can viewed as one type of operations on g. there may be other types of operations on the same g , for example , if there are two known groups of states , @xmath52 for k=1 , 2 , ... , k , and @xmath53 for l= l , l+1 , ... , n , @xmath54 and @xmath55 may have common elements if @xmath56 , we could also define a new set of povms @xmath57 for i=1 , 2 , @xmath58 can unambiguously tell whether a state @xmath59 belongs to @xmath60 or not .",
    "now , one may ask the question : could this @xmath25 also be expressed in terms of @xmath61 ? we shall give an answer to this question . according to the neumark s theorem [ 32 ] : if each @xmath62 is an one dimensional positive operator , @xmath63 can always be realized by extending the hilbert space to a larger space and performing orthogonal measurement in the larger space , while , as we shall shown , we are able to realize the discrimination of the quantum states just according to the definition of the operators , this fact makes it possible to read @xmath64 from their corresponding projective operators in the enlarged space .",
    "we shall show how this basic idea works via the aid of fig.1 : the total space is defined to be @xmath65 with @xmath66 , i=1 , 2 , ... , n , and j=1 , 2 , ... , m , for it s `` in - space '' while @xmath67 for it s `` out - space '' with @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and n+m = k+l .",

    "let s use @xmath1 to denote the adjustable parameter(s ) in the unitary transformation , we can define @xmath73 and express it in the `` out - space '' @xmath74 with the normalization constraint @xmath75 if we want to unambiguously discriminate all @xmath76 in g , we should find the general @xmath77 which gives @xmath78 then , @xmath79 and @xmath80 should be the projective operator corresponds to @xmath81 and @xmath29 , respectively . with the @xmath77",

    "there should be @xmath86 and @xmath87 . with these operators in hands",
    ", we could get both the optimal operators and the maximum values for discriminating @xmath33 .",

    "if we could define @xmath89 by @xmath90 at the beginning , then we shall be able to complete the task of expressing @xmath62 in terms of @xmath91 .",
    "the argument above can also be generalized to other cases with different operations on g.    in present works , we always adopt the proposals originated from the works by sun @xmath92 [ 8 ] : ( a ) any pure state can be realized by a single - photon state and ( b ) , according to reck s theorem [ 34 ] , any unitary transformation matrix can also be realized by an optical network consisting of beam - splitters , phase - shifters , @xmath93 , all these optical elements should construct an one - photon interferometer ( opi ) . the device in fig.2",

    ", all these cases can be solved by reducing to filtering . for the cases where more than",
    "once filtering is needed , it s hard for us to find analytical solutions for the optical values .    a important profit of our scheme should be mentioned here : the povms for each case shall be able to , although maybe not in a optimal way , complete the task of discriminating when the _ a priori _ probability of each state is not completely decided .    in end of this paper",
    ", we would like to emphasize that : first , for a given case , if one could prepare the input in the one - photon state , then our opi can be directly used for the optical experimental realization . then , although the povms are from the one - photon picture , yet they are are general and state - type independent .",
    "finally , a proposal , rather than a complete proof , has been given here in order to find a solution to the problem of the quantum state unambiguous discrimination .",
