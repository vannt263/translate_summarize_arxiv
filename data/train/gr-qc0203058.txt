    "in reference @xcite barrett and crane introduced a very interesting model of riemannian quantum gravity based on a constrained state - sum .",
    "the definition of the model can be nicely motivated by geometrical properties of the so - called ` quantum tetrahedron ' .",
    "the definition of the quantum tetrahedron in 3 dimensions was originally introduced by barbieri in @xcite .",
    "baez and barrett showed that a generalization to 4 dimensions naturally leads to the the barrett - crane ( bc ) model @xcite .",
    "evidence suggesting that the model corresponds to a discrete path integral for general relativity has been found in @xcite .",
    "the model turns out to be well defined on a finite ( non - degenerate ) triangulation once an appropriate normalization is chosen@xcite .",
    "this normalization arises naturally in the so - called group field theory ( gft ) formulation @xcite , which in addition provides a prescription for summing over discretizations .",
    "the model has been extended to the lorentzian sector in @xcite .",
    "the finiteness properties are preserved in this extension@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 plebanski action corresponds to the @xmath0 bf action plus certain lagrange multiplier terms imposing constraints on the @xmath1 field .",
    "therefore , one can formally quantize the theory restricting the bf - path - integral to paths that satisfy the b - field constraints . in the literature",
    ", there is an implicit assumption that the bc model corresponds to a realization of this idea . in other words ,",
    "the definition of the quantum tetrahedron in 4d ( giving rise to the bc model ) is sometimes regarded as an alternative way to impose the required restrictions on the b - configurations in the discretization .",
    "the purpose of this work is to analyze if this is the case by systematically carrying out this restrictions .",
    "we will present a construction which defines the path integral of plebanski s action on a fixed simplicial decomposition of space - time .",
    "as just mentioned , this is done by appropriately restricting the state - sum of the @xmath0 bf theory .",
    "the path - integral of the bf theory is defined on a triangulation using techniques similar to those in lattice - gauge theory .",
    "the spin - foam formulation or state - sum is obtained by performing the mode expansion of certain distributions on @xmath0 .",
    "this is analogous to a fourier transform where modes correspond to unitary irreducible representations of @xmath0 ( peter - weyl theorem ) .",
    "the constraints on the b - field in the classical action can be naturally translated into restrictions on these modes .",
    "the definition of these constraints is not different in spirit from that of barrett and crane .",
    "however , we emphasize the requirement that the restrictions should be imposed on configurations of the bf theory . after making some natural definitions",
    ", a systematic derivation leads to a model that is closely related to the bc model but that does not agree with it .",
    "this new version has a puzzling feature : states of 3-geometries ( boundary spin - network states ) are annihilated by the volume operator .",
    "the point of view is related to that of reisenberger and freidel - krasnov in @xcite .",
    "no obvious modification of the prescription can lead to all the bc configurations .    in order to find a possible interpretation of this result we concentrate on one of the degenerate sectors of plebanski s action described in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that one can define a spin foam quantum model corresponding to this sector in a straightforward way . for this",
    ", one simply applies the same techniques used in the case of the bf theory .",
    "surprisingly , the model obtained coincides with the one introduced by de pietri et al . in @xcite",
    "this model was defined as an alternative to the bc model arising naturally in the context of the group field theory ( gft ) framework .",
    "our result provides a clear - cut interpretations of the de pietri et al .",
    "formulation as a quantization of a classical action .",
    "an interesting result is that all the allowed configurations for a 4-simplex in the previous model ( corresponding to generic theory ) are special configurations of this model .",
    "the article is organized in the following way . in the next section we recall essential facts about @xmath0 plebanski formulation . in section [ bf ]",
    "we briefly review the spin foam quantization of the bf theory and introduce our basic definitions . in section [ ccc ]",
    "we solve the constraints that lead one from the bf theory to general relativity and construct the corresponding state - sum model .",
    "we interpret the results and show that configurations have zero 3-volume . in section [ ddeegg ] we quantize the effective action corresponding to the degenerate sectors of plebanski s action and show that the previous model corresponds to a sub - set of the spin foam configurations obtained in the degenerate sector .",
    "we end with concluding remarks in section [ diss ] .",
    "let us start by briefly reviewing plebanski s formulation@xcite at the classical level .",
    "plebanski s riemannian action depends on an @xmath2 connection @xmath3 , a lie - algebra - valued 2-form @xmath1 and lagrange multiplier fields @xmath4 and @xmath5 . writing explicitly the lie - algebra indices ,",

    "are @xmath12 which is equivalent to @xmath13 for @xmath14 where @xmath15@xcite .",
    "the solutions to these equations are @xmath16 in terms of the @xmath17 remaining degrees of freedom of the tetrad field @xmath18 . if one substitutes the first solution into the original action one obtains an effective action that is precisely that of general relativity in the palatini formulation @xmath19=\\int { \\rm tr}\\left[e\\wedge e \\wedge { } ^*f(a)\\right].\\ ] ]",
    "classical ( @xmath20 ) bf theory is defined by the action @xmath21=\\int { \\rm tr}\\left[b\\wedge f(a ) \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is a @xmath20 lie - algebra valued 2-form , @xmath23 is a connection on a @xmath20 principal bundle over @xmath24 .",
    "the theory is rather trivial and all classical solutions are locally equivalent ( up to gauge transformations ) .",
    "the theory has only global degrees of freedom .",
    "one can quantize the theory  la feynman introducing a path integral measure .",
    "this is easily done by replacing the manifold @xmath24 by an arbitrary simplicial decomposition @xmath25 .. see @xcite . ]",
    "take a fixed triangulation @xmath25 of @xmath24 .",

    "associate @xmath27 to each triangle in @xmath25 ( for convenience we use the face sub index @xmath28 since triangles are in one - to - one correspondence to faces @xmath29 ) , and a group element @xmath30 to each edge @xmath31 .",
    "consider the holonomy around faces @xmath32 , i.e. , the product of group elements of the corresponding edges around one face ( an arbitrary orientation of faces has been chosen ) .",

    "next step is to integrate over the connection @xmath45 .",
    "since edges @xmath46 bound four different faces , each group element @xmath45 appears in the mode expansion of four delta functions in ( [ papart ] ) .",

    "vertices @xmath53 are in one - to - one correspondence to 4-simplexes in the triangulation @xmath25 .",
    "in addition we also have @xmath54 representing the assignment of intertwiners to edges .",
    "the sum over the _ coloring _ of edges , @xmath55 , comes from ( [ 4dp ] ) ( for an extensive explanation of the construction of the state - sum for the bf theory and the notation used here see@xcite ) .    what happened in going from equation ( [ zdbf ] ) to ( [ coloring ] ) ?",
    "we have replaced the continuous multiple integral over the @xmath1 s by the sum over representations of @xmath0 .",
    "roughly speaking , the degrees of freedom of @xmath1 are now encoded in the representation being summed over in ( [ coloring ] ) .",
    "one can make a more precise definition of what ` @xmath1 ' is at the level of ( [ coloring ] ) . in order to motivate our definition",
    "we isolate a single face contribution to the integrand in the partition function ( [ zdbf ] ) .",
    "then we notice that the right invariant vector field @xmath56 has a well defined action at the level of equation ( [ coloring ] ) and acts as a ` quantum ' b at the level of ( [ zdbf ] ) since @xmath57}\\right)|_{u\\sim 1 } = x^{ij\\ \\mu } _ { \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\nu}u^{\\nu}_{\\ \\",

    "the evaluation at @xmath59 is motivated by the fact that configurations in the bf partition function ( [ papart ] ) have support on flat connections .    the constraints in ( [ constraints ] )",
    "are quadratic in the @xmath1 s .",

    "therefore , we define the @xmath37 field associated to a face at the level of equation ( [ coloring ] ) as the appropriate right invariant vector field @xmath64 acting on the corresponding discrete holonomy @xmath65 , namely @xmath66 it is easy to verify that one can use left invariant vector fields instead in the previous definition without changing the following results .",
    "now we describe the implementation of the constraints ( [ constraints ] ) .",
    "the idea is to concentrate on a single 4-simplex amplitude using the locality of the bf theory state sum .",
    "the 4-simplex wave function is obtained using ( [ papart ] ) on the dual 2-complex with boundary defined by the intersection of the dual of a single 4-simplex with a 3-sphere , see figure [ chunk ] .",
    "we refer to this fundamental building block as ` atom ' as in @xcite .",
    "the boundary values of the discrete connection are held fixed .",
    "we denote as @xmath67 ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) the corresponding 10 boundary variables ( associated to thin boundary edges in figure [ chunk ] ) are defined as the product @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are associated to half paths as follows : take the edge @xmath74 for simplicity and assume it is oriented from @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "then @xmath77 is the discrete holonomy from @xmath75 to some point in the center of the path and @xmath78 is the holonomy from that center point to @xmath76 .",
    "this splitting of variables is necessary when matching different atoms to reconstruct the simplicial amplitude .",
    "the use of this variables ( wedge variables ) will be crucial in section [ ddeegg ] . for a more detailed description of wedge variables",
    "see @xcite . ] and @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) the internal connection ( corresponding to the thick edges in figure [ chunk ] ) .",
    "according to ( [ papart ] ) the 4-simplex bf amplitude @xmath81 is given by @xmath82 with the definition of the @xmath1 fields given in ( [ b_f ] ) the constrained amplitude , @xmath83 , formally becomes @xmath84\\prod_{i < j } \\delta(g_ih_{ij}g_j),\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the holonomy around the triangular face ( wedge ) @xmath86 according to figure [ chunk ] .",
    "it is easy to verify , using an equation analogous to ( [ riv ] ) , that one can define the @xmath1 s by simply acting with the right invariant vector fields on the boundary connection @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , the previous equation is equivalent to @xmath88 \\int \\prod_i dg_i \\prod_{i < j } \\delta(g_ih_{ij}g_j),\\ ] ] where we have taken the delta function out of the integral .",
    "the quantity on which the formal delta distribution acts is simply @xmath81 ( defined in ( [ pito ] ) ) , which after integrating over the internal connection @xmath89 , and using equation ( [ 4dp ] ) becomes @xmath90{4simm.eps}\\end{array } \\begin{array}{c } \\includegraphics[width=4.5cm]{simincer.eps}\\end{array},\\ ] ] where the circles represent the corresponding @xmath91-representation matrices evaluated on the the corresponding boundary connection @xmath92 .",
    "the term on the left is a @xmath93-symbol as in ( [ bf4 ] ) while the term on the right is the trace of five intertwiners with the respective boundary connection insertions .",
    "notice then that nodes on the two pentagonal diagrams are linked together by the value of their intertwiner .    the 4-simplex amplitude for the constraint spin foam model is then defined as the restriction of @xmath81 imposed by the quantum version of the constraints ( [ constraints ] ) .",
    "the latter are defined by the following set of differential equations @xmath94 and where the index @xmath80 is held fixed .",
    "the translation of the continuum constraint ( [ constraints ] ) into discrete elements associated to faces in @xmath95 is analogous to that given in @xcite .",
    "notice that ( [ xx ] ) is to be thought as a condition on bf amplitudes and is not a general equation to be imposed to any 4-simplex amplitude .",
    "recall that the strategy is to constraint the bf theory to obtain a definition of the path integral for general relativity.we illustrate the general idea with the following simple example .",
    "imagine that the analog of @xmath96 function ( eq .",
    "( [ pito ] ) ) is the integral @xmath97 where @xmath98 $ ] represent the boundary ` connections ' .",
    "the analog of the constraint ( [ constraints ] ) is defined to be @xmath99 which in turn implies the constrained amplitude to be @xmath100 let us now apply the prescription used in the bf theory .",
    "we can expand the un - constrained function ( [ minisf ] ) in terms of ` spin foam ' amplitudes @xmath101 in this case this corresponds to fourier expanding delta function on @xmath102 ( peter - weyl decomposition for @xmath103 ) .",
    "the constraint is now represented by a combination @xmath104 of right invariant vector fields on @xmath105 : @xmath106 .",
    "so we can now impose the constraints by means of selecting those configurations ( modes ) in ( [ minisf ] ) that are annihilated by @xmath104 .",
    "the equation analogous to ( [ xx ] ) is @xmath107 which implies @xmath108 and @xmath109 . ]",
    "equations closely related to ( [ xx ] ) can also be obtained as the geometric restrictions on the @xmath1 s to be simple bi - vectors coming from a dual cotetrad or to characterize the geometry of a tetrahedron in 4 dimensions @xcite . in this case",
    "the equivalent of @xmath1 correspond to bivectors defined by the faces of a classical tetrahedron . using geometric quantization",
    "one obtains the hilbert space of states of the ` quantum tetrahedron ' where the @xmath1 s are promoted to operators .",
    "notice the our @xmath1 operator ( [ riv ] ) is obtained directly from the bf path integral and one does not need to invoke any additional quantization principle . the procedure is completely analogous to the simple example of footnote [ fn ] .",
    "a similar point of view has been taken by reisenberger and freidel - krasnov in @xcite .",
    "the following procedure is very similar in spirit to the bc prescription@xcite .",
    "the essential difference is that we now require the set of restricted configurations to be contained in the set of modes of the bf amplitude , @xmath96 .",
    "there are seven equations ( [ xx ] ) for each value of @xmath110 .",
    "if we consider all the equations for the 4-simplex amplitude then some of them are redundant .",
    "the total number of independent conditions is 20 , in agreement with the number of classical constraints ( [ constraints ] ) . for a given @xmath75 in ( [ xx ] ) (",
    "i.e. , a given tetrahedron ) and for @xmath111 the equation becomes @xmath112 4sim_{const}(h_{ij})=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath113 for @xmath114 $ ] .",
    "the previous constraints are solved by requiring the corresponding representation @xmath115 to be simple , i.e. , @xmath116 .",
    "this solves 10 of the 20 equations .",
    "the next non - trivial condition imposed by ( [ xx ] ) is when @xmath117 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath118 4sim_{const}(h_{ij})\\\\ & & = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used the gauge invariance at the 3-valent node in the tree decomposition that pairs the representation @xmath115 with the @xmath119 . ) as a right - invariant vector field acting on the internal representation @xmath49 . of course",
    "right versus left invariant vector field is a matter of convention which implies a choice of orientation .",
    "since @xmath20 representations are self dual we have @xmath120 . ] , and that we have already solved ( [ xx1 ] ) . in the last line",
    "we assume that the internal color of the corresponding 4-intertwiner is @xmath121 .",
    "this choice of tree decomposition in the case @xmath122 and @xmath123 is illustrated in figure [ nodo ] .",
    "the solution is clearly @xmath124 .",
    "what happens now with any of the other two remaining conditions , for example , @xmath125 for @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 ?",
    "it seems that we ran out o possibilities of restricting the representations .",
    "generically this equations will not be satisfied because an intertwiner that has simple @xmath49 in one tree decomposition has not only simple @xmath129 s components in a different tree decomposition and the equation would be violated .",
    "however there is a case in which this happens trivially , namely when the dimension of the invariant part of the tensor product of the four corresponding representations is unity .",
    "let us write this condition as an equation since this corresponds to the solution of the remaining 5 independent conditions , namely @xmath130\\right)=1\\ ] ] in this case @xmath49 would be simple in any tree decomposition if it is simple in one particular one .",
    "notice that this is the only solution to our constraints as a trivial consequence of the theorem proven by reisenberger in @xcite .",
    "our set of solutions are contained in the barret - crane solutions since our intertwiners agree with the bc one every time that equation ( [ din ] ) is satisfied .",
    "solutions to the previous equation can be characterized as follows .",
    "since all the @xmath91 s are simple we can concentrate on their right ( or left ) components .",
    "assume @xmath131 then the condition is @xmath132 .",
    "explicitly , a few examples of solutions are @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , etc .",
    "the intertwiner color is completely determined by the face colors and a choice of tree decomposition .",
    "if we pair @xmath136 and @xmath137 in our previous example then @xmath138 . the amplitude @xmath139 is independent of the tree decomposition chosen .",
    "once we have solved equations ( [ xx ] ) for a single 4-simplex we can calculate the amplitude of any simplicial decomposition of @xmath140 , @xmath25 .",
    "this is achieved by putting together 4-simplexes with consistent boundary connections and gluing them together by means of integrating over the boundary data in the standard way .",
    "let us point out that there is a potential ambiguity in this step .",
    "we have implemented constraints in the path integral and this generally should be supplemented with the appropriate modification of the measure .",
    "this could affect the values of lower dimensional simplexes such as face and edge amplitudes .",
    "constraints ( [ xx ] ) act on each edge ( tetrahedron ) separately , heuristically one would expect a jacobian factor to modify the edge amplitude of the model since the constraints are non linear functions of the @xmath1 s .",
    "a rigorous derivation of such factors from the path integral definition is lacking in our argument .",
    "we believe that this might shed light on the problem of the correct normalization of this type of spin foam models .",
    "a more detailed study of this issue is being explored in @xcite .",

    "we discuss a rather puzzling feature of the model we have defined above .",
    "if we consider boundaries , then the spin - network states induced as boundaries of spin foams are four - valent and the representations of the corresponding edges satisfy ( [ din ] ) . now using the standard definition of the volume operator on this set of states",
    "we obtain an identically zero result , i.e , the 3-volume operator @xmath145 annihilates the states that solve ( [ xx ] ) .",
    "the reason is that the volume is given by@xcite @xmath146,\\ ] ] where the square is taken using the internal metric @xmath147 .",
    "the solutions to the constraints happen to diagonalize both operators in the commutator which implies @xmath148 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , constraints ( [ constraints ] ) correspond to the non - degenerate phase of solutions of the general constraints ( i.e. , phase with @xmath14 ) . in @xcite",
    "reisenberger explicitly solved the constraints in the degenerate sectors and showed that , in these cases , the action reduces to @xmath149 where the upper index @xmath150 ( respectively @xmath151 ) denotes the self - dual ( respectively anti - self - dual ) part of @xmath1 and @xmath3 in the internal space , and @xmath152 .",
    "let us concentrate in the sector with the minus sign in the previous expression .",

    "it is easier to concentrate on a single 4-simplex amplitude .",
    "furthermore , we start by the wedge shown in figure [ wedge ] . in this figure",
    "we represent one of the 10 wedges that form a 4-simplex atom ( see figure [ chunk ] ) .",
    "both the internal connection @xmath160 ( @xmath161 ) and the boundary connection variables @xmath87 ( @xmath70 ) are in @xmath20 , while @xmath162 is an auxiliary variable .",

    "the wedge amplitude is defined as @xmath164 according to the notation in figure [ wedge ] and where the @xmath165 denotes a @xmath20 delta distribution .",
    "any face in the 2-complex will be defined by as many such wedges as 4-simplexes share the corresponding face .",
    "figure [ facewedge ] illustrates the case for a triangular face .",
    "the vertices @xmath166 and @xmath167 correspond to the centers of the three 4-simplexes sharing the face .",
    "the dotted line denotes the region along which the boundary of the three atoms ( figure [ chunk ] ) join .",
    "it is easy to check that integrating over all but one boundary variables @xmath87 , the contribution of a combination of wedges forming a face @xmath168 is given by @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the discrete holonomy , @xmath171 is a product of the @xmath172 associated to the corresponding wedges and @xmath92 is the remaining boundary connection . in the case shown in figure [ facewedge ] , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 . using that @xmath176 and the definition of the @xmath158 subgroup where @xmath177 lives , the integral over @xmath178 of the previous equation becomes @xmath179 where we have used that @xmath180 and @xmath181 as well as the invariance and normalization of the haar measure .",

    "therefore there is a factor @xmath200 coming from the delta function mode expansion in ( recall footnote ( [ pw ] ) . ) , a factor @xmath201 from the factors in ( [ uuu ] ) , and finally a factor @xmath201 from the boundary connection integrations in the gluing .",
    "this results in a face amplitude equal to unity .",
    "putting all this together one gets a spin foam model were only face representations are constrained to be simple while intertwiners are arbitrary .",
    "explicitly @xmath202{4simm.eps}\\end{array}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this is precisely the spin foam obtained in @xcite !",
    "this model was obtained as a natural modification of the gft that defines a variant of the bc model .",
    "here we have rediscovered the model from the systematic quantization of @xmath203 defined in ( [ rei ] ) .",
    "this establishes the relation of the model with a classical action !",
    "it corresponds to spin foam quantization of the ` @xmath204 ' degenerate sector of @xmath0 plebanski s theory .",
    "the @xmath205 sector action ( [ rei ] ) can be treated in a similar way .",
    "the only modification is that of the subgroup . instead of using the diagonal insertion defined above one has to define @xmath206 so that @xmath207 .",
    "we have restricted to simplicial decompositions but all this should be generalizable along the lines of reference @xcite for arbitrary cellular decompositions of @xmath24 .",
    "this generalization seems straightforward although it should be investigated in detail .    to conclude this section",
    "let us notice that the allowed 4-simplex configurations of the model of section [ ccc ] are fully contained in the set of 4-simplex configurations of the model obtained here .",
    "we come back to this issue in the following section .",
    "the principal idea behind this work was to study the spin foam quantization of plebanski formulation of gravity by restricting the paths that appear in the @xmath0 bf theory .",
    "this strategy is supported by the fact that plebanski s action can be thought of as the @xmath0 bf theory , supplemented by certain constraints on the b field .",
    "gravity in the palatini formulation is obtained as one of the non - degenerate sectors of the solutions to the classical constraints . in the model introduced in section [ ccc ] we defined a prescription for implementing these constraints by restricting the set of histories of the bf theory to those satisfying the ` quantum analog ' of ( [ constraints ] ) .",
    "solution configurations of a single 4-simplex in the model are special 4-simplex bf configurations .",
    "even though the 4-simplex configurations appearing here are a sub - set of the barrett - crane configurations , the great majority of the barrett - crane configurations ( independently of the normalization chosen ) are excluded by the requirement that they be bf configurations .",
    "the nature of the constraints in the bc model is essentially the same as the ones defined here .",
    "the difference is that in the bc case constraints are implemented on a single intertwiner while here we keep track of the fact that intertwiners appear in pairs in the bf state sum ( see ( [ 4dp ] ) ) .",
    "there are alternative ways to motivate the definition of the barrett - crane model which are independent of the line of thought used here .",
    "there is also evidence that relate it to a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "however , we believe that this work shows that there is no obvious way to interpret it as the quantization of plebanski s action . using reasonable definitions",
    "we have shown that one obtains a more restrictive state sum .    in the context of the bc model ,",
    "reference @xcite shows how one can restrict the states of the ` quantum tetrahedron ' so that fake tetrahedra are ruled out of the state sum . in our context",
    "this amounts to resolving the ambiguity between the @xmath208 and @xmath209 solutions of the constraints ( see ( [ ambi ] ) ) at the quantum level . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the ` correct ' configurations are selected by imposing the so - called chirality constraint which is automatically satisfied at the quantum level because it can be written as the commutator of the simplicity constraints ( [ xx ] ) .",
    "it is also shown that the two spaces of solutions ( @xmath208 and @xmath209 respectively ) intersect on the set of configurations for which @xmath148 .",
    "it is easy to see that all this can be translated to our context .",
    "the vanishing of the volume operator implies that in our model one can not distinguish the two type of configurations and that the ambiguity ( [ ambi ] ) remains at the quantum level .",
    "the model of section [ ccc ] contains only degenerate configurations in the sense that spin - network states on the boundaries have zero volume .",
    "this shows that the model can not reproduce any of the semi - classical states of general relativity .",
    "somehow our definition of the constraints at the level of the state - sum are so strong that non - degenerate configurations have been eliminated .",
    "some evidence supporting this view can be obtained considering the following argument .",
    "constraints are implemented locally on each 4-simplex ; therefore , we can concentrate on a single 4-simplex to analyze their action .",
    "if we do so , then we conclude that all the 4-simplex configurations in the model ( [ gr4 ] ) are entirely contained in the set of 4-simplex configurations of the model found in section [ ddeegg ] .",
    "is there a way out ?",
    "if we maintain the point of view of defining the model starting from plebanski s action then the problem can be traced back to our definition of constraints . as it was pointed out in @xcite",
    "there are two ways to write plebanski s constraints in the non - degenerate sector ( i.e. , when @xmath14 in ( [ constraints ] ) ) .",
    "if we stick with ( [ constraints ] ) then one can try to change the definition of the @xmath1 operators .",
    "one possibility would be to change right - invariant by left invariant vector fields in the definition ( [ b_f ] ) .",
    "one can do this consistently only if one changes the orientation of the 4-simplex in which case the final result remains the same .",
    "one can try to use the sum of right - invariant and left invariant vector fields .",
    "this is certainly",
    "a possibility , and actually converges faster to the value of @xmath1 in the sense of equation ( [ riv ] ) when @xmath210 .",
    "however , since the constraints are quadratic in the @xmath1 there will be cross - terms in ( [ xx ] ) .",
    "this terms can not be expressed in terms of @xmath20 casimir operators , and consequently , the constraints can not be solved in terms of simple restrictions on the set of representations involved in the state - sum . there seem to be no obvious way to use ( [ constraints ] ) and avoid the discouraging results of section [ ccc ] .",
    "the other possibility is to use @xmath211 where the difference with ( [ constraints ] ) is in the fact that we have traded internal with space - time indices .",
    "however with this choice , the connection with the bc model becomes much more uncertain .",
    "notice that in this form , the constraints have free lie - algebra indices and therefore can not be written as casimir operators as they stand .",
    "this version of the constraints has been studied in the literature .",
    "such constraints have been incorporated in a spin foam model of riemannian general relativity in terms of self - dual variables by reisenberger in @xcite . in the context of @xmath0 plebanski",
    "s action a model along this lines has been defined by freidel et al . in @xcite . but all these models are quite different from the bc model .",
    "we believe that this shows that there is no obvious means of interpreting the bc model as a spin foam quantization of plebanski s theory .",
    "let us conclude by analyzing the results of the last section .",
    "in section [ ddeegg ] we quantized the degenerate sectors of plebanski s action in a fairly straightforward way .",
    "in this case we do not impose any constraints and the state sum follows directly from the discretized definition of the path integral of the theory .",
    "there are no ambiguities in lower dimensional simplex - amplitudes .",
    "the model turns out to be precisely the one introduced by de pietri , freidel , krasnov and rovelli in @xcite .",
    "this work establishes a clear connection between that model and the effective action corresponding to one of the degenerate sectors of plebanski s action .",
    "finally the model is well defined , is not topological and has a clear connection to a continuous action .",
    "it is somehow between the theory we want to define and the simpler theories we understand well but do not have local excitations ( such as bf theory and gravity in lower dimensions ) . from this viewpoint",
    "we believe that it might be useful to explore its properties as a ` toy model ' for understanding open issues in the spin foam approach to quantum gravity . among these",
    "is the very important problem of the continuum limit ( i.e. , the issue of summing - over versus refining discretizations ) and the interpretation of the path integral in the diffeomorphism invariant context ( time evolution versus the projector / extractor operator on physical states ) .",
