    "through a strong coupling expansion of a wilson loop in a space - time ( euclidean ) lattice , wilson @xcite showed evidence for confinement in a pure _ compact _ @xmath3 gauge theory , marking the beginning of a new method for nonperturbative investigation of quantum field theories .",
    "ironically , a similar calculation is equally applicable to pure @xmath0 gauge theory that shows nontrivial properties at strong gauge coupling ( the compact formulation allows self - interaction for all powers of the abelian gauge fields on the discrete lattice ) .",
    "the hallmark of wilson s approach is that gauge invariance is manifest at all stages of the calculation and gauge - fixing is not required .",
    "the theory is rigorously defined through a functional integral with a gauge - invariant ( haar ) measure with group - valued gauge fields .",
    "the algebra - valued gauge fields become noncompact , smooth and dimensionful only in the continuum limit .    because of known physics from weak - coupling quantum electrodynamics , a @xmath0 gauge theory , it was expected that at an intermediate gauge coupling , there would be a phase transition from the strong coupling to a familiar weak coupling phase with free massless photons in the continuum limit for the pure gauge theory . indeed monte carlo simulations found this transition , which was later confirmed to be first order @xcite .",
    "absence of a diverging correlation length meant that no quantum continuum limit could be taken in this @xmath0 theory .",
    "we shall now take a short detour to lattice formulations of chiral gauge theories to understand why in certain situations there is a need to control the longitudinal modes of lattice gauge fields .",
    "fermions on the discrete lattice necessarily break chiral symmetry @xcite . for chiral gauge theories ,",
    "obviously the gauge symmetry is then explicitly broken on the lattice .",
    "lack of gauge invariance in the wilson framework ( without gauge - fixing ) necessarily means strong coupling between the physical degrees of freedom and the longitudinal gauge degrees of freedom ( _ lgdof_s ) .",
    "this is explained in the following .",
    "because of the haar measure , the functional integral is over all gauge configurations , including the ones related to each other by gauge transformations . as a result , after a gauge transformation , the _ lgdof_s become explicitly present in the action and interact with the physical degrees of freedom .",
    "this interaction is strong because there is no gauge - fixing and any point on the gauge orbit is as likely as any other , essentially making the gauge fields very rough .",
    "the rough gauge problem was the main reason of failure of a full class of lattice chiral gauge theories @xcite .",
    "these failures gave rise to the understanding that controlling the dynamics of _ lgdof_s in these theories ( in other words , gauge - fixing ) is essential to avoid undesirable results .",
    "however , the becchi - rouet - stora - tyutin ( brst ) scheme , a standard mechanism for taking care of the redundancy related to the _ lgdof_s , can not be used in this general nonperturbative case with compact gauge fields , because of a theorem , due to neuberger , that proves that the partition function and the unnormalized expectation value of a gauge - invariant operator are each zero in presence of a brst symmetry @xcite . this is presumably due to the cancelling contributions from a bunch of gribov copies signalling multiple solutions of the gauge - fixing condition .    for the general non - abelian case",
    ", the above theorem can be evaded by employing an equivariant brst ( ebrst ) formalism @xcite where gauge - fixing is done only in the coset space , leaving , for example , an abelian subgroup gauge - invariant .",
    "this may be taken as a viable alternate nonperturbative scheme for defining a non - abelian gauge theory , a proposal worthy of investigation by itself .",
    "however , for a chiral gauge theory , the residual abelian gauge symmetry needs to be fixed in an appropriate manner . failing to do so leads to a strongly interacting sector of _",
    "lgdof_s which is undesirable , as explained above .",
    "in fact , because of the no - go theorem mentioned above , any brst - type symmetry can not be entertained for the abelian theory either . a naive lattice transcription of a covariant gauge fixing term results disastrously in a dense set of lattice gribov copies @xcite . to overcome this issue , shamir and",
    "golterman @xcite proposed to add , to the standard wilson lattice gauge action for the compact @xmath0 pure gauge case , a higher - derivative ( hd ) term ( involving physical fields only ) , breaking gauge invariance explicitly .",
    "this term , as a first requirement , leads to a covariant gauge fixing term in the naive continuum limit , and , at the same time , is designed to ensure , in the weak gauge coupling limit , a unique absolute minimum for the effective potential , thus avoiding the problem of the gribov copies and enabling weak - coupling perturbation theory ( wcpt ) around the unique vacuum .",
    "counterterms are possible to construct because of the emergence of a renormalizable gauge , and are required to restore gauge symmetry .",
    "wcpt analysis and numerical investigations performed earlier @xcite , only in the weak gauge coupling region of the above compact abelian pure gauge theory , confirmed the existence of a new continuous phase transition between a regular ordered phase and a spatially modulated ordered phase , for sufficiently large value of the coefficient of the hd term . at this phase transition ,",
    "gauge symmetry is restored and the scalar fields ( _ lgdof_s ) decouple , leading to the desired emergence of massless free photons only , in the continuum limit taken from the regular broken phase .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the phase diagram of the above compact @xmath0 pure gauge theory with the hd gauge - fixing term and a suitable counterterm , _ in the strong gauge coupling region _ and present only the key findings regarding the nature of the possible continuum limits in that region .",
    "details of our investigation will be available in @xcite .",
    "our work is important from several points of view .",
    "first , for both abelian and non - abelian chiral gauge theories in the nonperturbative gauge - fixing approach , it is important to know , for a large range of the gauge couplings ( including strong gauge couplings ) , that a correct continuum limit ( with the _ lgdof_s decoupled and massless free photons ) is achievable in the pure abelian gauge theory . theory .",
    "] second , given that the pure compact @xmath0 gauge theory with the hd term , in the weak gauge coupling region , has produced a correct quantum continuum limit with free massless photons , it is important to explore a broader region of the coupling parameter space and ask what happens for strong gauge couplings .",
    "obviously this question is linked with the issue of short distance behavior of @xmath0 gauge theory and possibility of nontrivial physics .",
    "third , hd actions are a challenge for algorithms , especially the so - called local update algorithms .",
    "the theory provides a good opportunity to evaluate aspects of different algorithms with large coefficients of the hd term .",
    "lastly , because of the presence of tricritical points and critical endpoints in the phase diagram as we shall see , and phase transitions that restore a local symmetry , the investigated theory is interesting also from the point of view of statistical mechanics and critical phenomena",
    ".    the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[action ] , the lattice action under investigation for the compact @xmath0 gauge theory is presented .",
    "the action contains a hd gauge fixing term which includes irrelevant pieces , and also a counter - term required for reviving the gauge symmetry .",
    "section [ action ] also summarises the main results from previous investigations of the theory at weak gauge couplings .",
    "section [ num ] presents some of the details of our numerical investigations in the parameter space of the action , including the algorithms used in our investigation .",
    "the results of our investigation are presented in sec.[results ] which identifies the tricritical point and determines the possible continuum limits . finally , in sec.[conclu ] , we present our conclusions on the possible continuum physics from the theory investigated at strong gauge couplings .",
    "the investigated lattice action is given by : @xmath4 where , @xmath5 is the ( gauge - invariant ) wilson term containing a summation over all gauge plaquettes @xmath6 , the plaquette being the smallest wilson loop on a @xmath7 plane .",
    "the second term in ( [ s ] ) is the golterman - shamir hd gauge - fixing term , given by @xmath8 with the covariant laplacian @xmath9 and , @xmath10    the third term @xmath11 represents possible counterterms , and we use @xmath12 which is a dimension-2 mass counterterm , as apparent from expanding the lattice gauge field @xmath13 for small lattice spacing @xmath14 .",
    "also possible are a host of marginal counterterms that can be treated perturbatively @xcite .",
    "the dimension-2 counterterm is enough to give rise to a new universality class , as we shall see .",
    "the presence of the hd term ensures a unique absolute minimum for the action at @xmath15 , validating wcpt around @xmath16 or @xmath17 and leads to the familiar covariant gauge fixing term @xmath18 in the naive continuum limit with @xmath19 .",
    "plane at a given weak gauge coupling ( @xmath20 ) .",
    ", height=170 ]     plane at gauge coupling @xmath21 on @xmath22 lattice . ]",
    "the action contains only physical fields ( and does not include , for example , ghosts which are expected to decouple only in the continuum limit ) and as such is not brst - invariant .",
    "the relevant symmetry for the action ( [ s ] ) is the gauge symmetry , and @xmath23 $ ] and @xmath24 $ ] are not gauge - invariant . under a gauge transformation @xmath25 ,",
    "these terms pick up the _ lgdof_s , and the theory becomes a scalar - gauge system with @xmath26 $ ] where mass of the scalar fields @xmath27 with @xmath28 may scale in an appropriate continuous phase transition of the lattice theory .",
    "however , the goal here is not to have a gauge - higgs theory in the continuum , it is rather to decouple the scalar fields ( _ lgdof_s ) at a continuum limit .",
    "the two extra terms ( with coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) ensure that in the neighborhood of the perturbative point ( i.e. , for small @xmath31 and large @xmath30 ) the _ lgdof_s are weakly coupled , and indeed numerical simulations confirm that the _ lgdof_s decouple at a new phase transition separating the regular ordered phase ( to be called fm in the following ) from a so - called spatially modulated ordered phase ( fmd ) @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations in @xcite , were done at weak couplings ( @xmath20 ) in the so - called vector picture ( action ( [ s ] ) where no scalars appear explicitly ) and in the so - called higgs picture ( action with both scalars and gauge fields , obtained after a gauge transformation ) . for weak couplings ,",
    "these studies confirmed a phase diagram with generic features as given in fig.[weakphasedia ] .",
    "the nomenclature of the phases in this theory has been taken as per the phases in the so - called reduced model @xcite .",
    "the reduced model is obtained by putting @xmath15 ( corresponding to the trivial orbit ) in the higgs picture of the theory .",
    "the regular broken phase , fm ( with ferromagnetic order ) is characterized by a massive photon and a massive scalar , the pm ( for paramagnetic ) phase is the disordered ( symmetric ) phase having massless photons , and finally the new fmd ( ferromagnetic - directional ) phase is the spatially modulated ordered phase that breaks euclidean rotational symmetry with a nonzero vector condensate ( @xmath32 ) ( there is also an antiferromagnetic or am phase with staggered order , not to be discussed further in this study ) .",
    "photon and scalar masses scale by approaching the continuous fm - pm transition from the fm phase , leading to a continuum gauge - higgs theory .",
    "a sufficiently large @xmath30 ( and small @xmath31 ) ensures a satisfactory continuum limit with only the photon mass scaling ( thereby recovering gauge symmetry and decoupling the scalars ) at the fm - fmd phase transition by tuning a single parameter @xmath29 from the fm side .",
    "given the above that this new formulation of a compact @xmath0 gauge theory on lattice produces a correct continuum limit for weak gauge couplings , it is certainly worthwhile to ask about the nature of a continuum limit , if at all , for strong gauge couplings and also explore the possibilities of a nontrivial theory .",
    "the strong coupling region was first explored in @xcite with speculations of a few novel features . in this paper ,",
    "a completely independent and new investigation , a more careful and precise exercise has been carried out employing new methods ( see sec.[num ] below ) . as a result ,",
    "a clear picture of the phase diagram of the theory at strong gauge couplings has emerged . in the following , we present",
    "some of the key findings , principal among them is the existence of fm - fmd transition even at strong gauge couplings , and tricritical points on this transition .     versus @xmath29 plot on three different lattice volumes at @xmath21 and @xmath33 , showing a first order fm - fmd transition .",

    "inset shows @xmath36 versus @xmath29 plots for the same parameters . ]",
    "multihit metropolis , a local update algorithm that was used in all previous investigations of the theory ( e.g. @xcite ) , was discarded for the current work because at large @xmath31 it produced results unstable against variation of the number of hits and also the particular order the lattice was swept .",
    "this is understandable , since with such a hd action density , spread over quite a few lattice sites , a local algorithm is bound to struggle , especially at large @xmath30 ( at strong gauge couplings , the fm - fmd transition is obtained at larger @xmath30 ) . in this paper",
    ", we present results of numerical simulation done with hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) , a global algorithm , and this marks a major difference with our previous work @xcite and produces new , reliable and numerically stable results at strong gauge couplings so that we now have a better understanding of the possible continuum limit at the fm - fmd transition at strong gauge couplings .",
    "numerical simulation was done at gauge couplings @xmath37 and also at 0.6 and 0.8 ( for comparing with available results in literature ) at a variety of lattice volumes @xmath38 and @xmath39 to determine the phase diagrams in the @xmath40 plane at each fixed gauge coupling with @xmath29-scans and @xmath30-scans having intervals as fine as @xmath41 around the interesting phase transition regions .",
    "each run in the scans typically has 5000 hmc trajectories for thermalization , and 10000 - 30000 hmc trajectories for measurement .",
    "integrated autocorrelation times were measured and taken into account for error estimates .",
    "error bars of all data points , wherever not shown explicitly , are smaller than the symbols .",
    "only a small fraction of our results are produced here , more details will be made available in @xcite .",
    "measurements were made on lattice volume of @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 , @xmath44 for propagators ) for the plaquette energy @xmath45 the photon mass term @xmath46 the lattice version @xmath36 of the vector condensate @xmath47 ( expectation value of the modulus of @xmath48 averaged over all the directions ) , the photon propagator and also the chiral condensate with quenched kogut - susskind ( ks ) fermions .",
    "the vector condensate @xmath36 is the order parameter for the fm - fmd transition .",
    "in fig.[strongphasedia ] we show the phase diagram at a fixed strong coupling @xmath21 in the @xmath40 plane ( with a certain criterion to determine the transitions on a finite lattice ) .",
    "similar phase diagrams were also obtained for @xmath49 .",
    "contrast the above with that of fig.[weakphasedia ] .",
    "the fm - fmd phase transition in fig.[weakphasedia ] for @xmath20 is entirely a continuous transition @xcite , while for strong @xmath31 ( fig.[strongphasedia ] ) there is a tricritical point separating a first order fm - fmd transition from a continuous transition .",
    "figure [ strongphasedia ] shows the tricritical point for @xmath21 at @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the lattice size @xmath22 .",
    "the location changes slightly with lattice volumes bigger than @xmath52 .",
    "the pm - fmd transition is found to be strongly first order , and ends at a critical endpoint @xcite where the continuous fm - pm transition terminates at first order transitions .",
    "the first order fm - fmd transition weakens gradually as @xmath30 is increased till the tricritical point where it becomes continuous .",
    "the location of the triciritical point in the @xmath40 plane shifts to more negative @xmath29 and also to larger @xmath30 with increasing @xmath31 .",
    "it appears from our simulation that , at a particular gauge coupling @xmath53 between @xmath54 and 1.1 , the tricritical point tends to approach the critical endpoint . for @xmath55 ,",
    "the fm - fmd transition is fully continuous .",
    "the rest of the plots in this paper are all at @xmath21 .",

    "the inset of fig.[firstorder ] shows a double peaked histogram at the critical @xmath29 , confirming the transition to be first order .",

    "extrapolation to zero bare fermion mass @xmath62 was done with a phenomenological polynomial ansatz ( keeping up to quadratic terms with five lowest masses fitted ) and shows a condensate consistent with zero on the continuous side of the fm - fmd transition while clearly there is a nonzero condensate where the transition is first order .",
    "there is a hint of nonzero chiral condensate as the tricritical point is approached from the fm side .",
    "however , confirmation on larger volumes is required .",
    "the inverse of photon propagator ( 2-point correlator of @xmath63 ) in momentum space was also measured and is plotted against the square of lattice momentum @xmath64 ( discrete on a finite box ) in fig.[photonprop ] for the continuous part of the fm - fmd transition , staying in the fm phase . at three @xmath30 are each at a value of @xmath29 which is at a fixed small distance away ( @xmath65 ) from the fm - fmd transition .",
    "] inset shows a gradually vanishing photon mass ( @xmath66-intercept ) , as @xmath29 approaches @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) for the given fixed @xmath30 ( 0.6 ) , suggesting an expected scaling of the photon mass at the transition and recovery of gauge symmetry .",
    "the slope of the fitted straight lines , in the main figure , suggests a field renormalization constant @xmath69 that is not unity .",
    "however , the figure shows that the slope increases with increasing @xmath30 .",
    "it seems reasonable to expect the slope to approach unity at large @xmath30 , consistent with wcpt at @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , the continuous fm - fmd transition line at all strong @xmath31 is found in our simulations to be below but roughly parallel to the transition ( the dotted line in fig.[strongphasedia ] ) , obtained from 1-loop wcpt in @xcite .",
    "of course , the gap between them decreases as the coupling gets smaller .",
    "the phase diagram of the compact @xmath0 pure gauge theory in the nonperturbative gauge - fixing approach including the hd term and a mass counterterm has turned out to be somewhat more complex in the strong gauge coupling region ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "numerical simulation is also more difficult in this region , and local update algorithms struggle , forcing us to use global update algorithms with some care .",
    "however , after the algorithmic issues were sorted out , a clear picture of the possible continuum limits has emerged which is very relevant for all the major important issues discussed in sec.[intro ] , e.g. , both abelian and non - abelian lattice chiral gauge theories and short distance behavior of @xmath0 gauge theories .",
    "existence of the fm - fmd transition at strong gauge couplings is confirmed .",
    "the continuous part of this transition , away from the tricritical point , appears to produce familiar physics with free massless photons ( and _ lgdof_s decoupled ) and zero chiral condensate .",
