    "a large number of theoretical models have been constructed over the years since it was first observed that inclusively produced hyperons are polarized .",
    "these models have met with varying degrees of success , but it is clear that more data and theoretical work are needed to clarify the picture .",
    "a review of the current status is found in  @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 polarization is well studied with a proton beam , both in inclusive  @xcite and exclusive  @xcite reactions . for @xmath3 beam ,",
    "only the wa89 experiment at cern reports polarization measurements for @xmath0 and @xmath1 as function of @xmath7 for one average value of @xmath6  @xcite , and for @xmath0 as function of both @xmath7 and @xmath6  @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the polarization is negative for small @xmath6 , incrementing to positive values with @xmath6 , but with a non - monotonic behavior as a function of @xmath7 for different values of @xmath6 .    in this study",
    "we exploit the capabilities of the selex apparatus to measure the polarization of @xmath0 and @xmath1 inclusively produced by @xmath3 and proton beams .",
    "the goal is to measure the polarizations as functions of @xmath6 and @xmath7 with higher beam momenta as the earlier wa89 measurement , using a different analysis method presenting different systematics , and extending the @xmath1 polarization measurements to several values in @xmath6 ; in addition , we add as a cross check the measurements with proton beam within the same experiment .",
    "the selex ( e781 ) experiment at fermilab is a fixed target experiment designed primarily for high statistics studies of charmed baryons produced by a charged hyperon beam incident on a segmented copper / carbon target .",
    "however , the versatility of the apparatus allowed for the study of other reactions  @xcite in the same target . in this work",
    "we study the polarization of inclusively produced @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "more specifically we determine the polarization and its @xmath6 and @xmath7 dependence .",
    "we follow the basel convention  @xcite for the sign of the polarization .",
    "the charged hyperon beam , which we use as a primary beam for @xmath5 production , was obtained in the fermilab proton center beamline by steering @xmath11 protons from the tevatron onto a @xmath12 beryllium target located at the entrance of a @xmath13 , @xmath14 hyperon magnet  @xcite .",
    "a curved channel in this magnet selected a beam of negative ( positive ) particles with a mean momentum of @xmath2 ( @xmath15 ) and a spread of @xmath16 hwhm .",
    "the negative beam consisted of approximately equal parts @xmath3 and @xmath17 with a small admixture of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , while the positive beam contained about @xmath20 protons , in a total of @xmath21 beam particles per second .",
    "the targeting angle was set to zero degrees , thereby insuring an unpolarized incident beam .    the portion of the experimental setup relevant to this analysis , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ figapp ] , consisted of a beam spectrometer ,    a vertexing region and two downstream spectrometers ( m1 and m2 ) .",
    "the beam spectrometer included the hyperon magnet , beam transition radiation detectors ( btrd ) and beam silicon strip detectors ( bssd ) .",
    "the vertex region consisted of five segmented targets ( 2  cu , 3  c each separated by @xmath22 - altogether @xmath23 of an interaction length ) and 20  planes of vertex silicon strip detectors ( vssd ) , which resolved the interaction vertex and secondary vertices .",
    "for vssd tracks , the transverse position resolution was @xmath24 at @xmath25 .",
    "the m1 spectrometer was a wide angle spectrometer , designed to analyze particles with momenta between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this spectrometer contained the m1  magnet ( @xmath28 ) , large angle silicon strip detectors ( lasd ) , and proportional multi - wire chambers ( pwc ) . the second spectrometer ( m2 ) , downstream of m1 , analyzed particles with momenta @xmath29 .",
    "its components were the m2 magnet ( @xmath30 ) , lasd , pwc , and a ring - imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detector  @xcite used for particle identification , which provided @xmath31 separation up to @xmath32 .",
    "a hardware trigger and software filter were used in selex to select the secondary interactions .",
    "the hardware trigger consisted of the beam , veto and hodoscope scintillation counters .",
    "the first level synchronized the trigger to beam particles .",
    "the second level selected events where the btrd determined the beam particle was most likely a heavy particles ( @xmath3 or proton ) , with an additional refined definition in the analysis stage .",
    "the beam interacted in one of the five targets , and more than 3  charged tracks were observed downstream of the target region of which at least 2 were positive tracks with momentum greater than @xmath27 .",
    "triggered events accounted for @xmath33 of interactions .",
    "a software filter looked for evidence of a secondary vertex and a reconstructed primary vertex using high momentum ( @xmath29 ) tracks .",
    "the software filter further reduced the data set by a factor of 8 .",
    "a sample of unfiltered data was always recorded for filter performance and systematic error analysis .",
    "the @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) candidates were selected by requiring oppositely charge track pairs to form a vertex at least @xmath36 downstream of the primary vertex , where @xmath37 is the combined error of the @xmath38-coordinates of the primary and secondary vertex , and upstream of the first vssd plane .",
    "the positive ( negative ) track was required to be identified by the rich as a proton candidate . in fig .",
    "[ signals ] we show the invariant mass distributions of these @xmath39 and @xmath40 candidates , and in table  [ tab : yields ] we summarize the available statistics .",

    "for the inclusive production of @xmath0 by a @xmath3 beam , our results confirm the wa89  @xcite measurements ( obtained via the bias canceling method ) of a generally positive polarization , increasing with @xmath6 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lamsigxf ] and [ fig : lamsigpt ] . at small @xmath7 and",
    "@xmath42 the polarization is almost @xmath10 , and in general the dependence on @xmath7 is non - monotonic for different bins of @xmath6 , increasing and decreasing after reaching some maximum value . comparing to the earlier , lower - statistics wa89",
    "@xcite result with the dependence on @xmath7 for @xmath43 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : others ] , upper left and table  [ tab : otherspt ] ) , we observe small polarization values confirming the previous measurement .",
    "the authors of  @xcite attribute the non - monotonic behavior of the polarization as function of @xmath7 and @xmath6 to different production mechanism in different kinematic regimes .",
    "we also examined the target dependence , but no difference was found .    for the polarization for @xmath0 produced by a proton beam as a function of @xmath7 ,",

    "[ fig : others ] ( lower right ) and table  [ tab : othersxf ] ) .    in conclusion , we measured the polarization of inclusively produced @xmath0 with a @xmath3 beam , and confirming the wa89 results with a different analysis method and higher beam momentum .",
