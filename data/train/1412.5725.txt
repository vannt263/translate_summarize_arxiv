    "over the past few decades there has been much activity on the non - reciprocity effect in optics@xcite .",
    "non - reciprocal optical elements , such as optical isolators , have attracted great attention owing to its capability of allowing light to propagate only along a single direction , while strongly suppressing backward scattering .",
    "the traditional way for creating nonreciprocal devices relies on magneto - optic faraday effect in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "however , the intrinsic weakness of faraday effects based on available magneto - optical ( mo ) materials makes the faraday rotator bulky and hinders miniaturization of such devices .",
    "later , the photonic crystal ( pc ) made of mo materials @xcite was suggested to enhance the nonreciprocal response , and create compact and integrated isolators and circulators .",
    "recently , raghu and haldane @xcite theoretically predicted one - way edge modes could be observed in mo photonic crystals , as optical counterparts to chiral edge states of electrons in the quantum hall effect .",
    "these modes are confined to the region near the edge of the 2d pc , displaying one - way propagation characteristics .",
    "subsequently , experimental realizations and observations of such electromagnetic one - way edge states in different magneto - optical photonic crystal ( mpcs ) were reported by several groups @xcite .",
    "nonreciprocal behavior has also been demonstrated by considering dynamic modulation in standard materials @xcite , the use of opto - mechanical @xcite and opto - acoustic effects @xcite and optical nonlinearities @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "considerable efforts have been intensively devoted to a new class of artificial optical materials having balanced loss and gain - _ parity - time _",
    "( @xmath0)-symmetric metamaterials @xcite .",
    "such @xmath0-symmetric systems have non - hermitian hamiltonians , exhibiting with entirely real eigenvalues as long as @xmath0 symmetry holds .",
    "remarkably , the system may undergo an abrupt phase transition ( spontaneous @xmath0 symmetry - breaking ) at some non - hermiticity threshold , beyond which some of the eigenvalues become complex . to date",
    ", several @xmath0-symmetric models have been demonstrated with some intriguing light propagation behaviors , including power oscillations @xcite , double refraction @xcite , unidirectional invisibility @xcite , non - reciprocal light transmission @xcite and unattenuated surface modes @xcite .",
    "it turns out that @xmath0-symmetry has a strong linkage to perfect transmission states @xcite .",
    "this type of spatial - temporal symmetry can be more general than the usual symmetry - related perfect transmission associated with mirror symmetry or inversion symmetry .",
    "since such a @xmath0-symmetry - related perfect transmission is complementary to non - reciprocity , it is also useful for the design of optical isolator displaying one - way perfect transmission with no gain medium such as the case in this paper . in the present work ,",
    "we consider a structure composed of two mds with @xmath0 symmetry @xcite , magnetized homogenously in opposite directions , and find a new type of non - reciprocal mu - near - zero ( mnz ) modes at the interface separating two mds near the frequency of zero effective permeability .",
    "the broken @xmath1 and @xmath2 symmetries , induced here simultaneously by the geometry and the orientation of the external magnetic field , result in the asymmetrical dispersion relations of the interface mode , whereas the unbroken @xmath0 symmetry leads to the emergence of the perfect transmission mode @xcite .",
    "furthermore , two pronounced nonreciprocal behaviors are exhibited by application of such a mnz mode for incident plane waves : one - way complete optical tunneling at oblique incidence and unidirectional beam shift at normal incidence .",
    "calculations on nonreciprocal dispersion relations , reflection spectra and field patterns for such a @xmath0-symmetric system are employed to verify our conclusions .",

    "ii , the exact analytical modal description is employed to investigate the non - reciprocal mnz mode in the @xmath0-symmetric system we proposed . sec .",
    "iii shows the numerical results of reflection spectra and field patterns for the finite - size @xmath0-symmetric system . finally , the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "we start with two semi - infinite mds constructed by mo media oppositely magnetized in the voigt geometry as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) . under the external static magnetic field",
    "along @xmath3 , the two semi - infinite mds are , characterized respectively by identical permittivities @xmath4 and magnetic permeability tensors @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 we take the following parameters for mds @xcite , i.e. , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the precession frequency , @xmath11 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath12 is the applied magnetic field on the two mds , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the saturation magnetization .",
    "the parameters are chosen to fulfill @xmath0 symmetry @xmath15 , which will lead to perfect transmission modes .",
    "the complex conjugate in @xmath16 is associated with time - reversal operation ( see appendix a ) .",
    "it should be noted that only transverse electric ( te ) polarization ( i.e. , electric field along the @xmath17 direction ) is considered , and the @xmath18 time - dependent convention for harmonic field is used in this work .",
    "-symmetric system .",
    "( a ) two semi - infinite mds locate at @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "( b ) finite - size bilayer md slabs composed of two halves of identical thickness @xmath21 , embedded in surrounding mediums ( with refractive index @xmath22 ) . labels @xmath23 are used to indicate four different regions in our system .",
    "( c ) the dispersion relation of interface modes in ( a ) .",
    "yellow and white regions represent bands and gaps of an infinite md , respectively .",
    "( d ) the radiative modes in ( b ) .",
    "the bulk band - edge for magnetic materials ( gray lines ) , light curves for surround mediums ( dashed lines ) , and the frequency line ( dotted lines ) corresponding to zero effective permeability of md are also shown . in ( c)(d ) , we set @xmath24 ( here @xmath25 denotes the speed of light in vacuum ) as a scale to represent the transversal wave vector @xmath26 . for the mode solutions in ( d ) for the finite - size bilayer mds structure ,",
    "each magnetic layer is assumed to have equal thickness @xmath27 m , and the surrounding medium with refractive index @xmath28.,width=307 ]    before we solve for the solutions of the interface modes , it should be noted that each md also supports bulk modes given by the dispersion relation , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the effective permeability defined as @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the wavevector in the @xmath33-plane . due to the resonance feature of @xmath34 ,",
    "a typical resonance gap is opened and the bulk modes are divided into two groups of bands for @xmath35 as shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) , with the upper bands bounded by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and the lower bands bounded by @xmath38 and @xmath37 .    to form guided waves at the interface between two mds , the field should decay exponentially away from the interface , and can be written as follows : @xmath39 and @xmath40 . here ,",

    "@xmath51 \" solution for an interface mode , shown with black solid lines in fig .",
    "1(c ) as well as in ref.@xcite . more interestingly ,",
    "if we take into account the possibility of @xmath52 ( here @xmath53 ) at @xmath54 in this specified case , there exists an extra solution of interface mode in this @xmath0-symmetric system : @xmath55 we called such a non - trivial solution the @xmath52 mode .",
    "it is interesting that the mode is purely magnetic with no electric field while the two orthogonal components of magnetic field has the following unique relations : @xmath56 indicating the certain phase difference between @xmath57 and @xmath58 with @xmath59 in the left domains region and @xmath60 at the right .",
    "moreover , in order to guarantee the positive decay rate ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) , the parallel component of wave vector @xmath26 should remain negative , which leads to the emergence of a nonreciprocal @xmath52 mode shown by the red line in fig .",
    "here , we use parameters for mds provided in a previous experimental study @xcite , i.e. @xmath63 oe , and @xmath64 g.    however , the nonreciprocal @xmath52 modes between two semi - infinite domains form a flat band and thus they are non - propagating , which makes the modes difficult to be excited . to improve its optical response , we alter the infinite systems by the finite - size bilayer mds still with @xmath0 symmetry [ shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , and here assumed with identical thickness @xmath65 , embedded in an uniform surrounding medium . based on the transfer matrix approach @xcite",
    ", the radiative modes for such a bilayer system outside the light line for surrounding mediums could be well solved .",
    "two kinds of mode solutions could be analytically separated as @xmath66 for reciprocal ( symmetrical ) modes and @xmath67    \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 0 \\label{asymm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for non - reciprocal ( asymmetrical ) ones ( appendix b gives the derivation of eq .",

    "@xmath68 and @xmath69 are the permittivity and permeability for surrounding medium , and the wave - vector components normal to the interface in background and magnetic materials are taken as @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the reciprocal propagating modes in eq.([symm ] ) for such bilayer md systems are identical to those in a single slab layer of md , simultaneously independent of surrounding mediums .",
    "it should be emphasized that the linear term of @xmath26 in eq.([asymm ] ) breaks the spectral reciprocity ( i.e. , the left - right symmetry of the dispersion relation ) , leading to strong non - reciprocal behaviors .",
    "furthermore , in the limit of @xmath72 , there is always a solution at @xmath73 identical with eq.([disp ] ) for the infinite system in fig .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "1(d ) the corresponding radiative electromagnetic modes within the light cone for surrounding media with the refractive index @xmath28 .",
    "each magnetic layer has equal thickness @xmath27 m. the reciprocal and non - reciprocal modes are shown by blue and red lines , respectively .",
    "it is found that the original flat and non - propagating @xmath52 mode interacts with the propagating modes in bilayer mds , and extends to the bulk band for magnetic materials , thereby becoming dispersive .",
    "so we achieve a non - reciprocal mu - near - zero ( @xmath74 ) radiative mode for thin films of md structures , and expect to see the non - reciprocal optical response for the dispersive mode near the frequency @xmath73 corresponding to @xmath52 , with direct illumination of external plane waves .",

    "gray and dashed lines in ( a ) , and the mds structure parameters used here are the same as those in fig .",
    "to support our findings , we investigate the wave propagation behaviors through finite - size @xmath0-symmetric mds , with numerical calculations on the reflection spectra [ shown in fig .",

    "apparently , it is seen that reflectance dips shown as dark blue colors in fig .",
    "2(a ) are in excellent agreement with those radiative modes in fig .",
    "1(d ) , and the dispersive and non - reciprocal @xmath74 mode could be well excited under external plane waves , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) with a particular example of the frequency @xmath80 close to @xmath73 .",
    "in contrast to the usual @xmath51 interface mode indicated with a very narrow dip in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the coupled @xmath74 mode shows strong non - reciprocity response over a much wider region of the incident angle .",
    "it should be noted that in a one - dimensional @xmath0-symmetric system with balanced gain and loss , there exists a new conservation rule @xmath81 @xcite , where @xmath82 is the transmittance through the entire system , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are , respectively , the reflectances for left and the right rays traveling either upwards or downwards . such a system is reciprocal in the linear regime .",
    "in contrast , the non - reciprocal  hermitian \" system discussed in this paper obeys the standard conservation laws @xmath85 and @xmath86 instead for upward and downward rays , even the transmittances in opposite directions ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) are different ( see appendix c for discussion on scattering problems in a multi - port system ) .",
    "nevertheless , our system is still a @xmath0-symmetric system without single @xmath1 or @xmath2 symmetry .     under front illumination with @xmath89 ( a ) , and back illumination with @xmath90 ( d ) .",

    "figure 3 depicts the spatial field distribution with a frequency of @xmath80 at oblique incidence .",
    "counter - propagating plane waves are incident from surrounding mediums upon either side of the bilayer md structures . for the case of the downward incidence shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , full transmission could be obtained due to the excitation of @xmath74 mode on the interface .",
    "interestingly , it is found that there exists a purely magnetic field with no electric field along the interface . to see more clearly",
    ", we zoom in and get a close - up view of the magnetic field @xmath93 in the two domains as shown in fig .",
    "3(b)(c ) , with black arrows representing the vector patterns of magnetic field .",
    "the fixed phase difference between @xmath57 and @xmath58 could be observed , such as @xmath59 in the left domain region and @xmath60 at the right .",
    "these results are identical with the derivation of eq.([magnetic ] ) for the infinite system . in contrast , for upward incidence in fig .",
    "3(d ) , such excitation of @xmath74 mode is almost completely suppressed , resulting in low transmission through the structure . therefore a non - reciprocal optical response is attained with one - way tunneling for incident oblique waves through thin films of @xmath0-symmetric bilayer md structure .    .",
    "( c)(d ) are similar to ( a)(b ) , but for another case with a frequency @xmath94 .",
    "these two particular cases are marked in fig .",
    "2(a ) with point a and b , respectively . the vector patterns of power flow in our system are also illustrated with black arrows in ( a)-(d ) .",
    "the mds structure parameters are the same as those used in fig .",
    "the profile of incident gaussian beam is assumed to be @xmath95 ( si unit ) , where @xmath96 determines the arbitrary overall amplitude in the linear regime .",
    "for clear illustration , the power flow of incident waves is also shown by means of big arrows.,width=307 ]    at normal incidence shown in fig .",
    "4 , another interesting phenomenon of non - reciprocal beam shift could be seen by application of the @xmath74 mode through such a finite @xmath0-symmetric structure . in fig .",
    "4(a)(b ) at a frequency of @xmath97 [ corresponding to point a shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , both incoming gaussian waves , including from left or right , undergo an upward lateral - shift perpendicular to the propagation direction after passing through the bilayer mds . meanwhile , by looking inside the magnetic domains at both of incidence cases , the direction of power flow indicated by black arrows always changes by an upswept angle with respect to the power flow of the incoming waves . the beam shift and non - reciprocal behavior can also be understood by the excitation of @xmath74 mode at point a , with an upswept - angle direction of wave group velocity @xmath98 , evaluated as @xmath99 from the dispersion relation of fig .",
    "1(d ) . for comparison , at another resonant frequency of @xmath94 [ corresponding to point b in fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , the incoming waves go straightforward with reciprocal response shown in fig .",
    "4(c)(d ) , because the reciprocal propagating mode is excited with the group velocity at point b keeping along the horizontal direction .",
    "we emphasis that the @xmath0 symmetry in our system is actually not a necessary condition to achieve the spectral non - reciprocity .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath0 symmetry can help achieving perfect transmission mode in one direction as depicted in fig .",
    "for a non-@xmath0-symmetric structure with different applied magnetic field on the two magnetic domains , it is seen that transmission through the entire system would be partly suppressed , and the @xmath74 mode shift slightly .",
    "finally , owing to the possible difficulty in implementation in practice of our proposed finite - size @xmath0-symmetric structures , with two adjoined , but inversely magnetized mds , we consider another structure by separating these two mds with a little displacement , as illustrated in fig .",
    "note that the @xmath74 mode shifts to the lower frequency shown in fig .",
    "5(c ) , due to the variation of the effective index of the structures .     for a non-@xmath0-symmetric bilayer domain structure , with different applied magnetic field @xmath100 on the right domain @xmath101 . here",
    "the applied field on the left domain @xmath102 is fixed with @xmath103 oe , and other parameters are the same with those in fig .",
    "( b ) schematic diagram of two bilayer mds , similar to fig .",
    "1(b ) , but separating them with a little displacement of horizontal distance @xmath104 .",
    "( c ) the reflectance spectra for the structure in ( b ) , with @xmath105 m , and @xmath106 m. other parameters and lines are identical with those in fig .",
    "in summary , we demonstrate a new type of non - reciprocal mu - near - zero radiative mode in the @xmath0-symmetric bilayer mds , magnetized by opposite directions . such an unusual mode occurs close to the frequency when the effective permeability for mds approaches to zero , and could be well excited when the infinite system shrinks to a finite one .",
    "in particular , we see two pronounced non - reciprocal behavior for incident waves : one - way complete optical tunneling for oblique incident waves and unidirectional beam shift for normal incidence . our theoretical results may provide a new way for designing compact isolators .",

    "the @xmath0 symmetry condition @xmath15 for our system has a complex conjugate on permeability tensor , which is associated with @xmath2 operation .",
    "we note that our arguments on time - reversal symmetry are based on the following assumptions :    i. the maxwell s equations themselves are maintained under time reversal of vector fields .",
    "the pseudo - vectors must be modified accordingly ( i.e. , a change in sign ) in order to keep the maxwell s equation unchanged under time - reversal .",
    "the constitutive relations among the fields ( satisfying the maxwell s equations ) in frequency domain may not be the same after time reversal .",
    "therefore , some systems are not time - reversal symmetric .",
    "this part is only about the change in sign related to the maxwell s equation ( not the constitutive relations ) .",
    "assume that we have the four fields ( * e * , * d * , * b * , * h * ) satisfying the maxwell s equations : @xmath107 here , we consider the solutions in source - free regions and check the conditions on the pseudo - vectors @xmath108 and @xmath109 to ensure that the equations are maintained under time reversal of vector fields @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "we denote all the fields after this time - reversal operation as @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , where we already know that @xmath116 and @xmath117 and require that the maxwell s equations must be maintained : @xmath118 one can check that the above equations can be satisfied by the substitutions of @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( as shown below ) : @xmath121 this means that the change in sign of pseudo - vectors is associated with the maxwell s equations .",
    "the above results are not new and well documented in the literature @xcite .",
    "we now consider the constitutive relations in frequency domain using the conclusion in part i. we have the original four fields satisfying the following equations : @xmath122 it is well known that an additional complex conjugate must be applied to the frequency - domain fields when time is reversed .",
    "substituting @xmath123 into @xmath124 will give @xmath125^{*}d\\omega\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\textnormal{re}\\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\textbf{d}^{*}(\\omega)e^{-i\\omega t}d\\omega\\right ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which gives @xmath126 .",
    "together with the conclusion in part i , the fields in frequency domain are @xmath127 if the system is the same under time reversal , one must have @xmath128 the above equations are satisfied by all time - reversed fields in eqs .",
    "( [ trfield1 ] ) and ( [ trfield2 ] ) if @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "finally , we conclude that if we consider the change in sign for pseudo - vectors , the way to break time - reversal symmetry is to make either @xmath131 or @xmath132 .",
    "we start with the 1d transfer matrix @xmath133 from region @xmath134 to @xmath135 [ shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) ] , defined by @xmath136 here , @xmath137 is the total transfer matrix of the bilayer mds structure , and @xmath138 denotes the boundary - condition matrix relating the electric field amplitudes of the forward @xmath139 and backward @xmath140 waves at the interface between the layers @xmath141 and @xmath142 @xmath143 and @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 represents the usual propagation matrix @xmath147 we then obtain the reflection coefficients @xmath148 and @xmath149 for the light incident from left and right : @xmath150 by finding the zeros of the reflectance @xmath151 , we finally obtain the mode solutions for the bilayer mds structure , @xmath152    \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are , respectively , the permittivity and permeability for surrounding medium , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the wave - vector components normal to the interface in background and magnetic materials , respectively .",
    "the solutions are then analytically separated as reciprocal ( symmetrical ) modes [ eq . ( [ symm ] ) ] and non - reciprocal ( asymmetrical ) ones [ eq . ( [ asymm ] ) ] .",

    "<S> the new mode is non - propagating and purely magnetic when the two mds are semi - infinite while it becomes propagating in the finite case . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , two pronounced nonreciprocal responses could be observed via the excitation of this mode : one - way optical tunneling for oblique incidence and unidirectional beam shift at normal incidence . </S>",
    "<S> when the two mds system becomes finite in size , it is found that perfect - transmission mode could be achieved if @xmath0-symmetry is maintained . </S>",
    "<S> the unique properties of such an unusual mode are investigated by analytical modal calculation as well as numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest a new approach to the design of compact optical isolator . </S>"
