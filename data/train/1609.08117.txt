    "microgrids ( mgs ) are localized clusters of small - scale distributed generators ( dgs ) that cover small geographical areas and operate either connected to the main grid or in standalone mode @xcite .",
    "the mg control plane is divided into hierarchy of three levels , comprising the primary , secondary and tertiary control levels @xcite .",
    "primary _ control enables the basic operation of the system by regulating the electrical parameters ( bus voltage and/or frequency ) and keeping the supply - demand power balance to guarantee local stability .",
    "it is implemented in a decentralized manner using the _ droop control law _",
    "@xcite , relying only on the local measurements of the controllers .",
    "the upper , _ secondary _ and _ tertiary _ control levels optimize the performance of the mg in terms of maximizing the quality of the delivered power under minimal operation cost , and , in order to operate properly , require exchange of local information among the controllers .",
    "recent approaches suggest to avoid use of external communication systems for mg control applications , due to related costs , complexity and reliability issues @xcite ; rather , the existing power line equipment is also used for communication @xcite .    in @xcite we introduced _",
    "power talk _ - a communication technique over the power lines , developed for direct current ( dc ) mgs and proposed as an alternative to using external communications for upper layer control .",
    "power talk is an in - band solution that modulates the information into controlled deviations of the parameters of the primary control loops of the dgs . in this way",
    ", a communication channel is induced over the dc bus voltage level through which information - carrying deviations of the voltage ( or , equivalently , power ) are disseminated throughout the system , and received and processed by other dg units .",
    "the control frequency of the primary droop controller is typically between @xmath0 , which implies that power talk is a narrowband powerline communication ( plc ) solution .",
    "it exhibits conceptual similarities with other existing low - rate plc standards for communication in the ac distribution grids , such as ripple carrier , twacs and turtle @xcite , which also rely on disturbing the ( sinusoidal ) voltage wave to transmit information .",
    "however , in contrast to these solutions , power talk requires no additional hardware to generate and process the information signals , as it is implemented in the local primary control loop of the power electronic converters that connect the dgs to the dc buses .",
    "thus , power talk exhibits the self - sustainability feature of the mg paradigm , drawing its reliability from the reliability of the mg system itself .",
    "the power talk communication channel shows some challenging properties that are not commonly encountered in communication systems : i ) non - linear input - output relation , ii ) configurations of primary controllers of all communicating units jointly determine the values of the observed channel outputs , i.e. , voltage / power levels of mg buses , iii ) configurations of primary controllers are also jointly subject to constraints in terms of the allowed supplied power deviations , and iv ) dependence of the channel outputs on the configuration of the rest of the system , i.e. , distribution line impedances and the instantaneous values of the loads that change randomly .",
    "the previous works @xcite investigated the performance of power talk in presence of random load changes , when standard communication techniques , such as line - coding and pilot - sequence based training are applied .",
    "in addition , @xcite focused on a simple single bus dc mg system where the effect of the distribution lines can be ignored and all units observe the same output . in this paper",
    "we expand the analysis of power talk in several ways , as elaborated below .",
    "we assume that a general dc mg with @xmath1 buses , where each bus hosts a single droop controlled dg unit operated as a voltage source , see fig .",
    "[ busarch ] ( more details on dg operation are provided in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] ) .",

    "we consider a variant of power talk in which the signaling is done only through the reference voltage @xmath6 by modulating it around its _ nominal _ value @xmath8 : @xmath9 i.e. , @xmath10 , @xmath5 , are power talk inputs .",
    "the power talk outputs are the deviations of the bus voltages @xmath3 around their nominal values @xmath11 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a non - linear function of the inputs .",
    "this deviations translate into deviations of the output powers @xmath14 around their nominal values @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is also a non - linear function of the inputs .",
    "further , in order to maintain the quality of the supplied power , which is one of the main goals of the mg operation , the variances of @xmath18 should be bounded : @xmath19 \\leq \\pi_n^2 , \\ ;",
    "n=1, ... ,n,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the power deviation budget of unit @xmath2 .    under the assumption that the reference voltage deviations are small compared to their nominal values , in this paper",
    "we derive the linearized models : @xmath21 & = \\sum_{m=1}^n\\breve{\\phi}_{n , m}^2\\mathbb{e}[\\delta x_m^2 ] , n = 1, ... ,n,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 , i.e. , they are functions of virtual resistances , as shown in sections  [ sec : discretetimelinearmodel ] and [ sec : communicationarchitetures ] . in other words ,",
    "the resulting linearized model is such that the units can _ control _ the channel gains @xmath24 through the values of @xmath7 , @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , using and , we show that constraints on the individual signals @xmath10 are obtained as solutions of a linear system of inequalities , jointly imposed on droop parameters of all units . in section [ sec : casestudy ] we show how to exploit the above properties to optimize the received snr of the observations of the channel outputs .",
    "specifically , we show that , when the output @xmath26 is affected by gaussian noise , the received snr can be maximized by optimizing the virtual resistances @xmath7 under power deviation budgets @xmath20 , @xmath27 .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : snrmaximization ] , we present an algorithm to obtain the optimal values of the virtual resistances .",
    "we conclude by noting that the power talk schemes assessed in @xcite can be derived as special instances of the communication framework developed in this paper .",
    "fig .  [ busarch ] depicts the architecture of a bus in a dc mg system with @xmath1 buses , where @xmath3 denotes the steady state bus voltage . without loss of generality , we assume that each bus hosts a single dg , connected to the distribution infrastructure through a power electronic converter . on the primary control level , the converter is configured as a voltage source converter ( vsc ) @xcite , regulating the bus voltage using the droop law @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the output current , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the _ reference voltage _ and the _ virtual resistance _ ( i.e. , _ droop slope _ ) , respectively , whose values are subject to control .",
    "the reference voltage @xmath6 corresponds to the rated voltage of the mg @xcite , while the virtual resistance @xmath7 is set to enable proportional load sharing among the dgs .",
    "the nominal values of these parameters , when not using power talk , are denoted with @xmath30 and @xmath31 , corresponding to the nominal bus voltage @xmath11 .",
    "each bus also hosts a collection of local loads , modeled by a resistance @xmath32 , constant current @xmath33 and constant power @xmath34 components connected in parallel , see fig .",
    "[ busarch ] ; the loads change randomly through time .",
    "the buses are interconnected through dc distribution lines .",
    "the resistance of the line between buses @xmath2 and @xmath35 is denoted with @xmath36 , see fig .",
    "[ busarch ] : by convention , @xmath37 if @xmath38 or if buses @xmath2 and @xmath35 are not directly connected .",
    "we write : @xmath39 to denote the equivalent bus - to - the - ground resistance of bus @xmath2 , including the resistive component of the load .",
    "all voltages , currents , powers and impedances in dc systems are real numbers @xcite .",
    "the physical behavior of the system is governed by the ohm s and kirchoff s laws : applying them for the system shown in fig .",
    "[ busarch ] , we obtain the following current balance equation for bus @xmath5 in steady state @xcite : @xmath40 which yields : @xmath41 the unique , physically viable solution to is the positive root ; it can be easily verified that the solution is real if the droop parameters satisfy the following condition : @xmath42 this system of inequalities defines the ranges of allowable values for the droop control parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we proceed by developing a linearized model for all - to - all full duplex communication scenario , where all vsc units simultaneously transmit and receive data .",
    "we assume that the time is slotted in slots of duration @xmath43 and the units are slot - synchronized . is set to comply with the control frequency of the primary controller ; its value is typically of the order of milliseconds to allow the system to establish steady - state . ] in slot @xmath44 , the reference voltage of vsc @xmath2 is : @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the _ input _ signal .",
    "then , the resulting deviation of the bus voltage in slot @xmath44 can be written as : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the _ output _ of the communication channel .",
    "vsc @xmath2 samples the noisy version of @xmath49 with frequency @xmath50 and uses the average of @xmath51 samples over the slot @xmath44 to obtain the observation : @xmath52 where noise @xmath53 can be modeled as an additive gaussian noise @xcite . finally , we assume that the loads in the system changes randomly with a rate that is much lower than the signaling rate @xmath54 and that the signaling is done over a single realization of the load values .",
    "assume that the reference voltage deviations @xmath46 , @xmath5 ,",
    "are small : @xmath55 under this assumption , we use the first - order taylor approximation of around @xmath30 to obtain the linear model : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is given with : @xmath58 we introduce the following notation :    * input @xmath59 vector @xmath60^t$ ] , * output @xmath59 vector @xmath61^t$ ] , * admittance matrix @xmath62 of dimension @xmath63 , with entries : @xmath64 * modified admittance matrix @xmath65 in which each diagonal entry is multiplied by @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath67 , * the @xmath63 matrix @xmath68 , * the @xmath63 matrix @xmath69 , * the @xmath63 matrix @xmath70 .    using and the above notation , the linearized input - output relation can be compactly written as follows : @xmath71 we refer to the matrix @xmath72 as the _ channel _ matrix of the system .",
    "finally , we obtain the following linear model for the noisy output observed by vsc @xmath2 : @xmath73 where @xmath24 is the entry at position @xmath74 of the channel matrix ; it can be shown that @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "we conclude by noting that the resulting linearized power talk communication channel is an all - to - all full duplex gaussian multiple access channel @xcite , provided that the channel coefficients @xmath24 , @xmath77 , are known .",
    "the channel coefficients @xmath24 determine how strongly the input @xmath78 influences the output observed by vsc @xmath2 ; @xmath24 is a function of 1 ) the instantaneous values of all loads , 2 ) the line impedances and 3 ) the virtual resistances of the vscs , which are controllable .",
    "thus , the values of the channel coefficients can be _ modified _ through the virtual resistances : @xmath79 the optimized values of @xmath7 , denoted with @xmath80 , is fixed during the transmission and , in general case , is different from the nominal value @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath81 .",
    "this phenomenon represents a major difference from standard communication scenarios . in the rest of the paper",
    "we assume that the functional relation @xmath82 is _ known _ @xmath76 .",
    "this assumption implies knowledge of the impedances of the distribution lines and the values of the loads , i.e. , knowledge on the matrices @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 for given power demand .",
    "such knowledge can be available _ a priori _ ( typically , in demand - response scenarios , the load values are available through forecast @xcite ) , or it can be obtained through estimation of @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( this aspect is out of the paper scope ) .    in the case",
    "when the system does not host non - linear loads , i.e. , when @xmath86 , @xmath87 , then @xmath88 and @xmath89 , i.e. , it is equal to the @xmath63 identity matrix . in this case",
    "the linear model is exact and obtains the form : @xmath90    * remark : * from an information - theoretic viewpoint , one can actually send additional information by _ modulating _ the virtual resistances .",
    "in addition , the channel can be also optimized over the reference voltages .",
    "particularly , generalizing the above communication scheme , we write : @xmath91 assuming that @xmath46 and @xmath92 are small , relative to @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively , and applying taylor s expansion we obtain the following linearized model : @xmath95 where @xmath96 represent the gains on the channel used to transmit information through the virtual resistances .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath97 and @xmath98 , i.e. , the channel can be optimized over both the virtual resistances _ and _ the reference voltages . in this paper",
    ", we treat the special case : 1 ) @xmath99 , @xmath100 , i.e. , the reference voltages are only used for signaling and , 2 ) @xmath101 , i.e. , the virtual resistances are not information - carrying , and act only as state variables over which the linearized channel is optimized ( for notational convenience , we omit the overline symbol in @xmath102 ) .",
    "we characterize some of the basic properties of the channel coefficients through a simple case of a single bus systems and note that the same observations hold for multibus systems .",
