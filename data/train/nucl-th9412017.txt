    "one can attempt to resolve this `` spin problem '' by studying the strange - quark contribution to the vector ( both electric and magnetic ) and axial - vector form factors of the nucleon .",

    "thus , this large difference in @xmath0 is sufficient to change the value of @xmath2 extracted from the bnl experiment and the conclusion of a nonzero strange - quark content from our previous neutral - current study  @xcite . therefore determining the precise value of @xmath0 is important for strangeness studies .    at relatively high momentum transfer",

    "the cross sections are considerably reduced relative to neutrinos because of the sign change in the vector - axial interference term [ see eq .",

    "in addition , since the cross sections fall to ( almost ) zero for @xmath130  gev@xmath126 , most of the quasifree strength is located below the cutoff @xmath131 .",
    "hence , the kinematical cutoff does not have a significant effect on the @xmath34 curve at large @xmath129 . at a smaller momentum transfer , @xmath125  gev@xmath126 , and just as in the neutrino case , rpa correlations substantially reduce the cross section . at a larger @xmath129 ,",
    "most of the differences observed between the rpa and the impulse with @xmath33 calculations are due to the strong scalar potential .",

    "( [ gax ] ) ] , was extracted from antineutrino data using a fermi gas ( i.e. , impulse with @xmath33 ) formalism . from an analysis of their data in the range @xmath132  gev@xmath126",
    ", the bnl group extracted a value of @xmath133 ( stat)@xmath134  ( syst )  gev . in fig .",
    "[ bnlfig ] we show the cross section , @xmath119 , averaged over the bnl neutrino spectrum . in fig .",
    "[ bnlfig ]  ( a ) we present four different calculations : impulse and rpa with @xmath33 ( solid lines ) , and impulse and rpa with @xmath34 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the two curves using the free nucleon mass @xmath33 start to overlap at @xmath135  gev@xmath126 and , insofar as we can regard them as our nonrelativistic limit , they agree with the nonrelativistic results obtained by singh and oset  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the two @xmath34 curves also coincide for @xmath136  gev@xmath126 illustrating the fact that rpa correlations become unimportant in this @xmath129 region . in fig .",
    "[ bnlfig ]  ( b ) we show three impulse curves in the @xmath132  gev@xmath126 range  the region sampled in the bnl experiment . at @xmath137",
    "there is a 6 percent difference between the impulse with @xmath33 calculation and the @xmath34 and @xmath106 values .",
    "this difference becomes larger , 2030 percent , at @xmath138  gev@xmath126 .",
    "it is , therefore , essential to estimate the sensitivity of @xmath139 to these nuclear - structure effects .",
    "the raw experimental data as a function of the four - momentum transfer @xmath128  was fitted with a theoretical curve to determine @xmath0 . since the experiment suffers from an uncertainty in the overall normalization , we use the ratio of the cross section at two different values of @xmath129 to extract @xmath139 . in table  [ compa ] we show the ratio of the cross section using @xmath140  gev@xmath126 and @xmath138  gev@xmath126 .",
    "the value of the axial - mass parameter @xmath139 was varied in the @xmath141  gev range and the ratio of cross sections reported for various nuclear - structure models . for @xmath142  gev",
    " the value extracted from the bnl data  the impulse with @xmath33 ratio equals 19.42 .",
    "this represents our baseline value for the ratio . in order to reproduce this value using the impulse with @xmath105 calculation the value of the axial - mass",
    "must be changed to @xmath143  gev ( a 20 percent increase ) .",
    "similarly , the value of @xmath139 must be changed to 1.25 gev in the rpa with @xmath34 and to 1.20 gev in the @xmath106 calculation .",
    "there is , however , no @xmath0 value within this range that can reproduce the ratio using an rpa with @xmath33 calculation .",
    "this is because rpa effects substantially reduces the cross section at @xmath140 ( about 10 percent ) which was not expected from nonrelativistic calculations .",
    "since we have established that rpa correlations become unimportant for @xmath136  gev@xmath126 , we can eliminate the sensitivity to rpa effects by computing the ratio of cross sections using @xmath144  gev@xmath126 and @xmath138  gev@xmath126 ( see table  [ compa1 ] ) . in this case , using the impulse with @xmath33 calculation we obtain a baseline value for the ratio of 5.47 at @xmath142  gev .",
    "now the rpa with @xmath33 does not induce any change in the value of @xmath0  in agreement with the nonrelativistic calculation of singh and oset  @xcite .",
    "this , however , is not the case for the other nuclear - structure calculations . indeed , even in the impulse with @xmath106 calculation  which generates the smallest change  a 10 percent increase in the value of @xmath139 is required .",
    "this 10 percent uncertainty in the value of @xmath0 could complicate the extraction of strange - quark matrix elements from experimental studies of neutral weak form factors  @xcite .",
    "we have used a relativistic formalism to study inclusive charged - current neutrino scattering in an impulse approximation . the nuclear - structure information is contained in a large set of nuclear - response functions that were evaluated in nuclear matter using a variety of approximations . the simplest approximation that we considered was a relativistic free fermi gas .",
    "this approximation was used by the bnl group to extract the axial mass parameter @xmath139 .",
    "we have used the fermi - gas approximation  together with the bnl - extracted value of @xmath145  gev  to fix the @xmath129 dependence of the inclusive cross section .",
    "we have examined the sensitivity of this extracted value for @xmath139 to various nuclear - structure effects  such as the ones arising from the mean fields ( @xmath105 ) , rpa correlations , and momentum - dependent self - energies .",
    "in essence , we have computed the changes in @xmath139 that were required to reproduce the baseline free fermi gas cross section once these additional nuclear - structure effects were taken into consideration .",
    "this analysis is useful because a robust value of @xmath139 is essential for a reliable determination of the strange - quark content of the nucleon .",
    "our results indicate important corrections to the nuclear response due to the mean fields ( @xmath105 ) and to rpa correlations .",
    "indeed , changes as large as 20 percent in @xmath139 were observed whenever the whole range of @xmath129 values ( @xmath146 ) used in the bnl experiment were employed for the extraction .",
    "this uncertainty , however , can be substantially reduced .",
    "for example , it is well known that rpa correlations are effective only at small momentum transfers ( i.e. , @xmath147  gev@xmath148 ) .",
    "in addition , phenomenological fits to the nucleon optical potential indicate that , at large nucleon momenta , the mean fields are considerably smaller in magnitude than the ones predicted by the mean - field theory .",
    "hence , some of the nuclear - structure uncertainties can be removed by employing phenomenological ( momentum - dependent ) mean fields and by restricting the range of @xmath129 to the region @xmath149 .",
    "note that , although weaker than in the mean - field theory , the momentum - dependent optical potentials are still large and induce nontrivial changes in the effective mass and energy of a particle in the medium .",
    "indeed , even in this best - case scenario a 10 percent uncertainty in @xmath139 persists . with this extra 10 percent uncertainty ,",
    "the bnl experiment  @xcite by itself no longer provides strong evidence for a nonzero strangeness content of the nucleon  @xcite .    in the future",
    "we will employ the present relativistic rpa formalism to calculate the inclusive cross section for atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos have been observed over a wide range of energies ( from a few hundred mev to several gev ) in large water erenkov detectors  hence the need for a formalism that can address neutrino physics over this broad energy range .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos are particularly interesting because of the current flavor anomaly in the @xmath150 ratio .",
    "this anomaly might signal neutrino oscillations . however , first one must rule out all conventional nuclear effects .",
    "thus , it is important to examine these nuclear - structure corrections before a definitive statement about new physics can be made .",
