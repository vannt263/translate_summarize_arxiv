    "the type ia supernova observations suggest that the expansion of the universe is speeding up rather than slowing down ( @xcite,1999 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the measurements of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background favor a flat universe ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observation of type ia supernova sn 1997ff at @xmath4 also supports that the universe was in the deceleration phase in the recent past @xcite .",
    "the transition from the deceleration phase to the acceleration phase happened around the redshift @xmath5 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a form of matter with negative pressure widely referred as dark energy is usually introduced to explain the accelerating expansion .",
    "the simplest form of dark energy is the cosmological constant with the equation of state @xmath6 .",
    "the cosmological constant model can be easily generalized to dynamical cosmological constant models , such as the dark energy model with the equation of state @xmath7 , where the constant @xmath8 satisfies @xmath9 .",
    "if we remove the null energy restriction @xmath10 to allow supernegative @xmath11 , then we get the phantom energy models ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more exotic equation of state is also possible , such as the chaplygin gas model with the equation of state @xmath12 and the generalized chaplygin gas model with the equation of state @xmath13 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in general , a scalar field @xmath14 that slowly evolves down its potential @xmath15 takes the role of a dynamical cosmological constant ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite,1998 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite,2004 ) .",
    "the scalar field @xmath14 is also called the quintessence field .",
    "the energy density of the quintessence field must remain very small compared to that of radiation and matter at early epoches and evolves in a way that it started to dominate the universe around the redshift @xmath16 .",
    "there are other forms of dark energy , like the tachyon field ( @xcite ; @xcite,2003 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although dark energy models are consistent with current observations , the nature of dark energy is still a mystery .",
    "therefore it is possible that the observations show a sign of the breakdown of the standard cosmology .",
    "some alternative models to dark energy models were proposed along this line of reasoning .",
