    "in the last several years remarkable progress has been made in numerical studies of lattice qcd at finite temperature @xmath2 and quark chemical potential @xmath3 .",

    "the study of the endpoint of the first order phase transition line in the @xmath6 plane is particularly important both from the experimental and theoretical point of view .",
    "this existence of such a critical point is suggested by phenomenological studies @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the critical endpoint in the @xmath6 plane is closely related to hadronic fluctuations in heavy ion collisions and may be experimentally examined by an event - by - event analysis of heavy ion collisions .",
    "although many trials have been made to prove the existence of the critical endpoint by first principle calculation in lattice qcd , no definite conclusion on this issue is obtained so far . the first trial to find the critical endpoint by numerical simulations",
    "was performed in ref .",

    "the difficulty in the lee - yang zero method for finite density qcd is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . the radius of convergence in the framework of the taylor expansion of the grand canonical potential can establish a lower bound on the location of the critical endpoint @xcite .",
    "there are also studies in which the behavior of the critical endpoint as a function of the quark masses is examined by using the property that a critical endpoint exists at @xmath4 in the very small quark mass region for qcd with three flavors having degenerate quark masses @xcite .",
    "moreover , studies by simulations of phase - quenched finite density qcd , have been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this study is to clarify the existence of the endpoint of the first order phase transition line in the @xmath6 plane .",
    "we propose a new method to investigate the nature of transition . in the study of finite density lattice",
    "qcd , the reweighting method @xcite plays an important role .",
    "however , the calculation of physical quantities becomes increasingly more difficult for large @xmath5 due to the sign problem @xcite .",
    "we also consider a way to avoid the sign problem .",
    "we evaluate an effective potential as a function of the average plaquette , and identify the type of transition from the shape of the potential .",
    "the partition function can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the plaquette value , @xmath10 is the gauge action , @xmath11 is the state density at @xmath4 for each @xmath9 , and @xmath12 is the modification factor for finite @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath12 is obtained by calculating the quark determinant @xmath13 and is assumed to be real and positive .",
    "we then define the effective potential as @xmath14 .",
    "if there is a first order phase transition point , where two different states coexist , the potential must have two minima at two different values of @xmath9 .",
    "however , the calculation of the quark determinant is quite expensive and is actually difficult except on small lattices .",
    "moreover , the sign problem is serious when we calculate @xmath12 directly .",
    "this study is based on the following two ideas to avoid these problems .",
    "one is that we perform a taylor expansion of @xmath15 in terms of @xmath5 around @xmath4 and calculate the expansion coefficients , as proposed in ref .",
    "the taylor expansion coefficients are rather easy to calculate by using the stochastic noise method .",
    "although we must cut off this expansion at an appropriate order in @xmath5 , we can estimate the application range where the approximation is valid for each analysis .",
    "while the application range of the taylor expansion of @xmath16 should be limited by the critical point because @xmath16 is singular at the critical point , there is no such limit for the application range in the expansion of @xmath17 because the weight factor should always be well - defined .",
    "this discussion is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : taylor ] .",
    "the second idea is that we consider the probability distribution function in terms of the complex phase of the quark determinant @xmath18 when @xmath9 and @xmath19 are fixed .",
    "we assume the distribution function is well - approximated by a gaussian function , and perform the integration over @xmath18 .",
    "if we adopt this assumption , the sign problem in the calculation of @xmath17 is completely solved .",
    "this assumption is reasonable for sufficiently large volume and is suggested by the simulation results given in this study .",
    "we discuss this method in sec .",
    "[ sec : sign ] .",
    "general remarks on the phase transition in lattice qcd are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : tran ] , and an effective potential as a function of the average plaquette is introduced .",
    "we discuss the reweighting method for the study of the qcd phase structure at non - zero temperature and density in sec .",
    "[ sec : rew ] .",
    "we evaluate the effective potential using data obtained with two - flavors of p4-improved staggered quarks in ref .",
    "we also discuss the phase structure of qcd with isospin chemical potential .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "the grand canonical partition function of lattice qcd is given by @xmath20 and the expectation value of an operator @xmath21 is calculated by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the quark matrix .",
    "@xmath24 is the number of flavors .",
    "when one use a staggered type quark action , @xmath24 is replaced by @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 is the gauge action , which is given by a linear combination of the wilson loops @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the size , direction and position of the wilson loop , respectively , @xmath31 is a simulation parameter related to the gauge coupling @xmath32 being @xmath7 .",
    "the simplest gauge action is the standard plaquette action given by the following equation , @xmath33 because the @xmath34 wilson loop is defined on an elementary square ( plaquette ) , @xmath35 is usually called plaquette or plaquette variable .    in a monte carlo simulation ,",
    "we generate configurations of link variables @xmath36 with the probability in proportion to the weight factor @xmath37 and the state density of @xmath36 .",
    "the expectation value is then estimated by taking an average of the operator @xmath38 $ ] over the generated configurations @xmath36 .",

    "this is the average of the plaquette over all elementary squares for the standard gauge action , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sgplaq ] ) .",
    "@xmath43 is the number of sites . using the distribution function ,",
    "the expectation value can be rewritten as @xmath44 \\rangle_{(\\beta ) }   = \\frac{1}{\\cal z } \\int { \\cal o}[p ] \\",

( [ eq : pdist ] ) , we actually use an approximate delta function such as a box type function , @xmath46 , or a gaussian function , @xmath47 $ ] . for the case of the box type ,",
    "we can estimate @xmath11 by counting the number of configurations for each value of @xmath9 with the width of box @xmath48 .",
    "as @xmath48 decreases , the approximation becomes better but the statistical error becomes large because the number of configurations in each block becomes small .",
    "hence , we must adjust the size of @xmath48 appropriately .",
    "next , we discuss the shape of the probability distribution function . in general , the number of states increases exponentially as the gauge fields become random .",
    "on the other hand , the random configurations are exponentially suppressed by the weight factor @xmath49 , since the plaquette is one when the gauge field is @xmath50 uniformly ( free gas limit ) and @xmath9 decreases as the configuration becomes random .",
    "therefore , the most probable @xmath9 is determined by the balance of the number of states and the weight factor , and the value of plaquette variable distributes around the most probable value for each point and each configuration .",
    "we first consider the case that there is no spatial correlation between the plaquette variables at each point and the volume is sufficiently large . in this case , the shape of the probability distribution as a function of the plaquette averaged over the space must be a gaussian function . the central limit theorem tells us that the probability distribution of the average of the random numbers which have the same probability distribution is always of gaussian type when the set of random numbers is large enough .",
    "we can apply this theorem in this case .",
    "hence , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the expectation value of @xmath9 and @xmath53 is the susceptibility , @xmath54    we expect that @xmath11 is of gaussian type also for more general interacting cases when the correlation length is much shorter than the size of the system .",
    "if we divide the space into domains which are larger than the correlation length and average the plaquette variables in these domains , the averaged plaquettes can be independent for each domain . when the number of domains is large , the distribution function as a function of the plaquette averaged over space must be a gaussian function .",
    "however , we do expect that the probability distribution function is not of gaussian type for the following two cases .",
    "one is , of course , the case that the correlation length is not small in comparison to the size of the system because the above - mentioned argument can not be applied .",
    "the other case is that the most probable values of plaquette is not unique . for this case",
    ", the whole space is separated into domains having different states , and the plaquette variables in each domain distribute around one of the most probable values of plaquette .",
    "although , on the surface separating these domains , the most probable plaquette value may not be realized , the effect from the wall becomes smaller as the volume increases , since the effect from the wall increases as a function of the area of the wall .",
    "consequently , the existence of the domain wall does not affect the probability in the infinite volume limit .",
    "the probability distribution function should then be flat in the range between these most probable values of @xmath9 because the spatial average of @xmath9 depends on the size of these domains but the probability does not change in this range .",
    "however , in a finite volume , the effect from the domain wall can not be neglected , hence the distribution function has two peaks when the number of most probable values for @xmath9 is two . clearly the two exceptions discussed here correspond to the case at a second order phase transition point and at a first order phase transition point , respectively .    here",
    ", it is convenient to introduce the effective potential defined by @xmath55 as discussed above , the distribution function is normally written as @xmath56 .",
    "when one considers a taylor expansion of @xmath57 around the minimum @xmath58 , where the slope of the potential @xmath59 is zero , the effective potential is dominated by the second order term in the region near the minimum , i.e. the potential is a quadratic function in the vicinity of @xmath58 , and the second derivative ( curvature ) of @xmath57 at @xmath58 is related to the plaquette susceptibility with @xmath60    a second order phase transition point is characterized by the slope and curvature of the effective potential .",
    "the slope @xmath59 and curvature @xmath61 become zero simultaneously at the critical point . as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gcoe ] ) , @xmath53 is an indicator of fluctuations and diverges at a second order phase transition point in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "when the susceptibility @xmath53 becomes large in the vicinity of a second order phase transition point , the effect from the second order term of @xmath57 becomes small in comparison to the higher order terms , and then the distribution function deviates from a gaussian function . on the other hand , in the case of a first order phase transition point ,",
    "more than one peak exist in the distribution function .",
    "this means that there are points which give @xmath62 more than once , and the curvature of @xmath57 may be negative around the mean value of @xmath9 .    at the end of this section , we should also discuss the relation between the plaquette distribution function and the fourth order binder cumulant , @xmath63 which often is used to identify the nature of a phase transition @xcite .",
    "the value of the binder cumulant at a second order critical point depends on the universality class . in the case of a first order phase transition , assuming the plaquette distribution is a double peaked function , the binder cumulant is estimated as @xmath64 where the distance between two peaks is @xmath65 and is wider than the width of each peak . on the other hand , when the distribution function can be modeled by a gaussian function for a crossover transition or at a normal point , the binder cumulant is given by @xmath66 in a region where a first order phase transition changes to a crossover , the binder cumulant changes rapidly from one to three .",
    "we expect to find such a region for full qcd at high temperature and density .",
    "in addition , the method of lee - yang zeros has been used to identify the nature of the phase transition .",
    "the relation between the plaquette distribution function and the scaling analysis of the lee - yang zero has been discussed in ref .",
    "the scaling behavior of the lee - yang zero can be also explained by the plaquette distribution function .",
    "hence , the distribution function of the plaquette plays an important role in the investigation of the nature of a phase transition .",
    "the most difficult problem for lattice studies at finite baryon density is that the boltzmann weight is complex when the chemical potential is non - zero . in this case , the monte - carlo method is not applicable directly , since configurations can not be generated with a complex probability .",
    "a popular approach to avoid this problem is the reweighting method .",
    "we perform simulations at @xmath4 , and incorporate the remaining part of the correct boltzmann weight for finite @xmath5 in the calculation of expectation values .",
    "expectation values @xmath67 at @xmath68 are thus computed by a simulation at @xmath69 using the following identity , @xmath70 this is the basic formula of the reweighting method .",
    "however , because @xmath15 is complex , the calculations of the numerator and denominator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : murew ] ) becomes in practice increasingly more difficult for larger @xmath5 .",
    "we define the phase of the quark determinant @xmath18 by the imaginary part of @xmath71 .",
    "if the typical value of @xmath18 becomes larger than @xmath72 , the real part of @xmath73 @xmath74 changes its sign frequently . eventually both the numerator and denominator of eq .",

    "furthermore , in the framework of the hadron resonance gas model at low temperature , the isospin susceptibility correspond to fluctuations of pions , and the pion mass is more sensitive to the quark mass than baryon masses .",
    "therefore , when the quark mass is decreased , the pion mass becomes smaller and the fluctuation becomes larger at low temperature .",
    "this suggests the change of @xmath170 around @xmath177 may be milder at small quark mass , i.e. the difference between @xmath95 and @xmath162 becomes large at small quark mass .    for more precise arguments on the phase structure ,",
    "more accurate evaluations of @xmath79 and @xmath157 are required increasing the number of terms in the taylor expansion of @xmath99 . however",
    ", the qualitative property that the critical value of @xmath75 in the @xmath6 plane is smaller than the critical @xmath158 in the @xmath178 plane can be understood by the well - known properties of the quark ( baryon ) number and isospin susceptibilities combined with the argument of the effective potential .",
    "we have discussed the phase structure of lattice qcd at non - zero density . the probability distribution as a function of the plaquette",
    "was estimated at non - zero temperature and chemical potential using the data obtained with two - flavors of p4-improved staggered quarks in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this analysis ,",
    "we have adopted two approximations .",
    "one is that we estimate @xmath99 from the data of a taylor expansion up to @xmath116 .",
    "terms of higher order than @xmath179 are omitted .",
    "we have estimated the range where this approximation is valid and studied in the reliability range .",
    "the second approximation is an assumption on the probability distribution for the complex phase .",
    "we have assumed the distribution function to be a gaussian function .",
    "this assumption will be valid for sufficiently large volume and we have checked that the distribution is well - approximated by a gaussian function for the data used in this analysis .    in spite of the use of these approximations , it is found that the shape of the effective potential which is of gaussian type at @xmath4 changes to a double - well type at large @xmath75 .",
    "this property is related closely to a well - known behavior of the quark number susceptibility at @xmath4 , i.e. the rapid increase near the phase transition point . for the quantitative estimation of the endpoint of the first order phase transition , further investigation must be needed . however",
    ", this argument strongly suggests the existence of the first order phase transition line in the @xmath6 plane .",
    "we also discussed the difference between qcd with a quark chemical potential and qcd with an isospin chemical potential , and found that the critical value of the quark chemical potential seems to be smaller than that of the isospin chemical potential .",
