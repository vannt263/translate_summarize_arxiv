    "the pearcey integral was first evaluated numerically by pearcey @xcite in his investigation of the electromagnetic field near a cusp .",
    "the integral appears also in optics @xcite , in the asymptotics of special functions @xcite , in probability theory @xcite , as the generating function of heat ( and hence hermite ) polynomials of order @xmath6 for @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it also falls into the category of functions considered by plya @xcite , that is functions with countably many zeros . for the numerical evaluation of the zeros of the pearcey integral",
    "see for instance @xcite , this will be important since this zeros will correspond to the initial value of each function @xmath8 .",
    "the main motivation in finding the zeros of the pearcey function , which solves the heat equation @xmath9 is due to the fact that the main building block used to construct the density of the first time that a wiener process hits a boundary @xmath10 , is to find a function @xmath10 such that @xmath11 for example , suppose there is a financial contract which will be activated if ever the price of an asset @xmath12 ( modelled as brownian motion ) reaches a prescribed boundary @xmath10 .",
    "for instance , in figure [ fig007 ] the blue line represents the evolution of the price of @xmath13 , for @xmath14 $ ] , in turn the red line represents a boundary which activates a contract if it is ever reached . in particular , the barrier option is a contract of this type . for a more detailed exposition",
    "see for instance @xcite .",
    ", in turn , the solid line represents a boundary which will activate a contract the first time it is reached . in this example the contract was activated approximately at time @xmath15 .",
    "this is a random time , since it would have been impossible to foresee the outcome.[fig007 ] , width=340,height=264 ]    next , we note that for some constant @xmath16 , the function @xmath17 with @xmath18 , solves the heat equation ( [ heat ] ) .",
    "this is true since @xmath19 in ( [ linear1 ] ) is a linear combination of the fundamental solution of ( [ heat ] ) and its first derivative with respect to the space variable @xmath20 .",
    "it is clear that the function ( [ linear1 ] ) equals zero at @xmath21 .",
    "hence , for any @xmath22 , and setting @xmath23 in ( [ linear1 ] ) we obtain @xmath24 we note that the right - hand side of this identity is in fact the density of the first time that a brownian motion hits a linear boundary @xcite . in practice these results are used for instance in ( a ) the valuation problem of financial assets , in particular in the valuation of _ barrier options _ [ see bjrk ( 2009 ) ] , ( b ) in the quantificaction of counterparty risk [ see davis and pistorious ( 2010 ) ] , and in general in physical problems .",
    "the main contributions of this work are , on the one hand , finding the zeros of the pearcey integral . on the other , advancing in the direction of developing a rather simple and straightforward methodology to find explicit solutions of the time - varying boundary problem for the heat equation . in this",
    "regard we note that there exist techniques to study the latter aforementioned problem in terms of solutions to integral equations @xcite .",
    "we recall that solutions in terms of integral equations , in general can only be evaluated numerically . in turn",
    ", our approach leads to solutions in terms of odes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secairy ]",
    "we introduce the airy function of order 4 .",
    "next in section [ secpearcey ] we define the pearcey integral and describe its connection with the airy function of order 4 . in section [ secrayleigh ]",
    "we derive a rayleigh - type equation , whose solution kills the pearcey function .",
    "the techniques described in section [ secrayleigh ] are illustrated with examples in section [ secexamples ] . in section [ secasymptotic ]",
    "we derive a function which asymptotically solves the moving boundary problem for the pearcey integral .",
    "this approximation can be helpful in the numerical solution of the rayleigh equation .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusions ] , with some final remarks .",
    "with respect to the zeros of fourier integrals , plya proved @xcite that all the zeros of @xmath25 are real and infinitely many for @xmath26 . in turn",
    ", the generalized airy function @xmath27 of order 4 can be expressed as a solution of the following ode @xmath28 one can prove , for instance applying the fourier transform to ( [ ai ] ) and solving the resulting equation , that @xmath27 is a particular case of ( [ poleq ] ) when @xmath29 , namely @xmath30 furthermore function @xmath27 is symmetric , with countably many zeros in the real line  hence oscillatory  and tends to zero as it increases to @xmath31 , see figure [ fig00 ] .",
    "regarding the zeros of ( [ airy4 ] ) , there exist asymptotic estimates which are derived by means of the method of steepest descent @xcite .    ,",
    "defined in ( [ airy4 ] ) .",
    "we observe the function is even and its first zero is at @xmath32.,width=340,height=264 ]",
    "paris @xcite analyzed the asymptotic behavior of    @xmath33    which by rotation of the path of integration @xmath34 and use of jordan s lemma ( see @xcite ) can be expressed as @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in particular , the pearcey integral , which solves ( [ heat ] ) , is the case @xmath38 .",
    "more explicitly , we have the following .",
    "@xcitethe pearcey integral is defined as @xmath39    in this work we study instead the following fourier integral @xmath40 because the zeros of @xmath4 , for @xmath18 , are expressed in terms of a continuously differentiable function @xmath10 , as opposed to ( [ p2 ] )",
    ". see @xcite .",
    "we observe that the function @xmath4 in ( [ pearcey ] ) is the convolution between the kernel of standard brownian motion and the generalized airy function of order 4 , in equation ( [ ai ] ) .",
    "throughout this work , the @xmath41-th partial differentiation with respect to the space variable @xmath20 of any given function @xmath42 is denoted as @xmath43 .    in this section",
    "we find the function @xmath10 for which the pearcey function is zero for every @xmath2 .",
    "the idea is to exploit , on the one hand , the differential form of the airy function of order 4 , defined in ( [ ai ] ) , and on the other to use the fact that the pearcey function solves the heat equation ( [ heat ] ) .",

    "then , for every @xmath2 , we have @xmath49    given that @xmath27 is as in ( [ airy4 ] ) , its fourier transform equals @xmath50 furthermore , if we apply the fourier transform directly to the ode ( [ ai ] ) we have that @xmath51 since this expression is already in fourier domain , we convolve the previous expression with the heat kernel as follows @xmath52 this in turn , and by direct application of the integration by parts formula , yields @xmath53 as well as @xmath54 after differentiation with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "next given that there exists an @xmath10 , see plya @xcite , such that the following holds for all @xmath55 @xmath56 we differentiate ( leibniz integral rule ) @xmath4 with @xmath57 , defined in ( [ pearcey ] ) , with respect to @xmath55 to obtain @xmath58 which is equivalent to @xmath59 and @xmath60 after differentiation with respect to @xmath55 twice .",
    "we note that equations ( [ ai41 ] ) and ( [ ai42 ] ) obtained from the airy differential equation ( [ ai ] ) , as well as ( [ hit ] ) and ( [ hit2 ] ) obtained from the heat equation , involve derivatives of @xmath4 up to order 4 .",
