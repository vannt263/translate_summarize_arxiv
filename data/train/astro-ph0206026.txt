    "hierarchical clustering governed by cold dark matter ( cdm ) is widely believed as a cosmological scenario which is responsible for the growth of the structures in the universe . according to the hierarchical scenario",
    ", small dark matter halos should collapse earlier , but later fall into larger structures .",
    "the process of smaller halos being assembled into a larger halo does not always destroy the smaller ones , thus hierarchical structures are seen in many objects , such as clusters of galaxies .",
    "recent high - resolution simulations have successfully shown that hundreds of galaxy - size dm halos survive in clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "a remarkable outcome of the high - resolution cosmological simulation in standard cdm model by @xcite even shows that survival of substructures or satellites occurs not only on cluster scales , but also on galactic scales .",
    "they show that a galaxy of a similar size as the milky way should contain about 500 satellites , which is , however , much more than the number of the observationally identified satellites .",
    "that many satellites should survive , was confirmed also by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "klypin et al .",
    "note that the results of the standard cdm simulation are close to those of a @xmath0cdm simulation with the same circular velocity function of substructures .",
    "this indicates that the prediction of the presence of many satellites is a general outcome of the hierarchical scenario and not particularly dependent on the cosmological models .",
    "compared with the observational results , these cosmological models yield a large number of the satellites , approximately a factor of  50 more than the number of satellites observed in the vicinity of the milky way .",
    "@xcite suggest that the problem of the missing satellites could be resolved ( i ) by identification of some satellites with the high - velocity clouds observed in the local group @xcite or ( ii ) by considering dark satellites that failed to gather enough gas to form stars , because of expulsion of gas the supernova - driven winds or because of gas heating by the intergalactic ionizing background .",
    "the latter possibility implies that the halos of galaxies may contain substantial substructures in form of numerous invisible dm clumps .",
    "a statistic of strong gravitational lensing is an approach to identify the dark clumps in the milky way .",
    "@xcite indeed finds evidence for the existence of the numerous satellites in the milky way .",
    "if a great amount of the dark satellites exist within the milky way s halo , their interaction with the disk might cause disk heating . in their standard cdm model",
    ", @xcite found that a large fraction of the substructures have very eccentric orbits , so that they could cause resonant heating of the disk , and even heating by impulsive shocking owing to their penetration through the disk .    on the other hand",
    ", it is known that the milky way has a quite thin disk , whose scale height is about 200 pc . from the `` thinness ''",
    "@xcite have made an energetical analysis of the disk heating owing to accretion of matter , and derived the constrain that the milky way should have accumulated no more than 10 % of the disk mass within the past 5  gyr .",
    "this estimation of the disk heating might , however , be too large because the actual interaction between the disk and satellites is more complicated .",
    "for example , a single satellite could dissolve before reaching the disk @xcite or the energy injected into the disk could excitate coherent warping motions rather than heat the disk @xcite . for the case of the interaction of the disk with many substructures in the halo ,",
    "additional detailed numerical investigations are necessary . @xcite",
    "have studied the case of the @xmath0cdm cosmological model , and found that the substructures are not efficient perturbers for heating of the disk , since the masses of the clumps are lower than those of the clumps predicted in the standard cdm model , and also because the clumps are located far away from the disk and seldom get near the disk .",
    "the disk kinematics and dynamics is a good probe not only for examining the cosmological models , but much more generally for clarifying the halo substructure that is difficult to derive from direct observations .",
    "therefore in this study we aim to investigate disk heating by dark matter ( dm ) clumps for a wide range of parameters .",
    "numerical experiments on the disk dynamics are not an easy task , especially when studying the vertical structure , because of the wide range of the dynamical scales among the different components in galaxies .",
    "the smallest scale is disk , with a scale height about 200  pc , while the largest scale is the dark halo extent of @xmath1 kpc .",
    "many numerical studies consider disks of 700  pc ( @xmath2 the disk scale length ) in thickness @xcite . the question is whether the heating rate obtained for such thick disks is the same as for thin disks like the real galactic disk .    in this study",
    "we construct our initial galactic models following @xcite , which is nearly in exact equilibrium and which allows us to set up disks as thin as the real galactic disk .",
    "several additional observational constraints are taking into account to build the galactic models .",
    "we study three physical effects that could affect disk heating ; first the mass spectrum of the dm clumps , second the initial thickness of the galactic disks , and the third the spatial distribution of the clumps .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we present the galaxy model which provides a very stable thin disk comparable to the real milky way disk . a model of a clumpy dark matter halo",
    "is presented in section  3 .",
    "numerical simulations of the interaction between disk and the clumps are specified in section  4 .",
    "section  5 presents the results of our numerical simulations on the disk heating by examining the effects on the mass spectrum of the clumps , the initial disk thickness , and the spatial distribution of the clumps .",
    "we summarize and discuss our results in section  6 .",
    "we use the self - consistent disk - bulge - halo galaxy model given by kuijken and dubinski ( 1995 , hereafter kd ) .",
    "this model provides nearly exact solutions of the collisionless boltzmann and the poisson equations , so that one can control subtle differences in the initial conditions .",
    "this is important especially to set up very thin equilibrium disks , which is the most difficult part . using this model we could successfully realize an equilibrium disk with realistic thickness of only 200  pc .",
    "here we summarize the model properties briefly .",

    "the disk distribution function must depend on three integrals of motion so that it can sustain a triaxial velocity ellipsoid within the disk .",
    "since the third integral is not analytic , kd employ an approximate form of the distribution function which depends on @xmath3 , @xmath4 and the vertical energy @xmath22 .",

    "we also examined thicker disks with @xmath54  pc and 1050  pc , as described in the next section .",

    "[ eq : halodf ] , which means that the halo is nearly spherical , except for the flatness caused by the presence of the disk potential . as for the extent of the halo , we consider two different models .",
    "one has the virial radius at 262  kpc , with a dark matter mass of @xmath55 .",
    "we refer to it as the _ standard halo model_. the other has the virial radius at 1.35  mpc , with a mass of @xmath56 , which is called the _ extended halo model_. the difference between the two models lies only in the outer part of the halos .",
    "the inner density profiles ( @xmath57  kpc ) are about the same ( fig .",
    "[ fig : modelf_dens ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : modelf+_dens ] ) , thus the rotation curves of the bulge , disk , and the halo are nearly equivalent between two models ( fig .  [ fig : modelf_circ ] and fig .",

    "the extended halo model is introduced only to produce different clump distributions as described below .",
    "the halo and the bulge are treated as an external force , while the distribution of the disk is realized by self - consistent particles .    without the substructure clumps in the halo ,",
    "this model is fairly stable .",
    "the net increase in the disk thickness is only due to 2-body relaxation among the disk particles , which is only @xmath58  pc after 4.76 gyr .",
    "the numerical cosmological simulations @xcite have demonstrated the presence of the dark matter clumps within dark halos .",
    "we distribute the clumps in a similar way as shown in the numerical results .",
    "the dark matter clumps are represented by rigid bodies with a navarro , frenk & white s density profile @xcite .",
    "it provides an accurate fit to the density profiles of cdm halos : @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the critical density for closure of the universe , and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the characteristic density and the scale radius of the clump . in practice , it is more convenient to use mass and concentration to characterize each clump instead of @xmath63 and @xmath62 .",
    "the mass of a dark matter clump , @xmath64 , is related to its virial radius @xmath65 , which is defined as the radius within which the average density equals 200 times the critical density at the present @xmath66 , by the relation @xmath67 then the characteristic density @xmath61 is expressed in terms of the concentration @xmath68 as @xmath69    each clump has two characteristic parameters , but we fix the concentration to a typical value @xmath70 . since the interaction between the clumps and the disk is dominated by distant encounters , the adopted value for the concentration does not affect the heating process so much .",
    "the simulations of @xcite and @xcite show that the total mass of the clumps is about one tenth of the halo mass .",
    "we therefore give the clumps 10 % of the halo mass of the standard model , which is @xmath71 in total .",
    "the distribution of positions and velocities of the clumps is assumed to be the same as the halo distribution function ( eq.[eq : halodf ] ) , so that the clump distribution does not change in time .",
    "this is the most reasonable assumption which is important in order to maintain an equilibrium in the whole system .",
    "otherwise the change in the mean potential of the halo might cause undesired change in the disk thickness .",

    "these three models were designed in order to examine the role of the individual mass of the clumps on the disk heating .",
    "two additional physical effects on disk heating are studied .",
    "one is the initial disk thickness .",
    "thinner disks have smaller vertical velocity dispersions , they should therefore be more sensitive to disturbances from the clumps , and might experience a large thickening . therefore we ran _",

    "both models have the same mass spectrum as model  2 .",
    "another influential property of the clumps on disk heating is the position of their pericenter , where the gravitational tides become the largest .",

    "this is similar to the clump distribution obtained by @xcite in the standard cdm cosmology .    in order to examine the effect of the position distribution of the clumps",

    "we distribute the clumps in the same way as the halo particles .",
    "thus their spatial distribution is also 5 times larger in radius than in the other models . in this model",

    ", the disk is stratified in concentric annuli , each of which containing 8192 particles .",
    "the disk thickness is evaluated simply by the mean square deviation of the @xmath82-coordinate of disk particles from the center of the disk plane , @xmath83 , within the annuli .    even without the clumps , the self - heating within the disk owing to two - body relaxation among the disk particles is always taking place in numerical simulations with modest number of particles . in our simulations with 131,072 particles in the disk , the increase owing to the self - heating is typically @xmath84  pc , and @xmath85  km",

    "it is clear that the interaction of a galactic disk with a few , but massive clumps ( model  3 ) is more effective to heat the disk than the interaction with many but less massive clumps .",
    "this result can be explained by the estimate in an impulsive approximation , which predicts that the increase in the energy of the disk is @xmath88 .",
    "if there is a mass spectrum , @xmath89 , @xmath90 is dominated by massive clumps .",
    "the disk thickening obtained from model  2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : z1_z3]*b * ) is , in fact , much closer to that in model 3 .",
    "this result could be also understood by the impulsive approximation , as the energy input to the disk from the logarithmic interval in the mass spectrum is dominated by the more massive clumps ; @xmath91 .",
    "therefore the higher limit of the mass spectrum has an essential contribution on the disk heating .",
    "a difference feature between models 2 and 3 is their dependence of the disk heating on the disk radius .",
    "for all models the outer part of the disk is heated up more than the inner part , but this gradient is the largest in the model 2 .",
    "the increase of the disk thickness for @xmath92  kpc is smaller in model 2 than in model 3 , while it is opposite in the outer disk . in model 2 , which imitates the results of the standard cdm model ,",
    "the disk thickness becomes 1  kpc at the solar radius after 4.76  gyr interactions .",
    "an alternative way to estimate the disk heating is the increase in the velocity dispersion .",
    "[ fig : rvrz1_3 ] shows the same results as fig .",
    "[ fig : z1_z3 ] .",
    "the existence of a few massive clumps has a large influence on the disk heating .",

    "the interaction of the disk with clumps in model 2 produces @xmath93 km / s and @xmath94 km / s .",
    "the properties of disk heating in model 2 seem to agree with those of the thick disk component at the solar radius which has @xmath95 km / s and @xmath96 km / s and a vertical scale length of 1  kpc @xcite .",
    "it is noticeable that the initial velocity dispersion is not isotropic or @xmath97 is larger compared to @xmath98 . after 4.76 gyr ,",
    "in the inner part of the disk ( @xmath99  kpc ) , there is no increase in the radial velocity dispersion while the vertical velocity dispersion increases a lot .",
    "this anisotropy in the heating is seen also in the outer part of the disk in model 2 .",
    "a possible explanation is that the heating owing to the clumps is aiming at a more isotropic velocity dispersion .",
    "our model 2 has an initial disk thickness comparable to the observed value in the milky way , which is about 250 pc . in many simulations in other works , however , the typical initial disk thickness was chosen much larger .",

    "the susceptibility of the disks to the heating owing to the interaction with the dm clumps should depend on the initial disk thickness .",
    "thicker disks are possibly less sensitive and suffer less heating . in order to clarify the difference in the disk heating according to the initial disk thickness , we carried out three investigations with the models 2 , 4 , and 5 .",

    "a common characteristic to all radii is that the difference in the initial disk thickness decreases in time .",

    "we have made a series of numerical simulations , examining heating of galactic disks that are embedded in a halo with many small dm clumps , as suggested by cosmological simulations .",
    "we have built up the initial galaxy model as precisely in equilibrium as possible , so that we could simulate a stable disk that is as thin as the milky way .",
    "we have shown that with the mass spectrum @xmath104 , that is consistent with cosmological simulations , the massive end of the mass spectrum determines the amount of disk heating .",
    "the number of the clumps at the massive end could be only a few , so that the massive limit of the spectrum might fluctuate among galactic halos .",
    "this fact suggests a variety of disk thickness because of the random fluctuation in the number of the most massive clumps .    as a second result ,",
    "the simulations demonstrate that thicker disks suffer less heating .",
    "it is possible that a disk with 700  pc thickness shows no significant heating whereas another disk with 200  pc thickness suffers significant heating in the same circumstances .",
    "this also means that there is a critical thickness at which the heating owing to the interaction with the clumps is saturated .",
    "finally , we have considered the relation to cosmology .",
    "our model 2 mimics the clump distribution found in the standard cdm cosmology @xcite .",
    "the disk heating by the clumps has already been discussed by @xcite .",
    "they argued by a simple impulsive approximation that disk heating would be too high to explain the age - temperature relation for disk stars @xcite .",
    "our numerical simulations are supplementary to their analysis , and we confirm that the heating is significantly high .",
    "the thickness of 1  kpc at the solar radii is comparable to the present thick disk , but this heating takes place within 5  gyr and even a young thin disk would have no chance to survive . on the other hand , our model 6 corresponds to the clump distribution of the @xmath0cdm cosmology , similar to the one @xcite have studied , but more closely representing the milky way .",
    "as found by @xcite , this clump distribution causes no significant heating of the disk .",

    "<S> motivated by the presence of numerous dark matter clumps in the milky way s halo as expected from the cold dark matter cosmological model , we conduct numerical simulations to examine the heating of the disk . we construct an initial galaxy model in equilibrium , with a stable thin disk . </S>",
    "<S> the disk interacts with dark matter clumps for about 5 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> three physical effects are examined : first the mass spectrum of the dark matter clumps , second the initial thickness of the galactic disk , and third the spatial distribution of the clumps . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the massive end of the mass spectrum determines the amount of disk heating . </S>",
    "<S> thicker disks suffer less heating . </S>",
    "<S> there is a certain thickness at which the heating owing to the interaction with the clumps becomes saturates . </S>",
