    "there is considerable circumstantial evidence that strong interactions can provide the means to feed material into a galaxy nucleus to fuel activity in luminous qsos ( see , e.g. , stockton 1990 ; hutchings & neff 1992 ) .",
    "such evidence includes tidal tails and bridge - like asymmetries in qso host galaxies , extended emission around qsos , and close companion galaxies .",
    "stockton ( 1982 ) proposed that some qso companions might be tidally - stripped cores from galaxies that had interacted with the qso host galaxies .",
    "interest in qso companions has been reawakened recently by the hst results from a nearby luminous qso sample .",
    "( 1997 ) found at least one such companion lying within 25 kpc for 13 of the 20 qsos in their sample .",
    "this result underlines the importance of companion galaxies as potential triggerers of the qso activity .",
    "however , imaging observations alone can not distinguish true companions from projections of other objects , so it is important to make spectroscopic observations as well . with precise redshift measurements we can calculate the relative velocities between the qso and its companion(s ) and",
    "determine whether the latter are likely to be in gravitationally bound orbits .",
    "the relatively slow passages one obtains in bound systems appear to be important in bringing fresh material deeply into the center of galaxies .",
    "stockton ( 1982 ) measured redshifts from spectra of close companions to markarian205 , 3cr323.1 , and pks2135@xmath1147 and found all to have redshifts very close to those of the respective qsos .",
    "he argued that all three were probably tidally - limited companion galaxies .",
    "however , the redshifts of the latter two objects were determined from emission lines alone .",
    "later , stockton & mackenty ( 1987 ) found that the emission lines seen in their spectra come from the general extended emission around the qso and not specifically from the supposed companion , so the redshifts for these two objects are no longer valid .",
    "the main objective of this study was therefore to obtain better quality spectra and measure accurate redshifts for qso companions from stellar absorption lines .",
    "we remeasured the redshifts of the objects near 3cr323.1 and pks2135@xmath1147 .",
    "in addition , we measured for the first time the redshift of an object recently found near another qso , pg1700 + 518 .",
    "3cr323.1 was observed on 1991 july 19 using an image slicer in the faint object spectrograph with a tektronix 1024@xmath51024 ccd on the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope on mauna kea .",
    "the spectra were centered at 5500  and had a resolution of 2.17 pixel@xmath6 .",
    "the three image slicer slits were oriented perpendicularly to the line joining the companion to the qso , with the companion falling on the central slit .",
    "the other two slits were used to monitor the qso light .",
    "pg1700 + 518 and pks2135@xmath1147 were observed on 1996 february 15 and 1996 october 13 , respectively , with the low - resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ) on the keck i ( february ) and the keck ii ( october ) telescopes .",
    "we used a 600 groove mm@xmath6 grating blazed at 5000  to obtain a dispersion of 1.24pixel@xmath6 and a useful wavelength range of 44006900  for pg1700 + 518 and 42006700   for pks2135@xmath1147 .",
    "the slit ( 1  wide , projecting to @xmath75 pixels on the tektronix 2048@xmath52048 ccd ) was oriented in both cases along the line joining the companion and the qso .",
    "the total exposure times were 60 minutes for 3cr323.1 and 40 minutes each for pks2135@xmath1147 and pg1700 + 518 .",
    "the spectra were reduced with iraf , using standard reduction procedures .",
    "scattered qso light sometimes contaminated the companion spectra , and it had to be subtracted before any companion spectral features were visible . for 3cr323.1 , no subtraction was necessary . for pg1700 + 518 and pks2135@xmath1147 , the contamination amounted to 56% and 38% , respectively , at rest - frame 4500  .",
    "the scattered light was removed by reversing the qso continuum profile about its center and subtracting it from the companion spectrum .",
    "the fields of the three qsos are shown in figs .  1 and 2 ( plates 00 and 00 ) , on which objects of interest are labelled and the slit positions indicated .",
    "table 1 summarizes the observed properties of the three objects .",
    "columns 2 and 3 give the redshift of the qso and the companion respectively , both of them obtained from our data . in columns 4 and 5",
    "we list the projected separations between the qsos and their close companions in arcseconds and kiloparsecs , respectively . in column 6",
    "we list the velocity of the companion in the rest frame of the qso .",
    "figure 3 shows the spectrum of the companion ( @xmath8 in the upper panel of fig .  1 ) and the qso in their rest frame . while [ ] and [ ] emission lines from the extended ionized region contaminate the spectrum of the companion , absorption features are clearly present , including the h and k lines , the g - band , and the cn feature near 3830  .",
    "the redshift obtained from the absorption features is @xmath9 , which gives a velocity of @xmath10 km s@xmath6 in the qso reference frame defined by the narrow emission lines .",
    "given the uncertainty in both the velocity measurements and in the true systemic velocity of the qso host galaxy , there is a good possibility that the object is bound to the qso , especially if the qso host has a fairly high mass .",
    "superposed on the spectrum of the companion in fig .",
    "3 is a bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) model for a 2.3 gyr - old instantaneous burst stellar population with solar metallicity .",
    "the discrepancy in the fit is mainly due to the lower resolution in the model , particularly evident around the features .",
    "the intermediate - age population we find dominating the optical spectrum could be consistent with an aged starburst from the time of a previous interaction between the companion and the qso host galaxy , but better spectra over a wider wavelength range and consideration of more complex models would be necessary to make such a scenario compelling .",
    "the object 2  southeast of pks2135@xmath1147 ( @xmath8 in the lower panel of fig .",
    "1 ) was first noticed by kristian ( 1973 ) .",
    "stockton ( 1982 ) found that this object had a stellar or nearly stellar profile .",
    "he identified it as a compact companion associated with the qso by measuring its redshift from emission lines .",
    "as noted previously , this redshift is invalid since the emission comes from an extended region surrounding the qso , not from the companion ( stockton & mackenty 1987 ) .",
    "later , hickson & hutchings ( 1987 ) found weak evidence for the mgi@xmath3 absorption feature at the redshift of the qso in the spectrum of the companion , and hutchings & neff ( 1992 ) thought that the object appeared extended along the radial direction towards the qso .    on wfpc2 images of pks2135@xmath1147 from the hst archive",
    ", the object has a completely stellar profile ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this lack of extension made us suspect that the object was actually a close projection of a galactic star .",
    "the high signal - to - noise lris spectrum in the top panel of fig .",
    "4 confirms this suspicion . superposed on the spectrum of the object",
    "is the spectrum of a g5 star , which matches closely the flux distribution and absorption features of the supposed companion .    in fig .",
    "4 we also show the spectrum of galaxy @xmath3 , 5  to the southeast of the qso , and having a radial velocity with respect to the qso of @xmath11 km s@xmath6 .",
    "this galaxy and galaxy @xmath12 were among those previously identified as associated galaxies ( stockton 1978 ) . a much fainter galaxy on our slit 15  to the northwest of the qso ( @xmath13 in figs .",
    "1 and 4 ) has a relative velocity of @xmath14 km s@xmath6 .",
    "finally , we observe a strong emission region ( marked by arrows and labelled `` em '' in fig .",
    "1 ) beyond companion galaxy @xmath3 , @xmath7 12  southeast of the qso ; its velocity with respect to the qso is @xmath15 km s@xmath6 .      pg1700 + 518 is one of the brightest low - redshift qsos , one of the few low - redshift broad - absorption - line ( bal ) qsos , and a luminous ir object .",
    "a peculiar characteristic of this object is an arc - like structure @xmath7 2north of the qso ( hutchings _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; stickel _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; stockton _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; see fig .  2 ) .",
    "it is not clear from the imaging data whether this object is a distorted companion or a tidal feature from the host galaxy , though we will generally refer to it as a `` companion '' for convenience .",
    "both we and stickel _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) find evidence for a fairly symmetric main component to the host galaxy , aligned approximately e  w ( see fig .  2 )",
    ".    figure 5 shows the spectrum of the companion as well as that of the qso .",
    "we measure a redshift @xmath16 for the companion and @xmath17 for the qso , giving a relative velocity of @xmath18 km s@xmath6 in the reference frame of the qso . the strong [ ] and [ ] lines in the spectrum come from the extended ionized gas around the qso and not specifically from the companion .",
    "the apparent absorption features marked with an asterisk are a result of an over - subtraction of the qso emission .",
    "the lines seem to be spatially variable in pg1700 + 518 ( hickson & hutchings 1987 ) , leading to an uncertainty in their subtraction when we correct for the qso scattered light contribution .",
    "the companion shows a classic `` e+a '' spectrum .",
    "the presence of strong balmer absorption lines is indicative of a relatively young stellar population , whereas the mgi@xmath3 feature and the 4000  break suggest an older population .",
    "we used the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) isochrone synthesis models , with solar metallicity and a scalo ( 1986 ) imf , to model the two suggested components of the companion spectrum .",
    "the ages of the two isochrone stellar populations , determined from a @xmath19 fit to the data , are 0.09 ( + 0.04,@xmath10.03 ) gyrs and 12.25 gyrs , respectively .",
    "the younger population contributes 68% of the total light at 4500   ( rest frame ) and comprises @xmath20% of the total luminous mass .",
    "we caution that we are making a very simple approximation in assuming instantaneous bursts and using only two discrete stellar populations .",
    "accordingly , our best - fit model comprising these two populations can not be claimed to be unique , but , as shown by the lighter curve superposed on our observed spectrum in fig .  5 , it does fit the data reasonably well .",
    "e+a galaxies are characterized by strong balmer absorption , fairly blue continuum , and weak [ ] emission .",
    "at least some e+a galaxies seem to result from mergers ( lavery et al .",
    "1992 , oegerle et al .",
    "1991 ) , and liu & kennicutt ( 1995 ) find a large fraction of e+a - like galaxies in their sample of nearby merging galaxies . together with the unusual morphology of the companion , this spectrum gives us fairly strong evidence for an interaction that triggered both the qso activity and an extensive starburst .",
    "while determining spectral ages for stellar populations produced in a starburst may be the most direct approach to placing qso hosts in an age sequence , correlations among other observable parameters may ultimately give insights into the nature of their evolution .    the spectrum of pg1700 + 518 ( fig .",
    "5 ) shows unusually strong emission lines for a qso .",
    "although the emission in agns has been extensively studied ( joly 1991 and references therein ) , its precise nature is still poorly understood . however , from optical spectral characteristics and relative positions on the far - ir @xmath21 ,   \\alpha[100 , 60]$ ] diagram , lpari ( 1994 ) suggests an evolutionary sequence connecting the strength of the emission with the time elapsed since a major starburst .",
    "this scenario fits well with the proposal of sanders et al .",
    "1988 , who have suggested an evolutionary connection between ultraluminous iras galaxies ( virtually all of which are interacting or merging systems ) and the classical qso population .",
    "extreme objects like mrk231 ( hutchings & neff 1987 ; lpari et al .",
    "1994 ) , close to the blackbody region in the fir color  color plot , are believed to be in the last stages of merger and in the midst of a major starburst .",
    "their narrow - line regions ( nlr ) are weak or nonexistent because the heavy obscuration of the qso nucleus by dust strongly attenuates its uv continuum .",
    "objects like iras 07598 + 6508 have slightly less extreme emission and a position in the fir color  color diagram intermediate between the black - body and the power - law regions ; they are presumed to be right at the end of the starburst stage . finally , strong ( but not extreme ) emitters like pg1700 + 518 , which are still closer to the power law region of the two - color plot , but which also still have very weak nlr , are in the early post - starburst stage .",
    "the theoretical underpinning of this model is the supposition that the strong emission arises principally in a superwind generated by the starburst ( terlevich et al .",
    "this assumption is supported by our confirmation of the spatial variability of the emission in pg1700 + 518 ( hickson & hutchings 1987 ) .",
    "such an evolutionary sequence is at least qualitatively consistent with another correlation pointed out by stockton & ridgway ( 1991 ) , who noticed that the three low - redshift qsos that fall near the region of the fir two - color plot occupied by luminous fir galaxies ( mrk231 , mrk1014 , and 3cr48 ) are also the three qsos that show the most unambiguous evidence for tidal tails .    whether the arc - like object associated with pg1700 + 518 is actually a tidal tail associated with either the host galaxy or a companion is still uncertain , but the age we estimate since the end of the most recent starburst in this feature is consistent with the evolutionary scenarios mentioned above . if a close interaction induced a starburst in the host galaxy as well as in the companion 9@xmath510@xmath22 years ago , one might well expect the system now to be a post - starburst object with strong emission .",
    "thus for at least some classes of young qsos , we have a number of potential indicators for defining an evolutionary sequence connecting ultraluminous ir galaxies with classical qso population .",
    "the strength of the emission may plausibly be related to the numbers of type ii supernovae produced in a starburst ( terlevich et al .",
    "the position in the fir two - color plot indicates the relative balance of thermal emission from warm dust associated with a starburst and nonthermal emission from an agn nucleus .",
    "the morphology of the qso host galaxy and the distribution and morphologies of very close companions may give clues to the interaction history of the immediate environment of the qso nucleus .",
    "finally , the age of the youngest host galaxy or companion galaxy stellar population may well pinpoint the time since the event that triggered the qso activity .",
    "working out the relationships among these various parameters will be a difficult task , but one that will almost certainly clarify the relationships between ir galaxies and qsos ."
