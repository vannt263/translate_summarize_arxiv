    "the baryon density of the universe , @xmath16 , is a fundamental quantity in cosmology , and identifying the location and physical state of the baryons is a focus of significant work ( see prochaska & tumlinson 2008 for a recent review ) .",
    "a census of luminous , emitting baryons in the universe falls short of the total baryon density of the universe determined from other means .",
    "various methods of calculating the baryon density are in good agreement , including the comparison of primordial deuterium measurements with big bang nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , omeara et al .",
    "2006 , kirkman et al .",
    "2003 ) , and cosmic microwave background studies with the new wmap measurements ( e.g. , spergel et al .",
    "2006 ) . at high redshift , baryonic matter traced in emission falls short of the total baryon budget because most of the baryons reside and can be found within the cool , photoionized intergalactic medium ( igm ) of the ly@xmath17  forest ( laf ; e.g. , rauch et al . 1997 ) . at lower redshift , @xmath18 , the census of stars and gas in galaxies , galaxies and gas in clusters , etc",
    ". still falls short of @xmath16 , as emphasized by a number of researchers ( persic & salucci 1992 ; fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ) .",
    "this baryon deficit persists even if the cool , photoionized laf is included .",
    "the emitting components contribute only @xmath19 ( prochaska & tumlinson 2008 ) , while including the laf may increase this to @xmath20 ( e.g. , danforth & shull 2008 , lehner et al . 2007 , penton , stocke , & shull 2004 ) , though with significant uncertainty .",
    "thus , the easy to identify baryonic constituents of the low - redshift universe represent @xmath21 of the total baryon budget .",
    "fukugita et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggested that hot gas in the halos of galaxies and in groups of galaxies might help solve this `` missing baryons problem . ''",
    "an additional component of the baryon budget was suggested by numerical cosmological simulations , in which @xmath16 is an initial condition .",
    "such efforts ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 1999 , dav  et al . 2001 ) pointed out that the mass scale of structures in the universe grows with time , and gas falling into these structures at low redshift might then be heated to quite high temperatures .",
    "these works suggested that a significant fraction of the low - redshift baryons might then be found in a `` warm - hot intergalactic medium '' ( whim ) at tempertures @xmath22 k and densities peaked at @xmath23 times the mean density ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 2006 ) .",
    "a comparison of a range of models suggests the whim is a robust prediction of modern simulations , which predict @xmath24 of the low - redshift baryons might be found in this phase of the igm ( cen & ostriker 2006 , davet al .",
    "more recent numerical and analytical works have supported this general conclusion while exploring the effects of feedback ( e.g. , from galactic winds ) , non - equilibrium ionization , and cooling on these predictions and their connection to observables ( e.g. , oppenheimer & dav  2009 , cen & ostriker 2006 , cen & fang 2006 , kang et al . 2005 , furlanetto et al .",
    "2005 , fang & bryan 2001 , phillips et al .",
    "2001 , cen et al .",
    "2001 ) .    given the low densities and high temperatures predicted for the whim , the gas in this phase is difficult to detect in emission or absorption .",
    "one approach to studying the baryon content of the whim is to identify broad ly@xmath17  absorption in the low-@xmath25  igm .",
    "tripp et al . ( 2001 ) , richter et al . ( 2004 ) , sembach et al . ( 2004 ) , and lehner et al . ( 2007 ) report on the detection of broad ly@xmath17  absorbers ( blas ) having @xmath26 km  s@xmath27 , which corresponds to @xmath28 k if thermal broadening predominates .",
    "lehner et al . ( 2007 ) conclude the fraction of laf clouds categorized as blas is higher at low-@xmath25  than at larger redshifts ( from the sample of kirkman & tytler 1997 ) , consistent with predictions of cosmological simulations if thermal motions dominate the broadening ( see dav  et al .",
    "some of the blas may be blends of narrow lines ( or even small ripples in the observed qso continuum ) , a contamination that is difficult to assess with the generally low signal - to - noise data available with stis observations . in one case ,",
    "richter et al . ( 2004 ) find o@xmath0vi  absorption associated with a bla for which the ratio of o@xmath0vi  to h@xmath0i  @xmath29-values is consistent with pure thermal broadening , strongly suggesting an origin within hot gas at @xmath30 k and supporting the idea that some blas are thermally broadened .",
    "similarly , tripp et al .",
    "( 2001 ) identified a blended , broad ly@xmath17  line with associated o@xmath0viabsorption ; a joint analysis assuming the h@xmath0i  and o@xmath0vi  arise from the same gas yields @xmath31 k.    in addition to broad h@xmath0i  absorption , absorption lines from highly - ionized metals may be useful for probing whim gas at @xmath32 k in filaments or groups ( e.g. , verner et al . 1994b , mulchaey et al . 1996 , cen & ostriker 1999 ) .",
    "the highly ionized stages of oxygen , the most abundant metal , are the best studied , including o@xmath0vi , o@xmath0vii , and o@xmath0viii .",
    "o@xmath0vii  and o@xmath0viii  have transitions accessible to x - ray instruments , as does o@xmath0vi .",
    "searches for such absorbers have been hampered by the relatively poor resolution of modern x - ray instruments and the small number of sources observable at high enough signal to noise by the _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observatories ( see recent summaries by bregman 2007 and richter et al .",
    "while a number of measurements have been presented in the literature ( e.g. , nicastro et al . 2005 ) , some results are questioned by other analyses ( rasmussen et al .",
    "2007 , kaastra et al . 2006 ) while a few may be on firmer ground ( e.g. , fang et al . 2007 ) .",
    "it is thus far difficult to judge the fidelity of the x - ray measurements .    given the high resolution and sensitivity of the currently - available ultraviolet spectrographs , searches for absorption due to the o@xmath0vi@xmath33   doublet may represent the most efficient means of probing the whim , even though o@xmath0vi  is not the dominant ionization state of oxygen for the temperature at which the majority of the whim is thought to exist ( @xmath34 k ; dav  et al .",
    "the first blind search for low - redshift o@xmath0vi  absorbers ( mostly over @xmath35 ) of burles & tytler ( 1996 ) was only sensitive to very strong absorbers but nonetheless demonstrated that these absorbers could trace a significant component of the baryonic mass in the universe .",
    "tripp and collaborators first identified a number of o@xmath0vi  absorption line systems at very low redshift ( @xmath36 ) with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) and the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) ; though their statistical sample was small , these observations suggested a large number density of o@xmath0vi  absorbers at low-@xmath25  ( tripp , savage , & jenkins 2000 ; tripp & savage 2000 ) .",
    "recent surveys of o@xmath0vi  absorption at low redshift using a complete sample of stis observations continue to find a very large population of absorbers ( tripp et al .",
    "2008 , thom & chen 2008a , danforth & shull 2008 ) .",
    "the number density of intervening o@xmath0vi  absorbers per unit redshift is @xmath37 for equivalent widths @xmath38 m , perhaps increasing to @xmath39 for @xmath40 m  ( danforth & shull 2008 ) . for comparison , recent estimates for the number density of h@xmath0i  absorbers at @xmath41 give @xmath42 for @xmath43 m  ( lehner et al .",
    "2007 ) and @xmath44 for @xmath45 m  ( danforth & shull 2008 ) .",
    "the large number of absorbers by itself suggests that the gas probed by these o@xmath0vi  transitions could indeed be an important reservoir of baryons , although accurate estimates of the ionization state and metallicity of these absorbers are required for a quantitative measure of the total mass density",
    ".    however , it is possible or even likely that a significant fraction of o@xmath0vi  absorbers do not trace the whim , but rather probe metal - enriched , photoionized igm material .",
    "this point has been emphasized in a number of analyses of individual absorbers and sight lines ( savage et al .",
    "2002 , prochaska et al .",

    "thom & chen 2008b ) .",
    "oppenheimer & dav  ( 2009 ) have recently presented cosmological simulations in which o@xmath0viabsorbers predominantly trace gas at temperatures @xmath46 , well below the majority of the gas associated with the whim .",
    "a significant amount of the most commonly - used probe of whim gas , o@xmath0vi , may therefore arise in photoionized gas , although kang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and oppenheimer & dav  ( 2009 ) have argued that some of the photoionized o@xmath0vi  may be whim gas that has cooled to low temperatures .",
    "it remains to be seen , however , if the relatively extreme predictions of oppenheimer & dav  ( 2009 ) will be verified by other simulations .",
    "undoubtedly some o@xmath0vi  systems are associated with photoionized gas , though whether they outnumber or dominate the whim absorbers is a question open to debate ( e.g. , danforth 2009 ) .",
    "even if photoionized absorbers represent a significant fraction of the total , most simulations suggest that the highest equivalent width o@xmath0vi  systems are most likely to be collisionally ionized , either tracing whim gas or gas associated with the hot halos of galaxies ( cen et al .",
    "2001 , fang & bryan 2001 , ganguly et al .",
    "2008 , oppenheimer & dav  2009 ) .",
    "while o@xmath0vi  may not be a perfect tracer of the whim , and x - ray measurements are not yet secure , observations of euv transitions that are redshifted into the bands of _ fuse _  and _ hst _  provide other evidence for shock - heated hot gas in the low-@xmath25  igm . in particular , the doublets of ne@xmath0viii  @xmath47770.409 , 780.324 , mg@xmath0x@xmath47609.790 , 624.950 , and si@xmath0xii  @xmath47499.406 , 520.665 are potentially useful probes of hot gas in redshifted igm ( e.g. , verner , tytler , & barthel 1994bx  624.950   and si@xmath0xii 520.665   transitions that are not in agreement with the wavelengths given in verner , barthel , & tytler 1994a .",

    "they probe temperatures in the same range as x - ray absorption lines , but at better sensitivity to a given h column density given the maturity of the uv instruments with which they can be detected .",
    "savage et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have reported on a detection of intervening ne@xmath0viii  at @xmath50 that they show comes from hot gas .",

    "the ratio of integrated column densities in this absorber is @xmath51 , which is consistent with gas in colllisional ionization equilibrium near @xmath52 k. searches for ne@xmath0viii  absorption associated with 10 other o@xmath0vi  absorbers have thus far yielded no further detections ( prochaska et al .",

    "the difference between the two members of the doublet could be due to contamination of _ both _",
    "profiles by intervening ly@xmath17  absorption with peak optical depths that yield consistant @xmath94  integrations if one assumes they are o@xmath0vi .",
    "limits on ly@xmath87 absorption at the appropriate redshifts do not rule this out .",
    "alternatively , as noted by tripp et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , this misalignment could be due to small scale errors in the stis geometric distortion correction , as have been identified , e.g. , by jenkins & tripp ( 2001 ) .",
    "such difficulties are neither well characterized for stis nor common .    while `` hot pixels '' can create discrepancies like those seen here ( see discussion in tripp et al .",
    "2008 ) , the observations of pks  0405123  were taken in two visits with the echelle orders displaced signficantly between the visits .",
    "the data extracted for the two visits individually are consistent over these wavelength regions , which would not be the case for hot pixels fixed on the detector .",
    "thus , this explanation is not tenable .",
    "we have attempted to simultaneously fit the profiles of the o@xmath0vidoublet as observed by stis . aside from the velocity range of possible contamination , the @xmath94  profiles of the 1031 and 1037 transitions seen in figure [ fig : ovi ] are in good agreement , implying the effects of unresolved saturation can not be large ( as also evidenced by the agreement in integrated apparent columns , see table [ tab : totalcolumns ] ) .",
    "the fitting was undertaken to attempt to disentangle the component structure of the absorption and to provide a measure of the column density of the higher velocity components , especially component 3 ( @xmath113 km  s@xmath27 ) , which is strongly blended with the contaminated or compromised regions .",
    "we attempted fits under two assumptions : 1 ) the discrepant regions in the o@xmath0vi  lines are contaminated by interloping absorbers ; and 2 ) the discrepant regions suffer from difficulties in the wavelength assignment , but represent o@xmath0viabsorption associated with this absorber .",
    "in the first of these fits , we artificially increased the variance over the velocity ranges @xmath114 km  s@xmath27  and @xmath115 km  s@xmath27  for the 1031 and 1037   transitions , respectively , to such large values that they do not affect the calculation of @xmath107 and , hence , the parameters of the fit .",
    "the fits to the regions encompassed by components 1 and 2 are non - unique , and can be fit with one , two , or three components with similar values of @xmath107 .",
    "part of the difficulty in fitting these lower - velocity components is the loss of information on the positive velocity side of the profiles due to the assumed contaminating absorption . in addition , the component structure in the o@xmath0vi  profiles is not distinct .",
    "this is in contrast to the c@xmath0iii  and o@xmath0iv  profiles in this region . if the component structure is assumed to follow that of c@xmath0iii , with velocities fixed to those in table [ tab : profilefits ] , the total column density for this model is @xmath116 .",
    "the fit is shown in figure [ fig : ovicomponents ] as the thick grey line , with the central velocities of the components shown above the profiles . a fit in which velocities of the o@xmath0vi  components to be a free parameter is also shown as the thick dashed black line ( the black ticks above the profiles show the central velocities in this case ) .",
    "the total column density is @xmath117 . in this fit ,",
    "the largest column density is in component 1 ; the large fitted @xmath29-value for this component has a significant uncertainty , which is the source of the much larger error in this model than that with the velocities fixed to the c@xmath0iii  solution .",
    "both fits have indistinguishable values of @xmath107 . in each case",
    "the columns of component 3 are very nearly the same near @xmath118 ( the value if the velocity is allowed to vary ) .    the second fit , which assumes all of the absorption is o@xmath0viassociated with this system , is shown in the bottom two panels of figure [ fig : ovicomponents ] .",
    "these plots show the nature of the difficulty quite well for the positive velocity component .",
    "components 1 and 2 are virtually indistinguishable from the fits above where the velocities are allowed to vary .",
    "the total column density in the o@xmath0vifit is @xmath119 , some @xmath120 dex higher than that derived above .",
    "we somewhat favor this total column over the lower value .",
    "the total equivalent width for the full profile is @xmath121 m  ( see table [ tab : totalcolumns ] ) , which places this absorber in the top 10% of the @xmath122 intervening o@xmath0vi  absorbers studied in the recent survey of tripp et al .",
    "the column and equivalent width values in this assumption are consistent with those derived by tripp et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and thom & chen ( 2008b ) .",
    "we focus our ionization analysis on the gas associated with components 1 , 2 , and 3 , excluding the additional column over the discrepant region in o@xmath0vi  that does not appear in c@xmath0iii  and o@xmath0iv . because the discrepant component is not seen in c@xmath0iii  or o@xmath0iv , it must have significantly different ionization conditions than the rest of the gas , and we do not attempt to model it . because most of our models will assume a solar c / o ratio , metallicities [ c / h ] derived from c@xmath0iiiwill also imply a given [ o / h ] .",
    "thus for our ionization and metallicity calculations ( when they depend on o@xmath0vi ) will adopt the fit fixed to the c@xmath0iii  velocities , which gives @xmath123 .",
    "this excludes a component at @xmath124 km  s@xmath27 , but includes absorption from component 3 at @xmath113 km  s@xmath27  ( top panels in figure [ fig : ovicomponents ] ) .",
    "this value is preferred over that in which the velocities of the o@xmath0viare allowed to freely float because the uncertainties become unreasonably large in the latter case in our estimation .",
    "an integration of the @xmath94  profile of o@xmath0vi  over the uncontaminated region at @xmath125 km",
    "s@xmath27  yields @xmath126 ( a mean of the two o@xmath0vi  lines ) . adding the column associated with component 3 from above , this gives a total column density of @xmath127 excluding the compromised regions ( i.e. , for components 1 to 3 ) .",
    "thus , the uncertainty derived using a model with velocities fixed to those found in c@xmath0iii  provides an uncertainty closer to the @xmath94-derived values .",
    "we note that including absorption associated with component 3 only impacts the metallicities  the ratios of o@xmath0vi / c@xmath0iii  and o@xmath0iv / c@xmath0iii  derived for components 1 and 2 are consistent with the ratio after including component 3 , which adds @xmath128 dex to these three ions .",
    "thus , had we chosen to model the clearly - uncompromised velocity range , we would derive the same results as those presented below .",
    "the @xmath94  profiles shown in figure [ fig : nav ] demonstrate that the ions c@xmath0iii , o@xmath0iv , o@xmath0v , and o@xmath0vi  in this absorber have a similar velocity structure , with gas associated with the three components discussed above ( and perhaps a fourth seen in o@xmath0vi  and o@xmath0v ) .",
    "the profile fitting results of  [ sec : componentfits ] reinforce this basic structure , though with the caveat that the limited resolution of the data could be hiding substructure within the components ( or component blends ) identified in table [ tab : profilefits ] .",
    "the h@xmath0iand metal ions would be considered `` well - aligned '' in the categorization of tripp et al .",
    "( 2008 ) since their central velocities are consistent with one another within @xmath129 . however , the uncertainties in the h@xmath0i  centroid are relatively large , so the meaning of this alignment is not clear . in addition , too little information is available for lyman - series absorption to know if the detailed component structure hinted at in the metal ions is mirrored in h@xmath0i .    while the metal line profiles in figure [ fig : nav ] are generally similar , there are hints of differences between them .",
    "the broad envelope of the o@xmath0vi  distribution ( at @xmath109 km  s@xmath27 ) is similar to the o@xmath0iv  and c@xmath0iii  distributions , and the total velocity extents of o@xmath0vi , o@xmath0iv , and c@xmath0iii  are all very similar ( including the gas in component 3 at @xmath130 km  s@xmath27 ) .",
    "however , o@xmath0vi  seems less prominent over the velocity range of component 2 compared with the lower - ionization species .",
    "this may be due to changing ionization conditions between components 1 and 2 , with a corresponding change in the ionic ratios , or due to somewhat broader components in o@xmath0vi .",
    "these differences , however , are at the limits of the noise and resolution of the current data .",
    "it is difficult to say whether or not they are significant .",
    "if so , they may imply the existence of a warmer phase of the gas traced by o@xmath0vi  and a cooler phase traced by c@xmath0iiiand o@xmath0iv .",
    "however , if this is true , _ both phases must be present at the same velocities_.    the component doppler parameters given in table [ tab : profilefits ] limit the temperature of the gas .",
    "for example , the @xmath29-values of c@xmath0iii  and o@xmath0iv  for component 2 imply maximum temperatures of @xmath131 k and @xmath132 k , respectively.iv  are uncertain as discussed above . lowering the fwhm of the assumed lsf for fuse to 18 km  s@xmath27  allows for temperatures @xmath133 k. ] the contribution of a hot component to these species must not produce absorption profiles broader than observed . to test whether a significant amount of warm - hot gas ( with @xmath134 k ) could be included in these profiles ,",
    "we have fit the c@xmath0iii  and o@xmath0iv  profiles including an additional component forced to have a @xmath29-value appropriate for gas with @xmath32 k. for c@xmath0iii , we find that any broad components added in this way must have negligible column densities in order to be consistent with the observed profiles .",
    "this is not unexpected given the small ionization fraction of c@xmath0iii  in gas with such temperatures ( see below ) .",
    "for o@xmath0iv , one can include a broader component centred near @xmath135 km  s@xmath27 . adopting a @xmath29-value of 10 km  s@xmath27",
    ", corresponding to @xmath136 k for such a component leads to very small column densities in that component or forces the existing component 2 to have unphysically - low @xmath29-values ( implying temperatures much lower than expected for the igm ) for reasonable values of @xmath107 .",
    "if one assumes @xmath137 km  s@xmath27 , corresponding to @xmath138 k , the fits are significantly better .",
    "our fits suggest at most 30% of the total column of o@xmath0iv  can come from such a component .",
    "this limit comes about because as the column of the broad component is increased above @xmath139 , the column of the existing component 2 increases as well ( due to a decreasing @xmath29-value for component 2 ) .",
    "this conclusion is robust to changes in the adopted lsf for fuse .",
    "it is mostly driven by the nature of a multicomponent curve of growth , where the @xmath29-value of the narrow component is decreased in order to account for an increased contribution to the equivalent width from the broad component .",
    "the decrease in the @xmath29-value for the narrow component increases the total column density substantially , always keeping the broad component to @xmath140 of the total .",
    "thus , given the profile comparisons and the profile fitting results , there may be room , if not some evidence , for a multiphase structure within this absorber .",
    "the discrepancies between the @xmath94  profiles of the ions that might imply a multiphase structure are subtle compared with those seen in many absorbers ( e.g. , tripp et al .",

    "2 ) if photoionization is important , what is the nature of the ionizing uvb spectrum ? and",
    "3 ) if collisions are important , what assumptions are appropriate ( e.g. , cie versus various neq scenarios ) and are the models sufficiently sophisticated ?",
    "of course , the latter concern of the level of sophistication in the models is appropriate for all processes .",
    "the @xmath85 absorber toward pks  0405123  has characteristics consistent with pure photoionization by the uvb , perhaps including contributions radiation that has leaked from galaxies ( haardt & madau 2001 ) . models of pure collisional ionization do not reproduce the observed ionic ratios in this absorber .",
    "multiphase models that include the effects of ionization via both photons and electron collisions are also broadly consistent with the observed ionic ratios in this absorber . even in these models , however , the majority of the gas is likely warm photoionized material .",
    "the choice of one or the other of the ionizing backgrounds considered here is an important one , as they give significantly different metallicities for the absorber , ranging from [ o / h]@xmath298 for the qsos+galaxies uvb to @xmath299 for the qsos only spectrum .",
    "thus , the choice of one of two reasonable uvb spectra ( and other uvb prescriptions exist ) gives metallicities discrepant by @xmath300 dex , or a factor of three .",

    "this difference can have significant consequences for understanding the enrichment of the low-@xmath25  igm and the low-@xmath25  baryon budget .",

    ". reimers et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have argued such variation is likely for @xmath304 o@xmath0vi  absorbers , and there is strong evidence for a varying uvb spectral shape from the he@xmath0ii  forest at @xmath305 ( e.g. , shull et al .",
    "2004 , kriss et al .",

    "2008 , thom & chen 2008b ) compared with their simulations .",
    "if the uvb can have significant contributions from relatively local sources , leaky low luminosity galaxies ( @xmath306 ) are mostly likely to influence the ionization of the present absorber given the lack of high luminosity galaxies with low impact parameter to the qso sight line ( prochaska et al .",
    "2006 ; see  [ sec : discussionsub1 ] ) .",
    "our data do not provide sufficient diagnostics to distinguish between the two uvb models investigated here .",

    "other studies have shown that pure photoionization can be made consistent with the ionization characteristics of a significant fraction of the low-@xmath25  o@xmath0viabsorbers .",
    "for example , tripp et al . (",
    "2008 ) showed that the o@xmath0vi / h@xmath0i  and o@xmath0vi / c@xmath0iii  column density ratio in a large sample of absorbers could be explained by simple photoionization models . in their simplest models",

    "had measurements of that ratio required a departure from the hydrostatic assumption , but their assumptions were still reasonable in the context of the igm .",
    "thus , danforth et al . ( 2006 ) conclude photoionization is unlikely on the basis of a photoionization model matching an ensemble of absorbers with a small number of ionic measurements to ionization models that use only one uvb that photoionization . meanwhile , tripp et al .",
    "( 2008 ) come to opposing conclusions , finding that photoionization may explain the conditions in an ensemble of aborbers by comparing a wide range of models using different uvb and density assumptions to an ensemble of o@xmath0vi  and c@xmath0iii  measurements .",
    "it seems very difficult , given the work on the present absorber , to rule out either photoionization or collisional ionization in such a broad range of absorbers , especially given the small number of ions typically measured and the large number of potential model assumptions .",
    "danforth & shull ( 2008 ) have presented measurements for a broader range of ions , including c@xmath0iii , c@xmath0iv , n@xmath0v , o@xmath0vi , si@xmath0iii , and si@xmath0iv , in a survey of low-@xmath25  absorbers .",
    "on the basis of an intercomparison of the various ionic ratios , these authors argue that o@xmath0vi  and n@xmath0v  are reliable tracers of the whim , while c@xmath0iv  may arise from either collisionally - ionized or photoionized material .",
    "the rest of the ions they argue are relatively good tracers of photoionized matter .",
    "we feel that detailed models of the individual absorbers are likely required to determine whether this is truly the case ( e.g. , cooksey et al .",
    "2008 ; prochaska et al .",
    "2004 ) , especially given the range of potential ionizing backgrounds and the potential for mixed ionization processes ( photoionization and collisional ionization ) .",
    "in particular , we do not find the argument that the slopes of the frequency distributions in o@xmath0vi  and c@xmath0iii  differ a strong argument for the dominance of collisionally - ionized o@xmath0vi , since a distribution of densities , ionization parameters , and local shape of the uvb may provide for much of the difference .",
    "we are not arguing that all of the o@xmath0vi  is photoionized , but rather that it may be difficult to tell even in absorbers with observations of a wide range of ions .",
    "thus , while there is strong evidence that some of the o@xmath0vi  absorbers are associated with hot , collisionally ionized gas ( e.g. , richter et al .",
    "2004 , savage et al .",
    "2005 , tripp et al .",
    "2001 ) , a significant fraction of these systems may be strongly influenced by photoionization , like the present system , which requires @xmath310100%  of the o@xmath0vito be photoionized .",
    "these populations are not exclusive given the multiphase nature of some absorbers and the possibility that some trace moderate temperature ( @xmath254 k ) photoionized gas that is mildly shock heated or that has cooled from higher temperatures ( e.g. , models discussed by oppenheimer & dav2009 , kang et al .",

    "a fair number seem to have temperatures somewhat higher than one would expect from pure photoionization , suggesting an extra source of heating that would likely impact the ionization as well .",
    "these measurements suggest a mixture of processes could be at work in some absorbers , although photoionization is likely a strong component for a large fraction of the aligned systems .",
    "it is not yet clear what the mixture is like in the multiphase absorbers so categorized due to differences in the h@xmath0i  and o@xmath0vi  profiles .",
    "prochaska et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have noted an apparent anticorrelation between the ionization parameter for the cloudy photoionization model best fitting the metal column densities and the h@xmath0i  column of an absorber , a result also seen by lehner et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in a larger number of absorbers along several sight lines .",
    "this can be understood in part if the h@xmath0i  column is a rough measure of physical density of the absorber ( e.g. , schaye 2001 ; see discussion in prochaska et al .",
    "the relationship seen in these earlier works will certainly depend on the adopted ionizing spectrum , since the two uvb spectra investigated here give significantly different ionization parameters .",
    "however , while those studies adopt a haardt & madau qsos - only spectrum , if this result is directly tied to the physical density of the absorption , the relationship should still hold if galaxies contribute to the ionization .",
    "while it has been suggested this correlation implies the absorbers in those studies are likely to be photoionized , our multiphase models show that a mixture of ionization mechanisms can not only give similar ionization parameters for the photoionized component , but in some cases a photoionization only and multiphase ionization model can not be distinguished .",
    "thus , the correlation likely does not rule out a contribution to those absorbers from collisional ionization , although it may suggest photoionization dominates the ionization , as in the absorber studied in this work .",
    "an important remaining question is how one might distinguish multiphase models such as those with results summarized in ",
    "[ sec : multiphase ] from the pure photoionization models of  [ sec : photoionization ] .",
    "while the aforementioned ionization parameter - h@xmath0i  column relationship may not discriminate between these models , there are several promising options . for the current absorber",
    ", c@xmath0iv  has significant power to discriminate between these classes of models . the ratios c@xmath0iv / c@xmath0iii  and c@xmath0iv / o@xmath0vi  are significantly different for photoionization models compared with the multiphase models due to the strong variations in these ratios as a function of temperature in the collisionally ionized gas . at low temperatures ,",
    "the c@xmath0iv / c@xmath0iii  ratio in our multiphase models is nearly the same as the qsos+galaxies uvb photoionization model .",
    "however , for temperatures @xmath311 , this ratio is @xmath312 to 15 times higher for the multiphase models than the photoionization models .",
    "conversely , the c@xmath0iv / o@xmath0vi  ratio is within a factor of two for both models at @xmath311 , while at lower temperatures the multiphase models predict a c@xmath0iv / o@xmath0vi  ratio factors of @xmath3134 to @xmath3141000 higher than the pure photoionization models ( which give @xmath315 to 0.2 for the qsos and qsos+galaxies uvb , respectively ) .",
    "this large difference in models at low temperatures is due to the strong fall off in o@xmath0vi  ionization fraction with decreasing temperature over this range .",
    "these large differences for models in which a small fraction of the gas is associated with the collisionally - ionized phase is due to the very large ( or small ) ratios of c@xmath0iv  compared with the other two ions in collisionally ionized gas .",
    "for example , at @xmath316 , the c@xmath0iv / c@xmath0iii  ratio in cie is expected to be @xmath31360 compared with @xmath3132 in the qsos+galaxies photoionization model . thus , even though the collisionally ionized phase is limited to @xmath21 of the total hydrogen at this temperature ( see figure [ fig : multiphase ] ) , it contributes @xmath317 of the c@xmath0iv .",
    "danforth & shull ( 2008 ) studied the integrated column densities of c@xmath0iii , c@xmath0iv , and o@xmath0vi  for a number of absorbers , finding c@xmath0iii / c@xmath0ivratios of @xmath318 and c@xmath0iv / o@xmath0vi  ratios consistent with @xmath319 ( both with a quite large scatter ) .",
    "both of these ratios are consistent with our photoionization models , though it may be dangerous to draw conclusions based on these two average ratios , which rely on different samples of absorbers , without attempting models of the ionization to match the full range of ionization states in each absorber .    indeed ,",
    "danforth & shull conclude that the o@xmath0vi  mostly arises in collisionally - ionized gas on the basis of their comparisons .",
    "danforth & shull note that the correlation of c@xmath0iv  with both o@xmath0vi  and c@xmath0iiiis not particularly strong , and they use this to argue that the observed c@xmath0iv  in their sample may arise from both shock - heated and photoionized gas ( traced by o@xmath0vi  and c@xmath0iii , respectively , in their argument ) .",
    "a significant population of multiphase absorbers where the mixture of phases varies could presumably also provide for such a lack of correlation .",
    "future observations with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) on board _ hst _  should provide significantly higher signal - to - noise ratio observations of qsos than have been possible with stis , albeit at lower spectral resolution .",
    "this can provide better limits and detections of weak absorption lines for some sight lines with quite low - s / n stis observations , such as the pks  0405123  sight line , allowing stronger constraints on the models . in the present absorber , for example , o@xmath0iii  already provides important constraints on the single - phase collisional ionization models .",
    "better observations of this transition will begin to limit the photoionization and multiphase models more severely .",
    "the metallicity of this absorber is quite high for both uvb spectra adopted here .",
    "there are significant systematic uncertainties associated with our estimates , but [ o / h]@xmath7 or @xmath320 are both high compared with the canonical mean of [ o / h]@xmath321 .",
    "the high metallicity and great strength of the o@xmath0vi  absorption both favor an origin of this absorber near to a galaxy , although the h@xmath0i  column and estimated densities are not large .",
    "given the discussion in the previous section , if this absorber were associated with a galaxy , it would likely be a sub-@xmath322 system .",
    "we have presented _ fuse _  and _ hst_/stis ultraviolet absorption line observations of the @xmath100 absorber toward the qso pks  0405123 .",
    "we have measured the column densities of h@xmath0i , c@xmath0iii , n@xmath0iv , o@xmath0iv , o@xmath0v , and o@xmath0vi  and placed upper limits on the column densities of another seven ions .",
    "we use these measurements to study the ionization processes at work in this absorber and estimate its metallicity .",

    "this absorber shows very strong o@xmath0vi  absorption with no detectable ne@xmath0viii  or mg@xmath0x .",
    "there is no direct evidence for a strong component of gas with temperatures @xmath231 k as expected if it traces the largest mass of missing baryons in a whim .",
    "however , the limits to the amount of material depend strongly on the temperature ( see figure [ fig : whimlimits ] ) . this system would not likely be detectable in x - ray absorption .",
    "2 .   we have modeled the broad range of ions covered by our data using a number of collisional ionization and photoionizations models .",
    "this absorber can be modelled as purely photoionized gas with [ o / h]@xmath323 if the ionizing uvb includes a significant contribution from photons associated with star forming galaxies and [ o / h]@xmath324 if the uvb does not include a significant contribution from galaxies .",
    "these metallicities are robust to the inclusion of a collisionally ionized phase .",
    "3 .   the ionization of the absorber may also be well described by multiphase models in which the photoionized gas in the absorber is complemented by a contribution from hot ( @xmath325 k ) , collisionally ionized gas .",
    "the strong o@xmath0vi  in this system may trace a photoionized phase , a collisionally - ionized phase , or a mixture of both . in this case , the metallicities are still consistent with those from a pure photoionization model .",
