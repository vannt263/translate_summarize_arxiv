    "[ conj : main ] for all integers @xmath9 and @xmath10 , there is an integer @xmath2 such that for every finite set @xmath8 of size @xmath11 in the plane @xmath12 , if each point of @xmath8 is assigned one of @xmath4 colours , then    * @xmath8 contains @xmath13 collinear points , or * @xmath8 contains a monochromatic line .",
    "the motivation for this conjecture comes from the hales - jewett theorem . by a _ combinatorial line _ in the grid @xmath14^n \\subset { \\mathbb{r}}^n$ ] ( where @xmath14 $ ] stands for the set @xmath15 ) we mean a set of the form @xmath16^n : x_i = x_j \\text { for all } i , j \\in i\\}\\ ] ] for fixed @xmath17 , i \\neq { \\emptyset}$ ] and fixed @xmath18 { \\setminus}i$ ] . now the hales - jewett theorem can be stated as follows .",
    "[ thm : hales - jewett ] for all integers @xmath19 , there is an integer @xmath2 such that whenever each of the points in @xmath14^n \\subset { \\mathbb{r}}^n$ ] is given one of @xmath4 colours , there is a monochromatic combinatorial line .",
    "conjecture [ conj : main ] is a natural geometric version of this theorem , where the lines are not necessarily parallel to a fixed set of axes , and the ambient set can be any set without many collinear points .    for @xmath20",
    "the result is trivial : we may take @xmath21 and by the pigeonhole principle there is a line containing two points of the same colour .",
    "the case @xmath22 is a special case of the motzkin - rabin theorem that was proved in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate by a counterexample that the conjecture is false in the next smallest case @xmath23 , and hence it is false whenever @xmath7 .",
    "[ thm : main ] for any @xmath1 , there is a set @xmath24 of size @xmath2 satisfying :    * no four points of @xmath8 are collinear , and * the points of @xmath8 can be coloured using three colours in such a way that no line is monochromatic .",
    "we start by noting that it is sufficient to find a set with the required properties in the projective plane @xmath25 . indeed , given a finite set @xmath26",
    ", one can choose a line @xmath27 that does not meet @xmath8 and apply a projective transformation that sends @xmath28 to the line at infinity .",
    "the image of @xmath8 under this transformation is contained in the affine plane @xmath12 while the collinearity relations of the original set @xmath8 are preserved .",
    "our counterexample is a finite subset of the irreducible cubic curve @xmath29 .",
    "more specifically , we will use a subset of the set of its non - singular points @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a point at infinity that is contained in all lines parallel to the @xmath32-axis and in the line at infinity . by the bzout theorem",
    ", @xmath33 does not contain a set of four collinear points .",
    "moreover , it is a well known fact in algebraic geometry that @xmath33 forms an abelian group with the property that distinct points @xmath34 are collinear if and only if @xmath35 , and that @xmath33 is isomorphic to the circle group @xmath36 ( see @xcite , p. 1920 ) .",
    "in fact , any choice of an elliptic curve whose group is isomorphic to @xmath37 would do .",
    "however , we choose this particular cubic curve ( which is not an elliptic curve as it contains a singular point @xmath38 ) because it admits a simple explicit group isomorphism @xmath39 , given by @xmath40 this enables us to give a self - contained proof of the theorem without referring to any results from algebraic geometry . however , the reader familiar with elliptic curves can skip the proof of the following proposition .",
    "the fact that @xmath46 is a well defined bijection follows from the basic properties of the cotangent function . to prove the equivalence of the geometric and algebraic relations",

    "similarly , if two of the numbers ( say , @xmath57 and @xmath32 ) sum to @xmath53 , then the three points are collinear if and only if @xmath59 , that is , @xmath60 .",
    "now we can assume that @xmath61 are all non - zero and that no two of them sum to @xmath53 .",
    "then the points @xmath43 and @xmath44 are collinear if and only if @xmath62 which after rearrangement becomes @xmath63 notice that @xmath64 is a solution by ( [ eq : cot ] ) , and it is unique in @xmath36 as @xmath65 is injective on @xmath66 .        for the set @xmath68 ( see fig .",
