    "expanding shock waves are naturally produced by diverse astrophysical phenomena , such as supernovae , gamma ray bursts and stellar winds .",
    "so far , analytical self similar solutions have been found for several simple cases , of which we take special interest in the case of strong spherical shocks propagating into a density profile that decays as a power of the radius @xmath3 the first solutions of this kind to be found , now commonly known as the sedov taylor von - neumann solutions @xcite , for the case @xmath4 describe decelerating shocks .",
    "the solutions are based on the conservation of energy inside the shocked region , and they are called type i solutions . if @xmath5 , where @xmath2 is the adiabatic index of the ambient gas , then the explosion is filled , i.e. the pressure is greater than zero anywhere inside the shocked region . if @xmath6 , then the explosion is hollow , i.e. the pressure ( and the density ) vanish at a finite radius @xcite . if @xmath7 , then the hydrodynamic equations admit a relatively simple solution known as the primakoff solution @xcite . if @xmath8 the energy diverges at the center , so energy conservation no longer applies and a different condition must be used @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will focus on filled type i explosions ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the solutions discussed above , while useful , falls short when describing shocks propagating into density profiles that deviate from a simple power law decay .",
    "this might occur in a variety of astrophysical scenarios .",
    "one example could be the propagation of an outward shock wave in a stratified core collapse supernova progenitor @xcite .",
    "another example might be the interaction of a supernova shock wave with a circumstellar bubble @xcite .",
    "such bubbles form around progenitors that emit strong stellar wind that pushes the circumstellar wind away , so when the shock emerges from the progenitor , it first interacts with a low density medium inside the bubble , and later with the higher density medium outside .",
    "one example that we will dwell on is the variation of the luminosity due to the interaction of a supernova shock wave with a heterogeneous interstellar material .    from the reasons mentioned above",
    ", one could understand the need to generalize as much as possible the external density profile for which we can obtain analytic solutions , and this is what we attempt here .",
    "this paper takes after a similar endeavor for type ii solutions @xcite .",
    "the idea of applying perturbation theory to the strong explosion problem is not new , but so far it focused on stability analysis . throughout the years",
    "it has stirred up many controversies , most of which regarding inner boundary conditions .",
    "the stability of type i explosions was first studied by bernstein and book @xcite , but their analysis was later refuted by gaffet @xcite .",
    "consequently , a new perturbation theory was proposed by ryu and vishniac @xcite . however , kushnir and waxman pointed out a possible error with the analysis of ryu and vishniac , and proposed yet another boundary condition to the perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite and experiments with high power lasers @xcite are in general agreement with the results of ryu and vishniac .",
    "the bone of contention in these controversies is the inner boundary conditions , i.e. the value of the hydrodynamic variables at the center .",
    "this paper will attempt to shed light on the question of the correct boundary conditions .",
    "the plan in this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we review the unperturbed solutions and the boundary conditions at the front and at the center . in sec .",
    "iii we develop the perturbation equations and boundary conditions .",
    "we then discuss the solutions to these equations and compare them to numerical results obtained from a full hydrodynamic simulation , and finally we conclude in sec . iv .",
    "we proceed to give a quick review of the unperturbed solutions under considerations @xcite .",
    "the physical scenario is the deposition of a large amount of energy from a point source at the center of a spherically symmetric distribution of cold gas .",
    "it may be noted that spherical symmetry was chosen for its relevance to most astrophysical scenarios , but planar an cylindrical geometries may readily be treated as well .",
    "the gas density follows a power law behavior ( equation [ eq : unpert_density ] ) .",
    "we begin with the euler equation for an ideal fluid with adiabatic index @xmath2 in spherical symmetry @xmath9 @xmath10    @xmath11    these equations feature the density @xmath12 , velocity @xmath13 and speed of sound @xmath14 as the dependent variables . they are usually expressed in terms of the pressure @xmath15 rather than the speed of sound , and they are related by @xmath16 we define dimensionless variables @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the shock radius",
    ". it is assumed that the shock radius has power law dependence on time @xmath23      the boundary conditions at the front are determined by the rankine hugoniot shock conditions @xcite .",
    "@xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27    the power law index @xmath28 is determined by the boundary conditions at the center . in principle",
    ", the center of an explosion can either be a source or a sink of energy . if the energy injection is power law of the time , than it is possible to obtain self similar solutions @xcite .",
    "it was shown that energy injection always creates a hollow explosion @xcite , as if the extra energy was the work exerted by an expanding spherical piston .",
    "the condition that the energy is conserved is therefore equivalent to the condition that the velocity vanishes at the center .",
    "the total energy contained in the explosion is given by    @xmath29 and the right hand side is independent of time only if @xmath30      as @xmath31 , the compression ( i.e. ratio between the shocked and unshocked matter ) increases , and matter is concentrated into a thinner shell , while the interior contains gas with a finite pressure and negligible density @xcite .",
    "the density in the shell diverges , but the surface mass density remains finite @xmath32 the density in the interior ( behind the shell ) vanishes .",
    "the pressure inside the shell is obtained from rankine hugoniot equations @xmath33 but the pressure in the interior is @xmath34 this expression can be obtained from the implicit solution for the dimensionless pressure as a function of the dimensionless velocity @xcite . the material velocity at the front is equal to the velocity of the shock @xmath35",
    "since the density vanishes at the center , one might confuse it with a hollow explosion .",
    "however , in hollow explosions the pressure vanishes at a finite radius , while in this case the pressure remains finite throughout .",
    "we now turn to the energy balance of such explosion .",
    "energy can be distributed as either thermal or kinetic , and can be either inside the shell or behind it .",
    "the kinetic energy behind the shell is negligible because there s no mass there , and the thermal energy of the shell is negligible because its volume is very small . as @xmath31 ,",
    "the kinetic energy of the shell remains finite , but the thermal energy behind the shell diverges , because it is proportional to @xmath36 . hence most of the energy is concentrated behind the shell as thermal energy .",
    "we can also use this approximation to find the relation between the energy and the trajectory of the shock front @xmath37 substituting equation [ eq : shock trajectory ] yields    @xmath38^{1/\\left(5-\\omega\\right)}\\ ] ]    we will later use this model to obtain analytic results for perturbations in a gas with @xmath31 . a relevant question in this context",
    "is whether outside perturbations manage to cross the thin , dense shell and affect the inner region .",
    "on the one hand , the width of the shell goes to zero , but on the other hand , so does the speed of sound . from mass conservation and the rankine hugoniot relations ,",
    "the width of the shell is @xmath39 while the speed of sound at the shock front goes as @xmath40    so the time it takes for information to cross the shell scales as @xmath41 , and is therefore much smaller than the time it takes the explosion to double its size when @xmath31 .      as was mentioned earlier , when @xmath7 the hydrodynamic equations admit a simple analytic solution @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 we will later see that for this solution it is possible to obtain analytic solutions for the perturbation equations",
    "we now come to the case of a perturbed density profile .",
    "for the perturbation equation to be tractable we aim at a self similar solution by carefully choosing a perturbation whose characteristic wavelength scales like the radius .",
    "namely , we take the perturbed density profile to be @xmath46 where @xmath47 has dimensions of length and bears only on the phase of the perturbation , @xmath48 is the growth rate of the perturbation and @xmath49 is a small , real and dimensionless amplitude .",
    "we take the real part of any hydrodynamic complex quantity to be the physically significant element .",
    "we define perturbed flow variables @xmath50\\ ] ] @xmath51\\ ] ] @xmath52\\ ] ] @xmath53\\ ] ] to allow separation of variables , the function @xmath54 must satisfy @xmath55 where the parameter @xmath56 represents the amplification of each mode , and is determined by boundary conditions , as explained in the next subsection . if @xmath48 is imaginary , the real part of @xmath54 is periodic ,",
    "the solution is discretely self similar , i.e. it repeats itself up to a scaling factor in intervals of @xmath57 .",
    "while the unperturbed solution and the perturbations in their complex form are both self similar , the physical solution which is the real part of their sum is not .",
    "plugging the perturbed hydrodynamic variables into the hydrodynamic equations yields dimensionless odes for the perturbed variables @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions for the perturbed variables at the blast front are derived in a similar way to @xcite and are identical to those appearing in @xcite @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60-p'\\left(1\\right)\\label{eq : pert_rankine_hugoniot_pressure}\\ ] ] in analogy to the unperturbed solution , where the parameter @xmath28 is determined by the inner boundary conditions or total conservation of energy , the parameter @xmath56 is determined by the same considerations .",
    "integration of the self similar odes from the front to center with the wrong value of @xmath56 would yield non zero velocity at the center , so the energy flux does not vanish , and the total energy is not conserved .",
    "we recall that the energy flux is given by @xmath61 , but since the unperturbed density and velocity vanish at the center in filled type i explosions , the first order contribution to the flux would be @xmath62 .",
    "hence , it is sufficient to require that @xmath63 would vanish at the center . near the center",
    ", the derivatives of the self similar variables reduce to @xmath64 @xmath65    hence for generic values , the pressure perturbation would be constant , and the velocity perturbation would diverge as @xmath66 . recalling that the power radiated from the center is @xmath67 , we see that choosing the wrong boundary condition would mean energy transfer through the center ( periodic , if @xmath48 is imaginary ) .",
    "the condition for preventing the divergence of the velocity perturbation is    @xmath68    in case of primakoff explosions , the pressure also vanishes at the center , so they require a different treatment ( the energy also does nt change , but the conditions at the center are different ) . a more detailed discussion of perturbations to primakoff explosions is given in section [ sub : primakoff_pert ] .",
    "we note that condition [ eq : pert_centre_bc ] is different from both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the reason is that they treated angular perturbations , where the total energy of every perturbation always averages out to zero after summing over all angles , so energy considerations do not apply .",
    "the method of ryu and vishniac , @xmath69 , keeps the tangential velocity from diverging , so it is irrelevant for radial perturbations .",
    "thus , we can understand why there should be two separate conditions for radial and angular perturbations .",
    "we also note that in similar problem , e.g. perturbations to type ii explosions , the same inner boundary conditions are used both for radial @xcite and angular perturbations @xcite .",
    "while self similarity simplifies the problem by reducing the pdes to odes , the resulting odes , in general , do not admit analytic solutions .",
    "therefore , for each specific set of parameters @xmath2 , @xmath70 and @xmath48 , the functions @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and the parameter @xmath56 are found numerically .",
    "since the odes are linear , there exists a matrix that relates the vector of the values of the flow variables at the center to the same vector at the front @xmath74 it is possible to find this matrix numerically , since it is independent of @xmath56 . thus equation [ eq : matix_equation ] and",
    "the boundary conditions constitutes 4 linear equation for 4 variables ( @xmath56 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) .",
    "solving these equations yields the value of @xmath56 .",
    "a comparison between the the solutions discussed above and a hydrodynamic simulation is presented in figure [ fig : numeric_vs_analytic ] .",
    "all curves seem to agree .",
    "the numerical calculations were carried out using the hydrocode pluto @xcite .",
    "we have also verified that better accuracy can be achieved by increasing the resolution .",
    "however , infinite resolution will not reduce the error to zero , because of differences between the initial conditions in the simulation and those assumed in the mathematical formulation .",
    "one difference is the size of the initial hot spot . in the mathematical problem",
    "the hot spot is point like , while in the simulation it always has a finite size .",
    "another difference is the ambient pressure , which is assumed to be zero in the mathematical problem , while in the simulation it is also finite in the simulation .",
    "figure [ fig : numeric_vs_analytic ] shows that the wavelength of the density fluctuations is shorter than those of the pressure and velocity .",
    "this happens because the density is affected by both traveling sound waves and entropy waves , while the pressure and velocity are affected solely by sound waves . from this argument",
    "it follows that the characteristic wavelength are given by @xmath78 for the pressure and velocity , together with @xmath79 for density perturbations .",
    "finally , figures [ fig : d_vs_b_filled ] and [ fig : abs_arg_d_vs_b ] show @xmath56 as a function of @xmath80 , relating the fractional perturbation in the shock position to the fractional perturbation in the external density , for @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the oscillations are due to the diffraction of the incident wave from the blast front , with wave reflected from the center .",
    "this property is qualitatively different from the behavior of the same curves plotted for type ii explosions @xcite . in type ii explosions",
