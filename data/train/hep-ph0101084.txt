    "in particle physics experiments some particles have such a short lifetime that direct detection is impossible . in these cases",
    "the decay products have to be used to reconstruct the parent - particle distributions .",
    "for example , an invariant - mass analysis allows to determine the yield and also the transverse - momentum distribution of the parent particles @xcite .    in invariant - mass analyses it is essential to separate the invariant - mass peak from the combinatorial background .",
    "using an event mixing procedure an approximation for this combinatorial background can be obtained .",
    "the invariant - mass peak is then reconstructed from the total invariant - mass distribution by subtracting this background . in order to construct the background by means of such an event mixing procedure , particles originating from different events have to be combined in pairs .",
    "differences in the characteristics of the events used in the mixing procedure will cause the constructed background to deviate from the actual combinatorial background .",
    "the degree of deviation from the actual background depends on the position correlations of the decay particles .",
    "for instance , in the determination of the transverse - momentum distribution of the parent particles , this background has to be constructed for various transverse - momentum values .",
    "the influence of jet structures might be restricted to a certain transverse - momentum range , which implies that the correlations of the decay particles are related to the transverse momentum of the parent particles . in this way a systematical effect is introduced which affects ( the slope of ) the transverse - momentum distribution .    from the above it",
    "is seen that it would be preferable to use a method that does not require combination of particles from different events .",
    "such a method , which takes topological correlations of the particles within the event into account , is presented here .",
    "it is applied to the analysis of the decay process @xmath0 under circumstances matching those of pb+pb collisions at the cern - sps .",
    "the datasets used for evaluation of our analysis method were obtained by means of a computer simulation that models the @xmath1 spectra as observed in heavy - ion collisions at sps energies @xcite .",
    "+ a realistic energy resolution has been implemented to mimic the photon detection in an actual calorimeter system like the one of the wa98 experiment @xcite .",
    "the details of this simulation are given in section [ sec - compsim ] .",
    "consider a heavy - ion collision in which a certain amount of @xmath1s is produced .",
    "more than 98 percent of these @xmath1s will decay into a pair of photons .",
    "because of their short lifetime ( @xmath2  nm ) , the @xmath1s can be regarded to decay immediately after their creation at the interaction point . under realistic experimental conditions only a fraction of the decay photons will be detected .",
    "the energy and position of a photon @xmath3 are recorded in the detection system and will be denoted by @xmath4  and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "consequently , the four - momentum of each detected photon is determined .",
    "the invariant mass @xmath6 of a pair of photons with four - momenta @xmath7 and @xmath8 is computed in the following way  :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the angle between the momenta of the two photons .",
    "all possible combinations of two photons within an event will provide a distribution consisting of the @xmath1 invariant - mass peak and a combinatorial background .",
    "the latter being due to combinations of two photons which did not both originate from the same @xmath1 decay .",
    "the distribution obtained in this way will be called the total invariant - mass distribution @xmath11 .",
    "+ the combinations of energies and positions that constitute this @xmath11 distribution are indicated below    @xmath12    in which a combination @xmath13 yields an invariant mass @xmath14 .",
    "an example of such a total invariant - mass distribution , resulting for events containing 50 @xmath1s each , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t50 ] . here",
    "the @xmath1 peak at about 135  mev is seen positioned on top of a large combinatorial background .",
    "since the integral of the peak corresponds to the number of @xmath1s for which both decay photons were detected , being the basic ingredient in the studies of @xmath1 spectra , it is essential to separate the @xmath1 peak from the background . + this can not be done with sufficient accuracy in a straightforward way , since many combinations of photons that contribute to the background have an invariant mass close to the @xmath1 mass .",
    "in addition , the width of the reconstructed @xmath1 peak is relatively large , due to the limited energy and position resolution of the detection system , and the shape of the combinatorial background is unknown .",
    "+ if an accurate prediction of the ( shape of the ) background distribution could be obtained , the @xmath1 peak could be retrieved from the total invariant - mass distribution @xmath11 simply by subtracting this background .",
    "a distribution that accurately represents the combinatorial background can be obtained by means of an event mixing method . for each entry in the `` event mixing '' background distribution , two sets of photon momenta",
    "( obtained from two different events ) are used .",
    "one photon momentum is taken from the first of these two sets and another is taken from the second .",
    "these two are then combined to provide an entry in the invariant - mass distribution .",
    "+ the combinations used in the case of mixing events @xmath15 and @xmath16 , of which the numbers of detected photons are @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively , are given by  :    @xmath19}\\vec{x}_{1[\\rm{a}]}\\otimes e_{1[\\rm{b}]}\\vec{x}_{1[\\rm{b } ] } , \\\\ & & e_{1[\\rm{a}]}\\vec{x}_{1[\\rm{a}]}\\otimes e_{2[\\rm{b}]}\\vec{x}_{2[\\rm{b } ] } , \\\\ & & \\ldots \\\\ & & e_{n_{\\rm{a}}[\\rm{a}]}\\vec{x}_{n_{\\rm{a}}[\\rm{a } ] }    \\otimes e_{n_{\\rm{b}}[\\rm{b}]}\\vec{x}_{n_{\\rm{b}}[\\rm{b}]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the invariant - mass distribution obtained in this way is expected to describe the actual combinatorial - background distribution rather accurately .",
    "no combinations of two photons originating from the same @xmath1 decay occur .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1 peak will be absent . + an imperfection of this method is the fact that the two events used for mixing will have different position and energy distributions .",
    "in addition , for heavy - ion collisions also the centrality of the two events is different .",
    "the latter may be partly overcome by grouping the collisions into centrality classes and combining only events that belong to the same class .",
    "still , possible correlations in photon positions within the original event will surely be affected when a second event is used in the mixing procedure .",
    "+ since in general the @xmath1 peak is relatively small compared to the background , the error in the derived number of parent particles due to these effects might become substantial , especially in the case of constructing transverse - momentum spectra .",
    "below we present an alternative method to reconstruct both the combinatorial background and the invariant - mass peak signal of the parent particles .",
    "the procedure is carried out within one and the same event and as such does not require mixing of data from different events . +",
    "in order to perform this analysis a new distribution has to be constructed , to be called the `` position swapped '' distribution @xmath20 . for each entry in this distribution",
    "two photons are taken from a single event . however , before computing the invariant mass of this combination , one of the two photon positions is replaced by the position of a randomly chosen third photon from the same event .",
    "the combinations which constitute this @xmath20 distribution are given by @xmath21 , where @xmath3 and @xmath22 indicate photon @xmath3 and @xmath22 as before and @xmath23 denotes the randomly chosen third photon ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "unlike in the case of event mixing , only one event is used to compute each entry .",
    "an important advantage is that when the photon positions are swapped the global characteristics of the event are not modified , thus preserving possible topological correlations .",
    "+ in the case of azimuthal symmetry and a significant energy ",
    "position correlation for the photons , it is recommended to divide the photon sample into categories characterised by the photon polar angle . in this case the energy ",
    "position correlation can be maintained in the position - swapping process , by only combining photons belonging to the same category .    to enhance the statistical significance",
    ", the number of entries can be increased by allowing @xmath25 to take multiple values .",
    "furthermore , it is recommended to replace both @xmath5 and @xmath26 subsequently as described before to make sure that all of the photon positions occur with comparable statistical weights . in order to extract the signal",
    ", the @xmath20 distribution has to be normalised properly , as outlined hereafter .",
    "an example of the resulting @xmath20 distribution corresponding to the event sample reflected in fig .",
    "[ fig : t50 ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s50 ] .",
    "it is instructive to regard the @xmath20 distribution as being composed mainly of a combinatorial background with in addition small `` matching energy '' ( @xmath27 ) and `` matching position''(@xmath28 ) components .",
    "the meaning of these @xmath27 and @xmath28 components will be explained hereafter . + consider the case that photon @xmath29 and photon @xmath30",
    "are created by the decay of a certain @xmath1 . as a consequence , the combination @xmath31 will then contribute to the @xmath1 peak in the total invariant - mass distribution @xmath11 .",
    "in the position - swapping procedure , the combination @xmath32 will be encountered in the case that the randomly chosen photon is photon @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) . however , in this particular combination the energy @xmath35 happens to be the energy of the photon which actually originated together with photon @xmath29 from the decay of one and the same @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting entry in the invariant - mass distribution thus contains two photons with what we call `` matching energies '' and consequently contribute to the @xmath27 component .",
    "+ in a similar way , the combination @xmath36 contributes to the @xmath28 component in which both photon positions correspond to those of the two photons originating from the @xmath1 decay . here",
    "the randomly chosen photon happens to be photon @xmath30 , whereas the initial photon pair consisted of photons @xmath29 and @xmath33 .",
    "+ the @xmath27 and @xmath28 components of the @xmath20 distribution are intrinsically different from the combinatorial background , as outlined below .",
    "the remaining combinations entering the @xmath20 distribution yield a distribution in very good correspondance with the actual combinatorial background .",
    "consider the case that for some event @xmath37 photons are detected and that the @xmath1 invariant - mass peak for this event contains @xmath38 entries resulting from actual @xmath1 decays .",
    "the combinatorial background in the total distribution @xmath11 then consist of @xmath39 $ ] entries .",
    "the position - swapped distribution @xmath20 for this particular event has an @xmath27 component with exactly @xmath38 entries .",
    "the @xmath28 component will , statistically , have @xmath38 entries as well .",
    "the remaining @xmath40 $ ] entries in the @xmath20 distribution contribute to the combinatorial background .",
    "it is crucial to accurately determine the @xmath27 and @xmath28 contributions in order to determine the @xmath1 peak contents .",
    "first , the procedure to construct the @xmath27 distribution will be described .",
    "it will be explained hereafter that in this process an additional distribution @xmath41 is needed , consisting of entries of the form @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 represent random angles between two photon momenta from the same event .",
    "this distribution is normalised to have an integral equal to unity in order to ease a proper scaling to the actual peak contents afterwards .",
    "the invariant mass @xmath45 of the combination @xmath32 contributing to the @xmath27 distribution , in which @xmath33 is the randomly selected photon , is given by    @xmath46    as indicated by this formula , the @xmath27 component of the @xmath20 distribution is obtained by combination of the @xmath1 peak ( @xmath47 ) with the @xmath41 distribution in the following way  :    @xmath48    in a similar way we can construct a distribution that represents the @xmath28 component of the @xmath20 distribution . for this a distribution @xmath49 is needed that is constructed from ratios of random energies , i.e. @xmath50 , as indicated hereafter .",
    "+ the invariant mass @xmath51 of the combination @xmath36 is  :    @xmath52    consequently , the @xmath28 component of the @xmath20 distribution is obtained by combination of the @xmath1 peak ( @xmath47 ) with the @xmath49 distribution in the following way  :    @xmath53    we have now determined all the necessary components to construct the background of the two - photon invariant - mass spectrum .",
    "this will allow us to extract the number of entries in the @xmath1 peak due to genuine @xmath1 decays and thus the actual number of detected @xmath1s within a certain event sample .    the distribution that results",
    "when the @xmath20 distribution is subtracted from the @xmath11 distribution will be called the `` difference '' distribution @xmath54 .",

    "the @xmath27 and @xmath28 components corresponding to each of the trial gaussian distributions are obtained in the way described above . in this procedure",
    "the position - swapped distribution @xmath20 provides an accurate description of the combinatorial background .",
    "the four distributions @xmath11 , @xmath20 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are then combined to give a prediction for the @xmath54 distribution , denoted by @xmath56 .    in order to obtain the best matching of the calculated ( @xmath56 ) with the actual @xmath54 distribution , a @xmath57 value per bin is computed for each of the trial gaussian distributions .",
    "this is performed in the @xmath58 interval around the @xmath1 mass .",
