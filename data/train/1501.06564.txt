    "broad h@xmath1 emission in hh  900 extends beyond the edge of the globule along the outflow direction , but only to the point where [ fe  ii ] emission begins , indicating that molecules persist in this intermediate zone .",
    "extinction in the h@xmath0 image also hints at the presence of entrained dust that survives in the h  ii region close to the globule .",
    "continuum - subtracted [ fe  ii ] and h@xmath1 images are required to determine whether entrained dust and molecules also obscure the inner regions of hh  901 and hh  902 .",
    "hh  900 has two bow shocks separated from continuous emission in the inner jet , demonstrating that there has been a previous breakout of the jet into the h  ii region . despite this ,",
    "new near - ir images show evidence for a significant column of dust and molecules outside the globule entrained by the jet .",
    "this may be expected from the youngest sources that are still surrounded by a substantial molecular envelope with only a small cavity cleared by the jet @xcite .",
    "significant entrainment of molecular and dusty material by jets driven by more evolved protostars , or after many jet bursts , may be a direct consequence of the feedback - dominated environment ( see section  [ ss : enviro ] ) .",
    "compression of the molecular globule by massive star feedback may refill the cavity along the jet axis , increasing the amount of material entrained by a subsequent pulse of the jet .",
    "both hh  901 and hh  902 also show evidence for previous jet activity .",
    "if entrained material obscures the inner jet in all three cases , then this argues for a large column of material to be dragged out of the globule repeatedly by jet bursts .",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath21 @xmath22 for the pillar housing hh  901 , and we expect similarly high densities for the hh  902 and hh  900 clouds ( also see section  [ ss : ysos_globs ] ) .",
    "all three jets are embedded in the hot stellar wind bubble created by the many o - type stars in the nearby tr  14/tr  16 star cluster , so they are subject to similar amounts of feedback .",
    "jets emerging from more diffuse globules ( e.g. hh  666 , see * ? ? ?",

    "a bright point source with colours consistent with being a yso lies in the middle of this bright h@xmath0 filament and was identified as the possible driving source for the putative microjet . after examining the new imaging and spectroscopy presented here , we find it unlikely that this h@xmath0-bright feature is a separate microjet .",
    "the key arguments against the microjet hypothesis are ( 1 ) the morphology in the [ fe  ii ] images , ( 2 ) radial velocities in spectra , and ( 3 ) proper motions as detailed below .",
    "\\(1 ) the [ fe  ii ] emission indicates that the main body of the hh  900 jet is symmetric about the center of the globule and shows no significant deviation at the position of the putative microjet .",
    "[ fe  ii ] intensity tracings through both sides of the jet are similar , with no significant difference in the brightness of the western limb as compared to the east ( see figure  [ fig : feii_tracings ] and section  [ ss : morph ] ) .",

    "\\(3 ) the high degree of symmetry in the h@xmath0 filament on either side of the protostar combined with the lack of any radial velocity changes suggests that if this feature is indeed a jet , it must lie almost exactly in the plane of the sky .",

    ", it seems unlikely that this putative `` microjet '' is a separate jet at all .",
    "hypothetically , the yso that appears to lie at its center may have been ejected from the globule in a dynamical encounter , with the motion of the ejected star through the larger bipolar outflow creating a bright h@xmath0 tidal tail that looks like an h@xmath0 microjet .",

    "we find that the star moves almost imperceptibly in the h@xmath0 images , with a measured velocity in the plane of the sky of @xmath11 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the yso is not moving faster than the random motion of stars in the carina nebula , making the ejection scenario unlikely .",
    "at these low velocities , the dynamical time required for the star to reach its current position is @xmath27 yr , longer than the estimated dynamical age of the two outer bow shocks in hh  900 ( @xmath28 yr , see section  [ ss : morph ] ) , and much longer than the age of the inner jet ( @xmath29 yr , see section  [ ss : ysos_globs ] ) . given the discrepancy in the timescales for the star and the jet , any interaction between the star and hh  900 is likely due to the jet recently moving past the position of the yso .",
    "the simplest explanation is a chance alignment of the yso with the apparent center of the h@xmath0-bright filament .",
    "indeed , @xcite find a relatively high spatially averaged source density in the tr  16 subcluster near hh  900 ( 45 src pc@xmath30 in sub - cluster 12 ) .",
    "the h@xmath0-bright filament may result from local irradiation due to the small separation between the yso and the hh  900 outflow .",

    "the ir - bright yso that appears to lie in the middle of this filament must lie extremely close to the broad , bipolar outflow ( @xmath31 pc or @xmath32 au in the plane of the sky ) .",
    "uncertainties in the three - dimensional geometry of the system may hide a slightly greater separation , although the presence of especially bright h@xmath0 emission on either side of the yso suggests that the protostar may affect the larger , apparently separate outflow .",

    "relaxing the assumption that the jets are fully ionized and calculating the density required to self - shield generally increases the estimated mass - loss rate by at least an order of magnitude @xcite . for hh  900 , the situation is unfortunately even more complex . h@xmath0 and [ fe  ii ] have different spatial distributions and appear to trace different velocity components , suggesting that the mass - loss rate estimated from h@xmath0 only samples the mass contained in a thin ionized skin on the outside of the outflow sheath entrained by the [ fe  ii ] jet .",

    "may affect the envelope accretion rate , the amount of molecular and dusty material entrained by the jet ( as well as the degree that it can clear an outflow cavity in the molecular envelope ) , and the rate at which the developing protostar destroys the globule from within .",

    "fe  ii ] emission clearly bisects the globule , and dust lanes near the globule surface reveal the impact of the jet breaking out of the globule .",
    "together , this argues for the existence of a third protostar that remains deeply embedded in the globule and is obscured by high column density , perhaps by an edge - on circumstellar disc .",
    "the invisibility of this protostar may be interpreted as evidence that the source is extremely young , that the globule has been compressed to high densities by radiation from nearby massive stars , or both .",
    "our data allow us to reject the hypothesis that the yso ( pcyc  838 ) along the western limb of broader bipolar outflow drives a separate microjet .",
    "the [ fe  ii ] jet structure is symmetric and center on the globule ( not the star ) and there is no evidence for multiple velocity components in either h@xmath0 or [ fe  ii ] spectra .",
    "proper motions measured in h@xmath0 images taken with _ hst _ @xmath109 yr apart are consistent with zero velocity , calling into question the nature of this unusual feature .",
    "low velocities rule out a dynamical origin .",
    "nevertheless , the small projected separation between hh  900 and this yso suggests that the yso may illuminate the nearby bipolar outflow , creating an h@xmath0-bright filament .",
    "however , the simplest interpretation is that this yso is simply a chance alignment with the hh  900 outflow .",
    "the bright , collimated [ fe  ii ] jet , together with wider - angle h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 components point to a powerful jet breaking out of a small globule that is sufficiently massive to have survived the harsh radiative environment of the carina nebula .",
    "different morphologies and velocity structures from the optical and ir emission lines in hh  900 reveal the protostellar jet itself and offer a rare glimpse of the material it entrains before it is destroyed in the h  ii region .",
    "this supports the interpretation that the irradiated outflows in the carina reflect the same underlying phenomena driving molecular outflows in embedded regions , but that they are laid bare and illuminated by the harsh radiative environment .",
