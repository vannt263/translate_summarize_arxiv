    "it is well known that subspace migration is fast , effective and stable non - iterative detecting algorithm of small , perfectly conducting cracks in inverse scattering problem ( see @xcite for instance ) . however , for a successful application , information of applied frequency must be known .",
    "so , many researches assumed that applied frequency is known and investigated certain properties of single- and multi - frequency subspace migration algorithms , refer to @xcite and references therein .    however , if one has no _ a priori _ information of applied frequency , subspace migration is inadequate to detect unknown targets . particularly , in the problem of finding location of cracks ,",
    "some information of location can be examined but identifying exact location is still impossible .",
    "unfortunately , this fact has been examined heuristically through the results of numerical simulation so , as far as we know , mathematical analysis of subspace migration is still needed .",
    "this gives a motivation for this study to analyze structure of subspace migration and to develop an algorithm for finding exact location of cracks .    in this manuscript ,",
    "we extend the research @xcite of structure analysis of subspace migration with unknown frequency information .",
    "this is based on the fact that singular vectors associated with the nonzero singular values of multi - static response ( msr ) matrix can be represented by an asymptotic expansion formula in the existence of cracks . throughout careful derivation",
    ", we identify that subspace migration imaging functional can be represented by the square of bessel function of order zero of the first kind . based on this representation ,",
    "we investigate the reason why inexact locations of cracks are identified via subspace migration and develop a simple algorithm for finding exact locations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we survey two - dimensional direct scattering problems , the asymptotic expansion formula in the presence of small perfectly conducting cracks , and subspace migration . in section [ sec3 ] , we investigate the structure of subspace migration with unknown applied frequency by establishing a relationship with bessel function of integer order of the first kind .",

    "section [ sec4 ] presents some results of numerical simulations to support our investigation .",
    "section [ sec5 ] presents a short conclusion .",
    "in this section , we briefly introduce two - dimensional direct scattering problems in the presence of small , linear perfectly conducting crack(s ) , the asymptotic expansion formula , and subspace migration .",
    "first , we consider the two - dimensional electromagnetic scattering by @xmath0different linear perfectly conducting cracks with same small length @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath2 , @xmath3 , located in the homogeneous space @xmath4 such that @xmath5^\\mathrm{t}:-\\ell\\leq x_m\\leq\\ell\\right\\}},\\ ] ] and let @xmath6 be the collection of @xmath2 . in this paper , we assume that @xmath2 are sufficiently separated from each other .    let @xmath7 satisfies following helmholtz equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 denote _ unknown _ angular frequency with wavelength @xmath10 such that @xmath11 . in this paper , we assume that @xmath12 is positive definite and @xmath13 is not an eigenvalue of ( [ helmholtz ] ) .",
    "let us denote @xmath14 be the incident plane wave with direction @xmath15 on the two - dimensional unit circle @xmath16 , and @xmath17 be the unknown scattered field , which satisfies the sommerfeld radiation condition @xmath18 uniformly into all directions @xmath19 .",
    "the far - field pattern @xmath20 defined on @xmath16 can be expressed in the form @xmath21 uniformly into all directions @xmath19 and @xmath22 .",
    "then , based on @xcite , the far - field pattern can be represented as the following asymptotic expansion formula .    for @xmath23 and @xmath11 , the far - field pattern can be represented as follows : @xmath24      at this point , we apply ( [ asymptoticformula ] ) to explain an imaging technique known as subspace migration . from @xcite , subspace migration",
    "is based on the structure of singular vectors of the collected multi - static response ( msr ) matrix @xmath25_{j , l=1}^{n } = \\left [     \\begin{array}{cccc }       u_\\infty({\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}}_1,{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_1 ) & u_\\infty({\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}}_1,{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_2 ) & \\cdots & u_\\infty({\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}}_1,{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_n ) \\\\",

    ", we assume that we have coincide incident and observation directions , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "then , since the @xmath31th element of msr matrix can be represented as @xmath32 @xmath33 can be decomposed as follows @xmath34 where @xmath35^t\\ ] ]    with this decomposition , we can introduce subspace migration imaging algorithm .",
    "let us perform the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of @xmath33 as @xmath36 then , by comparing ( [ decomposition ] ) and ( [ svd ] ) , we can observe that the left- and right - singular vectors are satisfy @xmath37 note that based on the orthonormal property of singular vectors , we can observe that @xmath38 hence , we can introduce a filtering function , which is called subspace migration operated at @xmath12 ; @xmath39 here , @xmath40 . then , based on the orthogonal property ( [ orthonormalproperty ] ) , we can find locations of @xmath41 by finding @xmath42 such that @xmath43 .",
    "a more detailed discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "although , subspace migration is fast , effective and stable imaging algorithm , the frequency @xmath12 must be known . however , it is very hard to identify locations of cracks via the map of @xmath44 when applied frequency @xmath12 is unknown .",
    "this fact is well - known but has been identified via the results of numerical simulations .",
    "due to this reason , most of researches have been performed with _ a priori _ information of @xmath12 . in this section",
    ", we carefully explore the structure of subspace migration with unknown frequency and discuss its properties .",
    "for this purpose , we introduce a useful lemma .",
    "this will play a key role in our exploration .",
    "[ theorembessel ] suppose that @xmath45 spans unit circle @xmath16 .",
    "then , following relation holds for sufficiently large @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the bessel function of order zero of the first kind .",
    "since , @xmath12 is unknown , we can not use @xmath50 of ( [ vecw ] ) .",
    "so , let us choose a value @xmath51 and apply @xmath52 to ( [ subspacemigration ] ) such that @xmath53 then , we can obtain the following main result .",
    "[ structureofsubspacemigration ] for sufficiently large @xmath46 , subspace migration imaging functional @xmath54 can be represented as follows : @xmath55    since the incident and observation direction configurations are same , we set @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "then , applying ( [ singularvectors ] ) and lemma [ theorembessel ] yields @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "note that @xmath61 has the maximum value @xmath62 at @xmath63 .",
    "hence , map of @xmath54 will plot magnitude @xmath62 at @xmath64 instead of true location @xmath65 .",
    "this is the reason why inexact location of cracks are extracted via subspace migration .",
    "based on the result in theorem [ theorembessel ] , the values @xmath66 can be extracted via subspace migration but true location @xmath65 can not be identified unless estimating the value of unknown frequency @xmath12 . at this moment",
    ", we propose an algorithm to estimate the value of unknown frequency @xmath12 .",
    "the idea is very simple .",
    "let us create a small scatterer at @xmath67 .",
    "then , we can extract the value of @xmath68 via subspace migration . then , since we know the location of @xmath69 , we can obtain an estimated value of @xmath12 . hence , correspondingly , it will be possible to identify the location of @xmath65 .",
    "but , one has a problem : there must be no overlap between @xmath69 and @xmath65 for @xmath3 . if not , this method will be fail .",
    "however , we have no _ a priori _ information of @xmath65 so , selecting location of @xmath69 must be considered beforehand .",
    "fortunately , we know the value of @xmath66 .",
    "this means that although we do nt know the location of @xmath65 , we can find a line @xmath70 such that @xmath71 for @xmath3 .",
    "hence , we can estimate @xmath12 and correspondingly @xmath65 by selecting @xmath72 .",
