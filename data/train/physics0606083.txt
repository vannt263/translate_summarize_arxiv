    "the behavior of atoms , molecules and ions placed in a strong magnetic field has attracted a significant attention during the last two decades ( see , in particular , review papers @xcite ) .",
    "it is motivated by both pure theoretical interest and by possible practical applications in astrophysics and solid state physics .",
    "in particular , the knowledge of the energy levels can be important for interpretation of the spectra of white dwarfs ( where a surface magnetic field ranges in @xmath10 g ) and neutron stars where a surface magnetic field varies in @xmath11 g , and even can be @xmath12 g for the case of magnetars .",
    "recently , it was announced that in a sufficiently strong magnetic field @xmath13 g the exotic molecular ion h@xmath14 can exist in linear configuration with protons situated along the magnetic line @xcite ( for discussion see a review @xcite ) . in general , it is a metastable long - living system which decays to h@xmath15 .",
    "however , at @xmath16 g the ion h@xmath14 becomes stable .",
    "this system does not exist without or for weak magnetic fields .",
    "the ion h@xmath14 constitutes the simplest one - electron polyatomic molecular ion in a strong magnetic field .",
    "the h@xmath14 ion has been proposed as being the most abundant chemical compound in the atmosphere of the isolated neutron star 1e1207.4 - 5209 @xcite . a detailed review of the current status of one - electron molecular systems , both traditional and exotic , that might exist in a magnetic field @xmath17 g can be found in @xcite .",
    "the molecular ion @xmath18 is the simplest stable two - electron polyatomic molecular ion .",
    "it has a long history since its discovery by j.j .",
    "thomson @xcite .",
    "its exceptional importance in astrophysics related to interstellar media explains the great interest in this ion from astronomy , astrophysics and chemistry communities ( for a detailed review , see , @xcite ) . for all these reasons ,",
    "there have been extensive theoretical and experimental works on this molecular ion since the pioneering ( semi - quantitative ) work by coulson @xcite .",
    "the first variational calculations @xcite of the total energy of the molecular ion h@xmath0 showed that the equilibrium configuration might be either linear or equilateral triangular .",
    "however , this was not well - established until 1964 @xcite when it was shown that the equilibrium configuration for the state of the lowest total energy is an equilateral triangular configuration , while the linear configuration of the h@xmath0 ion may occur in excited state(s ) . since that time",
    "a large number of excited states has been studied @xcite ( for a general review , see @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", it has been found that there exists a single spin - triplet state which appears in a linear configuration @xmath7 .",
    "this is also the unique known state of h@xmath0 in the linear configuration .",
    "no spin - triplet states have been found for a triangular ( spacial ) configurations so far .    although the molecular ion h@xmath0 is characterized by the equilateral triangular configuration as being the optimal in field - free case , it is expected that in a magnetic field @xmath19a.u .",
    "( see below ) a linear configuration , parallel to a magnetic field direction , gives the lower total energy and becomes the optimal configuration .",
    "somehow , a similar phenomenon already happened for the one - electron exotic molecular ion h@xmath14 @xcite where the optimal configuration is triangular at @xmath20 g and becomes linear parallel at @xmath21 g .",
    "it is worth noting that for h@xmath0 in field - free case the difference between the total energy of the ground state ( triangular configuration ) and of the lowest linear configuration is very small , @xmath22ry , in comparison to characteristic energies in a magnetic field .    to the best of our knowledge there",
    "exists a single attempt to explore the molecular ion h@xmath0 in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we repeated all numerical calculations of this work following its guidelines with use of its formulas ( see below , tables  i , v , vi ) - in fact , no single number from @xcite was confirmed .",
    "however , in @xcite it was made a qualitative statement that with a magnetic field increase the transition from equilateral stable equilibrium configuration to linear equilibrium configuration may occur .",
    "this statement we confirm .",
    "we predict that this transition takes place at a magnetic field @xmath23a.u .",
    "a detailed study of a triangular configuration and of this transition will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "atomic units are used throughout ( @xmath24=@xmath25=@xmath26=1 ) , although energies are expressed in rydbergs ( ry ) .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath27 is given in a.u .",
    "with a conversion factor @xmath28 g .",
    "let us consider a system of three protons and two electrons @xmath29 placed in a uniform constant magnetic field .",
    "if for such a system a bound state is developed it corresponds to the molecular ion h@xmath0 .",
    "we assume that the protons are infinitely massive ( the born - oppenheimer approximation of zero order ) .",
    "they are situated along the magnetic field direction forming a linear chain ( we call it  the parallel configuration \" ) .",
    "the hamiltonian which describes this system when the magnetic field is oriented along the @xmath30 direction , @xmath31 is @xmath32 ( see fig .  1 for the geometrical setting and notations ) , where @xmath33 is the 3-vector of the momentum of the @xmath34th electron , the index @xmath35 runs over protons @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the interelectron distance and @xmath39 is the operator of the total spin .",
    "@xmath40 is a vector potential which corresponds to the constant uniform magnetic field @xmath41 .",
    "it is chosen to be in the symmetric gauge , @xmath42 finally , the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the z - components of the total angular momentum and total spin , respectively , and @xmath46 .",
    "[ figg ]     ion in linear configuration parallel to a magnetic field directed along @xmath30-axis . the protons ( marked by bullets )",
    "are situated on the @xmath30-line at distances @xmath47 from the central proton which is placed at the origin . ]",
    "the problem under study is characterized by three conserved quantities : ( i ) the operator of the @xmath30-component of the total angular momentum ( projection of the angular momentum on the magnetic field direction ) giving rise to the magnetic quantum number @xmath48 , ( ii ) the spatial parity operator @xmath49 which has eigenvalues @xmath50(gerade / ungerade ) ( iii ) the operator of the @xmath30-component of the total spin ( projection of the total spin on the magnetic field direction ) giving rise to the total spin projection @xmath51 .",
    "hence , any eigenstate has three explicit quantum numbers assigned : the magnetic quantum number @xmath48 , the total spin projection @xmath51 and the parity @xmath52 .",
    "for the case of two electrons the total spin projection @xmath51 takes values @xmath53 .",
    "as a magnetic field increases a contribution from the zeeman term ( interaction of spin with magnetic field , @xmath54 ) becomes more and more important .",
    "it seems natural to assume that for small magnetic fields a spin - singlet state is a state of a lowest total energy , while for large magnetic fields it should be a spin - triplet state with @xmath55 , where the electron spins are antiparallel to the magnetic field direction @xmath56 .",
    "the total space of eigenstates is split into subspaces ( sectors ) , each of them is characterized by definite values of @xmath48 , @xmath52 and @xmath51 .",
    "it is worth noting that the hamiltonian @xmath57 is invariant with respect to reflections @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( @xmath30-parity operator @xmath60 ) .",
    "hence , any eigenstate is characterized by the quantum numbers @xmath61 for positive / negative @xmath30-parity ( this symmetry accounts for the interchange of the nuclei @xmath62 and @xmath37 if they are situated symmetrically with respect to @xmath27 ) .    in order to classify eigenstates",
    "we follow the convention widely accepted in molecular physics using the quantum numbers @xmath63 and the total spin @xmath64 without indication to the value of @xmath51 . eventually , the notation is @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the spin multiplicity which is equal to @xmath67 for spin - singlet state ( @xmath68 ) and @xmath69 for spin - triplet ( @xmath70 ) , as for the label @xmath71 we use greek letters @xmath72 that mark the states with @xmath73 , respectively , and the subscript @xmath52 ( the spatial parity quantum number ) takes gerade / ungerade(@xmath74 ) labels describing positive @xmath75 and negative @xmath76 parity , respectively .",
    "there exists a relation between the quantum numbers corresponding to the @xmath30-parity ( interchange of nuclei a and c ) and the spatial parity : @xmath77 present consideration is limited to the states with magnetic quantum numbers @xmath78 because the total energy of the lowest energy state ( the ground state ) for any sector with @xmath79 is always larger than anyone with @xmath80 .    as a method to explore the problem we use the variational procedure . the recipe of choice of trial functions",
    "is based on physical arguments @xcite . as a result",
    "the trial function for a lowest energy state with magnetic quantum number @xmath48 is chosen in the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 stands for spin singlet ( + ) and triplet states @xmath83 , while @xmath84 stands for nuclear gerade and ungerade states , respectively .",
    "the @xmath85 is the permutation operator for electrons ( 1 @xmath86 2 ) and @xmath87 is the operator which interchanges the two protons @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "for @xmath90-permutationally symmetric case ( all protons are identical ) @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 as well as @xmath95 are variational parameters .",
    "their total number is eleven .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that in the trial function ( [ psi ] ) the interelectron interaction is included explicitly in the exponential form @xmath96 .",
    "calculations were performed using the minimization package minuit from cern - lib .",
    "multidimensional integration was carried out using a dynamical partitioning procedure : a domain of integration was divided into subdomains following an integrand profile and then each subdomain was integrated separately ( for details , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "numerical integration was done with a relative accuracy of @xmath97 by use of the adaptive d01fcf routine from nag - lib .",
    "a process of minimization for each given magnetic field and for any particular state was quite time - consuming due to a complicated profile of the total energy surface in the parameter space but when a minimum is found it took a few minutes to compute a variational energy .",
    "we carry out a detailed study of @xmath72 low - lying states with a particular emphasis of the state which has the lowest total energy for a given magnetic field - the ground state .      for the case @xmath98 we consider four subspaces in the hilbert space , @xmath68 ( @xmath99 , spin singlet states ) , @xmath70 ( spin triplet states ) at @xmath55 , @xmath100 ( gerade states ) and @xmath101 ( ungerade states ) .      for field - free case",
    "the system @xmath29 in linear configuration ( all protons are situated on a line , see , fig.1 ) the state @xmath5 is the lowest total energy state which is characterized by a shallow minimum ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in spite of developing a minimum for a linear chain the system is unstable towards any deviation from linearity .",
    "hence , this state is globally unstable .",
    "it is worth noting that the true ground state does exist and it corresponds to the equilateral triangular configuration ( the protons form equilateral triangle ) with the total energy @xmath105ry and the side of triangle @xmath106a.u .",
    "( see @xcite and also @xcite ) ) . )",
    "is used for the equilateral triangular configuration it gives @xmath107ry and @xmath108a.u .",
    "@xcite which is in quite good agreement with the results from @xcite ] a situation is not so different when a magnetic field is not strong , @xmath109a.u . :",
    "a linear parallel configuration with the protons situated along a magnetic line is characterized by well - pronounced minimum but a stability towards a deviation from linearity does not occur and a global bound state @xmath5 does not exist . however , with a magnetic field growth , at @xmath110a.u .",
    "the system @xmath29 becomes stable towards small deviations from parallel configuration and the @xmath5 state exists ( being an excited state , see below ) .",
    "we made a detailed study of the state @xmath5 of the @xmath18 ion in the linear parallel configuration , with a particular emphasis of the symmetric case @xmath111 ( see fig .  1 )",
    ", as well as small deviations from this configuration in a wide domain of magnetic fields @xmath112a.u .",
    "( see table  [ table1 ] ) . finally , for the linear parallel configuration the variational trial function @xmath113 ( [ psi ] ) with @xmath114 , @xmath104 and @xmath98 was used .",
    "it depends on eleven variational parameters .",
    "a simple , obvious generalization of ( [ psi ] ) is used to study slightly deviated configurations when stability of the linear system was checked .    .",

    "the energy and equilibrium distance of h@xmath122 for these magnetic fields is for a case when a linear configuration is kept externally ( see text ) , @xmath123  @xcite , @xmath124  our re - calculations based on the trial function from @xcite ( see text ) .",

    "a level distribution for several magnetic field strengths is shown on fig .",
    "if in field - free case there exist only two eigenstates in a linear configuration , but many more states in linear parallel configuration can appear when a magnetic field is imposed .        in general , for",
    "all studied states , as the magnetic field increases the equilibrium internuclear distances @xmath120 decreases and the system becomes more compact , while the total energies of spin - singlet states increase whereas that of spin - triplet states decrease .",
    "the state of the lowest total energy in linear parallel configuration depends on the magnetic field strength .",
    "it evolves from spin - singlet ( unstable towards a deviation from linearity ) @xmath102 for weak magnetic fields @xmath131a.u .",
    "to spin - triplet ( stable towards a deviation from linearity ) @xmath7 for intermediate fields and eventually to spin - triplet @xmath132 state for @xmath133a.u . which remains the ground state until the schwinger limit @xmath134 g .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that for weak magnetic fields , @xmath131a.u .",
    ", the global ground state is given by a triangular configuration @xcite and then , for larger magnetic fields , the global stable ground state corresponds to a linear parallel configuration .",
    "the h@xmath0 ion in the @xmath7 state is weakly bound . for all studied magnetic fields the total energy surface well corresponding to the ground state contains at least one longitudinal vibrational state .",
    "it is interesting to compare the evolution of the ground state for h@xmath0 with magnetic field change with that of other two - electron systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for atomic type h@xmath117 and he systems there is no domain of magnetic field where the spin - triplet , @xmath98 state is the ground state : for weak fields the ground state is the spin - singlet , @xmath98 state and then it becomes the spin - triplet , @xmath135 state for large fields .",
    "for the hydrogen molecule the @xmath7 state is unbound for all magnetic fields unlike the case of h@xmath0 .",
    "it implies that the h@xmath116 molecule does not exist as a bound system for @xmath136a.u . , where the unbound state @xmath7 has the lowest total energy at infinitely - large distance between protons .",

    ", where the @xmath132 state becomes the ground state , the lowest - lying excited state is @xmath7 .",
    "however , at @xmath143a.u .",
    "until the schwinger limit the lowest - lying excited state is @xmath144 .",
    "it is interesting to note that at @xmath145a.u . the h@xmath0 ion exists with @xmath132 as the ground state ( @xmath146a.u . ) with two possible excited states : @xmath144 ( @xmath147a.u . ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath148a.u . ) with energies below the threshold of dissociation to h@xmath149 ( @xmath150a.u . ) . for larger magnetic fields the situation becomes different .",

    "for the h@xmath0 ion ( @xmath152a.u . ) only one excited state , @xmath144 ( @xmath153a.u . ) , exists with energy below the dissociation threshold to h@xmath149 ( @xmath154a.u . ) .",
    "similar situation holds up to the schwinger limit @xmath155 g : a single excited state @xmath144 lies below the dissociation threshold .",
    "it is found that many states in linear configuration which do not exist for @xmath156 begin to be bound at relatively small magnetic field @xmath157a.u",
    ". a study of the existence of the bound states which might appear in a spacial configuration is our goal for a future study .",
    "another goal is related to a study of transition amplitudes for different electronic states .",
    "present consideration is based on the use of a simple variational trial function ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "this function can be easily generalized and extended in the same way as was done in a variational study of various one - electron systems in a strong magnetic field ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this will allow to improve the present results and might be done in future .",
    "however , we are not sure that such a study is crucially important .",
    "it is related to a fact that typical accuracies in astronomical observations of neutron star radiation would not be higher @xmath158 unlike to spectroscopical accuracies in laboratory where they can be by several orders of magnitude higher .",
