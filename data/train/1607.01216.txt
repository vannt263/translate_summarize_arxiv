    "the study of neutrino oscillations is moving into an era of precision with an intense enhancement in the activities of accelerator - based neutrino - oscillation experiments .",

    "@xcite . in recent years",
    ", several collaborations have reported muon neutrino cross sections on nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the challenges faced in these efforts , and especially those related to the neutrino - nucleus signal in the detector , need detailed microscopic neutrino - interaction models that can describe the variety of nuclear effects over the broad kinematical range probed .",
    "a thorough comparison of the cross - section measurements with theoretical predictions is crucial to assess the role of nuclear effects in the target s response and to reduce the systematic uncertainties in the extraction of the oscillation parameters . in this work",
    ", we aim at discussing the results of calculations for charged - current ( cc ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 scattering on @xmath0c , at the kinematics of the miniboone and t2k experiments .",
    "in particular , we focus on comparing our calculations with charged - current quasi elastic ( ccqe ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 measurements of miniboone  @xcite , and inclusive qe and ccqe @xmath2 measurements of ( off - axis near detector nd280 ) t2k  @xcite .",
    "one of the major objectives of this work is the investigation of the role of neutrino - induced low - energy nuclear collective excitations in miniboone and t2k s signal . to this end",

    "the crpa model was originally developed to describe exclusive electron- and photo - induced nucleon knockout reactions  @xcite .",
    "the model was later used to predict neutrino scattering at supernova energies both in charged - current ( cc ) and neutral - current ( nc ) reactions  @xcite .",
    "the formalism was further extended to the qe reaction region and successfully tested against electron scattering data for a variety of nuclear targets in the qe region  @xcite . here",

    "we solve the hartree - fock ( hf ) equations using the skyrme ske2 nucleon - nucleon interaction  @xcite .",
    "once the bound and continuum single - nucleon wave functions are determined , long - range correlations are taken into account by means of a crpa approach based on a green s function formalism .",

    "the rpa polarization propagator @xmath6 is obtained by the iteration of the first order contributions to the particle - hole green s function @xmath7 and is obtained as the solution to the equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the excitation energy of the target nucleus and @xmath10 is a shorthand notation for the combination of the spatial , spin and isospin coordinates .",
    "the @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ propagator ] ) corresponds to the hf contribution to the polarization propagator and @xmath11 denotes the antisymmetrized nucleon - nucleon ske2 interaction .",
    "the ske2 interaction was optimized against ground state and low - excitation properties of spherical nuclei .",
    "its strength lies in its ability to describe nuclear excitations in the few 10s of mev energy range . the same ske2 two - body interaction , that is used to solve the hf equations ,",
    "is used to calculate the crpa polarization propagator . in order to restrain the ske2 force from becoming unrealistically strong at high virtuality @xmath12",
    ", a dipole hadronic form factor is introduced at the nucleon - nucleon interaction vertices  @xcite .",
    "the continuum wave functions are obtained by solving the positive - energy schrdinger equation with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "hence , the distortion effects ( escape width ) from the residual nucleons on the outgoing nucleon is taken into account .",
    "a folding procedure is used to take into account also the spreading width of the particle states  @xcite , which makes the description of giant resonances more realistic within the crpa approach . in order to consider the influence of the nuclear coulomb field on the outgoing lepton",

    "the agreement between ( 1p-1h ) crpa and data is reasonably sound for forward scattering , but underestimates the data for more backward ( and suppressed ) scattering cross sections .",
    "the measurement of ccqe neutrino  @xcite and antineutrino  @xcite cross sections by the miniboone collaboration sparked off discussions about the nuclear effects active in the broad energy range covered by the flux . the ccqe(-like ) cross section in miniboone is defined as the process where one muon and no pions are observed in the final state .",

    "<S> method : :    the model takes the mean - field ( mf ) approach as the starting point ,    and solves hartree - fock ( hf ) equations using a skyrme ( ske2 )    nucleon - nucleon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> long - range nuclear correlations are taken    into account by means of the continuum random - phase approximation    ( crpa ) framework . </S>",
    "<S> results : :    we present our calculations on flux - folded double differential , and    flux - unfolded total cross sections off @xmath0c and    compare them with miniboone and ( off - axis ) t2k measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we    discuss the importance of low - energy nuclear excitations for the    forward bins . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : :    the crpa predictions describe the gross features of the measured cross    sections . </S>",
    "<S> they underpredict the data ( more in the neutrino than in the    antineutrino case ) because of the absence of processes beyond pure    quasielastic scattering in our model . at very forward muon scattering ,    low - energy nuclear excitations ( @xmath1 50 mev )    account for nearly 50% of the flux - folded cross section . </S>"
