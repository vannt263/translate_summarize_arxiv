    "the top quark , the heaviest fundamental particle with a mass about @xmath2 @xcite , plays an important role in the study of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( higgs boson ) as well as in the search of physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "moreover , the production of top quark anti - quark pairs is one of the main backgrounds in many of the processes related with the standard model ( sm ) and bsm , and it is crucial to measure its production cross section with very high precision .    the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has been in operation since 2009 , producing proton - proton collisions with a center of mass energy of @xmath3 until 2011 and @xmath1 in 2012 .",
    "this document presents the most recent measurements of the inclusive @xmath4 cross section with data collected using the atlas @xcite and the cms @xcite detectors .",
    "the most recent theoretical predictions for the top quark pair production cross section ( @xmath5 ) are @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite for a top - quark mass of @xmath8 . according to the sm , top quarks decay into a w boson and a b quark almost 100% of the times .",
    "this leads to final states with two w bosons and two jets coming from the b quark fragmentation . when both w bosons decay leptonically , the event contains two high momentum leptons with opposite charge , two undetected neutrinos which are measured as missing energy in the plane transverse to the beam axis ( @xmath9 ) , and at least two jets , where two of them originate from b quarks .",
    "the dilepton channel is optimal to measure the inclusive @xmath4 cross section due to the small background contribution from other sm processes . as will be presented in the following sections , the uncertainty on @xmath5 measurement in the dilepton channel",
    "is dominated by systematic errors .",
    "this analysis performed by the atlas collaboration @xcite exploits the fact that the @xmath4 , @xmath12 and @xmath11 processes dominate the muon - electron final state .",
    "the simultaneous measurement of all three cross sections is performed at @xmath3 using the full 2011 dataset .",
    "the cross section of these processes is extracted through a fit in a two - dimensional parameter space defined by the missing transverse energy ( @xmath9 ) and the jet multiplicity ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "events from @xmath4 production have large @xmath9 and large @xmath13 , whereas @xmath12 events have large @xmath9 but small @xmath13 , and finally , drell - yan ( @xmath11 ) events are characterized by small @xmath9 and small @xmath13 .",
    "the results obtained for the @xmath4 process are : @xmath14 the fiducial phase space is defined by the lepton cuts applied in the analysis : @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and it includes the @xmath17 decay mode .",
