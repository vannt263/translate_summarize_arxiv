    "giant ellipticals are red , have a high metal content , often have boxy isophotes , are supported by anisotropic velocity distributions , and have triaxial figures ( e.g. , de zeeuw & franx 1991 ) whereas lower - luminosity systems are bluer , less metal - rich , have disky isophotes , are flattened by rotation , and may well have nearly - oblate shapes ( davies et al .",

    "the nuclei of elliptical and lenticular galaxies , as well as the bulges of early - type spirals , often contain stellar and/or gaseous disks , possibly associated with a massive central black hole , as well as unresolved nuclear spikes , kinematically decoupled structures , and puzzling asymmetries .",
    "these _ nuclear _ properties loosely correlate with the _ global _ structure of the galaxies .",
    "for example , while the luminosity profiles of elliptical galaxies approach a power - law @xmath4 at small radii @xmath5 , giant ellipticals ( @xmath6 ) have _ shallow _ cusps ( mean @xmath7 ) and low - luminosity ellipticals ( @xmath8 ) have _ steep _ cusps ( mean @xmath9 ) ( jaffe et al .  1994 ; faber et al .",

    "2000b).=-2    at present , it is unclear to what extent the observed properties of these early - type galaxies , and the correlations between them , were acquired at the epoch of galaxy formation or result from subsequent dynamical evolution , possibly driven by a central black hole ( franx , illingworth & de zeeuw 1991 ; de zeeuw 1996 ; faber et al .",
    "1997 ; merritt 1999 ; bak & statler 2000 ) . key questions in this area include : what is the distribution of intrinsic shapes , tumbling speeds , and internal orbital structure of early - type galaxies ?",

    "what is the shape and extent of the dark halo ?",
    "what is the dynamical importance of the central black hole ?",
    "what is the distribution of metals , and what is the relation between the kinematics of stars ( and gas ) , the local metal enrichment , and the star formation history ?",
    "progress towards answering these questions requires a systematic investigation of the kinematics and line - strengths of a representative sample of early - type systems .",
    "the intrinsic shape , internal orbital structure , and the radial dependence of the mass - to - light ratio @xmath10 are constrained by the line - of - sight velocity distribution of the stars ( e.g. , van der marel & franx 1993 ; gerhard 1993 ) and by the gas kinematics ( e.g. , cretton , rix & de zeeuw 2000 ) . the absorption line - strengths can be used to infer the luminosity - weighted age and metallicity of the stellar populations ( gonzlez 1993 ; carollo , danziger & buson 1993 ; davies , sadler & peletier 1993 ; worthey 1994 ) .",
    "detailed studies of individual galaxies are valuable , but need to be complemented with a systematic investigation of the internal structure as a function of global properties , such as total luminosity and hubble type , and environment.=-2    studies of the kinematics and line - strength distributions of galaxies have traditionally relied on long - slit spectroscopy along at most a few position angles ( e.g. , davies & birkinshaw 1988 ; franx , illingworth & heckman 1989 ; bender , saglia & gerhard 1994 ; surma & bender 1995 ; statler & smecker  hane 1999 ) .",

    "we further restricted the objects to @xmath20 to avoid crowded fields and large galactic extinctions .",
    "all parameters except @xmath21 were taken from the lyon / meudon extragalactic database ( leda ; see paturel et al .",

    "we adopted a virgocentric flow model with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and the correction to the local group centroid of yahil , tammann & sandage ( 1977 ) . for galaxies in the virgo cluster , the coma  i cloud , and the leo  i group , which we refer to as ` cluster ' galaxies , we adopted common distances based on the mean heliocentric velocity of each group , taken from mould et al .",
    "the distances derived , respectively 16.3 , 13.7 , and 10.7  mpc ( 31.04 , 30.68 and 30.14 mag ) , are in good agreement with those derived from other measurements ( see , e.g. , ferrarese et al .",
    "2000 ) . for galaxies outside these three associations , which we refer to as ` field ' galaxies , we used individual distances .",
    "we took cluster and group membership primarily from tully ( 1988 ) and garcia ( 1993 ) , but also from other sources ( e.g. , turner & gott 1976 ; huchra & geller 1982 ; geller & huchra 1983 ; faber et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "the list of galaxies obtained with the above criteria contains 327 objects .",
    "we divided these into six categories by first separating ` cluster ' and ` field ' galaxies , and then splitting each of these groups in e , s0 , and sa galaxies , based on leda s morphological type ( e : @xmath24 , s0 : @xmath25 , sa : @xmath26 ) .",
    "this results in 29 e , 51 s0 and 37 sa galaxies in the ` cluster ' environment , and 47 e , 86 s0 and 77 sa galaxies in the ` field ' .",
    "we selected a _",
    "sample of objects from this complete list by populating the six ellipticity versus absolute magnitude planes nearly uniformly , using bins of 1 magnitude in luminosity and 0.2 in ellipticity ( where @xmath27 is derived from the axial ratio at the 25  mag  arcsec@xmath28 level in @xmath29 , as reported in leda ; for the spirals it effectively gives the inclination of the disk ) .",
    "this choice of bin size is appropriate given the range of absolute magnitude we want to cover , and the radial ellipticity variations observed in early - type galaxies .",
    "the result is 36 ` cluster ' galaxies ( 12 e , 12 s0 , and 12 sa ) , and 36 ` field ' galaxies ( 12 e , 12 s0 , and 12 sa ) , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : sample ] .",
    "a sample of this size is large enough to be sub - divided by morphology , environment and luminosity , yet small enough that complete mapping with  is possible .",
    "the 72 galaxies correspond to 22% of the complete sample and , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : sample ] , remain representative of it .",

    "@xmath31 is a distance - independent measure of absolute luminosity .",
    "our distances are in very good agreement with the sbf distances ( @xmath32 ) , and our @xmath21 correlates strongly with @xmath31 .",
    "only seven galaxies have distances differing by more than 0.5  mag ( half a bin ) from the mean offset . despite a simplistic approach ,",
    "our distance estimates are thus accurate enough for the chosen bin size .",
    "the complete list of galaxies is unbiased , but we did consider additional criteria when selecting the representative sample . in cases",
    "where more then one galaxy could be used to fill a given bin , we favored the one for which high spatial resolution imaging and kinematics are available , primarily hubble space telescope ( hst ) wfpc2 and stis observations from the hst archive .",
    "such observations are essential to constrain the mass distribution in the nuclei of the galaxies .",
    "similarly , we preferentially chose galaxies for which kinematics at large radii is available , for example through long - slit spectroscopy or hi observations .",
    "these data can be used to evaluate the importance of dark matter in the outer parts of the galaxies . in the case of s0 and",
    "sa galaxies , we also tried to obtain a representative mix of barred and unbarred systems .",
    "these choices introduce a bias in the selection , but this bias is hard to quantify .",
    "the ground - based observations were primarily compiled using the hypercat catalogue ( e.g. , prugniel et al .",
    "1997 ) and derive from a range of programs with different goals , but a large fraction of them were carried out as part of statistically complete surveys .",
    "thus , overall , we believe that the bias introduced is minimal , and that the advantages of working with a carefully crafted sample far outweigh the disadvantages .",

    "the ellipticities used are those from column 10 of tables  [ tab : props - cluster ] and [ tab : props - field ] , and are not necessarily applicable to the domain of the galaxy where the stellar rotation velocity was measured .",

    "each two hour pointing is typically split into four exposures of 1800 s each , dithered by one lenslet .",
    "we reduce and merge the raw exposures as described in paper i , and use the individual wavelength - calibrated and extracted spectra to derive maps of the stellar kinematics using the fcq method ( bender 1990 ) and an optimal stellar template ( paper i ,  5.2 ) .",
    "this provides the mean stellar velocity @xmath41 , the velocity dispersion @xmath33 , as well as the gauss - hermite moments @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which quantify the first - order asymmetric and symmetric deviations of the line - of - sight velocity distribution from a gaussian form ( van der marel & franx 1993 ; gerhard 1993 ) .",
    "we estimated the errors on the kinematic parameters by means of extensive monte - carlo tests : for each galaxy spectrum and its associated set of kinematic parameters , an initial noise - free galaxy spectrum was estimated by convolving the template spectrum with the corresponding analytic line - of - sight velocity distribution .",

    "this expands on the brief outline presented in  5.3 of paper i.      the emission lines need to be disentangled from the stellar absorption line spectrum of a galaxy .",
    "we use an algorithm similar to the one employed by emsellem & goudfrooij ( 2001 , in prep . ,",
    "see also goudfrooij & emsellem 1996 ) , which consists of the following iterative steps :    1 .",
    "we first derive the stellar kinematics ( @xmath41 and @xmath33 ) using the fcq algorithm and a single stellar template spectrum ( typically that of a k0 giant ) , and truncate the spectral domain when the brightest emission lines ( e.g. , [ oiii ] , h@xmath3 ) influence the results .",
    "the resulting maps are then median filtered to remove residual spurious values due to , e.g. , a low signal - to - noise ratio or , more likely , the presence of a strong emission line . 2 .",
    "we then build a spectral library , including both stellar and galactic spectra ( devoid of detectable emission lines ) in the same spectral domain but at higher spectral resolution than that of the  datacube .",
    "a linear combination of these spectra is fitted to each spectrum in the  datacube while masking out regions where emission lines may contribute , and taking into account the measured differences in @xmath41 and @xmath33 .",
    "we then subtract the fitted spectra to obtain  in principle  a pure emission - line datacube .",
    "all lines are simultaneously fitted using gaussians of the same velocity and width , by means of dedicated software .",
    "finally , we subtract the fitted emission - line datacube from the original  datacube to obtain pure stellar absorption - line spectra .",
    "this procedure generally works well with only two iterations .",
    "it is very effective in recovering faint emission and superior to narrow - band imaging .",
    "problems may occur when , for example , the emission lines have non - gaussian profiles , or when they do not probe the same physical regions .",
    "these problems can be solved during step  ( iii ) by generalizing the fitting functions and/or relaxing the fitting constraints .",
    "a more serious problem may come from the lack of proper stellar types in the spectral library ( e.g. super metal - rich stars ) .",
    "this can result in over- or underestimated emission - line fluxes , particularly in the case of the faint [ ni]@xmath805200 doublet usually lying close to the strong mg_b _ absorption lines . as a result , the library has to be tuned to each galaxy and sometimes even to different regions within a galaxy .",

    "the stellar velocities outside and in the ring itself are consistent with being equal to the systemic velocity , although any velocity difference of the order of 30  is difficult to detect in these regions due to the lower signal - to - noise of the spectra and/or the emission line contamination .",

    "the full survey will not be completed until 2002 , but the first results presented here demonstrate that the  measurements agree with previous high - quality long - slit kinematic and line - strength measurements .",
    "this establishes the scientific integrity of the instrument .",
    "it also shows that integral - field spectroscopy is a mature technique , superior to long - slit studies because of the fundamental advantage of complete spatial coverage .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the survey maps shows that early - type galaxies display a variety of line - strength distributions and kinematic structure which appears richer than often assumed .",
    "we have shown specific examples of minor axis rotation , decoupled cores , central stellar disks , and non - axisymmetric and counter - rotating gaseous disks .",
    "the provisional indication is that only a small fraction of these galaxies can have axisymmetric intrinsic shapes .",
    "the line - strength distributions appear to follow the surface brightness distribution closely .",
    "we have started to complement the  maps with high - spatial - resolution spectroscopy of the nuclear regions , using .",
    "spectroscopy for many of the sample galaxies is available in the hst archive .",
    "radial velocities of planetary nebulae and/or globular clusters in the outer regions have been obtained for some of the galaxies in our sample , and many more will become available to about 5@xmath43 with a special - purpose instrument now under construction ( freeman et al .",
    "2001 , in prep ) .",
    "we are analyzing the  maps by fourier techniques .",
    "this will provide the ellipticity , position - angle , and deviations from the elliptic shape of the contours of constant velocity dispersion , @xmath1 , and line - strengths , as a function of radius ( copin et al .",
    "2001 , in prep . ) .",
    "this approach has been customary for the analysis of the surface brightness distribution of early - type galaxies ( e.g , kormendy & djorgovski 1989 ) .",
    "the maps of mean velocity and @xmath0 can be quantified in a similar way , just as is possible for hi and co data ( franx , van gorkom & de zeeuw 1994 ; schoenmakers , franx & de zeeuw 1997 ; wong 2000 ; see also copin 2000 , copin et al .",
    "2001 , in prep . )",
    "doing this for the entire sample will provide a statistically reliable determination of the incidence of kinematically decoupled cores , embedded disks , and minor axis rotation , and will also provide parametrized input for statistical studies of , e.g. , the distribution of intrinsic shapes ( franx , illingworth & de zeeuw 1991 ; bak & statler 2000 ) and the construction of dynamical models .    the detailed measurements for individual objects will be compared with fully general galaxy models constructed by means of schwarzschild s ( 1979 ) numerical orbit superposition method ( cf .",
    "rix et al .",
    "1997 ; van der marel et al .  1998",
    "; cretton et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the modeling uses all appropriate imaging and spectral data available , including hst and  spectra , to constrain the mass of a central black hole and the orbital structure in the main body of the galaxy . when combined with the constraints on the stellar populations derived from the line - strength distributions ( kuntschner & davies 1998 )",
    ", this will shed new light on the fundamental connections between the large and small scale dynamics , the formation ( and existence ) of supermassive bhs and galactic nuclei , and the history of metal enrichment in early - type galaxies .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the ing staff , in particular rene rutten , tom gregory and chris benn , for enthusiastic and competent support on la palma .",
