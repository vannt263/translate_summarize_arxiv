    "the realization of raman - induced artificial gauge fields in ultracold atomic gases @xcite provides a well - controllable way to investigate many fundamental phenomena induced by soc @xcite . among these studies , the spin - orbit ( so ) coupled bose gases , which have no counterpart in conventional solid materials , are of particular interests in cold atom community .",
    "one of the important consequence brought by soc is the degeneracy in the single - particle ground states , which play a centre role in determining the many - body ground states of becs .",
    "many new phases as well as phase transitions are predicted to appear in diverse bose systems with different types of soc @xcite .",
    "for example , the stripe and plane wave phases @xcite , half - vortex ( meron ) ground states @xcite , and fractional skyrmion lattices @xcite may emerge in so coupled becs .    despite of different proposals to generate soc in ultracold atoms @xcite ,",
    "so far for bose gases , the artificial soc has been realized only in one dimension @xcite or in 2d lattices @xcite .",
    "recently , the technique of laser - assisted tunneling @xcite is developed to produce strong ( staggered ) magnetic fields in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "such method provides a powerful and delicate way to manipulate atoms in lattice potential .",
    "stimulated by these developments , some authors @xcite have proposed an alternative and realistic way to realize an effective 2d soc in bilayer bose systems based on the laser - assisted tunneling . in such schemes ,",
    "the prerequisite  internal \" states to fabricate soc are essentially replaced by the raman - assisted  external \" motional states in each layer , providing a new system to investigate the so coupled becs .",
    "motivated by the above advances , in this paper , we consider a gas of ultracold scalar bosons subjected to a raman - assisted 1d optical lattice potential forming a multilayer system . within the lowest band of the lattice , the system can be mapped to an effective model with soc , where @xmath1 different layers play a role of a pseudospin @xmath2 coupled to the intralayer motion via the laser - assisted tunneling of atoms between the layers .",
    "this scheme can avoid the using of near resonant light beams which cause heating in previous experiments @xcite , and can be applied to a wide range of atom species including fermions .",
    "recently , a related scheme has been experimentally implemented to realize the effective soc with double well potential formed by an optical superlattice @xcite . in such a scheme",
    "the double layer is in a direction of the atomic motion . on the other hand , we suggest to use a lattice with @xmath1 sites in a direction perpendicular to the atomic motion .",
    "this is a spirit of bosonic ladders @xcite , but the atoms now undergo a planar rather than a one - dimensional motion .",
    "we determine the ground states of the system in the presence of atomic interactions .",
    "note that , the dynamics of a so coupled bec in a weakly tilted optical lattice has been studied @xcite , where the correlated bloch oscillations with spin hall effect are revealed . here , the one - dimensional optical lattice potential is sufficiently tilted and unlike the typical atom - atom interactions in conventional spinor bec @xcite , the special type of interactions from on - site repulsions in our system is quite different in the psuedospin representation , and can give rise to peculiar @xmath1-dependent phase diagrams with different behaviors : ( 1 ) for even @xmath1 , by tuning the tunneling strength @xmath3 , the single - particle ground state may change from a single minimal with zero - momentum to double minima with finite momentum , with the corresponding many - body ground states evolving from a normal phase to a robust stripe phase .",
    "( 2 ) for odd @xmath1 ,",
    "the single - particle states only minimize at zero - momentum .",
    "however , when the interaction strength is increased , a stripe / plane wave phase with finite momentum can still emerge in the ground states .",
    "such unique features reflect the competition and compromise between raman - assisted tunneling and atomic interactions in this system .",
    "we consider a three - dimensional ultra - cold bose gas ( e.g. @xmath4rb ) loaded into a one - dimensional optical lattice potential .",
    "such potential are tight enough that the atoms only occupy the lowest energy band of the lattice potential ( along @xmath5-axis ) , but move freely in the traverse @xmath6-plane , forming a stacked - disk configuration .",
    "furthermore , we apply a linear gradient potential in @xmath5-direction to tilt the lattice , as depicted in fig .",
    "( [ scheme ] ) .",
    "such global tilt can be achieved by implementing a time dependent frequency shift between the lasers for the creating of the lattice potential @xcite , or by tilting the lattice along the direction of the gravitational field @xcite .",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian of this system reads : @xmath7 with @xmath8 where @xmath9 annihilates a boson at position @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are the strengths of optical and linear gradient potential respectively , and @xmath13 is a weak harmonic potential along z - axis with @xmath14 the trapping frequency . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the momentum and mass of atom , and @xmath17 is the wave - vector of laser to generate the lattice potential .",
    "when the tilting is not too large , the atoms can still move in the lowest state of each well , forming the energy band of the lattice potential .",
    "we can expand the field operator @xmath18 with the localized wannier function @xmath19 of the @xmath20th lattice , where @xmath1 is the lattice number .",
    "the hamiltonian .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) then can be rewritten as : @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is the on - site energy and @xmath23 .",
    "when neglecting the small @xmath24 , the energy differences between adjacent sites are mainly caused by the linear - tilted part , which is given by @xmath25 . generally , there should also be a tunneling matrix element @xmath26 between adjacent sites @xmath27 .",
    "however , for a sufficiently tilted lattice potential , the inter - site tunneling is much smaller than the energy mismatch between two sites , i.e. @xmath28 . for example , @xmath29 for @xmath30 with @xmath31 the recoiling energy of the lattice @xcite . as a result",
    ", the direct tunneling is inhibited and hence can be neglected . to restore the atomic hopping between adjacent wells",
    ", we resort to the newly developed laser - assisted process @xcite .     to an excited state @xmath32 and",
    "would induce an interlayer transition ( see the context for detail ) .",

    "notice that , it is the factor @xmath56 due to the momentum transfer along the z - axis making the overlap integral @xmath3 nonzero . under the rotating - wave approximation , one can drop the counter - rotating terms and arrive at the following effective single - particle hamiltonian @xmath57\\phi . \\label{effective}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the @xmath5- component of angular momentum matrix with angular momentum @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the two - photon detuning .",
    "furthermore , we have also included an additional harmonic trap @xmath24 , which can be termed as an effective quadratic zeeman energy @xmath62 ( @xmath63 is the lattice spacing ) by adjusting the trapping center . due to @xmath64\\equiv\\mathcal{m}f_z - f_z\\mathcal{m}\\neq 0 $ ] , eq .",
    "( 4 ) effectively describes a system with nontrivial spin - orbit coupling , which reduces to a familiar form with equal rashba and dresselhaus contributions @xcite for @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the major difference is that the internal spin states now are played by atoms in different wells and the total pseudospin can be varied via the lattice number @xmath1 .    before proceeding ,",
    "we should mention that there are generally bloch oscillations for atoms in a tilted optical lattice potential @xcite . for sufficiently tilted lattice case as discussed above , the energy difference @xmath33 between adjacent sites is much larger than the suppressed inter - site tunneling @xmath67 . in this regime ,",
    "the bloch oscillation becomes a rapid shivering motion with frequency @xmath68 and amplitude @xmath69 .",
    "when the two - photon raman transition is introduced , @xmath33 reduces to a two - photon detuning @xmath70 , and a considerable effective tunneling @xmath3 is induced . in this case",
    ", it was shown that the coherent bloch oscillations of frequency @xmath71 would appear in the form of a periodic breathing dynamics @xcite or a periodic center of mass motion @xcite . in the following",

    "we first discuss the single particle states of this system . in the absence of effective zeeman fields ,",
    "( [ effective ] ) bears the time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) with @xmath81 , resulting in a symmetrical single - particle energy spectrum @xmath82 . due to the laser - assisted tunneling @xmath3 ,",
    "the atoms in different wells get mixed , and hence the degeneracy of psuedospin components is lifted with @xmath1 energy branches .",
    "we are interested in the lowest branch , which is responsible for the determining of bosonic ground states .",
    "in general , the single - particle ground - state manifold can be classified into two categories : for even @xmath1 , there may exist a two - fold degeneracy ; while for odd @xmath1 , there is only one state in the ground subspace . as shown in fig .",
    "( 2a ) , we plot the lowest energy spectrum by diagonalizing hamiltonian .",
    "( [ effective ] ) for different @xmath1 ( @xmath83 ) with @xmath73 . as we can see that , for odd @xmath1 ( @xmath84 )",
    ", there is only one minimum state at @xmath85 . while for even @xmath1 ( @xmath86 ) , double minima at @xmath87 can be identified . here",
    ", we have also included a weak harmonic trap with @xmath75 . as the quadratic zeeman term does not break the trs",
    ", it would just modify the ground state energy for small @xmath88 without destroying the degeneracy . on the other hand",
    ", a nonzero linear term @xmath89 would break the trs and lead to asymmetric energy spectra . as a result ,",
    "such possible degeneracy is lifted with only one state left in the ground - state manifold .    in fig .",
    "( 2b ) , we plot the momentum evolution of minimal states as a function of @xmath3 for even @xmath1 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "one can find that , when @xmath3 surpasses a critical @xmath90 , @xmath91 would converge to @xmath92 , indicating a tunneling induced transition would happen in the single - particle ground state . as we will see in below , above different behaviors of the single - particle states would have dramatic effects on the many - body ground states when the atomic interactions are included .",
    "we now turn to investigate the many - body ground states of this system in the presence of atom - atom interactions . considering a short - ranged case , the interactions for atoms situated in the same well is much stronger than that in different wells .",
    "then , one can neglect the contribution from the latter and write the interacting hamiltonian of atoms as @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes the atomic density in @xmath20th layer and @xmath95 with @xmath96 the contact interaction strength .",
    "notice that , the interactions here only happen in each pseudospin component , which keeps invariant under the unitary transformation @xmath97 , and would play an important role in determining the ground - state configurations .     plane for @xmath65 , consist of three phases : stripe , plane wave and normal phases ( see the context for detail ) , touching at a tricritical point .",
    "the color bar denotes the magnitude of ground state momentum .",
    "the green solid lines label the parameters we used in fig.([even_property ] ) . ]    to guide the analysis , in the following we would discuss the  even \" and  odd \" n cases independently , which exhibit different behaviors in the single - particle spectra as well as the many - body ground states .      in this case , we find that for giving trapping potential @xmath88 , the phase diagrams in @xmath98 plane for different @xmath1 have similar structures , and three different phases may appear : ( i )  stripe \" phase , where the wave - function is a superposition of two plane waves with opposite momenta @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) and @xmath101 ; ( ii )  plane wave \" phase , where only one plane wave component with finite momentum @xmath102 contributes to the ground state ; ( iii ) a  normal \" phase with bosons condensed in the zero - momentum state of @xmath85 .    to be more specific and without loss of generality , we choose the simplest @xmath65 for illustrations . in fig .",
    "( 3 ) , we give the ground - state phase diagram in the @xmath103 plane for @xmath65 by numerically minimizing the energy @xmath104 .",
    "generally , due to the interplay between atomic tunneling and atom - atom interactions , above three phases may compete with each other and survive in three distinct regimes ( labeled by colors ) , touching at a tricritical point .    in the dilute limit ( @xmath105 ) , above a critical tunneling strength , i.e. @xmath106 , the system is in the zero - momentum normal phase . while for @xmath107 , a stripe phase is favored . and",
    "between them ( @xmath108 ) , a plane wave phase is expected to have lower energy .",
    "the regime of such plane wave phase gets diminished with increasing of interaction @xmath109 , and finally disappears at a tricritical point around @xmath110 , where three phases merge . beyond the tricritical point ,",
    "only normal to stripe phase transition survives ( referred to fig .",
    "( [ even_property]b ) and ( [ even_property]d ) ) .",
    "these features essentially reflect the competitions between kinetic and interaction energies of these states . in the weak interaction regime ,",
    "the kinetic energy is dominant , and the system is always in a normal phase when the single particle spectrum has only one minimum at @xmath85 . on the double minima side ,",
    "the kinetic energies of stripe and plane wave phases for the same @xmath102 are degenerate , and would be further lifted by the atomic interactions .",

    "( [ even_property ] ) , we plot the ground - state momenta @xmath102 and the interlayer polarization @xmath111 as functions of tunneling @xmath3 for two typical interaction strength .",
    "one can see that , the plane wave has homogeneous intralayer density @xmath115 but finite interlayer polarization @xmath116 , while the stripe phase has inhomogeneous density @xmath117 with @xmath118 .",
    "on the other hand , due to the atoms in the same layer repulse each other , it tends to have both equal populations and homogeneous densities in each layer .",
    "hence , close to the normal phase , the plane wave phase with small @xmath119 but homogeneous intralayer density is more favorable .",
    "while with decreasing of @xmath3 , @xmath119 becomes larger and larger , and the system transits into the stripe phase .",
    "moreover , the plane wave phase would be also suppressed by increasing of interactions and turn to a normal phase continuously .",
    "such two transitions finally meet at a quantum tricritical point .",
    "several remarks are on hand : first , we have taken @xmath120 in numerical calculations , which gives no physical effects for @xmath65 and would modify the phase boundaries slightly for @xmath121 .",
    "second , compared to the effective model in @xcite , here the _",
    "external states _ in different layers play the role of spin rather than the _ internal states _ , and the corresponding effective spin - spin interactions take @xmath122 with @xmath123 , much larger than the previous case , where @xmath124 is very close to the degenerate point @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "this makes the stripe phase in this system quite robust @xcite .",
    "third , for @xmath121 , the phase diagrams are qualitatively unchanged around tricritical regime and similar analysis can be applied .",
    "plane for @xmath66 .",
    "the color bar denotes the momentum magnitude of ground states .",
    "the green solid lines label the parameters we used in fig.([odd_property ] ) . ]",
    "when @xmath1 is odd , the situation changes a lot and the phase diagrams may exhibit different behaviors . to be specifc ,",

    "( [ odd_n ] ) , we give the phase diagram for @xmath66 .",
    "it is interesting to see that even though the single - particle spectrum only minimized at @xmath85 state , the system can still be plane wave or stripe phases carrying finite momenta in some regimes . in one hand ,",
    "the zero - momentum normal phase is predominant for small @xmath109 . in the other hand",
    ", the interaction energy would become significant with the increasing of interactions . as shown in fig .",
    "( [ odd_property]e , f ) , the density of normal phase @xmath130 in center layer is relative large . and for sufficient large @xmath109 , an instability to plane wave / stripe phases with more delocalized atomic distribution and finite @xmath102 ( fig .",
    "( [ odd_property]a , b ) ) would happen , where the increasing of kinetic energies is compensated by the decreasing of interaction energies .",
    "furthermore , similar to the even @xmath1 case , the plane wave phase with a finite @xmath131 ( fig .",
    "( [ odd_property]c , d ) ) only survives for moderate tunneling strength @xmath3 , between the normal and stripe phases , and ends at a tricritical point .",
    "it is worthy to stress that , the emerging of plane wave / stripe phases for odd @xmath1 is mainly driven by atom - atom interactions , sharply contrast to the even @xmath1 case , where the role is mainly played by atomic tunnelings .",
    "this may reflect the topological differences of single - particle ground - state manifolds between these two cases .",

    "limited to a weakly interacting regime .    up to now",
    ", we have neglected the effects of effective zeeman fields @xmath70 and @xmath150 . for not too large @xmath70 and/or @xmath150 ,",
    "the phase boundaries would be modified quantitatively @xcite which are also confirmed in our case , while leaving the main results qualitatively unchanged . to detect these phases in experiments",
    ", one may implement the momentum - resolved time - of - flight measurements .",
    "the atom population in each well which characterizes @xmath111 and @xmath127 , can be measured via @xmath151-@xmath152 absorption imaging .    in conclusions ,",
    "we have investigated the ground states and the associated phase diagrams of a bec in a laser - assisted 1d optical lattice .",
    "the unique @xmath1-dependence of the single - particle spectra and the corresponding many - body ground - state configurations reflects the subtle competition between the effective soc induced by laser - assisted tunneling and atom - atom interactions .",
    "our results would have potential implications in searching new matter states in spin - orbit coupled bose systems with large spin .",
    "in future studies , one may consider the effects of interlayer long - range interactions , and the extensions to multicomponent becs and fermi gases .",
    "for weakly interacting bose gases , the quantum fluctuations can be neglected safely .",
    "and one can adopt the variational method @xcite to investigate the ground states of the system . in mean - field level , the variational ansatz of the ground - state wave - function can be constructed as : @xmath153 where @xmath154 are the eigenstates of the lowest energy branch with momentum @xmath155 , determined by eq .",

    "<S> we study the ground - state behavior of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a raman - laser - assisted one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , such system can be described by an effective model with spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) of pseudospin @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the lattice number ) . due to the intricate interplay between atomic interactions , soc and laser - assisted tunnelings , the ground - state phase diagrams generally consist three phases  stripe , plane wave and a normal phase with zero - momentum , touching at a quantum tricritical point . </S>",
    "<S> more important , even though the single - particle states only minimize at zero - momentum for odd @xmath1 , the many - body ground states may still develop finite momenta . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying mechanisms are elucidated . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide an alternative way to realize an effective spin - orbit coupling of bose gas with the raman - laser - assisted optical lattice , and would also be beneficial to the studies on soc effects in spinor bose systems with large spin . </S>"
