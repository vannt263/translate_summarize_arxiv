    "the pioneering @xmath18-band near - infrared survey of @xcite was the first to identify galaxies with red colors of @xmath19 , and hypothesised these to be either a new class of galaxy at @xmath20 , or ellipticals at @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite named these galaxies extremely red objects ( eros ) for their extreme optical to infrared ( ir ) colors ( e.g. , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24)_{vega}>6.5 $ ] ) and recorded the first redshift for an ero of @xmath25 .",
    "we now know that the class of eros consists of two @xmath26 sub - populations : galaxies with old red stellar populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or star - forming galaxies with strong dust - obscuration ( e.g. , from interaction and/or orientation ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    since the highest mass galaxies at this redshift are often found to be eros ( @xmath27",
    "; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and because eros also exhibit very strong clustering , comparable to the local clustering of massive elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , eros have been posited as the progenitors of massive local ellipticals .",
    "this is important because the formation history of massive galaxies provides a crucial test of galaxy formation models .",
    "a key part of any such test is to link high and low redshift galaxy populations , and with the advent of large - area ir surveys , eros provide an ideal and easily accessible testing ground for this purpose @xcite .",
    "one powerful means of linking galaxy populations across redshift is through clustering and the ( dark matter ) halo occupation model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the case of massive dark matter halos , simulations of dark matter structure evolution such as the millennium run @xcite demonstrate that massive halos evolve rapidly in mass but little in ( comoving ) space over cosmic time .",
    "since the most massive galaxies occupy the most massive halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they too grow in mass but their ( comoving ) spatial distribution evolves slowly .",
    "this means that accurate measurements of ero spatial clustering and host halo mass can be used to link these massive @xmath28 galaxies with local galaxy populations .",
    "previous studies have all found that eros are very strongly clustered ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the existing estimates of the clustering strengths , as measured by the scale @xmath9 where the two - point correlation strength is unity , show a broad range ( @xmath29mpc ) that makes it difficult to link the higher redshift eros with local galaxy populations",
    ". many of these discrepancies are likely due to differing selection criteria and cosmic variance due to small survey areas and sample sizes .",
    "differences in methodology between studies , such as redshift distribution models and uncertainty estimates , are also possible contributors .",
    "we discuss the consequences of these factors below .",
    "the diversity in ero selection criteria are largely due to pragmatic choices for selecting high - redshift galaxy populations in different data sets .",
    "the present range of ero selection criteria include ( but are not limited to ) : @xmath30 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath31 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath32 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath24)_{\\rm{vega}}>6.5 $ ] ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the consequences of using different ero selection criteria have been considered in some studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that @xmath33 of eros were selected by both @xmath34 and @xmath35 criteria , with the main difference being a shift in the mean redshift ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite attribute the difference in clustering between @xmath37 and @xmath38 selected eros to be a consequence of their difference in @xmath36 .",
    "@xcite replaced the @xmath18-band with irac @xmath39 m , and suggested that ero samples selected by this color will include more dusty eros with star formation than @xmath40band selected eros ( as we will discuss in  [ separation ] ) .",
    "morphological and spectroscopic studies of eros show them to be a mixture of galaxies with and without star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the relative fractions of dusty galaxies with active star formation ( hereafter , star - forming ) , and galaxies dominated by old stellar populations and little ongoing star formation ( hereafter , passive ) depends on the ero selection criteria and the limiting magnitude ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sub - populations can be very broad , as star - forming eros can have star formation rates ( sfrs ) of between @xmath41 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but distinguishing further between sub - populations of star - forming eros is beyond the scope of this study . separating",
    "passive from star - forming eros is important because we should not expect the two ero types to possess the same stellar mass , occupy the same mass dark matter halos or be the progenitors of the same local galaxy populations .",
    "different fractions of these two ero sub - populations selected by different ero criteria may well explain the large differences seen in ero clustering studies .",
    "unfortunately , accurate morphological and spectroscopic classifications are often unavailable for the sources used in ero clustering studies . in most cases ,",
    "colors are used to distinguish between star - forming and passive eros .",
    "nir colors ( e.g. , ( @xmath42 ) ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can not adequately distinguish between the ero types if they do not bracket or straddle the @xmath43  break , which does not work for all eros ( only @xmath44 ) , and requires high precision photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the mid - ir color techniques introduced by @xcite ( @xmath13-[24]$ ] ) and @xcite ( @xmath13-[8.0]$ ] ) are more promising because they use the emission from hot dust in star - forming galaxies to obtain a better separation of the two ero types .",
    "however , these mid - ir color techniques require space observatory imaging , which is not always available .",
    "accurate spatial clustering measurements require reliable redshift distributions , but there are relatively few eros with spectroscopic redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and spectroscopic samples at high - redshift are vastly incomplete ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "typically , redshift distributions are assumed to have a particular shape or are derived from photometric redshifts or both .",
    "this can be a problem because spatial clustering analyses are strongly dependent on the shape of the redshift distribution , contributing to the spread in previous clustering estimates .",
    "unfortunately , using photometric redshifts and models of the redshift distribution remains the best methodology available at present .",
    "an additional problem is that the angular correlation function ( @xmath45 ) is usually fit as a fixed power - law , which may not correctly represent the data even if it is the only option given the sample sizes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the uncertainties in the correlation function are frequently assumed to be poisson with no correlations between data points ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an incorrect power law , possibly combined with a poor uncertainy model can easily result in incorrect estimates of the spatial correlation length .",
    "a likely consequence of these problems is the broad range of ero clustering estimates that are consistent with their having been the progenitors of anything from local @xmath17 ellipticals to abell type clusters ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for corresponding local galaxy population @xmath9 values , respectively ) .",
    "in this paper we present a comprehensive measurement of ero clustering .",
    "the sample sizes and survey area are large enough to address all these problems .",
    "we consider the largest ero samples to date , selected in either the @xmath46 or irac @xmath13 $ ] bands over @xmath47 or @xmath48 of the noao deep wide field survey ( ndwfs ) botes field @xcite , respectively .",

    "the sample sizes are 5 times larger than any previous study , and 10 times larger than our previous study of eros in botes @xcite .",

    "the @xmath51 m flux limit of mages is consistent with that of luminous infra - red galaxy ( lirg ) emission at @xmath1 @xcite , which sets the minimum star formation rate of at @xmath240 year@xmath63 @xcite for star - forming eros with @xmath13<17.5 $ ] .",
    "these galaxies may be undergoing merger - induced star formation or are early forms of present - day ellipticals with continuing / residual star formation .",
    "the above associations provide a strong indication that the ero population is an earlier form of the elliptical population we observe in the local universe . in general , the @xmath9 values for star - forming and passive eros straddle that of the overall ero population of the same apparent magnitude , with passive eros being more strongly clustered than star - forming eros for a particular magnitude limit .",
    "as galaxies are biased tracers of dark matter , it is possible to get an estimate of their host halo mass through a direct comparison of their clustering with that of dark matter halos .",
    "we determine the clustering of dark matter halos from the non - linear dark matter power spectrum .",
    "the power spectrum of dark matter is generated using the transfer function of @xcite , the halo mass function and bias of @xcite , and the halo model of @xcite .",
    "we assume nfw dark matter halo profiles @xcite with the concentration scalings of @xcite .",
    "we adopt a simple halo occupation scheme assuming one galaxy per halo .",
    "we assume that the eros represent the spatial distribution of their host halos on the scales of @xmath241mpc , and determine their host halo mass by matching the @xmath9 of the eros with that of mass limited dark matter halo samples .",
    "this scheme provides crude estimates of the host halo mass , as it neglects the possibility of ero satellite galaxies , and the correlation function of galaxies is not well described by a power law .",
    "a more accurate treatment may be achieved by halo occupation distribution modeling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we will address in a future paper .",
    "we show the corresponding halo mass estimates for combined ero samples in tables [ resultssum1 ] and [ resultssum3 ] and the separated ero samples in tables [ resultssum2 ] and [ resultssum4 ] .",
    "we find our brightest eros are associated with dark matter halos with masses of the order @xmath242 .",
    "this host halo mass agrees with that predicted from the halo occupation distribution by @xcite .",
    "the faintest eros are associated with dark matter halos of @xmath243 .",
    "these halo masses agree with the ero - local galaxy population associations made using the spatial clustering measurements in the previous section .",
    "we present the most statistically robust measurement of ero clustering to date .",
    "the effects of cosmic variance on our results are modest considering that the integral constraint increases @xmath45 by only @xmath244 due to our large survey area .",
    "our redshift distribution was derived from photometric redshifts , which are constrained with spectroscopy , convolved with their photometric uncertainties , and account for catastrophic @xmath94 outliers , making them reliable representations of @xmath205 .",
    "we find clear trends of decreasing clustering strength with apparent magnitude , which roughly translates to stellar mass since the redshifts are similar .",
    "previous studies have hinted at such a relationship , but the samples were too small to draw solid conclusions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our ero@xmath54 results agree with our previous measurement of ero clustering in a sub - field of the ndwfs @xcite .",
    "we find that our measured ero@xmath54 and ero@xmath55 clustering lengths are typically lower than those of the previous largest area ero studies by @xcite and @xcite , but agree within @xmath159 .",
    "it should be noted that both @xcite and @xcite have likely underestimated their uncertainties , as they are based on poisson uncertainties and assume a diagonal covariance matrix , so the true level of disagreement is smaller .",
    "we tested whether the difference in ero clustering results can be explained by the different criteria used to define ero samples .",
    "we have clearly shown that the various ero criteria select similar but not identical galaxy populations .",
    "differences in number density , @xmath36 and star - forming to passive ero fraction are likely the main causes for differing estimates of @xmath9 between selection criteria .",
    "the results of ero clustering studies using different selection criteria should be directly comparable so long as these factors are considered . for example , ero@xmath55 @xmath131 eros possess slightly stronger clustering properties to ero@xmath54 @xmath131 eros , because the difference in @xmath36 between the samples means that the ero@xmath55 eros are systematically brighter than the ero@xmath54 eros . in the case of ero@xmath56",
    "we found that this criterion selected most of the same galaxies as the ero@xmath54 and ero@xmath55 samples , but also a greater surface density of objects for a comparable magnitude .",
    "the additional objects included a larger fraction of star - forming eros than for the ero@xmath54 and ero@xmath55 samples , and this sample then showed systematically lower clustering for similar magnitude limits .",
    "this means that when you are trying to link eros to local galaxy populations by their clustering , you can not obtain meaningful results unless you separate the passive and star - forming eros into separate samples .",
    "our separation criteria , based on the work of @xcite , shows strong separation in both @xmath10)$ ] and @xmath11-[24])$ ] colors between eros with star formation and those without .",
    "the success of this technique is its ability to pick out pah emission from hot dust at high - redshift and over the redshift range required for ero samples @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11-[8.0])$ ] color is less effective because @xmath150 m is no longer sampling strong pah features at @xmath116 .",
    "likewise the @xmath245 color is not useful for most eros , because it does not bracket or straddle the @xmath43  break until @xmath44 .",
    "deeper @xmath51 m data would allow this technique to be used for fainter samples than analysed in this work .    at fixed apparent magnitude , we find that the two ero sub - populations occupy different environments , with passive eros being more strongly clustered than those with star formation .",
    "the clustering strength for each type - separated ero sample is also a function of apparent magnitude . in many cases ,",
    "passive eros have similar clustering properties to star - forming eros of brighter apparent magnitude .",
    "this is consistent with a duty cycle , whereby star - forming eros turn into passive eros with significantly fainter apparent magnitudes .",
    "the ssfr seems to be lower in dense environments at low redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but some studies suggest that this trend changes at @xmath246 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to @xmath237 ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while we observe that eros without star formation typically occupy denser environments than star - forming eros , we see evidence for star formation in much denser environments than observed at @xmath247",
    "this suggests that a transition between over - densities being dominated by passive galaxies to being dominated by star - forming galaxies could well be occurring at @xmath246 , in agreement with the findings of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "denser environments imply higher mass dark matter halos , and star - forming eros seem to have host halo masses of up to @xmath248 , an order of magnitude greater than the host halo mass of a typical star - forming galaxy at @xmath249 @xcite .",
    "the shifting of the peak in star formation to higher mass halos at @xmath21 is in agreement with the results of previous high - redshift clustering studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". this could be evidence for `` downsizing '' , where the host halo mass and stellar mass of star - forming galaxies decreases with decreasing redshift . since a fixed halo mass at high redshift is more biased with respect to the underlying matter distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and therefore has a greater merger and mass accretion rate than at @xmath247 , this result is not unexpected .",
    "the most significant result of our study is that the passive and star - forming ero sub - populations are two distinct galaxy populations .",
    "separating the ero population into its sub - populations has allowed us to place eros into an evolutionary sequence .",
    "bright passive eros are the likely progenitors of local @xmath14 red galaxies , indicating that massive red galaxies have had their star formation truncated prior @xmath1 .",
    "we were not able to obtain a clustering measurement for the progenitors of central cluster galaxies as such structures are rare , and as a consequence there are too few of these galaxies to measure their clustering .",
    "however , our brightest ero samples certainly hint that the very brightest eros are the likely progenitors of the most massive ellipticals in the local universe .",
    "interestingly , the clustering of star - forming eros connects them as the likely progenitors of local @xmath15 red galaxies .",
    "it may seem peculiar that we detect significant star formation ( @xmath250 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at @xmath1 in progenitors of local @xmath15 ellipticals .",
    "as it is well established that star formation is expected to have ceased in these objects at @xmath251 ( e.g. , gravitational lensing ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , red / elliptical galaxies can be modelled with tau models with e - folding times of @xmath252gyr and formation redshifts of @xmath253 .",
    "it is thus possible to have a galaxy where the bulk of star formation took place at @xmath254 , but at @xmath218 the sfr is still @xmath255 while by @xmath256 the sfr is negligible .",
    "therefore , we find that local red galaxies , down to @xmath17 , in some cases were still building stellar mass via star formation at this epoch .    this work is based in part on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , spitzer / irac and spitzer / mips , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under a contract with nasa .",
