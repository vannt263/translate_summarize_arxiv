    "the two apertures of one of the ends of the magnet are covered by a conventional time projection chamber ( tpc ) @xcite facing  sunset \" axions while in the opposite end , a charge coupled device ( ccd ) @xcite coupled to an x - ray focusing telescope @xcite , and a micromegas detector @xcite search for  sunrise \" axions .",
    "the first results from the 2003 data analysis implied an upper limit to the axion - photon coupling @xmath4 gev@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "a second set of measurements corresponding to 2004 with improved detectors and longer exposure set an upper limit on the axion - photon coupling of @xmath6 at 95@xmath7 cl for axion masses @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "all three detectors use discrimination techniques to reduce background contamination of the expected signal .",
    "the x - ray signal produced by the axions inside the magnet has a maximum at 4kev and vanishes at around 10kev @xcite .",
    "more energetic deposits of energy , or signals outside the detector volume facing the apertures of the magnet , should be rejected .",
    "simple requirements , depending on each detector , eliminate most of the background due to charged particles like cosmic rays , alpha and beta radiation @xcite .    after the use of software cuts , the main source of background",
    "is expected to be gamma rays produced predominantly in the radioactive chains of @xmath9u , @xmath10th and in the @xmath11k isotope decays .",
    "their interactions with material near the detectors can generate low energy photons via the compton effect and also x - rays ( as those from copper identified in experimental spectra @xcite ) .",
    "additional sources are neutrons produced by fission and ( @xmath12,n ) processes or those induced by muons and cosmic rays . as the detector is moving tracking the sun , the background , and its inhomogeneity , is a source of uncertainty since the axion signal is computed as the tracking ( magnet pointing to the sun ) minus the background ( any other magnet orientation ) signal .",
    "therefore , not only low background levels but also a certain independence of the position are desirable to reduce uncertainties . the shielding presented here has been built for the tpc with this aim . in this article",
    "we will study the effects of the complete shielding installed in 2004 , comparing its performance to the copper box used as shielding during the 2003 data taking period .",
    "for these studies , the energy range 37kev has been chosen as the control region to analyse in order to be sure to eliminate threshold or saturation effects .",
    "preliminary results were presented in @xcite .    in the first section",

    "two @xmath16 diameter windows , consisting of very thin mylar foils ( 3 or @xmath17 ) stretched on a metallic strongback , allow the x - rays coming from the magnet to enter the chamber @xcite . except for the electrodes , the screws , the printed circuit board ( pcb ) and the windows , the entire chamber is made of 1.7 cm thick low radioactivity plexiglass .    a shielding around the tpc",
    "was designed to reduce the background in a complementary way to the effect of the off - line software cuts @xcite .",
    "the requirements were to get a certain reduction of the background levels coming from external sources and a decrease of the background spatial inhomogeneity observed in the experimental site .",
    "the final design has been the result of a compromise among the shielding effect and technical limitations such as weight and size restrictions imposed by the experimental moving structure .",

    "the described scheme is the outcome of several simulations and experimental tests . during the 2003 data taking period , the detector set - up consisted just of a copper box with n@xmath22 gas flush .",
    "the full shielding was installed in 2004 , after a test carried out in the real experimental conditions .",

    "we should also add around 6 photons @xmath35 coming from the soil .",
    "these data pointed also to a radon emanation for the east and south walls .",
    "later radon measurements @xcite gave mean values of @xmath36 in summer and @xmath37 in winter , not incompatible with a certain dependence on temperature .    within this category",
    ", we could also include gammas arriving from radioactive contamination in the magnet platform , electronics material and also the contribution of the detector itself .",
    "most of these materials are steel , plastics and metals ( i.e. fe , c , h , cu , ... ) whose impurities are also uranium , thorium and potassium .",
    "neutrons and protons coming from cosmic rays can also induce radioisotopes in the detector gas and materials ( mainly @xmath38c and @xmath39h ) whose contribution can be neglected owing to their low production rate ( 0.003 nuclei of @xmath38c and 0.001 nuclei of @xmath39h per litre and day in argon , computed considering saturation with a modified version of the cosmo @xcite code based on the semiempirical formulas of silberberg and tsao @xcite ) .",
    "another gamma contribution corresponds to the cosmic ray photon flux , being only a small fraction ( @xmath40 ) of the total @xcite .    summarizing , the experimental site contributes to an important , and non - uniform , gamma background owing to radioactive contamination .",
    "most of the gamma radiation described above would traverse the active volume of the detector without interacting at all due to the special features of the detector ( only sensitive to energies of a few kev ) .",
    "however , energetic gamma background loses part of its energy after interactions with materials surrounding the detector creating secondary photons which do contribute significantly to the background signal .",
    "therefore , any shielding designed for the tpc detector should be a compromise between the external flux reduction and the increase of interactions in these materials as well as their own radioactive contamination .",
    "the best control of all these variables is achieved after monte carlo simulations plus experimental tests .",
    "even if the neutron component of the background is below the level of the typical gamma background by three or four orders of magnitude , neutron signals in the detector could mimic those from x - rays .",
    "quantitative measurements of neutron background have been performed in the experimental site with a bf@xmath41 detector .",
    "the homogeneous measured flux of neutrons in the cast site is around @xmath42 .",
    "this value , and its homogeneity , points to a cosmic source .",
    "cosmic ray generated neutrons have energies below a few gev and the spectrum shows a dependence as 1/e@xmath43 up to 50mev and as 1/e above this energy @xcite .",
    "this is the most important neutron contribution , not only for its intensity but also for its high energy .",
    "other sources of neutron background are neutrons induced by muons in the surrounding materials , @xmath44 reactions on light elements and the spontaneous fission .",
    "muons interacting in shielding materials produce neutrons .",
    "fluka @xcite simulations with a measured total muon flux of @xmath0 @xmath45 gave us a yield for neutrons entering the detector of @xmath46 and a neutron spectrum peaking below 1mev .",
    "most of these events are rejected by anti - coincidence with the veto installed as part of the shielding .    in nature",
    "mainly three nuclides ( @xmath9u , @xmath24u and @xmath10th ) undergo spontaneous fission .",
    "the rate of spontaneous fission of @xmath9u , the nuclide of shorter half life , is 0.218/year / g of concrete for 1ppm of @xmath9u and the average number of neutrons emitted per fission event is @xmath47 with a typical evaporation spectrum peaking at around 1mev .",
    "most of these fission neutrons will come from the concrete walls . assuming a penetration for neutrons of 10 cm",
    ", we estimate the volume and surface production of neutrons in the concrete walls from around 0.60@xmath48 for the lower east wall and @xmath49 for the metal pillars to 30 @xmath50 in the upper east and south walls .",
    "the @xmath12 particles emitted in the radioactive chains can interact with other elements and produce neutrons through @xmath44 reactions . for the upper south and east walls",
    "the final estimated neutron yield , following @xcite , is @xmath51 .",
    "the radioactive activity of soil ( or of the lower east wall ) will produce one order of magnitude less of neutrons @xmath52 .",

    "a complete set of monte carlo simulations has been carried out in order to estimate the external background contribution to the tpc detector data during the 2003 and 2004 taking data periods .",
    "we have not only reproduced the tpc detector and its shielding in the simulations , but also the main software cuts to be able to discriminate the expected x - ray signal .",
    "they show that the use of cuts reduce the registered events by two orders of magnitude in good agreement with the experimental data . this fact results in low statistics , having to establish a compromise between computing time and non - negligible statistical errors . despite this ,",
    "monte carlo simulations have been very useful to understand and quantify the number of counts coming from the external background in the 2003 and 2004 sets of data of the tpc detector .    the background level ( in the 37kev region of interest ) for three different shielding configurations",
    "have been compared : a 5mm - thick copper box , the copper box plus 2.5 cm of lead , and a complete shielding consisting of 5mm - thick copper box plus 2.5 cm of lead plus 22.5 cm of polyethylene .",
    "first of all we will focus on gamma simulations since this is the main contribution to the tpc background , then we will make a few comments about neutron simulations , though they are quite difficult to verify experimentally .",
    "these simulations have been performed using the geant4 code @xcite since it allows to take into account all the aspects of the simulation process including the detector response .",
    "the primary events , corresponding to the radioactive chains and potassium , have been generated uniformly and isotropically on a sphere surrounding the most external surface of the shielding .",
    "the shielding made of 5 mm of copper plus 2.5 cm of lead plus 22.5 cm of polyethylene reduces the external gamma background by more than one order of magnitude , ( 92@xmath313)@xmath7 in the 37kev range .",
    "since the thick layer of polyethylene helps in the gamma attenuation , the same shielding without polyethylene is about a 15@xmath7 less effective , causing an estimated reduction of ( 77@xmath314)@xmath7 .",
    "compton interactions in the polyethylene result in lower energy photons which are easily absorbed in the lead .",
    "though a thicker layer of lead could stop a larger fraction of the external gammas , it can be a source of secondary neutrons and it would add too much weight to one of the ends of the magnet .",
    "due to the spatial inhomogeneity of the gamma background coming from walls , simulations allow us to make just a rough estimate of the tpc recorded counts .",
    "these external photons cause between 30 and 55 counts per hour in the volume of the detector facing the two windows for the 37kev energy region in the case of the copper shielding ( 2003 data ) , and between 2 and 5 counts per hour in the case of the complete shielding configuration of 2004 .",
    "this result , as we will see in next section , is compatible with measured data .",
    "the geant4 package has also been used to simulate the effect of the radon trapped inside the copper box .",
    "radon decays have been produced isotropically in the volume between the tpc and the copper box .",
    "these simulations quantify the point - like signals in the 37kev range in 0.04 counts per hour for an overestimated radon concentration of 25bq / m@xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the radon contribution to the background can be neglected in the 2003 and 2004 shielding conditions due to the plastic bag around the entire set - up and the nitrogen flush .",
    "though neutrons interacting in materials can produce @xmath57 particles , more neutrons , @xmath12 particles and fission fragments depending on materials and energies , the most efficient reaction is the elastic scattering , energy transferred to nuclear recoils .",
    "this energy is determined by the energy of the neutron incident ( @xmath58 ) and the scattering angle @xmath59 @xmath60 in the case of argon , @xmath61 , assuming a quenching factor of 0.28 , the maximum visible energy and the neutron energy are related as follows @xmath62 therefore , the neutrons able to deposit a visible energy in the analysed range of 37 kev are mostly those with an energy between 0.11 and 0.27 mev .",
    "a geant4 simulation , using g4ndl3.5 high precision neutron data library and a real cosmic spectrum as input , has been carried out .",
    "this simulation has allowed us to roughly estimate about 2 counts per hour caused by cosmic neutrons inside the two windows of the tpc in the ( 37)kev visible energy region in the case of the copper shielding .",
    "as we will show in section  [ sec : tpc - measurements ] , this rate is between 25 - 45 times smaller than the counting rates in 2003 .",
    "to understand the effects of the different layers of shielding we have used the fluka code of proven reliability for the transport of neutrons .",
    "this second simulation shows the effects of every layer of shielding material on cosmic neutrons : while polyethylene decreases the number of background neutrons per cosmic neutron , the 2.5 cm of lead increases this number ( see figure  [ cfneutrons ] ) due to @xmath63 processes ( observe the evaporation spectrum ) .",
    "cadmium absorbs thermal and epithermal neutrons with energies below 1kev .",
    "the shielding without polyethylene has been also compared to the complete configuration .",
    "the number of cosmic neutrons able to produce nuclear recoils and a deposit of visible energy in the tpc in the 37kev range decreases by only 20@xmath7 after the complete shielding due to the production of neutrons in lead .",
    "the number of neutrons could even increase by 10@xmath7 if the 22.5 cm of polyethylene are taken off .",
    "then , the shielding hardly reduces the amount of neutrons and it would increase the number without polyethylene .",
    "this background contribution has been estimated in around 1.5 counts per hour for the 2004 shielding conditions .",
    "the neutron production in the shielding due to muons has also been investigated .",
    "most of these neutrons are produced in lead .",
    "as mentioned in subsection  [ subsec : neutrons ] , the number of neutrons produced by each sea level muon is 0.024 , giving a neutron flux reaching the detector of 1.2@xmath64 per @xmath35 , six orders of magnitude higher that the calculated in @xcite for a thicker shielding but a much less intense underground muon flux .",
    "we can roughly estimate about 0.02 the counts per hour inside the windows corresponding to neutrons induced by muons , three orders of magnitude smaller than the measured background rates .",
    "regarding other population of neutrons , we have not considered those coming from radioactivity ( fission and ( @xmath12 , n ) processes ) since 22.5 cm of moderator would reduce their tiny contribution ( of the order of @xmath65 ) by two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "first tests of the full shielding ( with a 5-cm - thick layer of lead in this case ) at the laboratory showed a reduction factor of @xmath66 below the background level of the chamber , without any shielding or nitrogen flush , for energies between 1 and 10kev .",
    "once the detector was mounted in the magnet on the moving platform , this factor became @xmath67 ( @xmath68 in the 6 - 10kev range ) .",
    "after these first tests , another set was undertaken at the cast experimental site to observe the effects of every component of the shielding .",
    "the magnet was placed in horizontal position facing the ne corner , far away from the forced air windows and in an intermediate position between the north and the east wall in order to get a more _ average _ flux .",
    "here we measured the tpc background in different shielding conditions .",
    "for this position , it has been checked that the full shielding ( copper plus lead plus polyethylene ) reduces background levels by a factor of @xmath03 in the 37 kev energy interval , in comparison to the copper shielding , thanks mainly to the 2.5 cm of lead , while a double layer of lead ( 5 cm ) does not improve these results ( see figure  [ test ] ) . when comparing the experimental reduction factor from those obtained in simulations , it must be kept in mind that in the latter we were just dealing with external gamma radiation , forgetting about internal contamination or radon intrusion which contribute to measurements in all shielding conditions .",
    "other reason for the discrepancies lies in the fact that in simulations the shielding is all around the detector while the tpc is actually attached to the magnet pipes , and thus partially not shielded from it . as a consequence of these two reasons ,",
    "the background level decrease is lower than expected after simulations .",
    "other experimental test was performed to quantify the contribution of the radon trapped in the copper box .",
    "measurements were carried out with and without nitrogen flush at the same spatial position and one right after the other to avoid time variations . the subtracted spectrum ( without and with nitrogen flush )",
    "can be thought as due to the radon inside the copper box since the plastic bag prevents the outer radon from entering the shielding . despite the poor statistics , the estimated radon rate in the 37kev range for point - like signals ( 0.13@xmath31 2.33 counts per hour ) in the volume facing the two windows of the tpc , shows a negligible contribution to the background and is compatible with the 0.04 counts estimated in simulations .",
    "finally , we can also compare the experimental background data , since during the two data taking periods ( years 2003 and 2004 ) the tpc detector has recorded not only tracking data , when the opposite part of the magnet is pointing to the sun , but also background data at any other time of the day . in order to get the best control of the background and determine its inhomogeneity , these measurements have been performed at precise horizontal ( movement along a circle ) and vertical positions .",
    "the figure [ fondos ] shows measured background levels for nine positions : the three first measurement points are facing the north wall ; the three next points face the ne corner and the last one faces the east wall near one of the metal pillars . during the year 2003 , with the tpc covered by a 5 mm thick copper box and a nitrogen flush inside , the background measurements showed a high degree of inhomogeneity as it can be observed .",
    "higher background rates are registered in the proximity of more intense sources of radioactivity such as the upper part of the east wall or the soil while the closeness to a metal pillar or to the plastic wall ( upper part of north wall ) , decreases rates .",
    "also metal components as scaffolding , ladders , ... can affect measurements at some points .",
    "thanks to the shielding described in section  [ sec : tpc ] , the 2004 background data show rate reductions by more than a factor of 2.5 , reaching even a factor of 4 at some positions ( see figure  [ fondos ] ) . moreover ,",
    "the background is now fairly homogeneous .    when comparing these experimental data with the results of the simulations presented in the previous section , one notes than the background reduction obtained with the shielding is larger in the external gamma simulations ( a reduction factor of 10  15 ) than in the experimental data ( 2.5  4 ) .",
    "this seems to imply that , while most of the background in the 2003 setup was indeed linked to the external gamma background ( as proved by its inhomogeneity and the effectiveness of the shielding ) , most of there remaining background in the 2004 setup must be however of a distinct origin that those included in the simulations .",
    "the most probable candidates are internal contaminations of the components inside the shielding , or background coming from the side where the detector is attached to the magnet ( and necessarily unshielded ) , from contaminations present for instance in the magnet components .",
    "this hypothesis fits well with the fact that this contribution in constant for every magnet position .",
    "as shown in table [ btable ] , where all calculated and measured background levels are collected , a speculated constant internal contamination ( first column ) of about 15 counts per hour would fit the overall scenario .",
    "whatever the precise origin of the remaining background , the effect of the shielding on the 2005 tpc operation , both in terms of reduction of background and its variability , yielded a substantial increase of sensitivity of the detector in the context of the cast experiment @xcite , when compared to the previous 2003 period",

    "gamma measurements have reported a clear inhomogeneus radioactive contamination due to the uranium and thorium radioactive chains and to potassium and radon emanation from the east and south wall . also neutrons have been studied , being the cosmic neutrons the most relevant contribution .",
    "other background contaminants can be neglected .",
    "then , after the identification of the background sources , we have undertaken monte carlo simulations which have allowed us to understand the tpc detector response to gamma and neutron sources as well as the effects of different components of shielding on the background levels . as a result of these simulations",
    ", we have learned that 2.5 cm of lead reduces the external gamma background in the 37kev range by @xmath70 but produces neutrons due to high energy cosmic neutron and muon interactions .",
    "the addition of a 22.5 cm layer of polyethylene results in a @xmath71 reduction of the gamma background , decreases by @xmath72 the cosmic neutrons and eliminates any low energy neutrons .",
    "these results are compatible with experimental tests performed in the cast site . for all these reasons",
    "the installed shielding in 2004 consists of 5 mm of copper plus 2.5 cm of lead plus 22.5 cm of polyethylene .",
    "finally , the 2004 data confirm a reduction of background levels by a factor between 2.5 and 4 from the 2003 data ( the highest for positions close to the most intense gamma sources ) as well as a quite acceptable degree of homogeneity .",
    "for this period , most of the contamination is due to sources near the detector ( around 15 counts per hour in the volume facing the two windows for the 37kev energy interval ) , while external gamma radiation and cosmic neutrons only add 3 - 6 counts per hour to the tpc detector background for the same interval of energies .",
