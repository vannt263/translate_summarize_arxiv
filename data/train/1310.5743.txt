    "the `` statistical curse of the second half rank '' problem @xcite stems from real life considerations leading to rather complex combinatorics .",
    "one is primarly concerned with rank expectations in sailing boats regattas , bearing in mind that the issue discussed here is quite general and can apply to rank expectations of students taking exams , or other types of similar endeavors as well .",
    "consider as a typical example the _ spi ouest - france _ regatta which takes place each year during 4 days at easter in la trinit - sur - mer , brittany ( france ) .",
    "it involves a `` large '' number @xmath0 of identical boats , say @xmath1 , running a `` large '' number @xmath2 of races , say @xmath3 ( that is to say @xmath4 races per day , weather permitting , see fig .  1 ) . in each race",
    "each boat gets a rank @xmath5 with the condition that there are no ex aequo . once the last race is over , to determine the final rank of a boat and thus the winner of the regatta one proceeds as follows :                    what is the `` statistical curse of the second half rank '' ? in the _ spi ouest - france _ 2009 results sheet ( see fig .",
    "2 for boats with final rank between @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , consider for example the boat with final rank @xmath20 : its ranks in the @xmath21 races are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath23 , @xmath28 , @xmath25 , @xmath29 so that its score is @xmath30 .",
    "the crew of this boat might naively expect that since its mean rank is @xmath31 and so it has been on average ranked @xmath18 , its final rank should be around @xmath18 .",
    "no way , the boat ends is in parenthesis : this is because each boat s worst rank is removed from the final counting .",
    "it is as if they were only @xmath32 races with , for the boat considered here , ranks @xmath33 , `` improved '' score @xmath34 and mean rank @xmath35 .",
    "so , on average , the boat is ranked @xmath36 even though it ends up being @xmath20 . ] up being @xmath20 .",
    "this `` curse '' phenomenon is quite general and one would like to understand its origin and be able to evaluate it .",
    "a qualitative explanation is simple @xcite : in a given race given the rank of the boat considered above , assume that the ranks of the other boats are random variables with a uniform distribution .",
    "the random rank assumption is good if , bearing in mind that all boats are identical , the crews can also be considered as more or less equally worthy , which for sure is partially the case .",
    "since there are no ex aequo it means that the ranks of the other boats , in the first race , are a random permutation of @xmath37 , in the second race , a random permutation of @xmath38 , etc .",
    "each race is obviously independent from the others , so that the scores are the sums of @xmath21 independent random variables .",
    "but @xmath21 is already a large number in probability calculus so that the central limit theorem applies .",
    "it follows that the scores are random variables with a gaussian probability density centered around the middle score @xmath39 .",
    "a gaussian distribution implies a lot of boats with scores packed around the middle score .",
    "since the score @xmath40 of the boat considered here is larger than the middle score @xmath41 , this packing implies that its final rank is pushed upward from its mean rank : * this is the statistical `` curse''*. on the contrary if the boat s score had been lower than the middle score , its final rank would have been pushed downward from its mean rank : * its crew would have enjoyed a statistical `` blessing''*.    let us rewrite things more precisely by asking , given the score @xmath7 of the boat considered among the @xmath0 boats , what is the probability distribution @xmath42 for its final rank to be @xmath43 $ ] ?",
    "a complication arises as soon as @xmath44 : @xmath42 does not only depend on the score @xmath7 but also on the ranks of the boat in each race .",
    "for example for @xmath45 , take @xmath46 and the score @xmath47 , it is easy to check by complete enumeration that @xmath48 .",
    "the distributions are of course similar but slightly differ . to avoid this complication",
    "let us from now on consider @xmath0 boats with in each race random ranks given by a random permutation of @xmath49 @xmath50 an additional `` virtual '' boat only specified by its score @xmath7 and ask the question again : given the score @xmath7 of this virtual boat what is the probability distribution @xmath42 for its final rank to be @xmath51 $ ] ?",
    "this problem is almost the same - race case it is in fact the same problem . ] yet a little bit simpler since , by construction , it does not have the complication discussed above .    in a given race @xmath52",
    "call @xmath53 the rank of the boat @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "there are no ex aequo in a given race : the @xmath53 s are a random permutation of @xmath49 so that they are correlated random variables with          now , the score @xmath60 of boat @xmath61 is defined as @xmath62 , the middle score being @xmath63 . in the large @xmath2 limit",
    "the central limit theorem applies -here for correlated random variables- to yield the scores joint density probability distribution        now consider the virtual boat with score @xmath67 : @xmath42 is the probability for @xmath68 boats among the @xmath0 s to have a score @xmath69 and for the other @xmath70 boats to have a score @xmath71 @xmath72    let us take the large number of boats limit : a saddle point approximation finally @xcite gives @xmath73 as the cumulative probability distribution of a normal variable @xmath74 dn\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76 . in fig .  3 a plot of @xmath77",
    "is displayed in the case @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "the curse and blessing effects are clearly visible on the sharp increase around the middle score -a naive expectation would claim a linear increase .",
    "@xmath80 dn\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\lambda } } \\int_{-\\infty}^{-\\bar{n}_{t } } \\exp\\left [ -\\frac{n^2}{2\\lambda } \\right ] dn -{1\\over { 2\\pi}}\\exp\\left[-{\\bar{n}_{t}^2\\over \\lambda}\\right]\\ ] ] where a damping due to the correlations is clearly visible .",
    "so far we have dealt with the `` curse '' which is a large number of races and boats effect .",
    "let us now turn to the combinatorics of a small number of races @xmath81 for a given number of boats @xmath82 .",
    "the simplest situation is the @xmath83-race case @xmath84 which happens to be solvable -it can be viewed as a solvable `` @xmath83-body '' problem- with an exact solution for @xmath42 . to obtain in this simple situation the probability distribution one proceeds as follows ( see fig .",
    "4 ) :    \\1 ) one represents the possible ranks configurations of any boat among the @xmath0 s in the two races by points on a @xmath85 square lattice ( in the @xmath86-race case one would have a cubic lattice , etc ) : since there are no ex aequo there is exactly @xmath87 point per line and per column , so there are @xmath88 such configurations ( in the @xmath2 races case one would have @xmath89 such configurations )                let us tabulate @xmath98 , with @xmath51 $ ] , for @xmath99 : @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106 the numbers between brackets happen to be known as the @xmath107 numbers with @xmath108 $ ] ( here one has dropped the trivial @xmath109 s obtained for @xmath110 i.e. @xmath111 ) .",
    "an eulerian number ( see fig .",
    "5 ) is the number of permutations of the numbers 1 to n in which exactly m elements are greater than the previous element ( permutations with m `` ascents '' ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "it is not difficult to realize that all the information in @xmath42 is contained in @xmath116 that is to say in the generating function @xmath117 .",
    "rephrased more precisely , @xmath118 for @xmath82 is generated by @xmath119 with the @xmath120 exponent being the number of boats @xmath0 and , for a given @xmath0 , the @xmath121 exponent being the rank @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "similarly @xmath122 for @xmath123 is generated by      why eulerian numbers should play a role here can be explained from scratch by a simple combinatorial argument : let us use the notations that the boat which came up @xmath129 in the first race had rank @xmath130 in the second race : @xmath131 is a random permutation of @xmath132 . in the case of interest where the score of the virtual boat is the middle score @xmath133 ,",
    "the boat that came @xmath129 in the first race beats the virtual boat if @xmath134 , that is to say if it is better than @xmath129 , counting from the bottom , in the second race .",
    "therefore , the counting problem of @xmath118 is equivalent to counting so - called excedances : an excedance in a permutation @xmath131 is an element such that @xmath135 .",
    "the number of permutations with precisely @xmath90 excedances is known to be an eulerian number ( thus excedances are what is called an eulerian statistic , see for example @xcite p.  23 ) . as",
    "an illustration look at the case @xmath46 : the six permutations of @xmath136 are @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 .",
    "the numbers of excedances ( here defined as @xmath134 ) are respectively @xmath142 which indeed yields the @xmath143 numbers @xmath144 for @xmath145 ( @xmath87 permutation with 0 excedance , @xmath146 permutations with @xmath87 excedance , @xmath87 permutation with @xmath83 excedances ) appearing in @xmath116 , @xmath51 $ ] , @xmath46 .",
    "there is still an other way to look at the problem in terms of stirling numbers of the second kind , here defined as @xmath147 stirling numbers count in how many ways the numbers @xmath148 can be partitioned in @xmath61 groups : for example for @xmath149                      @xmath157 the probability distribution @xmath42 can indeed be rewritten @xcite as @xmath158 why stirling numbers should play a role here arises @xcite from graph counting considerations on the @xmath85 lattice when one now includes all the points below the diagonal .",
    "as an example let us still consider the case @xmath149 : below the diagonal @xmath149 they are @xmath159 points @xmath160 labelled by their lattice coordinates @xmath161 .",
    "one draws a graph according to the no ex aequo exclusion rule : starting say from the point @xmath162 one links it to another point if it obeys the no ex aequo exclusion rule with respect to @xmath162 , that is to say if its coordinates are not @xmath163 . in our example",
    "there is only one such point @xmath164",
    ". then one can link the point @xmath164 to the points @xmath165 and @xmath166 , which can also be linked together .",
    "finally one can link @xmath165 to @xmath167 and @xmath166 to @xmath168 with also a link between @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "the numbers @xmath169 count in the graph just obtained the number of subgraphs with either @xmath170 point ( this is the number of points @xmath159 ) , @xmath171 points linked ( there are 7 such cases ) , @xmath172 points fully linked ( there is 1 such case ) , @xmath173 points fully linked ( there is no such case ) , @xmath128 , a counting which finally gives the stirling - like numbers @xmath174 where the @xmath87 on the left is by convention the number of subgraphs with @xmath175 point .",
    "it still remains to be shown why this subgraph counting is indeed equivalent to the stirling counting . to do this one",
    "has simply to notice that the former is encapsulated in a recurrence relation obtained by partitioning the @xmath176 lattice counting as :            it follows that the numbers @xmath180 have to obey the recurrence relation @xmath181 valid for @xmath182 $ ] , bearing in mind that when @xmath183 trivially @xmath184 . but this recurrence relation can be mapped on a more standard recurrence relation for the stirling numbers of the second kind : if one sets @xmath185 $ ] and defines now @xmath186 one obtains for the @xmath187 s @xmath188 which via @xmath189 $ ] rewrites as @xmath190 that is to say finally @xmath191    this therefore establishes that the @xmath187 s , i.e. the @xmath192 s , are indeed stirling numbers of the second kind .",
    "this is of course not a surprise that both eulerian and stirling numbers do play a role since there is a correspondance between them @xmath193 with @xmath194 $ ] .",
    "why does one rewrite @xmath42 in terms of stirling numbers in the 2-race case ?",
    "because this rewriting can be generalized @xcite to the @xmath2-race case .",
    "the generalisation is formal since one does not know what the @xmath2-dependant `` generalized stirling '' numbers which control the probability distribution one has a cubic lattice .",
    "the corresponding graph structure becomes more an more involved , and so the counting of the associated fully connected subgraphs . ] are .",
    "again this is like moving from a solvable `` @xmath83-body '' problem to a so far non solvable `` @xmath2-body '' problem .",
    "still it remains quite fascinating that well - known numbers in combinatorics , such as eulerian and stirling numbers , should be at the heart of the understanding of rank expectations in regattas , at least in the 2-race case .",
    "* acknowledgements : * i would like to take the occasion of leonid pastur @xmath195 birthday celebration to tell him all my friendship and admiration .",
    "i acknowledge useful conversations with s. wagner .",
    "my thanks also to dhriti bhatt s youthful energy and her willingness to look at this problem again in the summer 2012 ."
