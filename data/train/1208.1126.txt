    "a mass hanging from a spring is a common , easy - to - perform experiment often used to introduce first - year physics students to simply harmonic motion.@xcite although the apparatus is simple and inexpensive , under certain conditions it turns out that the motion is not simple at all.@xcite gravitational ( pendulum ) , elastic ( spring ) , and torsional forces @xcite generate numerous , complex phenomena that result in surprising motions in the spring - mass system .",
    "these phenomena include multimode operation ( many oscillating modes can be simultaneously active),@xcite parametric instability ( oscillation instabilities when the system is driven at certain frequencies ) , and energy transfer between the spring - bouncing mode and the pendulum - swinging mode .",
    "a real spring - mass system behaves as a simple harmonic oscillator only under specific conditions : ( i ) the spring s mass must be negligible compared to the attached mass ; ( ii ) the frequency of elastic oscillation must not resonate with the frequency of pendular swinging ; and ( iii ) initial spring stretch must be strictly vertical .    a spring - mass system assembled with different values for mass and for spring constant can occasionally fall into a configuration where its elastic oscillation frequency @xmath0 and its pendulum - oscillation frequency @xmath1 have a ratio of nearly two . in such cases ,",

    "this periodic action results in an exchange of energy and much more complex motion .",
    "the vertical oscillation amplitude decreases while the pendular amplitude increases , and vice - versa .",
    "we noticed that an interaction between vertical and pendular oscillations sometimes occurred in our laboratory when students are free to choose the springs and masses themselves .",
    "the physical aspects of the configurations that are linked to parametric behavior required further research to understand .",
    "thus , we performed a study of motion waveforms for a variety of frequency ratios that spanned the resonance value @xmath2 .",
    "the frequency ratio is selected at will according to the equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the spring constant , @xmath5 is the appended mass , @xmath6 is the gravitational field strength , and @xmath7 is the equilibrium length of the vertical oscillating spring , @xmath8 being the natural ( unstretched ) spring length .    in order to perform this experiment",
    ", students must deal with the gap between theory and practice , examine complex , multi - effect motion , and master experimental techniques .",
    "moreover , they have to treat data statistically and purge the experiment of many `` nuisances . '' in other words , the students are forced to develop the ability to manage unexpected experimental observations .",
    "the complexity of a phenomenon that is not fully understood requires a strategy for singling out the motion components , relaxing their interrelations so as to treat each component separately .",
    "afterwards , these components can be combined to understand the complete motion . in short ,",
    "this experiment turns out to be a useful , guided - research activity for students .",
    "the theoretical work starts with the idealized equation of motion for the deviation @xmath9 from the ( vertical ) equilibrium position for a mass on a spring @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a damping coefficient .",
    "the experimental goal is to test the solution @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the initial oscillation amplitude , @xmath14 is the damping constant , and @xmath15 in these equations , the mass of the spring is assumed to be zero , which is not actually the case . the damping force is assumed to be proportional to velocity , although air friction against a moving object depends on its shape and is not ( generally ) linear with velocity .",
    "the investigation proceeds through the following steps : ( a ) test of hooke s law @xmath16 , ( b ) test of @xmath17 , ( c ) measurement of the damping time @xmath18 , and ( d ) test of the sinusoidal solution eq .",

    "this study is meant to provide a deeper grounding for those conducting a widely used experiment ; it is also a possible topic for open - ended investigation or small , individual research projects .",
    "complete investigation of the spring - mass system also requires studying forced oscillations,@xcite which is to be the subject of further research .",
    "experiment layout . a meterstick and a light projector are used for measuring spring extension , while motion detectors ( sonars ) detect the motion .",

    "the @xmath20- and @xmath21-coordinates of the hanging mass , defined in relation to its equilibrium position , are tracked by the bottom ( sonar1 ) and lateral ( sonar2 ) ultrasonic motion detectors , respectively .",
    "the system is surrounded by plastic foam to absorb the direct sonar waves not reflected by the mass - bob .",
    "the latter is a pile of 20 g metal disks on a support , to which plasticine may be added to obtain the desired precise weight . the support is terminated by a diskette of 70-mm diameter to reflect the sound waves emitted by the bottom sonar as much as possible .",
    "this technique is necessary because the mass has wide lateral oscillations and wobbles around its pivot .",
    "another spurious motion can be observed , namely : transverse spring vibration , possibly due to the mass wobbling .",
    "the value of the diskette diameter is a compromise between a larger size for ideal sonar detection and a smaller size in order to minimize both friction and spurious motion .",

    "[ marcostellatofig02 ] .",
    "similarly , sonar2 , meant to detect the transverse motion , also detects vertical spring oscillation .",
    "this leads to waveforms in which an oscillation with smaller amplitude is superimposed on the main oscillation .",
    "the resulting distortion of the oscillation under study can be observed by restricting the oscillations to pure motions . for pendulum motion ,",
    "the spring was replaced with a wire ; for vertical motion , a thin metal stick was inserted along the spring axis .",
    "the observation of pure motions is useful as a basis to interpret the results of combined oscillations described in the following sections .",
    "it is worth mentioning that vertical motion detection by sonar1 is not affected by the rotation of the pendular oscillation plane , but this is not true with sonar2 .",
    "when the oscillation plane rotates by large angles , sonar2 waveforms become almost useless .",
    "good waveforms from sonar1 are enough to study the motion , with the occasional help of some information from sonar2 .    a meterstick and a stopwatch are used to measure elongations and oscillation periods , respectively .",

    "this paper consists mainly of research performed after the students had completed the lab , and was carried out to investigate their unexpected results .",
    "in our simple harmonic motion experiment , students determine the spring constant in the traditional way .",
    "a test of hooke s law @xmath16 is performed by adding different masses to the spring and measuring the relative static elongations using a meterstick .",
    "the spring constant is obtained with a precision of a few percent .",

    "some oscillations turn out to be very irregular , particularly when smaller masses are used .",
    "hence , students are guided towards using a larger mass to obtain more regular oscillations .",
    "the oscillation period is measured using a stopwatch .",
    "the initial objective was to verify @xmath25 , rewritten in terms of the period @xmath26 as @xmath27 a graph of the added mass versus @xmath28 shows the expected straight line with a small negative intercept on the @xmath29-axis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ marcostellatofig03 ] .",
    "this test shows the effect of the non - negligible mass of the spring .",
    "a class discussion of the situation @xcite leads to the conclusion that the spring s mass can not be neglected , and that the added mass should be replaced by an effective mass that can be written @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the effective contribution of the spring s mass .",

    "while students notice that lighter masses cause more complex oscillations , they also realize that the system does not show the expected simple harmonic oscillation and ask assistants for help .",
    "the new phenomenon of parametric oscillations comes to the fore for the first time in this context , and the complexity of the movement leads to further measurements with multiple motion detectors connected to a computer .",

    "is measured using a stopwatch .",
    "students use larger masses to get reasonably stable oscillations .",
    "they observe that @xmath35 depends on initial oscillation amplitude and on the value of the added mass ( as expected from the definition @xmath36 ) .    at this point , the study of the motion using waveforms is introduced , with the aim of measuring the two parameters @xmath35 and @xmath37 directly from the computer screen to check their previously obtained results . in theory , the value of decay time is constant for a given mass ; nevertheless , we measure it for different sections of the same decay curve obtaining different values . indeed",
    ", the decay does not appear to be exponential towards the end of the curve , instead showing decay times that increase with time .",
    "the very slow decay at the tail indicates an effective reduction of the damping coefficient ; that is , a reduction of the effect of air resistance when the mass oscillates more slowly . as a result , the mathematical form of eq .",
    "( [ z(t)-freemotion ] ) , based on a constant decay value , does not reproduce actual , observed motion .",
    "initial fast decay indicates the possibility of energy transfer from the vertical motion to other motions . for the sake of thoroughness , we add that the assumed linear dependence of the damping time @xmath35 on the hanging mass ( @xmath36 ) was tested , with better than 80  percent agreement .",
    "@xcite    after recording the variation in decay time along the waveform curves on the screen , students use the same graphs to measure oscillation frequency .",
    "they determine the time interval relative to a set of oscillations on the computer screen , then use a fast fourier transform ( fft ) tool , part of their data acquisition software , which provides the frequency spectrum . in this context , students are introduced to the concept and use of the fft tool .",
    "after this measurement , students take a look at the waveforms obtained with different masses . the seemingly harmonic behavior with heavy masses , the very complex motion with elastic vertical and transverse pendular oscillation interchange , and the strong variation of waveform decay at the beginning of the motion make it clear that a new and more complete model for the system is needed to account for the many discrepancies between the simple motion predicted by the theory of harmonic oscillation and actual experimental observations at variance with expected results .    separately",
    ", a few highly - motivated students then further studied the discrepancy between theory and experiment by fitting the experimental waveform to the function @xmath38 .",
    "the values of @xmath39 , @xmath35 , and @xmath40 ( initial amplitude , decay time , and oscillation frequency , respectively ) are extracted from the waveform as explained above .",
    "fitting the whole waveform turned out to be impossible ; reasonably good fits were obtained only within sections of the decaying waveform .",

    "typical waveforms obtained with a set of 70 g , 60 g , 50 g , and 40 g masses are shown in fig .  [ marcostellatofig04 ] .",
    "waveforms from heavier to lighter masses show a transition from an exponential decaying sinewave to partially modulated decaying sinewaves and , finally , to a multi - lobed , completely modulated sinewave .",
    "the same developments are observed when looking directly at the motion , with composite vertical - pendular motion for masses of intermediate value and the addition of frequent switches between vertical and pendular oscillations with the lightest mass .",
    "the intermediate case of a modulated - edge sinewave indicates that oscillation exchange between the two modes is partial . by counting the lobes",
    ", we can measure the frequency of oscillation - mode exchange .",
    "another interesting observation is that the plane of pendular oscillation is not stable .",
    "it rotates by a few degrees in the case of low partial mode exchange .",
    "conversely , when mode exchange is complete , the oscillation plane shifts by larger angles ( up to 90 degrees ) in an apparently random manner .",

    "[ marcostellatofig05 ] .",
    "we note that the component along the spring axis of the force @xmath47 applied by the appended mass changes periodically during pendular oscillation and , in turn , alters spring extension .",
    "in particular , stretching - force oscillation causes the spring s equilibrium length to oscillate around its initial value @xmath48 : @xmath49 therefore , pendular and spring - oscillation modes are coupled .",
    "spring extension due to the weight makes a complete oscillation in half the time of one complete pendulum oscillation at resonance , that is when the ratio between the two oscillation periods @xmath50 and @xmath51 is 1/2 .",

    "the farther from the resonance condition , the lower the energy exchange .",
    "the observed mode exchange within an interval of frequency ratio reproduces the common physical fact that the resonance curves have gaussian - like form with a certain width .",
    "we can say that our resonance has a relatively large width .",
    "moreover , out of resonance , our measurements show that the greater the amplitude of vertical oscillation , the more extensive mode exchange becomes , yielding a wider resonance curve .",
