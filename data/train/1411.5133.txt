    "in recent years heavy ion collision experiments started to directly probe the phase diagram of qcd .",
    "in particular results from rhic and lhc shed some light on properties of the quark gluon plasma and the position of the crossover line . to fully explore the phase diagram",
    "theoretically we need to calculate thermodynamical quantities not only at finite temperature but also at finite baryon chemical potential . for finite temperature we can use lattice qcd , the only ab - initio method available . however , for finite baryon density lattice qcd faces the so - called complex action problem \" ( or  sign problem  ) . in that case",
    "the boltzmann factor becomes complex and can not be interpreted as a probability for importance sampling and the usual monte carlo approach fails . to learn something about the phase diagram at least for small chemical potential ,",
    "different methods have been developed and over the last years results have been obtained using reweighting methods , complex langevin techniques as well as taylor expansion in the chemical potential @xmath2 ( see , e.g. , @xcite for recent reviews ) .    in this paper",
    "we focus on a different expansion technique , the fugacity expansion . in this approach one",
    "expands the partition sum in a laurent series in the fugacity parameter @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the inverse temperature and @xmath2 is the chemical potential .",
    "this expansion is a rather natural choice , since the chemical potential on the lattice may be introduced as a boundary term by multiplying the factor @xmath0 ( @xmath5 ) on the forward ( backward ) temporal hopping term of the fermion action that connects the last with the first timeslice .",
    "furthermore , on a finite lattice the fugacity series is finite , while the taylor expansion always gives rise to an infinite series .",
    "for a first implementation of the fugacity expansion in qcd based on the strategy used here , see @xcite .",
    "preliminary results from this study and a variant for staggered fermions are documented in @xcite .",
    "recent comparisons of different expansion techniques to results from a dual variables simulation for a qcd related model have shown that the fugacity expansion may provide better convergence properties than the usual taylor expansion @xcite .",
    "here we want to explore the possibilities of the fugacity expansion in full qcd by calculating bulk observables related to the quark number which are particularly simple in the fugacity expansion .",
    "in particular the quark number density and also higher generalized susceptibilities are evaluated and are compared to hadron resonance gas model calculations .",
    "the results we present are for ensembles of @xmath6 wilson fermions on @xmath7 and @xmath8 lattices for temperatures below and above the crossover .",
    "the fugacity expansion is introduced in the following way : the partition function for @xmath6 mass degenerate quark flavors has the general form    @xmath9 \\ , e^{-s_g(u ) } \\ , \\det[d(\\mu , u)]^2 \\ ; , \\ ] ]    where @xmath10 denotes the usual wilson plaquette action and @xmath11 is the wilson dirac operator with chemical potential @xmath2 in a background gauge configuration @xmath12 ( from now on we omit the gauge field dependence as argument , but when useful display the dependence on the chemical potential @xmath2 ) .",

    "the evaluation of the integral in ( [ eq : candet ] ) becomes numerically harder ( see below ) and in actual calculations @xmath18 is limited by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is much smaller than @xmath22 .",
    "usually we can reach values up to @xmath27 in the numerical evaluation depending on the coupling and the volume of the considered ensemble .",
    "equations ( [ eq : fug1 ] ) and ( [ eq : candet ] ) provide an insight on how the chemical potential works physically , which in turn leads to an understanding of the numerical challenges of the fugacity expansion : the key issue is the size distribution of the terms in the sum ( [ eq : fug1 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ dq ] we plot as a function of @xmath18 the expectation value of the absolute value of the summands normalized by @xmath28 , i.e. , we plot @xmath29 ( for information about the complex phase of the @xmath23 see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath30 data show the distribution of the @xmath31 without the fugacity factors . in the plot with the linear scale ( top plot in fig .",
    "[ dq ] ) they display a gaussian - like distribution centered around @xmath32 .",
    "in addition to the linear scale , in the bottom plot we also show the @xmath29 using a log scale to better resolve the behavior in the tails of the distribution . when turning on the chemical potential the factors @xmath33 break the symmetry around @xmath32 and shift the distribution of the summands towards larger values of @xmath18 .",
    "this is exactly the behavior that we expect from a chemical potential : the system exhibits an average net quark number which is different from zero .",
    "note that the distribution for @xmath34 is the result of multiplying the factor @xmath33 , which exponentially increases with @xmath18 , with the gaussian - type of decay of the @xmath23 .",

    "in this study we consider bulk observables related to the quark number which are given by derivatives of the partition function with respect to the chemical potential @xmath2 , i.e. , the generalized susceptibilities ( @xmath43 ) :    @xmath44    here the label @xmath18 on the lhs .",

    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 will be particularly useful when we study ratios of generalized susceptibilities which have nice properties , not only for numerical tests , but are also convenient for a comparison with experiment @xcite .",

    "we did not observe deviations of the results and we conclude that the integration is stable for the values of @xmath18 we take into account here .    for obtaining the necessary accuracy of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : candet ] ) , i.e. , for the precise calculation of the canonical determinant @xmath54 $ ] , we use an exact evaluation with lu factorization .",
    "this is of course a sizable numerical effort and to reduce the computing time and memory requirements we apply the dimensional reduction given in @xcite ( for a different dimensional reduction formula of the wilson dirac operator determinant see @xcite ) .",
    "we here use a slightly modified form which is more suitable for our calculations ( see the appendix for a detailed derivation ) .",
