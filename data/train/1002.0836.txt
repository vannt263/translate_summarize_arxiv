    "high - precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and the agreement of these observations with our theoretical expectations has elevated cosmology to a precision science .",
    "the observed anisotropies have been measured to follow isotropic , gaussian statistics with an almost scale - invariant power - spectrum . however , as observations have improved , anomalies which might indicate deviations from the theoretical expectations have increased in significance .",
    "prosaic explanations for the observed anomalies may yet be found as our understanding of the systematics of the observations improves , but it is also of interest to explore whether these anomalies point us towards exotic and unexpected physics .",
    "one such anomaly is the apparent breakdown of statistical isotropy that has been reported in the cmb fluctuations at the largest observable scales @xcite measured by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) .",
    "two major observations that are suggestive of this statistical anisotropy refer to particular special directions in the sky .",
    "the first is the planarity of the quadrupole and octopole and their mutual alignment ; this plane is also roughly orthogonal to the cmb dipole direction @xcite .",
    "the second is an asymmetry in the amplitude of the power spectrum between the northern and southern ecliptic hemispheres @xcite which has also been observed in cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) data but at a lower significance @xcite .    with the evidence for these anomalies increasing as the data improves @xcite",
    "many studies have proposed modifications of early - universe physics in order to generate a violation of statistical isotropy ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a small selection ) .",
    "there have also been discussions of how a violation of statistical isotropy would affect other observations assuming that its source is primordial @xcite , enabling consistency tests of those hypotheses .",
    "however , soon after these anomalies were discovered , it was noticed that the directions associated with them corresponded to special directions within the local universe : four of the planes associated with the quadrupole and octopole are orthogonal to the ecliptic , the remaining octopole plane is orthogonal to the galactic plane , and the hemispherical asymmetry is aligned with the ecliptic .",
    "the heuristic connection between these cmb anomalies and our local environment has generated only a handful of quantitative attempts to connect the two , including possible foregrounds associated with the heliosphere @xcite , the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effect of free electrons in the galactic disk @xcite , the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect of the local universe @xcite , the rees - sciama effect of the local superclusters @xcite , and the integrated sachs - wolfe effect of the low - redshift universe @xcite .",
    "this is an area which deserves greater attention , since a very local signal can affect the largest observable scales .    in this paper",
    ", we explore another possible local origin of the anomalies by investigating how the scattering of cmb photons by free electrons diffusely distributed within the milky way halo through the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich ( ksz ) effect may introduce _ an anisotropic contamination _ of the primordial signal and help explain the origin of the anomalies and their alignment with special directions in the local universe .",
    "the effects of the ksz from the galactic halo on the cmb has been recently discussed in ref .",
    ". however ref .",
    "@xcite did not explore how the ksz may impact these anomalies and instead concentrated on whether the local ksz may produce a foreground that must be subtracted in order to extract the primordial signal .",
    "the prediction of an extended gaseous halo within the milky way is quite robust .",
    "models of galaxy formation for halos with masses @xmath0 predict infalling gas is shock - heated to the virial temperature ( around @xmath1 k for the milky way ) and remains in hydrostatic equilibrium until it is able to cool and condense to form stars @xcite . for a milky way - sized halo",
    "it is expected that the baryonic mass fraction follows the cosmic average , @xmath2 . by subtracting the total baryonic mass in stars and gas in the galaxy , a reasonable estimate of the baryonic mass in an extended , hot",
    ", gaseous halo is @xmath3@xcite .",
    "observations of ovii and oviii x - ray absorption have also indicated the existence of an extended hot gaseous halo @xcite associated with the milky way .",
    "furthermore , observations of pulsars yield estimates for the column density of free electrons and lead to a free - electron fraction within the milky way halo which is consistent with a hot gaseous halo with a column density of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "given that the milky way is moving relative to the cmb with a velocity @xmath5 , the local ksz may produce a signal around 1 @xmath6k .    in   [ sec:2 ]",
    "we point out that any anisotropic optical depth to thomson scattering off local electrons , coupled through the ksz effect with the dipole of the local electrons with respect to the cmb , induces an anisotropic imprint with a black - body spectrum .",
    "its alignment is determined by the dipole direction and the anisotropy of the distribution . given that the ksz is expected to be subdominant to the cosmological signal , in ",
    "[ sec : impact ] we point out the disproportionate impact on anomaly statistics of small signals .",
    "we make no judgement on the usefulness or otherwise of such _ a posteriori _ anomaly statistics ( for a post - wmap 7 year discussion of this point , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . instead , we take at face value anomaly statistics which have been invoked in a large body of literature , and study the impact of the ksz signal on their significance . in   [ sec : doppler_dip ] we derive the coupling of an anisotropic electron screen to the doppler dipole , and consider several physical models of the form of the anisotropic electron distribution in   [ sec : models ] .",
    "we compute the impact of these halo ksz models on anomaly statistics in ",
    "[ sec : stats ] , and discuss the results in   [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "a simple way to understand how an anisotropic optical depth leads to additional anisotropy in the cmb is to note that along a given line of sight , @xmath7 , with optical depth @xmath8 , the fraction of photons which scatter out of the line of sight is given by @xmath9\\left[\\bar{t}+ \\delta t({\\hat{{{\\mbox{\\boldmath${n}$}}}}})\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the temperature anisotropy along that line of sight . in addition , there are photons that scatter in to the line of sight isotropically from every other part of the sky ; thus , they contribute the mean temperature , @xmath11 , and the observed temperature anisotropy is @xcite @xmath12\\left[\\bar{t } + \\delta t\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\bar{t } \\left[1-e^{-\\tau(\\hat{\\bf n})}\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\bar{t } + \\delta t({\\hat{{{\\mbox{\\boldmath${n}$ } } } } } ) e^{-\\tau(\\hat{\\bf n})}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this simple calculation we can see that an anisotropic optical depth will couple with any inherent temperature anisotropies and thereby modulate the observed anisotropy .    a more rigorous way to derive",
    "the same result is to consider the boltzmann equation which dictates the evolution of the photon distribution function . in cosmology",
    "the application of the boltzmann equation leads to the usual evolution equations for the photon distribution function within a perturbed friedmann - roberson - walker ( frw ) universe @xcite .",
    "it can also be used to describe the evolution of the photon distribution function as the photons pass through the milky way s halo . denoting perturbations to the photon temperature by @xmath13 the boltzmann equation",

    "the thomson scattering cross - section is @xmath16 .",

    "( [ eq : boltzmann1 ] ) perturbatively .",

    "is approximately given by @xmath21 since @xmath22 @xcite and @xmath23 .",
    "as can be verified by substitution , the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltzmann2 ] ) is then given by @xmath24 where the integral extends along the line of sight .",

    "letting @xmath8 denote the optical depth as a function of position on the sky , assuming some underlying primordial temperature anisotropies then the optical depth is determined by @xmath31",
    "while , in principle , this effect can generate the observed large - angle isotropy anomalies , in practice ( given the expected column density of free electrons and the dipole velocity of the cmb ) , estimates of the ksz are at the @xmath32 @xmath6k level ( compared to the @xmath33 @xmath6k of the quadrupole ) . given",
    "that , at most , the ksz can produce @xmath34 10% modulations of the primary cmb , it would appear as though its effect on the observed anomalies would be negligible .",
    "however , as we now discuss , even a 10% modulation can have a large effect on the inferred statistical significance of these anomalies .",

    "the transformation between the general frame and the maximizing frame is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the wigner matrix corresponding to the appropriate rotation between the frames , and @xmath40 can take any value .",
    "the statistics given by the maximum values of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 have been used in the literature to quantify the planarity of the quadrupole and octopole , and also to capture their mutual alignment , respectively .",
    "table  [ tab : dispersionstats ] shows the values and @xmath44-values for these statistics for the wmap 7 year internal linear combination ( ilc7 ) foreground - cleaned map @xcite , with and without subtracting the kinematic quadrupole ( kq ) .",
    "the @xmath44-values are computed from 10,000 isotropic realizations .",
    "the kinematic quadrupole induced by the dipole anisotropy due to our motion relative to the cmb is at the level of @xmath45 @xmath6k @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath6k , whereas the cmb quadrupole is at the @xmath48 @xmath6k @xmath46 @xmath49 @xmath6k level .",

    "[ fig : maps ] since the inclusion of the triaxlmj screening field adds power in the northern galactic hemisphere and subtracts it from the southern hemisphere . for the other cases , the inferred amplitude decreases .    since the anisotropies induced by a local ksz are at the level of @xmath78 for @xmath79 ( see fig .",

    "a free - electron column density of this magnitude is ruled out by observations of ovii and oviii absorption @xcite and pulsar observations towards the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) @xcite .",

    "these anomalies could suggest that there may be some process which violates the statistical isotropy of the cmb fluctuations on large scales .",
    "although attempts have been made to modify the physics of the early universe in order to explain these anomalies , there are also strong reasons to look for explanations in the local universe .",
    "first , the directionality of these anomalies seems to closely coincide with both the solar cmb dipole as well as the velocity of the galactic barycenter relative to the cmb rest - frame .",
    "second , given that the anomalies are on large angular scales , any non - primordial and causal explanation must be local in origin .    here",
    "we have explored how a local ksz signal ( due to the motion of any extended hot gaseous halo associated with the milky way relative to the cmb ) may affect the significance of several anomalies observed in the cmb anisotropies .",
    "both theoretical and observational considerations indicate the presence of a hot gaseous halo with an extent of several tens of kiloparsecs @xcite .",
    "anisotropies in the optical depth through this gaseous halo can be due to the offset of the solar system from the galactic center , as well as any triaxiality in its distribution .",
    "we computed the ksz signal from several plausible physical models for the shape and orientation of the halo , and studied their impact on the observed cmb sky , in the form of the wmap ilc7 map .",
    "we considered how a local ksz may affect the observed planarity of the cmb quadrupole and octopole moments as well as their relative alignment , motivated by the fact that ksz from a triaxial halo can naturally relate to the special directions that appear to be associated with the @xmath81 and @xmath82 multipole moments .",
    "surprisingly , we found that relatively small changes in the observed amplitude of these moments ( @xmath83 ) to account for a ksz signal can reduce the already tiny @xmath44-values for these anomalies of up to factors of 27 .",
    "the corresponding free electron column density needed to affect the planarity / alignment statistics at this level is @xmath84  @xmath85 .",
    "a local ksz signal couples multipole moments of order @xmath35 to those of order @xmath86 , so it is natural to consider how such a signal would affect any inferred hemispherical asymmetry in the cmb anisotropies in the form of a dipolar modulation , which gives rise to the same coupling . using a statistic first derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , we found that a local ksz signal can have a significant effect on the inferred amplitude of a dipolar modulation of the primary cmb anisotropies . in this case , the corresponding free electron column density would need to be @xmath87 .",
    "theoretical and observational constraints on the free electron fraction in a extended hot gaseous halo associated with the milky way place a fairly strict bound on the column density of @xmath88 .",
    "the most precise constraints come from observations of the dispersion measure to individual pulsars @xcite which find a column density in free electrons to the lmc of @xmath89 .",
    "given that the lmc is @xmath90 kpc from the galactic center and that the scale - radius of the milky way halo is @xmath91 kpc , these observations indicate that the total optical depth may be as large as @xmath92 .",
    "in addition to this , observations of local ( @xmath93 ) ovii and oviii absorption towards several quasars indicates the presence of an extended hot gaseous halo around the milky way @xcite .",
    "the inferred free electron column density is quite uncertain given assumptions about the metallicity of the gas ( solar abundance was assumed to convert the observations to an electron density ; sub - solar values would increase the inferred density ) , as well as a model dependence coming from the assumed profile of the gas .",
    "finally , theoretical considerations imply the existence of a hot extended gaseous halo with a fractional mass of the order of the cosmic baryon fraction , @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , for a milky way sized halo ( @xmath95 ) with a scale radius of 300 kpc , we would expect a column density no larger than @xmath92 .",
    "given that , for a local ksz signal to have a significant effect on the cmb anisotropies , we must have a free electron column density @xmath96 , but that both theoretical and observational considerations place the limit at @xmath97 , it is unlikely that a local ksz signal can explain any of the cmb anomalies considered here .",
    "even given the uncertainties , the ksz signal can at best only be at the lowest amplitude needed to affect the anomaly statistics .",
    "finally , we note that contamination from ksz in the solar system can also , in principle , provide an anisotropic contamination of the cmb sky at large angles .",
    "the geometry of the heliopause is coincidentally aligned with the cmb dipole @xcite , providing a motivation for looking there for a explanation for the special directional properties of the large - angle isotropy anomalies . however , in practice , the optical depth of free electrons in the solar system is more than 7 orders of magnitude below what is required to produce the necessary signal ."
