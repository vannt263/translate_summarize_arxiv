    "consider the following integral @xcite @xmath5 + where we imply that all variables @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are real .",
    "assuming that @xmath9 the integral can be rewritten as @xmath10    the error function can be represented in form of a sum of the gaussian functions ( see appendix a ) @xmath11 consequently , substituting this limit into the equation leads to @xmath12 each integral term in this equation is analytically integrable .",
    "consequently , we obtain a new equation for the arctangent function @xmath13    since @xmath14 it follows that @xmath15 it should be noted that the limit has been reported already in our recent work @xcite .",
    "truncation of the limit yields a rational approximation of the arctangent function @xmath16 figure 1 shows the difference between the original arctangent function @xmath1 and its rational approximation @xmath17 over the range @xmath18 at @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 shown by blue , red , green , brown and black curves , respectively . as we can see from this figure , the difference @xmath24 is dependent upon @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , it increases with increasing argument by absolute value @xmath25 .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the rational approximation of the arctangent function is more accurate when its argument is smaller .",
    "consequently , in order to obtain a higher accuracy we have to look for an equation in the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the coefficients , with arguments of the arctangent function as small as possible by absolute value @xmath29 .",
    "for example , applying the equation we may expect that at some fixed @xmath30 the approximation @xmath31 is less accurate than the approximation based on the machins formula @xcite @xmath32\\\\   & \\approx 16l\\sum\\limits_{\\ell   = 1}^l { \\left ( { \\frac{{4\\left ( { 1/5 } \\right)}}{{{{\\left ( { 2\\ell   - 1 } \\right)}^2}{{\\left ( { 1/5 } \\right)}^2 } + 4{l^2 } } } - \\frac{{1/239}}{{{{\\left ( { 2\\ell   - 1 } \\right)}^2}{{\\left ( { 1/239 } \\right)}^2 } + 4{l^2 } } } } \\right)}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] furthermore , with same equation for @xmath1 we can improve accuracy by using another formula for pi @xcite @xmath33\\\\   \\approx & \\ , 16l\\sum\\limits_{\\ell   = 1}^l \\left ( \\frac{{12\\left ( { 1/18 } \\right)}}{{{{\\left ( { 2\\ell   - 1 } \\right)}^2}{{\\left ( { 1/18 } \\right)}^2 } + 4{l^2 } } } + \\frac{{8\\left ( { 1/57 } \\right)}}{{{{\\left ( { 2\\ell   - 1 } \\right)}^2}{{\\left ( { 1/57 } \\right)}^2 } + 4{l^2 } } } \\right .",
    ". - \\frac{{5\\left ( { 1/239 } \\right)}}{{{{\\left ( { 2\\ell   - 1 } \\right)}^2}{{\\left ( { 1/239 } \\right)}^2 } + 4{l^2 } } } \\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] due to smaller arguments @xmath34 of the arctangent function .",
    "once the rational approximation for the arctangent function is found , from the identity @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the signum function @xcite , it follows that @xmath37    figure 2 shows the expansion series computed at @xmath19 ( blue curve ) .",
    "the arctangent function is also shown for comparison ( red curve ) . as we can see from this figure , on the left - half plane",
    "the expansion series is greater than the original arctangent function by @xmath38 , while on the right - half plane it is smaller than the original arctangent function by @xmath38 .",
    "the approximation can be replaced with exact relation by tending the integer @xmath30 to infinity and taking the limit as @xmath39 since this limit represents a simple generalization of the equation , the function @xmath40 can be regarded as a counterpart to the arctangent function @xmath1 .      using the limits and for the arctangent function @xmath1 and its counterpart function @xmath2 , we can readily obtain an asymptotic expansion series for pi .",
    "let us rewrite the equation as follows @xmath41 the difference of the equations and yields @xmath42 or @xmath43 = \\frac{\\pi } { 2}{\\rm{sgn}}\\left ( x \\right)\\ ] ] or @xmath44}\\ ] ] since @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "obviously , the equation can be interpreted as @xmath46.\\ ] ]    remarkably , although the argument @xmath7 is still present in the limit this asymptotic expansion series remains , nevertheless , independent of @xmath7 .",
    "this signifies that according to equation the constant @xmath47 can be computed at any real value of the argument @xmath48 .",
    "the limit can be truncated by an arbitrarily large value @xmath49 as given by @xmath50}.\\ ] ] we performed sample computations by using wolfram mathematica 9 in enhanced precision mode in order to visualize the number of coinciding digits with actual value of the constant pi @xmath51 the sample computations show that accuracy of the approximation limit depends upon the two values @xmath30 and @xmath7 ( the dependence on the argument @xmath7 in the equation is due to truncation now ) .",
    "for example , at @xmath52 and @xmath53 , we get @xmath54 while at same @xmath52 but smaller @xmath55 , the result is @xmath56 comparing these approximated values with the actual value for the constant pi one can see that at @xmath53 and @xmath55 the quantity of coinciding digits are @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the argument @xmath7 can not be taken arbitrarily small since its optimized value depends upon the chosen integer @xmath59",
    "we obtain an efficient rational approximation for the arctangent function @xmath1 that can be generalized to its counterpart function @xmath60 .",
    "the application of the expansion series of the arctangent function and its counterpart results in a new formula for @xmath4 .",
    "the computational test we performed shows that the new asymptotic expansion series for pi may be rapid in convergence .",

    "consider an integral of the error function ( see integral 12 on page 4 in @xcite ) @xmath61 this integral can be readily expressed through the sinc function @xmath62 by making change of the variable @xmath63 leading to @xmath64 or @xmath65 the factor @xmath66 in the argument of the sinc function can be excluded by making change of the variable @xmath67 again .",
    "this provides @xmath68 or @xmath69    as it has been shown in our recent publication , the sinc function can be expressed as given by @xcite @xmath70 from the following integral @xmath71 it is not difficult to see that the cosine expansion of the sinc function is just a result of integration of equation performed by using the midpoint rule over each infinitesimal interval @xmath72 .",
    "there are many cosine expansions of the sinc function can be found from equation by taking integral with help of efficient integration methods @xcite .",
    "for example , another cosine expansions of the sinc function can be found by using the trapezoidal rule @xmath73\\ ] ] and the simpsons rule @xmath74.\\ ] ] it is interesting to note that the limit can also be derived trivially as a weighted sum of equations and in a proportion @xmath75 to @xmath76 as follows @xmath77 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    any of these or similar cosine expansions of the sinc function can be used in integration to obtain expansion series for the error function @xmath78 and , consequently , for the constant pi as well .",
    "however , as a simplest case we consider an application of equation only .",
    "thus , substituting the cosine expansion of the sinc function into the integral yields @xmath79 each terms in this equation is analytically integrable .",
