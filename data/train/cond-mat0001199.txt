    "important developments have been taking place in the growth of strained heterostructures based on si and ge@xmath0si@xmath1 layers @xcite .",
    "the particular case of si layers pseudomorphically grown on relaxed ge@xmath0si@xmath2 buffers is rather interesting because of the large mobilities reported , exceeding the corresponding bulk @xmath3 values @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in this type of double heterostructures ( dhs ) the otherwise degenerate six @xmath4 valleys of bulk si are shifted in energy . if the dhs is grown along a high symmetry direction ( say , the @xmath5 direction ) , the two valleys along this direction are shifted downwards in energy , while the other four valleys are shifted upwards . as a result , we are led to two @xmath6 valleys with a bottom energy below the corresponding one for the bulk valleys and four @xmath7 valleys with a higher bottom energy .",
    "the energy shift between the @xmath6 and @xmath8 valleys is empirically estimated as @xmath9 ev . in this kind of dhs , a quantum - well like band alignment in the si channel",
    "was unexpectedly found in 1985@xcite , which is due to tensile strains in si and ensures high - mobility @xmath10 channel for the doped structure .",
    "high mobilities are explained as a consequence of the low effective mass of the carriers in @xmath6 valleys and also because the scattering efficiency of the carriers ( by phonons and impurities ) is reduced .",
    "the above mentioned facts are of great importance for device performance and this kind of structures seems to have a prominent future for applications in micro and optoelectronics @xcite .",
    "monte carlo calculations of high electric field mobilities and drift velocities for electronic transport along the si channel of si / ge@xmath0si@xmath2 were reported by various authors @xcite and also applied in the study of modulation - doped field - effect transistor ( modfet ) structures @xcite .",
    "more recently , hole transport parameters have been analyzed for this type of systems @xcite .",
    "while the electronic transport properties of low field , low temperature si / gesi heterostructures are more or less well understood @xcite , the situation is not the same for high electric fields . for high field transport , the effects of size quantization are usually negligible and we can work within three dimensional models for the valley structure . in ref .",
    "@xcite , size quantization was introduced in a 10 nm si channel , but the authors had to include up to six subbands in the @xmath11 valleys .",
    "strain effects are introduced through the splitting energy @xmath12 between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 valleys , which ranges from @xmath13ev to @xmath14ev .",
    "such relatively large values of the energy shift effectively reduce the intervalley phonon scatterings between the valleys ( in comparison with the unstrained si ) .    in the present paper",
    "we report results for high electric field electronic transport along the si channel of a si / gesi dhs .",
    "we model the system in close analogy with the above mentioned works , taking into account the energy shift between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 valleys and neglecting size quantization . rather than monte carlo simulations",
    ", we apply an analytical fokker - planck approach ( fpa ) , which treats transport as an energy - diffusion process in energy space .",
    "this approach was proposed a long time ago @xcite as an alternative for the consideration of high - field transport in semiconductors .",
    "the theory bears a semiclassical nature and has been recently revisited , the general formalism being discussed with further details @xcite . as a test of the fpa in the case of a well known semiconductor , the present authors applied the theory to bulk si , where both experimental data and monte carlo simulations for the high field drift velocity were successfully reproduced @xcite .",
    "the current calculations can also be considered as a way of testing the fpa in a somewhat different system , which is of present day interest in high technology applications .",
    "the fpa is applicable when the energy exchanges between the carriers and the surrounding medium ( crystal lattice + external field ) can be assumed quasicontinuous .",
    "this latter condition apparently invalidates the method for highly inelastic scattering mechanisms ( as is the case of carrier scattering by optic and intervalley phonons ) .",
    "however , if the carrier energy is large enough , the exchanged energy becomes certainly low compared with the energy of the carriers , and this is the case of high field transport .",
    "hence , the fpa is assumed to be valid if the condition @xmath15 is fulfilled , where @xmath16 is the average carrier energy and @xmath17 the exchanged energy ( say , the phonon energy ) .",
    "the fpa has the advantage of being analytical , and , whenever it can be applied , saves computational time and allows a more transparent physical interpretation .",
    "of course , it can not compete in accuracy with monte carlo simulations .",
    "however , we have found that the fpa leads to comparatively good results even in cases where several scattering mechanisms should be taken into account @xcite .",
    "in contrast with monte carlo simulations , the analytical approach involves less realistic models for the analysis of a concrete semiconductor .",
    "more details about the applied model and the fundamental theory are given in the next sections .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly summarize general theoretical aspects of our work , in sec .",
    "iii details of the calculations for the si / gesi dhs are presented , in sec .",
    "iv the results of our calculations are shown and comparison with previous works is made .",
    "the fpa considers transport in the spirit of a drift - diffusion process in energy space . a certain distribution function ( df ) , @xmath18 , is defined which depends on the carrier energy @xmath19 and the time @xmath20 , such that @xmath21 gives the number of carriers at time @xmath20 having their energies in the interval @xmath22 $ ] , while the function @xmath23 represents the density of states ( dos ) .",

    "equation ( [ e1 ] ) has the form of a continuity equation for the carrier `` motion '' in energy space and leads to the conservation of the carrier `` flux '' . for a many valley system",

    "this overlapping integral was assumed unity in the general formulas of sec .",
    "ii , but actually it differs from unity when intervalley phonons are present . the linear behavior of @xmath16 for @xmath121 kv / cm should not be realistic because the fpa is not valid in the low - field regime as discussed exhaustively in previous works .",

    "it is obtained a decreasing behavior of the drift velocity at a rate that becomes much higher as higher is the field . in our present treatment ( as well as in that of ref .",

    "3 we show the same plots as those of fig .  2 , but now for @xmath124 k. from a simple glance at fig .",
    "3 , it is obvious that for such a low temperature the agreement between the fpa and the monte carlo results of ref .",
    "@xcite ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) is much worse .",
    "as it was discussed before , we have ignored intravalley acoustic phonons . even though this is not a limitation of the fpa itself ,",
    "it is a difficult task to include them in the calculations .",
    "furthermore , at low temperatures , quantum effects should become relevant and a quantum approach should be required .",
    "hence , we stress that the fpa  results are reliable just for high temperatures .    in this work",
    "we have compared our results with those from monte carlo simulations.@xcite other possible comparisons could be done .",
    "for instance , we could compare with fig .  3 of ref.@xcite or ref.@xcite .",
    "but all these results are in accordance with themselves and nothing essential would be added .",
    "our results are also comparable to those of ref .",
    "@xcite , where size quantization was examined . as it was said before ,",
    "size quantization is of relevance when the carrier energies are low enough ( this is the case of low field transport as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but for the high carrier energies involved in high field transport , size quantization becomes irrelevant . in the revised literature we have not found available experimental data for this kind of system . as a general remark , we conclude that the fpa leads to results in acceptable agreement with those of monte carlo simulations in those intervals of temperature and electric fields where it is supposed to be valid .",
    "this conclusion is true in spite of the more or less coarse simplifications we have to face within the limits of this method .",
