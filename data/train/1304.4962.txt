    "we have presented grids of lte ( @xcite , paper i ) and non - lte ( nlte ) ( @xcite , paper ii ) atmospheric models and synthetic spectral energy distributions ( seds ) computed with phoenix @xcite for gk dwarfs and giants ( luminosity class v and iii ) of solar and @xmath7 solar metallicity ( @xmath0=0.0 $ ] and @xmath8 ) , and described a procedure for quantitatively comparing them to mean observed seds carefully selected from the large absolute spectrophotometric catalog of @xcite ( henceforth , b85 ) .",
    "our strongest conclusion from paper ii is that the adoption of nlte for many opacity sources shifts the spectrophotometrically determined @xmath2 scale for giants downward by an amount , @xmath9 , in the range of about 30 to 90 k all across the mid - g to mid - k spectral class range , and across the @xmath0 $ ] range from 0.0 to -0.5 .",
    "this shift brings our spectrophotometrically derived @xmath2 scale for the solar metallicity g giants into closer agreement with the less model - dependent @xmath2 scale determined by the irfm , although our @xmath2 values for these g giants are too large in any case .",
    "we also found tentative evidence on the basis of two spectral classes in the g range that this nlte downward shift in the @xmath2 scale becomes smaller as luminosity class increases from iii to v.    [ [ section ] ]    in papers i and ii we divided the observed sed into two spectral bands , designated `` blue '' and `` red '' , with a break - point at 4600  , which is the wavelength around where the sed apparently changes character qualitatively , from being relatively smooth ( @xmath10 , `` red '' ) to being more heavily affected by over - blanketing by spectral lines ( @xmath11 , `` blue '' ) .",
    "the quality of the fit of both lte and nlte model seds to the red band was significantly better than that to the blue band .",
    "this is to be expected because the blue region is more heavily line blanketed , and is expected to be more sensitive to , among other things , the distribution of the abundances of individual chemical elements .",
    "this region is also relatively sensitive to inaccuracies and incompleteness in the input atomic transition parameters ( oscillator strengths , damping parameters , _ etc . _ ) , and to the treatment of line formation and of the atmospheric models ( _ e.g. _ 1d rather than 3d ) .",
    "however , somewhat surprisingly , fits to the red and blue bands yielded the same best fit @xmath2 values for many spectral classes .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    in the present investigation we take the step of perturbing the abundance distribution of our model grid , by perturbing both the fiducial solar abundance distribution adopted , and the choice of a solar or non - solar abundance distribution for the models of @xmath0=-0.5 $ ] , and studying the effect upon the quality and model parameters of the best fits .",
    "we believe this is timely and justified as there have been important recent proposed revisions to the solar abundance distribution , as discussed in greater detail below ( for example , compare @xcite to @xcite ) . a goal is to investigate the sensitivity of the spectrophotometric @xmath2 scale to the abundance pattern , and to compare it to the sensitivity to the thermodynamic treatment ( lte _ vs. _ nlte ) .",
    "this will become increasingly important as instruments that can produce calibrated spectrophotometry over broad wavelength ranges yield data for larger samples of late - type stars ( _ eg .",
    "_ vlt + xshooter observations of red supergiants @xcite ) . furthermore ,",
    "accurate abundance measurements in late - type stars , particularly of refractory elements , has become especially important when comparing planet - hosting stars to the general stellar population ( see , for example , @xcite ) , and generally , the accuracy of abundance measurements depends on the accuracy of the @xmath2 determination ( see , for example , @xcite , who find from a nlte analysis that @xmath12/{\\rm d}t_{\\rm eff } = -0.03 $ ] dex/80 k ) .",
    "in paper i we described in detail a procedure for vetting and combining observed seds selected from the catalog of absolutely calibrated , and uniformly re - calibrated , spectrophotometry ( seds ) of b85 , and we only briefly recapitulate here . to state it more starkly",
    "than we did in papers i or ii , b85 is the largest catalog of absolute stellar spectrophotometry that we are aware of ( @xmath14 stars ) , and covers a broad enough @xmath15 range ( conservatively , @xmath16 ) to allow evaluation of model sed fits to the heavily line - blanketed blue and near - uv spectral regions , given a fit to the relatively unblanketed red region .",
    "@xcite contains a more detailed description of the individual data sources included in this compilation .",
    "we emphasize again here , that this data set was uniformly _",
    "re_-calibrated , by burnashev ( b85 ) , so it should be less affected by random star - to - star errors than the original data .",
    "moreover , it contains large enough samples of stars of nominally identical spectral type ( spectral class and luminosity class ) , as confirmed by cross - reference to other spectroscopic catalogs , and similar metallicity , as determined by cross - reference to the metallicity catalog of @xcite , that we can assess the variation , and thus the quality , of the seds and reject those that are suspect .",
    "the final results of our procedure are `` sample mean '' and @xmath17 observed seds for each spectral type of each metallicity bin ( @xmath18=\\pm 0.1 $ ] ) considered .",
    "paper i contains details of how many seds were in each sample , and plots showing the typical variation among the observed seds , for illustrative spectral types .",
    "these mean observed seds are the `` data product '' to which we compare our model seds here .",
    "in paper i we describe an lte grid of spherical atmospheric models computed with phoenix for a star of mass @xmath19 , and corresponding high resolution synthetic spectra , that spans the spectral class range from about g0 to k4 ( @xmath20 k , @xmath21 k ) and luminosity class range from v to iii ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , and scaled solar metallicities , @xmath0 $ ] , of 0.0 and -0.5 , with a mixing length parameter , @xmath24 , defined by the bhm - vitense treatment of convection of one pressure scale height . in the current investigation , we are concerned with the sub - set of the grid corresponding to giants ( @xmath25 ) ( the only metal - poor ( @xmath0\\approx -0.5 $ ] ) gk stars in the b85 catalog are giants and supergiants , and the modeling of supergiants requires special additional considerations that are beyond the scope of this investigation . ) the choice of @xmath0 $ ] values was guided by the availability of objects in the b85 catalog .",
    "paper ii describes the nlte version of this grid , in which the lowest two ionization stages of 24 chemical elements up to ni , and thousands of atomic transitions ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) are treated in self - consistent nlte statistical equilibrium ( se ) , accounting simultaneously for nlte radiative transfer in those radiative atomic transitions that are accounted for in the se rate equations .      in paper",
    "i , we described a finer grid of seds , with @xmath28 k , derived from this basic grid by linear interpolation in the @xmath29 relation .",
    "here we have derived an even finer grid , with @xmath3 k and @xmath30 , by quadratic interpolation in the @xmath29 and linear interpolation in the @xmath31 relations .",
    "the @xmath29 interpolation was performed using two different methods to interpolate values in the interval @xmath32 $ ] : i ) simple quadratic interpolation by fitting a parabola to the three points @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and ii ) least - squares quadratic interpolation by fitting a parabola to the four points @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the two methods generally gave interpolated @xmath37 values that were within @xmath38 of each other , and were both found to yield an interpolated @xmath39 function that was smooth and well - behaved as determined by exhaustive visual inspection .",
    "moreover , seds interpolated with both methods yielded the same best fit parameters to within the numerical precision of our grid when the @xmath40 deviation from observed seds was minimized ( see section [ fitstats ] ) .",
    "the results presented here are based on the least - squares quadratic interpolation .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    the choice of @xmath3 k is consistent with the recent ground - breaking investigation of @xcite , who found mean deviations of @xmath41 k among values of @xmath2 derived with interferometric - asteroseismic , spectroscopic , and photometric techniques for stars of @xmath42 k , including red giants .",

    "the nominal sampling of the b85 catalog is 25  , but the instrumental profile is apparently unknown . in paper",
    "i and ii we presented a grid in which the microturbulent broadening parameter , @xmath44 , increases from 2.0 to 4.0 km s@xmath45 as @xmath4 decreases from 3.0 to 1.0 . to remove variation of a physically ill - motivated variable from our grid",

    "the gs98 distribution is based on a compilation and review of abundances derived largely from 1d lte semi - empirical solar photosphere and spectrum modeling , checked against meteoritic abundances for relevant elements .",

    "given the scale of the computational task of re - computing @xmath53 models and spectra , we have restricted ourselves to investigating the effects of only these two solar distributions , and take them as being representative of the recent variation in the reputable measured solar abundance distributions .",

    "( note that the residuals vary with large amplitude in @xmath15 regions where the flux derivative @xmath54 of the sed is large . )",
    "the main effect of perturbing the abundance distribution is that the gass10 abundances lead to a larger blue and near - uv band flux as compared that of the gs98 abundances , while the two distributions yield similar red band fluxes .",

    "as expected , for solar metallicity stars , we find that the effect of nlte on spectrophotometrically derived @xmath2 values compared to lte is about the same for both the gass10 and gs98 abundance distributions , namely a reduction of 50 to 75 k. as with the models of @xmath0=0.0 $ ] , for the metal - poor stars the nlte reduction of the @xmath2 scale is independent of choice of solar abundance distribution , although we note that the effect is more pronounced for the g8 iii sample ( 75 k for three of the four abundance distributions ) , than it is for the k1.5 iii sample ( 25 k for three of the four abundance distributions , and never more than 50 k ) .      for solar metallicity stars , we conclude that there is evidence that adoption of the gass10 abundances lowers the inferred nlte spectrophotometric @xmath2 scale by 25 to 50 k as compared to the gs98 abundances .",
    "generally , the two abundance distributions yield the same nlte best fit @xmath4 value to within the @xmath69 grid resolution of 0.25 . for solar metallicity stars , nlte models computed with the gass10 abundances give , on balance , @xmath2 results that are marginally in better agreement with other t@xmath6 calibrations in the literature determined by a variety of means .",
    "we conclude that for stars of @xmath71 = -0.5 $ ] , we are not resolving a clear trend for the effect of choice of solar abundance distribution on the @xmath2 value inferred from the sed .",
    "there is marginal evidence , based entirely on the g8 iii sample , that the adoption of @xmath1-enhancement leads to a reduction of 50 k in the nlte sed - fitted @xmath2 value .",
    "the choice of solar abundance distribution has a negligible effect on the derived @xmath4 values .",
    "however , there is evidence that @xmath1-enhanced models lead to derived @xmath4 values that are 0.25 to 0.5 ( one to two @xmath69 resolution elements ) larger than those of scaled solar models , regardless of choice of solar abundance distribution . with only two spectral classes , it is difficult to draw conclusions about which abundance distribution better fits other @xmath2 calibrations .      we conclude that stellar parameters inferred from fitting nlte models to seds are more dependent than lte models on the wavelength region being fitted , and find that the effect depends on how heavily line blanketed the fitting region is , whether the fitting region is to the blue of the wien peak of the star s sed , or both .",
    "we will make both the library of observed seds and the nlte ( and corresponding lte ) grid of model seds with all abundance distributions available to the community by ftp + ( http://www.ap.smu.ca/  ishort / phoenix ) .",
