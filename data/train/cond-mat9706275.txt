    "the properties of a magnetic impurity in a semiconductor or an insulator are of interest for a variety of reasons . in a normal fermi system a spin-@xmath4 impurity yields logarithmic temperature dependences in the impurity susceptibility and the resistivity at high temperatures ; at low temperatures the magnetic moment is quenched @xcite .",
    "the existence of a sharp fermi surface and the concomitant occurrence of ( low - energy ) particle - hole pairs play an important role in understanding the behavior of the model .",
    "thus it is interesting from a theoretical point of view to understand whether the kondo effect persists and under what conditions quenching occurs in a system with a gap and determine the behavior quantitatively .",
    "we also note that the anderson impurity has been studied in the context of the logarithmic temperature dependence of the conductivity of trans - polyacetylene @xcite ; the system was modeled by a continuum hamiltonian that exhibits a gap due to peierls distortion .",
    "the impurity model was investigated using a hartree - fock closure of the equation of motion .",
    "in addition , a variety of kondo and valence fluctuating insulators ( modeled theoretically by a kondo or anderson lattice ) such as @xmath5 and @xmath6 among others provide another motivation for studying the single impurity problem in a system with a gap .",
    "in this paper we present the results of our study of the kondo and anderson impurities in a system with a gap .",
    "we apply wilson s ( numerical ) renormalization group ( rg ) technique using a variant of a numerical tridiagonalization method devised by us earlier@xcite and provide results for both the susceptibility and zero - frequency response functions .",
    "we also discuss a simple effective hamiltonian that allows us to understand the physics underlying our results .",
    "we begin with a summary of previous work on the problem ; in the next section we provide a brief sketch of the technique that is described in detail in the literature @xcite .",
    "we then present the results of our numerical simulations and in the final section we discuss the effective hamiltonian description of our results .",
    "we begin with a brief overview of previous work .",
    "the first calculations were done by ogura and saso @xcite and takegahara _ et al .",
    "ogura and saso used a @xmath7 expansion of the degenerate anderson model and found to leading order a transition between the triplet and singlet ground states when the gap @xmath8 equals twice the kondo temperature @xmath9 . in their quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations they found indications of a similar transition even for the symmetric anderson model @xcite ; for the asymmetric model they obtained a transition between the different ground states at approximately @xmath10 .",
    "we note that their qmc computations were limited to temperatures above @xmath11 .",
    "takegahara , shimizu , and sakai @xcite used both quantum monte carlo simulations and the numerical renormalization group method of wilson .",
    "they considered the symmetric anderson model and found that at low temperatures the susceptibility follows a curie law resulting from an unquenched magnetic moment .",
    "they observed the crucial difference between symmetric and asymmetric anderson models cases ; when particle - hole symmetry is obeyed the moment remains unquenched for all non - zero values of the gap while there is a transition in the asymmetric case .",
    "they also used the wilson numerical renormalization group to follow the spectrum of the low - energy states but not the susceptibility .",
    "it is difficult to use their version of the numerical rg formulation to calculate low temperature ( much less than the band gap ) properties of the model .",
    "yu and guerrero @xcite studied an anderson impurity in a semiconducting host using the density matrix renormalization technique .",
    "their calculation which is restricted to @xmath12 considered electron spin - impurity spin correlation functions and found no _ qualitative difference _ between the symmetric and asymmetric cases .",
    "we will comment on this point later .",
    "the importance of the particle - hole symmetry breaking has been emphasized recently @xcite in the context of the kondo problem with a pseudogap . in this work",
    "the impurity susceptibility for the case of a kondo system with a gap was also calculated using the wilson renormalization group method : in the particle - hole symmetric case the impurity retains its moment in the ground state for all @xmath13 ; in the presence of potential scattering the moment is completely quenched provided that @xmath14 .",
    "these results are in agreement with those of takegahara _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "we have made a comprehensive study of the kondo and anderson models in gapped systems with and without particle - hole symmetry breaking using the numerical rg method .",
    "our rg formulation is based on the numerical tridiagonalization technique developed by us @xcite , which allows us to calculate various quantities in the entire temperature range .",
    "we report results for a zero - frequency response function , correlation functions and the susceptibility : we emphasize the differences in their behaviors in the various regimes and clarify which of these are good probes of the nature of the low - temperature fixed point behavior .",
    "we use the ( numerical ) tridiagonalization scheme devised by us earlier @xcite to transform the hamiltonian to the following tridiagonalized form : @xmath52 ~+~(\\epsilon_d+\\frac{1}{2}u)~c^+_{d\\mu}c_{d\\mu } \\nonumber   \\\\ & & ~+~ \\left[\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\pi}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}~(f^+_{0\\mu}c_{d\\mu}+ c^+_{d\\mu}f_{0\\mu})~+~\\frac{u}{2}(c^+_{d\\mu}c_{d\\mu}-1)^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 .    in order to carry out the rg calculation",

    "the recursion relation can be written in the following compact form : @xmath60 this recursion relation enables one to set up an iterative diagonalization scheme to calculate the energy levels of @xmath54 and thus to determine thermodynamic properties ; the recursion is implemented numerically and is stopped at @xmath61 corresponding to the edge of the gap below which there are no conduction electron states . recall that as we increase @xmath62 , the system effectively evolves from high temperatures to low temperatures . at a given @xmath62 ,",

    "the thermodynamic quantities are calculated for @xmath66 for a selected value of @xmath64 ; the accuracy of the numerical evaluations is enhanced by performing a second - order perturbation calculation by writing the hamiltonian as @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69\\right\\}.\\ ] ]    for @xmath61 , the thermodynamic quantities are calculated for a sequence of temperatures @xmath70 . since @xmath71 is the full hamiltonian ( hence , no second order perturbation is needed ) , we can calculate the quantities at temperatures much lower than typical energy scale at @xmath61 , which is the bandgap @xmath50 .",
    "we choose @xmath72 to be a sequence of values from @xmath73 of the maximum energy kept in the many body states of @xmath74 to @xmath75 of the maximum energy .",

    "the first and obvious quantity to consider is the impurity susceptibility , @xmath79 , which we emphasize is defined as the total susceptibility of the system minus the susceptibility of the pure system . in the kondo problem in the absence of potential scattering @xmath80 approaches the value @xmath81 as @xmath82 for _ any _ finite bandgap .",
    "the ground state is a magnetic doublet , its quantum numbers are @xmath83 .",

    "in this section we provide a simple interpretation of the low - temperature behavior of the models in the various regimes on the basis of a simple effective hamiltonian .",

    "the effective hamiltonian is close to that of the @xmath132 fixed point and can be written , keeping the leading order terms , as @xmath133 here @xmath134 and @xmath135 . in the above effective hamiltonian",
    "we have only kept the lowest single electron / hole levels of the conduction electron hamiltonian ; these are represented by the creation operators @xmath136 and @xmath137 and we have neglected the irrelevant operators . since @xmath138 is proportional to @xmath139 , we have @xcite @xmath140 thus the first two terms of @xmath141 are marginal , and @xmath13 and @xmath142 must scale as @xmath143 and @xmath144 . when @xmath145 and @xmath146 , the last term dominates , and the ground state is a doublet .",
