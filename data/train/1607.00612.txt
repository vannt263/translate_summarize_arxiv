    "primordial black holes ( pbhs ) , the possibility of whose formation was predicted in @xcite and @xcite , can give valuable information about processes in the early universe @xcite , in particular , about the shape of the perturbation spectrum on small scales @xcite . the quantum evaporation of low - mass pbhs",
    "is important from the viewpoint of investigating fundamental processes at high energies @xcite and can have significance for the theory of primordial nucleosynthesis and gamma - ray astronomy .",
    "in addition , pbhs can offer new possibilities for the formation of quasars at high @xmath4 @xcite and for baryonic objects with chemical peculiarities@xcite .",
    "being captured by neutron stars , pbhs can affect their evolution , which gives a constraint on the number of pbhs @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will discuss only the pbhs that are formed during the collapses of adiabatic density perturbations , when a mixture of relativistic particles collapses into a pbh at the instant the perturbation crosses the cosmological horizon @xcite .",
    "note , however , that other pbh formation models have also been proposed at early dust - like stages @xcite or through the collapses of domain walls @xcite , @xcite .",
    "pbhs can themselves represent dark matter ( dm ) @xcite if they are formed in sufficiently large quantities , but they can also serve as seeds for the formation of dm clumps @xcite .",
    "secondary accretion ( generally , this mechanism was developed in cold dm onto a pbh @xcite , when dm flows toward the pbh and is virialized at some radius to form a halo , is usually considered in investigating dm clumps around pbhs . in this paper",
    ", we will show that the dm density around pbhs can reach much greater values than that under secondary accretion .",
    "this stems from the fact that in the thermal velocity distribution there are dm particles with low velocities that remain in finite orbits around pbhs and are not involved in the overall cosmological expansion .",
    "the accumulation of such particles around pbhs gives rise to density spikes ( halos ) .",
    "two regimes of density spike formation around pbhs are possible at the radiation - dominated stage . in the first case , which occurs for pbhs with masses @xmath5 ,",
    "pbhs are formed before the kinetic decoupling of dm particles ( under the assumption that the dm particles are neutralinos with masses @xmath6  gev ) . in the interval between the pbh formation and kinetic decoupling ,",
    "a dm overdensity has time to be formed around the pbh .",
    "as will be shown below , the exact form of this initial density distribution does not play a big role , while the separation of dm particles immediately after their kinetic decoupling is important .",
    "after their kinetic decoupling , the dm particles begin to fly apart in the pbh gravitational field , having some velocity distribution ( a deformed maxwell distribution ) .",
    "some of the particles with low velocities remain gravitationally bound to the pbh , forming subsequently a density spike around it . in the second case ,",
    "if @xmath7 , such a pbh is formed already after the kinetic decoupling of dm particles , and there is no initial overdensity of radiation and dm around the pbh . in this case , the dm particles with low velocities also remain in finite orbits around the pbh , producing a density spike .",
    "thus , dm density spikes are formed around pbhs at the radiation - dominated stage .",
    "after the onset of the matter - dominated stage in the universe , the dm mass around pbhs begins to grow during the secondary accretion , and a universal density profile @xmath8 is formed .",
    "the dm density in the central regions of the spikes is so large that by now the dm particles have managed to annihilate ( under the assumption that standard neutralinos constitute the dm ) at distances that exceed the gravitational pbh radii by several orders of magnitude .",
    "for this reason , to calculate the present - day density profile around pbhs , it will be sufficient for us to consider the phenomena at great distances from the pbhs , where newtonian gravitational dynamics is a good approximation and the general relativity effects are unimportant .",
    "the dm remaining at great distances continues to annihilate at present , producing signals in gamma - ray emission .",
    "comparison of the calculated signals with the fermi - lat data allows the number of pbhs to be constrained .",
    "the annihilation of dm particles in clumps around pbhs has already been considered in @xcite , where constraints on the cosmological pbh density parameter were obtained .",
    "calculations @xcite and @xcite assumed the density profile in the central region of a clump to be close to @xmath9 , while @xcite considered power - law profiles @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to calculate the density profile in the central region of dm clumps around pbhs by taking into account the initial thermal velocity distribution of dm particles after their kinetic decoupling .",
    "we will show that the density profile has a more complex form than @xmath10 .",
    "knowledge of the density profile allows one to calculate the signals from dm annihilation around pbhs more reliably and to obtain constraints on the number of pbhs in the universe .",
    "consider the pbh formation at the radiation - dominated cosmological stage @xcite , when the equation of state for the matter in the universe is @xmath12 . a thermalized mixture of photons and ultrarelativistic particles called radiation for short collapses into a pbh .",
    "if nonrelativistic dm particles are already present at this time in the universe , then they move in the overall gravitational potential and , in addition , can interact with radiation . as an example , consider dm particles in the form of neutralinos with masses @xmath13  gev . at early times ,",
    "when the temperature was high , @xmath14 , neutralinos were in chemical equilibrium with radiation , i.e. , the production of neutralinos and their pair annihilation were equiprobable . as the universe cooled down , neutralinos dropped out of chemical equilibrium with radiation but still continued to efficiently interact with it through scatterings .",
    "the neutralino gas temperature was maintained at the radiation temperature level , and neutralinos could be entrained by radiation flows , for example , by the flow toward an accreting pbh .",
    "finally , on further cooling of the radiation to some temperature @xmath15 , whose value depends on the character of elementary interactions , the kinetic decoupling of dm particles from the radiation occurs at the time @xmath16 , and the dm particles subsequently move freely only under the influence of gravitational forces .",
    "we will find the fraction of the dm particles that remain gravitationally bound to the pbh ( have finite orbits ) as they fly apart in the next section , while first it is necessary to discuss the initial dm density profile around the pbh before kinetic decoupling .",
    "the mechanism for the formation of a dm density spike depends on the relation between the formation time of the pbh determined by its mass and the time @xmath16 dependent on the character of interaction between dm particles and radiation .",
    "the pbh in some perturbed region is formed at the instant @xmath17 this region crosses the cosmological horizon , which depends on the total mass @xmath18 of the matter inside this region : @xmath19 we take into account the fact that the mass @xmath3 of the forming pbh in the model of @xcite is @xmath20 .",
    "the age of the universe is related to the radiation temperature as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of degrees of freedom ; therefore , the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath23 at @xmath17 is @xmath24 the normalization factor in ( [ mbhtbig ] ) is chosen to correspond to the temperature of the kinetic decoupling of neutralinos with masses @xmath13  gev @xcite @xmath25 which occurs at a time @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the supersymmetry parameter @xcite .",
    "thus , the mass of @xmath28 given by eq .",
    "( [ mbhtbig ] ) is a boundary value .",
    "if @xmath29 , then the kinetic decoupling of neutralinos occurs already after the pbh formation , while the radiation flow accreted onto the pbh entrained dm particles from the pbh formation time to @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath7 , then the neutralinos at the pbh formation time were free and moved independently from the radiation .",
    "the radiation could outflow from some region of space , while the dm remained in this region .",
    "consider the case of @xmath29 .",
    "we can single out the near zone bounded by the radius of influence of the pbh @xmath30 in which the pbh mass is equal to the radiation mass@xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "hence @xmath33 in dimensionless units , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the gravitational pbh radius .",
    "we see that the pbh influence becomes relatively strong at low masses @xmath3 and long times @xmath36 .",
    "the dm mass within the radius of influence is @xmath37 where @xmath38  s is the transition time of the universe from the radiation - dominated cosmological stage to the dust - like stage . in the region of influence",
    "the particles move in the pbh gravitational field , while outside the region of influence the cosmological expansion continues , though , of course , this separation is approximate and , in reality , there is a transition region .",
    "note that the radius of the cosmological horizon at the radiation - dominated stage @xmath39 is close to the radius of influence @xmath40 only near the pbh formation time , while later @xmath39 expands faster than @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , all of the processes we consider occur on scales much smaller than the size of the cosmological horizon .",
    "the density distribution around a pbh could be accurately calculated through numerical hydrodynamic simulations similar to the simulations of pbh formation @xcite . however ,",
    "if the phenomena are considered not in the immediate vicinity of the pbh formation time but some time after , when the wave processes will damp out , then the approximation of quasi - stationary accretion can be used @xcite . before the recombination epoch",
    ", photons are often scattered by baryons and are thermalized .",
    "this leads to two effects .",
    "first , a bulk flow velocity toward the pbh appears in such a continuous medium , though individual photons are not captured by the pbh .",
    "second , although the expansion in the near zone is not the friedmann one , partial density equalization near the pbh and at great distances occurs due to the existence of a high pressure .",
    "the radiation density near the pbh is largely determined by the density at great distances , while the local density growth near the pbh driven by its gravity is smoothed out strongly .",
    "equalization must occur at distances from the pbh smaller than the sound horizon @xmath41 , which is close in order of magnitude to the cosmological horizon . at these distances",

    "this quantity is much smaller than the dm particle velocities that we will consider below .",
    "thus , in the newtonian region @xmath53 before the kinetic decoupling of dm particles , the density growth and the velocity anisotropy may be neglected . in contrast , in the case of @xmath7 , the pbh is formed already after kinetic decoupling , and the dm density distribution is not related to the radiation density growth around the pbh even in the near zone .",
    "consider the diffusive outflow of photons from a region of enhanced density , the silk effect ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which leads to an additional smoothing of the radiation and dm mass excess around the pbh before kinetic decoupling .",

    "therefore , the density at smaller radii must be considered as an estimate . in the next section",
    ", we will show that the density in the central region of the halo plays no role , because the dm in the central spikes has strongly annihilated by now and the density has decreased by several orders of magnitude .",
    "if the dm particles are able to annihilate , then their density will decrease with time .",
    "as was shown in @xcite and @xcite , the maximum dm density in a particular object at the present time does not exceed @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the time elapsed since the formation of the object . the thermal production cross section for dm particles in the early universe",
    "@xmath116  @xmath117  s@xmath118 is taken as a normalization for the annihilation cross section ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it follows from fig .",
    "[ grdeniteq ] that the density of the dm halo for all of the pbh masses considered at small radii exceeds considerably ( [ annwr ] ) .",
    "this means that the dense central regions of the halo existed only at early epochs , while by now the dm density in the halos around pbhs has decreased to ( [ annwr ] ) .",
    "an accurate calculation of the law of decrease in central density due to particle annihilation is a more complicated problem that is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "particles with different orbital parameters annihilate at each point of the density spike .",
    "therefore , a self - consistent allowance for the decrease in dm density simultaneously in all regions of the density spike is needed for the calculation .",
    "such a calculation is planned to be performed in future works . at early times , the annihilation - generated gamma - ray emission experienced absorption and thermalization in the cosmic plasma .",
    "the annihilation that continued during primordial nucleosynthesis or at the reionization epoch of the universe could influence these processes , but the quantitative role of this influence requires a separate study .",
    "dm annihilation around pbhs is an additional factor that can lead to chemical anomalies in the baryonic halos around pbhs considered by @xcite .",
    "thus , dm density spikes , from which halos with a central density @xmath119  g  @xmath120 and a decreasing density on the periphery have been left at present , existed around pbhs . the sizes of these halos are equal in order of magnitude to the radii of pbh influence given by eq .",

    "the density ( [ rhoihsa ] ) does not exceed the halo density at @xmath128 .",
