    "disk galaxy mergers are believed to be responsible for triggering a variety of global _ and _ nuclear responses in galaxies .",
    "the global effects have been well documented , both with observations , starting with zwicky s extensive work ( 1950 , 1956 , 1964 ) , and with numerical simulations , first convincingly demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "work during the last decades strongly suggests that a fraction of elliptical galaxies has formed as a result of disk galaxy merging ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the morphology of tidal tails has been used to trace the mass distribution in galactic halos @xcite , and the tails themselves are possible birthplaces of some dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "mergers have also been closely connected to luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most dramatic physical process associated with disk galaxy merging is the inflow of gas into the nuclear region and the consequent excitation of nuclear starburst and agn activity .",
    "this process has been reported from simulations @xcite and from observations @xcite . whether the gas `` hangs up '' and forms stars in the inner kiloparsec , or continues to flow inward towards a putative agn , has a strong impact on the luminosity and evolution of the merger .",
    "the details of the nuclear gasdynamics will depend on the structure of the host galaxies and the dynamical stage of the interaction @xcite .",
    "several scenarios have been suggested in which interactions evolve from starburst - dominated to agn - dominated regimes as the galaxies merge @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , until now , both observations and numerical simulations have lacked the spatial resolution needed to study the evolution of the merging nuclei on scales smaller than a few hundred parsecs .",
    "for this reason , our understanding of how mergers fuel nuclear starburst and agn activity , and drive galaxy evolution from the nucleus out , has remained woefully incomplete .",
    "theoretical arguments suggest that the evolution of the merging nuclei is where the merger hypothesis for the formation of elliptical galaxies through disk galaxy mergers faces its most stringent test .",
    "a wide variety of physical processes may shape the nuclei .",
    "purely stellar dynamical merging alone would tend to produce diffuse nuclei with large cores and a very shallow nuclear surface brightness gradient @xcite unless the progenitor nuclei were dense @xcite . in the case of gas - rich disk galaxies",
    ", the dissipative flow of gas into the nuclei and accompanying star formation would tend to result in a steep luminosity profile @xcite and a large central density , as seen in several young merger remnants ( r. p. van der marel et al .",
    ", in preparation ; see also figure 2 in @xcite @xcite ) . the presence of a central supermassive black hole would also induce a strong nuclear power - law cusp @xcite . yet",
    "if both galaxies contain supermassive central black holes which merge , the resulting black hole binary would act as a dynamical slingshot and eject stars from the center , thus lowering the stellar density there @xcite .",
    "for these reasons we are undertaking a high resolution _",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ survey of the nuclear regions in a sequence of merging galaxies .",
    "the questions we want to answer include the following : 1 . what is the morphology of the ionized gas distribution around the nucleus ?",
    "is it clumpy , diffuse and extended , ring - like , or compact and disk - like ? does this morphology depend on the interaction stage ?",
    "how is the current star formation , as revealed by the h@xmath0 line emission , distributed with respect to the young stellar populations as revealed by their blue color ( and , eventually , spectra ) ?",
    "3 . how do the nuclear starbursts affect the radial color gradients of the merger remnants ?",
    "the spatial resolution of the _ hst _",
    "( 1050 pc in nearby systems ) is required to investigate these questions , which are the focus of the current paper . in future papers",
    ", we will study the stellar populations , kinematics , and evolution of the merger - induced starbursts of the toomre sequence nuclei , using _",
    "hst _ stis spectra and nicmos imaging .",
    "the toomre sequence @xcite is a sample of 11 relatively nearby ( within @xmath1120mpc ) interacting and merging disk galaxies , which have been arranged into a sequence according to the _ putative _ time before or since merging .",
    "these systems were chosen because they exhibit conspicuous tidal tails and `` main bodies that are nearly in contact or perhaps not even separable '' @xcite .",
    "they span a range of dynamical phases , from galaxies early in the merging process ( e.g. , ngc4038/39 and ngc4676 ) to late - stage merger remnants ( e.g. , ngc3921 and ngc7252 ; see figure  [ f : mosaic ] and table  [ t : sample ] ) .",
    "we want to emphasize the word `` putative '' , since the placing of a system in this sequence was based on the apparent degree of coalescence of the progenitor main bodies in low - resolution optical photographical plates , assuming that the progenitors resembled normal disk galaxies in the pre - encounter stage .",
    "because of the requirement of well - developed tidal tails , these systems have suffered , or are suffering , encounters that are most likely of prograde sense ( with the disks rotating in the same sense as they orbit each other ) .",
    "in such a scenario , the orbits of interacting galaxies decay as the galaxies lose orbital energy and angular momentum via dynamical friction with their dark halos . ultimately , the galaxies coalesce and form a single merger remnant . on these grounds",
    "we can call the toomre sequence an evolutionary sequence . because it is an _ optically _",
    "selected sample of merging galaxies , it suffers less from dust obscuration than infrared - luminous samples , allowing the nuclei to be studied at optical wavelengths .",
    "the toomre sequence has been widely investigated by ground - based observations @xcite , space - based observations @xcite , and numerical studies @xcite .",

    "we employed the stsdas task wfixup to interpolate ( in the x - direction ) over bad pixels as identified in the data quality files .",
    "we also used the stsdas task warmpix to correct consistently warm pixels in the data , using the most recent warm pixel tables .",
    "the stsdas task crrej was used to combine the two 160 second exposures .",
    "this step corrects most of the pixels affected by cosmic rays in the combined image . in general , a few cosmic rays remain uncorrected , mostly when the same pixel was hit in both exposures .",
    "also , a small number of hot pixels remain uncorrected because they are not listed even in the most recent warm pixel tables .",
    "we corrected these with the iraf task cosmicrays , setting the `` threshold '' and `` fluxratio '' parameters to values selected by a careful comparison of the images before and after correction , to ensure that only questionable pixels were replaced .",
    "the rest of the reduction was done with the standard wfpc2 pipeline tasks using the best reference files available .",
    "the lrf exposures were flat - fielded using the narrow - band f656n and f673n ( whichever was closer in wavelength ) flat fields .",
    "we also created mosaiced f555w and f814w images with the iraf / stsdas task wmosaic .",

    "the photometric calibration , and conversion to johnson @xmath6- and @xmath7-bands was performed according to guidelines in @xcite .",
    "a @xmath10-correction has not been applied to any of our measurements . since the throughput of the narrow - band filters does not vary much at the wavelengths of the lines , it was possible to calibrate the line fluxes by assuming zero width for the lines ( monochromatic ) .",
    "we used the iraf / stsdas synphot task bandpar to compute the conversion from counts  sec@xmath4 to ergs  sec@xmath4  @xmath11 .",
    "the results were the same within errors to those produced by the synphot task calcpar .    using the known relative orientation of the various chips on wfpc2 , we rotated the chips which contained the line emission and the pc - chip @xmath6 and @xmath7 images to the same orientation .",
    "we used stars in the images to register the frames .",
    "the final emission - line images were constructed by accounting for the different scales of images on various chips ( usually the pc chip and wf2 chip ) , and scaling down the @xmath6- and @xmath7-band images to the expected count levels corresponding to the wavelength and band of the line image , with the help of the wfpc2 exposure time calculator .",
    "we then combined the broad - band images by taking their geometric mean and performed a final adjustment to this combined continuum image by selecting areas well outside emission - line regions ( with pure stellar emission ) and comparing fluxes in corresponding areas in the continuum and line images .",
    "finally , we subtracted the scaled continuum image from the line image .",
    "using the combination of @xmath6 and @xmath7 images eliminates the extinction terms in the case of foreground extinction , as explained in detail by @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "the residual image shows negative pixels , which are most likely due to strong color gradients near the nuclei .",
    "we estimate that the final uncertainty in the line fluxes is no better than 50% , based on varying the scaling of the continuum image within acceptable limits and comparing the derived total line fluxes .",
    "color index images were created by dividing the f555w image by the f814w image , taking the logarithm of the result , and correcting for differences in the color terms , using the synthetic calibration from @xcite . for our new imagery ( i.e. , all systems except ngc 4038/39 , ngc 3921 , and ngc 7252 ) , many regions in the raw color index images are of low signal - to - noise .",
    "we therefore constructed smoothed color index maps using an adaptive filtering procedure , as described by @xcite , where areas with lower signal - to - noise ratios were smoothed by a larger boxcar .",
    "these images were then masked so as to only show areas with adequate signal - to - noise ( signal - to - noise greater than two in both @xmath6- and @xmath7-images after being smoothed with an 11@xmath911 pixel boxcar median filter ) .",
    "the resulting smoothed color index images , together with the unsmoothed broad - band images and h@xmath0 + [ ] images , are shown in figures  [ f : n4038][f : n7252 ] .",
    "in the following we give a brief description of each system , based on figures  [ f : n4038][f : n7252 ] , together with a few references to earlier work .",
    "we use a hubble constant of @xmath12 throughout this paper .",
    "perhaps the best - known system in the sequence is the antennae .",

    "these images show the chaotic dust lanes and prevalent star formation in the interface between the two galaxies .",
    "they also reveal the redder color of the underlying population in the bulge component of each galaxy .",
    "the focus of the @xcite papers was on the abundant young star clusters which have apparently formed as the result of the interaction of the two galaxies .",

    "the extremely blue colors of this region ( @xmath14 colors around 0.5 ; the tip of this region is seen at the bottom center of figure  [ f : n3509 ] ) are in spectacular contrast to the rest of the galaxy ( typical @xmath14 values from 1.1 to 1.4 ) , and indicate active star formation .    in our images we can clearly identify a single relatively undisturbed nucleus , surrounded by a swirl of dust lanes ( center of figure  [ f : n3509 ] ) .",

    "dust extinction is at least partly responsible for this effect .",
    "@xcite noticed that the nucleus lies substantially off - centered from the outer stellar isophotes of the main body .",
    "we use the _ hst _ @xmath6 and @xmath7 images from @xcite to study the most advanced merger in the toomre sequence .",
    "the remnant from the merger is probably between 0.5 and 1 gyrs old @xcite .",
    "it has a single nucleus and is characterized by a @xmath27 profile typical of elliptical galaxies @xcite .",

    "_ h@xmath0 image of this galaxy shows the disk to be actively forming stars , while the @xmath14 color map shows dust to be intertwined between the arms . in light of the results from recent hydrodynamical simulations @xcite , and the observation of tidal gas streaming back into the central regions of this remnant from the tidal tails @xcite , it seems likely that this central disk structure results from the re - accretion of tidally raised gas into the now - relaxed central potential .",
    "the nucleus appears resolved , and is very bright , as we show in section  [ s : mergerstage ] .",
    "h@xmath0 emission largely follows the spiral arms , although there appears to be a central h@xmath0 source as well .",
    "however , our continuum subtraction , unfortunately , is uncertain in this area due to an optically very bright nucleus .",
    "similarly , the central @xmath14 color is difficult to determine reliably due to the same problem , but the color there appears to be close to 1.3 , whereas the surrounding spirals have @xmath14 colors as blue as 0.5 .        recent x - ray observations with asca revealed x - ray emission that can be described by a two - component model @xcite , with soft emission ( kt = 0.72 kev ) , and a hard component ( kt @xmath28 5.1 kev ) .",
    "the hard component might indicate the existence of nuclear activity or even an intermediate mass black hole .",
    "we performed aperture photometry of the toomre sequence galaxies to better understand the evolution of the nuclear region of merging galaxies . because the isophotes in the nuclear region of merging galaxies are highly twisted , we did not attempt to fit ellipses and obtain radial surface brightness profiles .",
    "instead we performed aperture photometry within circular apertures , with radii of 100 pc and 1 kpc .",
    "the lower value was dictated by the smallest resolvable physical scale in the most distant of our sample galaxies , whereas the upper value is somewhat arbitrary , but set because of our emphasis on the properties of the nuclear region .",
    "we have already characterized the morphology of the nuclear region at _ hst _ resolution in the individual galaxies above .",
    "here we only report on the bulk photometric nuclear properties of each identified merger component galaxy .",
    "visual inspection of the images quickly reveals that none of the galaxies in the sample possess an extremely bright , point - like active nucleus .",
    "based on spectroscopic evidence , as cited in section  [ s : images ] , the only mildly active nuclei are in ngc7592a ( seyfert 2 ) , ngc4676 nuc  1 and nuc  2 ( liner ) , ngc2623 ( liner ) , and ngc3921 ( liner ) .",
    "it is difficult to assess what the exact contribution of the nucleus to the integrated luminosities is .",
    "the photometric measurements , converted to luminosity densities , are presented in figures  [ f : iphot][f : haphot ] .",
    "the `` merger stage '' , plotted along the x - axis , refers to the original order of the sequence given by @xcite , where 1 corresponds to ngc4038/39 ( the earliest merger stage ) and 11 to ngc7252 ( the latest merger stage ) .",
    "the exact correspondence is given in the figure caption to figure  [ f : iphot ] .",
    "our observations do not suggest an obvious reordering of this sequence , although we are hampered by our inability to unambiguously identify all of the putative nuclei .",
    "our tentative impression is that ngc7764a ( merger stage=4 ) may be interacting with the disturbed galaxy lying off of our image , in which case it belongs near the beginning of the sequence .",
    "and ngc3509 ( merger stage=6 ) is not an obvious merger at all .",
    "however , we will await nicmos observations of this sequence before reaching any firm conclusions on this matter .",
    "we note that none of our conclusions will be affected if these two systems move earlier along or off of the sequence .",
    "apart from the large scatter in figure  [ f : iphot ] we see that the three latest merger stage systems ( ngc3256 , ngc3921 , and ngc7252 ) have the highest intrinsic luminosity densities .",
    "this is true for both apertures that we used ( 100 pc and 1 kpc ) .",
    "the range of luminosity density within 100 pc corresponds to a factor of more than 300 . to a large extent",
    "this reflects the varying dust extinction in the central region , but partly also the morphology of the nuclear region ( well - defined nuclei are bright , whereas components with no clearly recognizable nucleus are faint ) . with only @xmath14 colors available",
    "it is difficult to make a meaningful estimate of dust extinction .",
    "but , for example , figure  [ f : viphot ] shows that in ngc  2623 the integrated @xmath14 color is very red within a 100 pc radius aperture , with a value around 2.2 . assuming that the true @xmath14 color is 1.4 ( a more typical value seen in the same figure ) , would imply almost @xmath29 = 2 mag of extinction with a typical extinction law of a@xmath30 @xcite . since the extinction in the @xmath10-band is only one tenth of that in the @xmath6-band ,",
    "our future nicmos images offer some hope of revealing the true location of the nucleus .    while the @xmath14 colors for the 100  pc aperture attain values anywhere between 0.8 and 2.4 , the majority of the nuclei have rather typical colors for the centers of spiral nuclei and elliptical galaxies , ranging from 1.2 to 1.5 ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the presumably latest stage merger , ngc7252 , has colors even bluer than normal ellipticals .",
    "however , the morphology of the dust lanes we see in the images suggests that dust obscuration is likely to be significant in many systems of the toomre sequence .",
    "the h@xmath0 + [ ] luminosities ( figure  [ f : haphot ] ) show a marginal trend of increasing luminosities towards the late - stage mergers , most obviously in the largest 1  kpc aperture . however , the scatter is large , and based on the sample of 15 nuclei it is impossible to establish any definite trends .",
    "since mergers are expected to bring material into the center of galaxies and generate star formation there , we also study the nuclear concentration of light and line emission along the merging sequence .",
    "we measure the nuclear concentration quantitatively by taking the ratio of the luminosities within 100 pc to that within 1 kpc , for both the @xmath7-band ( figure  [ f : irat ] ) and the line emission ( figure  [ f : harat ] ) .",
    "we discuss the meaning of these ratios briefly in the following section .",
    "the nuclear morphologies and central concentration are expected to be strongly affected by the timing and intensity of induced inflows and star formation during the merger .",
    "numerical models of interacting galaxies have illustrated one mechanism by which interactions trigger these inflows and nuclear activity . shortly after the galaxies first collide",
    ", the self - gravity of each disk amplifies the collisional perturbation into a growing @xmath31 mode @xcite . depending on the structural properties of each galaxy",
    ", this mode can take the form of a strong bar , prominent spiral arms , or a pronounced oval distortion @xcite .",
    "these non - axisymmetric structures drive shocks in the interstellar medium of the galaxies , leading to a spatial offset between the gaseous and stellar components which robs the gas of angular momentum , and can drive it inwards well before the galaxies ultimately merge @xcite .",
    "the onset , strength , and duration of starbursts in interacting pairs can vary widely , depending on the properties of the host galaxies .",
    "ultimately , however , any dynamical stability provided by the presence of a central bulge or diminished disk surface density will be overwhelmed by the strong gravitational torques and dissipative shocks during the final merging of the pair , at which point gaseous inflow and central activity should be ubiquitous .",
    "once the coalescence of the galaxies is complete , the gravitational potential settles down and gas can resettle into nuclear and/or spatially extended disks , supporting an extended period of relatively quiescent star formation .",
    "based on these kinds of models , we might expect to see an evolutionary trend for the nuclear properties of the toomre sequence , from quiescent star formation in the early stages of the sequence to strong nuclear activity in the late stages .",
    "however , we see little evidence for such trends in the morphology , luminosity density , or colors of the stellar component , or in the morphology or intensity of the ionized gas emission , apart possibly from the fact that the latest - stage systems have some of the highest broad - band luminosity densities and hints of starbursting central gaseous disk structures .",
    "this last suggestion is further strengthened by the trend towards bluer colors among the three latest - stage merger systems in figure  [ f : viphot ] . a trend towards bluer colors",
    "was also seen in a study of merger remnants by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the latest - stage merger systems have some of the highest nuclear h@xmath0 luminosities ( figure  [ f : haphot ] ) and possess some of the largest concentrations of light in the central region ( figure  [ f : irat ] ) .",
    "such a concentration is also seen to a certain extent in the h@xmath0 + [ ] emission ( figure  [ f : harat ] ) .",
    "are our observations of the toomre nuclei consistent with the broad picture of interaction - induced nuclear activity in galaxies evidenced in numerical simulations ? in a broad sense , yes , although this consistency is mainly due to the variety of dynamical responses available to interacting systems .",
    "the late stage mergers seem to have settled down , showing evidence for nuclear emission - line disks ( ngc2623 , ngc3256 , ngc3921 , and ngc7252 ) , more concentrated luminosity profiles and a trend towards bluer colors .",
    "toomre sequence objects at earlier stages show very diverse properties , with no clear trends along the sequence .",
    "however , selecting a merging sequence based largely on the large - scale morphology of the tidal tails biases the sample towards a specific type of interaction  prograde interactions between disk galaxies  but not a specific type of disk galaxy .",
    "the galaxies which make up the toomre sequence likely possess a variety of structural properties so that there is no one - to - one correspondence between observed merger stage and nuclear morphology and activity .",
    "put differently , the toomre sequence is _ not _ a true evolutionary sequence on anything but the largest scales .",
    "instead , it is composed of a variety of galaxies progressing down varied paths of interaction - driven activity . expecting to discern",
    "a clear trend in nuclear properties is likely a naive hope .      aside from the variety of physical conditions sampled by the toomre nuclei , searching for trends along the toomre sequence",
    "is also hampered by a number of observational concerns .",
    "first , the orientation of the galaxies with respect to the line - of - sight and to the orbital plane of the merger complicates the interpretation of the images .",
    "second , extinction has a large effect on the observed morphologies , colors , and luminosities , as shown in section  [ s : mergerstage ] ( e.g. , ngc520 nuc  1 and ngc4676 nuc  1 ) . in this context",
    ", we hope to improve upon the interpretation of the galaxy morphologies along the sequence through an analysis of nicmos images of the entire toomre sequence",
    ". these images will suffer from much less extinction , and should also reveal the isophotes of the stellar population more clearly , thereby helping us in assessing the inclination of the merger components .",
    "the optical images shown here clearly demonstrate that dust in merging galaxies , even on small scales resolved by the _ hst _",
    ", is not patchy enough to enable the identification of the true nuclei in optical bands .          in summary ,",
    "these high - resolution wfpc2 images of the toomre sequence have given us a detailed view of the nuclear regions of interacting and merging galaxies .",
    "we have characterized the broad - band and emission - line morphologies of each member of the sequence , and measured the colors and luminosity densities of the nuclei .",
    "we find little evidence for clear trends in nuclear properties along the merger sequence , other than a suggestive rise in the nuclear luminosity density in the most evolved members of the sequence .",
    "the lack of clear trends in nuclear properties is likely due both to the effects of obscuration and geometry , as well as the physical variety of galaxies involved in the toomre sequence . in subsequent papers",
