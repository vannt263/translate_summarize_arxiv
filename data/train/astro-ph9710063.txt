    "our present understanding of the phenomenon of grbs is based on the foundations laid by cavallo & rees ( 1978 ) , goodman ( 1986 ) , paczynski ( 1986 ) , eichler et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , shemi & piran ( 1990 ) and several other works .",
    "however , as far as the origin of actually observed nonthermal and highly complex spectra are concerned , we are indebted to another important idea ( rees & meszaros 1992 , meszaros & rees 1993 ) that cosmic fbs with appreciable pollution of baryonic mass , i.e. , with a value of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 has been defined in the abstract , could be a virtue rather than being a problem .",
    "most of our current efforts to understand the phenomenology of grbs largely hinge on this above mentioned framework .",
    "meszaros & rees ( 1993 ) suggested that the duration of the burst should be @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the so - called deceleration radius measured in the lab frame . at @xmath13 ,",
    "the fb is supposed to transmit half of its original momentum to the medium .",
    "the baryon polluted fb is expected to drive a strong forward shock ( or a blast wave ) in the ambient medium , presumably the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and at @xmath14 , the blast wave is assumed to be sufficiently strong as the fb transfers half of its momentum to it .",
    "technically , we can define another distance , namely , @xmath15 , where either the blast wave or the reverse shock becomes sufficiently radiative as far as hard x - ray and gamma ray ( i.e. , the main component of the observed grbs ) productions are concerned",
    ". the value of @xmath15 will be highly model dependent and contains all the microphysics of the process , and strictly speaking , there may not be any simple correlation between the values of @xmath12 ( largely a simpler hydrodynamic definition ) and @xmath15 ( a highly model dependent definition ) .",
    "we want to emphasize here that the basic definition of @xmath16 should naturally involve @xmath15 and not @xmath12 .",
    "unfortunately , the present status of the studies on grb is quite preliminary , and , it is not possible to unambiguosly define the value of @xmath15 even for a relatively simple model .",
    "in this situation , practically , all the authors tacitly assume that @xmath17 .",
    "since the present paper endeavours to analyze the question of the gross time scale in the context of the existing framework of hydrodynamical model of grbs we will also use the condition @xmath18 although we will try to retain the physical distinction between @xmath15 and @xmath12 as far as possible .",
    "however , following the same basic framework , katz ( 1994 , see his eqn .",
    "23 ) finds that for a fb propagating in a dense ambient medium ( which could be a molecular cloud ) , we should have @xmath19 .",
    "similarly , piran ( 1994 ) also concludes that @xmath19 ( see his eqn .",
    "although , in a subsequent paper ( sari & piran 1995 ) , the question of hydrodynamical timescales and temporal structure of grbs has been discussed with considerable detail , we feel that the aspect of the gross overall duration has not been answered in an umambiguous manner .",
    "this foregoing work , in particular , laid specific emphasis on the temporal structure of the grbs associated with the occurrence of the newtonian , or , subsequently , relativistic , reverse shock which is supposed to propagate inside the fb . on the other hand , we would discuss that , if the fireball ( fb ) actually becomes radiative at the deceleration radius ( where it loses half of its initial momentum and kinetic energy to the ambient medium ) , the likely evolution of the reverse shock from a newtonian one to a fully relativistic one ( at @xmath20 ) could be of somewhat academic interest .",
    "however , in case the blastwave fails to become radiative at @xmath21 for some reason or another , the considerations due to sari & piran ( 1995 ) may become applicable to the actual cases . here",
    "again , one has to address the question of the overall gross duration of the bursts .    to fully appreciate the origin of this dilemma and its resolution",
    ", we would revisit the concept of duration of pulses emitted by a fb propagating in a vacuum .",
    "for the sake of clarity , we would use the following nomenclature : @xmath22 the instantaneous bulk lorentz factor ( lf ) of _ any _ fluid emitting the radiation and @xmath23 the instantaneous bulk lf of the fb .",
    "thus @xmath24 is a general nomenclature applicable to both the original fb ( in a vacuum ) or any section of the shocked fluid ( in a medium ) which might be emitting radiation whereas @xmath25 specifically refers to the fb .",
    "note that , the shock can not be sufficiently strong unless @xmath26 .",
    "we would see that , in case the grb eventually results from a shock which becomes sufficiently strong as well as radiative at @xmath27 , as envisaged by meszaros & rees , we should have @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , which means that in the meszaros & rees scheme , the actual duration of the bursts should be at least one order higher than what has been contemplated so far ( for a fixed @xmath10 ) . we would also try to point out that as long as the blast wave can be considered sufficiently radiative , for estimating the eventual duration of the burst , the reverse shock plays an insignificant role .",
    "when a fb propagates in a vacuum , we have @xmath30 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the radiation emitted by the spherically expanding fb with that of a relativistically moving point source showing apparent superluminal ( transverse ) motion ( rees 1966 ) :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the angle between the line of sight and the direction of motion .",
    "we may obtain @xmath35 in some circumstances essentially because the source of radiation moves with a speed @xmath36 , and tends to catch up with the radiation emitted by itself .",
    "this phenomenon occurs because the velocity of propagation of the radiation from the fast moving source remains fixed at @xmath37 and does not increase in a galilean fashion .",
    "the same relativistic phenomenon is actually responsible for offering a value of @xmath16 much shorter than the expected non - relativistic value @xmath38 .",
    "nevertheless , for considering the ( apparent ) time seen by the observer , we have to consider the line of sight velocity of the fb rather than the tranverse velocity :    @xmath39    for the exact point of the fb intersected by the line of sight , i.e. for @xmath40 , one can see that @xmath41 for @xmath42 . hence @xmath43 .",
    "however , the observer receives light not only from a given point but also from other parts of the fb .",
    "because of relativistic aberration , the angular extent of the region is limited to @xmath44 in the lab frame . then we have    @xmath45    here it is assumed that @xmath46 , the initial radius of the fb .",
    "initially the fb could be non - relativistic and in case it could manange to send radiation outside ( actually it would be extremely optically thick ) , the duration of the burst would have been @xmath47 . if the explosive energy is liberated not instantaneously , but over a tiny but finite time - scale , the impulsive approximation is correct as long as the expected @xmath48 .",
    "if the fb really becomes optically thin , i.e. , the thomson scattering optical depth of the fb fluid becomes @xmath49 at @xmath50 , most of the radiation escapes out over a distance @xmath51 , and we would have @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the bulk lorentz factor of the fb at this point .",
    "dynamics of the fb shows that from the initial non - relativistic phase , the fb becomes quickly relativistic and @xmath54 , and @xmath55 when @xmath56 , and then the fb coasts freely with @xmath57 ( piran , shemi & narayanan 1993 , meszaros , laguna , & rees 1993 ) . for a wide range of parameters of cosmic fbs",
    ", it also follows that @xmath58 , so that @xmath59 . at the same time , the observed duration of the burst can not be smaller than @xmath60 . therefore , for the sake of consistency , we will have @xmath61 if @xmath62 and @xmath63 otherwise .",
    "this exercise suggests that , in the lab frame , the fb appears as a narrow shell of width @xmath64 ( if @xmath65 ) . the doppler factor associated with the superluminal motion is @xmath66^{-1 } $ ] and",
    "the the comoving duration of the pulse is ( see eq .",
    "2 )    @xmath67    of course , this result could have been obtained directly by considering the lorentz contraction of the length @xmath68 in the fluid frame . for the baryon",
    "polluted fbs with @xmath69 , the escape of radiation at @xmath70 is only of pedagogic importance because only an insignificant fraction of the fb energy @xmath71 is available in the form of fb radiation at @xmath72 .",
    "almost the entire energy of the fb gets channelized into the bulk kinetic energy of the baryons and which can not radiate efficiently in vacuum ( shemi & piran 1990 ) .",
    "meszaros & rees ( 1993 ) pointed out that the baryonic fb should sweep the ambient ism and drive a strong forward shock . in principle",
    ", this blast wave may be radiating all the time , but the rate of radiation can not be substantial unless appreciable amount of the fb momentum and energy have been transmitted to the medium and the shock becomes radiative at @xmath73 .",
    "it is also likely that the fb radiates considerable amount of energy in non - thermal gamma rays even before @xmath73 owing to the existence of internal shocks ( rees & meszaros 1994 ) .",
    "however , we implicitly assume here that the fraction of initial energy lost in this way would be @xmath74",
    ".    we can simplify the bf - shock configuration by a one dimensional sketch following katz ( 1994 ) and piran ( 1994 ) ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the region ( 4 ) represents the unperturbed fb whose original edge @xmath75 is the contact discontinuity between the piston driving the shock and the unperturbed ism ( 1 ) .",
    "the region ( 2 ) is the perturbed and squeezed - shocked ism whereas region ( 3 ) is the perturbed and reverse - shocked fb .",
    "let @xmath76 denote the proper enthalpy density for each region ( with appropriate subscript ) where @xmath77 denotes the proper internal energy density and @xmath78 represents the pressure .",
    "again , some clarifications about the nomenclatures would be in order here .",
    "a subscript to the quantities such as @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 will represent respective proper values in a given region , i.e. @xmath80 will represent internal energy density of region 1 .",
    "in contrast , since , lfs are always meaningful with respect to a certain inertial frame , @xmath81 will represent the value of lf of the region 2 with respect to the region 1 and _ vice - versa_. since , now _ the radiation is emitted not by the fb but by the shocked fluid in the region ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) with a lab frame bulk lf of @xmath82 _ ( the lab frame being the ism at rest [ 1 ] ) _ it is the value of @xmath83 rather than @xmath84 which now determines the value of @xmath16_. and it is here that the value of @xmath16 _ bifurcates between @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the literature_. therefore , we must unambiguously find the value of @xmath87 in terms of @xmath88 to settle this issue . here",
    "it may also be emphasized that at least for the 1-d simplification employed by us the lab frame lf of the reverse - shocked fluid in region ( 3 ) is also @xmath87 though the lf of it with respect to the region ( 4 ) is @xmath89 could be very much different from @xmath90 .",
    "now we can recall the strong shock jump conditions from taub ( 1949 ) and blandford & mckee ( 1976 ) and apply the same at @xmath91 , the forward shock :    @xmath92    @xmath93    and ,    @xmath94 ^ 2 } \\over { \\gamma_{2 } ( 2 - \\gamma_2 ) ( \\gamma_{12 } - 1 ) + 2}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath95 is the lf of the interface @xmath91 between 1 and 2 . here",
    "@xmath96 is defined by the relation @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the rest mass density in the respective regions ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) . for a simple one - component fluid ,",
    "physically @xmath99 is just the ratio of specific heats , and has a value lying between @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we expect the ( forward ) shocked fluid to be highly compressed , heated and to be highly relativistic ( internal energy wise ) , so that , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "on the other hand , the region ( 1 ) , i.e. , the unperturbed ambient medium is assumed to be cold so that @xmath104 and @xmath105 , where @xmath106 stands for proton mass",
    ". then it promptly follows that    @xmath107    @xmath108    and , @xmath109    if we assume the surface of contact discontinuity to be at perfect pressure equilibrium then we will have @xmath110 , and , further , assuming the reverse - shocked fluid also to be highly relativistic ( as far as internal energy is concerned ) , i.e. , @xmath111 , we find @xmath112 . as to the region ( 4 ) , i.e. , the unshocked part of the fb , the baryons are assumed to be coasting freely after @xmath113 with a lf @xmath114 until they sacrifice considerable portion ( half at @xmath13 ) of their bulk energy to the shocked naterial .",
    "therefore , at @xmath115 , the fb material is also non - relativistic in its rest frame enabling us to write @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
    "this allows us to form another set of simplified jump conditions at @xmath118 :    @xmath119    and @xmath120 where @xmath121 and the lf of the interface between 3 and 4 @xmath122    the value of @xmath123 lies between 1 ( ultrarelativistic reverse flow , @xmath124 ) and 4 ( mildly relativistic reverse flow , @xmath125 ) .",
    "following piran ( 1994 ) , if we define @xmath126 , and utilize the fact that @xmath127 , we can eliminate @xmath128 from the foregoing equations to obtain    @xmath129    @xmath130    and @xmath131    katz ( 1994 ) has considered a case with @xmath132 , i.e. , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 to obtain @xmath135 .",
    "and thus he obtained @xmath136 .",
    "let us now try to see whether this consideration of @xmath137 is justified or not .",
    "as is well understood , each observer sees the fb within a solid angle of @xmath138 , and a spherical fb will appear as a collection of @xmath139 incoherent beamed fbs to as many observers distributed over @xmath140 solid angle .",
    "thus even for a fb with angular extent of @xmath141 , we can actually take care of considerable amount of anisotropic development .",
    "as long as a given ambient medium , which could be the background ism @xmath142 or a molecular cloud @xmath143 , has a linear width much larger than the length scales associated with the development and completion of the radiative processes associated with a grb event we can crudely consider the ambient medium to be uniform over a certain scale . since the value of @xmath1 is expected to be @xmath144 , and the associated solid angle , @xmath138 , is expected to be @xmath145 to @xmath146 steradian corresponding to @xmath147 , the linear scales in question are indeed much smaller than the typical cloud dimensions @xmath148 few pc , and thus , we should not be concerned with the probable different values of @xmath149 .",
    "given a certain fixed value of @xmath149 , we can now uniquely find the value of @xmath150 :    @xmath151    where the comoving width of the fb is @xmath152 . and since @xmath153",
    ", we obtain    @xmath154    now , we will have to confront the question : physically , which is the most appropriate definition for @xmath1 ?",
    "if the blast wave becomes radiative at @xmath13 , obviously , following meszaros and rees ( 1993 ) , the radiative radius @xmath15 should be the deceleration radius , @xmath12 .",
    "simple energy and momentum conservation consideration shows that at the deceleration radius , i.e. , the radius when half of the initial momentum gets transmitted , we have @xmath155 and the swept up mass @xmath156 .",
    "this yields    @xmath157    where @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "we can also contemplate as to which is the fundamental scale length ( apart from @xmath160 ) in this problem .",
    "could it be the `` sedov length '' @xmath161 where the fb sweeps a mass equal to @xmath162 ( sari & piran 1995 ) ? from a dynamical point of view",
    "the concept of momentum exchange is more meaningful than the concept of swept up mass and in a nonrelativistic snr case , the equality of swept up mass implies equal momentum sharing . therefore in a relativistic dynamical problem ( grb ) , it is the `` deceleration length '' which the physical equivalent to the idea of sedov length appearing in the supernova remnant ( snr ) theory . as we allow @xmath163 , we find , @xmath164 within a small numerical factor ! if the sedov length were indeed a basic length scale in this problem , there would be a basic time - scale @xmath165 - a time scale which is actually appropriate for the snr case and which may also be appropriate for low wavelength afterglow following the main grb .",
    "of course , it is probable that the shock actually may not be sufficiently radiative at @xmath13 , but it becomes so at a much later distance where the value of @xmath166 would be much lower than @xmath167 ( in a spherically symmetric 3-d geometry ) and the fb has swept an amount of mass much larger than @xmath168 because of a variety of reasons ( sari & piran 1995 ) . unless we have a specific prescription to describe the extent to which the fb is radiative , the problem becomes rather poorly defined in this case .",
    "the most important parameter describing the radiative maturity of the shock could be the _ in - situ _ magnetic field near the blast wave , and , almost for any model of enhanced magnetic field generation , the value of the magnetic field decreases at least linearly until the background ism value is achieved ( meszaros , rees , and & papathanssiou 1994 ) .",
    "therefore , _ it is highly unlikely that if the blast wave fails to become radiative at @xmath13 , it would be radiative at a much larger radius in the framework of a purely hydrodynamic model_. nevertheless , we would like point out here that this whole discussion explores the question of duration of the grb in the idealistic meszaros & rees framework which assumes that even in a sparse ism ( @xmath169 ) , the hydrodynamic limit is achieved at any radius .",
    "we have discussed elsewhere ( mitra 1996 ) that actually this framework may not be be valid at all when applied to a sparse ambient medium because because the mean free path of the leading particles of the blast wave ( @xmath170 ) is unlikely to satisfy the condition @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is the lab frame width of the fb .",
    "this would mean that the hydrodynamical limit may not at all be achieved at the expected value of @xmath21 and the fb may not transfer any appreciable amount of energy and momentum to the ambient medium .",
    "naturally , there may be no strong shock at all at @xmath173 ( mitra 1996 ) .",
    "in such a case , the fb may interact with the ambient medium in the fluid limit at a much larger distance @xmath174 and part of the discussion by sari & piran ( 1995 ) may be applicable in a surprisingly unexpected way .    for the time being",
    "we ignore such disturbing possibility and note that in any case , it is really not necessary for the emission of the gamma - rays that the reverse shock crosses the fb ; the blast wave may be radiative enough on its own though it may look for seed photons originating from any source including the reverse shock .",
    "then at @xmath175 , the foregoing equations lead to    @xmath176    therefore , we must have @xmath177 at the deceleration radius in the meszaros and rees scenario .",
    "now we can go back to eqn .",
    "( 17 - 22 ) to find that for @xmath13 , we have    @xmath178    and @xmath179    because of the uncertainty in the value of the bulk lf of the reverse shock material ( which we clearly find to be @xmath180 ) we are still not able to exactly fix the value of @xmath81 .",
    "however , we can do so by appealing to some simple physical facts .",
    "the first condition is a trivial one that we can not have the value of any lf , in particular , @xmath181 . and",
    "in order that there is a forward shock at all , we must have @xmath182 .",
    "finally , there will be no reverse shock if @xmath183 .",
    "these physical conditions are actually so powerful that we could have set the value of @xmath81 to lie between the narrow range of @xmath184 and @xmath25 without carrying out much of the exercise done before . and",
    "the same conditions show that for @xmath185 , irrespective of the nature of the ambient medium , we would never have a solution which admits @xmath186 ( for instance @xmath187 discussed before ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the value of @xmath81 should lie within such a narrow range .",
    "the physical constraints also imply that the maximum value of the bulk lf of the shocked material in the fb is @xmath188 , and thus the reverse shock in a grb problem is bound to be non - relativsitic . from such considerations , we can approximately write    @xmath189    and @xmath190    now we can go back to the work of sari & piran ( 1995 ) to see if the condition for occurrence of an ultrarelativistic reverse shock is valid or not .",
    "they have considered a case with @xmath191 ( see eq .",
    "5 of sari & piran 1995 ) for which @xmath192 ( see our eq .",
    "but , if we use our eq.(16 ) , we immediately find that , for such a value of @xmath166 , we would have @xmath193 , which is unphysical in view of the constraint ( 25 ) . on the other hand , note that , eq .",
    "( 22 ) and ( 23 ) are consistent with such physical constraints .",
    "so , as long as we can assume that the radiative processes in both the forward - shocked fluid and the reverse - shocked fluid are sufficiently fast , we have @xmath194 .",
    "but since the reverse shock is actually , at best , mildly relativistic , particles are not expected to be accelerated to very high lorentz factors within the limited observed duration of grbs . and",
    "since for the radiative processes like synchrotron and inverse compton , the time scales are inversely proportional to the lf of the particles , there is a possibility that the reverse - shocked fluid might significantly stretch the expected theoretical grb time scales .",
    "how justified is this apprehension ?",
    "the strength of the signal appearing from the two regions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) should depend on the ratio of the power dissipated in the two regions . and",
    "the latter should depend on the ratio of the amount of work done by @xmath195 on the ambient medium ( 1 ) , and by @xmath196 on ( 4 ) . because the value of the fluid pressure is the same at @xmath195 and @xmath196 ( @xmath197 ) , the rate of compression or the rate of @xmath198 work done by the two shocks is @xmath199 .",
    "since this rate is lorentz invariant , and the expected value of @xmath200 , we find that the amount of available power that goes into the compression of the fb is negligible .",
    "accordingly , the rate of work done by the reverse - shock in any form , whether it is the heating of the fb , or producing enhanced magnetic field in it or producing low energy photons to facilitate inverse compton boosted gamma - ray production in the region ( 2 ) is actually negligible .",
    "thus we come to a very important conclusion that we can practically ignore the reverse shock in studying the gross time scale of grbs within the meszaros and rees framework ! this above understanding enables us to write    @xmath201    where @xmath202 .",
    "this value of @xmath203 is obviously one order higher than the usually quoted value of @xmath204 . by recalling the value of @xmath205 from eqn .",
    "( 21 ) , we can rewrite    @xmath206    for a given value of @xmath88 , the above derived value of @xmath203 is at least one order large than similar values used in the literature ( for instance see eqn . [ 5.2 ] of mochkovitch et al , 1995 )",
    "we have been able to remove a basic qualitative deficiency in the theoretical description of grbs in the meszaros and rees scenario , which has become the `` standard model '' for understanding the phenomenology of these events , i.e. , whether @xmath207 or @xmath208 .",
    "although , none of these expressions appeared to be quite correct our final result is obviously tilted in favour of the former relation which is , however , to be modified by a numerical factor @xmath209 .",
    "we have also emphasized an important aspect in this problem : the minimum value of the ratio of the lorentz invariant power liberated in the forward blast wave and the reverse shock goes as @xmath210 .",
    "this point should considerably simplify the evaluation of the emitted spectrum in the problem .",
    "although we have assumed a spherical fb , this discussion remains unchanged even for a case when the actual fb has a funnel type structure in the proper frame . to appreciate this subtle point ,",
    "consider the creation of jet type fbs following a ns - ns collision event ( rees & meszaros 1992 ) .",
    "suppose the @xmath211 fb is due to collisions of @xmath212 and @xmath213s emanating from the super hot and about - to - merge neutron stars .",
    "then , despite the asymmetry in the binary geometry , @xmath211 pairs would be produced over the full @xmath214 solid angle , though there would be excess production along the symmetry axis because of larger value of collision angle along the same .",
    "unless we are sure about the exact configuration of the neutrinosphere associated with each @xmath215 , or the configuration of the thick disk that may be formed as the result of merger , and also the temporal evolution of the whole pattern , it can only be a matter of conjecture as to how much excess production of pairs is achieved at a particular point with a given value of @xmath216 and @xmath34 .",
    "the canonical values of @xmath217 or @xmath218 is actually obtained by assuming a broad isotropic picture of the events , and one should actually consider the use of a fiducial value of @xmath4 _ per unit solid angle _ for dealing the anisotropic cases . in case there is some excess production in a certain direction , _ it does not mean that the pair flux produced in other directions somehow gets focussed in that direction _ to result in the same canonical value of @xmath4 assumed for the spherical @xmath141 case . and the basic reason that there might be a funnel type geometry of the fb is not the somewhat excess production of pair in a given direction .",
    "the basic reason , instead , is that the mass flux of the debris of ns - ns merger event is assumed to be appreciably less in those preferred directions yielding a value of @xmath219 .",
    "if the merger event spews off a baryonic mass @xmath220 , then even for an assumed ( spherical ) value of @xmath221 , in the isotropic case we would have @xmath222 , and there would be no grb ! it is primarily on this account that the assumption of relatively baryon free funnel along the symmetry axis gives rise to jet - like fbs .",
    "it only means that there are other jet - like fbs too but they have unacceptably low value of @xmath10 .",
    "thus , in our view , once we keep a canonical value of @xmath4 and tacitly assume an intrinsically spherical fb ( though having various values of @xmath10 in various directions ) , for a given observer , we must not additionally plug in the solid angle factor in associated quantities like @xmath12 or @xmath16 , as have been done by meszaros , rees and papathanassion ( 1994 ) . to further appreciate this point ,",
    "we can specifically consider two typical equations considered by them ( 2.4 and 2.16 )          where @xmath225 is the semi - angle of the funnel , @xmath226 is the total bolometric fluence of the burst occuring at a distance of @xmath227 .",
    "note that , although , both _ mathematically and physically @xmath228 should correspond to absence of any burst , the two foregoing equations would suggest @xmath229 , and @xmath230 for a non - existent burst !",
    "this happens because the value of @xmath4 was not scaled down in keeping with the value of @xmath34 in these equations virtually presuming that the canonical value for an isotropic fb energy somehow gets channelized along the narrow funnels_. therefore , we reinterpret our basic result that in case the fb is conical with a solid angle @xmath231 in its rest frame , then @xmath232 is to be replaced by @xmath233 to take care of the fractional energy channelization .",
    "it follows then that if we apply equations similar to ( 29 ) or ( 30 ) , we , eventually get back the original eq.(28 ) . in other words ,",
    "the basic temporal properties of the fb ( along a given direction ) should be more or less unaltered even for an anisotropic case as long as we are able to define @xmath234 in a meaningful way .",
    "it may be reminded here that although the generation of a relatively baryon free , high @xmath10 jet - like fb is required for understanding the grbs the understanding about their genesis is largely a matter of conjecture and is something like having `` an artist s conception '' .",
    "this is so in view of the ( i ) uncertainty about the physical mechanism triggering grbs , ( ii ) even for an assumed mechanism like a ns - ns merger , the merger geometry is unknown and evolving faster ( at the moment of maximum energy liberation ) on timescales shorter than the observed grb timescales , ( iii ) unknown effects like probable new general relativistic instabilities and the unknown nature and evolution of the coelesced object , ( iv ) the unknown extreme parameters like temperature , density and their profiles in the dynamic and unknown merger geometry like accretion disk , torus etc .",
    "( v ) the unknown microphysics at such extreme conditions like the equation of state and viscosity profiles of the dynamic merged object , and also the basic uncertainty about ( vi ) the relative importance of energy loss by gravitational radiation and neutrino emission .",
    "the actual burst duration , even when we consider the emission of _ hard x - rays and gamma rays only _ , can obviously be longer than what is suggested by eq .",
    "( 29 ) if the fb fails to radiate the available energy ( @xmath235 at @xmath13 ) .",
    "in fact , when the burst fails to be radiative at @xmath236 , there may be a weak and prolonged burst corresponding to a larger value of @xmath15 .",
    "also , if we redefine the burst duration as the one during which the fb radiates @xmath237 of its energy we would have a value of @xmath16 larger by a factor of few ( @xmath238 ) .",
    "we remind the reader again that this whole discussion explored the question of duration of the grb in the idealistic meszaros & rees framework which assumes that even in a sparse ism ( @xmath169 ) , the hydrodynamic limit is achieved at any radius . since the leading protons of the fb interact with the sparse ism extremely weakly because the bacground ism magnetic field is very weak , and we are not aware of any cooperative phenomemon by which these protons may collectively interact much more strongly by self generating strong magnetic fields on their way up , _ it is quite uncertain _ whether grbs can be triggered in ordinary sparse ism ( mitra 1996 ) .",
    "naturally , there may be no strong shock at all at @xmath173 unless grbs are hatched in special dense regions of ism although subsequently the blastwave may propagate in the ordinary ism and generate various low energy afterglow .",
    "the eventual mechanism of grbs could be considerably different than what our present understanding admits and then part of the present discussion may be invalidated .",
    "for instance all the existing hydrodynamical models assume that _ protons / ions accelerated in the shock can transfer their energy to the associated electrons sufficiently fast so that the radiative time scale of the shock is determined by the much shorter radiative time scale of the electrons_. this assumption _ need not be correct _ and though it was pointed out privately by the present author to several other authors working on this problem this aspect has been glossed over for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we will discuss in a seperate paper under what condition the hydrodynamical description may be valid even at small values of @xmath216 and how it may be possible to have a blast wave with a higher efficiency for gamma ray production ( mitra 1997 )",
    ".    it may be also possible that the fundamental mechamism for the grbs is not an one shot collision process ( involving compact objects ) but , on the other hand , a process whereby energy is released erratically and in a jerky manner in the form of an `` unsteady wind '' over a duration of tens of seconds or even longer .",
    "in such a case the basic grb duration will obviously be determined by the central source though afterglow time scales may be determined by hydrodynamic model discussed in this work .    finally , let us point out that one can also seperately define @xmath239 , @xmath240 , and @xmath241 in the context of the hydrodynamical model for the post grb phase of the event provided one has a model for generation of respective radiations .",
    "after the main grb phase , the value of @xmath24 would decrease rapidly and would approach unity , i.e , the blast wave will become newtonian like a snr . at each stage",
    "the afterglow will be characterized by a time scale @xmath242 with no simple and general relationship between @xmath243 and @xmath10 .",
    "such afterglow time scales can obviously be arbitrarily long and exceed even hundreds of years if the grb event occurs in the local group .",
    "thus , if we are fortuitous , we may be able to identify some of the presenly known snrs which have no signature of harbouring a compact object at their centers as gamma ray burst remnants ( grbr ) ."
