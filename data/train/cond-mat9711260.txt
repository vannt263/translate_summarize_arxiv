    "in semiclassical theory of coulomb blockade@xcite , electron tunneling is controlled by the charging energy which is determined by the junction capacitance .",
    "while the existence of this elementary charging effect is clearly seen in multijunction configurations@xcite , in a single junction , because of the stray capacitance , only partial blockade has been observed.@xcite the question is then , including the electromagnetic environment , what is the effective junction capacitance ?",
    "the work of devoret _",
    "et al_@xcite has shown that external electrical circuit has strong impact on the effect of coulomb blockade in a single junction , and under standard experimental condition where the external resistance is much smaller than the resistance quantum @xmath0=@xmath1 , the coulomb gap is totally smeared out at low voltages and at low temperature .",
    "a similar result was also obtained by girvin _",
    "et al_.@xcite in both works , as well as in most existing studies on charging ultrasmall tunnel junctions , the tunnel hamiltonian was treated perturbatively@xcite using the fermi golden rule .",
    "this lowest order perturbative approach is valid for weak tunneling strength .    with increasing tunneling strength",
    ", one must go beyond the fermi golden rule to include higher order tunneling processes .",
    "the conventional perturbative calculation is very tedious , and has been used to study the statistical properties of a single electron box ( seb).@xcite in a seb an island is formed between a tunnel junction and a gate capacitor .",
    "this is the simplest structure exhibiting the charging effect . even for such simplest system",
    ", it is very difficult to derive the partition function beyond the second order of the dimensionless tunnel conductance @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the tunnel resistance.@xcite therefore , an entirely different approach is required to investigate the physics associated to strong tunneling strength .",
    "the functional integral method has been used to study an open , undriven tunnel junction.@xcite as an extension of this work , the relevant properties of a seb have been investigated with the path integral representation of the partition function.@xcite it has been proved@xcite that a formal perturbation expansion of the partition function results in exactly the same form as that derived with the path integral method , provided that the channel number of the tunnel junction is very large , which is the case for metallic tunnel junctions .",
    "furthermore , based on the functional integral formulism , a monte - carlo simulation can be constructed for the entire regime from weak to strong tunneling strength .",
    "the monte - carlo simulation has been performed for the seb and a very smooth interpolation between the weak tunneling and the strong tunneling regime has been obtain.@xcite therefore , functional integral is a reliable powerful tool to study ultrasmall metallic tunnel junctions with arbitrary tunneling rate .",
    "since most experimental investigations on ultrasmall tunnel junctions measure the current response to applied voltage , a relevant theoretical study must take into account the influence of the electromagnetic environment .",

    "iv we restrict ourselves to the simple controllable electromagnetic environment which allows us to compare our theoretical results with the recent measurements.@xcite for this case we only need the dc conductance which is the zero frequency limit of the imaginary part of the quantum admittance .",

    "<S> we have investigated the quantum admittance of an ultrasmall tunnel junction with arbitrary tunneling strength under an electromagnetic environment . using the functional integral approach a close analytical expression of the quantum admittance </S>",
    "<S> is derived for a general electromagnetic environment . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider a specific controllable environment where a resistance is connected in series with the tunneling junction , for which we derived the dc quantum conductance from the zero frequency limit of the imaginary part of the quantum admittance . </S>",
    "<S> for such electromagnetic environment the dc conductance has been investigated in recent experiments , and our numerical results agree quantitatively very well with the measurements . </S>",
    "<S> our complete numerical results for the entire range of junction conductance and electromagnetic environmental conductance confirmed the few existing theoretical conclusions . </S>"
