    "observations of the galactic center  ( gc ) reveal a cluster of about 20 stars , mainly main - sequence b stars , that extends outward to about a tenth of a parsec from the central supermassive black hole  ( sbh ; * ? ? ?",

    "the existence of such young stars so close to the gc sbh  challenges our understanding of star formation since the strong tidal field of the sbh  should inhibit the collapse and fragmentation of molecular clouds  @xcite . for this reason",
    ", it is usually assumed that the s - stars formed elsewhere and migrated to their current locations . however , the migration mechanisms proposed in the literature result in orbital distributions that differ substantially from what is observed .",

    ", we apply recent insights about how relativity interacts with newtonian ( star - star ) perturbations near schwarzschild and kerr sbhs . using an approximate hamiltonian formulation that includes a post - newtonian description of the effects of relativity",
    ", we explore the evolution of the s - star orbits starting from initial conditions that correspond to the different formation models proposed in the literature .",
    "evolving the initial conditions for a time of the order the lifetime of the s - stars , and comparing with the observed distribution of orbital elements , allows us to place constraints on both the parameters of the nuclear cusp and the s - star origin models .",
    "timescales of interest are of order 100 myr , the main - sequence lifetime of a b star , or less .",
    "such times are short compared with two - body ( non - resonant , nr ) relaxation times near the center of the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hence we ignore nr relaxation in what follows and assume that orbital energies , i.e. semi - major axes @xmath7 , are unchanged once a star has been deposited near sgr a@xmath8 .",
    "resonant relaxation ( rr ) @xcite acts to change orbital eccentricities in a time @xmath9 the `` incoherent rr time , '' where @xmath10 is the angular momentum of a circular orbit having the same semi - major axis as the test star and @xmath11 is the `` coherence time , '' defined as the time for a typical field - star to change its orbital orientation ; the latter is the shortest of the mass precession time ( due to the distributed mass ) , the relativistic precession time ( due to the 1pn corrections to the newtonian equations of motion ) , and the time for rr itself to reorient orbital planes . for instance , in the case that field - star precession is dominated by relativity , @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the orbital period of the test star , @xmath15 is the number of field - stars with semi - major axes less than @xmath7 , @xmath16 is the mass of the field stars , and mpc is milliparsecs ; @xmath17 has been assumed .",
    "rr ceases to be effective at changing the eccentricities of stars whose orbits lie below ( at higher eccentricities than ) the `` schwarzschild barrier '' ( sb ) , the locus in the ( @xmath18 ) plane where relativistic precession of the test star acts in a time shorter than the time for the field - star torques to change @xmath19 .",
    "the sb is defined approximately by @xcite @xmath20 orbits above ( at lower @xmath21 than ) the sb evolve in response to rr by undergoing a random walk in @xmath21 .",
    "if such an orbit `` strikes '' the sb , it is `` reflected '' in a time of order the coherence time and random - walks again to lower @xmath21 , in a time @xmath22 , before eventually striking the sb again etc . penetration of the sb from above can occur but only on a timescale that is longer than both the rr and nrr timescales @xcite .    if a star should find itself _ below _ the sb , torques from the field stars are still able to change the orientation of its orbital plane ( `` 2d rr '' ) even though changes in eccentricity are suppressed .",
    "the timescale for changes in orientation is @xmath23 where again @xmath17 has been assumed .",
    "however , 2drr itself ceases to be effective for orbits that come sufficiently close to the sbh , where dragging of inertial frames by a spinning sbh induces lense - thirring precession with a period that is shorter than the time for 2drr to randomize orbital planes .",

    "the latter stars are subject to rr after crossing the barrier and end up with a nearly thermal eccentricity distribution .",
    "a clear `` gap '' between the two populations is evident in several of the frames of figure  [ fig2 ] ; the gap extends from the sb on the right , to a somewhat higher eccentricity on the left .",

    "* ) ; this mechanism is qualitatively similar to resonant relaxation but obeys a different set of relations @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "when eccentricities are initially low , as in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig2 ] , they tend to remain low , i.e. , above the sb .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the permeability of the sb tends to increase near @xmath110 and this can be seen in figure  [ fig2 ] as well .",

    "eccentricity distributions were found to approach a nearly  thermal \" form in a time of order @xmath125 . based on figure  [ fig3 ] , we see that the lifetime of the s - stars may , or may not , be long enough for this to happen , depending on the nuclear model .",
    "we compared the results of the monte - carlo integrations with s - star data by performing 2-sample kolmogorov - simornov  ( k - s ) tests on the @xmath21 distributions  ( table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "the best match to observations is attained after @xmath126myr of evolution in _ stellar _ cusp models in the continuous scenario with @xmath103 and starting from initially high eccentricities  ( k - s test @xmath127-values of @xmath128 ) .",
    "integrations that include stellar bhs also generate orbital distributions which are in agreement with observations after approximately @xmath129 and @xmath126myr of evolution for initially high and low eccentricity distributions respectively .",
    "we tested the degree of randomness of the orbital planes using the rayleigh statistic  @xmath130 @xcite , defined as the resultant of the unit vectors @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is perpendicular to the orbital plane of the @xmath133 star and @xmath134 is the total number of monte - carlo data points  ( i.e. ,  @xmath135 ) .",

    "the fraction of stars that would have been tidally disrupted after @xmath115myr of evolution was never larger than @xmath142  ( table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "as a comparison , in purely newtonian integrations , @xcite found that up to @xmath143% of stars were disrupted after @xmath126myr of evolution .",
    "in this paper we studied the combined effects of newtonian and relativistic perturbations on the angular momentum evolution of the galactic center  ( gc ) s - stars . for the first time we have shown that the @xmath124 distribution of the s - stars predicted by the binary disruption model , in which the stars are delivered to the gc on high - eccentricity orbits , is consistent with the observed orbits even when",
    "relativistic effects are considered . in these formation models ,",
    "most of the orbits lie initially below the schwarzschild barrier , the locus in the ( a , e ) plane where resonant relaxation is ineffective at changing eccentricities .",
    "contrary to this basic prediction , we found that orbits starting sufficiently close to the barrier are sometimes able to penetrate it , diffusing above and reaching a nearly thermal e - distribution ; a small fraction of stars remain confined below the barrier at low angular momenta  ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "a good match to observations is achieved after @xmath145myr of evolution if the distribution of field stars at the gc follows a nearly dynamically relaxed form .",
