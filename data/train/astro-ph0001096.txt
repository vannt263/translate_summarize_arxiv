    "recent detections of distant dusty galaxies with the scuba camera ( the submillimeter common user bolometer array ; holland et al .",
    "1999 ) on the 15  m james clerk maxwell telescope constitute a substantial fraction of the cosmic fir background detected by the _ firas _ and _ dirbe _ experiments on the _ cobe _ satellite ( puget et al .  1996 ; guiderdoni et al .",
    "1997 ; schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis  1998 ; fixsen et al .",
    "1998 ; hauser et al .  1998 ; lagache et al .  1999 ) .",
    "since the observed fir background is comparable to the total unobscured emission at ultraviolet / optical wavelengths , a full determination of the global star formation history of the universe requires a comprehensive understanding of this dust - enshrouded galaxy population .",
    "the 850  @xmath0 m scuba surveys to date have reported galaxy number counts that are in general agreement ( smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; barger et al .",
    "1998 ; hughes et al .  1998 ; blain et al .  1999a ; eales et al .  1999 ; barger , cowie , & sanders 1999 ) ; the cumulative surface density above 2  mjy is about @xmath9 .",
    "the discrete sources have bolometric luminosities that are characteristically @xmath10 if they lie at @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , the sources for which measurements exist at multiple wavelengths ( e.g.  ivison et al .",
    "1998 ) show thermal spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "thus , the scuba sources are inferred to be the distant analogs of the local ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulig ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) population .",
    "an essential observational goal is to determine the redshift distribution of the submillimeter population in order to trace the extent and evolution of obscured emission in the distant universe .",
    "however , identifying the optical / nir counterparts to the submillimeter sources is difficult due to the uncertainty in the scuba positions .",
    "barger et al .  ( 1999b ) presented a spectroscopic survey of possible optical counterparts to a flux - limited sample of galaxies selected from the 850  @xmath0 m survey of massive lensing clusters by smail et al .",
    "candidate optical counterparts in the scuba error - boxes were identified using moderately deep ground - based and _ hst _ exposures ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively ) .",
    "one - quarter of the sources could be reliably identified , and those had redshifts in the range @xmath8 . a lower limit of 20  per cent of the full sample showed signs of agn activity . however , for the majority of the submillimeter sources there were either no optical counterparts or the optical associations were not secure .",
    "such sources could either be at very high redshift or be so highly obscured that they emit their energy almost entirely in the submillimeter .",
    "high resolution radio continuum maps with subarcsecond positional accuracy and resolution offer new opportunities for locating submillimeter sources and determining their physical properties .",
    "the unique advantage of centimeter and fir observations is that galaxies and the intergalactic medium are transparent at these wavelengths , so observed flux densities are proportional to intrinsic luminosities . in galaxies without a powerful agn , the radio luminosity is dominated by diffuse synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons accelerated in supernovae remnants from stars more massive than @xmath14 .",
    "these massive stars live @xmath15  yr ; the relativistic electrons probably live @xmath16  yr ( condon 1992 ) . thus , radio observations probe very recent star formation .",
    "fir observations of starburst galaxies are also a direct measure of massive star formation . as summarized by condon ( 1992 ) , radio continuum emission and thermal dust emission",
    "are empirically observed to be tightly correlated due to both being linearly related to the massive star formation rate . if the fir - radio correlation applies to high redshift , as is plausibly the case ( though at the very highest redshifts compton cooling of the relativistic electrons by the microwave background may suppress the radio emission ) , then very sensitive radio observations can be used to pinpoint distant submillimeter sources .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the feasibility of using radio data to identify and characterize the bright submillimeter source population .",
    "richards ( 1999b ) recently obtained an extremely deep very large array ( vla ) 1.4  ghz image centered on the hubble deep field ( hdf ) .",
    "richards et al .",
    "( 1999 ) matched ground - based optical data from barger et al .",
    "( 1999a ) to the radio image and found that @xmath17 per cent of the galaxies in the sample could not be identified to optical magnitude limits of @xmath18 .",
    "in other respects , such as radio size and spectral index , the optically - faint objects were not any different from the remaining population .",
    "richards et al .",
    "( 1999 ) proposed four possible scenarios to explain this population , including @xmath19 obscured starbursts ( beyond @xmath20 the sensitivity to star forming galaxies cuts off due to the flux density limits of the radio data ) , extreme redshift ( @xmath21 ) agn , @xmath22 obscured agn , or one - sided radio jets .",
    "in the first phase of our program we observed with lris on the keck  ii 10  m telescope a complete subsample of the radio sources . our primary objective was to determine the redshifts of the optical / nir - faint ( @xmath23 ) radio sources .",
    "although we were able to spectroscopically identify nearly all the objects in our subsample to @xmath24 ( all had @xmath25 ) , we were unable to obtain redshifts for the fainter objects .",
    "either these sources are distant ( @xmath26 ) with spectral features lying outside the optical wavelength range , or the visibility of remarkable features is strongly affected by dust in the galaxies .",
    "if the optical / nir - faint radio sources are highly dust obscured systems , then it is possible that they will be detectable in the submillimeter . in the second phase of our program we observed with scuba 15 of the 22 optical / nir - faint radio sources in the central @xmath27  square arcminute region of the radio map ;",
    "another 4 were observed by hughes et al .",
    "( 1998 ; hereafter h98 ) in the hdf - proper .",
    "the jiggle map mode enabled simultaneous observations of a large fraction ( 31/48 ) of the optical / nir - bright radio sources .",
    "even with relatively shallow scuba observations ( a @xmath2 detection limit of 6  mjy at 850  @xmath0 m ) , we detected 5 of the optical / nir - faint radio sources ; a sixth with submillimeter flux @xmath28  mjy was detected in the deep hdf - proper submillimeter map of h98 .",
    "in contrast , none of the optical / nir - bright radio sources were detected .",
    "we additionally detected two @xmath5  mjy sources that did not have radio counterparts .",
    "thus , our targeted scuba survey of optical / nir - faint radio sources turned up @xmath29 per cent of the bright submillimeter sources in our surveyed areas .    in the final phase of our program",
    ", we explored the feasibility of obtaining redshift estimates from the submillimeter - to - radio flux ratios , as recently suggested by carilli & yun ( 1999 ) .",
    "we find that the redshifted arp  220 sed reasonably describes both redshifted local ulig data and known high redshift submillimeter sources and hence can be used as a rough redshift estimator .",
    "we estimate that all of our bright submillimeter sources fall in the redshift range @xmath6 , consistent with the redshifts for the lensed submillimeter sources of barger et al .",
    "( 1999b ) .",
    "once we have redshifts for the distant submillimeter source population , we can determine the global evolution of star formation in dust - obscured galaxies .",
    "previous studies of the star formation rate density ( sfrd ) have primarily used rest - frame ultraviolet data ( e.g.  madau et al .",
    "however , the ultraviolet emission from a galaxy is heavily affected by the presence of even small amounts of dust , and the extinction corrections are highly uncertain ; for example , corrections for dust obscuration at @xmath30 range from factors of @xmath31 ( pettini et al .  1997 ) to factors of @xmath32 ( meurer et al .",
    "1997 ) , though the more recent estimate of meurer , heckman , & calzetti ( 1999 ) lowers the latter to a factor of @xmath33",
    ". only direct measurements of the reradiated light at submillimeter wavelengths can securely address the sfrd at high redshifts .",
    "the true sfrd will receive contributions from both the ultraviolet / optical and the submillimeter .",
    "we find that the submillimeter contribution to the sfrd in the @xmath6 range from our @xmath5  mjy sources is comparable to the observed ultraviolet / optical sfrd contribution .",
    "the ultraviolet lyman - break galaxies are on the average undetected in the submillimeter at a @xmath34 level of @xmath35  mjy , and thus the lyman - break galaxy population is largely distinct from the bright submillimeter population ( chapman et al .  1999 ) .",
    "if we assume that fainter submillimeter sources have the same redshift distribution and properties as the @xmath5  mjy sample , then the sfrd of the entire population contributing to the submillimeter background is about an order of magnitude higher than the observed ultraviolet / optical sfrd . the contribution from uligs to the sfrd increases by more than two orders of magnitude from @xmath7 to @xmath6 , which supports a scenario in which the distant submillimeter sources are the progenitors of massive spheroidal systems .",
    "this rapid evolution in the ulig population sampled by scuba can be reproduced in models ( e.g. , blain et al .  1999b , c ) .",
    "2 we present our radio sample and optical / nir imaging , along with our new scuba and lris observations . in ",
    "3 we determine our radio - selected submillimeter source counts . in ",
    "4 we introduce the predicted high redshift submillimeter - radio flux correlation and obtain millimetric redshift estimates for our sources . in ",
    "5 we use the complementary information from radio and submillimeter fluxes to gain insights into the characteristics of our radio - selected submillimeter source population . in ",
    "6 we compare the rest - frame colors of the radio sources that have spectroscopic redshifts with the rest - frame colors of our submillimeter sources and find that the latter are likely to fall in the extremely red object category . in   7 we calculate the luminosities , number densities , and sfrds of our submillimeter sources .",
    "we compare the submillimeter contribution to the sfrd with contributions from radio and ultraviolet / optical wavebands over a range of redshifts . in   8 we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "we take @xmath36  km  s@xmath37  mpc@xmath37 and consider both @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , which should cover the full range of possible cosmologies .",
    "the present study is based on deep radio maps centered on the hdf that were observed with the vla at 1.4  ghz ( richards 1999b ) and 8.5  ghz ( richards et al .",
    "the primary 1.4  ghz image covers a @xmath42 diameter region with an effective resolution of @xmath43 and a @xmath44 completeness limit of 40  @xmath0jy .",
    "the 8.5  ghz images have an effective resolution of @xmath45 and a @xmath44 completeness limit of 8  @xmath0jy over a radius of @xmath46 from the hdf center , rising to 40  @xmath0jy at @xmath47 .",
    "the 1.4  ghz hdf map was trimmed to match the 79.4  arcmin@xmath48 nir and optical imaging of the field obtained by barger et al .",
    "( 1999a ) .",
