    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are among the most luminous explosive events known , and are observable from halfway across the universe ( e.g. , rodney et al .",
    "the peak luminosities of sne ia are well correlated with the decline rate of their light curves , thereby permitting their use as standardizable candles @xcite .",
    "the combination of these two properties has made sne ia very useful for measuring cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "as surveys have grown in scope , systematic errors are becoming the dominant source of uncertainty in type ia sne - based cosmological constraints @xcite .",
    "even as sne ia have been crucial in shaping our understanding of the universe , the nature of their progenitor systems remains theoretically ambiguous and observationally elusive ( for a review see @xcite ) . while it is commonly accepted that sne ia result from the thermonuclear explosion of a carbon - oxygen white dwarf ( wd ) in a close binary system , the nature of the binary companion and the chain(s ) of events leading up to the sn explosion are still uncertain .",
    "broadly speaking , there are two dominant progenitor models .",
    "the first is the double degenerate ( dd ) scenario where the companion is also a wd @xcite .",
    "the second is the single degenerate ( sd ) scenario where the companion is a non - degenerate object : a main sequence ( ms ) star , a red giant ( rg ) , a sub - giant , or a he star @xcite .",
    "while the sd scenario is widely considered to be the more plausible channel for sne ia , there is mounting evidence suggesting that this view is incorrect .",
    "first , sne ia progenitor models predict outflows during the presupernova evolution creating windblown cavities , however , @xcite find that the x - ray observations of 7 young sn ia remnants are inconsistent with this picture .",
    "second , it has recently been shown that rate of wd mergers in the galactic disk is comparable to that of the sne ia rate in milky way like galaxies , seemingly in support of the dd scenario @xcite .",
    "additionally , giant donors seem to be ruled out observationally as the dominant channel ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and in this study we do not consider them as possible progenitor systems . an he star donor was recently ruled out for the nearby type ia sn  2011fe @xcite , while main sequence and sub - giant companions have mounting evidence against them ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but might still remain a significant channel for the production of sne ia .    one approach to constraining",
    "the sd channel is to examine the effects of the explosion on the donor star @xcite .",
    "while many aspects of the interaction of a type ia explosion with the donor star , such as its kick velocity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , early - time shock emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the statistical properties of the surviving companion population @xcite , and the amount of material removed by the explosion @xcite , have received close attention , little has been made of the dramatic changes in the properties of the donor following the explosion .",
    "@xcite recently emphasized that fully @xmath8 of the mass removed from the companion is due to ablation ( shock - mediated heat transfer ) , not stripping ( momentum transfer ) , so mass can not be removed without heating the star because ablation and heating are not independent variables .",
    "thus , as mass is ablated from the companion , the entire stellar interior is also shock heated and the remaining envelope is significantly puffed up @xcite .",
    "@xcite modeled the future evolution of sn ia companions by considering a constant amount of mass stripped from the donor star while treating the energy injected into the envelope of the companion as a free parameter , and varied it almost by an order of magnitude . while not favored by @xcite , models with small amounts of energy injected into the remaining star compared to the binding energy of the stripped material could actually become less luminous than the star s luminosity prior to the explosion .",
    "these low luminosity models are not , however , consistent with the simulations .",
    "in this paper we focus on the post - explosion state of the sd donor star .",
    "they are required to be more luminous than before the explosion by the physics observed in simulations of shock interactions .",
    "as a result , the recent observations of nearby sn remnants ( snrs ) to detect or constrain the surviving star are far more stringent than generally assumed . in section [ sec :",
    "postprop ] , we model the evolution of the donor star following the interaction with the sn ejecta and compare our results to previous discussions . in section",
    "[ sec : individual ] , we investigate nearby systems individually , first looking at snrs in the galaxy and the lmc and then discussing nearby extragalactic sne ia . section [ sec : core ] briefly discusses the effect of shock interactions on the binary companions of core - collapse sne . in section [ sec : conclusion ] we review our conclusions .",
    "there have been several numerical studies of the impact of the sn ejecta on a companion star of a sn ia .",
    "@xcite performed two - dimensional simulations of the impact of the sn ejecta on ms stars , sub - giants , and rgs using an eulerian hydrodynamics code and found that ms and sub - giant donors lost @xmath9 of their mass as a result of the impact .",
    "@xcite then pointed out that the pre - supernova mass transfer required by the sd model would change the stellar structure of the companion , causing it to become more compact than an isolated ms star . from this",
    "they concluded that less mass should be removed from the donor envelope than predicted by the models of @xcite .",
    "@xcite confirmed this using a three - dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code to model the impact of sn ejecta on a companion whose structure was specified by the binary evolution study of @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite performed the most detailed study to date , with the inclusion of symmetry - breaking effects ( i.e. orbital motion , rotation of the companion , and roche - lobe overflow ) in a simulation using the multi - dimensional adaptive mesh refinement code flash .",
    "they found that these effects again raise the mass unbound from the secondary to @xmath10 for a ms donor .",
    "these studies show that there is a generic sequence of events during the impact of the sn ejecta on the companion .",
    "the initial impact sends a shock into the donor s stellar envelope which also sends a reverse shock back into the sn shell and creates a contact discontinuity between the two .",
    "the reverse shock develops into a bow shock around the companion which deflects much of the sn ejecta around the donor .",
    "meanwhile , the forward shock penetrates the companion and the center of the shock slows as it encounters the steep density gradient of the stellar interior , accelerating once more after passing through the core .",
    "the wings of the shock , which propagate through the outer envelope , move faster than they do through the center because they are propagating through regions of lower density , causing the shock to become highly curved .",
    "the curved shock meets itself at the backside of the companion , depositing much of its energy in the donor s envelope and ablating significant amounts of mass from the surface .",
    "this creates a back pressure on the rest of the companion , decreasing the kick imparted by the sn blast wave .",
    "after most of the sn ejecta has passed the donor , the shock - heated outer envelope of the companion begins to expand and some of it becomes unbound .",
    "the majority of the unbound material is at low velocities and is mixed with the inner iron - group layers of the sn ejecta .",
    "even though some material is unbound from the companion , the majority of its mass remains bound to the star .",
    "the net heating of the star is not reported , but in the standard @xmath1 @xmath2 ms model of @xcite the star is left with a hot , extended , asymmetric envelope containing @xmath11 of the mass , while the central pressure is halved .",
    "there is almost no discussion of the subsequent appearance of the stars other than in @xcite .",
    "they note that its core nuclear reaction rates will be diminished for a time - scale of @xmath12 years but that the luminosity will be driven by the kelvin - helmholtz collapse of the extended envelope .",
    "their expectation was for the star to become significantly more luminous ( @xmath13 for a ms 1 @xmath2 star ) .",
    "ideally , to study the long - term evolution of the impacted companion , one would want to model the three - dimensional interaction of the sn ejecta with a suite of possible donor stars until the companion is relaxed and roughly spherical",
    ". then one would use the mean density , temperature , and composition profiles as the initial conditions for a one - dimensional stellar evolution code and follow the companion until it settles back on the ms at the location of its current mass .",
    "@xcite show that the mass of the donor star can range from @xmath14 .",
    "we only explore the 1 @xmath2 ms model of @xcite because that paper contains the information needed to calibrate our model .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations to calibrate our simple models at other masses or evolutionary states are not available , but the results presented in this paper should generally hold .",
    "we study this problem using the approach of @xcite , who followed the evolution of a star which loses mass and is heated over a short period of time in order to mimic the effects of the explosion .",
    "we used the stellar evolution code mesa ( @xcite ) , allowing for fluid velocities .",
    "we added a module to first have a rapid phase of mass loss followed by a rapid phase of extra heating . in the the heating phase we also included an outer boundary @xmath15 , adjusting the mass loss rate so that any material at @xmath16 is lost in a wind on the escape time scale from that radius .",
    "this allowed us to treat mass loss as in @xcite or to allow the heating phase to be responsible for some or all of the mass loss when the amount of energy added becomes large .",
    "thus , the models had 4 parameters : the amount of mass lost in the first phase ( @xmath17 ) , the amount of energy added in the second phase ( @xmath18 ) , the truncation radius ( @xmath15 ) , and the time scale used for both the mass loss and heating phases ( @xmath19 ) . in each interval ,",
    "the mass loss and heating rates were linearly increased and then symmetrically decreased .",
    "the internal energy added per unit mass was distributed as the ratio of the enclosed mass at any radius to the total mass .",
    "thus more energy is deposited at the edge of the star than near the center .",
    "this leads to results more consistent with the @xcite simulations than , for example , making the energy added per unit mass independent of radius .",
    "it also makes sense physically , as the shock will deposit more energy per unit mass in the lower density regions of the star .",
    "we first considered models where @xmath20 to match the @xcite hydrogen cataclysmic variable ( hcv ) model @xmath21 , the secondary was represented by a @xmath1 @xmath2 main sequence model , and the sn was represented by the w7 ejecta profile @xcite . ] and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath1 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 or @xmath28  ergs .",
    "we used time scales of @xmath29 , @xmath25 and @xmath30 years , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath34 and @xmath35  ergs models did not converge for @xmath29  year and @xmath36 due to the development of an oscillation as the transient ends and the outer envelope collapses .",
    "figure [ fig : lr ] shows the evolution of the companion in luminosity and radius as a function of @xmath18 and the duration @xmath19 assuming @xmath36 after the transient phase ended .",
    "the expected luminosity and radius evolution depends little on @xmath19 once a time period @xmath19 has elapsed after the transient phase .",
    "the main effect appears to be an underestimate of the luminosity in that period , presumably because of the additional energy radiated during the transient phase . starting with the @xmath37  erg model",
    ", the star expands to @xmath36 , leading to a small amount of additional mass loss .",
    "the inclusion of the outer boundary appears to drive the high @xmath18 models to a similar final structure so that there is little difference in their subsequent evolution .",
    "the luminosity of the higher @xmath18 models can be restricted by reducing @xmath15 because it is the rapid collapse of a greatly over - expanded envelope that produces the highest luminosities .",
    "for example , using @xmath38 caps the luminosity of the high @xmath18 models at roughly @xmath39 , but they sustain that luminosity for a long time and then roughly merge onto the evolution of the models with @xmath40 .",

    "in general , we find that if @xmath18 is large enough to initiate mass loss ( the fiducial and higher @xmath18 models ) then the temperature decreases , and models with insufficient heating to initiate mass loss ( the lower @xmath18 models ) become hotter .",
    "since the ultimate mechanism of the mass loss is ablation due to heating , only the models with enough energy input to initiate mass loss are realistic . the total energy in sne ia ejecta is @xmath48  ergs , of which @xmath49  ergs is incident on the star since , assuming the companion must overflow its roche - lobe , @xmath50 .",
    "the binding energy of the @xmath51 @xmath2 of stripped material is @xmath52  ergs , so the total energy transfered to the star is approximately @xmath53  ergs and @xmath54 of that energy is used to strip material from the surface , and @xmath55 heats the remaining star . only a small fraction ( @xmath56 ) of the incident shock energy",
    "is transferred to the star . simply assuming that @xmath57 of the shock energy is transfered to the star with @xmath58 of that energy going into stripping mass does not perfectly reproduce the scaling of mass loss with @xmath59 in @xcite , but it comes considerably closer to doing so than the analytic estimates of @xcite .",
    "more generally , the transfer of energy into heating the surviving star is a crucial parameter that needs to be reported for any future simulations .    in the final analysis",
    ", the basic physics is relatively easy to understand .",
    "the shocks heat the star , depositing more energy per unit mass near the surface than near the center .",
    "however , the shocks have no physical knowledge of which material will eventually escape and the star has no sharp density jumps to create any features in the energy deposition .",
    "the heated material then expands , but with a continuous density distribution between material which ultimately escapes and material which remains bound . as a result , the energy deposited in material which eventually escapes can not be significantly larger than the energy deposited in the material which does not escape .",
    "mass is stripped beyond some effective radius @xmath15 , leaving a puffed - up envelope that then begins to cool and collapse .",
    "the more extended this envelope , the higher the peak luminosity since a lower density envelope has a shorter thermal time scale .",
    "ultimately , however , for the same envelope extent the star produces similar luminosities . because there are no means in this process of distinguishing between escaping and bound material until the escaping material is stripped , the low @xmath18 models following @xcite are unphysical because they effectively make the heating of the unbound material independent of the heating of the bound material .",
    "when the mass loss is driven by ablation , the energy used to strip mass must be tightly correlated with the energy used to heat the surviving star and is not an independent variable .    in this sense , alternate models where we drive the mass loss with only heating are far more physical . for small values of @xmath18",
    "the star expands but does not reach @xmath15 and has no mass loss .",
    "larger values of @xmath18 ( @xmath60 ergs ) expand the star to @xmath15 , and the stars begin to lose mass .",
    "the post - transient evolution of _ all _ stars that have had mass loss is very similar because the primary driver of their luminosity is the collapse of the envelope from @xmath15 to its eventual equilibrium radius .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : rout ] , which shows the evolution as a function of @xmath18 labeled by whether or not the stars lost any mass assuming @xmath36 . ignoring the luminosity during the transient , much of which is radiating energy injected into the expanding envelope , the subsequent evolution of the mass losing transients is essentially independent of the deposited energy .",
    "the amount of mass lost rises steadily with @xmath18 , and for the maximum energy @xmath61  ergs , the mass loss is approximately the same as in the hcv model .",
    "the central pressure of this model is , however , too low , which means that we should concentrate more of the energy deposition towards the surface .     where the mass loss is drive only by the heating .",
    "the models shown by the solid lines have lost mass , while those shown by the dotted lines have not expanded enough to lose any mass .",
    "note how all models with mass loss show similar late time evolution .",
    "the values of @xmath18 are , from bottom to top , @xmath23 , and @xmath62  ergs , @xmath36 and @xmath29  year .",
    "the vertical line marks the end of the heating period .",
    "the rapid collapse of the envelope leads to some initial oscillations that do not seem to affect the general results.,height=604 ]",
    "although challenging , searching for the donor star after a sn ia explosion has significantly faded is a popular method for testing the sd model . this can be done either by examining sources near the center of historical snrs or by observing the sites of recent sne ia in external galaxies . what has not been clearly factored into these discussions",
    "is that the surviving star must be cooler and more luminous than it was before the explosion .",
    "this is an unavoidable consequence of mass loss by ablation . our fiducial model with @xmath44 ergs and @xmath63 , the best match to simulations ( shown in figures [ fig : lr ] and [ fig : t ] ) , indicates that initially after the sn the companion has @xmath64 and @xmath65 k , depending slightly on @xmath19 .",
    "then , after @xmath66 years , we find @xmath67 and @xmath68 k. after @xmath69 years , we see @xmath70 and @xmath71 k. finally , after @xmath72 years @xmath73 and @xmath74 k.      searching for surviving stars near the centers of snrs is a promising method to distinguish between progenitor models @xcite , particularly given the ability to determine the sn type using either x - ray spectra of the remnant @xcite or dust echo spectra of the actual event ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "given sn ia rates and snr lifetimes , there are several examples in both the galaxy and the magellanic clouds .",
    "the challenge is to precisely identify the expected location of the star .",
    "first , the companion will have a non - negligible proper motion , which can be in any direction outwards from the sn explosion site @xcite .",
    "second , while in general type ia snrs are strikingly spherical , they will be slightly asymmetric due to differing densities of the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) and/or bubbles or clumps of gas and dust in the surrounding environment , which will add uncertainty to the measurement of the geometric center of the snr .",
    "moreover , as time passes , the donor star fades as it returns to thermal equilibrium .",
    "sn 1572 , first seen on november 6th , 1572 , was well observed for two years ( e.g. , tycho brahe , see @xcite ) .",
    "both the light curve @xcite and the spectrum obtained from light echoes @xcite show sn 1572 to have been a normal sne ia . in the past decade",
    "there have been many attempts to identify a sd companion star to sn 1572 .",
    "@xcite performed the first search and found a promising candidate near the center of tycho s snr , tycho g , a sub - giant with spectral type g2 iv , which has @xmath75 k , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and surface gravity log(@xmath78/cm s@xmath79)@xmath80 .",
    "they found that it is at a distance of @xmath81 kpc , with a large radial velocity of @xmath82 km s@xmath83 , and a high derived proper motion of @xmath84 km s@xmath83 .",
    "however , there is significant controversy about the true nature of tycho g. @xcite proposes that tycho g might simply be a thick - disk star coincidentally passing in the vicinity of the snr . @xcite",
    "classify tycho g as a f8 v star and argue that it could not be the donor star of sn 1572 because it does not exhibit the blue - shifted fe i absorption lines expected for a star surrounded by the ejecta of a sn due to fe i in the ejecta . the lack of fe i absorption suggests that tycho g is a foreground star .",
    "@xcite measure a smaller radial velocity ( @xmath85 km s@xmath83 ) and detect no proper motion , which is in moderate disagreement with the @xcite , and suggests that tycho g is not associated with the sn event .",
    "@xcite used keck high - resolution optical spectra to improve the stellar parameters , finding @xmath86 k , log(@xmath78/cms@xmath79 ) @xmath87 dex , and @xmath88 km s@xmath83 .",
    "they also find that tycho g is overabundant in ni , suggesting that it was polluted by the sn event .",
    "the rotational velocity ( @xmath89 ) of a surviving donor star could also be an important diagnostic of sne ia progenitor systems in the sd model .",
    "@xcite predict that surviving companions should be rapidly rotating with @xmath90 km s@xmath83 because they are tidally locked at the time of the explosion .",
    "tycho g , however , rotates slowly with estimates of @xmath91 km s@xmath83 and @xmath92 km s@xmath83 by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "@xcite did not account for the interaction of the sn ejecta with the donor , and they suggest this might explain the difference . in their full simulation with rotation and orbital motion , @xcite found that the impact removes @xmath93 of the angular momentum from a ms companion but only @xmath94 of its mass .",
    "they estimate an equilibrium radius for the donor star after the sn of @xmath95 , which still implies a high rotational velocity of @xmath96 km s@xmath83 .",
    "they suggest that the donor will still be out of thermal equilibrium and thus have a larger radius . however , since the angular momentum scales with radius and rotational velocity as @xmath97 , the stellar radius must be @xmath98 to be consistent with the observed limits .",
    "this conservatively assumes solid body rotation and a self - similar radial distribution of mass in the donor .",
    "however , @xmath99 is completely ruled out by the observed luminosity and temperature , so there remains a large disagreement between the observed and expected @xmath89 of tycho g assuming it was the donor star in the sn 1572 progenitor system .",
    "to this list of problems we can now add that tycho g is too low luminosity and too high temperature to be the survivor of a ia explosion .",
    "for any of our models consistent with @xcite , the luminosity should be @xmath100 , rather then the estimated @xmath101 , and the temperature should be @xmath102 k , rather than the observed @xmath103 k. the only models which would agree with the observed values are essentially the `` no heat '' models that are grossly inconsistent with the initial conditions demanded by the simulations .",
    "based on its luminosity , temperature and rotation rate , we conclude that tycho g is not associated with sn 1572 and that sn 1572 was not a traditional sd sn .      in many ways ,",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , at a distance of @xmath105 kpc @xcite , is a better place to look for the companions to type ia snrs because the distances to the remnant and nearby stars are well - determined .",
    "moreover , it is still close enough that hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) or ground - based adaptive optics observations can search for lower mass main sequence stars without severe problems from crowding .",
    "the central region of the lmc snr @xmath104 , created by a 1991t - like sne ia explosion @xmath106 years ago @xcite , was recently studied by @xcite using archival @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and h@xmath110 _ hst _ images .",
    "they were able to constrain the search region to @xmath111 and found no ex - companion stars in the central region to a limiting visual magnitude of @xmath112 mag , which they claim rules out all published sd models . however , this limit does not to account for the line of sight extinction to the lmc ( @xmath113 mag ) , so the actual limit is @xmath114 mag @xcite",
    ". additionally , @xcite assumed that main sequence donor stars will be minimally affected by the explosion .",
    "as with sn 1572 , our fiducial models calibrated to agree with @xcite predict that the surviving star should be @xmath115 after @xmath116 years .",
    "crudely speaking , this means that a limit of @xmath117 mag now corresponds to a limit of @xmath118 on the unperturbed progenitor star , which would correspond to a @xmath119 dwarf @xcite .",
    "lower mass companions are both rare and will be more affected by shock heating , so our conclusions largely hold for their scenarios as well .",
    "the central region of the lmc snr @xmath120 was studied recently by @xcite using archival @xmath108 and h@xmath110 _ hst _ images .",
    "light echoes of snr @xmath120 show that the sn spectrum is that of a normal sne ia that exploded @xmath121 years ago @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , @xcite were only able to constrain the location of possible companions to within @xmath122 . in this region , @xcite found 27 ms stars brighter then @xmath123 mag .",
    "the brightest star , star 1 , with @xmath124 mag corresponds to @xmath125 , which would allow for a solar mass companion .",
    "however , adding the expectation that the luminosity must be roughly increased by a factor of 10 , this really corresponds to a limit on the progenitor of @xmath126 and a solar mass companion is only marginally allowed .",
    "the limits are much more stringent for the fainter stars in the error circle .",
    "additionally , with a @xmath127 color of @xmath128 , figure 2 of @xcite shows that this star is on or close to the main sequence .",
    "based on our fiducial model we would expect a ex - companion to be redward of the main sequence , suggesting that star 1 is not the associated with the snr . however , further studies of the possible companions with more _ hst _ observations at different wavelengths or spectra should be carried out .",
    "currently , the nature of the progenitor system of snr @xmath120 can be still be considered uncertain .      besides observing the explosion sites of historical snrs",
    ", one could also look at the location of more recent sne ia once the sn has faded .",
    "this method benefits both from having very accurate search positions and from the greater luminosity of the surviving stars at earlier times ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "the main problem is that these directly observed sn are far more distant , with the closest being at a distance of @xmath130 mpc .",
    "we briefly discuss four of the closest sne ia observed in the last century .",
    "three historic sne ia , sn 1937c , sn 1972e , and sn 1986 g , are particularly good candidates for a study of their post - explosion systems because they are nearby and were well observed .",

    "finally , the closest sn ia discovered in the digital imaging era , sn 1986 g , was discovered in ngc 5128 ( centaurus a ) at a distance of @xmath133 mpc @xcite . given the historical sn explosion images , it should be possible to centroid the sn explosion to a fraction of an arcsecond and with _ hst _ observations one could plausibly find or rule out a sd companion for these sne ia .",
    "the recent type ia sn 2011fe in m  101 is the nearest ia in the last 25 years . at a mere 6.4 mpc @xcite",
    ", this sn ia provides an exceptional opportunity to put the strongest constraints on the progenitor system of any sne ia .",
    "@xcite obtained 12 epochs of high resolution spectra of sn 2011fe , finding that it is only slightly reddened and lies in a `` clean '' environment .",
    "@xcite used upper limits from both radio and x - ray observations of sn 2011fe to rule out circumstellar material from a giant companion .",
    "@xcite then strengthened these radio constraints with evla observations , ruling out most popular sd progenitor models .",
    "the proximity and the low extinction of sn 2011fe allowed @xcite to place @xmath134 times stronger constraints on the visible light from the progenitor system than previous studies using deep archival pre - explosion _",
    "hst_/acs observations .",
    "these observations rule out luminous red giants ( @xmath135 ) and most helium stars as plausible donors .",
    "sn 2011fe was discovered very quickly by the palomar transient factory @xcite on august 24 , 2011 , less than one day after explosion , allowing multi - wavelength follow - up observations to be quickly carried out . with the early time uv , optical , and x - ray observations @xcite and @xcite concluded that the radius of the primary was smaller than @xmath136 and @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "@xcite then went onto show that their constraints leave compact objects as the only viable primary . @xcite and @xcite also used the very early - time uv and optical observations to constrain the shock heating which would occur as the sn ejecta collides with the companion .",
    "they rule out giants and main sequence secondaries more massive than the sun .",
    "these constraints seem to imply that the dd model is the only viable progenitor model .",
    "however , these studies both rely on the calculations of @xcite , which assumes a roche - lobe - overflowing secondary with a typical stellar structure .",
    "as previously discussed , @xcite argued that the secondary should be smaller and more compact than a typical main sequence star .",
    "such a smaller , more tightly bound companion would produce a weaker signal at even earlier times which could have been missed .",
    "additionally , slightly less massive companions can also be too small for the sn ejecta shock to have been observed .    ) .",
    "we note that a signature of the presence of a sd ms companion to a sne ia explosion would be a break in the very late - time light curve ( @xmath138 days ) as the shock - heated companion becomes more luminous than the rapidly fading sn ejecta . we have assumed a blackbody to convert the models from  [ sec : postprop ] into vega magnitudes .",
    ", height=604 ]    very late time observations of sn 2011fe would place further constraints on the progenitor system by detecting , or putting upper limits on , the existence of a shocked donor .",
    "the luminosity of the surviving donor star is expected to be @xmath139 , which corresponds to @xmath140 mag . in figure",
    "[ fig : snfe ] , we present the @xmath141 light light curves of sn 2011fe of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite along with a linear fit for the late - time decline as compared to the expected evolution of our fiducial model . if the current decline rate continues , the shocked companion should begin to dominate the sn light in the @xmath142 days after maximum light .",
    "at that point , _ hst _ observations monitoring the very late - time light curve of sn 2011fe should see it level off as most of the observed flux will then be coming from the shock heated companion and not the expanding , cooling shell of ejecta .    however , there are other effects which might also cause the late - time sn light curve to flatten .",
    "first , light echoes from the sn explosion off nearby dust can add additional late - time flux as was seen from sn 1987a @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the environment surround sn 2011fe shows no evidence for gas or dust @xcite .",
    "second , auger and internal conversion electrons emitted in the decay of @xmath143co are expected to become a significant source of heating @xmath144 days after the explosion and dominate the positron decay of @xmath145co after @xmath72 days @xcite .",
    "the late - time bolometric light curve is then expected to flatten ( figure 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "fortuitously , the evolution of a nearby companion will occur on time - scales much longer than the half - life of @xmath143co ( 271.79 days ) .",
    "thus , a single degenerate companion would still be observable at even later times .",
    "interestingly , a similar process may also be possible during stripped core - collapse supernova ( sn iib , ib and ic ) explosions .",
    "one of the theoretical models for producing stripped core - collapse supernovae progenitors is using binary mass transfer to remove the outer envelope of the primary ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a common envelope phase ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or both . in such scenarios ,",
    "the companion is again forced to lie relatively close to the primary , with similar issues about mass stripping and shock heating to the sd sne ia case .",
    "the maximum shock energy is essentially the same as for the ia case because it is determined by the geometry of roche - lobe overflow .",
    "this means that the effects on main sequence binary companions , are likely greatly reduced .",
    "first , the escape velocity of a higher mass star is somewhat larger , so less mass is stripped for a given amount of energy .",
    "second , the internal energy of the higher mass star is much larger , so the fractional change in the energy created by the shock is much smaller .",
    "third , the luminosity of the star is much larger , so any adjustment leading to a roughly constant source of additional luminosity is a much smaller fractional change in the luminosity . as a result , we would expect that the effects on an @xmath146 main sequence companion with the same shock energy and geometry will not very dramatic , and this is confirmed in our numerical experiments .",
    "additionally , the typical ccsn binary companion ( without mass transfer ) can be at much larger distances than in a sne ia , so the effects will likely be unobservable for ms companions .    however , if the companion has evolved into a giant star , the effects can be much greater due to the significantly reduced binding energy of the companion s envelope .",
    "it may even be possible , if the separation between the sn and a giant companion is small , for the sn ejecta to completely strip the envelope of the companion , leaving only the dense core , as seen in hydrodynamic simulations of sne ia explosions with a giant companion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the problem is that most of the time the companion star to a ccsn will still be on the main sequence ( see @xcite ) unless the binary members were nearly exact twins @xcite .",
    "main - sequence ( ms ) donor stars surviving the explosion of a sd sne ia must be strongly heated and puffed up in a manner tightly coupled to their mass loss . in stellar evolution models that roughly match the final state of a 1 @xmath2 star losing 0.15 @xmath2 in the hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite , the star must be heated by @xmath44  ergs , and it commences its post explosion evolution with the radius and luminosity dramatically increased and the effective temperature modestly decreased . when mass is lost by ablation , it is not physically possible to avoid these effects .",
    "this means that the `` leftover '' stars of tycho s sn and in the lmc supernova remnants snr @xmath5 and snr @xmath120 should still be @xmath147 times more luminous than before the explosion .",
    "this greatly strengthens the arguments of @xcite against a sd scenario for the lmc snr @xmath5 and essentially rules out tycho star g as the survivor of sn 1572 .",
    "finally , such luminous donors should be observable with _ hst _ within @xmath6mpc .",
    "we point out that there are a number of recent nearby type ia sne , including sn 1937c , sn 1972e , sn 1986 g , and sn 2011fe @xmath7 years after the explosion that should be studied in detail . for the latter",
    ", difference imaging between late time and pre - explosion _ hst _ images should be a particularly powerful probe .",
    "thus , the sd channel has been ruled out for at least two nearby sne ia far more strongly than assumed and can be easily tested for several more .",
    "recent works have suggested the `` spin - down model '' as a way to avoid the existing limits by using rotational support of the wd to delay the explosion long enough to render the companion far fainter than at the time of accretion @xcite .",
    "in addition to several problems of fine tuning , there are no known physical systems where accretion leads to rotational velocities sufficiently close to breakup for rotation to be of much relevance to the hydrostatic support of the system .",
    "the fastest spinning wd known ( rx j0648.04418 , @xmath148 s , @xcite ) is still spinning at less than half the rate ( @xmath149 s ) needed for rotation to be important @xcite .",
    "moreover , most of the scenarios considered by @xcite lead to lower mass companions which will be even more drastically affected by shock heating , so our conclusions largely hold for their scenarios as well .",
    "existing hydrodynamic simulations of the effects of explosions on sne ia companions have largely ignored the consequences of the explosions for the future evolution of the stars , although @xcite comment on the problem and provide enough information to calibrate our model . at a minimum , simulations should report the final outer radius of the bound material and the final energies of the companion star ( as compared to the initial energies ) .",
    "better still would be to report asymmetrically averaged density and energy profiles that could then be used as the basis for more self - consistent models of their subsequent evolution .",
