    "+ the light scalar mesons represent nowadays one of the hottest topics in hadronic physics . despite the growing consensus on the existence of a complete light scalar nonet , comprising the @xmath0(600 ) (",
    "alias @xmath1 ) , @xmath2(800 ) ( alias @xmath3 ) , @xmath4(980 ) and @xmath0(980 ) , which are now all included @xcite in the pdg tables , their interpretation and possible dynamical origin in the context of qcd - inspired methods and models remains controversial .",
    "moreover , their classification with respect to the intermediate scalars @xmath0(1370 ) , @xmath2(1430 ) , @xmath4(1450 ) and @xmath0(1500 ) @xcite is also subject to continued debate .",
    "thus , before presenting our actual model calculations , a brief historical discussion of the main theoretical and phenomenological approaches to the light scalars appears quite opportune , facing this audience that covers many different fields of expertise .",
    "of course , time and space limitations do not allow an exhaustive treatment here .",
    "what makes the light scalars so awkward for quark - model builders is not only their `` lightness '' , as their masses would rather be expected in the 1.31.5 gev region , for conventional @xmath5 @xmath6 states , but also the fact that the isoscalar @xmath1 meson is much lighter than the isovector @xmath4(980 ) . moreover",
    ", the obviously nonstrange quark content of the @xmath4(980 ) makes it very difficult to understand its approximate mass degeneracy with the @xmath0(980 ) , which is dominantly an @xmath7 state , as can be inferred e.g.from the non - observation @xcite of the decay @xmath8 , whereas the process @xmath9 _ is _ seen @xcite . _ _",
    "these three problems were seemingly solved simultaneously in jaffe s",
    "@xcite @xmath10 proposal for ground - state scalar mesons , more than 30 years ago .",
    "namely , a very strong and attractive colour - hyperfine interaction for the lowest scalar @xmath11 ( alias tetraquark ) states could explain their low masses , while the mass degeneracy of the @xmath4(980 ) and @xmath0(980 ) would follow naturally from both having an @xmath12 configuration , where @xmath13 stands for @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "also the fact that the @xmath1 is lighter than the @xmath4(980 ) could then be easily explained from the smaller hyperfine attraction in the @xmath4(980 ) , owing to the presence of the ( heavier ) strange quarks in the latter .",
    "however , notwithstanding the originality and elegance of jaffe s idea , a serious problem , which also plagues the many recent yet similar tetraquark models , is its disregard of unitarisation effects . in other words ,",
    "the coupling to physical decay channels , which e.g.  produce the huge widths of the @xmath1 and the @xmath3 , will almost inevitably give rise to real mass shifts of at least the same order , i.e. , of ( many ) hundreds of mevs .",
    "therefore , as long as tetraquarks are not unitarised  and we are not aware of _ any _ attempt to do so  such models can only be considered qualitative , at best . _ _",
    "a completely different description of the light scalars is due to scadron and delbourgo @xcite , based on dynamical chiral - symmetry breaking . in their bethe - salpeter approach , the very same mechanism that makes the pion massless in the chiral limit , while giving the light quarks their dynamical mass , straightforwardly leads to a @xmath1 mass @xmath16 in the same limit , just like in the nambu  jona - lasinio @xcite model .",
    "more recently , delbourgo and scadron @xcite formulated a similar picture in a non - perturbative and self - consistent field - theoretic way , via the quark - level linear @xmath1 model ( qll@xmath1 m ) , both for @xmath17 and for @xmath18 , thus predicting a complete light scalar nonet having masses compatible with present - day experiment .",
    "note that in this formalism at least some coupled - channel effects are already accounted for , through meson - loop contributions that recover tree - level results by construction , via a non - perturbative bootstrap @xcite .",
    "another totally alternative view is the generation of at least some of the light scalars as dynamical resonances of two pseudoscalar ( p ) mesons .",
    "in particular , the @xmath4(980 ) and @xmath0(980 ) are described as a kind of @xmath19 molecules , owing to @xmath20-@xmath21 potentials that are either effective or mainly based on @xmath22-channel vector - meson exchange . in the former approach , due to weinstein and isgur @xcite ,",
    "the meson - meson interactions were extracted from a @xmath11 system and couplings to @xmath6 scalar mesons . in the latter purely mesonic approach , due to janssen , pearce , holinde and speth @xcite ,",
    "even a kind of @xmath1 was found , though too light and a bit too broad , with a pole at @xmath23 mev .",
    "however , no @xmath3 pole was reported .",
    "a more empirical but also interesting approach is due to anisovich ( v.  v. ) , anisovich ( a.  v. ) , sarantsev and co - workers @xcite , who carried out @xmath20-matrix analyses of @xmath24-wave pp scattering data , thereby identifying the @xmath20-matrix poles with the bare scalar @xmath6 states that should follow from quark - antiquark ( or gluon - gluon ) interactions only .",
    "although the idea to try to extract information on `` quenched - qcd '' spectra from scattering data is very appealing , and goes way beyond the traditional , naive approach to meson spectroscopy , the identification of @xmath20-matrix poles with bare states puzzles us .",
    "namely , @xmath20-matrix poles correspond to the real energies at which the meson - meson phase shift passes through @xmath25 , but bare states do not couple at all to the continuum and so for these there simply is no phase shift .",
    "we rather believe the bare states are at the real energies where ( some ) @xmath24-matrix poles end up if one manages to continuously turn off the coupling to the continuum .",
    "we shall come back to this point below .",
    "anyhow , the distorted scalar nonets inferred from the analyses in ref .",
    "@xcite , missing the @xmath1 and the @xmath3 , already hint at problems with the @xmath20-matrix identification .",
    "a phenomenological chiral model has been developed by schechter and collaborators @xcite , in which a crossing - symmetric amplitude is constructed by summing a current - algebra contact term and leading resonance pole exchanges .",
    "inclusion of `` putative '' light scalar mesons then satisfies unitarity bounds to well above 1 gev , and allows good fits to the data .",
    "another formalism based on effective chiral lagrangians is the work by oller , oset and pelez @xcite , which is often called unitarised chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "amplitudes from leading - order or next - to - leading - order chpt are unitarised via multichannel lippmann - schwinger equations or other coupled - channel methods .",
    "after fitting the parameters to the available data , a nonet of light scalar mesons shows up as dynamical resonance poles , though the @xmath0(980 ) needs a preexisting bare state in one of the formulations ( @xmath26 method ) .",
    "recently , a prediction for the @xmath1 pole was obtained by caprini , colangelo and leutwyler ( ccl ) @xcite , via roy equations applied to the @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xmath29 scattering amplitudes . the roy equations amount to a twice - subtracted dispersion relation , so that some input from theory or experiment is needed to fix the subtraction constants , for which ccl took predictions from chpt .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 pole position of @xmath30 mev is somewhat on the low @xcite side as for its real part .",
    "moreover , the claimed small errors seem too optimistic , mainly because of the incomplete treatment of the @xmath19 channel , which opens far below the energy at which the integrals are cut off ( 1.4 gev ) , but also in view of the uncertainties concerning the true scattering lengths , the cut - off high - energy ( @xmath31 gev ) tail of the dispersion integral , and the contributions of higher partial waves .",
    "already many years earlier , two independent unitarised quark models were developed and applied to the scalar sector , namely by the helsinki group , led by trnqvist @xcite , and several people from nijmegen @xcite , including two of the present authors . in the trnqvist approach , for each isospin a bare scalar @xmath6 state in the 1.41.6 gev region",
    "is coupled to all available pp channels , using @xmath18-symmetric coupling constants . as a result ,",
    "some dynamical resonances show up at much lower energies , alongside the unitarised states at the normal energies for @xmath5 @xmath6 states .",
    "originally , this only allowed to generate the @xmath4(980 ) and @xmath0(980 ) ( ref .",
    "@xcite , 1st paper ) . much later , inclusion of the adler - weinberg zero in the isoscalar case then also resulted in a light and broad @xmath1 , with pole position @xmath32 mev ( ref .",
    "@xcite , 2nd and 3rd paper ) .",
    "however , no @xmath3was found in the latter analysis either , which was probably due to the inclusion of an unphysical adler zero at a negative value of @xmath33 @xcite .    in the original nijmegen approach @xcite , one or more confined @xmath6 channels",
    "were coupled to all available pp as well as vector - vector ( vv ) channels , with confinement modelled through a harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) potential having flavour - independent spacings .",
    "unitarisation then leads to a distortion of the bare ho spectrum , and in the scalar case even gives rise to a doubling of all ground states , resulting in a _",
    "complete _ light scalar nonet , including the @xmath3 , with pole positions @xmath34  mev ( @xmath1 ) , @xmath35  mev ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath36  mev ( @xmath0(980 ) ) and @xmath37  mev ( @xmath4(980 ) ) .",
    "these parameter - free predictions from more than 20 years ago are still close to the present - day world averages .",
    "also note that the same model predicted earlier @xcite a long controversial @xmath38(1250 ) resonance , which was very recently confirmed @xcite in a multichannel analysis of @xmath39-wave @xmath29 data .",
    "+ a modern formulation of the coupled - channel model employed in ref .",
    "@xcite is the resonance - spectrum expansion ( rse ) @xcite , in which mesons in non - exotic channels scatter via an infinite set of intermediate @xmath40-channel @xmath6 states , i.e. , a kind of regge propagators @xcite .",
    "the confinement spectrum for these bare @xmath6 states can , in principle , be chosen freely , but in all phenomenological applications so far we have used an equidistant ho spectrum , as in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "because of the separability of the effective meson - meson interaction , the rse model can be solved in closed form .",
    "the relevant born and one - loop diagrams are depicted in fig .  1 , from which it is obvious that one can straightforwardly sum up the complete born series . for the meson - meson",
    " quark - antiquark vertex functions we take a delta shell in coordinate space , which amounts to a spherical bessel function in momentum space .",
    "such a transition potential represents the breaking of the string between a quark and an antiquark at a certain distance @xmath41 , with overall coupling strength @xmath42 , in the context of the @xmath5 model .",
    "spectroscopic applications of the rse are manifold . in the one - channel formalism , the @xmath3 was once again predicted in 2001 ( ref .",
    "@xcite , 1st paper ) , a year before its experimental confirmation . in the 2nd paper of ref .",
    "@xcite , the low mass of the @xmath43(2317 ) was shown to be due to its strong coupling to the @xmath24-wave @xmath44 threshold , an explanation that is now widely accepted .",
    "the 3rd paper of ref .",
    "@xcite presented a similar solution to the whole pattern of masses and widths of the charmed axial - vector mesons .",
    "multichannel versions of the rse model have been employed to produce a detailed fit of @xmath24-wave pp scattering and a complete light scalar nonet ( ref .",
    "@xcite , 1st paper ) , with very few parameters ( also see below ) , and to predict the @xmath45(2860 ) ( ref .",
    "@xcite , 2nd paper ) , shortly before its observation was publicly announced .",
    "finally , the rse has recently been applied to production processes @xcite as well , in the spectator approximation .",
    "most notably , it was shown that the rse results in a _ complex _ relation between production and scattering amplitudes ( papers 13 in ref .",
    "successful applications include the extraction of @xmath3 and @xmath1 signals from data on 3-body decay processes ( 4th paper in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the deduction of the string - breaking radius @xmath41 from production processes at very different energy scales ( 5th paper ) , and even the discovery of signals hinting at new vector charmonium states in @xmath46 data ( 6th paper ) . + _ _    [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]",
    "+      in ref .",
    "@xcite , 1st paper , hereafter referred to as bbkr , two of us ( evb , gr ) together with bugg and kleefeld applied the rse to @xmath24-wave pp scattering up to 1.2 gev , coupling the channels @xmath29 , @xmath19 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 for @xmath27 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 for @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , @xmath19 , @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , in the isoscalar case both an @xmath57 and an @xmath7 channel were included , so as to allow dynamical mixing to occur via the @xmath19 channel .",
    "the very few parameters , essentially only the overall coupling @xmath42 and the transition radius @xmath41 , were fitted to scattering data from various sources , for @xmath27 and for @xmath53 , and to the @xmath4(980 ) line shape , determined in a previous analysis , for @xmath58 . moreover , the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath41 varied less than @xmath59 from one case to another .",
    "overall , a good description of the data was achieved ( see bbkr for details ) .",
    "poles for the light scalars were found at ( all in mev ) + @xmath60 + no pole positions for the intermediate scalar mesons were reported in bbkr , as the fits were only carried out to 1.1 gev in the isovector case , and to 1.2 gev in the others . nevertheless , corresponding poles at higher energies were found , but these were of course quite unreliable .    in the following , we shall present very preliminary results for fits extended to higher energies , and with more channels included .",
    "+ fig .  2 ) .",
    "the deficient behaviour of the pp+vv phase above 1 gev seems to be mostly due to a too low - lying pole for the @xmath61 and a too broad one for the @xmath62 .",
    "the first four isoscalar poles we find are ( all in mev ) + @xmath63 +       + in the isotriplet case , we fit @xmath42 and @xmath41 , as well as the pseudoscalar mixing angle , to the @xmath4(980 ) line shape , just as in bbkr , but now with the vv channels ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) added . thus , the quality of the fit is further improved , and also the fitted mixing angle @xmath67 ( flavour basis ) becomes more realistic .",
    "the poles we find are @xmath68  mev ( second sheet ) for the @xmath4(980 ) and @xmath69  mev for the @xmath4(1450 ) , the latter being quite a bit too broad . +       + including the vector channels ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) in the isodoublet sector does not improve the fit , on the contrary .",
    "this will require a detailed investigation , which lies beyond the scope of this presentation .",
    "thus , we limit ourselves to extend the pp fit from bbkr up to 1.5  gev , using the full lass data , instead of the ones with the effect of the @xmath2(1430 ) subtracted . then , a good fit is obtained , with the very realistic pole positions @xmath70  mev for the @xmath3 and @xmath71  mev for the @xmath2(1430 ) .",
    "+ the preliminary results in this study indicate that a good description of both the light and the intermediate scalar mesons is feasible in the rse , taking into account additional sets of coupled channels that should become relevant at higher energies .",
    "however , for a detailed description of phase shifts above 1  gev , it may be necessary to include scalar - scalar channels as well , e.g.  to effectively deal with ( part of the ) @xmath72 decays in the isoscalar case .",
    "this could also require a procedure to make certain thresholds less sharp , in order to account for the large widths of some final - state resonances .",
