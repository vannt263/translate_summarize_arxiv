    "analysis of the power spectrum of fluctuations in the the large - scale distribution of matter ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , together with fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) provides powerful constraints on the physics of the very early universe . the most popular account for the origin of both power spectra",
    "is based upon quantum fluctuations generated during the inflationary epoch @xcite .",
    "subsequently , acoustic oscillations of the photon - baryon fluid distort this to produce the observed features in the angular power spectrum of temperature fluctuations in the cmb and the spatial power spectrum of matter density fluctuations .",
    "the two power spectra are different in that the cosmic microwave background is sensitive to the baryonic material , while the matter power spectrum probes the dominating dark matter .    in this context , there now exist determinations of the matter power spectrum on small angular scales due to recent _ sdss _",
    "@xcite , and _",
    "2d_f @xcite galaxy surveys as well as analysis of the lyman-@xmath0 forest @xcite at higher redshift and even smaller scales .",
    "this latter determination is particularly facilitated by the fact that at high redshift , the lyman-@xmath0 absorption systems are still within the quasi - linear regime so that an inference of the primordial power spectrum is relatively straightforward .",
    "the overall matter power spectrum deduced in this way is consistent with a standard @xmath8cdm cosmology , but as shown in figure [ figpk ] there is marginal evidence of a peculiar feature beginning near @xmath9 @xmath4 mpc@xmath5 which is not easily explained away by systematic errors @xcite .",
    "there is also at least a possibility for structure to exist in the region near @xmath10 @xmath4 mpc@xmath5 . in this paper",
    "we consider that such features may be a part of the primordial spectrum generated by new physics near the end of the inflation epoch .",
    ".1 in    regarding the cmb , data @xcite from _ wmap _ have placed stringent constraints on the cosmological parameters relevant to the observed power spectrum in the range of multipoles up to @xmath11 .",
    "the simplest prediction of the standard @xmath12 cosmology is that the primordial power spectrum should be strongly damped at higher multipoles due to photon diffusion ( silk damping ) and because more than one perturbation can fit within the depth of the surface of last scattering , and hence , be washed out .    of interest for the present work , however , is the recent accumulation of observations of the cmb power spectrum in the range @xmath13 by various groups ( _ cbi _ @xcite , _ acbar _",
    "@xcite , _ bima _",
    "@xcite , and _ vsa _",
    "these observations on the smallest angular scales are of particular interest as a test of this basic prediction of the standard inflation / photon - decoupling paradigm .",
    "the current data are summarized in figure [ cmbfig ] from which it is clear that the deduced power spectrum increases rather than decreases for large multipoles , particularly in the range @xmath14 .    0.3 in    the most likely interpretation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) of an excess power at high multipoles is a manifestation of the scattering of cmb photons by hot electrons in clusters known as the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite .",
    "although some contribution from the sz effect undoubtedly occurs , it is not yet conclusively established that this is the only possible interpretation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) of excess power on small angular scales . indeed",
    ", it has been deduced @xcite that explaining the excess power in the observed cmb spectrum requires that the mass density fluctuation amplitude parameter , @xmath15 , be near the upper end of the range of the values deduced via other independent means .",
    "another significant effect is the large cosmic variance .",
    "the uncertainties on the sz contribution are highly non - gaussian .",
    "they thus depend strongly upon whether or not the observed field happens to contain a group or cluster of galaxies .",
    "hence , there is large uncertainty in any deduced sz effect . in view of these uncertainties",
    ", an exploration of other possible explanations for this power excess seems warranted .    indeed ,",
    "alternative explanations exist for the generation of features in both the matter and cmb power spectra on small angular scales .",
    "for example , a flattening of the inflation generating effective potential near the end of inflation could produce such distortions on small angular scales @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", however , we consider another alternative originally proposed in @xcite whereby such distortions might arise from the resonant production of particles during large field inflation .",
    "this interpretation has the intriguing aspect that , if correct , an opportunity emerges to use the cmb and matter power spectra as probes of the planck scale ( @xmath16 gev ) particle spectrum .",
    "the prototypical scenario is that there is an inflaton @xmath17 which controls the mass of a fermion @xmath18 or a boson @xmath19 through the coupling @xmath20 \\bar{\\psi } \\psi - [ m_b^2 -    m_{pl}^2 g(\\frac{\\phi}{m_{pl } } ) ] \\chi^2 , \\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are fermion and boson masses , respectively , which are assumed to be of order @xmath23 . since by the definition of large field inflationary scenario @xmath24 and @xmath25 varies at least an order of magnitude , any natural order unity functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 will lead to a cancellation of the masses during the evolution of slow roll inflation . due to this cancellation , when @xmath28 and/or @xmath29 , the effective mass of @xmath18 and @xmath19 is varying nonadiabatically ( since the inflaton field variation time rate is also typically not too far from the hubble expansion rate @xmath30 )",
    ". leads approximately to @xmath31 for fermion mass term where @xmath32 ] during this nonadiabatic period , there is efficient particle production which can be thought of as a kind of resonant particle production .    in @xcite , the effect of the resonant _ fermionic _",
    "particle production was taken into account neglecting the nonadiabatic effects on the modes outside of the horizon .",
    "this leads to a bump - like structure in the primordial power spectrum .",
    "however , @xcite considered the nonadiabatic effects of bosonic particle production on the modes outside the horizon .",
    "their claim is that the primordial power spectrum is modified by a steplike structure rather than a bumplike structure .",
    "given that their analysis was for bosonic particle production while we are going to deal with fermionic production following @xcite , and given that the subtle effect of @xcite ( which was only approximately computed numerically ) requires more detailed attention to unambiguously establish the change in the qualitative behavior of the primordial spectral feature , we will in this paper consider only the semianalytic results of @xcite when fitting to data .",
    "however , because of this omission of the nonadiabatic effect , this result should only be considered indicative of the type of constraints one can obtain from the latest data .",
    "a detailed analysis of the nonadiabatic effects will be considered in a future publication .",
    "planck - scale mass particles generically exist in planck scale compactification schemes of string theory from the kaluza - klein states , winding modes , and the massive ( excited ) string modes .",
    "hence , the existence of planck - scale mass particles which couple to the inflaton is a generic situation .",
    "what is perhaps not generic in the scenario considered in this paper is that the mass of the planck - scale particle lies in the @xmath33-fold range of the inflaton accessible to observation .",
    "even with all of these favorable assumptions , we find only marginal hints for the existence of such a particle from fits to current data .",
    "more specifically , we find marginal hints for a bump at a scale of @xmath34 ( and 0.2 ) @xmath35 mpc@xmath5 in the primordial spectrum due to production of fermions of mass @xmath36 with an @xmath37 weak coupling to the inflaton .",
    "the order of presentation will be as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly review and clarify the semianalytic results of @xcite and then set up the parameterization of the primordial spectrum fitting function . in sections",
    "iii and iv , we briefly discuss the matter power spectrum parameterization and the cmb power spectrum ( including the sz effect which is the more conservative interpretation of the excess power at large @xmath38 values ) .",
    "section v is devoted to the discussion of the fitting procedure and the fit results to the matter and the cmb spectrum .",
    "finally , we conclude in section vi .",
    "in the basic inflationary picture , a rapid early expansion of the universe is achieved through the vacuum energy from an inflaton field . in the minimal extension from the basic picture considered here ,",
    "the inflaton is postulated to couple to at least one massive particle whose mass is order of the of the inflaton field value .",
    "this particle is then resonantly produced as the field obtains a critical value during inflation .",
    "if even a small fraction of the energy in the inflaton field is extracted in this way , it can produce features in the primordial power spectrum .",
    "in particular , there will be excess power in the spectrum at the angular scale corresponding to when the epoch of resonant particle creation crossed the hubble radius .    in the simplest slow roll approximation @xcite for the generation of density perturbations during inflation ,",
    "the amplitude , @xmath39 , of a density fluctuation when it crosses the hubble radius is just , @xmath40 where @xmath30 is the expansion rate , and @xmath41 is the velocity of the inflaton field when the comoving wave number @xmath42 crosses the hubble radius during inflation . if resonant particle production drains energy from the inflaton field , then the conjugate momentum in the field @xmath41 decreases .",
    "this causes an increase in @xmath39 ( primordial power spectrum ) for those wave numbers which exit the horizon during the resonant particle production epoch .",
    "of course when @xmath43 is changing due to particle production , @xmath44 may not be negligible , resulting in corrections to eq .",
    "( [ pert ] ) . in @xcite ,",
    "this correction was considered and found to be @xmath45 for the particle production of interest for the fits of this paper .    the inflaton field",
    "is then postulated to have a simple yukawa coupling to a fermion field @xmath18 of mass @xmath46 in the form ,",
    "@xmath47 including this new coupling , the equation of motion for the inflaton field becomes @xmath48 for @xmath49 fermions of mass @xmath46 coupled to the inflaton .",
    "the effective mass of the fermion is @xmath50 , which vanishes for a critical value of the inflaton field , @xmath51 .",
    "resonant fermion production will then occur in a narrow range of inflaton field amplitude around @xmath52 .    as in @xcite",
    "we label the epoch at which particles are created by an asterisk .",
    "so the cosmic scale factor is labeled @xmath53 at the time @xmath54 at which resonant particle production occurs . considering a small interval around this epoch",
    ", one can treat @xmath55 as approximately constant ( slow roll inflation ) .",
    "the number density @xmath56 of particles can be taken as zero before @xmath54 and afterwards as @xmath57^{3}$ ] .",
    "the fermion vacuum expectation value can thus be written , @xmath58^{3 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\approx n_*~\\theta(t - t_*)\\exp{[-3h_*(t - t_*)]}~~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now inserting this relation into the equation of motion for the inflaton field ( eq .",

    "the subscript ` @xmath42 ' indicates the inflaton effective potential value when a particular wave number @xmath42 crosses the hubble radius during inflation ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the scale factor and effective inflaton potential at the end of inflation , and @xmath67 is the matter energy density after reheating to the standard hot big bang friedmann cosmology .",
    "this expression assumes that instantaneous transitions occur between the various regimes , and that the universe behaves as if matter - dominated during reheating .",
    "the values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 determined from observation directly relate to the inflaton coupling @xmath72 and fermion mass @xmath46 , for a given inflation model . when the back reaction is not important , we can write @xmath73 which uses the approximation @xcite for the particle production bogoliubov coefficient to be @xmath74 note that this approximation does not depend on the particular form of the inflaton potential .",
    "its main assumptions are only that the particle mass being produced is nearly negligible during the resonant production ( which is an excellent assumption for our case ) and that the effective - mass time variation due to the inflaton time variation dominates over the contribution due to the frw expansion .",
    "hence , when we carry out the fits , we can approximately marginalize over the spectral index ( since each constant spectral index corresponds to a different inflationary model in which the spectral index is approximately constant ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath69 in this approximation of negligible back reaction can be related directly to the coupling constant @xmath72 by noting that @xmath75 where we have used the usual approximation for the primordial slow roll inflationary spectrum @xcite .",
    "this means that regardless of the exact nature of the inflationary scenario , for any fixed inflationary spectrum @xmath76 without the back reaction , we have the particle production giving us a bump of the form eq .  ( [ eq : fit ] ) with the parameter @xmath69 expressed in terms of the coupling constant through eq .",
    "( [ eq : alamrelation ] ) .",
    "given that the cmb normalization requires @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 hence , for @xmath79 , both @xmath80 and @xmath81 are possible , satisfying perturbativity .",
    "as will be seen in the sections below , our best fits will indeed give @xmath79 .",
    "when @xmath49 and @xmath72 are sufficiently large that the back reaction becomes important ( when the naively computed @xmath82 ) , . ]",
    "the back reaction reduces @xcite the actual amplitude of the peak relative to the perturbative value given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : alamrelation ] ) .",
    "before we conclude this section , we would like to explicitly state further caveats to using eq .",
    "( [ pert ] ) in computing the primordial perturbation spectrum :    1 .   instead of the usual long wavelength gauge invariant curvature perturbation",
    "variable implicit in using eq .",
    "( [ pert ] ) , the gauge invariant gravitational potential must be recomputed incorporating the coupling of eq .",
    "( [ eq : yukawacoupling ] ) .",
    "2 .   even with the usual gauge invariant curvature perturbation formalism , eq .  ( [ pert ] ) neglects the change in pressure that occurs due to the particle production . even considering the adiabatic perturbation component , this would change the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ pert ] ) .",
    "3 .   the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ pert ] ) also obtains a contribution from the particle production which we are neglecting .",
    "4 .   as pointed out by @xcite , perhaps the most significant effect that has been neglected",
    "is the nonadiabatic pressure change .",
    "a more detailed investigation of these neglected effects will be deferred to a future publication .",
    "it is straight forward to determine the matter power spectrum to compare with that deduced from large - scale structure surveys @xcite and the lyman-@xmath0 forest @xcite . to convert the amplitude of the perturbation as wave number @xmath42 enters the horizon , @xmath39 , to the present - day power spectrum , @xmath83 , which describes the amplitude of the fluctuation at a fixed time",
    ", one must make use of a transfer function , @xmath84 @xcite which is easily computed using the code cmbfast @xcite for various sets of cosmological parameters ( e.g.  @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath8 , @xmath87 ) . an adequate approximate expression for the structure power spectrum is @xmath88 this expression is only valid in the linear regime , which in comoving wave number is up to approximately @xmath89 mpc@xmath5 and therefore adequate for our purposes .",
    "however , we also correct for the nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "features in the primordial power spectrum will also appear in the observed cmb temperature fluctuations .",
    "the connection between the resonant particle creation and cmb temperature fluctuations is straightforward . as usual ,",
    "temperature fluctuations are expanded in spherical harmonics , @xmath90 ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) .",
    "the anisotropies are then described by the angular power spectrum , @xmath93 , as a function of multipole number @xmath38 .",
    "one then merely requires the conversion from perturbation spectrum @xmath83 to angular power spectrum @xmath94 .",
    "this is also easily accomplished using the code cmbfast @xcite .",
    "as input to cmbfast we adopt the usual power law primordial spectrum plus the perturbation due to resonant particle production . for speed , cmbfast does not compute all @xmath94 , but uses a spline fit to interpolate .",
    "we have checked the stability of the cmbfast results when adding such features to the power spectrum by increasing the number of @xmath94 explicitly computed .",
    "the results were convergent even for the default spline fits of cmbfast . when converting to the angular power spectrum , the amplitude of the narrow particle creation feature in @xmath39 is spread over many values of @xmath38 .",
    "hence , the particle creation feature looks like a broad peak which is easily accommodated even when implementing spline fits .      it has been proposed @xcite that the observed spectrum at high @xmath38 is explained by the sz effect . however , the amplitude of the sz contribution to the power spectrum is very sensitive to the parameter @xmath15 describing rms mass fluctuation within a fiducial 8 @xmath95 mpc sphere .",
    "the amplitude of the expected sz peak scales as @xmath96 .    explaining the excess power in the observed cmb spectrum requires that the mass density fluctuation amplitude parameter , @xmath15 , be slightly above unity @xcite .",
    "however , a variety of independent measures including weak lensing @xcite , galaxy velocity fields @xcite , galaxy clusters at high redshift @xcite , x - ray emitting clusters @xcite , and the independent value obtained by the _ wmap _",
    "fit @xcite to the lower multipole data all favor a mean value in the range @xmath97 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "note that even a slight reduction of the amplitude parameter by 10% is sufficient to reduce the magnitude of distortion by more than a factor of two .",
    "for the present purposes we adopt a conservative value of @xmath98 as a reasonable prior distribution based upon the various independent measures of @xmath15 .    in what follows we fit the amplitude of the sz contribution using the sz power spectrum calculated in @xcite based upon the analytic halo formalism @xcite .",
    "this analytic form has been shown @xcite to adequately represent the power spectra deduced from numerical simulations .",
    "we have made a multi - dimensional markov chain monte - carlo analysis @xcite of the mass power spectrum based upon the combined @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and lyman-@xmath0 data in models with and without resonant particle creation during inflation to alter the primordial fluctuation spectrum .",
    "we also have independently analyzed the cmb using the combined _ wmap , cbi , acbar , _ and _ vsa _ data .",
    "in addition , we made a total analysis based upon the combined mass and cmb power spectra .    for simplicity and speed in the present study we only marginalized over the five parameters which do not alter the matter or cmb transfer functions .",
    "hence , the set of free parameters in the analysis is ( @xmath101 ) , where @xmath102 is the spectral index , @xmath103 is the overall amplitude of the primordial power spectrum , and @xmath104 is the overall amplitude of the sz effect which we relate to an effective @xmath105 parameter for the sz effect .",
    "the true @xmath15 parameter , however , is determined by @xmath103 once the power spectrum and transfer functions are fixed . as usual , both @xmath102 and @xmath103 are normalized at @xmath106 mpc@xmath5 . as noted above , we adopt a conservative prior of @xmath107 as opposed to the best fit combined _ wmap _ analysis value of @xmath108 . for this illustrative study",
    "all other parameters for this analysis were fixed at the optimum _ wmap _ parameters @xcite , i.e. ( @xmath109 .",
    "one expects that different results would arise by optimizing over other parameters , e.g. @xmath110 , etc .",
    "however , for the present exploratory study , we only wish to identify angular scales which might be of interest for future study . for this purpose ,",
    "a simple five parameter marginalization is adequate since such parameters do not produce the kind of spectrum bump of interest here .",

    "the most recent _ sdss _ matter power spectrum extends into the nonlinear regime , but is probably not reliable @xcite for the last band widths above @xmath112 mpc@xmath5 .",

    ", those cmb observations favor this interpretation over the conventional sz plus @xmath12 models at the level of @xmath129 . however , the _ bima _ data set at @xmath130 is a crucial test of this possible interpretation . if the power spectrum is as high at these l - values as the _ bima _ data imply , then an sz interpretation with a large @xmath15",
    "is favored .",
    "contours of @xmath69 and @xmath70 consistent with the combined cmb and matter power - spectrum constraints are shown on figure [ contourfigtot ] . here",

    "nevertheless , the feature with @xmath135mpc@xmath5 and @xmath136 which is clearly seen in the matter power spectrum of figure [ figpk ] is still apparent in the combined analysis .",
    "the diminished significance in the combined analysis is to be expected since this bump is entirely due to the lyman-@xmath0 data and is not detectable in the cmb .    regarding other parameters in the analysis , it is not surprising that we deduce values very near to the _ wmap _ @xcite optimum results , e.g.   @xmath137 , @xmath138 .",

    "the combined cmb + matter power spectrum would imply an optimum feature at @xmath131mpc@xmath5 and @xmath132 . however , given that the cmb results may be attributed to the sz effect and that the matter power spectrum is very uncertain at this scale , we propose that the most likely possibility could be the feature in the matter power spectrum deduced from the lyman-@xmath0 absorption structures at a scale of @xmath139 mpc@xmath5 and @xmath140 .",
    "either of these features would correspond to the resonant creation of a particle with @xmath141 m@xmath7 and a yukawa coupling constant between the fermion species and the inflaton of @xmath142 for a single fermion species .",
    "obviously there is a need for more precise determinations of the primordial matter power spectrum on the scale of 0.1 to 10 mpc .",
    "indeed , the lyman-@xmath0 forest constraints and method are currently under revision and new results are expected shortly which may alter the conclusions presented here .",
    "there is also a need for more precise determinations of the sz contribution to the cmb on the scale of @xmath143 .",
    "we further note that the present analysis has neglected the possibility of nonadiabatic effects .",
    "based upon previous studies @xcite of nonadiabatic isocurvature fluctuations on the matter power spectrum and cmb , we would expect that the introduction of non - gaussian isocurvature fluctuations could add excess power on small angular scales and hence could decrease the significance of the features identified here .",
    "they would not , however , naturally produce the kind of bump of interest here , and hence would not easily explain such features away .    in spite of these caveats ,",
    "we conclude that if the present analysis is correct , this may be one of the first hints at observational evidence of new particle physics at the planck scale .",
    "indeed , one expects a plethora of particles at the planck scale , particularly in the context of string theory , the leading candidate for a consistent theory of quantum gravity . perhaps , the presently observed power spectra contain the first suggestion that such particles may have not only existed in the early universe , but coupled to the inflaton field , and thereby , left a relic signature of their existence in the primordial power spectrum .",
