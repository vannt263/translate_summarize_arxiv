    "throughout , @xmath1 is a probability space and @xmath0 a convex cone of real random variables on @xmath1 .",

    "essentially two results are provided . in the first , @xmath2 is a finitely additive probability , while @xmath2 is @xmath5-additive in the second .",
    "the reference probability @xmath11 is @xmath5-additive .    in economic applications , for instance",
    ", @xmath0 could be a collection of random variables dominated by stochastic integrals of the type @xmath12 , where the semimartingale @xmath13 describes the stock - price process , and @xmath14 is a predictable @xmath13-integrable process ranging in some class of admissible trading strategies ; see @xcite .",
    "however , even if our results apply to any convex cone @xmath0 , this paper has been mostly written having a linear space in mind .",
    "in fact , if @xmath0 is a linear space , since @xmath6 whenever @xmath7 , condition yields @xmath15 therefore , the addressed problem can be motivated as follows .",

    "suppose @xmath13 is adapted to a filtration @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a constant random variable for some @xmath20 .",
    "a classical problem in mathematical finance is the existence of an _ equivalent martingale measure _ , that is , a @xmath5-additive probability @xmath2 on @xmath3 such that @xmath21 and @xmath13 is a @xmath22-martingale under @xmath2 .",
    "but , with a suitable choice of the linear space @xmath0 , an equivalent martingale measure is exactly a @xmath5-additive solution @xmath2 of .",
    "it suffices to take @xmath0 as the linear space generated by the random variables @xmath23 note also that , if @xmath0 is taken to be the convex cone generated by such random variables , a @xmath5-additive solution @xmath2 of is an _ equivalent super - martingale measure_.    equivalent martingale measures are usually requested to be @xmath5-additive , but their economic interpretation is preserved if they are only finitely additive .",
    "thus , to look for finitely additive equivalent martingale measures seems to be reasonable .",
    "we refer to @xcite-@xcite and the beginning of section [ st3 ] for a discussion on this point .",
    "equivalent martingale measures ( both @xmath5-additive and finitely additive ) are the obvious motivation for our problem , and this explains the title of this paper .",
    "but they are not the only motivation .",
    "there are other issues which can be reduced to the existence of a probability @xmath2 satisfying for a suitable linear space @xmath0 ( possibly without requesting @xmath21 ) .",
    "one example are equivalent probability measures with given marginals ; see example [ u6 ] .",
    "another example is compatibility of conditional distributions ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "a last example is de finetti s coherence principle and related topics ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "this paper consists of two results ( theorems [ t1 ] and [ p3b ] ) some corollaries and a long final section of examples .    in theorem [ t1 ] , under the assumption that each @xmath7 is bounded , the existence of a finitely additive probability @xmath2 satisfying is given various characterizations .",
    "as an example , one such @xmath2 exists if and only if @xmath24 is a tight collection of probability laws on the real line .",
    "furthermore , under some conditions , theorem [ t1 ] also applies when the elements of @xmath0 are not bounded ; see corollary [ fol7f3b ] .",
    "theorem [ p3b ] is our main result .",
    "no assumption on the convex cone @xmath0 is required . a @xmath5-additive probability @xmath2 satisfying is shown to exist if and only if @xmath25 for all @xmath7 , some constant @xmath26 and some @xmath5-additive probability @xmath27 such that @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , when applied with @xmath29 , the above condition amounts to the existence of a @xmath5-additive probability @xmath2 satisfying and @xmath30 for some constants @xmath31 .",
    "some applications of theorems [ t1 ] and [ p3b ] are given in section [ sg3 ] .",
    "in the sequel , as in section [ mot ] , @xmath0 is a convex cone of real random variables on the fixed probability space @xmath1 .",

    "* it may be that esfa s are available while esm s fail to exist . * in option pricing ,",
    "when @xmath0 is a linear space , esfa s give arbitrage - free prices just as esm s .",

    "an extreme situation of this type is exhibited in example [ s4r ] .",

    "suppose in fact that @xmath0 is generated by the bounded random variables @xmath199 .",

    "second , example 7 of @xcite can be modified , preserving the possible economic meaning ( provided the @xmath294 are regarded as asset prices ) but allowing for esm s to exist .",
    "let @xmath324 be a random variable , independent of the sequence @xmath325 , with values in @xmath326 . to fix ideas , suppose @xmath327 for all @xmath102 .",
