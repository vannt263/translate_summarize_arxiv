    "the @xmath4 expansion @xcite is the only analytic expansion of qcd in the whole energy region , that provides a definition of @xmath5 bound states , whose masses and widths behave as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "light mesons are also described within chiral perturbation theory ( chpt)@xcite , which is the qcd low energy effective theory , built as the most general effective lagrangian compatible with all qcd symmetries , involving the pseudo nambu - goldstone bosons of the qcd spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "meson - meson scattering amplitudes become an expansion in momenta and masses , generically denoted @xmath8 , over a scale @xmath9 gev . at each order",
    ", the chpt lagrangian contains _ all terms _ compatible with qcd symmetries , multiplied by low energy constants ( lecs ) , that encode the qcd dynamics and renormalize divergences order by order .",
    "the correct qcd leading order @xmath4 behavior of @xmath10 , the pseudo nambu - goldstone boson masses and the lecs , is well known and chpt amplitudes have no cutoffs or subtraction constants where spurious @xmath1 dependences could hide .",
    "note that , in order to apply the @xmath4 expansion , the renormalization scale @xmath11 has been chosen between @xmath12 0.5 and 1 gev , following @xcite .",
    "( also , in fig .",
    "[ ncsu3 ] we show that outside this band the generated vector mesons will start deviating from their well established @xmath5 behavior ) .",
    "resonances are not present in the chpt lagrangian but can be described using chpt as input in a dispersion relation @xcite .",
    "the main idea is that partial waves , @xmath13 , of definite isospin and angular momentum satisfy an elastic unitarity condition : @xmath14 while the chpt expansion @xmath15 , @xmath16 , satisfies it only perturbatively : @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath18 has a right cut ( @xmath19 ) a left cut ( @xmath20 ) , and possible pole contributions ( @xmath21 ) , we can write a dispersion relation as follows @xmath22 in the elastic approximation , unitarity allows us to evaluate _ exactly _",
    "@xmath23 on the @xmath19 .",
    "the subtraction constants can be approximated with chpt since they involve amplitudes evaluated at @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "these three subtractions imply that @xmath20 is dominated by its low energy part , and well estimated by chpt as @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath21 counts as @xmath27 and only gives sizable contributions much below threshold in scalar waves @xcite , thus we neglect it here for simplicity .",
    "all in all , one finds the iam formula @xcite : @xmath28 remarkably , this simple equation ensures elastic unitarity , matches chpt at low energies , describes fairly well data up to somewhat less than 1 gev , and generates the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 resonances as poles on the second riemann sheet , with chpt parameters rather similar to those from standard chpt . the iam can be easily extended to higher orders or  without a dispersive justification yet ",
    "generalized within a coupled channel formalism @xcite , generating also the @xmath33 , @xmath34 and the octet @xmath35 .    by scaling with @xmath1 the chpt parameters in the iam , we can determine the @xmath1 dependence of the resonances masses and widths @xcite , defined from the pole position as @xmath36 , and compare it with the @xmath5 scaling to determine if the resonance is predominantly of a @xmath5 nature .",
    "however , _ a priori _ , one should be careful _ not to take @xmath1 too large , and in particular to avoid the @xmath37 limit , because it is a weakly interacting limit_. as shown above , the iam relies on the fact that the exact elastic @xmath19 contribution dominates the dispersion relation .",
    "since the iam describes the data and the resonances , within , say 10 to 20% errors , this means that at @xmath0 the other contributions are not approximated badly .",
    "but meson loops , responsible for the @xmath19 , scale as @xmath38 whereas the inaccuracies due to the approximations scale partly as @xmath6 .",
    "thus , we can estimate that those 10 to 20% errors at @xmath0 may become 100% errors at , say @xmath39 or @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "hence we have never shown results @xcite beyond @xmath41 , and even beyond @xmath40 they should be interpreted with care .",
    "of course , there could be special cases in which the iam could still work for very large @xmath1 , as it is has been shown for the vector channel for qcd @xcite .",
    "but that is not the case for the scalar channel , which , if used for too large @xmath1 may lead to inconsistencies @xcite for some values of the lecs .",
    "the @xmath1 scaling of iam resonances was studied to one - loop in coupled channels in @xcite and to two - loops in the elastic case in @xcite .",
    "thus , fig.[ncsu3 ] shows the behavior of the @xmath29 , @xmath42 and @xmath31 masses and widths found in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath42 neatly follow the expected behavior for a @xmath5 state : @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the bands cover the uncertainty in @xmath45 gev where to scale the lecs with @xmath1 .",
    "note also in fig.1(top - right ) that , for that set of lecs , _ outside this @xmath11 range _",
    "the @xmath29 meson starts deviating from a a @xmath5 behavior .",
    "something similar occurs to the @xmath46 .",
    "consequently , we can not apply the @xmath1 scaling at an arbitrary @xmath11 value , if the well established @xmath29 and @xmath42 @xmath5 nature is to be reproduced .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath31 shows a different behavior from that of a pure @xmath5 : _ near @xmath1=3 _ both its mass and width grow with @xmath1 , i.e. its pole moves away from the real axis .",
    "of course , far from @xmath0 , and for some choices of lecs and @xmath11 , the sigma pole might turn back to the real axis @xcite , as seen in fig.1 ( bottom - right ) .",
    "but , as commented above , the iam is less reliable for large @xmath1 , and even if we trust this behavior it only suggests that there might be a subdominant @xmath47 component @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have to make sure that the lecs used fit data and reproduce the @xmath5 behavior for the vectors .    since loop terms are important in determining the scalar pole position , but are @xmath4 suppressed compared to tree level terms with lecs , it is relevant to check the @xmath48 results with an @xmath27 iam calculation .",
    "this was done within @xmath49 chpt in @xcite .",
    "we defined a @xmath50-like function to measure how close a resonance is from a @xmath5 @xmath1 behavior .",
    "first , we used that @xmath50-like function at @xmath48 to show that it is not possible for the @xmath31 to behave predominantly as a @xmath47 while describing simultaneously the data and the @xmath29 @xmath5 behavior , thus _ confirming the robustness of the conclusions for @xmath1 close to 3_. next , we obtained a @xmath27 data fit  where the @xmath29 @xmath5 behavior was imposed ",
    "whose @xmath1 behavior for the @xmath29 and @xmath31 mass and width is shown in fig.2 .",
    "note that both @xmath51 and @xmath52 grow with @xmath1 , near @xmath0 confirming the @xmath48 result of a non @xmath5 dominant component .",
    "however , as @xmath1 grows further , between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where we still trust the iam results , @xmath51 becomes constant and @xmath52 starts decreasing .",
    "this may hint to a _",
    "subdominant @xmath5 component _ , arising as loop diagrams become suppressed as @xmath1 grows .",
    "finally , we checked how big this @xmath31 @xmath5 component can be made , by forcing the @xmath31 to behave as a @xmath5 using the above mentioned @xmath50-like measure .",
    "we found that in the best case , this subdominant @xmath5 component could become dominant around @xmath55 , at best , but always with an @xmath37 mass above roughly 1 gev instead of its physical @xmath56 mev value .",
    "we have seen that , within chpt unitarized with the iam , the @xmath1 behavior of @xmath57 states is clearly identified whereas scalar mesons behave differently near @xmath0 . here",
    "we want to emphasize again @xcite , what can and _ what can not _ be concluded from this behavior and clarify some frequent questions and doubts raised in this meeting , private discusions and the literature :      _ the of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 _ in meson - meson scattering _ does not behave as a @xmath57_. why `` dominant '' ? because , most likely , scalars are a mixture of different kind of states .",
    "if the @xmath57 was _ dominant _ , they would behave as the @xmath29 or the @xmath42 in fig.1 .",
    "_ but a smaller fraction of @xmath57 can not be excluded . _",
    "actually , it is somewhat favored in our @xmath27 analysis @xcite .    _",
    "two meson and some tetraquark states@xcite have a consistent `` qualitative '' behavior _ , i.e. , both disappear in the meson - meson scattering continuum as @xmath1 increases . our results are not able yet to establish the nature of that dominant component .",
    "the most we could state is that the behavior of two - meson states or some tetraquarks might be qualitatively consistent .",
    "the @xmath3 limit has been studied in @xcite .",
    "apart from its mathematical interest , it could have some physical relevance if the data and the large @xmath1 uncertainty on the choice of scale were more accurate .",
    "nevertheless :      as commented above , _ a priori the iam is not reliable in the @xmath3 limit _ , since it corresponds to a weakly interacting theory , where exact unitarity becomes less relevant in confront of other approximations made in the iam derivation .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that it might work well in that limit in the vector channel of qcd but not in the scalar channel .",
    "another reason to limit ourselves to @xmath1 not too far from 3 is that in our calculations we have not included the @xmath59 , whose mass is related to the @xmath60 anomaly and scales as @xmath61 . nevertheless , if in our calculations we keep @xmath62 , its mass would be @xmath63mev and thus pions are still the only relevant degrees of freedom for the scalar channel in the @xmath31 region .    _",
    "contrary to the leading @xmath4 behavior , the @xmath3 limit does not give information on the `` dominant component '' of light scalars .",
    "_ the reason was commented above : in contrast to @xmath57 states , that become bound , two - meson and some tetraquark states dissolve in the continuum as @xmath3 .",
    "thus , even if we started with an infinitesimal @xmath57 component in a resonance , for a sufficiently large @xmath1 it may become dominant , and beyond that @xmath1 the associated pole would behave as a @xmath57 state although the original state only had an infinitesimal admixture of @xmath57 . also , since the mixings of different components could change with @xmath1 , a too large @xmath1 could alter significantly the original mixings .",
    "actually , this is what happens for the one - loop iam @xmath31 resonance for @xmath37 , but it does _ not _ necessarily mean that the `` correct interpretation ... is that the @xmath31 pole is a conventional @xmath57 meson environed by heavy pion clouds '' @xcite .",
    "that the scalars are not conventional , is simply seen by comparing them in figs.1 and 2 with the `` conventional '' @xmath29 and @xmath42 in those very same figures . a large two - meson component is consistent , but the @xmath3 of the one - loop unitarized chpt pole in the scalar channel limit is not unique @xcite given the uncertainty in the chiral parameters .",
    "moreover , for some lecs the scalar channel one - loop iam in the @xmath3 limit can lead to phenomenological inconsistencies @xcite since poles can even move to negative mass square ( weird ) , to infinity or to a positive mass square .",
    "that is one of the reasons why in the figures here and in @xcite we only plot up to @xmath41 , but not 100 , or a million .",
    "hence , robust conclusions on the dominant light scalar component , can be obtained not too far from real life , say @xmath64 or 30 , for a @xmath11 choice between roughly @xmath65 and 1 gev , that simultaneously ensures the @xmath5 dependence for the @xmath29 and @xmath42 mesons .",
    "note , however , that under these same conditions the two - loop iam still finds a dominant non-@xmath5 component , but , in addition , a hint of a @xmath5 subdominant component , which is not conventional in the sense that it appears at a much higher mass than the physical @xmath31 .",
    "this may support the existence of a second @xmath5 scalar octet above 1 gev @xcite .    _ in summary , the dominant component of light scalars as generated from unitarized one loop chpt scattering amplitudes does not behave as a @xmath57 state as @xmath1 increases not far from @xmath0 . when using the two loop iam result in su(2 ) , below @xmath6615 or 30 , there is a hint of a subdominant @xmath57 component , but arising at roughly twice the mass of the physical @xmath31 . _      t.  n.  truong , phys .",
