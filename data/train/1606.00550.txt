    "equilibrium , denoted by the self - similarity ( or self - preservation ) of the mean profiles under proper normalization @xcite , is one of the most fundamental concepts in turbulent boundary layers ( tbls ) .",
    "it is classified into two broad categories @xcite .",
    "one case involves an approximate equilibrium where the velocity and reynolds stresses are self - similar over most of the boundary layer and the other , an exact equilibrium where the self - similarity is observed over the entire layer thickness .",
    "the zero - pressure - gradient ( zpg ) tbl , containing two independent ( inner and outer ) scales with the similarity properties expressed as the law of the wall and defect law @xcite , belongs to the first category .",
    "in contrast , the sink - flow boundary layer , a counterpart of the laminar falkner - skan boundary layers and a generic jerrefy - hamel flow constrained by two smooth plane surfaces , possesses many interesting properties @xcite .",
    "this flow has an invariant velocity profile , a zero mean entrainment , radial mean streamlines , a constant reynolds number ( @xmath2 ) and a constant friction coefficient along the stream , rendering it as the purest example of an exact equilibrium tbl @xcite and has triggered numerous studies on the scaling and flow structures @xcite .",
    "whilst the laminar sink flow is one of the few known exact solutions of the navier - stokes equations @xcite , there is no known solution for the turbulent sink flow due to the reynolds shear stress .",
    "this is analogous to the zpg tbl , where various models are developed for the unclosed mean momentum equation .",
    "notable works include an asymptotic logarithmic law for the mean velocity @xcite , the mixing length hypothesis @xcite , etc .",
    "however , to emphasize , except for the log - law , few are known for the sink flow tbls . a crucial question concerns how the exact equilibrium state is produced @xcite and whether the state is robust under various boundary conditions .",
    "this is important because so far only the sink flow tbl is known to display the exact equilibrium state - first shown by @xcite and @xcite . to pursue more possible self - similarities in wall flows ,",
    "a general theoretical framework is thus needed which is developed in this paper .    here",
    ", we use the lie group symmetry analysis @xcite to derive the self - similarity equation for boundary layers including effects of blowing and suction .",
    "it follows a recent work by @xcite with a notable difference , viz .",
    ", it transforms the mean mass and mean momentum equations to an streamwise independent ordinary differential equation ( ode ) and presents the necessary boundary conditions for the existence of the exact equilibrium state .",
    "it systematically unifies the falkner - skan laminar flows and the sink flow tbls having different pressure gradients and blowing / suction , thus covering a wide class of equilibrium flows and perhaps fostering a more general study in future .",
    "note that recently two dimensional stagnation point flows have been discussed by kolomenskiy & moffatt @xcite , where a class of similarity solutions ( exact equilibrium states ) are obtained by ( numerically ) solving an ode transformed from the two - dimensional navier - stokes equation .",
    "in fact , as will be shown later , their ode and ours become the same under specific conditions .",
    "moreover , the current approach is more general than previous scaling analysis @xcite where specific scales are proposed for specific flows .",
    "also note that while only the laminar cases ( blasius and falkner - skan ) have been studied through a symmetry analysis by @xcite , as well as the smooth wall turbulent boundary layers by @xcite , we extend the symmetry analysis to include the reynolds shear stress and blowing / suction .    more importantly , we establish a similarity transformation for the mean velocity profile covering ranges of blowing / suction strengths .",
    "this transformation is found to be a group invariant ( in most of the flow region except for the buffer layer ) through a generalized symmetry analysis and maps different @xmath1 profiles under different blowing / suction conditions into a universal profile under no blowing / suction .",
    "the latter reversely enables calculations of all quantities in the mean mass and momentum equations - in good agreement with dns data @xcite .",
    "the results indicate that the wall blowing / suction not only preserves the equilibrium condition , but also leads to a new similarity among different blowing / suction strengths .",
    "the paper is thus organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to a symmetry analysis of the mean mass and streamwise mean momentum equations , resulting a generalized ode for various flows mentioned above .",
    "the similarity transformation for @xmath1 is presented in section iii ; also included is a prediction of the mean velocities and reynolds stresses .",
    "section iv presents the conclusions and discussions .",
    "the incompressible , two - dimensional navier - stokes equations with the standard boundary layer approximation ( nsbl ) read @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath1 , @xmath0 indicate mean streamwise ( @xmath5 ) and wall normal @xmath6 velocities ; @xmath7 is the reynolds shear stress .",
    "note that a zero @xmath8 indicates the laminar flow .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where a zero @xmath12 indicates the non - penetrating wall and else for suction ( a negative @xmath12 ) and blowing ( a positive @xmath12 ) effects .",
    "note that the origin location @xmath13 is set at the sink apex shown in figure [ fig : sink ] , to explain the dilation transformation defined later .",
    "similar to the analysis of the laminar boundary layer flow , we introduce the streamfunction to eliminate the mass equation .",
    "the novelty is that , due to blowing / suction effects , the velocities are : @xmath14 one can check that ( [ eq : psia ] ) always satisfies ( [ eq : mass ] ) as long as @xmath15 , common to previous analysis @xcite",
    ". therefore , ( [ eq : mme ] ) written in stream function reads @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are additional compared to the falkner - skan equation . following the procedure in @xcite , here we search for the dilation symmetry permitted by ( [ eq : mmepsi ] ) ( more discussion see appendix ) . denoting @xmath19 and substituting ( [ eq : dilationser ] ) into ( [ eq : mmepsi ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath20 the dilation symmetry requires : @xmath21 where four of the six free coefficients , i.e. @xmath22 ( i=1,2,  ,6 ) , can be determined from ( [ eq : ai ] ) . without losing generality ,",
    "we denote the two free coefficients as @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "thus the other four are given as @xmath25 substituting ( [ eq : a2 ] ) back into ( [ eq : dilationser ] ) yields the two - parameter ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) dilation symmetry group : @xmath28 which has a clear explanation , i.e. a mapping of a solution at the location @xmath29 to a series of solutions at locations @xmath30 in the sink flow ( see figure [ fig : sink ] ) .",
    "note that translations for @xmath31 also keep ( [ eq : mmepsi ] ) invariant , which , however , break the invariance of wall conditions @xmath32 and @xmath33 , hence not considered here .",
    "an important fact is that the symmetry group ( [ eq : dilation ] ) implies the necessary boundary conditions for the existence of the equilibrium state ( i.e. the similarity solution ) as follows . by integrating the characteristic equations of ( [ eq : dilation ] ) ,",
    "i.e. @xmath34 we obtain five independent dilation invariants : @xmath35 which are explained in order .",
    "the first invariant @xmath36 , in analogy to the similarity variable @xmath37 in the blasius equation , describes the characteristic line of the dilation , i.e. @xmath38 .",
    "taking @xmath39 we have @xmath40 , corresponding to the radial mean streamline in figure [ fig : sink ] @xcite .",
    "the second invariant @xmath41 indicates that the pressure gradient parameter @xmath42 , widely used in literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) , must satisfy @xmath43 where @xmath44 is substituted .",
    "when @xmath39 , we have @xmath45 , which is indeed the pressure gradient condition for the sink flow tbl ( also note that @xmath46 indicating the sink strength @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath47 requires a streamiwse dependent blowing / suction velocity @xmath48 .",
    "again , @xmath39 leads to @xmath49 , which is exactly the blowing / suction setting in the dns by @xcite for the sink flow tbl .",
    "finally , @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively indicate the invariants along the characteristic lines , composed of @xmath52 and @xmath8 ( both are dependent variables ) with @xmath5 . specifically for the sink flow",
    ", @xmath52 keeps invariant under dilation .",
    "note that all of the group parameters are independent of viscosity ( or @xmath2 ) .",
    "such a @xmath2-independent dilation invariance should be considered as a significant property of the sink flow tbl , because the symmetry could be physically identified in the flow field without changing the viscosity ( by different fluids ) , as sketched in figure [ fig : sink ] .",
    "furthermore , the pde system ( [ eq : mass])-([eq : mme ] ) is now transformed to an ode under ( [ eq : dilation ] ) .",
    "before we proceed , it is natural to normalize above invariants to be dimensionless using @xmath53 ( viscosity ) and @xmath41 ( sink strength ) @xcite , which are : @xmath54 ( negative @xmath41 due to @xmath55 in figure [ fig : sink ] ) . substituting ( [ eq : i ] ) and ( [ eq : invaraint ] ) into ( [ eq : mmepsi ] )",
    "we obtain : @xmath56 which describes a class of the self - preserving flows . here",
    ", @xmath57 represents the dimensionless blowing / suction velocity . for @xmath58 ( zpg ) , @xmath59 ( laminar flow ) and @xmath60 ( non - penetrating wall ) , ( [ eq : f ] ) is the blasius equation for laminar boundary layers . for nonzero @xmath27 with @xmath61 , ( [ eq : f ] ) is the falkner - skan family of boundary layers , with an exact analytical solution for @xmath39 ( i.e. @xmath62 - 2 $ ] ) @xcite . for @xmath63 and @xmath61 , ( [ eq : f ] ) is the similarity equation obtained in @xcite for stagnation point flows ( equation 2.2 with @xmath64 indicating the steady flow condition ) . moreover , for @xmath39 with nonzero @xmath65 and @xmath57 , ( [ eq : mmepsi ] ) becomes : @xmath66 which is the self - preserving form of the sink flow tbl with blowing / sucntion effects . note that ( [ eq : stblbs ] ) has been obtained by @xcite ( for @xmath60 ) and @xcite ( for @xmath67 ) by dimensional analysis ( assuming a specific self - similarity ) .",
    "however , the symmetry analysis here is more straightforward ( the advantage as emphasized in @xcite ) resulting from the nsbl equation , and ( [ eq : f ] ) is more general than ( [ eq : stblbs ] ) which indicates that there may exist other equilibrium flows with different values of @xmath27 and @xmath57 ( an open issue for future study ) .",
    "several interesting results can be deduced for @xmath39 .",
    "first , it is derived from the definition that the wall friction velocity @xmath68 scales the same as the free stream velocity , i.e. @xmath69 ( since @xmath70 is a constant ) .",
    "then , the similarity variable @xmath71 ( dimensionless invariant ) in ( [ eq : stblbs ] ) actually scales the same as the viscous unit , i.e. @xmath72 , and ( [ eq : stblbs ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath73 where superscript @xmath74 denotes viscous normalization , i.e. @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( all normalized variables are positive ) .",
    "a validation of ( [ eq : mmeutau ] ) is shown in figure [ fig : uv ] , in good agreement with our theoretical descriptions ( explained later ) .",
    "note that superficially ( [ eq : mmeutau ] ) shows no explicit @xmath2 dependence , but in fact the latter is contained in the pressure gradient parameter @xmath80 . in dns data of @xcite",
    ", @xmath81 is fixed while the dimensionless blowing / suction strength @xmath82 ( invariant along the stream ) varies within a typical range from @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "this thus allows us to focus on the wall blowing / suction effects here , leaving the @xmath80 effect for future study ( we hence omit the @xmath80 dependence below ) .",
    "moreover , an exact relation between @xmath85 and @xmath86 following the streamfunction ( [ eq : psia ] ) is obtained : @xmath87 here @xmath88 and @xmath89 are substituted ( note also @xmath90 ) . the comparison with dns data @xcite",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : uv ] .",
    "note that the remarkable linear slope extends from wall to the entire flow region .",
    "the data agrees with the theoretical @xmath91 in ( [ eq : uv ] ) closely thus validating the above analysis .",
    "we pursue the intriguing question , i.e. how the wall blowing / suction influences the mean velocity . to address this ,",
    "let us recall a similar problem in compressible flows where the mean velocity is altered by the density variation . through the well - known van driest transformation ,",
    "different mean velocities at different @xmath92 s are transformed into a universal profile at @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "similarly , it is natural to make an analogy that mean velocities at different @xmath94 would be transformed to be the universal one at @xmath60 - when wall blowing / suction effects are considered in a proper way .",
    "this is formally expressed as : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the mean velocity at @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath97 ; @xmath98 is the weighting function , and @xmath99 is the mean shear obtained from mean velocity profiles @xmath100 for blowing / suction conditions . note that @xmath101 is a function of mean density in the van driest transformation ; here @xmath101 is unknown a priori , whose determination ( as below ) thus achieves a quantitative characterization of the intriguing blowing / suction effects . to emphasize , the existence of such a @xmath101 in ( [ eq : transa ] )",
    "is nontrivial , because it requires that the wall blowing / suction not only preserves the streamwise equilibrium condition , but also leads to a new similarity among different @xmath57 s - never addressed before .",
    "in fact , ( [ eq : transa ] ) has a transparent physical meaning . to see this ,",
    "let us differentiate ( [ eq : transa ] ) with @xmath102 and obtain @xmath103 .",
    "the latter indicates that @xmath104 is the relative variation of the mean shear @xmath105 divided by @xmath106 at the non - penetrating wall .",
    "this is very much like the case in the rough pipes @xcite , where the mean flux in rough pipes subtracted by the smooth wall flux ( the so called hamas function ) is the right quantity to reveal the similarity induced by roughness elements .",
    "this also inspires us to seek the expression of the @xmath101 function .    note",
    "that the transformation ( [ eq : transa ] ) implies a @xmath57-independent quantity @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "it motivates us to study the generalized symmetry of ( [ eq : mmeutau ] ) where group invariants independent of @xmath57 can be calculated from first principle . to extend the symmetries of ( [ eq : mmeutau ] ) , we take the derivative of ( [ eq : mmeutau ] ) with respect to @xmath102 to obtain the pde system @xmath109 here",
    ", @xmath80 is a constant ( pressure gradient ) ; @xmath110 depends on @xmath57 ; and @xmath111 and @xmath112 depend on @xmath57 and @xmath102 .",
    "then , using maple , the infinitesimals for the symmetry transformation of ( [ eq : pde ] ) are calculated : @xmath113 where @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) are arbitrary functions of @xmath57 and @xmath110 .",
    "the corresponding characteristic equations for group invariants are : @xmath116 since our goal is a @xmath57-independent @xmath107 , we focus on the invariant composed of @xmath57 and @xmath117 by integrating the first equation in ( [ eq : cr ] ) , i.e. @xmath118 therefore , @xmath119 and any functions of @xmath119 are also group invariants independent of @xmath57 . while this gives a general expression of a @xmath57-independent quantity , we need to further identify the explicit expression of @xmath107 . as shown later below",
    ", @xmath107 is indeed a function of @xmath119 and hence also a group invariant in most of the flow region ( where @xmath120 or @xmath121 ) .",
    "this is important because it supports that @xmath122 is indeed a @xmath57-independent quantity based on the first principle ( i.e. the symmetry of ( [ eq : pde ] ) ) .",
    "below we start to derive an analytical @xmath101 once the mean velocity profile @xmath123 is known . at first , integrating ( [ eq : mmeutau ] ) from @xmath124 to @xmath102 yields , @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the sum of the shear stress ( rs ) , the pressure gradient effect ( pg ) and the mean vertical convection ( vc ) , i.e. @xmath127 by dimensional analysis , a characteristic length function is introduced inspired by the order function concept in @xcite : @xmath128 therefore @xmath129 where @xmath130 .",
    "then , ( [ eq : ratio ] ) leads to an important expression for @xmath101 in terms of @xmath117 and @xmath131 , i.e. @xmath132\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "now , the key is to estimate @xmath131 as below . considering that the moderate blowing / suction effect is indicated by a small parameter @xmath135 ( validated by all the data here ) , an expansion of @xmath136 in @xmath57 is thus : @xmath137 where coefficients @xmath138 and @xmath139|_{\\gamma=0}$ ] are generally functions of @xmath102 .",
    "for simplicity , the expansions are truncated at the first order , i.e. @xmath140 , which , after a substitution into ( [ eq : phia ] ) , yields @xmath141\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and hence @xmath142.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the relation between ( [ eq : snew ] ) and the symmetries of ( [ eq : pde ] ) is further discussed here .",
    "note that for @xmath143 or @xmath120 ( data showing @xmath144 beyond the buffer layer thickness @xmath145 ) , ( [ eq : snew ] ) approximates to @xmath146.\\ ] ] importantly , @xmath107 in ( [ eq : s12 ] ) is indeed a function of the group invariant @xmath147 , i.e. @xmath148={{2 } }",
    "/[{1 +   \\sqrt { 1 + 4 /(e^ { i_s})^2}}].\\ ] ] here , after substituting the following specific conditions in ( [ eq : is2 ] ) , i.e. @xmath149 the invariant @xmath150 is given as : @xmath151 therefore , ( [ eq : isnew ] ) tells us that @xmath107 in ( [ eq : s12 ] ) is also a group invariant hence independent of @xmath57 and equals @xmath152 .",
    "note that equations ( [ eq : gs ] ) with ( [ eq : f5f2 ] ) are called generalized symmetries , because they are permitted by ( [ eq : pde ] ) , but not by ( [ eq : mmeutau ] ) due to the cubic term @xmath153 in the latter .",
    "furthermore , the above analysis also applies to @xmath154 ( viscous sublayer ) , where ( [ eq : snew ] ) approximates to @xmath155 .",
    "the latter is of course a group invariant with @xmath156 in ( [ eq : gs ] ) ; this result trivially follows from the linear expansion @xmath157 at the wall ( see figures [ fig : trans]a & b ) .    the value of @xmath158 is measured as below .",
    "note that from ( [ eq : phib ] ) , @xmath159 for @xmath160 , indicating @xmath161 for @xmath162",
    ". therefore , we use dns to measure the value of @xmath158 by plotting @xmath163 ( see figure [ fig : trans]c ) , which is suggested as @xmath164 here the negative sign indicates that @xmath165 decreases with increasing @xmath57 , which is physical .",
    "this is because a larger @xmath57 indicates more mean vertical convection to be compensated by pressure force in ( [ what ] ) , hence a relatively smaller @xmath166 and a smaller @xmath165 .",
    "also note that the value @xmath167 is empirical whose @xmath80 dependence is an interesting topic for future study .",
    "therefore , we obtain the final transformation by substituting ( [ eq : phib ] ) with ( [ eq : eta ] ) into ( [ eq : transa ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : trans]a shows notable departures of @xmath85 profiles from each other before the transformation , and the departures increase apparently with increasing wall distance .",
    "in contrast , figure [ fig : trans]b shows the transformed velocities ( @xmath168 ) according to ( [ eq : transa ] ) , which remarkably collapse onto the universal one @xmath169 for the entire flow region .",
    "to display the quality of the collapse , figure [ fig : trans]d compares @xmath170 ( opens ) with @xmath171 ( solids ) . while the maximum difference among two velocity profiles before transformation is between @xmath172 and @xmath173 , i.e. @xmath174 ; differences after transformation are mostly bounded within 0.4 .",
    "we further plot @xmath175 in figure [ fig : trans]e , which are all bounded within 2% after transformation .",
    "this is satisfactory since we only use a the linear expansion for @xmath131 ( i.e. a constant @xmath158 ) .    the performance of the transformation ( [ eq : transa ] )",
    "is further illustrated by a reverse transformation from @xmath169 to @xmath85 . in order words , we predict @xmath85 s at different @xmath94 from the single profile @xmath176 .",
    "note that according to ( [ eq : phia ] ) and ( [ eq : phib ] ) , we have @xmath177\\approx{{2 } } / [ { 1 +   \\sqrt { 1 + 4{}\\xi^ * ( \\xi^ *   - 1){(1 + \\eta\\gamma ) } ^2 } } ] \\ ] ] where @xmath178 ( and @xmath179 ) .",
    "thus , by integrating ( [ eq : phic ] ) with @xmath102 , the resulted mean velocity is : @xmath180 the results are shown in the figure [ fig : ut ] .",
    "one can see the agreement is very good and the relative errors are within 2% for the entire flow region .",
    "note that one may introduce a damping function @xcite to model @xmath165 and hence obtaining @xmath85 .",
    "this is another topic to be presented elsewhere .",
    "moreover , the wall normal mean velocity and reynolds shear stress are given based on the single @xmath181 profile .",
    "according to ( [ eq : uv ] ) we have @xmath182 which indicates the wall normal velocity monotonically decreases from wall due to the sink flow constraint .",
    "in addition , the reynolds shear stress from ( [ eq : mmeutau ] ) is : @xmath183 above results are shown in the figure [ fig : v ] , both @xmath184 and @xmath185 agreeing well with data .",
    "note that towards freestream @xmath186 deviates modestly from data as it is very sensitive to the value of @xmath80 ; however , the agreement is remarkable on the whole .",
    "note that from ( [ eq : vtrans ] ) and ( [ eq : wtrans ] ) , the budget terms of ( [ eq : mmeutau ] ) are calculated in figure [ fig : uv]a , in good agreement with data .",
    "therefore , from @xmath169 we obtain a complete description of all the quantities in the equations ( [ eq : mass]-[eq : mme ] ) . the results in turn support well the similarity transformation ( [ eq : transa ] ) .",
    "we present a first similarity transformation for the mean velocities in sink flow tbl with blowing and suction effects .",
    "it achieves a mapping of different @xmath85 s at different blowing / suction strength @xmath57 s into a universal @xmath169 at @xmath60 .",
    "the result builds on a lie group symmetry analysis which derives the self - similarity equation ( ode ) for the mean mass and momentum , and unifies the falkner - skan equation and the sink flow tbl with different pressure gradient and blowing / suction effects . unlike dimensional analysis where there are various ways to combine primary variables , the dilation symmetry here straightforwardly leads to the similarity variables .",
    "the latter has been emphasized by @xcite as an advantage of symmetry analysis and has been suggested to be used along with dimensional analysis .    in the second part of this paper , a characteristic length",
    "is introduced whose first order expansion in @xmath57 leads to an analytical expression of the transformation .",
    "the latter is further shown to be a group invariant in the flow region where @xmath121 or @xmath120 under a generalized symmetry analysis .",
    "note that the expansion is key to the success of the transformation , which means that blowing / suction conditions can be effectively described by the relative variation ( ratio ) of length functions .",
    "such a procedure ( by characteristic lengths ) has been introduced by @xcite as a new way to quantify turbulent wall flows ( with more results to be presented ) .",
    "note that all of the mean flow quantities ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath112 ) are calculated from the single profile @xmath176 with high accuracy .",
    "the results indicate that the wall blowing / suction not only preserves the equilibrium condition but also leads to a new similarity among different @xmath57 s .",
    "a further discussion on the meaning of the dilation symmetry is presented here .",
    "note that ( [ eq : dilation ] ) means that if @xmath187 is a solution of the sink flow tbl , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 is also a solution .",
    "in other words , ( [ eq : dilation ] ) implies a similarity solution of the form @xmath191 for the sink flow tbl , just like the blasius similarity solution @xmath192 for the flat plate laminar boundary layer . as the former can be rewritten as @xmath193 since @xmath194 and @xmath195 , ( [ eq : dilation ] ) also indicates that the mean velocity profiles at different streamwise locations would collapse when nondimensionalized by @xmath196 and @xmath102 ( applies also to the reynolds shear stress profiles ) , which is actually confirmed by the dns data .",
    "however , to emphasize , ( [ eq : dilation ] ) does not result in any specific form of @xmath85 ( nor of @xmath112 ) .",
    "the latter of course allows the scaling such as the log law in the overlap region or the exponential law in the wake region as proposed by @xcite ; nevertheless , these scalings are just ` candidate ' invariant solutions but not a direct consequence of the symmetry analysis .",
    "this is the difference between our current work and oberlack s ( 2001 ) .",
    "this work also opens several important issues which are explained briefly .",
    "the first is on the @xmath80 effect .",
    "while the current study focuses on a specific @xmath80 , more calculations are needed for different @xmath80 s to validate the transformation with an appropriate @xmath158 .",
    "secondly , towards a compete analytical description of mean velocity profiles ( for instance the @xmath176 ) , closure assumptions such as the mixing length model or the asymptotic logarithmic law can be introduced . along this direction ,",
    "a third - parameter paradigm , i.e. @xmath197 is expected in analogy to @xcite .",
    "thirdly , it is important to delineate the @xmath57 range where the similarity transformation holds , as a huge intensive blowing / suction effect would break the similarity transformation and the equilibrium flow state .",
    "this is already mentioned in the preceding expansion analysis where @xmath135 is noted .",
    "finally , a similar analysis can be carried out for the sink flow tbl with different roughness effects @xcite .",
    "note that extending the current work to source flows would be interesting to determine if the rich variety of similarity flow states @xcite would be broken by blowing / suction .",
    "all these to be pursued in future are essential to the fundamental understanding of turbulent wall flows .",
