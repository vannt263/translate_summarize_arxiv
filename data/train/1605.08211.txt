    "solitons are solutions of non - linear wave equations that maintain their shape during time evolution .",
    "they appear in different phenomena investigated in the fields of non - linear optics , ultra - cold atomic gases and in many other physical systems .",
    "both in the optics and atomic gases bright and dark solitons have been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the former corresponds to a localized pulse propagating without a change of shape through an optical self - focusing kerr medium or to a localized matter - wave packet formed by attractively interacting atoms @xcite .",
    "dark solitons are related to dark holes on continuous - wave background that can be created in a self - defocusing kerr medium or in repulsively interacting massive particles @xcite .    in the areas of non - linear optics and ultra - cold atomic gases , the non - linear wave equations are results of the approximation that assumes occupation of single modes by a large number of photons or atoms",
    "these equations provide a very accurate description of the soliton experiments @xcite .",
    "evidently there are observables related to higher order correlations which can not be obtained within a mean - field description @xcite .",
    "they are however very difficult for experimental detection .",
    "rapid development of experimental techniques in the area of ultra - cold gases opens possibility for realization and precise detection of systems with a relatively small particle number .",
    "in such a case , many - body effects that go beyond the mean - field approximation become important and experimentally relevant @xcite .",
    "there are examples of quantum many - body systems where solutions of the schrdinger equation can be obtained analytically . in one - dimensional ( 1d ) space ,",
    "the bethe ansatz approach turns out to be invaluable in description of bosonic or fermionic atoms and various mixtures of atomic species interacting via contact @xmath0-potentials @xcite .",
    "the celebrated lieb - liniger model describes bosonic particles with contact interactions in a 1d space @xcite . in the case of periodic boundary conditions , all energy eigenstates of the system",
    "are also eigenstates of the unitary operator that translates all particles by the same distance .",
    "thus , it is not clear which solutions of the many - body schrdinger equation can be identified with the mean - field solitons because the latter break the translational symmetry .",
    "the identification is particularly difficult in the case of repulsive particle interactions where a dark soliton does not correspond to the lowest energy solution of the non - linear mean - field equation .",
    "nearly 40 years ago it was conjectured that eigenstates belonging to the so - called type  ii excitation spectrum of the lieb - liniger model were related to the mean - field dark soliton solutions due to the coincidence of the spectrum with the soliton dispersion relation @xcite .",
    "there are many publications that confirm this conjecture @xcite .",
    "especially it is shown that a proper superposition of the type  ii eigenstates allows one to prepare states where dark soliton signatures are visible in the reduced one - particle density and in the behavior of the matrix element of the bosonic field operator @xcite .",
    "demonstration that a single type  ii eigenstate reveals dark soliton character has been given recently only @xcite .",
    "the single eigenstate possesses the translational symmetry and consequently the corresponding reduced one - particle density is uniform with no soliton signature . however , one - particle density is related to density of atoms averaged over many realizations of the same experiment . for many - body systems ,",
    "already a single experiment allows one to plot a particle density and such a single outcome can be very different from the average result as demonstrated in different many - body problems @xcite .",
    "it turns out that dark solitons can emerge in the course of measurement of particle positions @xcite .",
    "that is , after the measurement of a single particle , the probability density for the measurement of the position of the second particle is not longer uniform because the translational symmetry is broken in the first measurement .",
    "if we continue the particle measurements , the shape of probability density for measurements of consecutive particles approaches the dark soliton profile .",
    "when @xmath1 particles is detected and only the last particle is left its wave - function matches perfectly a soliton solution of the mean - field equation @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have demonstrated the emergence of single and double solitons in the measurement of positions of particles prepared in type ii eigenstates in the weak interaction limit .",
    "we have also analyzed results of the measurement in the case of moderate interactions . here , we focus on dynamics of many - body states that result from translational symmetry breaking of initial symmetric eigenstates and try to answer the question if signatures of the mean - field evolution of dark solitons can be observed .",
    "moreover , we analyze the bose system prepared in type ii eigenstates in the strong interaction regime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ liebliniger ] we describe shortly the lieb - liniger model and present the key elements of the numerical methods that we use . in sec .",

    "the interpretation of the other branch ( type  ii ) was not clear initially . later on it",
    "was found out that the type  ii branch followed the dark soliton dispersion relation in the weak interaction regime @xcite .",

    "[ ba ]    it is convenient to bring here the analogy between the studied interacting bose system and the ideal fermi gas in 1d .",

    "the following discussion and analogies to the fermi gas can not be understood literally .    first note , that the numbers @xmath12 are closely related to the quasi - momenta .",
    "there is one to one correspondence between @xmath11 and @xmath13 , a function relating them is monotonic ( preserves ordering ) , i.e. if @xmath17 then @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , to simplify our discussion we will sometimes identify these two quantities addressing numbers @xmath11 as ` momenta ' .",

    "that is , particles have been measured one by one and at each time the conditional probability for the measurement of a next particle has been calculated @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the conditional probability is possible because matrix elements @xmath34 , so - called form factors of the field operator , can be easily obtained by means of the determinant formulas @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the simulations of the particle measurements can be significantly simplified with the help of monte carlo algorithm of metropolis et al .",
    "@xcite , based on the markovian walk in the configuration space . having @xmath35 , we can employ the metropolis procedure which allows us to obtain a sequence of random sets of particles position @xmath36 from the @xmath2-dimension probability distribution .",
    "this procedure is equivalent to direct sampling of the @xmath2-paricle probability density @xmath37 and also equivalent to the sequential choice of the particle positions applied in ref .",

    "the monte carlo method does not suffer from this problem because the form of the eigenstates ( [ ba ] ) is the same regardless of the value of the interaction strength .    in this work",
    "we want to show that the lieb - liniger type  ii excitations occur to be solitons not only at a given instant of time , while observed , but , what is also very important , they propagate like genuine solitons should do , including double - soliton solutions and their collisions . to this end",

    "<S> the corresponding eigenstates possess translational symmetry which can be broken in measurements of positions of particles . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze emergence of single and double solitons in the course of the measurements and investigate dynamics of the system . in the weak interaction limit , the system follows the mean - field prediction for a short period of time . </S>",
    "<S> long time evolution reveals many - body effects that are related to an increasing uncertainty of soliton positions . in the strong interaction regime particles </S>",
    "<S> behave like impenetrable bosons . </S>",
    "<S> then , the probability densities in the configuration space become identical to the probabilities of non - interacting fermions but the wave - functions themselves remember the original bose statistics . </S>",
    "<S> especially , the phase flips that are key signatures of the solitons in the weak interaction limit , can be observed in the time evolution of the strongly interacting bosons . </S>"
