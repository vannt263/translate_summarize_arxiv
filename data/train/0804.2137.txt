    "in the last few years , researchers have been accumulating evidence that several kinds of real - life complex systems can be described in terms of networks or graphs , where nodes represent typical system units and edges represent interactions between connected pairs of units .",
    "this topological description has been applied to study both natural and man - made systems , and is currenlty employed to describe various types of processes taking place on real systems ( social , biological , economic , technological ) @xcite .",
    "two highlights of these developments were the watts - strogatz small - world model @xcite and the so - called scale - free networks @xcite , which incorporate several basic ingredients of real systems .",
    "in particular ,",
    "watts - strogatz small - world networks are well suited to study properties of systems with underlying topological structure ranging from regular lattices to random graphs @xcite , by changing a single parameter @xcite .",
    "these networks are based on a regular lattice , in which a fraction @xmath3 of the links between nearest - neighbor sites are randomly replaced by new random connections , thus creating long - range `` shortcuts '' and causing an important decrease in the average distance between nodes @xcite .",
    "in small - world networks one finds at the same time a local neighborhood ( as for regular lattices ) and some global properties of random graphs @xcite .",
    "in particular , the `` distance '' between any two elements is small as compared with the system size , and the propagation of information ( or signal , disease , damage , ... ) takes place much faster than in regular lattices @xcite .",
    "this short global length scale affects strongly the behavior of statistical physical problems on small - world networks , such as site and bond percolation @xcite , as well as the ising model @xcite .",
    "social networks form the substrate where several dynamical processes take place .",
    "these networks have the property of being searchable , i.e. people ( nodes ) can direct messages through their acquaintances to reach distant specific targets in only a few steps @xcite .",
    "although some dynamical processes on complex networks have been studied by using stochastic dynamics and random walks @xcite , it is known that real navigation and exploration processes are usually neither purely random nor totally deterministic @xcite . in this context , the generic properties of deterministic navigation @xcite and directed self - avoiding walks @xcite in complex networks have been analyzed in the last years .",
    "self - avoiding walks ( saws ) may be more effective than unrestricted random walks in exploring a network , as they can not return to sites already visited .",
    "this property has been used to define local search strategies in scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the self - avoiding property causes attrition of the paths , since a large fraction of paths generated in a stochastic way have to be abandoned because they overlap themselves .",
    "this can be an important limitation for exploring networks with this kind of walks .",
    "saws have been employed for many years for modeling structural and dynamical properties of macromolecules @xcite , as well as for studying critical phenomena in lattice models @xcite .",
    "they are also useful to characterize complex crystal structures @xcite and networks in general @xcite .",
    "in particular , the asymptotic properties of saws on small - world networks were studied in connection with the so - called _ connective constant _ or long - distance effective connectivity @xcite .",
    "recently , kinetic - growth self - avoiding walks on uncorrelated complex networks were considered , with particular emphasis upon the influence of attrition on the maximum length of the paths @xcite .",
    "it was found that the average length scales as a power of the system size @xmath8 , with an exponent that depends on the characteristics of the considered networks . for regular lattices , however , the average maximum length of kinetic growth saws is finite @xcite , contrary to uncorrelated networks , for which it diverges in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "thus , for small - world networks there will appear a crossover when changing the rewiring probability @xmath3 , from a regime with confined paths ( finite average length typical of regular lattices , @xmath3 = 0 ) to one with diverging length ( characteristic of random networks , @xmath9 ) .    here",
    "we study long - range properties of kinetically - grown walks on small - world networks , and consider the `` attrition problem '' .",
    "the number of surviving walks to a given length @xmath10 is obtained by approximate analytical procedures , and the results are compared with those obtained from numerical simulations .",
    "we find that the average maximum length increases as the rewiring probability @xmath3 is raised , and eventually diverges in the thermodynamic limit for @xmath9 , as expected for random networks .",
    "we note that the term _ length _ is employed throughout this paper to indicate the ( dimensionless ) number of steps of a walk , as usually done in the literature on networks @xcite , and does not correspond to a distance on the underlying regular lattice .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give some definitions and concepts related to saws , along with details on our numerical method . in sec .",
    "iii we analyze the length at which non - reversal random walks intersect themselves on small - world networks ( self - intersection length ) , and in sec .",
    "iv we calculate the average attrition length of kinetic growth saws , at which they can not continue without violating the self - avoidance condition .",
    "the paper closes with the conclusions in sec .",
    "v. in three appendices we give details of the probabilistic calculations .",
    "the networks studied here were generated from a two - dimensional square lattice ( connectivity @xmath11 ) .",
    "small - world networks were built up according to the model of watts and strogatz @xcite .",
    "we consider in turn each of the bonds in the starting lattice and replace it with a given probability @xmath3 by a new bond .",
    "this means that one end of the bond is changed to a new node chosen at random in the whole network .",
    "we impose the conditions : ( i ) no two nodes can have more than one bond connecting them , and ( ii ) no node can be connected by a link to itself .",
    "this method keeps constant the total number of links in the rewired networks , and the average connectivity ( or degree ) is @xmath12 .",
    "the total number of rewired links is @xmath13 on average . in the rewiring process we avoided sites with zero and one links , and",
    "thus each site has at least two neighbors .",
    "note that nodes with @xmath14 behave as culs - de - sac for self - avoiding walks , i.e. , a walk arriving at a node with connectivity @xmath15 can not continue , even though it has not yet intersected itself .    to study the asymptotic behavior of kinetic growth saws as @xmath2 , and analyze the convergence of their properties with system size , we simulated networks of several sizes , including up to @xmath16 sites .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were assumed .    for small - world networks ,",
    "the probability distribution of connectivities , @xmath17 , is short - tailed with an exponential decrease for large @xmath18 .",
    "analytical expressions for this probability distribution have been given elsewhere @xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "we will only give some details necessary for the discussion below . to this end",
    ", we distinguish now between the ends of links that remain on their original sites ( as in the regular lattice ) , and those changed in the rewiring process .",
    "the number of links in a network with mean connectivity @xmath19 amounts to @xmath20 .",
    "since each link connecting two sites in the starting regular lattice is rewired with probability @xmath3 , the average number of changes per site is @xmath21 .",
    "this means that each connection of a site is removed in the rewiring process with probability @xmath22 .",
    "then , the number of links @xmath23 generated in the rewiring process and arriving at a node follows , in the limit of large @xmath8 , a poisson distribution for @xmath24 : @xmath25    we note that other ways of generating small - world networks from regular lattices have appeared in the literature . in particular , newman _",
    "_ @xcite instead of rewiring each bond with probability @xmath3 , added shortcuts between pairs of sites chosen uniformly at random , without removing any bonds from the starting lattice .",
    "this procedure turns out to be more convenient for analytical calculations , but does not keep constant the mean degree @xmath26 , which in this case increases with @xmath3 .",
    "a self - avoiding walk is defined as a walk along the bonds of a given network which can never intersect itself .",
    "the walk is restricted to moving to a nearest - neighbor site during each step , and the self - avoiding condition constrains the walk to occupy only sites which have not been previously visited in the same walk . the simplest procedure to obtain saws consists in generating ordinary random walks and stop when they arrive at a node already visited . in regular lattices , there appears a problem with this sampling algorithm , caused by the rapid attrition for long walks , because the probability of an @xmath10-step walk being self - avoiding decays exponentially for large @xmath10 @xcite . due to this important limitation ,",
    "more complex methods based on monte carlo sampling have been used to generate saws with the correct weight , and to obtain ensemble averages of various quantities @xcite . in general , for networks including nodes with different degrees ( contrary to usual regular lattices ) , sampling by employing simple random walks introduces a bias in the weight of different saws .    for regular lattices",
    ", the number @xmath27 of saws starting from a site has an asymptotic dependence for large @xmath10 @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a critical exponent which depends on the lattice dimension , and @xmath30 is the _ connective constant _ or effective connectivity of the considered lattice @xcite . in general , for a lattice with connectivity @xmath19 , one has @xmath31 .",
    "this parameter @xmath30 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ un ] ) as the limit @xmath32 .",
    "the connective constant depends upon the particular topology of each lattice , and is known with high accuracy for two- and three - dimensional lattices @xcite .",
    "self - avoiding walks on small - world networks have been studied in recent years @xcite . in particular , for networks generated from the square lattice , the connective constant @xmath30 was found to rise from @xmath33 for rewiring probability @xmath34 ( regular lattice ) to @xmath35 for @xmath36 .    to analyze dynamical processes on networks",
    ", it can be more convenient to use kinetically grown saws .",
    "these walks are well - suited to study search or navigation processes on networks , where they are assumed to grow step by step in a temporal sequence .",
    "their asymptotic behavior can give us also information about the long - range properties of complex networks , in particular on the presence of loops .",
    "in conection with this , an interesting property of kinetically grown saws is the number of steps necessary to intersect themselves .",
    "moreover , we are interested in the possibility of avoiding visited nodes and maximize the length of the walks . for these reasons , we will consider in the following two kinds of growing walks .",
    "the first kind will be _ non - reversal _ self - avoiding walks @xcite . in these",
    "walks one randomly chooses the next step among the neighboring nodes , excluding the previous one .",
    "if one chooses a node already visited , then the walk stops ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . these walks will allow us to study the _ self - intersection length _",
    "( see sec .",
    "the second type of walks considered here are _ kinetic growth _",
    "walks @xcite , in which one randomly selects the next step among the unvisited adjacent sites and stops growing when none are available .",
    "these walks have been studied earlier to describe the irreversible growth of linear polymers @xcite , and will allow us to consider the _ attrition length _ for a walk on a given network ( see sec .",
    "we note that kinetic growth walks are less sensitive to attrition than non - reversal saws , since in the former the walker always escapes whenever a way exists .    for each set of parameters ( @xmath3 , @xmath8 ) , we considered different network realizations , and for a given network we selected at random the starting nodes for the saws . for a given parameter set",
    ", the total number of generated saws amounted to @xmath37 for each type of walks .",
    "to study the probability of a walk intersecting itself , we consider non - reversal walks that stop when they reach a node already visited in the same walk . the number of steps of a given walk before intersecting itself will be called _ self - intersection length _ and will be denoted @xmath38 .",
    "let us consider @xmath39 non - reversal walks starting from nodes taken at random , and call @xmath40 the number of walks surviving after @xmath10 steps ( i.e. , those which did not arrive yet at any node visited earlier ) . in regular lattices",
    ", it is known that the ratio @xmath41 decreases with the number of steps @xmath10 as @xmath42 , where @xmath29 is the same exponent as in eq .",

    "hence , the surviving probability basically decays for large @xmath10 as @xmath44 , with @xmath45 for the two - dimensional square lattice @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the results of our simulations for small - world networks . in fig .",
    "2 we show the fraction of remaining walks , @xmath41 , as a function of @xmath10 for networks with several sizes and rewiring probability @xmath46 . the network size increases from left to right , and one clearly observes a finite - size effect on the surviving probability of the walks . for increasing network size ,",
    "the results converge to an exponential decrease of the ratio @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , for the maximum size presented in fig . 2 ( @xmath47 nodes ) , we find @xmath48 , with @xmath49 . for other @xmath3 values ,",
    "one finds similar decays of the number of surviving walks , with the coefficient @xmath50 decreasing as @xmath3 rises .",
    "let us call @xmath51 the conditional probability of a walk stopping at step @xmath52 , assuming that it actually arrived at step @xmath10 .",
    "the exponential decay observed for @xmath41 is compatible with a constant @xmath51 , independent of @xmath10 ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) , as is expected at least for the asymptotic regime at large @xmath10 . in fact , assuming a constant @xmath51 , one has @xmath54 which can be solved by iteration with the initial condition @xmath55 , giving @xmath56 comparing this result with the exponential decay of @xmath41 found above , we can identify : @xmath57 .",

    "4 , as derived from the results of our simulations ( open symbols ) . in the remainder of this section , we present two analytical approximations for @xmath58 , valid for the regions close to @xmath66 and @xmath36 .",

    "4 .    to derive an approximate expression for the mean self - intersection length for finite ( small ) @xmath3 , we consider non - reversal saws on the regular lattice , and calculate the corrections introduced by the rewired links in small - world networks .",

    "for the derivation presented in appendix a , we assume : ( 1 ) the walks include zero or one rewired links , which is compatible with our order-@xmath3 approximation , and ( 2 ) a rewired link takes the walker far away from the starting node , which is valid in average for large system size .    with these assumptions ,",

    "3 , and its value is determined by correlations present in the networks . even though these correlations are small for @xmath3 close to 1 , they still control the long - range behavior of saws .",
    "in fact , in the limit @xmath9 and for large enough @xmath8 , the factor limiting the length of the walks is the residual presence of loops of size four in the networks , remaining from the starting regular lattice .",

    "this includes the assumption that a rewired link takes in general the walker to a node on the lattice far away from the starting one ( which is valid in average for large @xmath8 ) .",
    "we also assume that once a walk has employed a rewired link , it does not find any other , which is consistent with our order-@xmath3 approximation for @xmath58 ( no more than one rewired link in a walk ) .",

    "we then assume that the walks finish after circulating along the links of four - node loops ( see fig .",

    "this probability @xmath139 is given by @xmath140 , where we have used that the mean connectivity is @xmath64 , and that there are two ways to walk around the considered four - node loop ( clockwise and counter - clockwise , see fig .",

    "in this appendix we calculate the probability of arriving at a node with @xmath143 ( labeled as `` 4 '' in fig 5(b ) ) in a four - node loop , after circulating along the links of the loop .",
    "we assume that node `` 4 '' has degree two , so that two of its original links in the regular lattice have been rewired away ( probability @xmath116 for each one ) , and no other connection has been established with this node during the rewiring process ( probability @xmath144 , see eq .",

    "since the average number of links leading to the loop from the outside through nodes `` 1 '' or `` 3 '' is four , the fraction of links in the network leading to this kind of cycles is @xmath147 this includes the assumption that the probability of four - node cycles with more than one node with @xmath102 is negligible ( in fact it is much lower than that of only one node with degree 2 ) .",
