    "it is now generally accepted that the onset and fueling of agn activity is closely related to dissipative tidal interactions and mergers of galaxies , and that there is a close synergy between the formation and growth of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies themselves . for recent reviews and further references ,",
    "see , e.g. , the proceedings edited by @xcite , or the study by @xcite .",
    "if galaxy interactions are responsible for triggering of qso activity , it is reasonable to expect that in some cases this would occur in both components of an interacting galaxy pair , resulting in a binary qso .",
    "starting from the early discoveries of such systems @xcite , there are now many tens , if not hundreds of physical binary qsos known @xcite . their frequency may be up to two orders of magnitude higher than what may be expected from simple extrapolations of galaxy clustering at comoving scales @xmath3 kpc , which can be understood if interactions enhance the probability of qso activity , atop of the normal clustering of their host galaxies @xcite ; but the overall picture is still very complex @xcite . in many cases , there are ambiguities between the binary qso and gravitational lensing interpretations of close qso pairs ; see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite for discussions and references .",
    "one such case is the qso pair b1429008 = j14320106 @xcite , whose brighter component was originally found in the lbqs survey @xcite .",
    "the two brightest qso components are at @xmath1 and are separated by 5.14 arcsec , corresponding to a projected separation of 43 kpc ( proper ) or 132 kpc ( comoving ) ; we use the standard friedmann - lemaitre cosmology with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 throughout .    in this @xmath7",
    "we report on the discovery of a third qso component in this system , and discuss additional evidence against the gravitational lensing hypothesis .",
    "we then conclude that this is most likely the first known case of a physical triple qso , which we denote as qqq  @xmath8 below .",
    "we obtained images of the field in the cousins @xmath9 band , using the lris instrument @xcite at the w.m .",
    "keck observatory s 10-m telescope on 13 april 1994 ut , in good conditions .",
    "eight exposures of 300 s each were obtained , and processed using standard techniques .",
    "a section of the coadded image is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "several faint sources surround the previously known qso pair .",
    "we also obtained @xmath10 band images using the nirc instrument @xcite on 06 april 1994 ut , and again on 15 june 1995 ut ; the total usable exposure time was 3360 s. for the purposes of the present analysis , we coadded these data with the eso vlt @xmath11 band images described by @xcite .",
    "the central portion of the stacked image is shown in fig .",
    "we use the same notation for the fainter sources as in @xcite , except for their source # 5 , which we label as c. the limiting magnitudes ( 1 @xmath12 ) for the stacked @xmath10 band image are 24.80 , 24.05 , and 23.30 mag for the apertures of 1 , 2 , or 4 arcsec diameter , respectively .",
    "long - slit spectra were obtained using the lris instrument on 01 february 1995 , in good conditions .",
    "a single 300 s exposure was obtained for the qso component a , and two 1200 s exposures capturing the components b , c , # 3 , and # 8 , with a slit pa = 69@xmath13 .",
    "we used a 300 lines mm@xmath14 grating , and 1.5 arcsec wide slit , giving a mean dispersion of @xmath15   pixel@xmath14 and spectroscopic resolution of fwhm @xmath16  , with a wavelength coverage from @xmath17 to @xmath18  .",
    "the data were reduced using standard techniques .",
    "the spectra of the components a , b , and c are shown in fig .",
    "3 ; it is evident that c is a qso component at the same redshift as a and b. no redshifts could be obtained for the faint objects ( probably galaxies ) # 3 and # 8 , but they show no indications of agn in their spectra .",
    "the j2000 coordinates of the qso a , taken as a mean of the usno a2 and b1 catalogs , are @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the offsets to the component b are @xmath21 w and @xmath22 n , and to the component c are @xmath23 w and @xmath24 n , taken from @xcite .",
    "they correspond to the projected separations a - b , a - c , and b - c of 5.11 , 4.29 , and 3.62 arcsec respectively , or 43 , 36 , and 30 proper kpc ( appropriate for the gravitationally bound systems ) , or 131 , 110 , and 93 comoving kpc .",
    "@xcite give the magnitudes for the qso a : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 mag , with errors of 0.01 mag .",
    "from the sdss dr4 data server , we get @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 mag . for the magnitude differences between the brightest two components , @xcite give @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 mag , i.e. , modest , but statistically significant differences . @xcite",
    "give @xmath38 mag , and @xcite give @xmath39 and @xmath40 mag .    while the optical flux ratio a / b is @xmath41 , in the x",
    "- rays this flux ratio is significantly smaller , @xmath42 , on the basis of champ measurements @xcite .",
    "we also note that the qso a is detected by first at @xmath43 mjy , but qso b is below their detection limit ; deeper radio observations would be very useful .",
    "similarly , for the magnitude differences between the components a and c @xcite give @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 mag .",
    "qso a is saturated in the keck @xmath9 band images , but measure @xmath48 mag .",
    "assuming @xmath49 mag , we infer @xmath50 mag , or , using the sdss measurement , @xmath51 mag . put another way , the colors of the three components from @xcite are @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ; and @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "we infer , using sdss @xmath58 band and our keck @xmath9 band measurements @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the component c seems to be significantly redder in terms of the optical to ir colors than either a or b. we note that the balmer break is redshifted to be between the optical and ir bands , where the color difference seems to occur , so one possible interpretation of the data is that there is a significant starlight component in the measured ir flux from the component c , which is the faintest agn of the three .",
    "3 also shows the ratios of the three spectra .",
    "the spectra of the components a and b are broadly similar , and we note that @xcite found that the observed spectroscopic differences between components a and b are typical for a random pair of qsos at these redshifts .",
    "however , the component c has a significantly @xmath62 continuum in the observed visible regime , reverse of the trend given by its optical to ir colors .",
    "this essentially eliminates the possibility that it is made dimmer and redder by extinction due to a foreground galaxy .",
    "components b and c have clearly a different shape of the c iv 1549 line from the component a , and possibly in other broad lines as well .",
    "we used the cross - correlation technique as implemented in iraf to measure the restframe velocity shifts between the qso spectra . from the peak of the correlation function , we get @xmath63 km s@xmath14 , consistent with the original measurements by @xcite , and @xmath64 km s@xmath14 ,",
    "i.e. , consistent both with zero , and with the relative velocities typical for the bound or interacting galaxies .",
    "several prominent absorption systems are seen , including lines of the c iv doublet 1548.195 , 1550.770 ; al ii 1670.787 ; fe ii 2367.591 , 2382.765 , 2586.650 , 2600.173 ; and mg ii doublet 2796.352 , 2803.531 . in the qso a , the two strongest absorbers are at @xmath65 and @xmath66 ; in the qso b , at @xmath67 and @xmath68 ; and a strong c iv absorber is seen in the spectrum of the qso c at @xmath69 .",
    "presumably absorbers a1 and b2 , and b1 and c1 are caused by the same intervening galaxies .",
    "some of the faint galaxies numbered in figs .",
    "1 and 2 are probably responsible for these foreground systems , and thus would not be associated with the qsos themselves .",
    "we performed image deconvolutions of the data , using the mcs algorithm @xcite .",
    "the most reliable one , in terms of the independently constrained psf , is using the vlt @xmath70 band data , shown in fig .",
    "4 . qso images a and b are the only ones consistent with being unresolved , and an extended component is possible for the component c. its total magnitude , measured in a 2 arcsec aperture is @xmath71 mag , and the flux is divided roughly equally between the unresolved agn component ( @xmath72 mag ) and a resolved component , presumably a host galaxy ( @xmath73 mag ) .",
    "deconvolution also reveals a significant extended component to the ssw of qso a , suggestive of a tidally distorted host galaxy .",
    "while the differences in broad - band spectral energy distributions of the three qso components could be in principle explained away in the context of gravitational lensing with the usual invocations of variability and time delays , perhaps a more natural explanation is that the three components are physically distinct agn .",
    "@xcite presented the most comprehensive analysis to date for this system , while being unaware of the qso nature of the component c. discovery of this new qso component , its flux ratios relative to the components a and b , the geometry of the system , and the greater depth of the keck+vlt data , provide significant new constraints for the lensing hypothesis , which we address here .",
    "the geometry of the three qso components is not very close to that of known lensed quasars .",
    "there is only one triple qso known to be lensed , mg  2016 + 112 @xcite .",
    "we investigate two possible lensing scenarios that may explain the geometry of qqq  @xmath8 . both involve @xmath74 quasar images , three of them being a",
    ", b and c. the difference between the two scenarios is that in one case ( hereafter l1 ) we assume that object d ( indicated in fig .",
    "2 ) is the fourth quasar image and in the second case ( hereafter l2 ) we assume that quasar a is in fact a narrow separation and highly magnified blend of two quasar images .",
    "there is no object in the vicinity of qqq  @xmath8 , that is not immediately ruled out as an extra lensed image due to its far too unrealistic position relative to a , b , c or on the basis of our keck spectra .    in both cases ,",
    "the lensing galaxy potential is modeled as a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) and an external shear @xmath75 added ( sis+@xmath75 ) .",
    "this type of model fits fairly well the image configuration of most known simple gravitationally lensed qsos .",
    "it offers 1 degree of freedom when fitting a quadruply imaged qso with unknown lensing galaxy position .",
    "quadruple systems have 8 observational constraints ( the 4 positions of the lensed qso images ) while the model has 7 parameters : the total mass of the lens , the position of the source relative to the lens ( 2 parameters ) , the amplitude @xmath75 and pa @xmath76 of the shear and the lensing galaxy position ( 2 parameters ) .",
    "we computed lens models using the gravlens software @xcite .",
    "as the position of the lensing galaxy is completly unknown , we adopt a two - fold strategy .",
    "first , we roughly explore the parameter space by fitting models with fixed @xmath76 and galaxy positions , scanning the 2 arcsec - region around the barycenter of quasars a , b , c. for each galaxy position , a broad range of @xmath76 is explored .    in a second step",
    ", we select the model with the best @xmath77 , as obtained in the first step , we adopt its lens center and shear pa , and we run gravlens , with all the model parameters allowed to vary . for the lensing scenario l1 , we adopt 0.02 arcsec relative astrometric errors . for scenario",
    "l2 , we split image a into two sub - components a1 and a2 , separated by 0.05 arcsec . according to the hst images analyzed by @xcite ,",
    "a is a single point source .",
    "their psf subtraction would have detected any blend wider than 0.05 arcsec . for a1 and a2 , we increase artificially the error bars up to 0.2 arcsec , in order to reflect the poor astrometric constraint on the putative components of the blend .",
    "therefore , gravlens is relatively free to recover the image positions within loose error boxes .",
    "we do not get acceptable fits with either model . in the first scenario , l1 , our best model predicts lensed images typically 0.5 arcsec away from the observed positions as indicated by the large value of the reduced @xmath78 .",
    "in addition , such a model predicts image d to be the brightest , and images b and c to have similar brightness , in a clear contradiction with the observations .",
    "such a quadruple configuration seems therefore very unlikely . in the second scenario , l2 ,",
    "our best model has @xmath79 .",
    "images b and c are fairly well reproduced but the 2 merging images a1-a2 are predicted to lie about 1.2 arcsec away from their observed positions , and we can thus reject this possibility as well .",
    "thus , simple lens models do not provide acceptable fit of the observed lensed image configuration .",
    "better fits to the data require to add a secondary lens , resulting in a model with zero degree of freedom . with a simple sis+@xmath75 model ,",
    "we therefore already reach the limit of the available constraints .",
    "in addition , we estimate the total mass of the lens inside the einstein radius for our best model l2 . it can be expressed as a function of redshift as @xmath80 up to @xmath81 0.8 , and as @xmath82 to @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "the shear direction for this model is @xmath85 and its amplitude is @xmath86 .",
    "in contrast to mg  2016 + 112 , no lensing galaxy is seen in qqq  @xmath8 , down to @xmath87 ( 1@xmath12 limit in a 4 arcsec aperture ) . in mg  2016 + 112 , the lens is at z=1.01 and has @xmath88 mag .",
    "the mass of the putative lens , if placed at an overly optimistic @xmath89 is @xmath90 , in a 4 arcsec aperture , using model l2 .",
    "this corresponds to a velocity dispersion of @xmath91 km / s",
    ". if the lens is at @xmath92 then @xmath93 km / s .",
    "if the lens is at @xmath89 then its absolute magnitude would be @xmath94 from the faber - jackson relation ( @xmath12 from lens model , without conversion from @xmath95 to @xmath96 ) .",
    "if it is at @xmath92 then @xmath97 . even without any correction for evolution ,",
    "this translates to apparent magnitudes of @xmath98 , and @xmath99 mag , respectively .",
    "clearly , presence of such lensing galaxies is strongly excluded by our deep @xmath10 band images , even if they were to be aligned with the brightest qso component ( which would be a very difficult geometry to arrange ) .",
    "to summarize , we are unable to produce any plausible lensing model which would account for the observed geometry and intensity ratios of the qso images , and moreover we have strong upper limits on the existence of necessary lensing galaxies or groups .",
    "moreover , we note that @xcite have placed strong limits to weak lensing distortions in this field , which would be expected if a massive lens was present , regardless of its obscuration .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this system is highly unlikely to be a case of gravitational lensing .",
    "the observed differences in the spectra and colors of the qso components , and the great difficulty in modeling the system as a gravitational lens , strongly suggest that we are dealing with a case of a physical triple qso .",
    "the projected separations are typical of those seen in galaxy interactions .",
    "measurements of a qso 3-point correlation function at such physical separations are currently not available , at any redshift .",
    "thus , we can not compute a credible probability for such a configuration in a pure gravitational clustering regime .",
    "however , we know that binary qsos at high redshifts are highly overabundant relative to the predictions derived from simple galaxy and mass clustering models @xcite .",
    "this excess is naturally understood as a consequence of enhanced propensity for fueling of agn in dissipative galaxy interactions .",
    "it is then perhaps not surprising that a triple qso system can be found in similar circumstances .",
    "indeed , we observe qqq  @xmath8 at a redshift where the merging activity ( and the comoving density of qsos ) was roughly at its peak .",
    "several components of the system can then be interpreted as a compact galaxy group caught in process of interacting , with agn activity ignited simultaneously in 3 of the participating host galaxies .",
    "hierarchical merging in such systems could also lead to formation of triple smbh systems , and a number of interesting effects ; see , e.g. , @xcite for a discussion and references .    as the census of such triple - qso systems ( and binary qsos themselves )",
    "grows with the future observations , and the selection effects are better understood , we will have a new observational probe of the processes of galaxy - smbh co - evolution at high redshifts .",
    "we are grateful to the staff of the w. m. keck and eso - vlt observatories for their expert assistance in the course of our observing runs , and to m. pahre with assistance with some of the keck observations .",
