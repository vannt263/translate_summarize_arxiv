    "the presence of a rigidly rotating magnetosphere in the early b - type stars hd23478 and hd345439 was recently discovered in the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment ( apogee ; @xcite ) using high - resolution ( @xmath1 ) near - infrared h - band spectra .",
    "the authors detected in the apogee bandpass prominent brackett series emission lines with a characteristic double - horned profile .",
    "the type of profile and peak separation is typical for the rigidly rotating magnetosphere ( rrm , @xcite ) feature previously discovered in the fast rotating helium - strong star @xmath0orie , which possesses an extremely large magnetic field ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such stars are extremely rare : the discovery of hd23478 and hd345439 has enhanced the number of `` extreme '' rotators by 50% @xcite .",
    "the authors reported that the optical spectra of hd345439 reveal strong hei lines and very fast rotation of @xmath2kms@xmath3 subsequently , @xcite analysed multi - epoch photometric observations of this star from the kilodegree extremely little telescope , wide angle search for planets , and asas surveys revealing the presence of a @xmath40.7701day rotation period in each data set .",
    "the authors suggest that the he - strong star hd345439 of spectral type b2v is among the faster known he - strong @xmath0orie analogs , hr7355 ( @xmath5  @xcite ) and hr5907 ( @xmath6  @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite carried out a spectropolarimetric follow - up of hd345439 on one occasion , obtaining eight subexposures over 88minutes in 2014 june with the focal reducer low dispersion spectrograph ( fors2 ; @xcite ) mounted on the 8 m antu telescope of the vlt .",

    "the fors2 multi - mode instrument is equipped with polarisation analysing optics comprising super - achromatic half - wave and quarter - wave phase retarder plates , and a wollaston prism with a beam divergence of 22@xmath9 in standard resolution mode .",
    "we used the grism 600b and the narrowest available slit width of 0@xmath104 to obtain a spectral resolving power of @xmath11 .",
    "the observed spectral range from 3250 to 6215 includes all balmer lines , apart from h@xmath12 , and numerous helium lines .",
    "for the observations , we used a non - standard readout mode with low gain ( 200khz,1@xmath131,low ) , which provides a broader dynamic range , hence allowed us to reach a higher signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) in the individual spectra .",
    "the exposure time for each subexposure accounted for 7.8min .",
    "a first description of the assessment of longitudinal magnetic field measurements using fors1/2 spectropolarimetric observations was presented in our previous work ( e.g.  @xcite , and references therein ) . to minimize the cross - talk effect , and to cancel errors from different transmission properties of the two polarised beams ,",

    "the longitudinal magnetic field was measured in two ways : using the entire spectrum including all available lines , excluding lines in emission , or using exclusively hydrogen lines .",
    "furthermore , we have carried out monte carlo bootstrapping tests .",
    "these are most often applied with the purpose of deriving robust estimates of standard errors .",
    "the measurement uncertainties obtained before and after the monte carlo bootstrapping tests were found to be in close agreement , indicating the absence of reduction flaws .    since the presence of @xmath33  cep - like pulsations",
    "is frequently found in early b - type stars , we also checked the stability of the spectral lines along full sequences of sub - exposures .",
    "we have compared the profiles of several spectral lines recorded in the parallel beam with the retarder waveplate at @xmath17 .",

    "[ fig : period ] .",
    "since the results of the measurements using the whole spectrum or exclusively the hydrogen lines are rather similar , the frequency analysis was performed using both , the measurements on the entire spectrum and on the hydrogen lines . to detect the most probable period , we calculated the frequency spectrum and for each trial frequency we performed a statistical f - test of the null hypothesis for the absence of periodicity @xcite .",
    "the resulting f - statistics can be thought of as the total sum including covariances of the ratio of harmonic amplitudes to their standard deviations , i.e.  a signal - to - noise ratio .",

    "the observed sinusoidal modulation indicates that the magnetic field structure exhibits two poles and a symmetry axis , tilted with respect to the rotation axis .",

    "[ sect : var ] , the largest dispersion in the hydrogen equivalent width measurements appears around the same phase range and is most likely due to an occultation by circumstellar gas clouds magnetically confined to the magnetic equatorial plane ( e.g.  @xcite ) . using the estimate of the stellar radius @xmath46 for a b2v type star @xcite , @xmath47kms@xmath3 @xcite , and the rotation period @xmath48d",

    "given the high inclination angle @xmath50 and the low inferred obliquity angle @xmath58 , both with rather large errors , the estimation of the dipole strength is rather uncertain , leading to @xmath61 kg .",
    "@xcite studied the variability of several hei lines , the h@xmath12 line and two brackett hydrogen lines in the near - infrared ( nir ) .",
    "although their optical and nir spectroscopy did not cover the full rotation cycle , the temporary changes in line profiles showed a clear correlation with the rotational phase .",

    "significant emission in the wings of the hydrogen lines , best visible in the differential dynamic plot of h@xmath33 , appears at the rotational phase around zero , which corresponds to the maximum of the positive magnetic field strength .",
    "notably , we observe in the h@xmath33 emission wings a slight asymmetry , i.e.  the blue - shifted emission is somewhat stronger and more extended than the redshifted emission .",
    "this behaviour of the h@xmath33 line differs from the behaviour of the h@xmath12 , br@xmath64 , and br@xmath62 lines presented by @xcite in the phase range 0.860.18 , indicating a decrease of the blue - shifted emission with increasing wavelength .",

    "[ fig : ew_hydr ] , we present the variability of the equivalent widths ( ews ) of hydrogen absorption lines showing a minimum at rotational phase 0.1 - 0.2 , which is slightly offset from the positive magnetic pole , and a secondary less pronounced minimum close to the negative magnetic pole .",
    "the presence of intensity minima at these phases is likely related to the stronger hydrogen line profile fill - in by the emission presumably originating in the corrotating magnetospheric clouds ( e.g.  @xcite ) . as already mentioned in sect .",

    "4553 are blue - shifted .",
    "the offsets to the blue and to the red are indicative of the presence of surface he and si spots similar to the finding of he and si spots on the surface of @xmath0orie @xcite .",
    "the results of the analysis of the variability of ews of he and si lines support the presumption of the presence of an inhomogeneous he and si distribution . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ew_he ] , the si line strength increases in the phase range from 0.5 to 0.7 , while the intensity of the he lines decreases in the same phase range . for both elements we do not detect any clear correlation with the location of the magnetic poles .",

    "our spectropolarimetric monitoring using fors2 at the vlt of the rigidly rotating magnetosphere star hd345439 revealed the presence of a strong magnetic field with a minimum polar strength of 9 kg reversing over the very short rotation period of 0.77018d .",

    ", hd23478 , and hr5907 , show low obliquities of their magnetic axes . for these stars it is expected that the plasma clouds are located close to the equatorial plane ( e.g. @xcite ) . due to the presence of strong kg magnetic fields and fast rotation , such stars can serve as excellent laboratories to study the magnetic field and element abundance distributions using zeeman doppler imaging , as well as the effect of the magnetic field configuration on the angular momentum loss and the associated spin - down .",
    "the study of the variability of the he and si lines showed the presence of significant chemical abundance variations across the stellar photosphere .",
    "however , no clear correlation with the position of the magnetic poles is indicated in our data .",
    "future high - resolution high signal - to - noise spectropolarimetric observations will be worthwhile to determine the locations of these abundance spots as well as the surface distribution of other elements .",
