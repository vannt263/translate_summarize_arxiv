    "orbital resonances exist everywhere in the solar system , and play an essential role in the dynamics of small bodies .",
    "the synergy of fast and slow orbital angles produces a great assortment of resonant phenomena @xcite . over the years",
    "numerous methods and models have been developed to interpret the complex dynamical environment of the main asteroid belt .",
    "it is well known that this region is sculpted by a web of mean - motion and secular resonances coupled with subtle non - gravitational forces @xcite .",
    "the implications of these effects on a large number of examples with unique dynamical characteristics have already been successfully described by existing dynamical models .",
    "it is , however , still not possible to explain or predict all the dynamics of the main asteroid belt .",
    "there are two general types of orbital resonances in the solar system .",
    "the most intuitive type , referred to as mean - motion resonances , occurs when the orbital periods of an asteroid and of a perturber are nearly commensurate .",
    "the second type , called secular resonance , concerns slowly varying angles like the longitude of perihelion or the longitude of the ascending node .    secular resonances may play a significant role in the long - term dynamical stability of a planetary system @xcite , however until now studies related to the dynamics of small solar system objects considered only planets as important perturbers .",
    "the role of the most massive asteroids in the asteroid dynamics is generally assumed to be small , and in most cases it is neglected .",
    "still , it is known that perturbations arising from the most massive asteroids could be important in some situations .",
    "being located relatively close to each other , the most important interaction between the most massive and the rest of the asteroids intuitively occurs during their mutual close encounters .",
    "the long - term effects of these encounters have been studied by many authors , typically aiming to explain the evolution of asteroid families @xcite . moreover ,",
    "it was demonstrated by @xcite that there are populations of asteroids in the 1/1 mean motion resonances with the two most massive objects in the main belt , namely ( 1 )  ceres and ( 4 )  vesta .",
    "nevertheless , the importance of massive asteroids for secular dynamics and long - term chaotic diffusion is generally accepted to be negligible ; thus , it has never been studied . in this paper , we show that this paradigm not only lacks justification , but it is actually incorrect .",
    "the results obtained here reveal that a nodal secular resonance with ( 1 )  ceres , namely @xmath0 , plays a key role in the dynamics of asteroids belonging to the hoffmeister family .",
    "the motivation for our work comes from the unusual shape of the hoffmeister asteroid family @xcite when projected on the proper orbital semi - major axis @xmath1 versus sine of proper orbital inclination @xmath2 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the distribution of family members as seen in this plane clearly suggests different dynamical evolution for the two parts of the family delimited in terms of semi - major axis . the part located at @xmath3  au",
    "is dispersed , and seems to undergo significant evolution in inclination , contrary to that at @xmath4  au , which looks much more condensed and practically shows no similar evolution . our goal here is to reveal the mechanism responsible for the observed asymmetry .    * place figure 1 here .",
    "*    analyzing the region around the hoffmeister family we found a few potentially important dynamical mechanisms . the family is delimited in terms of semi - major axis by two mean motion resonances , the 3j-1s-1 three body resonance with jupiter and saturn at 2.752  au , and the 5/2j mean - motion resonance with jupiter at 2.82  au .",
    "moreover , the region is crossed by the @xmath5 secular resonance , with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the secular frequencies of the asteroid s and saturn s orbits .        to identify which ones ,",
    "if any , among the different possible dynamical mechanisms are actually at work here , we performed a set of numerical integrations .",
    "for this purpose we employed the _",
    "orbit9 _ integrator embedded in the multipurpose _ orbfit _ package .",
    "the dynamical model includes the gravitational effects of the sun and the four outer planets , from jupiter to neptune .",
    "it also accounts for the yarkovsky thermal effect , a subtle non - gravitational force due to the recoil force of anisotropically emitted thermal radiation by a rotating body @xcite , causing mainly a secular drift in semi - major axis .",
    "the indirect effect of the inner planets is accounted for by applying a barycentric correction to the initial conditions .",
    "our simulations follow the long - term orbital evolution of test particles initially distributed randomly inside an ellipse determined by the gauss equations .",
    "this ellipse corresponds to the dispersion of the hoffmeister family members immediately after the breakup event , assuming an isotropic ejection of the fragments from the parent body .",
    "the total number of particles used is 1678 , the same as the number of asteroids we currently identified as members of the family .",
    "the family membership is determined utilizing the hierarchical clustering method and standard metric as proposed by @xcite .    for simplicity , the yarkovsky effect is approximated in terms of a pure along - track acceleration , inducing on average the same semi - major axis drift speed @xmath10 as predicted from theory .",
    "assuming an isotropic distribution of spin axes in space , to each particle we randomly assign a value from the interval @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the estimated maximum of the semi - major axis drift speed due to the yarkovsky force .",
    "the value of @xmath12 is determined using a model of the yarkovsky effect developed by @xcite , and assuming thermal parameters appropriate for regolith - covered @xmath13-type objects .",
    "in particular , we adopt values of @xmath14 = @xmath15 = 1300  @xmath16 for the surface and bulk densities @xcite , @xmath17 = 250  @xmath18 for the surface thermal inertia @xcite , and @xmath19 = 0.95 for the thermal emissivity parameter . in this way we found that for a body of @xmath20  km in diameter @xmath12 is about @xmath21  au / myr .",
    "next , we select sizes of the test particles equal to sizes of the hoffmeister family members , estimated using their absolute magnitudes provided by astdys database , and geometric albedo of @xmath22 = 0.047 @xcite . finally , since yarkovsky effect scales as @xmath23 , the particle sizes are then used to calculate corresponding value of @xmath12 for each particle , by scaling from the reference value for objects of @xmath20  km .",
    "the orbits of the test particles are propagated for 300  myr , which is a rough estimate of the age of the hoffmeister family @xcite .",
    "time series of mean orbital elements are produced using on - line digital filtering @xcite .",
    "then , for each particle we compute the synthetic proper elements @xcite for consecutive intervals of 10  myr .",
    "this allows us to study the evolution of the family in the space of proper orbital elements .",
    "if our first dynamical model were complete we should be able to reproduce the current shape of the family .",
    "however , we found that the shape can not be reproduced with the afore described model .",
    "in particular , in these simulations we observed only a dispersion of the semi - major axis caused by the yarkovsky effect , but no evolution in inclination ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this implies that neither mean - motion nor secular resonances involving the major outer planets are responsible for the strange shape of the hoffmeister family .",
    "* place figure 2 here . *    in order to clarify the situation we turned our attention to the inner planets , and their possible role in the evolution of the family . for a representative sample of about 200 test particles we repeated the above described simulations using a model with seven planets ( from venus to neptune ) , which also includes the yarkovsky thermal force .",
    "however , the 7-planet model did not give any different results , which remain practically the same as the one obtained within the model with the four outer planets only .",
    "thus , obviously there is still something missing in the dynamical model .      being left with almost no other option , we turn our attention to asteroid ( 1 )  ceres . having a proper orbital semi - major axis of 2.767  au , and therefore being inside the range covered by the family members",
    ", it seems to be the only remaining candidate .",
    "hence , we again numerically integrated the same test particles , using the 4-planet dynamical model but this time also including ceres as a perturbing body , as estimated by @xcite . ] .    these new simulations already after about 150  myr very nearly matched the current spreading of the family in the semi - major axis versus inclination plane , clearly implicating ceres as the culprit for what we see today .",
    "the striking feature observed in these runs is a fast dispersion of orbital inclinations for objects with semi - major axis of about 2.78  au .",
    "after 15  myr of evolution the spread in sine of inclination is 3 times larger than the initial one , as can be seen in the middle panel in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the fact that the main perturber is ceres raises a very important question .",
    "what is the exact mechanism by which ceres is perturbing the members of the hoffmeister family to such a high degree ?",
    "the current paradigm suggests this may be the result of close encounters , or it might be the consequence of the 1/1 mean motion resonance with ceres .",
    "however , our simulations undoubtedly show that none of these two mechanisms could explain the evolution of the family .",
    "actually , we found that most of the evolution is taking place within a narrow range of the semi - major axis .",
    "however , this range does not correspond to the location of the 1/1 resonance with ceres , neither is there any reason for close encounters to affect only objects within this specific range of semi - major axes .",
    "moreover , it is very unlikely that these two effects would primarily affect orbital inclinations . finally , regardless of the mechanism",
    ", such a large perturbation on asteroids caused by ceres has never been observed in the asteroid belt .",
    "this situation motivates us to test some other mechanisms which are at work in this region , despite generally being accepted to be negligible .",
    "these are the secular resonances with asteroid ceres .    analyzing the secular frequencies of the hoffmeister family members we immediately notice that some of these are very close to the nodal frequency of ceres ( @xmath24  arcsec / yr ) .",
    "this is an interesting fact because the secular resonances involving the nodal frequencies are known to affect mainly the orbital inclination .    to better understand the reasons for the dispersion in inclination , and to determine the possible role of the secular resonance with ceres",
    ", we pick a few particles that experienced significant changes in inclination during our numerical simulations , and analyzed their behavior in more detail .",
    "this analysis identified a mechanism responsible for the evolution of orbital inclinations , revealing a completely new role of ceres in asteroid dynamics .",
    "as an illustration , in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the evolution of one test particle .",
    "this particle was initially located at a semi - major axis of 2.788  au , with its yarkovsky induced drift set to be negative , forcing it to move towards the sun .",
    "after about 65  myr this particle enters the region where the fast dispersion in orbital inclination has been observed . during the time spent in this area ,",
    "the particle s inclination has experienced a fast increase , with the average value jumping from about 4.4 to 4.9 degrees .    * place figure 3 here .",
    "*    let us recall here that a resonance occurs when the corresponding critical angle librates . in the case of the @xmath0 secular resonance the critical angle is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the longitude of the ascending node of an asteroid and ceres , respectively .",
    "clearly , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the period of increase in inclination exactly corresponds to the period of libration of the critical angle of the @xmath28 secular resonance .",
    "this correlation is a direct proof that this resonance is responsible for the evolution and observed spread in the orbital inclination for asteroids belonging to the hoffmeister asteroid family . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plotted the location of the @xmath29 resonance .",
    "though our numerical simulations clearly show that passing through the @xmath29 resonance may cause significant changes in orbital inclination , we further investigated the mechanism . a key to understand the observed behavior are the cyclic oscillations in inclination for objects trapped inside this resonance ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) . in the scenario with the yarkovsky effect included in the model , some of the objects are reaching the border of the @xmath29 while steadily drifting in semi - major axis , and",
    "enter it at random value of the inclination cycle . during the time spent inside the resonance their inclination is continuously repeating the cycles .",
    "however , as the semi - major axis is evolving due to the yarkovsky effect , the objects must sooner or later reach the other border of the @xmath29 , and subsequently exit from the resonance . as the exit also happens at a random value of the inclination cycle ,",
    "the values of orbital inclination with which bodies enter the cycle typically differ from those with which they exit .",
    "in this way the @xmath29 resonance changes the inclination of objects that cross it .",
    "certainly , this mechanism would not work without the yarkovsky effect .",
    "interestingly , this process is very similar to the one observed inside another relatively week secular resonance , namely the @xmath30 , which affects members of the koronis asteroid family @xcite .    * place figure 4 here . *    it is also worth mentioning that although passage across the @xmath29 secular resonance could result in a very fast change in orbital inclination , the total changes are limited and could not exceed the maximal variations .",
    "the amplitude of variations in orbital inclination is not the same for all objects , but it is generally similar as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "moreover , we have found that our test particles typically spend 15 - 30  myr inside the @xmath29 , before being moved outside by the yarkovsky effect .",
    "thus , as a libration period is very long ( about 40  myr ) , most of the particles spend less than one librating cycle inside this resonance ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "finally , let us re - examine the role of @xmath31 for the members of the hoffmeister family .",
    "the results presented above clearly indicate that without ceres in the model , the @xmath31 does not affect the family .",
    "still , with ceres included in the dynamical model @xmath31 may only affect a limited number of members .",
    "our analysis has shown that about 5 per cent of family members could reach this resonance after their inclination is pumped - up , at least a bit , by the @xmath29 resonance ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the orbital inclination of these objects is then additionally dispersed by @xmath31 , being the main reason for the slightly different distributions towards high and low inclinations . moreover , although the analysis along this line is beyond the scope of the letter , we noticed that the @xmath31 resonance also slightly affects the orbital eccentricity of family members .    nevertheless , the role of the @xmath31 in the dynamical evolution of the hoffmaister family members is minor compared to the role of the @xmath29 secular resonance .",
    "thus , the evolution of the family is almost completely determined by the combined effect of the @xmath29 resonance and the yarkovsky effect , and would be practically the same even if the @xmath31 is not that close .",
    "this is the first time a compelling evidence for orbital evolution of small bodies caused by a secular resonance with an asteroid has been found .",
    "we prove that the post - impact transformation of the hoffmeister asteroid family is a direct consequence of the nodal secular resonance with ceres .",
    "this result has very important repercussions for our view of how ceres - size bodies affect the dynamics of nearby objects , and opens new possibilities to study such effects in the main asteroid belt and beyond .",
    "examples include the dynamics of specific asteroid populations , the early phases of planetary formation , and extra - solar debris disks .",

    "note the strange shape of the family in this plane , in particular the large dispersion in the sin(@xmath32 ) direction of the part located at semi - major axis less than about 2.78  au ( denoted by a shaded area in this figure ) .    *",
