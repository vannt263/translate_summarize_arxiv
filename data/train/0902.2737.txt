    "today we have a standard model of cosmology , the so - called @xmath5cdm model , providing an excellent fit to all cosmological data .",
    "this model tells us that dark energy ( de ) and cold dark matter ( cdm ) account of @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the present cosmic energy budget , respectively @xcite .",
    "it is then quite embarrassing that we fail to understand the nature of both de and cdm .",
    "furthermore , if de is a smooth cosmological _ fluid _ with an equation of state @xmath8 , our model is troubled by two fundamental questions related to its relative and absolute density , the _ coincidence _ and _ fine tuning _",
    "problems : why did de start to dominate just when structures had time to form ?",
    "why is its density @xmath9120 orders of magnitude smaller than the ( navely ) expected quantum vacuum density ?    one way to circumvent the coincidence problem amounts to introducing a coupling between cdm and dynamical de ( dde ) @xcite .",
    "the energy transfer from cdm then allows de to comprise a significant fraction of the cosmic energy budget over a large part of the cosmic history .",
    "unfortunately , switching on a coupling apparently worsens the fit of cosmological data .",
    "more recently , however , it has been noted that neutrino masses ( @xmath10 ) and a cdm - dde coupling affect cosmological observables in opposite ways @xcite .",
    "however , not only our ignorance about @xmath10 softens the constraints on the coupling , but a much more puzzling effect arises : models with @xmath11 and coupling appear ( slightly ) favored in respect to @xmath12 uncoupled models .",
    "neutrinos are abundant in the universe , second only to photons when it comes to number density ; @xmath0 oscillation experiments tell us that they are massive @xcite and measure the mass split between @xmath0mass eigenstates , so that the largest split ( @xmath13ev from atmospheric @xmath0 s ) is a lower limit on the heaviest @xmath0 mass .",
    "particle experiments have placed various upper limits on the absolute @xmath0 mass scale .",
    "the mainz and troitsk experiments , measuring the end  point of the electron energy distribution in tritium @xmath1 decay , gave a 95% c.l .",
    "limit @xmath14ev @xcite .",
    "a further controversial detection of an absolute @xmath0 mass came from the  heidelberg - moscow ( hm ) experiment ; on the basis of its outputs , a part of the experiment team claims a @xmath15 lower limit @xmath16ev @xcite ( the mass measured by neutrinoless double @xmath1 decay ( @xmath17 ) experiments , @xmath18 , is however a different combination of mass eigenvalues than the mass @xmath19 , from tritium @xmath1 decay ) .    in 2011 , the experiment katrin @xcite , also studying tritium @xmath1 decay , is expected to start taking data . with a prospected sensitivity of @xmath20",
    ", it should be able to detect @xmath10 values in the range of the @xmath21 claim .    at present ,",
    "the best upper limits on the @xmath0 mass scale come from cosmology , yielding @xmath22ev @xcite and @xmath23ev ( at 95% c.l . ) , depending on data sets and cosmological models @xcite .",
    "all this is true if the possibility of a dde  cdm coupling is neglected .    in this paper , similarly to what is done in @xcite , we will allow for such a coupling , reporting for the first time results when baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data are taken into account . then we consider the @xmath0 mass limits set by a part of the hm collaboration ( kkdc claim , herafter ) , and impose this as a prior on @xmath24 . finally we shall investigate how a @xmath25 detection from katrin would affect limits on coupling .",
    "the possibility that forthcoming neutrino experiments yield mass values in apparent conflict with cosmic data had been considered by various authors .",
    "the most promising option , perhaps , had been discussed by @xcite , who found that allowing @xmath26 , the state parameter of de , to take values @xmath27 eased such constrast .",
    "here we compare this option with the coupling option and find that the latter one leads to a drastically better agreement between terrestrial and cosmological measures .    in the following section we discuss our cosmological model and",
    "outline the observable effects of the cdm - dde coupling and massive @xmath0 s . in section [ sec : nu ]",
    "we discuss the experimental bounds on the absolute @xmath0 mass scale .",
    "the data and methods used are presented in section [ sec : data ] , while section [ sec : results ] is devoted to reporting and discussing our results . in section [ sec : summary ]",
    "we summarize our findings and conclude .",
    "our models differ from the standard @xmath5cdm in three different aspects : ( i ) de is a self  interacting scalar field @xmath28 rather than a cosmological constant @xmath5 .",
    "( ii ) a linear dde  cdm coupling is allowed .",
    "( iii ) we allow @xmath0 s to be massive .",
    "we shall consider the ratra - peebles ( rp ) potential @xcite and a sugra self  interaction potentials @xcite , reading @xmath29 respectively ; they allow tracker solutions for any @xmath30 . for both potentials ,",
    "once @xmath31 and @xmath5 are assigned , the de density parameter @xmath32 is uniquely defined . in our fitting procedure ,",
    "however , we use @xmath32 and @xmath33 as free parameters .    limits on these models _ without _ coupling between de and cdm have been studied in @xcite . for most cosmological parameters , wmap5 results lead to a slight narrowing of error bars , in respect to wmap3 . in the case of @xmath34 , however , @xcite find a significant shift downward of the 2@xmath35 upper limit on the energy scale @xmath5 . in the sugra case ,",
    "in particular , only @xmath36 is allowed .",
    "such small values are well below the range motivated by particle physics",
    ". therefore the physical appeal of the sugra potential is spoiled .    following the procedure in refs .",
    "@xcite we assume a linear coupling between the de and cdm energy components , which leads to the coupled equations @xmath37 @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the scale factor , @xmath40 is cdm density , @xmath41 denotes the coupling strength .",
    "we then define the dimensionless coupling parameter @xmath42 used as a free parameter for our cosmological models . for",
    "a more thorough discussion of the effects of coupling on dde and cdm evolutions , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "let us however outline that , when the @xmath1 degree of freedom is opened , @xmath5 values as large as 30@xmath43gev become allowed , at the 1@xmath35 level , while , at the 2@xmath35 level , no significant constraint on the energy scale @xmath5 remains . even for the rp potential ,",
    "for which a limit @xmath44 held , in the absence of coupling , values @xmath45 become allowed .",
    "the effects of massive neutrinos in cosmology have been studied thoroughly for many years , and we refer to @xcite for an extensive review of the topic .",
    "cosmological observations are mostly sensitive to the sum of @xmath0masses , @xmath46 , related to the @xmath0 density parameter by the relation @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath48ev , most @xmath0 s were still relativistic at matter - radiation equality and act then as radiation , so postponing the equality compared to a model where all the dm is cold .",
    "when keeping the total dm density constant , increasing @xmath49 shifts the peaks of the anisotropy spectrum @xmath50 to lower @xmath51 and boosts their heights .    when it comes to the matter power spectrum @xmath52 , the main effect is @xmath0 free - streaming from small scale fluctuations , damping @xmath52 for large wavenumbers  @xmath53 .",
    "the combined effects on @xmath50 and @xmath52 spectra , when compared with observations , lead then to the limits outlined above @xcite .",
    "these effects , however , as outlined in @xcite , are almost opposite to those of dde  cdm coupling , for both @xmath50 and @xmath52 .",
    "a fisher  matrix analysis then shows a strong degeneracy between the @xmath1 and @xmath46 parameters . pinning down one of the parameters by some other means clearly results in improved limits on the other parameter",
    "two different ways are being followed to measure the absolute scale of @xmath0 masses : @xmath17 and tritium @xmath1 decay experiments .",
    "the @xmath17  process can only occur if @xmath0 s are massive majorana spinors , _",
    "i.e. _ they coincide with their own antiparticles . from the measurement of @xmath54 ( @xmath17  half life )",
    "one can then deduce an effective mass @xmath55 , being @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the pmns @xmath0 mixing matrix , @xmath58 are mass eigenvalues , @xmath59 is the electron mass .",
    "@xmath60 , the nuclear matrix element relevant for the nuclide considered , is the main problem with @xmath17 , because of its large theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the most sensitive limits , up to now , were derived from detectors enriched in @xmath61ge .",
    "using such nuclide , the heidelberg ",
    "moscow ( hm ) @xcite and the igex @xcite gave the limits @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "however , a part of the hm collaboration published results claiming a more than @xmath64 detection of a signal , giving an effective neutrino mass of @xmath65ev ( @xmath15 limits ) @xcite ( which we refer to as the kkdc claim ) .    in view of nuclear matrix uncertainties ,",
    "this claim is not in contradiction with another @xmath17 experiment , cuoricino @xcite , based on @xmath66te , placing an upper limit of @xmath67ev .",
    "both @xmath66te and @xmath61ge double@xmath1 decays are however still being investigated through the cuore and the gerda experiments , respectively .",
    "the cuore experiment @xcite is running in the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ( lngs ) , where the gerda experiment @xcite is also being placed .",
    "tritium @xmath1 decay is a different road to the absolute neutrino mass scale , where one accurately measures the energy distribution of the outgoing electron , and uses this to infer an effective electron neutrino mass , @xmath68 .",
    "currently , the best limits on @xmath25 from tritium @xmath1 decay come from the mainz and troitsk experiments , yielding an upper limit of @xmath69ev ( 95% c. l. ) .",
    "the much more sensitive katrin experiment @xcite is scheduled to start taking data this year . when completed , katrin is expected to reach a sensitivity of @xmath70 , and thus be able to confirm the kkdc claim .",
    "we use a modified version of the public program camb @xcite to calculate cmb and matter power spectra . a modified version of the public mcmc  engine cosmomc @xcite",
    "is used to generate confidence limits on the parameters : \\{@xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath1 , @xmath24}. here @xmath78 are the reduced density parameters of baryons , cdm ; @xmath73 is the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance , @xmath74 is the optical depth , @xmath75 and @xmath79 are the primordial scalar spectral index and amplitude ( at @xmath80 ) .",
    "we marginalize over sz amplitude .",
    "the parameters above are given flat priors , unless otherwise is explicitly stated .",
    "we mostly use two different combinations of cosmological data sets ; wmap5 data only , and wmap5 plus other cosmological data ( referred to as wmap5++ ) . for the sake of comparison ,",
    "in a specific case , we also consider the option of omitting bao constraints , as specified below .",
    "we then apply priors on @xmath0 mass according to the kkdc claim and the prospected katrin results .",
    "data sets and priors used are described in the following .",
    "the mcmc chains are run on the titan cluster at oslo university .",
    "firstly , we tested our models using only the five year data from the wmap measurements of the cmb radiation ( wmap5 ) @xcite .",
    "the wmap5 data are analyzed with the fortran 90 likelihood code provided with the data release .    in wmap5++",
    "we then included the galaxy power spectrum from the 2df survey @xcite , snia data from the snls survey @xcite , and added gaussian priors on the hubble parameter of @xmath81 from the hst key project @xcite , the physical baryon density , @xmath82 @xcite inferred from the @xmath83he abundance after big bang nucleosynthesis , and bao data from @xcite .",
    "the bao analysis in @xcite includes both the sdss dr7 data and data from 2df .",
    "angular distance measurements are compared at @xmath84 and @xmath85 , by using the distance measure @xmath86 . here",
    "@xmath87 is the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch ( see @xcite ) and @xmath88^{1/3}$ ] , where @xmath89 is the angular diameter distance .",
    "this provides information on the late expansion of the universe , which is important to constrain de nature . following @xcite , from the bao analysis ,",
    "the inferred likelihood @xmath90 of a model can be estimated by @xmath91 , where @xmath92      in order to include kkdc priors on @xmath0 mass , we use the procedure in refs .",
    "@xcite . to account for the dispersion in nuclear matrix ( @xmath60 ) estimates , we follow @xcite , where upper and lower extremes from a compilation of _ reliable _ theoretical estimates are used , defining a @xmath93 uncertainty width of @xmath60 .",
    "combined with the uncertainty in @xmath94 , this results in a kkdc prior of @xmath95 ( at @xmath96 ) . in this mass range",
    "the @xmath0 mass eigenvalues are almost degenerate , so that we can use that @xmath97 without any loss of accuracy .",
    "as far as katrin is concerned , we use their expected uncertainty @xmath98ev@xmath99 for a gaussian distribution around a best - fit value @xmath100 , as in refs .",
    "we then assume a fiducial value @xmath101ev ( @xmath102ev ) , as a compromise between cosmological upper limits and kkdc lower limit .",
    "kkdc and katrin priors are imposed in the post processing of mcmc chains , using a modified version of the getdist program provided with the cosmomc package .",
    "a first point we want to remark is that including the bao prior in the likelihood analysis causes just minor shifts on the limits , as shown in table [ tab : limits ] , and does absolutely not conflict with previous findings .    .we",

    "+ .1truecm    this figure confirms the findings of @xcite , also when the more limited data set considered by them ( including , _",
    "i.e. _ , just wmap3 outputs ) is replaced by the whole system of data considered in the rest of this work .",
    "as is known , sugra ( or rp ) uncoupled cosmologies yield no significant likelihood improvement ( or worsening ) in respect to @xmath5cdm .",
    "they are therefore analogous benchmarks for model likelihood confrontation .",
    "it is then clear that , if we just allow @xmath26 to run in the _ phantom _ range , we hardly gain a @xmath116@xmath35 likelihood improvement . on the contrary , if we open the coupling option , already with @xmath112  ev , we approach @xmath117@xmath35 s ; passing from 2 to 4@xmath35 means achieving statistical significance .",

    "if the upcoming katrin experiments confirm a neutrino mass in the range allowed by the kkdc experiment , this will on its own standing give a statistically significant detection of a non - zero @xmath1 .",
    "other options considered before , to try to reconcile cosmic data with @xmath0 mass in such range , are far less effective .",
    "in particular , even if the option @xmath4 is added to @xmath5cdm models , a prior @xmath124  ev badly modifies the likelihood distribution , so indicating an apparent conflict with cosmological measurements . on the contrary ,",
    "when such a prior is added to cosmological data , within the context of @xmath125 models , already ( slightly ) favored by data in respect to @xmath5cdm , it just leads to a further restriction of the allowed parameter area . in a sense",
    ", it appears a `` welcome '' new limit , just narrowing parameter error bars .",
    "a detection of a non - zero @xmath126ev by katrin would radically renew the cosmic scenario : the concordance cosmology , @xmath5cdm , would be statistically falsified ; a cdm  de coupling would become a concrete option .",
