    "there are various measures of complexity in the literature .",
    "a quantitative measure of complexity is useful to estimate the ability of a variety of physical or biological systems for organization .",
    "according to @xcite a complex world is interesting because it is highly structured .",
    "some of the proposed measures of complexity are difficult to compute , although they are intuitively attractive , e.g. the algorithmic complexity @xcite defined as the length of the shortest possible program necessary to reproduce a given object .",
    "the fact that a given program is indeed the shortest one , is hard to prove . in contrast",
    ", there is a class of definitions of complexity , which can be calculated easily i.e. the _ simple _ measure of complexity @xmath0 according to shiner , davison , landsberg ( sdl ) @xcite , and the _ statistical _ measure of complexity @xmath1 , defined by l@xmath2pez - ruiz , mancini , calbet ( lmc ) @xcite .    whereas the perfect measure of complexity is as yet unknown , the present work reports analysis of electron densities at atoms .",
    "we specially refer to the shell structure ( periodicity ) , using two of the simplest of complexity measures , sdl and lmc calculated as functions of the atomic number @xmath3 .",
    "this is a continuation of our previous work @xcite .",
    "those measures have been criticized in the literature @xcite and a discussion is presented in section [ sec : sec4 ] .",
    "our calculations are facilitated by our previous experience and results for the information entropy in various quantum systems ( nuclei , atoms , atomic clusters and correlated atoms in a trap - bosons ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a remarkable result is the universal property for the information entropy @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of particles of the quantum system and @xmath11 , @xmath12 are constants dependent on the system under consideration @xcite .",
    "in fact , if one has a physical model yielding probabilities which describe a system , then one can use them to find @xmath13 and consequently calculate the complexity of the system ( in our case the atom ) as function of @xmath3 .",
    "this was done in @xcite , where we calculated the shannon information entropies in position - space ( @xmath14 ) and momentum - space ( @xmath15 ) and their sum @xmath16 as functions of the atomic number @xmath3 ( @xmath17 ) in atoms .",
    "roothaan - hartree - fock electron wave functions ( rhf ) , for @xmath18 , were employed @xcite . for @xmath19",
    "there is no electron - electron effect .",
    "higher values of @xmath3 ( @xmath20 ) , due to the relativistic effects , are not considered .",
    "analytic wavefunctions are available in @xcite only for @xmath3 up to 54 .",
    "their importance lays in the fact that we can derive accurate wavefunctions in momentum space ; in order to assure that the integration is accurate . in @xcite",
    "we calculated the sdl measure with rhf densities for @xmath21 . in the present work",
    "we calculate lmc measure in the same region of @xmath3 , for the sake of comparison",
    ". one could consider the case of hartree - fock wavefunctions for the extended region @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "it turns out that both cases are satisfactory ( work in progress ) .",
    "in @xcite and the present work , we examine if complexity of an atom is an increasing or decreasing function of @xmath3 .",
    "this is related with the question whether physical or biological systems are able to organize themselves , without the intervention of an external factor , which is a hot subject in the community of scientists interested in complexity .",
    "however , special attention should be paid with respect to the meaning of complexity or structure , which may depend on the system under consideration . in the case of atoms , the overall electrons through pair - wise electron - electron interaction under the external nuclear potential ,",
    "lead to the characteristic electron probability distribution .",
    "the selected information measure which shows up in this manner is employed to estimate complexity .",
    "periodicity is clearly revealed here .    in section [ sec : sec2 ]",
    "we review briefly measures of information content and complexity .",
    "section [ sec : sec3 ] contains our numerical results for the lmc measure and discussion . in section [ sec : sec4 ] we comment on the validity of sdl and lmc measures .",
    "the class of measures of complexity considered in the present work have two main features i.e. they are easily computable and are based on previous knowledge of information entropy @xmath13 .",
    "the shannon information entropy in position space @xmath14 is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the electron density distribution normalized to one .",
    "the corresponding information entropy @xmath15 in momentum space is defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the momentum density distribution normalized to one .",
    "the total information entropy is @xmath27 and it is invariant to uniform scaling of coordinates , i.e. does not depend on the units used to measure @xmath28 and @xmath29 , while the individual @xmath30 and @xmath31 do depend @xcite .",
    "@xmath13 represents the information content of the quantum system ( in bits if the base of the logarithm is 2 or nats if the logarithm is natural ) . for a discrete probability distribution @xmath32",
    ", one defines instead of @xmath13 , the corresponding quantities @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 the uniform ( equiprobable ) probability distribution @xmath37 , gives the maximum entropy of the system .",
    "it is noted that the value of @xmath34 can be lowered if there is a constraint on the probabilities \\{@xmath38}.    another measure of the information content of a quantum system is the concept of information energy @xmath39 defined by onicescu @xcite , who tried to define a finer measure of dispersion distribution than that of shannon information entropy .",
    "onicescu s measure is discussed in @xcite .    for a discrete probability distribution ( @xmath40 ) , @xmath39 is defined as @xmath41 while for a continuous one @xmath42 is defined by @xmath43 one can define a measure for information content analogous to shannon s @xmath13 by the relation @xmath44 for three dimensional spherically symmetric density distributions @xmath24 and @xmath26 , in position- and momentum - spaces respectively , one has @xmath45",
    "@xmath46    the product @xmath47 is dimensionless and can be considered as a measure of dispersion or concentration of a quantum system . @xmath13 and @xmath39 are reciprocal .",
    "thus we can redefine @xmath48 as @xmath49 in order to be able to compare @xmath13 and @xmath39 .",
    "landsberg @xcite defined the order parameter @xmath50 ( or disorder @xmath51 ) as @xmath52 where @xmath13 is the information entropy ( actual ) of the system and @xmath53 the maximum entropy accessible to the system .",
    "it is noted that @xmath54 corresponds to perfect order and predictability while @xmath55 means complete disorder and randomness .    in @xcite a measure of complexity @xmath0",
    "was defined of the form @xmath56 which is called the `` simple complexity of _ disorder _ strength @xmath57 and _ order _ strength @xmath58 '' .",
    "one has a measure of category i if @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where complexity is an increasing function of _ disorder _ , while category ii is when @xmath60 , @xmath61 and category iii when @xmath62 and @xmath61 where complexity is an increasing function of _",
    "order_. in category ii complexity vanishes at zero _ order _ and zero _ disorder _ and has a maximum of @xmath63 several cases for both @xmath57 and @xmath58 non - negative are shown in fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath0 is shown as a function of @xmath51 . in our previous work @xcite we obtained @xmath64 or @xmath65 as a function of @xmath3 and plotted the dependence of @xmath0 on the atomic number @xmath3 .",
    "we employed @xmath66 according to rigorous inequalities holding to atoms @xcite , which hold for other systems as well ( nuclei , atomic clusters and atoms in a trap  bosons ) as verified in @xcite .",
    "these inequalities are    @xmath67    the lower and the upper limits can be written , for density distributions normalized to one    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the mean square radius and @xmath70 is the kinetic energy .",
    "we employ in ( [ eq : omega ] ) @xmath71 according to relation ( [ eq : smax ] ) .    as an alternative",
    ", we may use instead of @xmath0 the following _ statistical _ measure of complexity @xmath1 due to l@xmath2pez - ruiz , mancini and calbet @xcite defined as @xmath72 where @xmath13 denotes the information content stored in the system ( in our case the information entropy sum @xmath16 ) and @xmath73 is the disequilibrium of the system i.e. the distance from its actual state to equilibrium @xcite defined for a discrete probability distribution @xmath74 as follows @xcite @xmath75    @xmath73 is the quadratic distance of the actual probability distribution @xmath74 to equiprobability . in the continuous case , the rectangular function @xmath76 , where @xmath77 , is the natural extension of the equiprobability distribution of the discrete case .",
    "thus the disequilibrium could be defined as @xmath78 if we redefine @xmath73 omitting the constant adding term in @xmath79 ( which is very small for large @xmath80 ) , the disequilibrium reads now @xmath81 where @xmath73 is positive for every distribution and minimal for the rectangular function which represents the equipartition . for large values of @xmath80 ( @xmath82 )",
    "relation ( [ eq : eq24 ] ) gives @xmath83    another derivation of the formula ( [ eq : d - onedim ] ) for continuous @xmath42 can be found in section 3 of @xcite by using the rnyi generalized entropy @xmath84 where @xmath85 is an index running over all the integer values .",
    "according to @xcite @xmath13 and @xmath73 are the two basic ingredients for calculating complexity . in our 3-dimensional case , we employ instead of ( [ eq : d - onedim ] ) the formula @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 are defined in ( [ eq : er ] ) , ( [ eq : ek ] ) .",
    "relation ( [ eq : d-3dim ] ) extends the definition of measure of disequilibrium of the system according to lmc , to our case , where we are interested jointly in position- and momentum - spaces .",
    "it turns out that lmc definition of disequilibrium @xmath73 ( [ eq : d - onedim ] ) is identical to onicescu s formula ( [ eq : oni-1 ] ) for the information energy @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , inspired by the work of l@xmath2pez - ruiz , mancini and calbet , a new interpretation of onicescu information energy may be proposed i.e. it represents the disequilibrium of the system or distance from equilibrium . additionally in our case something new is introduced ,",
    "that is the effect of a delicate balance between conjugate spaces , reflected in the sum @xmath89 and the product @xmath90 .",
    "both @xmath13 and @xmath73 are dimensionless .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath3 for atoms has been calculated recently in @xcite . in the present letter",
    "we calculate @xmath5 employing the same rhf wave functions in the same region @xmath91 , for the sake of comparison .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "we compare them with @xmath4 shown in fig . 3 of @xcite for @xmath92 .",
    "in all ( six ) cases we observe that the measures of complexity show local minima at closed shells atoms , namely for @xmath3=10 ( ne ) , 18 ( ar ) , 36 ( kr ) .",
    "the physical meaning of that behavior is that the electron density for those atoms is the most compact one compared to neighboring atoms .",
    "the local maxima can be interpreted as being far from the most compact distribution ( low ionization potential systems ) .",
    "this does not contradict common sense and satisfies our intuition .",
    "there are also local minima for @xmath3=24 ( cr ) , 29 ( cu ) , 42 ( mo ) .",
    "those minima are due to a specific change of the arrangement of electrons in shells .",
    "for example , going from @xmath3=24 ( cr ) with electron configuration [ ar]@xmath93 to the next atom @xmath3=25 ( mn ) , with configuration [ ar]@xmath94 , it is seen that one electron is added in an s - orbital ( highest ) .",
    "the situation is similar for @xmath3=29 ( cu ) and @xmath3=42 ( mo ) .",
    "the local minimum for @xmath95 ( pd ) is due to the fact that pd has a @xmath96 electron configuration with extra stability of electron density .",
    "it has no @xmath97 electron , unlike the neighboring atoms .",
    "there are also fluctuations of the complexity measures within particular subshells .",
    "this behavior can be understood in terms of screening effects within the subshell .",
    "the question naturally arises if the values of complexity correlate with properties of atoms in the periodic table .",
    "an example is the correlation of onicescu information content @xmath48 with the ionization potential ( fig . 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "a more detailed / systematic study is needed , which is beyond the scope of the present report .",
    "our calculations in @xcite show a dependence of complexity on the indices of disorder @xmath57 and order @xmath58 . in @xcite , we made a general comment that there are fluctuations of complexity around an average value and atoms can not grow in complexity as @xmath3 increases .",
    "the second part of our comment needs to be modified .",
    "various values of ( @xmath57,@xmath58 ) lead to different trends of @xmath4 i.e. increasing , decreasing or approximately constant .",
    "in addition , in the present letter we compare @xmath5 with @xmath4 and we find a significant overall similarity between the curves @xmath98 and @xmath5 by plotting @xmath5 and @xmath99 in the same fig .",
    "( [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the numerical values are different but a high degree of similarity is obvious by simple inspection .",
    "there is also the same succession of local maxima and minima at the same values of @xmath3 .",
    "less striking similarities are observed for other values of ( @xmath100 ) as well , e.g. @xmath101 and @xmath5 .",
    "concluding , the behavior of sdl complexity depends on the values of the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the statistical measure lmc displays an increasing trend as @xmath3 increases .",
    "an effort to connect the aforementioned measures , implies that lmc measure corresponds to sdl when the magnitude of disorder @xmath102 and of order @xmath103 . in other words , if one insists that sdl and lmc behave similarly as functions of @xmath3 , then we can conclude that complexity shows an overall increasing behavior with @xmath3 .",
    "their correlation gives for atoms the strength of disorder @xmath104 and order @xmath103 .",
    "a final comment seems appropriate : an analytical comparison of the similarity of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is not trivial . combining equations ( [ eq : omega ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma ] ) we find for the sdl measure @xmath105 while for the lmc one has @xmath106 @xmath13 and @xmath66 depend on @xmath3 as follows @xmath107 ( almost exact fitted expression ) @xcite , while @xmath108 ( a rough approximation ) .",
    "we mention that @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 are known but different functionals of @xmath24 and @xmath26 according to relations ( [ eq : equ1 ] ) , ( [ eq : equ2 ] ) and ( [ eq : er ] ) , ( [ eq : ek ] ) respectively .",
    "it is noted that our numerical calculations were carried out with exact values of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , while our fitted expressions for @xmath109 , @xmath110 are presented in order to help the reader to appreciate approximately the trend of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "complexity is a multi - faceted and context dependent concept , difficult to be quantified .",
    "it is extremely difficult at present to define complexity under all possible circumstances .",
    "instead , one can choose a pragmatic approach and use as a starting point definitions of _ complexity _ found in the literature and attempt to evolve the existing framework .",
    "thus , we have chosen the _",
    "simple _ sdl measure and the _ statistical _ lmc one , which are relatively easy to compute .",
    "the question naturally arises if the above measures do represent the concept of complexity as expected from semantics , intuition or other general criteria .",
    "sdl and lmc measures have also been criticized in several aspects @xcite , some of them are the following :    1 .",
    "all systems with the same disorder @xmath51 have the same @xmath0 i.e. the function @xmath111 is universal . 2 .",
    "landsberg s definition of disorder @xmath64 does not describe properly and does not capture the system s structure , pattern , organization , or symmetries .",
    "3 .   the calculation in @xcite of @xmath112 for equilibrium ising systems is not clear .    in our previous and present work",
    "we use ground state electronic densities of atoms to evaluate @xmath4 and @xmath5 . at present",
    "it is not possible to answer semantic or sophisticated questions as the ones raised in @xcite and described above .",
    "one can not claim that sdl measure is _ the measure of complexity _ but it is a _ simple _ measure , indicating that it can be used as a starting point . to our knowledge , there are no other studies of _ complexity _ in quantum systems as functions of the number of particles",
    ".    the definition of @xmath0 is based on landsberg s disorder @xmath51 in terms of information measures @xmath13 , @xmath113 available as functions of @xmath10 . by definition @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    "are related by @xmath114 .",
    "an alternative approach where @xmath51 and @xmath50 should be considered independent of each other , is an open one . before considering such an extension , we calculate @xmath115 given in ( [ eq : eq19 ] ) , where @xmath13 and @xmath71 show different non - trivial dependence on @xmath10 . in this sense",
    "the universality of @xmath111 is modified : @xmath115 depends on the quantum system under consideration , i.e. atoms @xcite , nuclei , atomic clusters e.t.c .",
    "( work in progress ) . instead of varying the number of particles @xmath10",
    ", one could keep it constant , and study the effect on _ complexity _ of other parameters of the system",
    ". a welcome property of a definition of complexity supporting its validity might be the following : if one complicates the system by varying some of its parameters , and this leads to an increase of the adopted measure of _ complexity _ , then one could argue that this measure describes the complexity of the system properly",
    ".    there have been several criticisms regarding the lmc measure of complexity in the sense that it does not deserve the adjective _ statistical _ , it is not a general measure that quantifies structure and it is not an extensive quantity @xcite .",
    "analogous arguments with sdl could be given to support the use of lmc as a first working prototype of complexity to be modified by more sophisticated models .",
    "in @xcite various properties of the sdl measure are examined and a modification is attempted to remove its insensitivity to system differences . however in our present ( quantum ) case of atoms , by employing solely electron density distributions , it is difficult to check these ideas .",
    "in addition , the similarity of the qualitative behavior of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for atoms used as a case study ( although they obey different definitions ) is interesting .",
    "it shows that both measures share some common traits and correlate strongly with the periodicity of the elements in the periodic table .",
    "an important issue is the question if @xmath6 and @xmath1 are true measures of complexity ( structure , pattern etc ) or are just functionals of electron densities .",
    "further research is needed to clarify their region of validity and applicability as measures of complexity .",
    "information entropy is an extensive quantity .",
    "the question arises if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are extensive or intensive quantities , what is their thermodynamic limit , their behavior at the boundaries ( large or small order ) , their properties under scaling transformations e.t.c .",
    "for example , it is stated in @xcite that @xmath1 is neither an intensive nor an extensive thermodynamic variable and it vanishes exponentially in the thermodynamic limit , for all one - dimensional , finite - range systems . however , in a broader context , @xmath0 and @xmath1 can serve as indicators of complexity , based on a probabilistic description . in some cases",
    "it can be applied in a setting wider or different than thermodynamics .",
    "such a case , is the calculation of @xmath1 for various shapes of probability distributions @xmath42 in @xcite , i.e. the rectangular , the isosceles  triangle , the gaussian and the exponential probability distributions which are classified according to the corresponding values of @xmath1 .",
    "another case is the present work , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are estimated for the ground state electron densities , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , of a quantum system ( atom ) at zero temperature . to our knowledge",
    ", such an application is done for the first time for a quantum system , and deserves more detailed investigation ( e.g. for excited states ) .",
    "it is true that there are certain shortcomings of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for various cases in statistical mechanics . in quantum systems further",
    "investigation is needed . our title `` _ _ @xmath118atoms as a testbed _ _ '' describes well our aim .",
