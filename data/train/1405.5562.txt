    "moduli spaces of real smooth objects can sometimes be equipped with a stratified boundary consisting of singular objects , namely the degenerations of the smooth objects . given a single point in the moduli space there is in general no canonical way to degenerate it to a stratum of real codimension one belonging to the boundary .",
    "for example , there is no canonical way to degenerate a smooth knot in the 3-sphere to a singular knot with exactly one ordinary double point and such that the degenerations of isotopic knots ( i.e. different points in the same moduli space ) are themselves isotopic as singular knots ( i.e. they belong to the same stratum of singular knots in the boundary ) .    in this paper we describe a completely new phenomenon : sometimes there is a canonical way to associate to each oriented generic loop in the moduli space a finite linear combination of strata of codimension one in its boundary , where the coefficients of the linear combination are elements in a ring of laurent polynomials , and such that homologous loops are mapped to the same combination .",
    "if moreover there is a canonical loop up to homology in the moduli space , then it is natural to call the corresponding finite linear combination of strata of codimension one a _",
    "singularization _ of the moduli space .",
    "_ we have found non - trivial singularizations in two cases : long knots in 3-space and closed braids in the solid torus . _",
    "a non - trivial singularization is a machinery which transforms each invariant of the points of the moduli space into a new invariant . indeed",
    ", different moduli spaces are usually glued together along some strata of their boundary .",
    "a good example is vassiliev s space of all smooth maps of the real line into 3-space and which coincide with the identity onto a fixed line outside some compact set",
    ". each stratum of codimension one in the boundary is adjacent to no more than two moduli spaces .",
    "the _ canonical resolution of the singularization _ of a moduli space is defined by replacing each singular stratum by the corresponding adjacent moduli space ( i.e. we push the singular objects outside the moduli space into the adjacent moduli space ) .",
    "we can now evaluate each invariant of points of the moduli space on the canonical resolution of the singularization .",
    "moreover , we can iterate the construction .    since almost 100 years knot theory is mainly the construction of more and more sophisticated invariants ( as well of course as the study of their topological meaning and their interactions ) .",
    "all these invariants are constructed by using only @xmath3 of the moduli space of knots .",
    "we use now @xmath4 of the moduli space too .",
    "the canonical resolution of the singularization allows to transform potentially each given knot invariant into an infinite sequence of new knot invariants .",
    "for example we show that each invariant of the knot @xmath5 ( e.g. its hyperbolic volume ) is in fact an isotopy invariant of the positive trefoil !    our results are based on a surprising connection between two different discriminants : vassiliev s discriminant of singular long knots respectively singular closed braids on one side and the discriminant of non - generic projections of non - singular long knots into the plane respectively non - singular closed braids into the annulus on the other side .",
    "however , it seems to us that an important task in 3-dimensional topology would be to find an alternative construction of our singularization which does not use knot diagrams , i.e. projections into surfaces .",
    "this would perhaps allow to define singularizations for more classes of moduli spaces ( but of course we always need that the first betti number of the moduli space is non - trivial ) .",
    "it would definitely give also a better understanding of our singularization , which is based on very complicated combinatorics and hence it stays rather mysterious .",
    "we describe now briefly our main construction in the case of long knots and its main application so far .    a _ long knot _",
    "k is an oriented smoothly embedded copy of @xmath6 in @xmath7 which coincides with a fixed straight line ( e.g. the real axes in @xmath8 ) outside a compact set",
    ".    let @xmath9 be the _ topological moduli space _ of the long knot @xmath10",
    ", i.e. the space of all long knots smoothly isotopic to k ( seen as one dimensional @xmath11-submanifolds of @xmath12 and which are standard near infinity ) , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the strata of codimension one in the boundary @xmath13 consist of long singular knots with exactly one ordinary double point , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we call the ordinary double point _ planar _ if the projection to @xmath8 of the plane spanned by the tangent vectors at the double point is surjective . to each planar double point",
    "we can attach a _ sign _",
    ", namely the sign of the crossing which is created from the double point by deforming the singular knot into @xmath9 .",
    "an isotopy of a long knot with an ordinary planar double point is called _ planar _ if the double point stays an ordinary planar double point within the whole isotopy .",
    "planar isotopy is a refinement of the usual notion of isotopy for singular knots , namely we do _ not _ allow the move shown in fig .",

    "@xmath15 is the @xmath14$]-module freely generated by all planar isotopy classes of long singular knots with exactly one signed ordinary double point in @xmath13 , modulo the following _ embedded 1t - relation _ :",
    "a singular knot is 0 in @xmath15 if and only if the corresponding smoothing link is a split link which contains a trivial knot ( long or compact ) as a component ( e.g. as in fig .  [ smlink ] ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath16 the natural splitting of @xmath15 with respect to the sign of the double points .    instead of a 0-cocycle with values in some algebra of abstract chord diagrams ( the _ kontsevich integral _ ,",

    "the value of @xmath17 on a loop in the topological moduli space @xmath9 is an invariant of the homotopy class of the loop , and hence of the homology class since the values of @xmath17 lie in an abelian module . in order to obtain an isotopy invariant of k itself we need canonical choices of loops in @xmath9 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath19 the @xmath14$]-module freely generated by all oriented unframed long knot types .",

    "we consider their connected sum @xmath25 as a long knot and we drag @xmath23 through @xmath24 and then again @xmath24 trough @xmath23 in the same direction .",
    "the result is an oriented loop in @xmath26 which we denote by @xmath27 .",
    "we show an example in fig .",

    "( here @xmath32 is the knot @xmath5 which has a diagram with 8 crossings and total writhe + 4 . )",
    "it follows that each invariant of @xmath32 is a new invariant of the positive trefoil ! for example , the simplicial volume of the right hand side , which is equal to twice the hyperbolic volume of the complement of @xmath5 , is an invariant of the positive trefoil .",
    "moreover , we can iterate the construction and consider @xmath33 and we get still new invariants of the positive trefoil .",
    "because of its fundamental importance we give the calculation of    @xmath30 in all details in section 4 , so that an interested reader can really check it .",

    "@xmath35    indeed , changing the framing of @xmath23 or @xmath24 would just add multiples of gramain loops , but @xmath17 vanishes on gramain s loop ( compare the next sections ) . using the canonical resolution , @xmath36 induces a bilinear form with values in @xmath19 .",
    "it follows directly from its definition and from the fact that @xmath17 does not depend on the choice of the point at infinity that the form @xmath36 is _ symmetric _ ( and _ even _ , in the sense that all coefficients on the diagonal are divisible by @xmath37 in @xmath14 $ ] ) .",
    "the trivial knot is evidently in the radical of @xmath36 .",

    "moreover , we can iterate @xmath36 and we can extract numerical knot invariants by combining it e.g. with the usual knot invariants . if conjecture 1 would be true then this would be certainly a big step towards a calculable complete knot invariant",
    ". it could even be that _ each _ non trivial knot invariant becomes a complete knot invariant by evaluating it on the a priori infinite tower of iterations .",
    "unfortunately , a computer program is missing for the moment in order to calculate @xmath36 for lots of examples .",
    "the reader who wants to get rapidly familiar with the new 1-cocycle @xmath17 can skip the next section and go directly to the definition of @xmath17 in section 3.1 and then to the examples in section 4.1 .",

    "a _ n - string link _ k is the disjoint union of n long knots where each component coincides with one of n fixed parallel lines to the real axes in @xmath8 outside some compact set .    examples of n - string links are n - cables of framed long knots and n - braids .",
    "the definitions of section 1 can be generalized in the evident way from long knots to string links .",
    "first of all we choose now an abstract closure of the string link to an oriented circle and we choose a point at infinity in the boundary of the string link ( in the case of long knots there are nt any choices ) .",
    "so , a string link is for us a circle with only a part of it embedded in 3-space and with a marked point in the remaining ( abstract ) part .    for each generic long knot ( or string link ) we have a finite number of _ vertical chords _ ,",
    "i.e. chords connecting points with the same @xmath6-coordinate .",
    "these points correspond to the crossings for the natural projection of the knot into @xmath8 .",
    "let k be an isotopy class of a long knot , i.e. a long knot up to smooth isotopy of long knots which is the identity outside a compact set .",
    "an _ embedded chord diagram for k _ is a trivalent graph obtained from a diagram for k together with exactly one vertical chord .",
    "the chord is _ oriented _ from the undercross to the overcross and it is _ signed _ by the usual sign of the corresponding ordinary crossing",
    "isotopy of an embedded chord diagram _ is a smooth isotopy of the trivalent graph and such that the vertical chord stays vertical all the time .",
    "in particular , each embedded chord diagram decomposes in a canonical way into a knot part and into the chord .",
    "if we contract the vertical chord and we drop the sign then we obtain a _ singular knot _ in the usual sense ( see e.g. @xcite )",
    ".    to each embedded chord diagram corresponds an underlying abstract chord diagram in the following way : the knot is an oriented circle with a marked point , which corresponds to the point at infinity , and an oriented signed arrow which connect points on the circle and which correspond to the oriented signed vertical chord ( with the direction from the under - cross to the over - cross ) .",
    "this is usually called a _ gauss diagram of k _ if all crossings of k are considered ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "so , the underlying abstract chord diagram is a sub - diagram of a gauss diagram",
    ". we will for brevity call it the _ underlying gauss diagram_.    there are two canonical loops associated to each long knot and which are homologically non - trivial for non trivial knots : gramain s loop , denoted by @xmath40 , and the fox - hatcher loop , denoted by @xmath41 .",
    "_ gramain s loop _ is induced by the rotation of the 3-space around the long axes of the long knot ( see @xcite ) .",
    "_ fox - hatcher s loop _ is defined as follows : one puts a pearl ( i.e. a small 3-ball @xmath42 ) on the closure of the long framed knot @xmath10 in the 3-sphere .",
    "the part of @xmath10 in @xmath43 is a long knot . pushing @xmath42",
    "once along the knot with respecting the framing induces the fox - hatcher loop in @xmath9 ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) . the homology class of rot(k )",
    "does not depend on the framing of k and changing the framing of k adds multiples of rot(k ) to hat(k ) .",
    "notice that the fox - hatcher loop has a canonical orientation induced by the orientation of the long knot .",

    "the complement in @xmath44 of a general n - string link t for @xmath45 does not contain any incompressible torus and its topological moduli space is contractible . in this case",
    "we consider the string link t as a tangle in a cube @xmath46 and we chose a partial closure @xmath47 of t outside the cube as shown e.g. in fig .",
    "[ partt ] .",
    "we consider now the resulting tangle @xmath48 of one component again as a long knot in 3-space and we can apply the fox - hatcher loop to it .",

    "gramain s loop can be represented by pushing the knot through a curl as shown in fig .",
    "[ gram ] ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the fox- hatcher loop corresponds to the following loop : we go on k from @xmath49 to the first crossing .",
    "if we arrive at an under - cross then we move the branch of the over - cross over the rest of the knot up to the end of k. if we arrive at an over - cross then we move the branch of the under - cross under the rest of the knot up to its end .",
    "we continue the process up to the moment when we obtain a diagram which is isotopic to our initial diagram of k ( see @xcite ) , see section 4.1 for examples .",

    "our construction of @xmath17 makes heavy use of the point at infinity on the knot ( so , we really need long knots ) .",
    "however @xmath17 does not depend on the choice of the point at infinity on @xmath10 since @xmath17 is a 1-cocycle already for unframed knots and two long knots are isotopic if and only if the corresponding closed knots in @xmath1 are isotopic .",

    "moreover , each move of the lines in the plane which preserves the transversality lifts to an isotopy of the lines in 3-space .",
    "however , the solutions of the classical tetrahedron equation are not well adapted in order to construct 1-cocycles for moduli spaces of knots .",

    "their contributions cancel out , because they have different writhe .",
    "it can happen for the type @xmath229 that the crossing @xmath211 becomes a new f - crossing with respect to @xmath212 for the new triple crossing .",

    "the singularizations are isotopic in this case and enter the equation for the singularization at the crossing @xmath212 of the triple crossings . hence sometimes the self - tangencies contribute non trivially to the first line ( when @xmath261 is different for the two self - tangencies but the singularizations are isotopic ) and sometimes they contribute non trivially to the second line ( when the third branch passes between the branches of the self - tangency and consequently the singularizations of the self - tangencies are not isotopic but have the same weight @xmath261 ) .",
