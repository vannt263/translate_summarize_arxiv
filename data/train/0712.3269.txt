    "_ burst alert telescope ( bat)@xcite at @xmath1 05:12:13 ut on 2006 june 7@xcite .",
    "the _ swift _ spacecraft rapidly slewed , directing the x - ray telescope ( xrt)@xcite and the ultraviolet and optical telescope ( uvot)@xcite at the bat position .",
    "the observations commenced at @xmath2  sec after the bat trigger in the optical / uv and @xmath3  sec in the x - ray , providing broad - band spectral and high time resolution light curves in the x - ray , optical , and ultraviolet .",
    "the x - ray light curve shows two bright flares , the first of which at @xmath4 sec is also observed in the bat energy range @xmath5  kev .",
    "the second flare occurs at @xmath6 sec and is marginally ( if at all ) detected by bat ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : lightcurves ] ) .",
    "the optical emission is at first quite faint , then rises nearly three magnitudes over a time span of about @xmath7 sec .",
    "the peak in the optical is not simultaneous with the x - ray flares .",
    "historically , ground - based follow - up optical observations of grbs usually started at least several minutes after the burst occurred , and it has not been unusual for optical observations to start several hours into the afterglow phase . over the past few years",
    "fast - slewing robotic telescopes e.g. @xcite and the _ swift _ mission @xcite have made it possible to observe the first few minutes of optical emission from grbs . in some cases : grb 990123 @xcite , grb 041219a @xcite , grb 050820a @xcite , grb 051109a , grb 051111@xcite , grb 060124 @xcite , grb 060418 @xcite , grb 060526 @xcite , grb 060607a , grb 061007 @xcite , grb 061121 @xcite , grb 070616 @xcite the optical emission has been observed during the prompt gamma - ray emission . in the case of grb 990123",
    "there is no correlation between the structure of the gamma - ray light curve and the optical flux @xcite .",
    "if anything , there is an apparent anti - correlation , although the optical data is not well sampled . on the other hand ,",
    "all the other bursts above show a correlation between the optical and gamma - ray fluxes . in the case of grb 060124 , although the optical flux slightly increases during the main peak at about @xmath8  sec , its relative rise is much smaller than the rise in gamma - ray and x - ray fluxes . in the case of grb 060607a , clearly there is no correlation between the dominant component of the early optical and x - ray emissions .",
    "the optical flux arrived at its peak when the x - ray emission was decreasing .",
    "a similar behaviour was also observed in grb 060418 @xcite .",
    "it is not yet clear how the prompt gamma - ray emission is related to the later emissions in the lower energy bands .",
    "_ swift _ xrt observations have shown that the x - ray early emission of the most grbs exhibit a very steep power - law decline with ( @xmath9 , where the flux at time @xmath10 is @xmath11 ) decay within @xmath12  sec @xcite ) .",
    "this decay was expected to be caused by the high - latitude emission from the internal shocks that are driving the prompt high - energy emission , and therefore is not produced by the same mechanism that drives the late - time afterglow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , presumably the external shock with the ism or wind . however , this rapid decay phase has not been observed in any optical early emission .",
    "moreover , the high - latitude emission should satisfy a strict relation between @xmath13 and the photon index @xmath14 : @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this relation is however only satisfied in a small fraction of grbs with a steeply decaying x - ray tail emission which also do not show significant spectral evolution @xcite .",
    "the spectral evolution of the tail emission is another argument against high latitude origin of the tail .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that the high - latitude emission is not a dominant contributor in the tail emission .",
    "the fact that the light curves in different bands in general do not follow each other suggests that either multiple components should be involved @xcite and/or processes are chromatic and the emission evolves both in time and in energy .",
    "therefore , one should expect various degrees of correlation between the light curves in the different energy bands depending on the internal properties of the system and its environment .",
    "grb 060607a is a good example of how peculiar the relation between energy bands can be .",
    "the initial decay slope in x - ray is shallower than most bursts @xmath16 , and the optical light curve shows a peak uncorrelated to the flares in gamma - ray and x - ray .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the early optical and x - ray emissions as observed by _ swift _",
    "s uvot and xrt instruments .",
    "the goal is to compare the multi - band _ swift _ data , with a simple relativistic shock and synchrotron emission model , and to try to reconstruct the history of events leading to the prompt and afterglow emission as observed by _",

    "therefore , what we expect is an increasing minimum time variability with time , which is exactly what we are observing .",
    "however , as with expansion the signal becomes fainter and the variations become more difficult to observe , the increase in minimum variability scales is a consequence of both effects .",
    "as the speed of the passage of the shock front through a shell is limited to the speed of light , these timescales can be translated to the distance traveled by a relativistic ejecta .",
    "therefore , they constrain the initial size and/or variability scale of the fireball , and the distance to the central engine to @xmath173  cm in the rest frame of the engine .",
    "this is consistent with the estimation of the model explained in the appendix [ appendixa ] and applied to the data in sec.[section : modelling ] .",
    "the timescales are also another confirmation of the same origin for the prompt emission and flares seen in x - ray and optical bands .",

    "one possibility is that the external shock phase with ism / surrounding material began very early and smeared the high latitude emission .",

    "the smoothness of the joint lightcurve is a likely evidence that the initial smooth , sometimes very steep decay observed in the x - ray light curve of many grbs is directly related to the prompt emission and hence the term _ tail emission _ is a correct expression for this regime . as for the physical processes involved ,",

    "nonetheless , we show in appendix [ appendixb ] that if the time evolution of the bat spectrum index is taken into account , it is highly improbable to obtain such a smooth common light curve due to averaging or by chance , and one should observe a deviation between extrapolated bat light curve and what is observed by the xrt if there is not an intrinsic relation between the prompt and the tail emissions .",

    "another interesting observation from this plot is a gradual rise of the hardness ratio from the beginning of the shallow regime to a roughly constant plateau that does not decline even after the sharp break at @xmath178  sec .",
    "if the break was achromatic such a behaviour was expected , however the break is not achromatic .",

    "another explanation can be the onset of a forward external shock by the ism or circumburst material at a distance @xmath272  cm from the central engine .",
    "the question which arises here is : at these late times , what keeps the coherent magnetic field and the electron acceleration in the shell going ?",
    "do we need a continuous fall of circumburst material or arrival of late shells ( i.e. energy injection ) to the shell to keep the radiation level high ?",
    "are the stock of electrons and residual magnetic field enough to keep the low flux of the late time radiation ? in the first case either",
    "the circumburst material should exist at all distances after the prompt collision , or there must be a discontinuity in the emission between the end of the internal shock and the onset of the external forward shock .",
    "the same type of argument is relevant for the continuous energy injection .",
    "no discontinuity has been observed by _",
    "swift_. only a detailed knowledge of the origin of the ejecta , the shock , the state of the matter in the remnant after the prompt shock termination , and the surrounding material can clarify these issues .",
    "finally we try to explain the optical light curve of grb 060607a which has interesting behaviour rarely seen in other bursts .",
    "in general , optical light curves of _ swift _ bursts within the first few hundred seconds after the trigger , have a broad range of temporal indices , mostly consistent with decaying behaviour .",
    "after approximately 500s , all light curves are decaying ( oates et al . in prep ) . in few bursts including grb 060607a ( see figs .",
    "[ figure : lightcurves ] and [ figure : uvot_flare ] ) , grb 060418 @xcite , and grb 070616 @xcite an initial rise in the optical light curves is detected in all filter from blue to infrared .",
    "a number of interpretations for this behaviour have been put forward : the onset of external shock@xcite , forward shock with ism @xcite , deceleration of the forward shock@xcite(oates et al . in prep ) . here",
    "we argue that the most plausible reason for this behaviour is the gradual cooling and energy dissipation in the prompt shell and the entrance of @xmath258 to optical bands .",
    "the relatively shallow slope of the early x - ray light curve , @xmath273 may be the consequence of a slow evolution of @xmath258 which permitted the detection of its transition through the optical bands .    using eq . [",
    "equation : emevol ] and the argument about the evolution of @xmath274 , we can estimate @xmath258 at the peak time in optical light curve @xmath275 @xmath276  sec in the source rest frame , and we obtain @xmath277 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath278  nm , with in the optical blue band for the observer .",
    "therefore , we interpret the maximum of the light curve as the time where the characteristic synchrotron emission for the least energetic electrons enters to the optical bands . the approximate time evolution of @xmath258 according to the model used here is summarized in fig.[figure : em ] .",
    "the rising slope of the optical light curve is @xmath279 . according to the model",
    ", the slope in this regime is @xmath280 . with the estimated @xmath268 from the x - ray data ,",
    "the observed value is consistent with the interpretation of the peak as the passage of @xmath258 to optical bands .",
    "therefore , another component - external forward or reverse shock - is not required to explain the observations .",
    "although there are uv observations for this burst , they do not begin until hundreds of seconds after the rise .",
    "therefore it is not possible to see if they peak earlier than longer wavelengths , as would be expected from this interpretation .",
    "on the other hand , observations by the prompt telescope @xcite in @xmath67 , @xmath281 , @xmath282 , and @xmath283 are consistent with this interpretation .",
    "in fact the energy difference between @xmath67 and @xmath283 bands with respect to the energy difference between x - ray and optical is very small , and therefore the expected time shift between their arrival to maximum is very small and difficult to detect with the time resolution of ground telescopes . only uvot in event mode could be able to directly detect the shift , but it can not simultaneously observe with multiple filters . it may be possible to detect a small shift in the maximum by fitting the peak , but @xcite did not attempt this . nonetheless , in fig . 1 of @xcite which , includes the @xmath120 band data from the rem observations @xcite , shows a small delay between the peak time in the @xmath120 band at @xmath284  sec @xcite with respect to higher energy bands",
    "we should also mention that flares observed in gamma- and x - ray bands are marginally distinguishable in the uvot observations .",
    "this shows that as expected , the synchrotron emission from the flares is much harder than the cooling tail emission , and consequently no significant optical excess is observed during the x - ray flares .",
    "the lack of evidence for a significant external shock in the early low energy bands emission makes the claim of determination of the bulk lorentz factor @xcite unlikely , as it is based on the assumption that this peak is the result of a shock on the ism . in this case",
    "@xmath285 is the same as collision @xmath286 because ism is roughly at rest with respect to the source . but",
    "according to our results the peak is related to the prompt shock and so the ism / circumburst material had no significant contribution in its formation and properties .",
    "the rest of the optical light curve follows a power - law decay at least until @xmath287  sec without any change in the slope .",
    "the magnitude limits at later times are just brighter than the expected fluxes from a power - law decay and we can not claim that any late break in optical / uv bands has been observed . the flattening or slight brightening from @xmath288  sec to @xmath289  sec , ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : uvot_data ] ) is probably related to the weak x - ray flare that occurred during this period .",
    "although the number of data points in the light curve in this regime is very limited , one can speculate that the slope of the decline is slightly steeper in longer wavelengths .",
    "this can be interpreted as the hardening of the emission , probably due to fireball encountering the ism / circumburst material . in other words",
    ", it seems that a weak external shock starts a few thousands of seconds after the trigger and refreshes the prompt shell .",
    "regarding just optical data , this claim seems very speculative .",
    "however , the hardness ratio of x - ray bands is definitely increasing ( fig.[figure : lc_hr ] ) .",
    "this increases the hardness ratio to @xmath290 , i.e. @xmath258 moves to the x - ray band but with a smaller density for high energy electrons .",
    "as the shell is already decelerated , a few thousands of seconds later at @xmath291  sec the additional mass of the coalesced material from ism breaks the coherence of the magnetic field and the synchrotron emission at higher energy bands begins a steep power - law decay due to a break in the spectrum of the electrons .",
    "this does not affect the emission in the optical bands from slower electrons . in this sense",
    "one can say that the x - ray and optical emissions come from separate components .",
    "it is also possible that at least part of the optical emission comes from the heated - shocked material without the presence of a coherent magnetic field . in conclusion ,",
    "the break is not likely to be associated with the jet break , i.e. when @xmath292 , and the relativistic collimation is removed .      to end the discussion , we consider some of the alternative interpretations of the optical light curves .",
    "first we consider the possibility that the optical emission is produced by a forward or reverse external shock , and thus has a different origin than the prompt gamma ray and the early x - ray emission . considering first the forward shock case , the peak of the optical emission marks the onset of the afterglow where the peak time of the optical emission , @xmath275 , is associated with the deceleration time of the outflow @xmath293 , and with the optical emission at @xmath294 , most likely dominated by the forward shock with @xmath295 .",
    "this conclusion is similar to the results we obtained by considering the early x - ray and optical emissions from the tail emission in the prompt shell without evoking a second component and a separate origin for the optical and x - ray emissions . in fact , using the observed power - law spectrum of the early x - ray , we can estimate the expected optical flux by extending the spectrum to the optical bands .",
    "what we find is summarized in table [ table : optexpect ] .",
    "the observed magnitudes in this table are corrected for the milky way absorption which is only @xmath296 magnitude .",
    "they are not corrected for the host absorption because we do not have any information about the dust to gas ratio in the host galaxy . as discussed in sec.[section : specvar ] , the host of the most grbs have values similar to smc , @xmath297 magnitude .",
    "although the difference between the expected and the observed may partially be due to the absorption in the host , we also notice that discrepancies are time dependent , see table[table : optexpect ] .",
    "the value of @xmath298 varies from @xmath299  mag up to @xmath137  mag depending on the time interval .",
    "the observational errors of the observed magnitudes are at most @xmath300 at @xmath61 or @xmath301 at @xmath191 .",
    "they can not explain the large variations as well as differences between expectations and observations .",
    "therefore , we conclude that at least part of the difference between observations and expectations is intrinsic to the fireball .",
    "if the early x - ray and optical radiations have different origin , then the discrepancies between expectations and observations become even larger .",
    "this is because we must add the contribution in the optical flux of the other component to the contribution of the component producing the x - ray .",
    "we now consider the possibility of a reverse shock as the source of the early optical emission .",
    "the rising slope of the optical light curve at @xmath302 is @xmath303 , which - in the context of the standard reverse shock model that predicts a slope of @xmath304 - is too steep for the passage of @xmath258 through @xmath305 .",
    "the rising slope is a probe of the strength of the reverse shock and the observed slope suggests that the reverse shock is weak - the dimensionless parameter @xmath306^{1/3}/\\delta r_0)^{1/2}\\gamma^{-4/3}$ ] @xcite presenting the strength of the reverse shock is large @xmath307 .",
    "this lower limit on @xmath308 is valid both if the emission at @xmath302 is dominated by the forward external shock or if it is from a non - relativistic or at most mildly - relativistic reverse shock @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems that for this burst the contributions of these components are small .",
    "nonetheless , if the early optical emission is due to a reverse shock , the temporal slope of the rising phase also probes the external density profile .",
    "a wind - like density profile would produce a significantly slower rise than a uniform external density .",
    "the steep rise seems to favor a uniform external density over a wind - like density profile below and around the deceleration radius @xmath309 .",
    "more specifically , a wind - like external density profile could not produce such a sharp rise either by a forward or through a reverse shock even if the reverse shock is extremely weak ( @xmath310 ) and the outflow acts as a perfect piston as far as the external medium is concerned .",
    "rrrc + time + @xmath100  ( sec ) & @xmath311 & @xmath312 & @xmath313 +   + 97 & 10.7 & 15.70 & 5.00 + 175 & 13.2 & 14.75 & 1.55 + 262 & 11.8 & 15.15 & 3.35 +    another possible explanation is that the optical emission is mainly produced by the combination of reverse shock and energy injection .",
    "the latter is one of the possible causes for the slow decay of the optical light curve after the peak @xmath314 compared to the @xmath315 expected for an idealized reverse shock where the outflow has a sharp lower cutoff in @xmath286 .",
    "the observation of x - ray flares for this burst is also consistent with the additional outflow after the prompt shell .",
    "there is a minor break in the optical light ( seen more clearly in the data of @xcite at @xmath316  sec , roughly at the end of the bright x - ray flares and before the small x - ray / optical flare .",
    "this may be the evidence of the break in the reverse shock after a relatively flat regime following the initial rise @xcite .",
    "however , for this argument to be viable , the reverse shock should be significantly brighter than the forward shock . regarding the arguments above about the weakness of the reverse shock",
    ", it does not seem that we can associate this break to the reverse shock .",
    "we should also mention that the above break can be also explained as a hardening of the radiation at the arrival of a new shell responsible for the weak flare in xrt data ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : xrt_lc ] ) at @xmath317  sec .",
    "a similar break is also visible in the uvot light curve during the flare at @xmath171  sec , followed by a slightly steeper fall of the optical light curve most probably due to energy injection and hardening of the emission ( see fig . [",
    "figure : lightcurves ] ) .",
    "therefore , considering all the arguments together , the evidence for a dominant reverse shock is weak .",
    "after years of investigation and especially with the multi - band data from _ swift _ of more than 200 bursts , it is clear that complex physical processes are involved not only in the physics of the progenitor but also in the collisions between ejected material and the surroundings that at first sight seem simple .    in this work we applied the internal / external shock model as the source of observed emission to grb 060607a , one of the most peculiar gamma - ray bursts observed by _",
    "swift_. we tried to understand and interpret the acquired data and related processes partly qualitatively , partly quantitatively .",
    "we estimated the distance to the central engine where the collisions between shells occurred to be @xmath318  cm .",
    "this is consistent with the original suggestion of the model in which , internal shocks happen at a distance of @xmath319  cm from the central engine .",
    "we also found that the external shocks influence the afterglow of this burst only at late times ; most probably a few thousand seconds after the prompt emission .",
    "if our interpretations are correct , it seems that the coherent magnetic field in the fireball can have relatively long lifetime and the energy distribution of electrons can be much more complex than a simple power - law . based on the hardness ratio in the x - ray band we showed that there is a separation between population / sources of electrons responsible for the late x - ray and optical emission . in particular we conjectured the presence of a non - synchrotron , close to thermal component in the optical emission from the shocked heated material at late times in the afterglow of grbs .",
    "the measurement of the late time optical spectrum can verify this hypothesis . a better understanding of the relativistic plasma physics is also necessary and will provide realistic models for the evolution of fields and charged particles acceleration and energy distribution during the shock and their relation with the state of matter in the ejecta ( fireball ) .    [ [ appendixa ] ]    in this appendix we briefly review the main aspects and results of the shock model used for comparison with data .",
    "it is a reformulation of the relativistic shock models with only one synchrotron emitting shocked layer but more detailed parametrization of the physical processes and their time variation ( ziaeepour , in prep . ) .",
    "we consider a radiative shock between two relativistic spherical shells .",
    "for an observer in the rest frame of the fast shell , the kinetic energy of the falling particles from the slow shell is instantaneously emitted as the shells join and merge together .",
    "a far observer sees that the fast shell absorbs the slow one , its density and/or size increases and its lorentz factor decreases . during coalescence , we distinguish one region of unshocked material in each shell , and one shocked zone in which charged particles are accelerated by the coherent electric field produced be the shock . in presence of a coherent magnetic field ,",
    "these charged particles irradiate their energy as synchrotron radiation . the magnetic field is usually considered to be produced by the shock as well @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that there is an additional ambient magnetic field produced by the central engine . here",
    "we neglect this possibility .",
    "this model is a simplified version of the relativistic shock model @xcite that considers one shocked region in each side of the shock discontinuity - forward and reverse .",
    "the lack of a clear evidence for a reverse shock emission in any burst , specially during the prompt emission , means that the reverse shock in grbs is weak and the assumption of just one shocked region is a good approximation .",

    "the total power of synchrotron emission depends on the number of emitters . if only falling electrons are accelerated , the number of emitting sources are proportional to @xmath321 . in this case",
    "we have to consider a model for the evolution of the shocked region .",
    "a minimal estimation is @xmath328 where @xmath329 is a constant thickness scale .",
    "the physical reason for this choice is that in the two extreme cases when the relative lorentz factor is very large or very small , one expects a thin shocked region . in the first case",
    "the reason is that due to the large density difference between shells only a thin layer of the fast shell is affected ( shocked ) be the falling particles from slow shell . in the second case",
    "the shock is soft , the two shells merge smoothly and one expects that the size of the turbulent shocked particles be very restricted .",
    "another plausible model is the acceleration of all the electrons in the shocked region following the formation of a coherent electric field in the shock . in this case , the column density of emitters is proportional to @xmath327 , and therefore an adhoc expression for the evolution of @xmath322 is not needed .",
    "both these cases are based on the assumptions that only a detail knowledge about the micro - physics of the matter state and shock can confirm or role out .",

    "<S> the early optical emission of the moderately high redshift ( @xmath0 ) grb 060607a shows a remarkable broad and strong peak with a rapid rise and a relatively slow power - law decay . </S>",
    "<S> it is not coincident with the strong early - time flares seen in the x - ray and gamma - ray energy bands . </S>",
    "<S> there is weak evidence for variability superposed on this dominant component in several optical bands that can be related to flares in high energy bands . while for a small number of grbs </S>",
    "<S> , well - sampled optical flares have been observed simultaneously with x - ray and gamma ray pulses , grb 060607a is one of the few cases where the early optical emission shows no significant evidence for correlation with the prompt emission . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we first report in detail the broad band observations of this burst by _ </S>",
    "<S> swift_. then by applying a simple model for the dynamics and the synchrotron radiation of a relativistic shock , we show that the dominant component of the early emissions in optical wavelengths has the same origin as the tail emission produced after the main gamma ray activity . </S>",
    "<S> the most plausible explanation for the peak in the optical light curve seems to be the cooling of the prompt after the main collisions , shifting the characteristic synchrotron frequency to the optical bands . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the early emission in x - ray does not show a steep decay , like what is observed in many other grbs , is further evidence for slow cooling of the prompt shell within this grb . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that the cooling process requires a steepening of the electron energy distribution and/or a break in this distribution at high energies . from simultaneous gamma - ray emission during the first flare , the behaviour of hardness ratio , and the lack of spectral features , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the x - ray flares are due to the collision of late shells rather than late reprocessing of the central engine activities . </S>",
    "<S> the sharp break in the x - ray light curve at few thousands of seconds after the trigger , is not observed in the ir / optical / uv bands , and therefore can not be a jet break . either the x - ray break is due to a change in the spectrum of the accelerated electrons or the lack of an optical break is due to the presence of a related delayed response component .    </S>",
