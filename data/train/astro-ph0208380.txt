    "@xcite estimate that half of all disk galaxies have optical warps , and most hi disks which extend beyond the optical disks appear to be warped @xcite .",
    "a number of methods have been proposed for creating and maintaining warps .",
    "several authors @xcite have suggested that the system of discrete particles which make up the disk may have normal bending modes that could be excited . @xcite",
    "have investigated magnetic fields as a cause of warps , while @xcite and @xcite suggested that disks askew in flattened dark matter halos could develop long - lived warps , assuming the radial profile of the halo were appropriately fine - tuned .    following on the idea that infalling material will shift the angular momentum of a galaxy @xcite , @xcite studied how a disk of massive rings reacts to a slewing disk potential .",
    "they found that the reaction of the disk depends largely on its surface density , with warps appearing in regions of low surface density .",
    "also motivated by the cosmic infall of material with differing angular momentum , @xcite found that when the angular momentum of a halo and disk are misaligned , dynamical friction transfers angular momentum between them in such a way as to produce a long - lived warp .",
    "more recently , @xcite examined the torques produced by the transfer of angular momentum from gas falling onto a galactic disk , and the warping of the disk in response to these torques as well as the internal torques due to the interaction of different rings within the disk .",
    "they find a disk response which mirrors the milky way warp , though the effects of embedding the disk in a dark halo are as yet insufficiently modelled .    in a cosmological setting ,",
    "a galactic disk experiences gravitational torques from three different sources : external galaxies , non - spherically - symmetric substructure in the halo , and misalignment between the disk and halo ; if the dark matter halo is not spherical , as suggested both by simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", we evaluate the effect of the gravitational tidal torques a typical galactic disk experiences from its misalignment with the halo , and study whether these torques provide a possible origin for warped disks .",
    "we first develop a framework for how orbits in a disk react to torques .",
    "we then investigate the form and magnitude of torques due to flattened misaligned halos .",
    "the effect of these torques on massless disks is examined by analytic and numerical techniques .",
    "finally , we perform n - body simulations of massive disks resembling the milky way and investigate how the self - gravity of the disk may affect its reaction to cosmological torques .",
    "the detailed reaction of a stellar disk to a torque is derived in section  [ orbit section ] . here",
    "we introduce a simplified model to establish a framework in which the reaction of the disks to the torques can be studied , and define the terms and symbols we use .",
    "consider a star in the disk on a circular orbit in the @xmath4-plane around the origin with angular velocity @xmath5 ( see figure  [ angle diagram ] ) .",
    "we apply a torque around the @xmath6-axis by accelerating the star in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 directions around the @xmath6-axis with an antisymmetric pseudo - tensor @xmath9 .",
    "if the acceleration in the @xmath10 direction is @xmath11 and the @xmath12-position of the star is @xmath13 then the applied acceleration is@xmath14 where@xmath15 this is an angular acceleration ( or equivalently a specific torque ) around the @xmath6-axis of magnitude @xmath16 . since the angular acceleration is the time derivative of the angular velocity , the @xmath6-component of the angular velocity increases in response to the torque , and the angular momentum of the star will slew toward the @xmath6 axis , tilting the orbit toward the @xmath2-axis .      it is worth taking a minute here to elaborate on the point that the orbit tilts toward the @xmath2 axis .",
    "one might think that a torque about the @xmath2 axis would tilt the plane of the orbit _ around _ the @xmath2 axis , rather than toward it .",
    "indeed , this is what happens initially , and seems to be the thinking behind attempts to explain the milky way warp using the magellanic clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite examined the lagrangian of the system and conducted n - body experiments to demonstrate that a warp caused by the magellanic clouds would be perpendicular to the observed milky way warp .",
    "this result can be understood by examining the equations of motion of the system for a particle on a circular orbit in the @xmath1 plane about the @xmath17-axis : @xmath18 if the untorqued orbit has an angular frequency  @xmath19 , and the torque is directed around the @xmath2-axis , then the equations of motion for the three cartesian coordinates are @xmath20 the @xmath2 motion is decoupled from the other coordinates , and therefore is unaffected by the torque . by substituting equation  ( [ ydd eq ] ) into equation  ( [ zdd = -w2 z + t y ] )",
    ", the system of equations can be converted into a single fourth - order ordinary differential equation for @xmath17 of the form @xmath21 using the ansatz @xmath22 , the roots of the characteristic equation are @xmath23 the two solutions correspond to growing ( @xmath24 ) and decaying ( @xmath25 ) modes . the growing mode will dominate over time , so we neglect the decaying mode . as @xmath26 ,",
    "equations  ( [ zdd = -w2 z + t y ] ) and  ( [ freq omega ] ) yield @xmath27 for an oscillating @xmath3 , this means that the phase of @xmath3 is a quarter of an orbit ahead of @xmath17 , or that the phase of @xmath17 is a quarter of an orbit behind @xmath3 . as demonstrated in figure  [ risen orbits ] , @xmath17 reaches its maximum a quarter of an orbit after @xmath3 , causing the orbit to tilt around the @xmath3-axis toward the @xmath2-axis .    therefore , we expect that any tilting ( and therefore warping , which is a tilt that varies with radius ) will occur toward the plane perpendicular to the torque .",
    "since a torque is a transfer of angular momentum , a simple way to understand the result of @xcite is that the galactic disk acquires angular momentum with the same direction as the orbital angular momentum of the satellite , and therefore it will warp toward the plane of the satellite s orbit , not toward the satellite itself .      for an orbit in the @xmath4-plane , the angular momentum is initially aligned with the @xmath8 axis ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the torque adds angular momentum in the @xmath6 direction at a constant rate:@xmath29 if the radius of the orbit stays constant , then the angular velocity grows as@xmath30    as the torque adds angular momentum along the @xmath6 axis , the the orbit tilts toward the @xmath6 axis by an angle @xmath31 , where @xmath32 the rate of tilting at small angles is@xmath33 with a characteristic timescale to tilt one  radian of @xmath34    another motivation for this form is that @xmath35 is the angular momentum per unit mass and @xmath36 is the specific torque , which is the rate of change of the specific angular momentum .",
    "note that even for a flat rotation curve where @xmath37 , @xmath38 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath39 if @xmath40 falls off faster than @xmath41 ; i.e.  for a torque that decreases with radius , the inner regions of the disk should always tilt faster than the outer regions , resulting in a trailing warp .",
    "there is observational @xcite and theoretical @xcite evidence that dark matter halos are flattened with @xmath42 axis ratios ranging as low as 0.5 .",
    "cosmological simulations @xcite show that while the angular momentum and minor axis of a flattened halo will be correlated , there will be significant misalignments between them in a large number of halos .",
    "recent high - resolution simulations suggest that the angular momentum of the baryons may not even be aligned with that of the dark matter @xcite , and that therefore the disks that form from those baryons are usually misaligned with the minor axis of the halo matter distribution .",
    "we calculate the magnitude of the torque for a disk misaligned in a flattened halo with a radial dependence of an nfw profile @xcite but flattened along the @xmath8 axis : @xmath43 for a modified radius @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the @xmath42 axis ratio .",
    "the force from this distribution on a given point is calculated using equation ( 2 - 88 ) of @xcite . for reference",
    ", we also calculate the torques inside flattened isothermal profiles , as in equation ( 2 - 54a ) of @xcite .",
    "the torques are calculated by evaluating the forces at opposite points along a fictitious disk centered at the origin and placed at an angle @xmath31 to the @xmath4 plane ( see figure  [ angle diagram ] ) .",
    "the acceleration at radius @xmath39 due to a torque of magnitude @xmath36 is out of the plane , is of opposite sign on opposite sides of the disk , and is of magnitude @xmath46 .",
    "given the forces on two test points @xmath47 and @xmath48 at opposite sides of the disk , we take the component of the force out of the plane of the disk @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the torque is @xmath51 the angular velocity @xmath52 is determined at each point from the radial force : @xmath53 where the radial force @xmath54 is defined to be positive when it is directed toward the center of the halo .",
    "the average value of @xmath52 for the two points across the disk is used .",
    "the tilting timescale is given by equation  ( [ ttilt is omega over tau ] ) .",
    "figure  [ vary figure ] illustrates the torques derived using this method for halos with a cross - section of properties expected for galactic halos .",
    "the fiducial nfw model has flattening @xmath55 , virial velocity @xmath56 ( corresponding to @xmath57 at a galactocentric radius of 10  kpc ) , and a disk at an angle 20  to the symmetry plane of the halo .",
    "all nfw halos have concentration parameters @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the different panels show the effect of varying the disk angle by 10 , the axis ratio from 0.5   to  0.9 , and the virial velocity by 75  km  s@xmath59 compared to the fiducial model .",
    "the bottom - right panel of figure  [ vary figure ] shows the torques inside an isothermal profile with a range of axial ratios .",
    "the magnitude of the torque in the isothermal case is similar to that in the nfw case , but falls off less rapidly with radius .",
    "figure  [ vary figure ] demonstrates that the torque from a misaligned flattened halo is significant to its evolution on a cosmological timescale , as the tilting timescale @xmath38 is less then the hubble time over the entire length of the disk for all halos modelled .",
    "the torques scale approximately as the density , and therefore fall off with radius as @xmath60 with @xmath61 ranging from @xmath62 at small radii to @xmath63 at large radii for nfw halos and equal to @xmath64 for isothermal halos .",
    "the typical torque follows the relation@xmath65 the angular velocity @xmath66 where @xmath67 ranges from @xmath68 to @xmath64 in nfw halos , and is @xmath62 in isothermal halos .",
    "the tilting timescale @xmath38 , as calculated using equation  ( [ ttilt is omega over tau ] ) , rises almost linearly with radius ; the timescale is shorter in the inner regions of the disk , and therefore the inner disk tilts faster than the outer disk in response to torques from misaligned halos .",
    "for example , in an isothermal halo @xmath69 while @xmath70 so @xmath71 . the torque increases more rapidly toward the center than does the disk s ability to resist the torque due to its angular momentum .",
    "the further the halos and disks are misaligned , the stronger the torque is ; however , the torque profile is mostly unchanged for angles beyond 20 . increasing the virial velocity , and",
    "therefore the mass of the halo , increases the magnitude of the torque . because the concentration @xmath72 is held constant amongst these models , changing the virial velocity also changes the scale radius @xmath73 , which can be seen in the shifting of the radius of the knee in the profiles of the top - right panel of figure  [ vary figure ] .",
    "the flattening of the halo has a large effect on the magnitude of the torque , with torques strengthening as the halo departs further from spherical symmetry .",
    "the torques fall off more slowly in the isothermal halos than in the nfw halos , but are of similar magnitude over most of the disk radius .",
    "the results of section  [ const radius orbit ] assume that the torque does not change the radius of the orbit .",
    "this is a poor approximation , since the torque does work on the star whenever the torque is not orthogonal to the orbital angular momentum . in this section",
    "we do a more thorough analysis , taking into account the changing radius of the orbit .",
    "we define @xmath31 as in section  [ const radius orbit ] , and @xmath74 as the azimuthal angle around the orbit ( see figure  [ angle diagram ] ) . based on the results of section  [ idealized torques ] , the torque can be expressed as a power law:@xmath75 which exerts a force@xmath76    this force torques the orbit and alters the angular momentum @xmath77 . if the orbit can be considered to be a circular orbit with circular velocity @xmath78 ( where the radial dependence is a function of the underlying potential ) , then    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the unit vector in the direction perpendicular to the orbit .",

    "comparison of equations  ( [ timescale is half omega over tau ] ) and  ( [ ttilt is omega over tau ] ) reveals that the main effect of allowing a second degree of freedom , by permitting @xmath97 to vary , is to increase the tilting timescale by a factor of two .",
    "this factor is also evident from a comparison of the dashed and the solid line in figure  4 .",

    "we perform a simulation of a disk of 16000  massless tracer particles placed in 800  concentric rings at radii spaced 0.05  kpc apart , each containing 20  particles .",
    "they are evolved for 1  gyr using a predictor - corrector code under the influence of an nfw potential ( @xmath58 , @xmath98 ) and a torquing force of the form  ( [ tau = 1e-30 r-2.5 ] ) .",
    "we cap the torque at @xmath99 inside @xmath100 in order to prevent extremely small timesteps for particles near the center where the torquing force diverges .",
    "the particles were then binned into spherical shells 3  kpc wide .",
    "we calculated the moment of inertia tensor @xmath101 for the particles within each shell and diagonalized it to find the direction of the minor axis ( the axis with the smallest moment of inertia ) .",
    "the minor axis was found to be tilted toward the @xmath6-axis by an angle @xmath31 that varied from bin to bin .",
    "we also evolved the coupled set of differential equations  ( [ dr / dt coupled ] ) and  ( [ dth / dt coupled ] ) forward 1  gyr with the same values of @xmath61 and @xmath102 as above using a fourth - order runge - kutta integrator for a set of initial conditions @xmath103 , @xmath104 representing an initially flat disk .",
    "figure  [ plot massless theta(r , t ) ] compares the simulation ( filled diamonds ) with the numerical solution to equations  ( [ dr / dt coupled ] ) and  ( [ dth / dt coupled ] ) ( open squares ) , the simplified model  ( [ simple theta(t ) ] ) ( dashed line ) , and the detailed analytic prediction  ( [ analytic better theta(r , t ) ] ) ( solid line ) .",
    "it is apparent that at most radii , ( [ analytic better theta(r , t ) ] ) is a good approximation to the simulation  much better than  ( [ simple theta(t ) ] ) , demonstrating the importance of including the radial drift of the orbits . at small tilt angles ,",
    "the difference between the solid line  ( [ analytic better theta(r , t ) ] ) and the dashed line  ( [ simple theta(t ) ] ) is exactly the factor of  two due to the extra degree of freedom derived in section  [ factor of 2 derivation ] . at small radii ( @xmath105 ) ,",
    "the solutions diverge : the numerical solution contains rings of the same radius but different tilts while the simulation bins the particles by radius and therefore averages particles in the same shell together ; more importantly , the assumption that @xmath91 is small is violated .",
    "however , in the innermost region of a halo the symmetric bulge will dominate the potential , and therefore the torque power law is likely invalid in any case .",
    "for these reasons , we ignore the innermost 2  kpc in our analysis and consider equation  ( [ analytic better theta(r , t ) ] ) to be a good description of the disk everywhere else .",
    "figure  [ plot massless theta(r , t ) ] suggests that disks should have continuously curved warps in their inner regions , eventually becoming flat in the outer regions where @xmath38 is small .",
    "real warped galaxies appear quite the opposite ; they are solid out to approximately the holmberg radius ( half of the diameter of the @xmath106 isophote ) and warped beyond that @xcite .",
    "the most important difference between real galactic disks and those used in section  [ orbit section ] is that the self - gravity of real galactic disks is important ; galaxies have mass .",
    "although the dark matter halo must dominate the potentials of disk galaxies at large radii , there is considerable evidence that the self - gravity of the disk is important to its dynamics over much of its area .",
    "@xcite show that `` maximal disk '' models , where the mass - to - light ratios of the disks @xmath107 are as large as is consistent with the rotation curves , provide good fits to most rotation curves .",
    "@xcite demonstrates that the milky way is also consistent with having a maximal disk .",
    "although @xcite have used the residuals of the tully - fisher relation @xcite to estimate that disks provide only 40% of the dynamical mass at 2.2 exponential scale lengths , and @xcite have demonstrated that the rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies imply that they are substantially sub - maximal , the prevalent phenomena of spiral arms and bars , which are disk instabilities , require that in many disks , the self - gravity of the disk must be important to its dynamics @xcite .    the self - gravity of the disk acts to keep the disk flat .",
    "@xcite examined the effect of a slewing disk potential on a set of self - gravitating rings and found that regions of high surface density react like a solid body .",
    "since the surface density of the disk is highest in the central regions , the central parts of the disk will be kept locally flat , resulting in disks that closer resemble observed warped galaxies .",
    "using numerical n - body simulations , we investigate this effect .",
    "@xcite take this into account by developing a form for the internal torque @xmath108 .",
    "here we do not use their @xmath108 , but rather integrate the orbits numerically . while this does not provide us with an explicit set of differential equations for @xmath109",
    ", it frees us from such assumptions as the constancy of @xmath110 ( which we saw was important in section  [ massless disk full derivation ] ) , the existence of an equilibrium configuration , and the lack of a dark matter halo .      to evaluate how the mass of the disk affects the results of section  [ orbit section ] , we performed numerical n - body simulations of massive milky way type galactic disks . equilibrium disk models of disk mass @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , scale length @xmath114 and vertical scale height @xmath115 in a static spherically - symmetric nfw halo potential @xcite with concentration parameter @xmath58 and virial velocity @xmath116 were constructed using the method of @xcite and then allowed to relax under the force of gravity until they appeared to be in equilibrium .",
    "the halo masses were varied such that the mass of the disk plus halo was @xmath117 in each case .",
    "the models were evolved using the grapesph code @xcite , where interparticle gravitational forces are computed using direct summation with grape-3 hardware @xcite .",
    "a plummer softening of 0.3  kpc has been used .",
    "the models were evolved for 2  gyr , which took 5000 - 7000 timesteps depending on the model .",

    "the main plane of the disk is flat and clearly tilted toward the positive @xmath6-axis , as expected from section  [ direction of tilt ] . beyond 10  kpc , the disk no longer remains flat but warps back toward the original plane . the particles which appear to be filling in the area between the main disk and the warp are projections and are actually in front of or behind the galaxy at large radii .",
    "we binned the simulation particles into spherical shells of thickness 2  kpc and calculated their tilts as in section  [ analytic vs simulations ] .",
    "figure  [ plot tilt vs r selfgravity ] shows a plot of the radial profile of the disk shown in figure  [ simulation disk ] , along with the massless simulation and analytic prediction  ( [ analytic better theta(r , t ) ] ) from figure  [ plot massless theta(r , t ) ] , which correspond to a massless disk in the same torque .",
    "there are three important regimes : the central flat disk , the warp , and the effectively massless outer region .",
    "the central 11  kpc is all tilted @xmath125 from the original plane ( we ignore the innermost point because the torque is capped inside @xmath126 ) , and corresponds to the visually flat part of the disk .",

    "finally , from 17  kpc to 23  kpc ( the extent of the disk ) , it follows the analytic prediction , acting like a massless disk .",
    "this result agrees qualitatively with that of @xcite , who found that regions of high surface density remain flat when torqued , and the position of a warp is determined in part by a drop in surface density .",
    "we now investigate how the disk evolves over time under the influence of the torque .",
    "the general form of the warp is as above , but as the disk evolves under the influence of the torque , the warp radius moves out through the disk at a rate that depends on the mass of the disk . at early times , typically before 200  myr , the solid region is not well developed and lies below the massless prediction .",
    "we developed an algorithm to automatically detect the warp radius .",
    "the particle positions were stored every 40 timesteps . for each of these outputs ,",
    "the tilt angles were calculated in spherical shells as in figure  [ plot tilt vs r selfgravity ] .",
    "we did a bootstrap analysis to estimate the error in these angles : for each spherical shell , we drew 10 random sets from the particles in that shell , calculated the tilt of each bootstrap set , and then used the standard deviation of those angles as an estimate of the error in the tilt of that bin .",
    "the error depended on the number of particles in the shell , but was typically less than 1 .    shells with errors greater than 0.5",
    "were not analyzed , as these generally had few particles and were dominated by numerical noise . for each remaining shell with radius @xmath39 and tilt @xmath128 , we calculated the deviation @xmath129 between the simulation tilt @xmath128 and the analytic prediction @xmath130 from equation  ( [ analytic better theta(r , t ) ] ) .",
    "the average radius @xmath39 of the radial bin with the highest @xmath129 was then considered to be the warp radius @xmath127 .",
    "this is the radius at which the difference between the tilt of the massive disk and the tilt of an equivalent massless disk is maximized .",
    "for example , in figure  [ plot tilt vs r selfgravity ] , the highest @xmath129 occurs at @xmath131 where the data point @xmath132 and the predicted line @xmath133 .",
    "this corresponds exactly to the radial bin at the end of the plateau in figure  [ plot tilt vs r selfgravity ] .",
    "examining a few randomly chosen outputs from each simulation showed that in each case this automated @xmath127 agreed with our intuition , except at early times when there was no solid disk and the automated @xmath127 was dominated by noise .",
    "figures  [ rw2.0 figure ] , [ rw2.5 figure ] ,  and [ rw3.0 figure ] show the evolution of this warp radius for the set of simulations with differing torque slopes @xmath134 .",
    "the squares , circles , and triangles correspond to simulations with disk masses of 1 , 3 ,  and @xmath135 respectively .",
    "the warp radii appear `` quantized '' because of the 2  kpc - wide radial bins used to calculate the tilt ( see , e.g.  figure  [ plot tilt vs r selfgravity ] ) . one point was taken every @xmath136 years , linearly interpolating @xmath137 from the neighbouring simulation outputs .",
    "the early times before the warp has developed show up as noise in the upper - left region of some of the figures , particularly figure  [ rw3.0 figure ] . to quantify the growth of the warp",
    ", straight lines were fit through the profiles . while one might think that the lines ought to be constrained to pass through the origin , since there is no warp at @xmath138",
    ", the data do not support this because the warp instability requires that the surface density of the disk be below a certain critical surface density , as we demonstrate later .",
    "we examined figures  [ rw2.0 figure][rw3.0 figure ] by eye and excluded the obviously noisy early times from the fits ; in practice , this meant excluding @xmath139 yr for the @xmath140 , @xmath141 simulation and @xmath142 yr for the @xmath140 , @xmath143 simulation .",
    "we ended the simulations after 2  gyr , the time when solid region reached the edge of the particle disk in some simulations , at which point the algorithm to find @xmath127 just detects the edge of the disk .",
    "the fits are shown as the solid , dashed , and dotted lines for the simulations with disk masses of 1 , 3 ,  and @xmath135 respectively .",
    "the slope of the linear fit measures how quickly the warp grows .",
    "this could depend both on the mass of the disk , which affects the local surface density at the warp radius , and the slope of the torque , which determines the strength of the torque at the warp radius .",
    "figure  [ warp growth ] shows the rate that @xmath127 grows for each simulation .",
    "there is an apparent trend that the warps in higher mass disks move through the disk faster than in lower mass disks , but the scaling does not appear simple .",
    "there is some indication from figure  [ warp growth ] that the warps from shallower torque laws ( which have stronger torques at the warp radii ) grow faster than those with steep torques , but the situation is not clear .",
    "the effect of the disk mass on the rate of the warp growth implies that the self - gravity of the disk is important to the formation of the warp . in a massive disk , particles at different radii",
    "are coupled to each other gravitationally and act to keep the disk locally flat .",
    "this suggests that the crucial factor that determines where the warp develops is the local surface density of the disk .",
    "@xcite examined the effect of a slewing disk potential on a set of self - gravitating rings and found qualitatively that regions of high surface density react like a solid body , but that warps can occur where the surface density is lower .",
    "@xcite noted that in most cases the group speed of bending waves in a disk of surface density @xmath144 and angular rotation velocity @xmath88 is@xmath145 and therefore the time for a warp to settle at a given radius would be inversely proportional to the surface density at that radius .    to test this , we translate the warp radii of the simulations into local surface densities using @xmath146 for a disk of mass @xmath147 and exponential scale length @xmath148 . figure  [ plot surface density ] shows the surface density at the warp radius as a function of time for the three disks of different mass in a @xmath149 torque ( i.e. for the same simulations shown in figure  [ rw2.5 figure ] ) , while figure  [ plot sigma beta ] shows it for a @xmath150 disk in torques with varying @xmath134 .",
    "the surface density at the warp radius falls as the warp moves out through the disk .",
    "the local surface densities at the warp _ at a given time _ are quite similar for all disk masses , and have even smaller scatter for different torque laws .",
    "it appears that the local surface density is the important parameter for determining the warp radius at a given time .",
    "the evolution of the warp is well described by a decaying exponential @xmath151 with @xmath152 and @xmath153 myr , shown as the straight line in figures  [ plot surface density ] and  [ plot sigma beta ] .",
    "for such a result to hold , the timescale @xmath154 should depend only on global properties of the galaxy independent of disk mass or torque ; in particular , it can only depend on @xmath155 , the virial velocity of the galaxy @xmath116 , the exponential scale length of the disk @xmath156 , and/or the vertical scale height @xmath157 .",
    "an interesting timescale that matches this is the characteristic timescale for bending waves @xcite one disk scale length away from @xmath155 : @xmath158 which is 490  myr in these cases .",
    "@xmath155 is the extrapolation of equation  ( [ sigma warp(t ) ] ) to @xmath138 , and is the critical surface density above which the disk does not develop a warp . at higher surface densities ,",
    "the self - gravity of the disk is always sufficient to keep the disk flat .",
    "it is interesting that the extrapolation to @xmath138 , when there is no torque , gives a finite well - defined value for the warp surface density .",
    "this is why the linear @xmath159 fits do not go through the origin and suggests that at this surface density the disk is marginally unstable to warping .",
    "we do not expect to see warps occurring at surface densities higher than @xmath160 . in the milky way",
    ", the warp begins at or slightly beyond the solar circle @xcite , while recent hipparcos determinations of the milky way surface density in the solar neighbourhood give @xmath161 @xcite .",
    "it is encouraging that this is less than @xmath155 . in external galaxies ,",
    "warps begin between 25  and 26.5  mag arcsec@xmath162 @xcite , which for a mass to light ratio in @xmath163 of @xmath164 gives surface densities of between 1.87.0 @xmath165 , ignoring projection effects and extinction .",
    "this is also consistent with a picture in which warps only can occur at surface densities below @xmath155 .",
    "we studied how a typical galactic disk reacts to torques expected from lying in misaligned dark matter halos .",
    "our main findings are the following :    * cosmological n - body simulations suggest that galactic disks will be misaligned with the mass distribution of the dark matter halo in which they are embedded .",
    "because of this misalignment , the halo exerts a perpendicular gravitational torque on the disk of the form@xmath166 with typical values of @xmath167 and @xmath124 . this gravitational torque is strong enough to have a significant effect on the entire disk within a hubble time .",
    "* the timescale for an orbit to tilt in response to this torque rises with radius , so inner portions of the disk will realign themselves first , resulting in a warped disk .",
    "for a massless disk of stars in circular orbits , a good estimate of how tilted the disk is at a radius @xmath39 after a time @xmath168 is@xmath169\\ ] ] where the timescale @xmath170 is defined as @xmath171 and is twice as long as in the case where the orbital radii are not allowed to vary .",
    "* massive disks depart from this due to the self - gravity of the inner portions of the disk .",
    "the disk is kept flatter where the local surface density is high than for a massless disk .",
    "the radius inside which the disk is flat ( which corresponds to the radius where the warp would be considered to start if the disk were observed ) grows with time .",
    "the warp grows at a rate of between 3  and 10  kpc  gyr@xmath59 .",
    "the rate depends on the mass of the disk , but is relatively insensitive to the torque parameters . *",
    "more massive disks have faster - growing warps , since only at large radius is the surface density sufficiently low that its self - gravity can not maintain the flat disk . the surface density at which the warp occurs is well - described by @xmath172 where @xmath152 and @xmath153  myr , independent of disk mass and torque slope .",
    "@xmath155 is the maximum surface density at which a warp can occur , and marks the point where a disk is marginally unstable to warping .",
    "@xmath154 appears to coincide with the timescale of bending waves one disk scale length away from @xmath155 : @xmath173    in the future , we plan to analyze high resolution cosmological simulations to determine the torques due to realistic dark matter halos .",
    "this will enable us to distinguish the torque due to the misaligned disk , that due to substructure in the halo , and that due to the external tidal field by modeling individual halos .",
    "a further direction that we have not yet explored is sampling cosmological simulations at regular intervals up to the present day to replace the static torque force used in this work with a torquing field that changes over time in a cosmologically - motivated manner .",
