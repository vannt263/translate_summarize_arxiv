    "luminous infrared galaxies , which emit a substantial amount of their bolometric luminosities in the wavelength range 81000 @xmath12 m ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; see sanders & mirabel 1996 for a review ) , are observed to be in a phase of dynamically triggered evolution .",
    "ground - based optical to near - infrared imaging of the most powerful galaxies detected in the iras survey ( @xcite ) have revealed that virtually all show evidence of a strong interaction ( eg . extended tidal tails ) or double nuclei ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "extensive optical and near infrared spectroscopic surveys have shown that these galaxies can be classified as luminous starbursts and active galactic nuclei , agn ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 1998 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , both of which are presumably fueled by the abundance of molecular gas ( @xcite ; @xcite ) that collect via gravitational torques and dissipate into the merging nuclei ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "most of the direct ultraviolet and optical light emitted by these starbursts and agn is obscured by the interstellar dust of the merging galaxy , but is re - emitted at far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "evidence of morphological disturbances ( e.g. mackenty & stockton 1984 ) and large amounts of molecular gas ( e.g. sanders , scoville , & soifer 1988 ) and dust in a few optically - selected qsos , combined with the similarities in the space densities of qsos and uligs ( @xcite ) , initially led to the hypothesis that uligs might evolve into optically - selected qsos , once most of their gas and dust are consumed / blown out by star formation and agn activity ( @xcite ) . during this process",
    "an accompanying evolution in the far - infrared color , from cold , starburst - like colors to warm , seyfert - like colors , takes place ( @xcite ) .",
    "the scenario is supported by optical and mid - infrared spectroscopy , which shows an increasing fraction of agn - like emission - line spectra in uligs as a function of increasing luminosity ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "while the nature of the luminous infrared galaxies are believed to be understood in general terms , the details have been under investigation for over a decade .",
    "however , the wealth of ground - based spectroscopic and low resolution imaging surveys have provided little information on the circumnuclear region at scales comparable to the dimensions of the starbursts and/or agn believed to be responsible for the bulk of their bolometric luminosities .",
    "optical imaging of these galaxies has been obtained with hubble space telescope ( hst ) with resolutions @xmath15 ; however , at these wavelengths the circumnuclear regions are still obscured by the high dust column densities .",
    "the recent installation of the near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) on hst has now made it possible to observe more directly the embedded nuclear regions by providing the high resolution possible with hst ( 0.10.2@xmath10 , which corresponds to 30 - 200 pc over the redshift range 0.010.1 ) at wavelengths where the effects of dust extinction are reduced by an order of magnitude ( in exponential optical depth ) compared to visual wavelengths .",
    "we present here an investigation of the near - infrared morphologies of 24 luminous infrared galaxies using the new capabilities of hst .",
    "the analyses and conclusions drawn from this study benefit from previous ground - based imaging and spectroscopy of these galaxies .",
    "this paper is divided into eight sections .",
    "section 1 concludes with a discussion of the general objectives of the survey and the sample selection . in  2 , the observations , data reduction , and flux calibration are summarized .",
    "included here is a description of the point spread function ( psf ) subtraction performed on the brighter , unresolved nuclei and the extinction corrections applied to the 2.2 @xmath12 m images .",
    "the morphologies of the individual galaxies are summarized in  3 and  4 , followed by a discussion of the aperture colors and their intepretation in  5 .",
    "section 6 contains a discussion of the radial profile fits to the images and how well they are fit by elliptical galaxy and exponential disk profiles . in  7 , the degree of central compactness",
    "is discussed , and in  8 the nature of the extended near - infrared light is considered .",
    "section 9 is a summary of the paper . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt h@xmath16=75 mpc@xmath17 and q@xmath18 ; at the typical redshift ( z=0.05 ) of the observed galaxies , 0.10.2  resolution corresponds to 100200 pc .",
    "the nicmos images are particularly well - suited to defining the small - scale structure of the dust embedded galactic nuclei in infrared luminous galaxies .",
    "the 1.1 , 1.6 , and 2.2 @xmath12 m measurements can be used to determine the distribution of dust extinction ( assuming intrinsic colors of the embedded stellar populations ) and the observed light distribution corrected for this extinction to better estimate the ` true ' light distribution .",
    "the issues we address here include :    \\1 ) the location and size of the galactic nucleus ( or nuclei )  an unresolved resolved nucleus ( i.e. @xmath19 ) might indicate an agn or compact , super - luminous starburst  and whether the fraction of the total 2.2 @xmath12 m light emitted from compact nuclear sources is correlated with the total bolometric luminosity or the optical emission line spectral classification and far - infrared color .",
    "\\2 ) the morphology of the dust extinction in the galactic nuclei as an indication of central dust accretion disks or rings    \\3 ) the existence of inner spirals or bars both of which could transport material to the nucleus and stimulate starbursts in the inner disk    \\4 ) the properties and distribution of luminous ( presumably young ) star clusters formed in the galactic disks and nuclear regions    \\5 ) the stellar surface brightness profiles and their relationship to the stage of dynamical evolution of the galaxies      the sample of galaxies range in infrared luminosities from 10@xmath20 to 4 x 10@xmath21  at @xmath22=8 - 1000 @xmath12 m .",

    "the majority of the galaxies were taken from the iras bright galaxy survey which includes all extragalactic objects ( 324 galaxies ) brighter than 5.4 jy at 60 @xmath12 m at @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( @xcite ) . since one of the primary objectives of this study",
    "was to look for morphological similarities between the ultraluminous infrared galaxies , agns and nuclear starbursts , we have included for reference two optically - selected qsos which are also warm ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( 3c48 and mrk 1014 ) and the relatively nearby starburst galaxy ngc 6090 .",
    "we then selected a large fraction of the most luminous systems , the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ) which have l@xmath25  at @xmath22=8 - 1000 @xmath12 m .",
    "nine of the ten galaxies in the original list of uligs ( @xcite ) are included here ; the remaining object ( mrk 231 ) was imaged in a companion study by hines et al .",
    "we also include here 5 of the 12 objects contained in the warm ultraluminous sample ( @xcite ) ; these were not in the bgs due to their lower 60 @xmath12 m flux . as stated in the introduction , the warm uligs",
    "have been suggested as a transition class between the cold uligs and optical / uv excess qsos .",

    "observations of both the galaxies and the psf stars were done using a four or five - point spiral dither in each filter setting ; the step size in most cases was 25.5 pixels ( 1.91@xmath10 ) . the dithered observing mode yields better sampling of the psf ( due to the half - pixel steps ) and the ability to identify bad - pixels , pixels temporarily affected by cosmic rays , and processing artifacts . at each dither position ,",
    "non - destructive reads ( multiaccum ) were taken .",
    "the total integration times for each filter are listed in table 2 .",
    "dark images were obtained at the end of each orbit .",
    "the initial data reduction and calibration was done with iraf .",
    "the dark was first created , then the nicmos data were dark subtracted , flatfielded and corrected for cosmic rays using the iraf pipeline reduction routine calnica ( bushouse 1997 ) .",
    "the calibrated images contained pixels with reduced quantum efficiency due to contaminants on the array surface , thus a mask was created to minimized their effect .",
    "two additional areas required masking ; the coronographic hole was masked on all images , as well as column 128 , which is noteably sensitive to minute discrepancies in dark subtraction ( i.e. , the dark current rises sharply toward the center column of the array ) .",
    "the dithered images were then shifted and averaged using the drizzle routine in iraf ( e.g. hook & fruchter 1997 ) .",
    "the plate scales of the final `` drizzled '' images are 0.0381@xmath10 and 0.0378@xmath10 per pixel in @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the reduced images are shown as 3-color images in fig .",
    "[ 3color ] .",
    "because of the very large dynamic range and signal - to - noise ratio in the surface brightness of the galaxies , a variable resolution smoothing routine ( see appendix a ) was applied to the image data for the contour maps ( fig .",

    "this routine smooths the image with a variable width boxcar filter with the resolution depending on the local signal - to - noise ratio across the image .    for each galaxy ,",
    "the three broad - band images were obtained during a single guide star acquisition within one orbit . since the stability of the guide star tracking for all of these nicmos observations is much better than a single pixel , the relative registration of the three images was assured .",
    "on the other hand , in no instance did we attempt absolute registration of the images using multiple guide stars .",
    "we therefore adopt coordinates in each galaxy measured as offsets from the 2.2 @xmath12 m peak , using the same pixel origin for the 1.1 and 1.6 @xmath12 m images .",

    ", we compared our measured fluxes within a 5  aperture centered on the 1.6@xmath12 m and 2.22@xmath12 m peaks in each galaxy with those measured in ground - based imaging by carico et al .",
    "for the 16 galaxies which overlap between the two samples , the flux densities of all but one ( ir 12112 + 0305 ) agree to better than 10% . at 1.1@xmath12 m",

    "the images are contaminated by diffraction rings and spikes due to strong point sources in the galactic nuclei .",

    "the nuclear point sources were subtracted with psf stars . given the variability of the hst psf caused by telescope breathing , this removal of the psf is only approximate .",
    "to avoid spurious psf artifacts being interpreted as real structure in the images , we therefore set the surface brightness within a box centered on the point source to a constant value equal to the average of the flux along the outside border of the box .",

    "none of the 3-color images displayed in figure 2 have any psf subtraction .    due to the higher resolutions in the two shorter wavelength bands and our desire to show the original , unconvolved ( but calibrated ) data for the 3-color images , these images occasionally exhibit ` color fringes ' in areas with steep brightness gradients ( eg . near a bright point source ) .",
    "the alternatives ( convolving all wavelengths to a common 2.2 @xmath12 m resolution or deconvolving to the 1.1 @xmath12 m resolution ) would have degraded the short wavelength resolution or been susceptible to artifacts of the deconvolution technique .",
    "therefore , the color - fringes appearing in areas with steep intensity gradients in the 3-color displays should be viewed with caution and in most cases ignored .      in most of the galaxies , large spatial variations in the colors of the near - infrared emission",
    "are seen across the images . aside from the nuclear point sources ( which may have different intrinsic colors )",
    ", most of the large - scale color gradients are probably attributable to variations in the dust extinction within the galaxy .",
    "this implicitly assumes that outside the nucleus there is little contribution to the flux from warm dust and that the galactic disk stellar light in the near infrared is mostly that of a @xmath36 yrs stellar population rather than that of the old disk population ( age @xmath37 yrs ) .",
    "we thus correct the 2.2 @xmath12 m images for extinction under the assumption that the intrinsic spectrum of the extended emission is that of an aging starburst population with the extinction derived from the observed @xmath9 @xmath12 m color . for the intrinsic colors",
    ", we use the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 , 95 ) model starburst population having a salpeter imf ( see below ) over the mass range 0.1 - 125  . for an instantaneous starburst with solar metallicity",

    "thus , the 1.6 - 2.2 @xmath12 m color excess is given by    @xmath41    to translate the color excess into an extinction we assume that the extinction is in a foreground screen ( i.e. not mixed with the stars ) and use the extinction law derived by rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) that has been modified at the shorter wavelengths .",

    "in viewing these extinction - corrected images , the reader should bear in mind the two assumptions which are certainly not always correct : that the dust providing the extinction lies in front of the emission sources ( i.e. is not mixed with the stars ) and that the intrinsic ( unextincted ) color is uniform and approximated by that of a moderate age starburst population .",
    "the former is probably the most flawed of these assumptions .",
    "when the dust is mixed uniformly with the radiation sources , the observations typically sample the first few optical depths at each wavelength . for actual @xmath52 in the range 1 to 10 with the dust uniformly mixed with the stars ,",
    "the true optical depth is underestimated typically by a factor @xmath53 but for larger @xmath54 the underestimate can be much greater ( see fig .  [ nucflux ] and @xcite ) .",
    "the emission will also appear bluer than would be expected for the same total extinction .",
    "an additional problem arises from the intrinsically higher angular resolution at 1.6 @xmath12 m than at 2.2 @xmath12 m . despite the reservations and assumptions noted above , these extinction corrected images probably yield a more generally accurate rendition of the intrinsic 2.2 @xmath12 m emission than the observed 2.2 @xmath12 m images .",
    "evidence of this is provided in the case of arp 220 where the de - extincted image yields peaks which better fit the pa of the radio nuclei ( scoville et al .",
    "morphological characteristics occuring in many of the images of the 24 galaxies include : double nuclei , extended ` tidal ' tails , point source nuclei ( particularly at 2.2 @xmath12 m in the most luminous and distant objects ) , bright off - nuclei star clusters , spiral arms ( on the scale of 100 pc to 1 kpc ) , and high reddening in the nuclei .",

    "we show the @xmath97 m logarithmic surface brightness profile for each galaxy as a linear function of radius in fig .",
    "[ radial_kpc ] . here , a straight line fit would suggest a spiral - like stellar profile .",
    "similarly , we show the @xmath97 m logarithmic surface brightness for each system as a function of r@xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ radial_r1_4 ] .",
    "an r@xmath13 law profile will appear as a straight line in this figure . to evaluate quantitatively the r@xmath13-law and exponential - disk models , minimum @xmath98 fitting of both models to the observational data",
    "was done and table 8 summarizes the results .",
    "the radial range for the fitting was between 0.22  radius and the outer limit of detectable emission ( typically a factor of 30 in radius ) .",
    "all model fitting was performed on the 1.6 @xmath12 m data ( as opposed to the @xmath6 m data ) in order to take advantage of the greater sensitivity of nicmos at @xmath97 m .",
    "( because the @xmath6 m fluxes are less reliable in the faint , outer regions of the galaxies , we also did not use the extinction - corrected surface brightness . )    in 9 of 24 galaxies , the light profiles at 1.6 @xmath12 m are fit better , ( in the sense that the ratio of the @xmath98 from the two fits is greater than three ) by an r@xmath13-law than by an exponential disk profile .",
    "these galaxies are ngc 4418 , zw049.057 , ngc 2623 , ic883 ,",
    "ngc 6240 , ugc 5101 , iras 10565 + 2448 , arp 220 , iras 14348 - 1447 .",
    "several of these galaxies have been recognized in previous work as exhibiting an r@xmath13 law : ngc 2623 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , ic883 ( @xcite ) , and arp 220 ( @xcite ) and the scale lengths derived here ( see table 8) are similar to those derived previously by these authors . in the case of ngc 2623 , the exponential disk form becomes acceptable if the nucleus is excluded .",
    "it is important to note , that the majority of the systems studied here ( 13 of 24 ) could be fit equally well by either an r@xmath13-law or an exponential profile over the radii we are exploring with nicmos . in only in one case , vv114e , was an exponential fit significantly better than an r@xmath13-law fit .",
    "we also find that 8 of the 9 galaxies fit well by the r@xmath13-law have cool iras colors ( or equivalently have hii - like optical emission lines ) while only one is warm .",
    "this correlation might arise since the cool uligs have more extended far infrared emission from an extended starburst population .",
    "the young stars , formed in a dynamically relaxed merger , eventually evolve to become bright in the near - infrared  possibly resulting in an r@xmath13-law near - infrared light distribution .",
    "our admittedly small statistics seem to indicate for those uligs and ligs where a clear preference is shown for one type of fit over the other , this is usually an r@xmath13-law profile .",
    "since our measurements cover a large range in radii for each source , and extend well beyond a typical spiral bulge radius in nearly all cases , this result is not simply stating the obvious fact that merging spiral galaxies have elliptical - like bulges .",
    "instead , it suggests that the stellar population whose light dominates the inner @xmath99 kpc in these galaxies appears to be better approximated by a spheroidal as opposed to a disk - like orbital configuration . if the near  infrared light is dominated by young stars such as red supergiants , these stars must have formed during the merger and have already assumed elliptical - like orbits . whether these systems end up forming giant ellipticals",
    "will depend on a number of factors  most importantly , the overall mass density of stars in the central regions and the quantity of ism left over in a cold disk after the merging is complete .",
    "kormendy & sanders ( 1992 ) have pointed out that in some of the ultra - luminous sytems ( eg .",
    "arp 220 ) , the central mass density is in fact similar to the of elliptical galaxy cores if the massive ism component is included ",
    "the presumption is then that an elliptical galaxy could be the end product if a significant fraction of the ism is converted into stars .",
    "however , these are extreme examples and it seems more likely that the lower luminousity infrared , merging galaxies will end up as spirals with massive central bulges .",
    "the change in color and/or the degree of compactness in the light distribution of a galaxy can provide important clues as to the dominant energy source . an active galaxy ( seyfert or quasar )",
    "can emit a significant fraction of its energy at all wavelengths on very small scales ( tens of pc or smaller ) , whereas this is impossible for a starburst .",
    "the more luminous a system is , the harder it is to pack the requisite number of young stars and supernovae into a small enough volume without disrupting the starburst completely via the action of stellar and supernovae - driven winds .",
    "although star formation in luminous infrared galaxies is believed to occur over relatively small ( as compared to an entire galaxy ) scales , sizes of a few hundred parsecs to a few kpc have been measured from co and emission  line gas observations .",
    "since most of the energy in luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies emerges in the mid and far  infrared , this is the logical part of the spectrum from which to judge the size of the power source .",
    "a number of authors have presented mid  infrared images or estimates of the compactness at @xmath100 m in some of the nearest ligs and uligs with beams ranging from @xmath101 ( becklin & wynn - williams 1987 ; matthews et al .",
    "1987 ; carico et al . 1988 ; sanders et al . 1988a , etc . ) and have found a strong trend toward increasing compactness for systems with luminosities above @xmath102l@xmath103 .",
    "however , since the nearest ulig ( arp 220 ) has a scale approaching 300pc/@xmath10 , these observations , with the exception of the drift  scan measurement of mrk 231 by matthews et al .",
    "( 1987 ) which did place an upper limit of 0.5@xmath10 fwhm on the size of the emitting region in mrk 231 , could not rule out dense , luminous starbursts as the source of the enormous energies .    in the near  infrared",
    ", we are measuring starlight , hot dust , and/or non - thermal emission from a central active nucleus .",
    "therefore we may not be directly probing the material responsible for the far  infrared emission in ligs or uligs .",
    "however , the sharp and relatively stable psf provided by nicmos can be used to place a limit on the maximum amount of unresolved near  infrared light coming from the nucleus in each of our sample galaxies , and allow us to measure the compactness of these sources on scales often well below 100 pc .",
    "if a significant fraction of the total near  infrared light is unresolved at nicmos resolution , it may provide strong evidence for an active nucleus .    in this section ,",
    "we quantify the degree of central concentration of the light in the luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies in order to investigate trends in the nuclear contribution as a function of luminosity , merger evolutionary stage and nuclear characteristics . to accomplish this , in a manner which is relatively independent of distance effects , we compute the total flux with 3 kpc projected radius of the 2.2 @xmath12 m peak and then calculate the percentage of this flux contained as a function of radii less than 3 kpc ( fig .",
    "[ f_radial_kpc ] ) .",
    "these curves of growth can then be used to assess the contribution of a compact source ( i.e. , a puatative agn ) to the total flux .",
    "the vertical bar on the top border indicates an angular _ radius _ of 0.12 , corresponding to the radius ( hwhm ) of the diffraction resolution at 2.2 @xmath12 m .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ f_radial_kpc ] reveals that seven of the galaxies have a significant percentage ( @xmath104% ) of their flux originating within @xmath105 radius : ngc 7469 , iras 08572 + 3915 , iras 05189 - 2524 , pks1345 + 12 , iras 07598 + 6508 , mrk 1014 , and 3c48 ( not shown here ) .",
    "all of the seven galaxies with significant nuclear point - source contributions are also classified as warm in terms of their mid - infrared colors , yet there are warm galaxies which do not exhibit significant point - like nuclei ( eg .",
    "ngc 4418 ) .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn with respect to the optical spectral classification ",
    "i.e. most of the galaxies with nuclear point sources contributing significantly in the near - infrared are classified as seyfert or qso , yet not all of the galaxies with agn - like spectra have significant nuclear point sources at the resolution of these data .",
    "although these qualitative correlations are not unexpected , it should be underscored that we are here finding that , quantitatively , a significant fraction of the flux in the near - infrared is nucleated in these seven sources . at the same time , it is important to recognize that even in those galaxies with strong point - like nuclei , there is usually also a similar contribution from a component which is clearly extended .",
    "since it would be very difficult to have this extended component actually be scattered nuclear light , this extended flux is almost certainly stellar in nature .",
    "the half - light radii and mid - infrared color classifications are given for the entire sample in table 9 .",
    "a visual summary of the near  infrared nuclear concentration of our sample ligs and uligs is provided by fig .",
    "[ half_radius ] which shows the radii ( @xmath106 ) in which 50% of the total flux ( at @xmath107kpc ) is enclosed for all of the galaxies as a function of their far - infrared luminosities , for both the @xmath108 m and @xmath6 m data .",
    "( these half - light radii are not correlated with distance of the galaxies and hence , the measured variations are real . ) as described above , nearly all of the compact galaxies , those with r@xmath109 kpc , are warm ( or equivalently have agn or liner optical emission line classifications ) , although there are a few cold systems ( iras 12112@xmath1100305 , ngc 2623 , zw049.057 , and ugc 5101 ) that are nearly as compact at @xmath6 m . as a group ,",
    "the cold systems show a much larger spread in r@xmath111 than do the warm systems .",
    "figure  [ half_radius ] also clearly demonstrates that there is no correlation between the total far - infrared luminosity and the presence or absense of a significant nuclear point - source in the near - infrared .",
    "lastly , it is worth noting that r@xmath111 is generally smaller at 2.2 @xmath12 m than at either 1.1 or 1.6 @xmath12 m .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ ratio_half_radius ] which shows the ratio of r@xmath111 in each band . in virtually all cases , the 1.1 or 1.6 @xmath12 m sizes are similar and their ratio is tightly clustered near unity while the ratio of the 2.2 to 1.1 @xmath12 m sizes is typically @xmath112 with a larger range .",
    "( the three exceptions are all systems where the nuclear point source is dominant and the larger size at 2.2 @xmath12 m is simply due to the larger psf size at longer wavelengths . ) the smaller sizes of the cores at 2.2 @xmath12 m are very likely due to the large dust extinctions at shorter wavelengths which lead to an underestimation of the true nuclear emission component .",
    "the nuclei are systematically much redder in color than the inner galactic disks .",
    "both the analysis of the galaxy colors and light profiles suggest that much of the near - infrared light from the cold galaxies is stellar in origin .",
    "while ground - based , near - infrared spectroscopy of luminous infrared galaxies shows evidence for a mixture of red supergiant light , emission from hot dust , and possibly a metal - rich giant population ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the high surface brightness of the nuclei relative to the underlying galaxy at 12 @xmath12 m and the size of the slits used for the near - infrared spectroscopy ( 3@xmath10 ) indicate that the strong co absorption often seen is likely coming from the nuclei only ( @xcite ) .",
    "regardless whether or not the extended light comes from stars produced as a result of the merger , recent 825 imaging of two galaxies in the sample provide strong evidence that only the high surface brightness nuclear features observed in the near - infrared contribute significantly to the overall bolometric luminosity of these galaxies .",
    "mid - infrared observations by soifer ( 1998 ) show conclusively that the 25 @xmath12 m flux of arp 220 is produced within the nuclear region containing the two nuclei , and evans et al .",
    "( 1999a ) conclude that the 825 @xmath12 m emission in ngc 4418 is compact , indicated that most of the bolometric luminosity of the galaxy is coming from a region @xmath113 in diameter .",
    "thus , the starlight or agn responsible for heating the dust in these galaxies resides in the compact nuclear regions , which in many cases , are just becoming visible at near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the high resolution hst - nicmos images presented here for a sample of 24 luminous infrared galaxies have revealed extremely diverse morphology , probably reflecting their varying stages of galactic merging / interaction and evolution .",
    "eleven of the 24 systems exhibit double nuclei with projected separations between 0.4 and 7 kpc .",
    "eleven of the 24 systems also have point - like nuclear sources and in 7 of these galaxies , the nuclear sources produce a significant fraction ( @xmath114% ) of the total near - infrared flux .",
    "all but one of the systems with significant nuclear sources is classified as warm based on their mid - infrared colors .",
    "these 7 galaxies also possess nuclei with red near - infrared colors indicative of qso light mixed with varying amounts of hot dust . with the exception of ugc 5101 and vv114e ( and possibly three others ) ,",
    "all of the cold galaxies have nuclear near - infrared colors consistent with reddened starlight .",
    "the bright clusters seen in virtually every one of these galaxies have near - infrared colors consistent with ages @xmath115 yrs and their luminosities range up to @xmath116 . in a few cases , they are preferentially situated along the area of overlap of the two galactic disks ( eg .",
    "ngc 6090 and vv114 ) and were therefore probably formed by hydrodynamic gas compression of the ism .",
    "their masses are typically a factor of 100 greater than galactic globular clusters and therefore they are not simply young globular clusters .",
    "the relative contributions of agns and starlight to the near - infrared luminosity varies among the sample galaxies",
    ". the 7 systems with significant nuclear point - sources are likely to have significant agn contributions since they also have optical emission line ratios characteristic of a hard - spectrum ionization source . on the other hand , for the rest of the sample , most of the near - infrared flux clearly originates outside the central 100 - 300 pc , and even in those systems with significant nuclear sources there is still approximately 50% of the near - infrared emanating from a spatially extended stellar population .",
    "nine of the 24 systems exhibit an _ approximate _ r@xmath13 law ( typically over a factor of 30 in radius ) , suggesting that these systems will eventually become spirals with very massive central bulges or possibly even giant elliptical galaxies  the latter only if the remaining ism is converted into stars at high efficiency .",
    "the majority of the sample galaxies , however , show no statistically significant preference for either an r@xmath13 or exponential surface brightness profile over the range in radii probed by nicmos .",
    "we wish to acknowledge general contributions from many members of the nicmos idt which were critical to the success of these observations . c. boone helped with an extensive literature search during the planning of these observations and g. neugebauer , t. soifer , j. goldader , k. matthews , n. trentham , and j. carpenter provided helpful discussions .",
    "sylvain veilleux providing very helpful suggestions as referee .",
    "we also thank r. brunner and s. odewahn for help with source extractor .",
    "the nicmos project has been supported by nasa grant nag 5 - 3042 to the nicmos instrument definition team .",
    "this paper is based on observations with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope obtained at the space telescope science institute , which is operated by association of universities for research in astronomy , incorperated , under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 .",
    "to show both the small scale structure of bright sources and at the same time bring out the extended low - surface brightness emission in the galaxy envelopes , we developed a variable resolution convolution routine ( in idl ) which smooths the image with a boxcar filter with the resolution of the boxcar depending on the local signal - to - noise ratio in the image .",
    "the noise is measured near the sides of each image and the filter width at each pixel was set to @xmath117 where s(x , y ) and @xmath118 are the flux at each pixel and the rms noise . the gain",
    "constant , @xmath119 , was set to @xmath120 ( based on trial runs ) .",
    "( since the width could become very large where the signal was very weak , the maximum filter width was limited to the 10% of image width . ) for contour images involving one wavelength , the local filter width followed the above prescription using the flux in the individual image , but for images involving the combination of more than one band ( eg . the ratio images or for calculating the reddening ",
    "see below ) , the filter functions were determined for each band separately and then the applied filter at each pixel was taken to be the lowest resolution determined on either image .",
    "this ensured that the combined image involved data at the same resolution .",
    "in addition , for combined images , both were also smoothed by an @xmath51 resolution ( fwhm ) gaussian filter after having been passed through the adaptive filtering routine .",
    "an illustration of the variable smoothing is shown in figure  [ opt_smo ] . in the right panel , a contour map of the unsmoothed image is shown , while on the left is the same data with the variable smoothing applied .",
    "the contours levels are the identical for the two images and it can be clearly seen that the apative filtering managed to retain all the original detail where the signal was high but also brought out the low level signals much more clearly .",
    "it is noteworthy also the bright sources in the outer part of the galaxy ( where the adjacent background is low ) are also retained at the nearly the original resolution  that is the filter resolution adjusts quickly to compact bright sources .",
    "the adaptive filtering used here has the advantages of being both conceptually simple and yielding a predictable resolution .",
    "similar approaches have been explored before , although primarily for processing x - ray data @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we present near - infrared images obtained with the hst nicmos camera for a sample of 9 luminous ( ligs : @xmath0 l@xmath1 ) and 15 ultra - luminous ( uligs : @xmath2 l@xmath1 ) infrared galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the sample includes representative systems classified as warm ( @xmath3 ) and cold ( @xmath4 ) based on the mid - infrared colors and systems with nuclear emission lines classified as hii ( i.e. starburst ) , qso , seyfert and liner . </S>",
    "<S> the morphologies of the sample galaxies are diverse and provide further support for the idea that they are created by the collision or interactions of spiral galaxies . although no new nuclei are seen in the nicmos images , the nicmos images do reveal new spiral structures , bridges , and circumnuclear star clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the colors and the luminosities of the observed clusters are consistent with them being young ( @xmath5 yrs ) , formed as a result of galactic interactions and having masses much greater than those of galactic globular . in ngc 6090 and vv114 , they are preferentially situated along the area of overlap of the two galactic disks .    with the exception of </S>",
    "<S> ir 17208 - 0018 , all of the uligs have at least one compact ( @xmath6 m fwhm @xmath7 pc ) nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the near - infrared colors ( i.e. , @xmath8 vs. @xmath9 ) derived from 1.1@xmath10 diameter apertures suggests that the warm galaxies have near - infrared colors consistent with qso+hot dust emission and the cold galaxies , as a group , have near - infrared colors consistent with reddened starlight . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the cold ulig ugc 5101 ( and possibly three others ) have near - infrared colors suggesting an additional agn - like near - infrared component in the nucleus . in a 2 kpc - diameter aperture measurement , </S>",
    "<S> the global colors of all of the cold galaxies except ugc 5101 are consistent with starlight with a few magnitudes of visual extinction . </S>",
    "<S> the general dichotomy of the near - infrared properties of the warm and the cold galaxies are further supported by the light distributions - seven of the eight warm galaxies have unresolved nuclear emission that contributes significantly ( i.e. , @xmath11% ) to the total near - infrared luminosity . the smooth , more extended light observed in all of the galaxies is most likely comprised of giant and supergiant stars , but evidence at longer wavelengths suggests that these stars contribute little to the high 81000@xmath12 m luminosity of these galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> finally , light profiles of nine of the 24 systems were fit well by an r@xmath13 law ( and not so well by an exponential disk profile ) . </S>",
    "<S> whether these star systems eventually become massive central bulges or giant elliptical galaxies will depend on how efficiently the present ism is converted into stars </S>",
