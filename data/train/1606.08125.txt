    "from last few decades quantum mechanical systems with a position - dependent effective mass ( pdem ) have received considerable attention of researchers @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that such systems are relevant in describing many physical situations of interest . in non - relativistic scenarios",
    "pdem appears in many microstructures , such as compositionally graded crystals @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , semiconductor heterostructure @xcite , metal clusters @xcite and helium clusters @xcite etc .",
    "the concept of pdem arises from the effective - mass approximation which is useful in studying the motion of electrons in crystals @xcite .",
    "recent interest in this field arose from remarkable developments in crystal - growth techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy , which allows the fabrication of non - uniform semiconductor specimens with abrupt heterojunctions @xcite , where the effective mass of the charge carriers may depend on position .",
    "+ to study the transport of charge carriers through such heterostructures , the schrdinger equation can be solved either analytically or numerically by using different computational techniques . however , over the last few years a relativistic treatment has been proposed for evaluating the transport properties in condensed matter , such as the relativistic effects in the case of electron tunnelling through a multi - barrier system @xcite , even if the relativistic effects are very small . furthermore",
    ", this concept has been generalized to pdem systems @xcite .",
    "for example , in order to avoid some difficulties of the non - relativistic theory , the dirac equation has been used to describe quantum mechanical systems with pdem @xcite and a relativistic transfer matrix has been derived for a dirac electron moving in a fixed direction through rectangular barriers of arbitrary shape @xcite .",
    "most recently , the pdem systems have been used to describe the transport , aharonov - bohm , and topological effects in graphene molecular junctions and graphene nanorings @xcite .",
    "+ due to the above mentioned and abundant other applications , interest has been developed in finding exact solutions to pdem systems @xcite .",
    "however , the study of systems with position - dependent mass distribution involves some conceptual and mathematical problems of fundamental nature .",
    "an important issue that arises in this context is to deal with the incompatible nature of the operators concerning mass and momentum in the kinetic energy term , that arises due to dependence of mass on position .",
    "the most general form of the hamiltonian of a pdem system , proposed by oldwig von roos @xcite , is given as @xmath0+v(x),\\ ] ] where @xmath1 represents the potential energy term of the given system and @xmath2 are the ambiguity parameters related by the constraint @xmath3 .",
    "it is important to remark that different choices of the ambiguity parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , lead to distinct non - equivalent quantum hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "however , a particular set of values , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , initially suggested by lvy - leblond .",
    "@xcite , leads to symmetric ordering of the operators concerning the momentum and the position - dependent effective mass .",
    "this technique provides us with a self - adjoint quantum hamiltonian @xcite @xmath8 in the hilbert space @xmath9 , where prime denotes the differentiation with respect to the position variable @xmath10 .",
    "+ after quantizing the classical hamiltonian one can proceed for finding the exact solutions of the given system .",
    "the traditional way of obtaining exact solutions is to solve the corresponding schrdinger equation for the underlying pdem systems .",
    "however , there exist various other methods that can be more advantageous over the traditional way of solving this second order differential equation with spatially varying mass .",
    "these methods include supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) along with the property of shape invariance @xcite , method of point canonical transformations @xcite , potential algebras @xcite and path integration which relates the constant mass green s function to that of position - dependent mass @xcite .",
    "+ the factorization method for the pdem systems not only provides us with a powerful tool for obtaining solutions but it also enables us to determine the appropriate ladder operators for the system under consideration @xcite . this in turn allows us to obtain the underlying algebraic structure of a given system with spatially varying mass .",
    "the exact solutions and the underlying algebra of a pdem system has vast applications in different areas of mathematics and physics , such as they play an important role in the theory of coherent states @xcite .",
    "coherent states are extremely useful in various areas such as quantum mechanics @xcite , quantum optics @xcite , quantum information @xcite and group theory @xcite and have attracted attention of many researchers . in the pdem scenario",
    "authors have made several contributions @xcite .",
    "+ in our work we follow an algebraic technique to solve the quantum mechanical systems with pdem .",
    "the history of algebraic methods goes back to the seminal work of schrdinger @xcite and infeld and hull @xcite .",
    "later on these algebraic approaches were extended by using the concepts of supersymmetry @xcite and shape invariance @xcite , which have been extensively used to solve many quantum mechanical systems with constant mass @xcite .",
    "the application of supersymmetry to the non - relativistic quantum mechanics provides us with a deeper understanding of the analytically solvable hamiltonians as well as a set of powerful approximation techniques for dealing with the systems admitting no exact solutions @xcite .",
    "a fundamental role has been played by the concept of shape invariance in these developments @xcite .",
    "+ later on , this algebraic technique has been extended to incorporate position dependence of mass @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of pdem systems , this algebraic approach needs to be modified in order to incorporate the position dependence of mass in the kinetic energy term and related mathematical and physical difficulties .",
    "for instance , the intertwining operators are defined differently which leads to a modified shape invariance condition @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the earlier work in this regard is mainly focused on either the construction of the shape invariant potentials @xcite or the factorization of pdem hamiltonians and obtaining corresponding solutions which are restricted to harmonic or morse like spectra @xcite .",
    "moreover , the problem of finding the wavefunctions has been restricted either to a few lower excited states or to the eigenfunctions obtained formally by the solutions of the corresponding constant mass schrdinger equation .",
    "+ the present work provides a generalized formalism , based on susy qm and shape invariance , for obtaining the algebraic solutions of quantum mechanical systems with spatially varying mass .",
    "this algebraic formalism enable us to determine the complete energy spectrum of a given pdem system .",
    "for the sake of illustration a class of non - linear oscillators with spatially varying mass has been considered .",
    "the speciality of this particular choice is that the exact solutions for all the non - linear oscillators can be obtained by applying various approaches discussed above and the results are in complete agreement with each other @xcite . in each case",
    ", it is shown that as the variable mass approaches a constant mass , all the obtained results reduce to the well known results of the linear harmonic oscillator with constant mass . +",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : section 2 is dedicated to a self - contained study of the algebraic technique for the pdem quantum mechanical systems . in section 3 , this formalism has been applied to a class of non - linear oscillators with spatially varying mass .",
    "explicit expression for the energy spectrum and the corresponding wave functions are obtained in terms of @xmath11dependent modified hermite polynomials .",
    "properties of the family of orthogonal polynomials are also discussed .",
    "appropriate generating functions have been introduced and recurrence relations among different orders of these modified polynomials are also provided . finally in section 4 ,",
    "we close our work by some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we present a self - contained introduction to the factorization method , based on the idea of supersymmetry and shape invariance and discuss how to determine the spectrum and the corresponding eigensates for the quantum systems with position - dependent effective mass .      in order to apply the susy qm formalism , we introduce a pair of intertwining operators @xmath12 in such a way that @xmath13 admits the factorization @xmath14 which leads to the following relation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the ground - state energy .",
    "this is possible if and only if the super - potential @xmath17 , for the confining pdem system , satisfies the following riccati equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is related to the potential of the original hamilton @xmath20 as @xmath21 it is important to note that the construction of the intertwining operators ( [ op ] ) is based on the fact that they satisfy the following relation @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ground - state of the system and the corresponding wave function is defined as @xmath24 hence , the relation between the super - potential and the ground state wave function , is given as @xmath25 moreover , from ( [ c ] ) , it is clear that @xmath26 thus , we may say that @xmath27 acts as the ground state of @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "the supersymmetric partner hamiltonian of @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is associated partner potential , given as @xmath33 the above equation may be rewritten as @xmath34 note that the potential @xmath32 depends not only on the form of the variable mass @xmath35 but also on its supersymmetric partner potential @xmath19 . in order to examine the underlying supersymmetry of this formalism",
    ", we introduce the super charges @xmath36 that satisfy the susy qm superalgebra @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , the partner hamiltonians @xmath30 and @xmath39 are intertwined i.e. , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this indicates that there exist a relationship among their eigenenergies and eigenstates as @xmath42^{-1/2}\\hat{a}^{\\dag}|\\varphi_{n}^{(+)}\\rangle,~~n=0,1,2, .... \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of @xmath28 are known , one can immediately solve for the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of hamiltonian @xmath43 .",
    "these relationships , however , do not guarantee the solvability of either of the partner potentials @xmath44 . in principle",
    ", one would need to have found the solutions of one of the partner hamiltonians by some standard method , in order to obtain the solutions for the other .",
    "however , if these hamiltonians have the additional property of shape invariance , one can determine all eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of both partners without solving their schrdinger equations , as traditional methods requires .",
    "if both of the partner hamiltonians depend on a parameter @xmath45 and are related to each other in such a way that their associated potentials have the same functional form but for different value of the parameter @xmath45 , then the isospectral hamiltonians are said to be shape invariant .",
    "this means that there exist a function @xmath46 such that @xmath47 and @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the remainder term independent of the dynamical variables .",
    "the replacement of the set of parameters @xmath50 with the @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ 2.7 ] ) , is achieved by means of a similarity transformation @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an operator denoting the reparametrization , @xmath54 the most commonly discussed classes of shape invariant potentials are :    1 .",
    "translational shape invariance : @xmath55 .",
    "2 .   scaling shape invariance : @xmath56 .",
    "cyclic shape invariance : @xmath57 .",
    "however , in the present work we will restrict ourselves to the first class only , i.e. , we are only interested in translational shape invariant systems with position - dependent effective mass which are known to be exactly solvable .",
    "the significance of the shape invariance condition is that it allows us to determine the complete spectrum of the underlying system without even referring to its schrdinger equation @xcite . since the partner hamiltonians @xmath58 and @xmath59 ,",
    "differ only by a constant , they share common eigenfunctions , and their eigenvalues are related by the same additive constants as the hamiltonians themselves , i.e. , @xmath60 as already mentioned that @xmath61 is the ground state energy of @xmath62 with zero energy .",
    "first relation of ( [ nc ] ) suggests that @xmath63 let us now determine the excited states and corresponding eigenenergies of @xmath28 . using the intertwining relation @xmath64 , together with integrability ( [ 2.7 ] )",

    "@xmath68 this means that @xmath69 is an eigenstate of @xmath43 with energy @xmath70 .",
    "iteration of above process , provides us with the eigenenergies of @xmath28 , as @xmath71 by using the last relation the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian @xmath20 defined in eq .",
    "( [ 1.2 ] ) , come out to be @xmath72 where @xmath73 are the eigenenergies of the @xmath28 and @xmath16 is the ground state energy of @xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath20 are given as @xmath74 ) , the following simplified form can be used @xcite @xmath75 thus , we conclude that susy qm along with the property of shape invariance provides us with an excellent tool to determine the entire spectrum of solvable quantum systems through a step - by - step algebraic procedure , without going into the details of solving the corresponding schrdinger equation . also , it is important to note that the shape invariance condition does not always help one in determining the spectrum .",
    "another important ingredient required in this regard is the unbroken supersymmetry @xcite . in the ongoing analysis",
    ", we will assume that the supersymmetry is unbroken .",
    "many realistic phenomena in nature exhibit nonlinear oscillations which have motivated researchers to explore non - linear oscillators . in order to exemplify the general procedure discussed in the previous sections we consider a class of non - linear oscillators with pdem .",
    "all these systems are exactly solvable possessing translational shape - invariant potentials .",
    "we discuss the first example in detail and remaining can be solved following the same procedure as adopted for the first one .",
    "+ here it is important to emphasize that in all of the examples considered below we have used symmetric ordering approach @xcite in order to quantize the corresponding hamiltonians , as mentioned before in the general construction .",

    "so it is natural to expect that for @xmath127 all the properties the standard hermite polynomial are retained .",
    "the effect of the non - linearity parameter @xmath126 , that differentiates our modified hermite polynomial from the standard hermite polynomials is evident from fig .",
    "( [ hn ] ) which shows a comparison between standard hermite polynomials and @xmath128dependent hermite polynomials .",
    "+ furthermore , comparison of linear harmonic oscillator and non - linear oscillator with pdem can be seen easily from fig .",
    "( [ cln ] ) , which shows that the potential well in both cases is different .",
    "moreover , it is clear from fig .",

    "<S> keeping in view the ordering ambiguity that arises due to the presence of position - dependent effective mass in the kinetic energy term of the hamiltonian , a general scheme for obtaining algebraic solutions of quantum mechanical systems with position - dependent effective mass is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we quantize the hamiltonian of the pertaining system by using symmetric ordering of the operators concerning momentum and the spatially varying mass , initially proposed by von roos and lvy - leblond . </S>",
    "<S> the algebraic method , used to obtain the solutions , is based on the concepts of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and shape invariance . in order to exemplify the general formalism a class of non - linear oscillators has been considered . </S>",
    "<S> this class includes the particular example of a one - dimensional oscillator with different position - dependent effective mass profiles . </S>",
    "<S> explicit expressions for the eigenenergies and eigenfunctions in terms of generalized hermite polynomials are presented . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , properties of these modified hermite polynomials , like existence of generating function and recurrence relations among the polynomials have also been studied . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it has been shown that in the harmonic limit , all the results for the linear harmonic oscillator are recovered . </S>",
    "<S> + keywords : non - linear oscillator , supersymmetric quantum mechanics , shape invariance , isospectral hamiltonians , orthogonal polynomials . </S>"
