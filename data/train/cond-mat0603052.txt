    "dephasing of the optical polarization caused by the interaction with lattice vibrations ( phonons ) is inevitable in solid state nanostructures and presents a fundamental obstacle for their application in quantum computing .",
    "exciton dephasing in ingaas quantum dots ( qds ) has been recently studied by time - integrated four - wave mixing ( fwm ) measurements  @xcite . for the ground state",
    "excitonic transition in qds , the temporal dynamics of the measured nonlinear polarization shows an initial rapid decay within the first few picoseconds which is followed at later times by a much slower exponential decay of the zero - phonon line  @xcite .",
    "excited states , in turn , have a quite different behavior . it has been recently shown  @xcite that after an initial fast decay ( similar to that of the ground state ) the excited state polarization has a double - exponential decay . a related non - exponential long - time decay has been also observed in qd molecules  @xcite .",
    "the initial decay has been studied theoretically by vagov et al .",
    "@xcite , taking into account the interaction of a single exciton state of a qd with bulk acoustic phonons , and using the exactly solvable independent boson model ( bm )  @xcite .",
    "these results reproduce well the experimental fwm signal at short delay times  @xcite .",
    "however , there is no long - time decay in the bm . in order to go beyond one has to consider the phonon - assisted coupling between different excitonic states in the qd .",
    "recently we have developed a microscopic approach for the linear excitonic polarization in qds , taking into account both diagonal and nondiagonal coupling between different exciton states  @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we extend our theory to the nonlinear optical response of a multilevel excitonic system coupled to acoustic phonons and calculate the fwm polarization of the qd excited states .",
    "in the heterodyne technique used in  [ 14 ] , semiconductor qds are excited by a sequence of ultrashort pulses : @xmath0 the full hamiltonian of the optically - driven exciton - phonon system has the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the exciton - phonon hamiltonian and @xmath3 is the exciton - light interaction . here",
    "@xmath4 is the exciton dipole moment operator , @xmath5 is the qd vacuum state , and @xmath6 is the dipole moment of the given single - exciton state @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the optical polarization then takes the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "the particular form of the electric field , eq .",
    "( [ ef ] ) , allowed us to write the full evolution operator @xmath11 as a time - ordered product of operators @xmath12 due to each individual pulse .",
    "the latter can be calculated analytically in any order of @xmath13 , giving up to first order @xmath14 where @xmath15 . in the heterodyne technique with a double - pulse excitation ,",
    "the component proportional to @xmath16 is essentially filtered out from the full polarization : @xmath17 ^ 2 \\!e^\\ast_1 e_2 ^ 2 \\,p_{\\rm fwm}(t,\\tau)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the fwm polarization , @xmath19 is the delay time between the two pulses .",
    "neglecting biexcitonic effects , the hamiltonian of several excitonic states in a qd linearly coupled to acoustic phonons takes the form  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the bare exciton transition energy , and @xmath22 the exciton - phonon matrix element . the fwm polarization ( defined in sec.2 )",
    "can be written as a product of two infinite perturbation series @xmath23 where @xmath24 arranges all negative - time operators in the inverse order .",
    "the external brackets @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ series ] ) mean the finite - temperature expectation value which is taken over the phonon system and thus mixes interaction operators from both series .",
    "following  @xcite we use the cumulant expansion : for each pair of exciton states @xmath26 we calculate the cumulant @xmath27 defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 ,  @xmath30 ^ 2/2 $ ] , and so on . in numerical calculations",
    "we proceed up to second order in the cumulant thus taking into account both real and virtual phonon - assisted transitions between different exciton states  @xcite .    in the special case of a _ single level _ , the two series in eq .",
    "( [ series ] ) can be combined into one , extending the time integration from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , the interaction and time - order operators being redefined , respectively , to @xmath33 and @xmath34  @xmath35 for negative ( positive ) times . as in the linear polarization ( and in any higher - order nonlinear response ) , the cumulant expansion ends already in first order , giving exactly @xmath36 ^ 2}{p_l^\\ast(t+\\tau ) } ,   \\label{bm}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the linear polarization  @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ bm ] ) reproduces the result by vagov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , but is derived here in a more straightforward way .",
    "in order to simulate the measurable time - integrated fwm , we consider an ensemble of qds of different size and shape .",
    "variations of the qd size are mainly responsible for a wide distribution ( @xmath38mev in ingaas qds  @xcite ) of the exciton transition frequency . due to the phase prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ series ] ) , the transition frequency distribution leads to the photon echo effect : the fwm polarization from different dots destructively interfere at all times except those around @xmath39 , and the measured signal is @xmath40 . in a proper simulation",
    ", the latter has to be additionally averaged over a distribution of the qd excited states splitting , which is much narrower ( @xmath41mev  @xcite ) and is mainly due to qd shape variations .    to do this",
    ", we assume a pancake shape of a qd ( having a smaller size in @xmath42-direction ) with parabolic potentials for electrons and holes , which are additionally anisotropic in the @xmath43-plane . here",
    "we concentrate on exciton excited states formed from @xmath44- and @xmath45-type electron and hole states . without coulomb interaction",
    "the electron - hole pair has two bright ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) and two dark states ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "their energies are shown in fig.1 ( dashed curves ) as functions of the anisotropy splitting @xmath50 .",
    "switching on the coulomb interaction adds to the exciton hamiltonian a block - diagonal matrix , the bright and the dark states not talking to each other ( due to parity ) , and brings in an additional energy splitting within each doublet ( fig.1 , solid curves ) . at @xmath51 bright exciton states",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 are , respectively , exact symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the former states , the lower state @xmath52 accumulating the whole oscillator strength [ see fig.2(b ) ] .        quite explicitly , for these excited states the photon echo can be now written as @xmath54 remarkably , the dephasing rates @xmath55 and @xmath56 which show up in the fwm polarization , eq .  ( [ echoab ] ) , turn out to be exactly the same as in the linear polarization .",
    "the lower state ( @xmath52 ) which is considerably split off has a rather weak dephasing at @xmath57k [ fig.2(a ) ] which is mainly due to virtual transitions .",
    "the upper state , in turn , is always close to one of the dark states and has a much stronger dephasing due to real transitions",
    ". it rapidly changes with @xmath58 having maxima when the level distance is close to the typical energy ( @xmath59mev ) of the acoustic phonons coupled to the qd .",
    "the photon echo amplitudes shown in fig.2(b ) are mainly determined by the exciton dipole moments @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "the functions @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ echoab ] ) change rapidly at short times , while becoming constants in the long - time limit .",
    "these constant final values are nothing else than the zero - phonon weights which at low temperatures do not differ too much from unity .    the photon echo signal , eq .",
    "( [ echoab ] ) , shown in fig.3 for @xmath63mev ( thin curves ) have oscillations up to 200ps due to the mixed @xmath64-term .",
    "the rapid short - time decay ( corresponding to the broadband in the spectrum ) is also seen as lowering of both maxima and minima ( see the inset in fig.3 ) .",
    "we finally perform the averaging over an ensemble of qds having different @xmath43-anisotropy degree : @xmath65 , where @xmath66mev is used . the averaged function",
    "@xmath67 has oscillations only in the time scale of @xmath68 ( fig.3 , thick curves ) . at later times",
    "it is well approximated by a sum of two exponents ( fig.3 , circles ) with decay times 20.8ps and 922ps .",
    "the amplitudes and half decay rates of the bi - exponential fit are marked in fig.2 by stars .",
    "both amplitudes and rates are very close to those of the photon echo signal @xmath69 of the particular qd with @xmath63mev .",
    "thus , we believe that the measured double - exponential long - time decay  @xcite is due to the two bright excited states in qd , which have quite different dephasing times at low temperatures .    we thank p. borri and w. langbein for stimulating discussions .",
