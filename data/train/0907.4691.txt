    "for more than 2 decades , one of the most important goals in high - energy nuclear physics has been the study of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp for short ) .",
    "the existence of this deconfined phase of quarks and gluons has been unequivocally shown in many lattice qcd ( quantum chromodynamics ) studies ( for a recent study see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in those studies ,",
    "the phase transition ( cross - over ) temperature between the hadronic phase and the qgp phase is shown to be roughly about 200 mev when 3 light species ( @xmath0 ) of dynamic quarks are taken into account .",
    "this value of transition temperature is actually somewhat of a conundrum . on the one hand , this temperature , although exceeding two trillion kelvin , is nonetheless low enough to be accessible in accelerator experiments . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy scale corresponding to this temperature is too low for qcd to be perturbative , making analytic calculations difficult .    nevertheless ,",
    "combining the results from lattice qcd calculations , insights from perturbative thermal qcd calculations and also thermodynamics , we do know much about qualitative features of this new phase of the matter .",
    "accordingly , many researchers have proposed many different signals of the formation of the qgp in heavy ion collisions .",
    "many of these proposed signals utilize the fact that the energy density of qgp is extremely high . at @xmath1 ,",
    "the energy density easily exceeds @xmath2 .",
    "systems created at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) can reach maximum temperature of about @xmath3 . at this temperature , the energy density of qgp ( composed of gluons and @xmath0 quarks ) can be as high as @xmath4 .    not surprisingly , the three most prominent qgp signals that emerged from rhic experiments  the strong elliptic flow , the quenching of the high - energy ( jet- ) particles and the emergence of the medium - generated photons ",
    "are all measures of the high energy density and corresponding high pressure . among them",
    ", the jet - quenching phenomenon is perhaps the most direct observation of the high energy density .",
    "intuitively , it is easy to see that it will take an extremely dense matter to stop a particle with an extremely high energy . in this proceeding , a short summary of the various theoretical concepts that go into calculating the jet quenching ( equivalently , parton energy loss ) is presented .",
    "it is , of course , impossible to do justice to the vast amount of work performed by many different researchers in this short proceeding .",
    "what i will do mainly is to use the mcgill - amy approach @xcite that i am most familiar with as an illustrative example and highlight the differences between this and other approaches where possible .",
    "interested readers are directed to a more comprehensive review already in print @xcite and let me apologize here to people whose interesting works i can not fully cover here for the lack of space .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    the idea behind the jet - quenching phenomenon is rather intuitive . as depicted in figure [ fig : schematics ] , partons with high @xmath5 ( jets ) are produced when two hard partons from colliding hadrons undergo a hard scattering . in hadron - hadron collisions ( figure [ fig : schematics]-a ) , the jets then propagate and evolve in vacuum until they produce showers of particles in the detector",
    ". on the other hand , in heavy ion collisions jets produced by relatively rare hard collisions must propagate and evolve within the hot and dense medium ( qgp ) that is created by the rest of the system ( figure [ fig : schematics]-b ) . by measuring the difference between the outcome of these two experiments",
    ", one can then learn about the properties of the medium .",
    "the simplest consequence of having a dense medium is the energy - loss of the propagating parton , that is , `` jet - quenching '' .",
    "the usual way of showing the effect of energy - loss is to show the ratio of the momentum spectrum from @xmath6 scatterings and suitably normalized momentum spectrum from @xmath7 scatterings .",
    "this ratio is usually referred to as the `` @xmath8 '' and defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the observed hadron species and @xmath11 is the average number of hard binary collisions at the specified impact parameter .",
    "( as far as the present author can find out , the first use of @xmath8 appeared in 1990 in publications by m.  gyulassy and m.  plmer @xcite and m.  gyulassy and x .-",
    "wang @xcite . )",
    "experimental data from phenix and star collaborations spectacularly confirm that jet quenching is real .",
    "there is a sharp reduction of high energy particles in the away - side of the trigger particle @xcite and @xmath8 has a surprisingly small value of about @xmath12 for all measured range of the high @xmath5 in central collisions @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the calculations of the @xmath6 spectrum and the @xmath7 spectrum proceed as follows . for the @xmath6 case ,",
    "the jet cross - section is given by the following schematic perturbative - qcd formula @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the parton distribution function , @xmath15 is the parton level cross - section and @xmath16 is the fragmentation function . for @xmath7 collisions , we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the parton distribution function of the nucleus @xmath19 and the conditional probability @xmath20 contains the effect of the medium that changes the parton from @xmath21 to @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the temperature and the flow velocity profiles throughout the evolution .",
    "we also need to integrate over the nuclear and collision geometry .",
    "since the geometry is more or less fixed once the impact parameter range is known , the main task of a theoretician is then to calculate @xmath20 given the profiles of the temperature and the flow velocity .",
    "there are , however , some caveats that go with eq.([eq : sigmaaa ] ) . the @xmath6 formula ( [ eq : sigmapp ] ) is firmly based on the factorization theorem in qcd .",
    "in contrast , the factorization theorem that would put eq.([eq : sigmaaa ] ) on a firm setting is not yet fully proven .",
    "( gelis , lappi and venugopalan have taken promising initial steps in this direction @xcite . )",
    "another caveat is that the medium is finite and it is evolving all the time .",
    "the lifetime of the qgp created in a heavy ion collision is about 5fm / c .",
    "the size of the system is about 10fm .",
    "the hydrodynamic time scale is about @xmath25 .",
    "the mean free path of a particle in a qgp is also of order 1fm . none of these are very large or very small compared to the others .",
    "full accounting of these similar yet different length and time scales is therefore not an easy task .",
    "inevitably , one needs to make some assumptions and approximations .    with these caveats , nearly every theoretical approach to",
    "the energy - loss assumes that the above formula ( [ eq : sigmaaa ] ) is at least a good approximation . and that s what will be assumed in this paper as well .",
    "as mentioned above , the main task of a theoretician working on parton energy loss is to calculate the in - medium modification function @xmath20 .",
    "collisions with the thermal particles cause the changes in the propagating parton .",
    "hence , the fundamental quantity to calculate is the scattering cross - sections and the associated collision rates .",
    "if perturbation theory is valid , this would be a relatively straightforward calculation at least at the leading order . in a hot and dense matter , this is no - longer true : the dispersion relationship of a particle is no longer that in the vacuum .",
    "the scattering potentials are screened .",
    "extra divergences appear due to the frequent soft exchanges .",
    "all these conspire to make the loop expansion invalid .    for elastic scatterings , one can still regard the tree diagrams as the leading order @xcite . for radiational processes ,",
    "the above complications make non - trivial resummations necessary even for the leading order",
    ". one must include _ both _ the elastic and the inelastic scattering processes @xcite for phenomenology . here ,",
    "for brevity , we only discuss the inelastic radiational process .",
    "the first study of radiational energy loss was conducted in refs @xcite .",
    "this method is often referred to as the bdmps - z approach .",
    "the main thesis of this approach is as follows .",
    "consider a medium where the temperature is high enough that perturbation theory is valid . in this case , soft exchanges between the medium and the propagating parton result in the radiation of a hard collinear gluon . at the same time , the effect of multiple collisions is reduced because within the coherence length ( or formation time ) of the emitted gluon , all soft scatterings basically count as a single one .",
    "this landau - pomeranchuck - migdal ( lpm ) effect then necessitates the resummation of all diagrams depicted in in figure [ fig : the_big_picture2 ] in calculating the leading order gluon radiation rate .        in the original bdmps - z approach",
    "some simplifications and approximations were made .",
    "specifically , the medium was assumed to be composed of random static scatterers . also ,",
    "the thermal screening effect was only approximately taken into account using the approach advocated in ref.@xcite .",
    "the analysis was then carried out in the deep lpm regime and multiple emission is treated with the poisson ansatz @xcite .",
    "subsequent approaches to the energy loss calculations use more or less the same starting point .",
    "one still needs to calculate and sum the diagrams depicted in figure [ fig : the_big_picture2 ] .",
    "the difference between various approaches may be classified by the way each approach ( i ) treats the scattering centers , ( ii ) resums the diagrams , and ( iii ) deals with the evolving medium .",
    "these differences may be summarized as follows .",
    "the acronyms in the following list are the initials of the main authors except ht ( higher - twist ) and mcgill - amy . also , the references given are not exhaustive but just a starting point for further reading .",

    "ht    in this proceeding , i am going to use the mcgill - amy approach as the illustrative example to show what is involved in calculating each of the above items , simply because that is the one i am most familiar with .",
    "when the temperature is high enough , the asymptotic freedom property of the qcd makes it possible to treat qgp within the perturbation theory . the usual loop expansion , however , is no longer valid . the coherence effect ( the lpm effect )",
    "makes it necessary to resum an infinite number of generalized ladder diagrams shown in figure [ fig : rate_calc_amy]-a .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    technically , this comes about because connecting any of the three hard lines with a soft space - like gluon line ( labeled with @xmath26 ) introduces a pair of pinching poles in the loop - frequency space as illustrated in figure [ fig : rate_calc_amy]-b .",
    "the resulting pinching - pole singularity , when regulated by the hard - thermal - loop self - energies cancels the factors of the coupling constants introduced by the additional interaction vertices . within thermal field theory ,",
    "arnold , moore and yaffe rigorously proved that resummation of these generalized ladder diagrams is ncessary to get the leading order result ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "luckily , the resummation of the leading order contribution organizes itself into the schwinger - dyson type equation for the radiation vertex .",
    "figure [ fig : linear_integral_equation_gluon ] shows a diagrammatic representation of the sd equation ; the corresponding integral equation is @xmath27   \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad          + ( c_{\\rm a}/2)[{\\bf f}({\\bf h})-{\\bf f}({\\bf h}{+}p\\,{\\bf q}_\\perp ) ]           + ( c_{\\rm a}/2)[{\\bf f}({\\bf h})-{\\bf f}({\\bf h}{-}(p{-}k)\\ ,      { \\bf q}_\\perp ) ] \\big\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the original hard parton momentum and @xmath30 is the momentum of the radiated hard gluon .",
    "the masses appearing in the above equation are the medium induced thermal masses .",
    "the 2-d vector @xmath31 is defined to be @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the chosen longitudinal direction and is a measure of the acollinearity .",
    "the differential cross - section @xmath34 is the result of the hard - thermal - loop resummation .",
    "the open end of the vertex is then closed off with the bare vertex and the appropriate statistical factors to get the gluon radiation rate @xmath35 .    in this approach ,",
    "the medium consists of fully dynamic thermal quarks and gluons .",
    "furthermore , at least within the perturbation theory , the radiation rate so calculated is fully leading order in thermal qcd which sums an infinite number of the generalized ladder diagrams .",
    "the original amy calculation of the radiation rates was carried out in order to obtain the leading order transport coefficients in hot qgp within the kinetic theory . in ref.@xcite",
    "this is generalized to the case of propagating hard parton and its kinetic theory equation .",
    "the initial momentum distributions of the hard partons now evolve according to the following set of fokker - planck equations @xmath36 which also includes the effect of absorbing thermal energy from the medium . for the full phenomenological study ,",
    "this has to be supplemented by the local temperature and the flow information by independent hydrodynamics calculations . since there is nothing intrinsically boost - invariant about our formulation ,",
    "there is no restriction on what the underlying soft matter evolution should be .",
    "the rates appearing above then become time and space dependent through the local temperature and the flow velocity .",
    "finally , the resulting parton distribution at the final time is convoluted with the geometry and the vacuum fragmentation function to yield the medium modified fragmentation function @xcite : @xmath37 the resulting @xmath8 for @xmath38 is shown in figure [ fig : raa]-a which includes both the effects of the radiational energy loss and the collisional energy loss @xcite .     for @xmath38 calculated within the mcgill - amy approach . the panel ( a ) is from ref.@xcite and the panel ( b ) is a preliminary result from martini  an event generator being developed based on the mcgill - amy energy loss mechanism . in panel ( a ) , the red solid line is the full calculation .",

    "the data points are taken from @xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    \\(a ) ( b )    one thing to notice is that @xmath40 does not validate perturbative treatment since this implies @xmath41 . at this point ,",
    "mcgill - amy approach becomes a phenomenological model .",
    "however , i believe that this is the best one can do with current analytical tools since it at least includes all dynamic effects such as the energy - momentum conservation , broadening , thermal push , flavor change , elastic and inelastic energy losses except the interference between the vacuum and the in - medium processes @xcite .",
    "the last one is currently being worked on by the members of the mcgill - amy team .",
    "in the previous section , a particular approach  mcgill - amy  was described and shown to yield results that compare very favorably with the experimental data .",
    "as far as the nuclear modification factor @xmath8 is concerned , other approaches can equally well describe the experimental @xmath8 with a reasonable set of assumptions @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the theoretical efforts to understand the jet quenching has been successful .",
    "however , the question remains : what do we really learn about the medium when different approaches with different assumptions about the medium can describe the experimental data equally well ?    for instance , consider the temperature .",
    "since we are dealing with a thermalized system , finding the value of the temperature goes a long way to characterize that system .",
    "it sounds like measuring temperature ought be a simple task .",
    "even this , however , becomes a non - trivial task among different models .",
    "temperature appears as an explicit parameter of the calculation only in some models . in others ,",
    "the medium is treated as dense , but cold to simplify the calculation .",
    "the connection to the qgp property is then made through the transport coefficient @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the soft momentum exchange scale and @xmath44 is the mean free path .",
    "when soft exchange dominates the dynamics of the propagating hard parton , this should not be a bad approximation .",
    "however , this is still an indirect connection since @xmath43 and @xmath44 are independent free parameters instead of functions of @xmath45 and @xmath23 .",
    "combined with the differing treatments of the multiple emissions , it makes the determination of the temperature within such models rather fragile especially since the value of @xmath8 seems to be only weakly dependent on the value of @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "recently , a collective effort to resolve this and other issues has been initiated by the tec - hqm collaboration @xcite .",
    "right now the collaboration is performing standardized tests to see where exactly the differences between models lie .",
    "since the shape of @xmath8 is so featureless , i believe that the true test of models will come later when other observables such as the hard photon spectrum are calculated coherently within each approaches ( for instance the @xmath47 spectrum @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore quite encouraging that monte - carlo event generators based on the current works on the energy - loss mechanisms start to appear on the scene . in these proceedings ,",
    "some results from yajem @xcite , jewel @xcite , and q - pythia @xcite are reported . in the remaining space ,",
    "let me introduce the event generator being worked on by mcgill - amy team  martini ( modular algorithm for relativistic treatment of heavy ion interactions ) .",
    "the first , very preliminary result from martini is shown in figure [ fig : raa]-b .",
    "martini is a modular modification of pythia 8.1 to take into account the energy loss of hard partons before they can hadronize ( fragment ) into showers .",
    "hopefully , many more tests of the mcgill - amy approach can be performed on many different hadronic and electro - magnetic probes with this new development .",
