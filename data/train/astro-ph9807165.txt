    "searches for gravitational microlensing events by monitoring stars located in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the galactic bulge are being carried out and @xmath1 events have been detected ( alcock et al .  1997a , 1997b ; ansari et al .",
    "1996 ; udalski et al .  1997",
    "; alard & guibert 1997 ) .",
    "all of the information from current microlensing experiments is obtained from the einstein timescale , @xmath2 .",
    "one can obtain information about individual lenses because the einstein timescale is related to the physical parameters of the lens by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the physical size of the einstein ring , @xmath5 is the mass of the lens , @xmath6 is the lens - source transverse speed , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are the separations between the observer , lens , and source star . in addition , one can obtain information about galactic structure and the halo macho fraction from the measured optical depth , which is directly proportional to the sum of the timescales of individual events .    however , the einstein timescale alone can not fully constrain the physical parameters of individual lenses .",
    "this is because the einstein timescale depends on a combination of the physical parameters of the lens , i.e. , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . as a result",
    ", the nature of machos is still very uncertain despite the large number of detected events . therefore it is very important to devise a general method that can resolve the degeneracy in the lens parameters .    in general ,",
    "the problem of breaking the lens parameter degeneracy has been approached in two different ways .",
    "the first approach is through measuring the lens parallax ( gould 1994b ) .",
    "if the parallax of an event is measured , one can obtain the projected speed @xmath10 .",
    "the second approach is through measuring the lens proper motion , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the angular einstein ring radius .",
    "when both the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are determined , one can completely break the degeneracy and obtain the physical parameters of individual lenses by @xmath15^{-1}. } \\eqno(2)\\ ] ]    many methods to measure the lens parallax and the proper motion have been proposed .",
    "the parallaxes of lensing events can be measured in a general fashion from the simultaneous observations of the event from the ground and space ( gould 1994b , 1995 ; han & gould 1995 ; boutreux & gould 1997 ; gaudi & gould 1997 ) . one way to measure the lens proper motion is by utilizing the finite source size effect of lensing events , which can be measured photometrically ( gould 1994a ; nemiroff & wickramasinghe 1994 ; witt & mao 1994 ; witt 1995 ; peng 1997 ) , spectroscopically ( maoz & gould 1994 ; loeb & sasselov 1995 ) , and astrometrically ( mao & witt 1998 ) .",
    "proper motions can also be measured by using lunar occultation ( han , narayanan , & gould 1996 ) and by analyzing the light curves of binary source events ( han & gould 1997 ) . however , unlike the measurement of lens parallax , measurement of @xmath14 using the above methods is only possible for a few rare cases , such as very close lens - source encounter events .",
    "a much more general way of measuring the proper motion is by conducting an accurate astrometric measurement of the separation between the two source images during the event ( miyamoto & yoshii 1995 ) .",
    "this suggestion , however , is implausible because the expected separation for typical values of lens mass and distance is too small for direct observation of individual images .",
    "however , several planned interferometric observation missions , e.g. , the _ space interferometry mission _ ( allen , shao , & peterson 1997 , hereafter sim ) , can be used to measure the astrometric displacements in the light centroid caused by gravitational microlensing in events detected photometrically from the ground ( walker 1995 ; h-1pt g , novikov & polnarev 1995 ; paczyski 1998 ; boden , shao , & van buren 1998 ) . during the event ,",
    "the apparent position of the lensed source star traces out an ellipse ( ` astrometric ellipse ' ) , whose ellipticity depends on the lens - source impact parameter .",
    "the proper motion can be measured because the size of the astrometric ellipse is directly proportional to the einstein ring radius ( see   2 ) . however , except for a brief discussion of bright lenses by boden et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , all previous studies are based on the assumption of a dark lens .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the influence of bright lenses on the astrometric measurements of the centroid displacement and investigate this effect on the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "we find that if an event is caused by a bright lens , the centroid displacement is distorted by the flux of the lens and the resulting astrometric ellipse becomes rounder and smaller with increasing lens brightness , causing an incorrect determination of the angular einstein ring radius .",
    "a lens - blended event can not be distinguished from a dark lens event from the trajectory of the measured centroid displacements alone because both events have elliptical trajectories : the degeneracy between dark and bright lens events .",
    "we also find that even with information from the analysis of the light curve of the event it will still be difficult to resolve the degeneracy caused by the bright lens because the light curve is also affected by lens blending .",
    "when a source star is microlensed , it is split into two images . for a source with a separation @xmath16 from a lens ,",
    "the images are seen at @xmath17 \\theta_{\\rm e } , \\eqno(3)\\ ] ] with individual amplifications of @xmath18 . \\eqno(4)\\ ] ] the lens - source separation in units of the angular einstein ring radius is related to the lensing parameters by @xmath19^{1/2};\\qquad { \\cal t}= { t - t_0\\over t_{\\rm e } } , \\eqno(5)\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the impact parameter and @xmath21 is the time of maximum amplification . by symmetry , the images with respect to the lens lie at the same azimuth as the source , one on the same and the other on the opposite side of the source . under the assumption that the lens is dark ,",
    "the centroid of the image pair is defined by @xmath22\\theta_{\\rm e}. \\eqno(6)\\ ] ] then the location of the image centroid relative to the source star is determined by @xmath23 where the @xmath24 and @xmath25 axes represent the directions which are parallel and normal to the lens - source transverse motion .",
    "if we let @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , the coordinates are related by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the trajectory of the apparent source star image centroid traces out an ellipse during the event , the ` astrometric ellipse ' .",
    "once the astrometric ellipse is measured , one can determine the impact parameter of the event because the axis ratio of the ellipse is related to the impact parameter .",
    "what makes the measurement of astrometric shift useful lies in the fact that the size of the astrometric ellipse is directly proportional to the angular einstein ring radius .",
    "therefore , one can uniquely determine the proper motion by fitting the observed astrometric shifts to the theoretical trajectories in equations ( 7 ) combined with the timescale which is determined from the photometric observation of the event . in figure 1",
    ", we present the astrometric ellipses for various values of @xmath20 ( upper panel ) and the changes in the semimajor axis ( middle panel ) and in the axis ratio ( lower panel ) of the ellipse as a function of the impact parameter .",
    "if a lensing event is caused by a bright lens , on the other hand , the centroid shift is distorted by the flux of the lens : ` astrometric lens blending . ' the centroid displacement , which is measured with respect to a new reference position for the unlensed lens - source centroid by subtracting the relative motion of the center with respect to nearby stars , for the lens - blended event becomes @xmath32 the distortion factor caused by lens blending is related to the flux ratio between the lens and the source star before gravitational lensing amplification by @xmath33 \\over \\left [ 1+(\\ell_l/\\ell_s)\\right]\\left [ 1+(\\ell_l/\\ell_s ) u(u^2 + 4)^{1/2}/(u^2 + 2)\\right ] \\right\\}. \\eqno(10)\\ ] ]    the new trajectory is also an ellipse , but with different shape and size from that of an event caused by a dark lens . in the upper panel of figure 2 ,",
    "we present the astrometric ellipses for various values of @xmath34 for an example bright lens event with @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the apparent magnitude difference between the lens and source . by comparing the shapes and sizes of these ellipses for different values of @xmath34 ,",
    "one finds two trends : first , as the lens / source flux ratio increases , the astrometric ellipse becomes rounder .",
    "the axis ratios are @xmath37 , 0.446 , 0.532 , and 0.624 for @xmath38 , 1 , 0 , and @xmath39 , respectively , compared to the value of @xmath40 for the dark lens case .",
    "second , the size of the ellipse ( measured by the size of the semimajor axis ) decreases with increasing lens brightness .",
    "the semimajor axes of the ellipses in units of @xmath0 when @xmath38 , 1 , 0 , and @xmath39 are @xmath41 , 0.284 , 0.230 , and 0.153 , respectively , compared to the value of @xmath42 for the dark lens case .",
    "in the lower panel of figure 3 , we present the changes in the axis ratio ( @xmath43 : deformation factor ) and the semimajor axis ( @xmath44 : contraction factor ) of the astrometric ellipse as a function of @xmath34 .",
    "note that unlike the semimajor axis , the semiminor axis , @xmath45 , does not monotonically decrease with increasing lens brightness .",
    "it increases when @xmath34 is large , but then decreases as the lens brightness increases further .",
    "this transient increase in @xmath46 arises because the ellipse becomes both rounder and smaller .",
    "a lens - blended event can not be distinguished from a dark lens event just from the trajectory of the measured centroid displacements because both events have the same elliptical trajectories : the degeneracy between dark and bright lens events .",
    "if the centroid shifts of a bright lens event is fit to a model for a dark lens event not knowing the event is affected by the lens brightness , the size of the angular einstein ring radius will be underestimated .",
    "since the size of the angular einstein ring radius is directly proportional to the size of the astrometric ellipse , the ratio of the observed to the true size of the angular einstein ring radius is determined by @xmath47 where the term @xmath48 represents the contraction factor of the semimajor axis and the term @xmath49 is included because @xmath0 is determined not from @xmath50 but from @xmath51 , which is the impact parameter determined from the shape of the observed astrometric ellipse . in table 1",
    ", we list the values of best - fitting @xmath51 and @xmath52 which are determined from the dark lens fit to the observed astrometric centroid displacements of an example event with @xmath53 when it is blended with various lens brightnesses . from the table ,",
    "one finds that increasing the lens brightness causes @xmath51 to increase and the determined values of @xmath54 to decrease compare to their true values .",
    "an interesting fact to note is that although one obtains incorrect values of @xmath0 if lens - blending is not considered , the determined proper motions of events are relatively less affected by lens blending .",
    "this is because not only the astrometrically determined value of @xmath0 , but also the photometrically determined @xmath2 is underestimated due to lens blending .",
    "when the light curve of an event is blended with a bright lens , the determined timescale is reduced by a factor @xmath55^{1/2};\\qquad a_{\\rm min}=0.34(1+\\ell_l/\\ell_s)+1 \\eqno(12)\\ ] ] ( nemiroff 1997 ; han 1998 ) . in table 1 , we list the ratios of the photometrically determined timescale and resulting proper motion to their true values for events blended by lenses with various brightnesses .",
    "one finds that despite substantial changes in the values of both @xmath0 and @xmath2 , the determined proper motions do not deviate seriously from the true values .",
    "in the previous section , we showed that if an event is caused by a bright lens , the centroid displacement is distorted by the flux of the lens and the resulting astrometric ellipse becomes rounder and smaller with increasing lens brightnesses , causing an incorrect determination of @xmath0 .",
    "however , since the astrometric measurements of the centroid displacements will be conducted for events detected photometrically , one might think that it would be possible to correct the astrometric lens - blending effect with additional information from the analysis of the light curves .",
    "if the correct value of the impact parameter is obtained from the light curve , it will be possible to determine the lens / source flux ratio from the comparison of @xmath51 and @xmath50 .",
    "once @xmath56 is determined , it will be explicit to obtain the correct value of @xmath0 .",
    "however , we find that it will still be difficult to correct the lens - blending effect even with photometric information because light curve itself is also affected by lens blending : photometric lens blending . to demonstrate this we simulate lens - blended events toward both the galactic bulge and lmc under realistic observational conditions .",
    "we determine the uncertainty of the photometrically recovered @xmath20 by conducting both bright and dark lens fit to the simulated event light curve .",
    "the result of the fit is obtained by computing @xmath57 , i.e. , @xmath58 ^ 2 , \\eqno(13)\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the number of measurements , @xmath60 is the photometric precision , and @xmath61 is the number of parameters , which is 5 ( @xmath62 , @xmath21 , @xmath2 , @xmath20 , and @xmath56 ) . the light curve with lens blending is represented by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the absolute amplification of the event .",
    "the events are assumed to be observed with a frequency of @xmath65 during @xmath66 .",
    "for the values of the einstein timescales , we adopt @xmath67 and 40 days for the galactic bulge and lmc events , respectively , based on the most frequent values of actual events toward each direction ( alcock et al .  1997a , 1997b ) .",
    "the photometric precision is assumed to be @xmath68 for the galactic bulge events , while we assume @xmath69 for the lmc events as the source stars are faint .",
    "the uncertainties for both fits are determined by the @xmath70 level , which is equivalent to @xmath71 .    in table 2",
    ", we list the uncertainties in the photometrically determined impact parameters for bright lens events by both dark and bright lens fits . from the table , one finds the best - fitting impact parameter from the astrometric dark lens fit , @xmath51 listed in table 1 , lies within the uncertainty range of @xmath20 obtained from the photometric bright lens fit . although the best - fitting impact parameter from the astrometric dark lens fit is just beyond the uncertainty range of @xmath20 determined from the photometric dark lens fit , it will be very difficult to distinguish the two values considering the uncertainties accompanied to @xmath51 .",
    "this implies that lens - blending effect can not be detected from the simple comparison of the impact parameters which are determined both astrometrically and photometrically .",
    "in addition , one finds that the best - fitting @xmath20 from the photometric dark lens fit lies within the uncertainty range of @xmath20 obtained from the photometric lens blending fit , implying that lens blending can not also be easily detected photometrically .",
