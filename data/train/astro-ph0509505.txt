    "quasar absorption line systems have been observed at redshifts @xmath19 .",
    "they provide detailed information about the chemical content , kinematics , and ionization state of a variety of gaseous structures ranging from galaxies to the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "the population of weak absorbers [ those with rest frame equivalent width @xmath0   ] provides an opportunity to probe an otherwise elusive part of the network of structures .",
    "@xcite suggested that they may be produced by an early population of star clusters or by supernovae ejecta ( on large or small scales ) relating to an abundant population of otherwise invisible galaxies .",
    "regardless of their mechanism / s of origin , weak absorbers are likely to be important in a global picture of star formation , galaxy formation , and/or the interplay between galaxies and their surroundings .    because of the practical consideration of simplicity of optical observations , most of our information about weak absorbers is for redshifts in the range @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite conducted a comprehensive survey over this range , using high resolution spectrograph ( hires ; @xcite ) on the keck i telescope .",
    "they found a redshift path density of @xmath20 for weak absorbers with @xmath7   .",
    "two thirds of these absorbers have single clouds , unresolved at a resolution of @xmath21  , while the others have multiple clouds spread over tens to hundreds of .",
    "both statistically @xcite and in individual cases @xcite , it is found that weak systems arise in sub - lyman limit systems [ @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) ] .",
    "in fact , they comprise a significant fraction , at least 25% , of forest clouds in that column density range @xcite .",
    "the most surprising property of the single  cloud , weak absorbers is their high metallicities .",
    "the metallicity of the gas producing the absorption is usually constrained to be at least @xmath24% solar when constraints are available @xcite , but in several of the cases with the best constraints the values are solar or even supersolar @xcite .",
    "this is surprising in view of the fact that luminous galaxies are rarely found within a @xmath25  kpc impact parameter of the quasar @xcite . in some cases the ratio of to precludes the possibility of @xmath26enhancement from type ii supernovae , and therefore metals seem to generated `` _ in situ _ '' rather than ejected from distant giant galaxies @xcite .",
    "the observed redshift path density ( @xmath18 ) of weak absorbers is twice that of the strong absorbers which are known to be associated with luminous galaxies [ within @xmath27  kpc ; @xcite ] and which fully account for almost all of the cross ",
    "section such galaxies are expected to provide .",
    "we are thus drawn to the conclusion that as much of the sky is covered by significantly metal  enriched regions , that are not related to giant galaxies , as is covered by such galaxies .",
    "several other properties of the single  cloud , weak absorbers are relevant to an interpretation of their origins . from photoionization models ,",
    "the thickness of the absorbing region is on the order of @xmath28@xmath29  pcs @xcite .",
    "centered at the same velocity as the absorption is absorption which is constrained to arise in a separate higher  ionization region .",
    "this constraint generally comes from a consideration of whether the ionization parameters consistent with the low ionization absorption can produce the observed absorption .",
    "the two phase structure consists of a thin / small absorbing region ( with density @xmath30  ) and a larger ( hundreds of pcs to a couple kpcs ) , lower density region that produces absorption .",
    "the geometries of , and relationship between , these regions is uncertain , but flattened geometries are generally more consistent with number statistics and kinematics of the absorbers @xcite .",
    "there are a number of such indirect clues as to the nature of weak absorbers , but not yet any definite answers .",
    "obviously , the situation would be simplified if a direct connection was found between the absorber and a nearby , luminous structure .",
    "such structures might be dwarf galaxies , star  forming regions in intergalactic cold dark matter filaments , or intergalactic star clusters of some sort",
    ". if such objects are to be detected , they must be at low redshift .",
    "several absorbers have been detected at @xmath31 that , although is not covered in existing spectra , are almost certainly analogs to the weak absorber population at @xmath11 . in the case of the @xmath32 absorber toward @xmath14c @xmath33 ,",
    "there is a post  starbursting dwarf galaxy within @xmath34  kpc of the line  of  sight , which leads @xcite to the conclusion that winds from that dwarf are responsible for the absorption .",
    "a similar situation has been suggested to apply in the case of the @xmath35 absorber toward pks  @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "it is difficult , however , to be sure that a nearby galaxy is , in fact , itself responsible for such absorption , rather than a less luminous object in the same group or cluster .",
    "also , it may be important to make a distinction between single and multiple  cloud weak absorbers which may have different origins @xcite .",
    "finding a larger sample of @xmath1 weak absorber analogs was one of the motivations for this work .",
    "we report on our systematic survey of the archive of space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis)/ hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) observations of quasars .",
    "our survey facilitates a formal calculation of the redshift path density of weak absorber analogs at @xmath12 .",
    "this number can be compared with the value at @xmath10 to consider the evolution of the population of objects that produce weak absorption . based upon their properties ,",
    "it is not clear that these objects should be stable .",
    "their two phases of gas are not in pressure balance @xcite and a large amount of invisible matter ( baryonic or dark ) would be needed to attain gravitational stability @xcite .",
    "if we are studying the evolution of a transient population , we are learning about the evolution of the processes that created the absorbing structures . on the other hand , for a population of star clusters formed at very high redshift , we would expect a stable population of weak absorbers that followed cosmological evolution governed by a changing extragalactic background radiation .",
    "this paper begins with a description of the _ hst_/stis echelle data that were used for our survey .",
    "we describe how we are able to survey a significant pathlength by using the similar  1260 and  1335 transitions as tracers of . in ",
    "[ sec:3.1 ] we first discuss the individual systems found in our survey , describing their properties and the results of previous studies of them by other investigators .",
    "we then present in ",
    "[ sec:3.2 ] a formal calculation of the redshift number density , @xmath18 , correcting for our survey completeness . the expected evolution of the population of weak absorbers , taking into account the changing extragalactic background radiation is estimated in   [ sec:4 ] , and compared to the observed value . in   [ sec:5 ]",
    "the consequences of this for stability of the structures that give rise to weak absorption and for the nature of the processes that produce these structures are considered .",
    "the final section (   [ sec:6 ] ) contains a brief summary and conclusions .",
    "in order to detect weak , metal  line features and to cover most of the key transitions including the lyman series lines from potential absorbers at @xmath37 , high resolution spectra in the uv are required .",
    "the archived echelle spectra from _",
    "hst_/stis were used for our survey .",
    "a direct search for at @xmath31 would rely on spectra obtained with the e230 m grating . as of july 2004",
    ", there were about @xmath38 spectra available that covered @xmath39   to @xmath40   , the reddest coverage with this grating .",
    "unfortunately , each spectrum would only offer a limited redshift coverage of @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the maximum cumulative path length for the interval @xmath42 is then approximately @xmath43 , and this assumes the whole path length exceeds the required equivalent width limit .",
    "we would expect a maximum of three weak absorbers in this pathlength if @xmath44 as at @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , the e230 m spectra are quite noisy in the redward regions that would be relevant to our survey .",
    "this led us to consider and adopt an indirect approach , using  1260 and  1335 as tracers of weak absorbers in the e140 m spectra .",
    "the e140 m echelle grating of stis has a resolving power of @xmath46 ( corresponding to @xmath47  ) and simultaneous wavelength coverage from @xmath48 to @xmath49   . for our survey we searched @xmath50 spectra of quasars from the stis archive that were available before july 2004 .",
    "to allow detection of weak metal lines , our search was limited to spectra which have @xmath51 per pixel over a large fraction of the wavelength coverage .",
    "table [ tab : tab1 ] lists the @xmath50 quasar lines of sight that we searched , with quasar redshifts and some specifics of the _",
    "hst_/stis observations .",
    "the doublet is not covered for @xmath31 in the many high ",
    "quality e140 m echelle spectra available in the archive . to circumvent this limitation we instead used two other ions , and , to trace low ionization absorption",
    ". the 1260   transition of and the 1335   transition of are moderately strong in absorption and they conveniently fall within the wavelength regime of the available e140 m data set for redshift @xmath1 .",
    "the maximum possible cumulative path length for our survey would then be @xmath52 , a factor of @xmath53 times larger than a direct survey using e230 m spectra .",
    "the @xmath50 e140 m spectra used for our survey were obtained for a variety of reasons , and some of these reasons could introduce a bias in our survey .",
    "for example , a line of sight observed in order to study particular strong forest absorbers ( which were already known to be metal line systems ) could easily be biased toward having a weak absorber analog .",
    "a line of sight observed for a high velocity cloud study , however , would have no bias for presence or absence of weak absorber analogs .",
    "we list in table [ tab : tab1 ] the pi of the program to observe each quasar and the program i d to aid in consideration of this issue , which we discuss again in   [ sec:3.2 ] .",
    "the reduction and calibration of the e140 m spectra were performed using the standard stis pipeline @xcite .",
    "combination of separate exposures employed weighting by exposure time .",
    "similarly , overlapping orders were combined with equal weight .",
    "weighting by inverse variance ( as employed , e.g. , by @xcite ) was considered , but was found to bias the flux downward due to the lower variance of pixels with smaller counts . even smoothing over several pixels would not eliminate this effect in cases where individual exposures have @xmath54 .",
    "for some quasars that were observed at times separated by months or years , there was often a small shift in the echelle angle , and thus a change in the wavelength corresponding to a given pixel . in this case",
    "we selected one scale and combined the others by choosing the nearest pixel , rather than interpolation which would lead to smoothing .",
    "the drawback to the procedure we employed is a small , effective decrease in resolution .",
    "the continuum fit was performed interactively using the iraf sfit task , and employing standard methods as described in @xcite      to facilitate comparison to the intermediate redshift survey of @xcite , we estimate the rest ",
    "frame equivalent width that a weak  1260 and  1335 absorption feature would have , corresponding to the equivalent width threshold value of 0.3   for  2796 .",
    "given the fact that the ionization potentials of mg , si and c are similar , the relative equivalent widths of , and in any system would be largely governed by abundance pattern and by the oscillator strength of individual electronic transitions for each atom or ion .",
    "the lack of broad spectral coverage at high resolving power limits the number of weak systems for which the equivalent widths of  1260 ,  1335 , and  2796 are measured .",
    "however , the three single  cloud weak absorbers found in the spectra of pg  @xmath55 have all three absorption transitions covered and detected @xcite .",
    "the  1260 is a blended feature in one of the three absorption systems ( @xmath56 ) and hence only an upper limit could be established for that particular line .",
    "the ratio @xmath57 is @xmath58 for the @xmath59 system and @xmath60 for the @xmath61 system .",
    "similarly the ratios of @xmath62 are 1.45@xmath630.32 ( @xmath64 ) , @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , and @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "based on these known values , we used the average values of @xmath69 for the / ratio and @xmath70 for /.",
    "these values are also representative of those for isolated components of strong absorbers @xcite . in summary ,",
    "a metal  line absorber in our survey is classified as @xmath71 if the rest ",
    "frame equivalent width @xmath72   and @xmath73   .",
    "similarly , a detection limit of @xmath74   in  2796 ( as used by @xcite ) corresponds to @xmath75   in  1260 and @xmath74   in  1335 .    to detect weak , low ionization systems we first identified all absorption features detected at greater than @xmath76 significance , as illustrated in figure  [ fig:1 ]",
    "assuming each identified feature as a redshifted  1260 transition , we searched for a 5@xmath77 detection at the expected location of  1335 .",
    "the equivalent width limits for an unresolved line centered at each pixel were measured , taking into account the instrumental spread function , following the formalism of @xcite . in the event that both  1260 and  1335 were detected at a significance level of 5@xmath77",
    ", we then searched for absorption in neutral hydrogen , through ly@xmath26 and ly@xmath78 transitions at the derived redshift , in order to confirm the detection . in the absence of spectral coverage of both these lyman series features",
    ", we visually inspected the alignment and profile shapes of the low ionization features of and .",
    "for the @xmath50 quasar lines of sight , we found six weak analog absorbers in a redshift pathlength of @xmath79 5.3 within the redshift interval of 0 @xmath80 0.3 .",
    "of these , two have multiple clouds ( resolved low ionization spectral features offset in velocity space ) and the other four can be fit as single ",
    "cloud , low ionization absorbers .",
    "the key transitions covered in the stis spectra are illustrated for the six systems in figures  [ fig:2][fig:7 ] , and the equivalent widths and equivalent width limits for these transitions are listed in table  [ tab : tab2 ] . for selected transitions ,",
    "the column densities and doppler parameters derived by performing voigt profile fitting are listed in table  [ tab : tab3 ] .",
    "this system is the weakest , low ionization system that we detected in the stis e140 m archive .",
    "it is also the nearest extragalactic metal line system known so far . with @xmath82   , it falls below the completeness limit of our survey ( see   [ sec:3.2 ] ) .",
    "this system is unusual for a weak absorber analog , in that  1548 is not detected to a @xmath83 limit of @xmath84   . in a fuse spectrum , @xcite detect and six other lyman series lines and use these to derive @xmath85 , and possibly detect at a @xmath86 level .",
    "@xcite combine that information from the fuse spectrum with the stis e140 m spectrum , and derive physical conditions of the absorber .",
    "the low ionization gas is found to arise in a surprisingly thin cloud ( @xmath87  pc ) , consistent with sizes derived for some intermediate redshift single ",
    "cloud , weak absorbers @xcite .",
    "the derived metallicity of @xmath88 = -1.2 $ ] is , however , somewhat lower than that derived for many intermediate redshift counterparts @xcite .",
    "the absorber is thought to be in the outskirts of the nearby virgo cluster . specifically ,",
    "@xcite find a dwarf , post  starburst galaxy , which is part of the virgo cluster , at coincident velocity at an impact parameter of @xmath89  kpc from the line of sight , and use this to support the idea that winds from that galaxy are responsible for the absorption .",
    "this system is clearly a multiple  cloud , weak absorber analog , with two components resolved in  1260 and  1335 .",
    "the absorption follows the same kinematics , and is relatively weak compared to the low ionization absorption .",
    "the doublet is also detected .",
    "using the ratios of these absorption features , @xcite determined that a single phase , photoionized medium is consistent with the data , providing a simultaneous fit to transitions of various ionization .",
    "it should be noted , however , that an additional higher density phase is not excluded by the data .",
    "this quasar offers a different line  of  sight through the outskirts of the virgo cluster as it only @xmath92  kpc ( less than 1@xmath93 in the sky ) from the 3c  273 line of sight .",
    "this absorber is also part of the cluster environment at a coincident velocity with the absorber discussed previously , at @xmath94 along that line of sight .",
    "the large line  of  sight thickness of @xmath95  kpc that resulted from this relatively highly ionized cloud ( @xmath96 ) is in contrast to the small size of @xmath87  pc derived for the 3c  273 absorber @xcite .",
    "this led @xcite to suggest that a large filamentary structure , perhaps related to a wind , connects the two lines of sight .",
    "this line of sight was selected for observation because of its proximity to @xmath97 toward the virgo cluster . because of its special location",
    "there could be a bias introduced to our survey ( most likely a positive one ) , but no specific absorption system was known to exist in advance of the observation .",
    "the absorber is a single  cloud , weak system analog .",
    "the  1335 absorption profile is blended with galactic  1403 .",
    "the blend is confirmed by the detection of  1394 at @xmath100 .",
    "the and resonant doublets for the absorber are covered and detected in the spectrum and are likely to be produced by a separate high ionization phase of the absorber . multiple components are clearly detected in , extending blueward of the strongest component .",
    "@xcite have previously reported the presence of this metal line absorber .",
    "although current imaging surveys are below the sensitivity limit to detect a dwarf galaxy ( @xmath101 ) at the redshift of the absorber , a more luminous galaxy was found at a projected distance of @xmath102  kpc from the line of sight at a comparable recession velocity ( @xcite , @xcite ) . since the pg  @xmath98 line of sight was observed in order to study two strong forest absorbers that were known to have absorption , it was quite likely to have a weak absorber analog .",
    "we classify this system as a single  cloud , weak absorber analog , and the strength is directly confirmed by detection of with @xmath105 in a low resolution , g230 spectrum from stis @xcite . in the e140 m spectrum ,",
    "the  1260 and  1335 transitions are saturated , but can be consistently fit with a single component .",
    "both  1260 and  1206 are blended , possibly with absorption from metal  poor regions at redshifts @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "there is centered at the same velocity of the low ionization component , and an offset component at @xmath108   is also possibly detected in a noisy region of spectrum .",
    "the is also asymmetric relative to the low ionization gas , with additional absorption to the blue .",
    "this system has been studied by @xcite , using a fuse spectrum and g140l and g230l spectra from stis . in the fuse spectrum , is detected , and the lyman series lines and lyman limit break indicates that this is a lyman limit system , with @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "this is noteworthy , since most weak systems at @xmath11 do not produce lyman limit breaks .",
    "there is an @xmath110 galaxy consistent with the redshift of the absorber at an impact parameter of @xmath111  kpc @xcite .",
    "thus it appears this may be an absorber similar to a strong absorber , which might tend to produce weak low ionization absorption because of a relatively high impact parameter .",
    "since this line of sight was observed in order to study the same particular system that we have found in our survey , it clearly was biased .",
    "by our fitting procedure , this system is a single  cloud , weak analog absorber . a possible second component did not significantly improve ( by an `` f - test '' ) a simultaneous fit to the  1260 and  1193 lines or a fit to the  1335 line .",
    "however , @xcite do claim a second component is needed to fit the low ionization lines , and this is certainly a possibility especially in view of the similarity of their line profiles . in this case , the system is a multiple  cloud , weak absorber with a very weak offset component close in velocity to the primary .",
    "the doublet is not covered in the stis e140 spectrum .",
    "however  1548 is just detected , with @xmath114   in a low resolution fos / hst spectrum .",

    "the lyman series lines , a weak partial lyman limit break , various low and intermediate ionization lines ,  1239 , and  1032 were detected in the fuse spectrum .",
    "@xcite noted that this absorber had a particularly high ratio of to , which they took as evidence for its multiphase / multi  temperature nature .",
    "no specific galaxy has been identified with this absorber , but there is an excess of galaxies at this redshift indicating a possible galaxy group @xcite .",
    "this line of sight was proposed for observation in order to study a milky way high velocity cloud , so it is not biased for the purpose of our survey .",

    "however , we should note that there are quasars in the sample that would appear to have a similar level of positive bias that do not have detected weak absorber analogs . we do not think this systematic bias is large , and",
    ", as it turns out , even a factor of @xmath164 reduction in the value would not affect our basic conclusions .    after considering these possible systematics and biases",
    ", we expect that our observed value of @xmath143 for @xmath7   at @xmath1 is an accurate representation of the true value .",
    "systematics due to assumptions about the relationship between the , , and are unlikely to be large .",
    "the largest inaccuracy is judged to be a possible bias in quasars selected for stis observations toward the detection of weak absorbers .",
    "the population of structures that produce weak absorption could be different at different redshifts due to a variety of factors .",
    "the process of hierarchical structure growth and merging will lead to a change in the distribution of the total hydrogen column density in the universe .",
    "the metallicity of the universe will gradually increase and supernovae and their cumulative effects , superbubbles and superwinds , will redistribute gas .",
    "finally , the ionization state of the absorbers will change due to the evolution of the ionizing extragalactic background radiation ( ebr ) . due to the latter effect ,",
    "even a stable object with an unchanging total density distribution will be observed to have different absorption properties at different redshifts .",
    "the ebr is known to change with redshift , because of declining space density of bright quasars and star forming galaxies from 2 @xmath165 0 @xcite .",
    "therefore a population of weak absorber structures in the present epoch is expected to have different ionization properties and phase structures compared to the absorber population detected at higher redshifts .",
    "we consider , through examples , and statistically , the expected changes to the populations of structures that exist at @xmath11 as they evolve to the current epoch .",
    "this lends insight into the nature of the population of weak absorbers that is observed in the present .",
    "the @xcite spectrum defines the mean specific intensity of the radiation field as a function of energy and redshift .",
    "it is generated based on measurements of the qso luminosity function and the observed cloud population which absorbs the ebr .",
    "the haardt and madau formalism also offers provision for adding photons from star forming galaxies using stellar spectral energy distributions from @xcite . we adopt a qso plus star forming galaxy model with a @xmath24% escape fraction for our calculations , but also consider a `` qso  only '' model as the opposite extreme .",
    "for both models , we include the effect of absorption by the inter  galactic medium ( using observed parameters as described in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the predictable nature of the ebr allows us to hypothesize specifically how the phase structure of the weak absorber population at @xmath11 would change under the influence of a less intense metagalactic flux in the present epoch .",
    "qualitatively , the decreasing intensity of the ebr should lead to an increase in the ratio of low to high ionization states of an atom ( e.g. , / and / ) for a gaseous metal ",
    ". a larger contribution to the ebr by star forming galaxies will , in general , lead to a lower ionization state due to the relative absence of high energy photons .",
    "however , none of our conclusions below are significantly altered by varying assumptions about escape fraction from star forming galaxies or about absorption by the forest , as we will mention when relevant .",
    "photoionization calculations using cloudy @xcite have yielded estimates of densities , metallicities and temperatures in the low and high ionization phases of weak gas clouds at @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "almost all of the weak absorbers for which information is available have been demonstrated to have a multi  phase structure .",
    "the low ionization phase has a higher density and a smaller thickness / size than the high ionization phase . to guide our thinking on the evolution of weak absorbers we considered the expected evolution of three specific single cloud weak absorbers at redshifts of @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 along the line of sight to the quasar pg 1634 + 704 @xcite .",
    "these three absorbers appear to have phase structures that are typical of other weak systems that were found at intermediate redshifts @xcite , and can hence be treated as representatives of the absorber population . for detailed photoionization models for the three systems ,",
    "see @xcite .    for the purpose of this",
    "thought experiment , we assume that an absorber exists at @xmath12 for which the total hydrogen column densities , @xmath169 , electron number densities , @xmath170 , and metallicities , @xmath171 ( in solar units ) , of each of the two phases have the same values as they have for the absorber observed at intermediate redshift . these values , listed in table  [ tab :",
    "tab4 ] , are taken from @xcite .",
    "in other words , we are considering the effect of the ebr change on an otherwise static structure .",
    "the changing photon number density @xmath172 from the ebr leads to a change in the ionization parameter , @xmath173 , which directly affects the ionization state of the absorber .",
    "the cloudy code @xcite was used to solve for the ionization state of each phase of the absorber .",
    "the changes in the column densities of the various key transitions from the observed redshift to @xmath174 are listed in tables  [ tab : tab5 ] , [ tab : tab6 ] , and [ tab : tab7 ] .",
    "we then synthesized model spectra , noise  free , for the evolved model systems at @xmath174 as they would appear if observed at a resolution of @xmath3 . in order to synthesize these spectra",
    ", we used the column densities and temperature output by cloudy .",
    "the latter was used along with the turbulent @xmath175 parameter from the intermediate redshift model cloud in order to determine the observed @xmath176 and the corresponding @xmath175 values for all elements .",
    "figures  [ fig:10 ] , [ fig:11 ] , and [ fig:12 ] present the results of this evolution experiment .",
    "the individual model components are shown separately at the observed redshift and at @xmath174 , as well as the result of combining these components .    the @xmath177 system , summarized in table  [ tab : tab5 ] and",
    "figure  [ fig:10 ] , is the simplest system , with only a single  component required to fit the high ionization phase absorption . in this case , at @xmath174 the @xmath178 contribution from the high  ionization phase has increased by an order of magnitude , while its @xmath179 has decreased by about the same factor .",
    "this leads to a substantially stronger weak , low  ionization absorber at @xmath174 , which has absorption that may not even be detected in some spectra .",
    "table  [ tab : tab6 ] and figure  [ fig:11 ] present results for evolution of the @xmath180 system , which has two high  ionization phase clouds , one aligned with the low  ionization absorption , and one offset by @xmath181  . as we expect , the absorption strength increases and the absorption strength decreases at @xmath174 .",
    "however , the most noteworthy change is that the absorption from the offset high  ionization component becomes detectable at low redshift .",
    "this system may at @xmath174 be classified as a multiple cloud , weak absorber .",
    "the @xmath168 system , presented in table  [ tab : tab7 ] and figure  [ fig:12 ] , would also evolve into a multiple  cloud , weak absorber at @xmath174 .",
    "for this system , although the  1548 absorption is substantially weaker at @xmath174 than at @xmath168 , it is still comparable to the  2796 .    in general , the decreasing ebr will lead to an increase in the equivalent width for a given system .",
    "for these representative systems , this does not occur as a result of an increased equivalent width for the small , @xmath182@xmath29  pc , structure that produces the absorption at @xmath11 .",
    "instead , it is the result of a large increase in the absorption contributed by the larger ( hundreds of pcs to a few kpcs ) structure that produced the absorption at @xmath11 .",
    "often the profiles for weak absorbers at @xmath11 have multiple components @xcite",
    ". there could be detectable absorption at @xmath12 from each of the structures that produces such a component at @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , we expect a larger number of multiple  cloud , weak low ionization absorbers at low redshift",
    ". also , there will be an increase in @xmath183 centered on the original weak absorber , both from the small , higher density structure and from the large , lower density structure .",
    "these effects will lead to detection of a larger number of weak , low ",
    "ionization systems at @xmath12 than at @xmath11 .",
    "an excellent example of this is the @xmath168 system toward pg  @xmath184 ( see figure  [ fig:12 ] ) .",
    "in fact , this system was just below the detection threshold of the @xcite survey and was not detected in that survey .",
    "it would very easily be detectable if the same structure existed at @xmath174 , primary due to the contributed by the larger , lower density phase clouds .",
    "assuming the observed equivalent width distribution for @xmath45 , we can estimate the expected @xmath18 for that same population , evolved to @xmath185 ( the median for our survey ) subject to the changing ebr .",
    "our survey was limited to weak systems corresponding to the equivalent width interval @xmath186   .",
    "we demonstrated in   [ sec:4.2 ] that at @xmath185 these can result from the evolved phase or the evolved phase of an @xmath45 absorber .",
    "they can also result from @xmath45 clouds that are not related to detected absorbers at that time .",
    "for both of these possible predecessors of the @xmath185 weak absorber population , we estimate the expected @xmath18 result .",

    "then we integrate the appropriate observed equivalent width distribution for or absorbers at @xmath11 @xcite using those new corresponding values as limits .",
    "this is an estimate of how many absorbers should be in the observed interval at present .",

    "= 0.9 , a cloud structure with the same @xmath194 , and with the same metallicity , density , and size would produce an absorption feature with @xmath195  2 .",

    "a single , low ionization cloud with @xmath199  2 will have @xmath197   for a typical doppler @xmath175 parameter of @xmath200  .",

    "we therefore expect that the physical structures that would produce weak absorption at @xmath124 = 0.15 with @xmath204   , would correspond to the equivalent width interval @xmath205   at @xmath45 . from this result and the assumption that weak absorbers have similar total hydrogen column densities , densities , and metallicities at @xmath45 and @xmath185",
    ", a value for @xmath18 that we would expect to observe at @xmath185 can be calculated as follows .    the equivalent width distribution function",

    "we predict a contribution of @xmath218 to the expected numbers of weak absorbers .",
    "we consider how this estimate varies for different parameters describing the @xmath219 population .",
    "based on previous studies @xcite , we consider @xmath220 and @xmath221  , and @xmath175 values from @xmath164 to @xmath222  . in the optically thin regime , metallicity has little effect .",
    "however , density has a strong effect on the change of @xmath178 with redshift .",
    "this is due to the relatively strong dependence of @xmath178 on the ionization parameter , particularly in the range @xmath223 .",

    "however , we have found in   [ sec:4.2 ] that the phases of these absorbers do have a drastic change in their column densities .",
    "that is because their densities are in the range @xmath230   @xcite .",
    "next , we give a rough estimate of the @xmath18 of the population of weak absorbers at @xmath185 that should result from the evolved population of absorbers from @xmath11 .",
    "this is quite uncertain because of sensitivity to uncertain physical parameters of absorbers , and because of uncertainties in the observed equivalent width distribution of that population at @xmath11 .",
    "the equivalent width distribution for absorbers is best measured for @xmath231 for which is in the optical .",

    "it is also important to note that at least two of the systems ( the @xmath283 system toward rxj 1230.8 - 115 , the @xmath35 system toward pks 0405 - 123 , and possibly the @xmath284 system toward pg  @xmath112 ) are multiple  cloud weak absorbers .",
    "these could either arise from evolved multiple kiloparsec ",
    "scale cloud systems or from several parsec  scale clouds in a larger structure .",

    "the parsec  scale size and small velocity dispersions ( few ) for the structures responsible for the low ionization phase of weak absorbers at @xmath11 suggests they might be unstable over astronomical time scales .",

    "this is comparable to present limits on the amount of gas that could be present in globular clusters . in an intergalactic star cluster model , the absorption seen in @xmath11 weak absorbers",

    "scale components in such a star cluster / dark matter halo model should be relatively stable .",
    "alternatively , the structures could be transient , but could be regenerated at a rate consistent with the observed @xmath18 .",

    "absorption would arise in an interface layer between the low ionization shell or sheet and a hotter interior .",
    "these structures would not be stable on cosmological timescales , but similar structures would be continuously forming at a rate approximately proportional to the star formation rate . since the intensity of the ebr is found to decrease since @xmath11 @xcite , a scenario of this type would predict a decline in the overall number of weak absorbers from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "a third possibility for the origin of weak absorbers is that they arise in high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) , such as those observed around the milky way .",

    "most schemes for the origin of hvcs ( e.g. material falling into the local group , material ejected from the galaxy , or tidal debris related to satellites ) would lead to the prediction of a decreasing @xmath18 from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .    we must also consider the possible origins of the kiloparsec  scale structures that could evolve to produce weak absorption at @xmath12 .",

    "our survey may be slightly biased toward lines of sight with weak absorbers , thus the actual number may be somewhat smaller .    the apparent lack of evolution is deceptive because it suggests no change in the population of objects producing the absorption .",
    "however , the extragalactic background radiation intensity is known to decrease by a factor of @xmath309 from @xmath45 to @xmath185 @xcite .",
    "therefore the ionization state of absorbers will change .",
    "we considered how the three single  cloud , weak absorbers observed toward pg  @xmath55 at @xmath168 , @xmath177 , and @xmath180 would change if the same structures existed in the present .",
    "in general , the low ionization absorption grows stronger as the high ionization absorption becomes weaker .",
    "we found that the large , low density clouds that produced absorption at @xmath11 will produce observable , but weak , at @xmath12 .",
    "thus what was a single  cloud weak absorber at @xmath11 can become a multiple  cloud weak absorber at @xmath12 .",
    "because of the decreasing ionization state of absorbers from @xmath11 to @xmath12 , there would be absorbers that fell below a @xmath74   threshold at @xmath11 , but became detectable at @xmath11 .",
    "considering the expected evolution , and integrating the observed @xmath11 equivalent width distribution , we found that in fact this does not lead to a significant increase in the weak absorber population at @xmath12 .",
    "the column density is not very sensitive to ionization parameter in the relevant range .",
    "we predict a @xmath276 for the @xmath185 population of parsec  scale , weak absorbers . on the other hand , there are also many kilparsec  scale absorption systems that did not have detectable absorption at @xmath11 , but would become detectable in at @xmath12 . again , considering the @xmath11 population of absorbers and their properties , and assuming they are stable and change only due to the changing ebr",
    ", we expect @xmath276@xmath164 at @xmath185 .",
    "we conclude that the evolved population of structures observed to exist at @xmath11 should give rise to roughly two to three times more weak absorbers than are observed at @xmath12 .",
    "this expected @xmath12 population would likely be dominated by kiloparsec ",
    "scale , low density structures that only gave rise to absorption at @xmath11 .",
    "however , it would also have a @xmath15@xmath16% contribution from the evolved population of parsec  scale , higher density absorbers that produced weak absorption at @xmath11 .",
    "the numbers indicate that most kiloparsec ",
    "scale structures are evolving away from @xmath11 until the present .",
    "if all of them are evolving away , then it is possible that none of the parsec ",
    "scale structures are evolving away .",
    "this could mean that they are stable or that they are regenerated at a roughly constant rate .",
    "on the other hand , it seems somewhat more likely that some of the kiloparsec  scale structures will remain at @xmath12 .",
    "they could be related to satellites and their interactions or to superwind activity , effects that would decrease with time , but would not disappear .",
    "if so , then the parsec  scale structures would have to be transient , and their rate of generation would have to decrease with time .",
    "this would be consistent with models that explain weak absorption as supernova remnants , supershells , superwinds , or high velocity clouds , but not necessarily with intergalactic star clusters .",
    "although we have shown that weak absorbers exist at @xmath12 , we only now have hints about the relationship between the structures that produce this population and those that produce similar absorption at @xmath11 .",
    "if the low ionization absorption profiles could be observed at much higher resolution ( @xmath310 ) , it should be possible to dissect the @xmath12 population into parsec  scale and kiloparsec  scale components .",
    "clearly , studies that identify luminous objects that are related to the @xmath12 population are of great value . for both of those types of studies of @xmath12 weak absorbers",
    ", a larger sample would be quite useful ( larger than the six mentioned in this paper ) . for this , future uv spectroscopy missions are essential .",
    "finally , charting the evolution of the weak absorber population to redshifts of @xmath311 and @xmath312 will also provide constraints on its origins .",
