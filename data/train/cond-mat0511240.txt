    "dendrimers , characterized by regular branching with radial symmetry , represent a unique class of polymers possessing a large number of functional terminal groups in their outermost dendritic shell.@xcite these `` dream molecules''@xcite have recently attracted a lot of attention due to potential applications in technology and medicine , see , for example , refs .   and references therein .",
    "polyamidoamine ( pamam ) dendrimers , in particular , are commonly used molecules in this field .",
    "they are protonated under physiological conditions,@xcite thus their high surface charge coupled to their ability to adapt conformation in response to changes in their surrounding environment make pamam dendrimers very attractive candidates for biomedical applications such as drug and gene delivery.@xcite thus far , most theoretical and computational investigations have focused on neutral dendrimers.@xcite    since the pioneering paper of welch and muthukumar,@xcite there have been only a few computational studies of charged model dendrimers.@xcite while these studies have provided a great deal of insight into the properties of dendrimers , it is obvious that their scope has been limited due to a major computational cost associated with modeling of complex dendrimers in a hydrodynamic solvent .",
    "hence , the previous studies have treated the groups of a charged dendrimer using the linearized poisson ",
    "boltzmann ( debye  hckel ) theory , and the solvent as a continuous medium .",
    "despite these limitations , the above simulations demonstrated that the strength of electrostatic interactions may have a strong effect on the dendrimer s size as well as on other structural and dynamic properties .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the size of any charged dendrimer increases for an increasing effective screening length which corresponds to a decreasing salt concentration.@xcite    as for more accurate treatments , lee et al.@xcite simulated pamam dendrimers at an atomic resolution .",
    "they found that a pamam dendrimer swells significantly when ph decreases from a high ph value ( no amines are protonated ) to neutral ( all the primary amines are protonated ) , and to low ph ( all the primary amines and tertiary amines are protonated ) .",
    "however , they treated the counterions as well as the solvent implicitly ( except for dendrimers of second generation which were solvated in explicit water).@xcite a more realistic atomic - scale simulation of pamam dendrimers was performed very recently by goddard et al.,@xcite who accounted for water molecules and counterions in an explicit manner .",
    "they showed that the presence of solvent leads to a swelling of the dendrimer , while the effect of ph was found to be similar to that reported in earlier studies.@xcite as a part of counterions were found to condense onto the dendrimer,@xcite it was stated that the presence of counterions increases the swelling of a dendrimer .",
    "the effect of counterions on dendrimer charges and related structural aspects were not clarified , though , since for the counterion concentrations they used , the amine charges were strongly screened : the corresponding debye length was about 34 and hence close to the minimal value considered by welch and muthukumar.@xcite this implies that the effect of smaller counterion concentrations and , hence , the overall role of counterions has remained unresolved .    in general",
    ", there is reason to emphasize that the applicability of the debye ",
    "hckel approximation for dendrimers should not be taken for granted .",
    "it is valid in the dilute limit  here it means the situation where the separation between charges exceeds the bjerrum length .",
    "however , that condition breaks down easily in dense structures such as dendrimers , which implies that in most of the cases counterions must be taken _",
    "explicitly _ into account .",
    "computational studies of flexible linear polyelectrolytes have demonstrated@xcite that the presence of explicit counterions is indeed crucial : increasing the strength of electrostatic interactions can provoke counterion condensation and , therefore , lead to dramatic changes in the polymer s structure and dynamics .",
    "it is reasonable to expect similar counterion effects also for dendrimers",
    ". a recent computational study of model dendrimers suggests that this is indeed the case.@xcite    in this study we aim to clarify the role of counterions .",
    "we have performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations using a generic cationic model dendrimer of the fourth generation .",
    "counterions and solvent molecules are _ explicitly _ included .",
    "a systematic variation of the strength of electrostatic interactions have allowed us to examine the influence of counterions on the structural and dynamical properties of charged dendrimers .",
    "it turns out that the size of charged dendrimers depends _ non - monotonically _ on the strength of electrostatic interactions in the system clearly indicating a pronounced effect of counterion condensation .",
    "a sketch of the dendritic topology used in this study .",
    "beads of the last , or the terminal , generation shell ( the illustration is for a dendrimer of the second generation ) are positively charged ( black ) . in the simulations we used dendrimers of the fourth generation.,width=226 ]    we performed md simulations of dendrimers of the 4th generation using the freely jointed `` bead - and - spring '' model .",
    "each bead of the last , or the terminal , generation was set to carry a positive unit charge .",
    "the dendrimer was solvated in a box of non - polar molecules ( beads ) and an appropriate number of counterions was added to preserve overall charge neutrality .",
    "the bonds were modeled as harmonic springs with their potential energy given by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the reference bond length .",

    "the linear size of the simulation box size was set to 14.16@xmath15 , and periodic boundary conditions were applied in all three dimensions .",
    "the ratio of the average dendrimer size to the simulation box size was about 0.2 .    for simulating charged dendrimers ,",

    "this corresponds to physiological ( neutral ) ph conditions when the primary amines of a pamam dendrimer become protonated.@xcite to keep the system electroneutral , randomly chosen 48 solvent beads were converted to counterions by assigning negative unit charges on them .",

    "we examined the box size effects for a neutral dendrimer as well as for the charged dendrimers with @xmath27 and @xmath25 . for the case of neutral dendrimers we did not find any noticeable deviations when the larger box size was employed .",
    "for charged dendrimers , the average size of the counterion cloud around the dendrimer was found to naturally increase upon increasing the box size .",
    "this , however , did not produce any considerable changes in the structural or dynamic properties of dendrimers .",
    "as in previous computational studies,@xcite initial equilibration was monitored through the time evolution of the mean - square radius of gyration @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of beads and @xmath30 is the position of the center of mass ( cm ) of the dendrimer .",
    "this quantity , being a measure of the overall size of the dendrimer , was found to remain stable during the entire production run .",
    "the above , however , is not enough for a system containing unscreened charges . is it further required that the ions have reached equilibrium . to monitor the equilibration of ions , we first calculated the radial distribution functions ( rdfs ) for ion  ion , ion  dendrimer bead , and ion  solvent molecule pairs ( data not shown ) .",
    "the position of the first minimum defines the radius of the first coordination shell of a counterion .",
    "this procedure has been used in other related studies as well.@xcite the radius was found to be @xmath311.3@xmath15 .",
    "the coordination numbers were then calculated by counting the total numbers of beads within the first coordination shell .",
    "the coordination numbers are found to become stable as a function of time during the equilibration period ( see sect .",

    "next , we describe the structural characteristics of charged dendrimers at different strengths of electrostatic interactions . in fig .",
    "[ rg ] we plot the average mean - square radius of gyration @xmath22 of the dendrimer as a function of bjerrum length @xmath9 .",
    "remarkably , the dependence of @xmath22 on @xmath9 is found to be _ non - monotonic_. increasing the bjerrum length from zero leads to a pronounced swelling of the dendrimer , the maximum being at @xmath32 as shown in fig .",
    "further increase is found to have an opposite effect , i.e. , the dendrimer shrinks .",
    "such a behavior resembles the findings for linear@xcite and dendritic@xcite polyelectrolytes , and is associated with counterion condensation .",
    "figure  [ snap ] shows snapshots from our simulations for the swollen and shrunk dendrimers .",
    "the @xmath9-dependence for the radius of gyration calculated for charged beads of the terminal shell ( @xmath33 ) follows closely that of the whole dendrimer ( @xmath34 ) , see fig .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath33 exceeds the radius of gyration of the dendrimer at all bjerrum lengths . for neutral dendrimers",
    "this finding is in agreement with experimental data@xcite and with brownian dynamics simulations.@xcite as demonstrated in ref .  , and",
    "as we proceed to show , the fact that @xmath35 does _ not _ mean that beads of the terminal generation shell are localized near the dendrimer s periphery .    to clarify the role of counterions , we calculated the mean - square radius of gyration @xmath36 of the counterions , see fig .",
    "[ ions ] ( top ) . that serves as a measure for the size of the counterion cloud around the dendrimer .",
    "it turns out that the ion cloud becomes smaller as the bjerrum length increases .",
    "this decrease , however , is found to be monotonic .",
    "furthermore , in fig .  [ ions ] ( bottom ) we estimate the fraction of counterions condensed onto the dendrimer . for doing that we used a simple criterion , namely we counted counterions which had dendrimer beads in their first coordination shells . as fig .",
    "[ ions ] shows , the number of condensed ions increases continuously with the strength of electrostatic interactions in the system .",
    "the above suggests that there is a subtle interplay between two opposite effects upon increasing @xmath9 : ( _ i _ ) a growth in the strength of the _ repulsive _ electrostatic interactions between the charged terminal beads and ( _ ii _ ) a strengthening of condensation of counterions due to the _ attractive _ interactions between counterions and the oppositely charged dendrimer beads .",
    "the former leads to a swelling of the charged dendrimer and the latter screens positive charges of the terminal dendrimer generation giving rise to shrinking of the dendrimer .",
    "the maximum of the dendrimer s size is found to be at @xmath32 ( i.e. at @xmath37 ) , see fig .",
    "this corresponds to swelling by @xmath3112.5% with respect to the neutral case .",
    "condensation of counterions onto the dendrimer should be accompanied by a decrease in its hydration , which is characterized by the number of solvent molecules in the ion s first coordination shell .",
    "indeed , that can be seen by computing the average coordination numbers of counterions with dendrimer s beads and with solvent molecules , see fig .",
    "the increase of the strength of electrostatic interactions in the system provokes a condensation of counterions and , correspondingly , leads to a loss of solvent molecules from the ions first coordination ( hydration ) shell ( fig .",
    "[ cn ] ) .      to analyze the locations of the dendrimer s beads , solvent molecules , and counterions in more detail , we calculated componentwise number density profiles @xmath38 as a function of the radial distance @xmath39 from the center of mass ( cm ) of the dendrimer , see fig .",
    "[ density ] ( fig .",
    "[ beadnum ] shows the corresponding radial bead distributions ) .",
    "for a neutral dendrimer the density profiles are in agreement with earlier molecular dynamics studies of dendrimers in an explicit solvent.@xcite the overall number density of a dendrimer develops a plateau at @xmath40 from its cm . the beads of the terminal shell are broadly distributed , implying a considerable degree of back - folding .",
    "the solvent molecules penetrate deeply into the dendrimer and their density profile has a plateau at @xmath40 , see fig .",
    "[ density ] .    at small bjerrum lengths ( @xmath41 )",
    "the charged dendrimer swells and the density profile plateau broadens considerably with a simultaneous drop in the plateau s magnitude , see , e.g. , fig .  [ density ] for @xmath24 .",
    "the charged beads of the terminal shell are re - distributed towards the dendrimer s periphery making the interior of the dendrimer significantly more accessible for solvent and counterions .",
    "further increase in bjerrum length leads to a shrinkage since counterion condensation starts to dominate .",
    "therefore , the dendrimer s density profile changes towards a similar profile as observed at small @xmath9 with one important exception : the amount of condensed ions increases considerably , and their density profiles overlap more and more with the density profiles of the charged terminal beads of the dendrimer ( up to almost complete coincidence of the profiles in the case of extremely large bjerrum lengths , see fig .  [ density ] for @xmath42 ) . this shrinkage is accompanied by a reduction of voids in the dendrimer s interior leading to squeezing of solvent molecules out of the dendrimer , see figs .  [ density ] and [ beadnum ] .",
    "next , we take a look at the screening of the dendrimer s charges by counterions . in fig .",
    "[ charge ] we plot the charge density profiles @xmath43 for the whole system as a function of the radial distance @xmath39 from the cm of the dendrimer .",
    "we recall that since our solvent is non - polar , the charge densities @xmath43 are defined only by the interplay between the positively charged terminal beads and the negatively charged counterions .",
    "figure  [ charge ] clearly demonstrates screening : the height of the positive @xmath43-peaks drops drastically with increasing bjerrum length as compared to the @xmath43-peak for @xmath44 when the counterion condensation has just started .",
    "while the main peaks of all @xmath43-curves are located in the domain of the positive charges , starting with @xmath45 , one observes small minima close to the cm of the dendrimer where @xmath43 becomes negative , see fig .",
    "[ charge ] .",
    "we address these minima to the fact that some of condensed counterions can be localized deep in the dendrimer s interior rather than beside charged terminal beads giving rise to an excess of negative charges close to the dendrimer s center of mass , see figs .",
    "[ density ] and [ beadnum ] . in turn , on the right of @xmath43-peaks we see another region where the overall charge of the system is also negative .",
    "this region of negative charge , being associated with `` unbound '' counterions in bulk solvent , becomes smaller with @xmath9 and eventually disappears at large bjerrum lengths .",
    "radial charge densities @xmath43 as a function of the radial distance @xmath39 from the cm of a dendrimer for @xmath26 equal to 0.2@xmath15 ( solid line ) , 0.4@xmath15 ( dashed line ) , 0.8@xmath15 ( solid line with circles ) , and 3.2@xmath15 ( solid line with stars ) . to reduce the noise in the data , the charge densities shown here were first fitted to splines.@xcite , width=302 ]",
    "the molecular dynamics simulation technique provides an access to the dynamic properties , and next we discuss the dynamics of charged dendrimers in a salt - free solution .",
    "first , we consider the relaxation of vectors pointing from the center of mass ( cm ) of the dendrimer to the beads of a given generation shell.@xcite if the terminal ( g4 ) generation shell is considered , the corresponding autocorrelation function ( acf ) of `` cm - g4 '' vector can be employed to analyze the global reorientational behavior of the whole dendrimer.@xcite it is , however , necessary to bear in mind that there is no reason for the beads of the last generation to be located at the dendrimer s periphery .    in general , relaxation of the `` cm - g4 '' vector is determined by the rotation of the whole dendrimer together with fluctuations in the vector s length . to characterize the dendrimer s rotation",
    ", we calculated the acf of the _ unit _ vector directed along the `` cm - g4 '' vector .",
    "it turns out that the corresponding relaxation times @xmath46 are very close to the relaxation time of the `` cm - g4 '' vector ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "thus , the relaxation of the `` cm - g4 '' vector is governed almost exclusively by the rotation of the dendrimer in agreement with the results from brownian dynamics simulations of dendrimers with rigid bonds.@xcite     characteristic relaxation times @xmath47 and @xmath46 related to the dendrimer s reorientational dynamics as extracted from the corresponding autocorrelation functions of vectors pointing from the cm of the dendrimer to the beads of its terminal g4 generation shell , see text for details .",
    "error bars are of the order of the symbol size .",
    ", width=302 ]    figure  [ taureo ] shows that the global reorientational motion of the charged dendrimer depends non - monotonically on the bjerrum length .",
    "such a behavior resembles the @xmath9-dependence of @xmath22 as was seen earlier in fig .",
    "this is expected since it is reasonable to assume that the global reorientational dynamics is controlled by the dendrimer s size : larger size requires more time for reorientation .    as fig .",
    "[ taureo ] shows , there is a sharp maximum at @xmath32 .",
    "it is also interesting that although at large bjerrum lengths the average size of the charged dendrimer is found to be smaller than the size of a neutral dendrimer ( fig .",
    "[ rg ] ) , that is not reflected in the characteristic relaxation times shown in fig .",
    "[ taureo ] .",
    "the former can be explained by the inhomogeneous distribution of counterions inside the dendrimer , giving rise to the additional electrostatic attraction between different parts of the dendrimer interior . on the other hand ,",
    "the global reorientation dynamics is not only governed by the dendrimer s size but also by its mass . at @xmath48",
    "almost all counterions are bound to the dendrimer ( fig .",
    "[ ions ] ) , thus increasing the dendrimer s effective mass by a factor of 1.5 in comparison to the neutral one .",
    "this , in turn , slows down the global reorientational motion of a dendrimer .",

    "[ p1 ] we plot the time evolution of the corresponding autocorrelation function @xmath49 for the innermost ( g0 ) and the outermost ( g4 ) shells .",
    "we note that the relaxation of @xmath52 can not be characterized by a single relaxation time .",

    "@xcite the core and the cm are typically found to be very close to each other .",
    "however , they do not exactly coincide and the relaxation of the corresponding `` cm - core '' vector is characterized by small ( but finite ) relaxation times .    in fig .",

    "[ rg ] , i.e. , increase in the dendrimer size speeds up the relaxation of the `` cm - core '' vector and _ vice versa_. this effect can be explained in terms of the mobility of a dendrimer core : larger dendrimers are characterized by smaller densities of their interior ( see fig .  [ density ] ) and , therefore , by more mobile cores which relax faster .",
    "we have performed a systematic molecular dynamics study of generic cationic dendrimers solvated in _",

    "the main goal was to understand to what degree the structural and dynamic properties of charged dendrimers are sensitive to the strength of electrostatic interactions , and what is the role of counterions .",

    "depending on the type of dominant interactions , one observes swelling or shrinking of the molecule as the strength of the electrostatic interactions is increased . in other words ,",
    "the size of a charged dendrimer depends _ non - monotonically _ on the bjerrum length @xmath9 as shown in fig .",
    "most of the dendrimer s structural and dynamic characteristics considered in this study were found to follow this pattern .    for small bjerrum lengths a charged dendrimer swells with @xmath9 and",
    "its size reaches maximum at @xmath58 . at larger bjerrum lengths the condensation of counterions dominates and the dendrimer shrinks .",
    "the counterion condensation is often discussed in the framework of the manning theory,@xcite which predicts the condensation to occur when @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the distance between charges along the polymer backbone .",
    "however , the manning s criterion is not applicable in our case .",
    "the manning s theory is formulated for linear polyelectrolytes and not for spherical - like branched objects such as dendrimers .",
    "second , the charged dendrimer considered in our study has only its terminal beads charged , making the meaning of the parameter @xmath60 uncertain .",
    "the counterion condensation , the effects of valence , charging , and the size and shape of the dendrimer could more appropriately be studied using the method of patra  et  al.@xcite who studied the charging of spherical three dimensional objects under different conditions .",
    "a detailed study of the above factors is , however , beyond the current work and will be addressed in a future publication .",
    "the bjerrum length @xmath61 corresponds to the position of the @xmath22-peak , see fig .",
    "[ rg ] , and , therefore , separates swelling and shrinking regimes . remarkably , on the left - hand side of the peak , the separation between charges _ always _ exceeds the bjerrum length because the beads can not get closer than @xmath62 and @xmath63 . on the other hand ,",
    "the counterion condensation is rather weak in this @xmath9-domain .",
    "therefore , one can expect the debye  hckel approximation to be valid at around @xmath64 and to break down at larger bjerrum lengths .",
    "it is instructive to relate the dendrimer bond length @xmath15 ( and , correspondingly , the average dendrimer size @xmath65 and the bjerrum length @xmath9 ) to the characteristic length scales typical for real dendrimers in aqueous solutions .",
    "the value of 17.1 is available from small angle x - ray scattering experiments@xcite for the average radius of gyration @xmath65 of a pamam dendrimer of the fourth generation .",
    "a very recent md study@xcite reported @xmath66 for a non - protonated pamam dendrimer in explicit water .",
    "in another study , lee et al .",
    "@xcite reported @xmath67 .",
    "that was obtained from md studies of pamam dendrimers without solvent ( @xmath68 in ref .",

    "assuming that dendrimer swells on about 15% in water,@xcite the results of lee et al.@xcite seem to be in accord with other studies .",
    "we took @xmath69 for our parameterization . for a neutral dendrimer we have @xmath70 ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ rg ] , such that @xmath71 .",
    "thus , the critical bjerrum length corresponding to the dendrimer s maximal size can be estimated to be 5.4 . in turn , the bjerrum length in water at 300 k is about 7.1 ( or @xmath72 ) , i.e. , it exceeds the critical value . in practice , since the @xmath22-peak is not very sharp , the value of @xmath22 for a dendrimer in _ water _",
    ", being located next to the peak , is rather close to the maximum of @xmath22 , see fig .",
    "[ rg ] . taking also into account the uncertainty in defining the value of @xmath15",
    ", one can conclude that counterion condensation will not affect significantly pamam dendrimers in water under physiological conditions .",
    "to summarize , we demonstrated that including explicit counterions can have a dramatic effect on the structure and dynamics of charged dendrimers , and under certain conditions they can not be treated implicitly .",
    "therefore , simplified approaches , such as the well - known debye ",
    "hckel approximation , have to be applied with great care . given that the most exciting applications of protonated dendrimers are related to drug and gene delivery , it would be interesting to clarify the role of counterions in complexation of charged dendrimers with linear polyelectrolytes bearing opposite charges .",

    "<S> polyamidoamine ( pamam ) dendrimers , being protonated under physiological conditions , represent a promising class of nonviral , nano - sized vectors for drug and gene delivery . </S>",
    "<S> we performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations of a generic model dendrimer in a salt - free solution with dendrimer s terminal beads positively charged . </S>",
    "<S> solvent molecules as well as counterions were _ explicitly _ included as interacting beads . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the size of the charged dendrimer depends _ non - monotonically _ on the strength of electrostatic interactions demonstrating a maximum when the bjerrum length equals the diameter of a bead . </S>",
    "<S> many other structural and dynamic characteristics of charged dendrimers are also found to follow this pattern . </S>",
    "<S> we address such a behavior to the interplay between repulsive interactions of the charged terminal beads and their attractive interactions with oppositely charged counterions . </S>",
    "<S> the former favors swelling at small bjerrum lengths and the latter promotes counterion condensation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , counterions can have a dramatic effect on the structure and dynamics of charged dendrimers and , under certain conditions , can not be treated implicitly . </S>"
