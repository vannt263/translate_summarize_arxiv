    "in recent years , the development of noncommutative geometry has sparked much interest in formulating physics and in particular quantum field theory on quantized , i.e. noncommutative spacetime .",
    "the idea is that if there are no more `` points '' in spacetime , such a theory should be well behaved in the uv .",
    "quantum groups @xcite , although discovered in a different context , can be understood as generalized `` symmetries '' of certain quantum spaces .",
    "thinking of elementary particles as irreducible unitary representations of the poincar group , it is natural to try to formulate a quantum field theory based on some quantum poincar group , i.e. on some quantized spacetime .",
    "there have been many attempts ( e.g. @xcite ) in this direction .",
    "one of the difficulties with many versions of a quantum poincar group comes from the fact that the classical poincar group is not semisimple .",
    "this forbids using the well developed theory of ( semi)simple quantum groups , which is e.g. reviewed in @xcite . in this paper , we consider instead the quantum anti  de sitter group @xmath1 , resp .",
    "@xmath0 in 2 dimensions , thus taking advantage of much well  known mathematical machinery . in the classical case , these groups ( as opposed to e.g. the de sitter group @xmath9 ) are known to have positive  energy representations for any spin @xcite , and e.g. allow supersymmetric extensions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one could argue that the usual choice of flat spacetime is a singular choice , perhaps subject to some mathematical artefacts .    with this motivation ,",
    "we study unitary representations of @xmath1 .",
    "classically , all unitary representations are infinite ",
    "dimensional since the group is noncompact .",
    "it is well known that at roots of unity , the irreducible representations ( irreps ) of quantum groups are finite dimensional . in this paper , we determine if they are unitarizable , and show in particular that for @xmath5 , all the irreps with positive energy and integral weights are unitarizable , as long as the rest energy @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the spin , and @xmath12 is below some ( @xmath2  dependent , large ) limit .",
    "there is an intrinsic high  energy cutoff , and only finitely many such `` physical '' representations exist for given @xmath2 . at low energies and for @xmath2 close enough to 1 , the structure is the same as in the classical case .",
    "furthermore , unitary exist only at roots of unity ( if @xmath2 is a phase ) . for generic roots of unity , their weights are non  integral .",
    "analogous results are found for @xmath0 . in general , there is a cell  like structure of unitary in weight space .    in the `` massless '' case ,",
    "the naive with spin bigger than or equal to 1 are reducible and contain a null subspace corresponding to `` pure gauge '' states .",
    "it is shown that they can be consistently factored out to obtain unitary representations with only the physical degrees of freedom ( `` helicities '' ) , as in the classical case @xcite .",
    "the existence of finite  dimensional unitary representations of noncompact quantum groups at roots of unity has already been pointed out in @xcite , where several representations of @xmath13 and @xmath1 ( with multiplicity of weights equal to one ) are shown to be unitarizable . in the latter case",
    "they correspond to the dirac singletons @xcite , which are recovered here as well .",
    "we also show that the class of `` physical '' ( unitarizable ) representations is closed under a new kind of associative truncated tensor product for @xmath3 , i.e. there exists a natural way to obtain many  particle representations .",
    "besides being very encouraging from the point of view of quantum field theory , this shows again the markedly different properties of quantum groups at roots of unity from the case of generic @xmath2 and @xmath14 .",
    "the results are clearly not restricted to the groups considered here and should be of interest on purely mathematical grounds as well .",
    "we develop a method to investigate the structure of representations of quantum groups at roots of unity and determine the structure of a large class of of @xmath1 . throughout this paper , @xmath1 will be equipped with a non  standard hopf algebra star structure .    the idea to find a quantum poincar group from @xmath1 is not new :",
    "already in @xcite , the so  called @xmath15poincar group was constructed by a contraction of @xmath1 .",
    "this contraction however essentially takes @xmath16 ( in a nontrivial way ) and destroys the properties of the representations which we emphasize , in particular the finite dimensionality .",
    "although it is not considered here , we want to mention that there exists a ( space of functions on ) quantum anti  de sitter space on which @xmath0 resp .",
    "@xmath1 operates , with an intrinsic mass parameter @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the `` radius '' of anti  de sitter space ( and the usual minkowski signature for @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we investigate the unitary representations of @xmath0 , and define a truncated tensor product . in section 3 , the most important facts about quantized universal enveloping algebras of higher rank are reviewed . in section 4 , we consider @xmath19 and @xmath1 , determine the structure of the relevant irreducible ( which are finite dimensional ) and investigate which ones are unitarizable .",
    "the truncated tensor product is generalized to the case of @xmath1 .",
    "finally we conclude and look at possible further developments .",
    "we first consider the simplest case of @xmath0 , which is a real form of @xmath20 , the hopf algebra defined by @xcite & = & 2x^ , = [ h ] + ( h ) & = & h1 + 1 h , + ( x^ ) & = & x^ q^h/2 + q^-h/2 x^ , + s(x^+ ) & = & -q x^+ , s(x^- ) = -q^-1 x^- , s(h ) = -h + ( x^ ) & = & ( h ) = 0 where @xmath21 \\equiv [ n]_q = \\frac{q^n - q^{-n}}{q - q^{-1}}$ ] . to talk about a real form of @xmath22 , one has to impose a reality condition , i.e. a star structure , and there may be several possibilities .",
    "since we want the algebra to be implemented by a unitary representation on a hilbert space , the star operation should be an antilinear antihomomorphism of the algebra .",
    "furthermore , we will see that to get finite dimensional unitary representations , @xmath2 must be a root of unity , so @xmath23 . only at roots of unity",
    "the representation theory of quantum groups differs essentially from the classical case , and new features such as finite dimensional unitary representations of noncompact groups can appear .",
    "this suggests the following star structure corresponding to @xmath0 : h^ = h , ( x^+)^ = -x^- [ star_sl2 ] whis is simply x^ = e^-ih/2 ( x^c.c . )",
    "e^ih/2 [ invol_help ] where @xmath24 is the usual ( linear ) cartan  weyl involution and @xmath25 is the complex conjugate of @xmath26 . since @xmath2 is a phase , @xmath27 , and ( ( x))^ = ( x^ ) provided ( a b)^ = b^ a^.

    "is chosen as e.g. in @xcite , which is different from the standard definition . nevertheless , this is perfectly consistent with a many  particle interpretation in quantum mechanics or quantum field theory as discussed in @xcite , where it is shown e.g. how to define an invariant inner product on the tensor product with the `` correct '' classical limit .",
    "the irreps of @xmath29 at roots of unity are well known ( see e.g. @xcite , whose notations we largely follow ) , and we list some facts . let q = e^2 i",
    "n / m for positive relatively prime integers @xmath30 and define @xmath31 if @xmath32 is odd , and @xmath33 if @xmath32 is even . then it is consistent and appropriate in our context to set ( x^)^m = 0 ( if one uses @xmath34 instead of @xmath35 , then @xmath36 is central ) .",
    "all finite dimensional irreps are highest weight ( h.w . )",
    "representations with dimension @xmath37 .",
    "there are two types of irreps :    * @xmath38 with dimension @xmath39 , for any @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 * @xmath43 with dimension @xmath4 and h.w .",
    "@xmath44 , for @xmath45 .    note that in the second type , @xmath41 is allowed , in which case we will write @xmath46 for convenience .",
    "we will concentrate on the @xmath47  from now on .",
    "furthermore , the fusion rules at roots of unity state that @xmath48 decomposes into @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the well  known reducible , but indecomposable representations of dimension @xmath51 , see figure [ fig : indecomp ] and @xcite .",
    "if @xmath2 is _ not _ a root of unity , then the universal @xmath52 given by = q^12 h h_l=0^ q^-12 l(l+1 ) q^l h/2(x^+)^l q^-l h/2 ( x^-)^l [ univ_r ] defines the quasitriangular structure of @xmath29 .",
