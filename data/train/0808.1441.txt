    "the former presence of short - lived radionuclides ( slrs ) in the early solar system ( @xmath7be , @xmath1al , @xmath8cl , @xmath2ca , @xmath3mn , @xmath4fe , @xmath9pd , @xmath10i , and @xmath11hf ) has been inferred from excesses in the abundances of their daughter nuclides in meteorites , linearly correlated with the abundance of a parent element ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". these now - extinct slrs may provide high - resolution ( @xmath00.1 million years ( myr ) ) chronometers for events that occurred during the first several million years of solar system evolution and may also be potential heat sources for asteroidal metamorphism and/or differentiation .",
    "the slrs with relatively long mean - lives such as @xmath9pd , @xmath10i , @xmath11hf , and perhaps @xmath3mn may have been products of steady - state nucleosynthesis in the galaxy @xcite , while those with mean - lives ( @xmath12 ) of @xmath05 myr , @xmath7be ( @xmath12=2.2 myr ) , @xmath1al ( @xmath12=1.03 myr ) , @xmath8cl ( @xmath12=0.43 myr ) , @xmath2ca ( @xmath12=0.15 myr ) , @xmath4fe ( @xmath12=2.2 myr ) , and possibly @xmath3mn ( @xmath12=5.3 myr ) , should have been produced either by energetic - particle irradiation in the early solar system or by stellar nucleosynthesis just prior to or shortly after the birth of the solar system .",
    "beryllium-10 , which was found in cais ( calcium - aluminum - rich inclusions ) ( mckeegan et al . , 2000 ) , is not produced by stellar nucleosynthesis , but can be efficiently formed by energetic particle irradiation . on the other hand , @xmath4fe , the abundance of which in the early solar system also appears to require a late addition @xcite , can be efficiently produced only in stars .",
    "thus , the presence of @xmath7be and @xmath4fe in the early solar system suggests that both energetic particle irradiation and stellar nucleosynthesis make contributions to the inventories of solar system slrs .",
    "however , it is not clear yet which process contributed more significantly to the inventory of the slrs that could be synthesized by both processes , such as @xmath1al , @xmath8cl , @xmath2ca , and @xmath3mn .",
    "there have been several attempts to find a plausible stellar source(s ) for the abundances of slrs in the early solar system .",
    "a low - mass ( 1.5 m@xmath13 ) thermally - pulsing asymptotic - giant - branch ( tp - agb ) star can not produce enough @xmath4fe to match the initial abundance of @xmath4fe in the solar system ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "models for intermediate - mass agb stars ( 5 m@xmath13 with the solar metallicity or 3 m@xmath13 with 1/3 @xmath14 the solar metallicity ) could explain the inferred solar system abundance of @xmath4fe as well as the abundances of @xmath1al , @xmath2ca and @xmath9pd @xcite .",
    "however , the probability of encounters between molecular clouds and agb stars seems to be extremely low @xcite , implying that an agb star was an unlikely source of slrs in the solar system .",
    "mass - loss winds from wolf - rayet stars may have been a source of the solar system @xmath1al , @xmath8cl , @xmath2ca , and @xmath9pd if the nuclides were incorporated into the solar system within a time - interval of @xmath510@xmath15 year after production @xcite .",
    "however , a wr wind alone would not contain enough @xmath4fe and @xmath3mn to explain their solar system initial abundances @xcite .",
    "type ii core - collapse supernovae have also been considered as plausible sources for slrs .",
    "however , most supernova models imply that if a supernova provided @xmath1al and @xmath2ca into the solar system , it would also supply 10 - 100 times more @xmath3mn than its estimated initial abundance in the solar system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "this discrepancy could be explained by fallback of the innermost layers containing most of the @xmath3mn onto a collapsing stellar core @xcite .",
    "in such a case , @xmath3mn could primarily be derived from a different source such as the interstellar medium . @xcite",
    "proposed that @xmath3mn and possibly @xmath4fe were injected into the solar system as supernova ejecta with a time - interval of @xmath510@xmath16 years after production , long enough for @xmath2ca and @xmath1al to decay completely , and that @xmath1al and @xmath2ca in the solar system may have been produced either by energetic particle irradiation or by an agb star .",
    "another problem with supernovae as sources of slrs is overproduction of @xmath4fe if all the @xmath1al in the solar system was derived from supernovae .",
    "although the yield of @xmath4fe depends the mass loss and initial mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the expected amount of @xmath4fe injected from a supernova would be , in general , a few times higher than its highest estimate for the early solar system , as we will show later .",
    "this problem may still remain even in models for fallback supernovae .    in this study",
    ", we propose a supernova with mixing and fallback , with a kinetic energy of explosion slightly less than that for a typical supernova ( @xmath510@xmath17 erg ) as a potential source of @xmath1al , @xmath2ca , @xmath3mn , and @xmath4fe in the early solar system .",
    "faint supernovae such as sn1997d and sn1999br have such kinetic energies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in models for supernovae with mixing - fallback , the inner region of the exploding star experiences mixing",
    ", some fraction of mixed materials is ejected , and the rest undergoes fallback onto the core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nucleosynthesis in a faint supernova with mixing - fallback successfully reproduces the elemental abundance patterns of hyper metal - poor stars @xcite .",
    "the abundance of a slr injected into preexisting solar system materials can be expressed as follows , assuming that injected materials are well - mixed with preexisting materials ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . :    @xmath18    where _ _ n__@xmath19 and _ _ n__@xmath20 are the numbers of slr and a stable isotope ( si ) for the initial solar system , respectively .",
    "time - zero for the solar system is , in practice , considered to be the time of formation of cais , the oldest solid materials formed in the solar system . _ _ n__@xmath21 and _ _ n__@xmath22 are the numbers of slr and si at the time of their production , respectively . _",
    "_ n__@xmath23 is the number of si in the preexisting solar system materials .",
    "we obtained _",
    "_ n__@xmath21 and _ _",
    "n__@xmath22 for supernovae with mixing - fallback based on nucleosynthesis models by nomoto et al .",
    "their values depend on variable parameters for mixing - fallback such as the scale of the mixing region and an ejection efficiency of mixed materials .",
    "details of determination of _ _ n__@xmath21 and _ _ n__@xmath22 ejecta in the context of a mixing - fallback model are shown below . _ _ n__@xmath21 and _ _ n__@xmath22 were also obtained for non - fallback and fallback supernovae using nucleosynthesis models by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for comparison . _ _",
    "n__@xmath23 was taken from @xcite .",
    "the variables _ _ f__@xmath24 and @xmath25 are free parameters in the injection model representing a dilution factor for supernova ejecta mixed with the preexisting materials and the time interval between the production of slr and the cai formation , respectively .",
    "in the standard model for a supernova almost all the materials are ejected , but materials in the very inner - most region , which is typically deeper than the incomplete si - burning layer , fall back onto the star . in the model for a supernova with fallback @xcite ,",
    "such a mass - cut boundary was moved out to the incomplete si - burning layer or even out to the c / o burning layer , which resulted in suppressed ejection of @xmath3mn .    in the model for a supernova with mixing - fallback ,",
    "we assume two mass - cut boundaries at different depths of a pre - supernova star .",
    "the deeper boundary is defined as the initial mass - cut boundary ( _ _ m__@xmath26 ) corresponding to the mass - cut boundary in previous models .",
    "the shallower boundary is defined as the outer boundary of the mixing region ( _ _ m__@xmath27 ) , which is considered to be the volume between _",
    "_ m__@xmath26 and _ _ m__@xmath27 .",
    "most of materials in the region between _ _ m__@xmath26 and _ _ m__@xmath27 fallback onto the core by gravity after complete mixing by rayleigh - taylor instabilities , but a small fraction ( _ q _ ) of homogeneously - mixed materials is ejected from the mixing region .",
    "thus , in the present model , supernova ejecta consist of all the nuclides from the region outside of _ _ m__@xmath27 and a fraction _ q _ of nuclides within the mixing region between _ _ m__@xmath26 and _ _ m__@xmath27 .    two mass - cut boundaries ( _ _ m__@xmath26 and _ _ m__@xmath27 ) and the fraction of materials ejected from the mixing region ( _ q _ ) are essential parameters to determine _ _ n__@xmath21 and _ _ n__@xmath22 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the kinetic energies of explosion of faint supernovae ( sn1997d and sn1999br ) are estimated to be @xmath5(0.4 - 0.6)@xmath1410@xmath17 erg , which is @xmath51/3 to 1/2 times smaller than the typical kinetic energy of supernova explosion .",
    "however , an explosion with slightly less kinetic energy does not significantly affect explosive nucleosyntheses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus we evaluated _",
    "_ n__@xmath21 and _ _ n__@xmath22 with different sets of ( _ _ m__@xmath26 , _ _ m__@xmath27 and _ q _ based on a nucleosynthesis model for a solar - metallicity massive star with the kinetic energy of explosion of 10@xmath17 erg ( fig . 1 ; @xcite ) .    regarding _ _",
    "m__@xmath26 , the initial mass - cut within the incomplete si - burning layer suppresses the ejection of @xmath3mn as discussed in fallback supernova models @xcite .",
    "although a proper choice of _",
    "_ m__@xmath26 in the narrow incomplete si - burning layer may explain the amounts of slrs in the solar system including @xmath3mn , very precise tuning of the model is required . in the present study , we varied _ _",

    "f__@xmath24 is estimated to be much smaller than 1 , and the change of _",
    "_ n__@xmath28 due to change of the initial mass cut has almost no effects on the following discussion .",
    "we will show results for _ _ m__@xmath26 placed at the boundary of the iron core , where peak temperatures are ( 10 - 8.5)@xmath1410@xmath29k .    the position of the outer boundary of the mixing region , _ _",
    "m__@xmath27 , was varied from within the incomplete si - burning layer to the bottom of h - burning shell , and the ejection fraction , _ q _ , was given values between 10@xmath6 - 10@xmath30 .",
    "note that _",
    "_ m__@xmath27 and _ q _ were required to be within the c / o - burning region or the he - burning region and @xmath510@xmath6 , respectively , to explain the elemental abundances of hyper metal - poor stars ( he0107 - 5240 and he1327 - 2326 ) by a faint supernova @xcite .",
    "the upper limit of _ q _ was determined so that the yield of @xmath31ni did not to exceed those for faint supernovae ( @xmath510@xmath32 m@xmath13 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we determined _",
    "_ f__@xmath24 and @xmath25 to minimize deviations of modeled abundances of @xmath1al , @xmath2ca , @xmath3mn , and @xmath4fe ( see eq.(1 ) ) from their estimated initial abundances in the early solar system ; @xmath1al/@xmath33al = ( 5.0@xmath340.5)@xmath1410@xmath35 , @xmath2ca/@xmath36ca = ( 1.4@xmath340.14)@xmath1410@xmath37 , @xmath3mn/@xmath38mn = ( 9@xmath344.5)@xmath1410@xmath39 , and @xmath4fe/@xmath31fe = ( 7.5@xmath342.5)@xmath1410@xmath40 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because the initial abundances of @xmath3mn and @xmath4fe have not been well determined yet , we chose plausible abundances for them and gave larger uncertainties than for @xmath1al and @xmath2ca based on ranges of reported initial abundances . note that the choice of plausible initial abundances for @xmath3mn and @xmath4fe did not have a significant effect on the following discussion .",
    "the uncertainties for the initial abundances were used as weights for minimization of _",

    "minimization was done in wide varieties of _ _ f__@xmath24 and @xmath25 , of which typical steps were 5 % and 100 years for _ _ f__@xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , and we confirmed that the grand minimum was obtained .",
    "calculated initial abundances of @xmath1al , @xmath2ca , @xmath3mn , and @xmath4fe normalized to meteoritic initial abundances for non - fallback supernovae are shown in figure 2a - d as a function of the mass of the exploding star .",
    "the dilution factor , _ _",
    "f__@xmath24 , is estimated to be in the range of ( 0.5 - 6)@xmath1410@xmath6 , and typical time - interval , @xmath25 , is @xmath5 0.7 myr . as seen in previous studies , @xmath3mn and @xmath4fe",
    "are , in general , overproduced compared to other slrs , respectively , irrespective of nucleosynthesis models .",
    "figure 2e shows the case for fallback models based on the nucleosynthesis model of @xcite with no mixing , where the amounts of @xmath3mn are much less than that expected in the early solar system ( after @xcite ) . as mentioned above ,",
    "if the mass cut occurs within a narrow incomplete si - burning layer , it might be possible to explain all the slrs discussed here with fallback supernovae .",
    "however , it requires fine tuning of the mass cut region within the layer .",
    "thus the general consequences of fallback supernova models seems to be very little ejection of @xmath3mn .",
    "the abundances of slrs estimated for faint supernova of different masses with mixing - fallback are shown in figure 3 as a function of _",
    "_ m__@xmath27 and _ q_. it is clearly seen that injection of @xmath3mn and @xmath4fe is suppressed and the abundances of slrs agree with their solar system abundances as long as the outer boundary of mixing region is located in the c / o - burning layer , where peak temperatures of the shock wave range from @xmath54@xmath1410@xmath41 to @xmath54@xmath1410@xmath29 k. on the other hand , the modeled abundances of slrs can not explain the solar system values if _ _ m__@xmath27 is located in the si - burning or he - burning layers .",
    "@xcite proposed that the outer boundary of the mixing layer could be in the upper c / o - burning region or at the bottom of the he - burning layer to explain the elemental abundances of hyper metal - poor stars , he0107 - 5240 and he1327 - 2326 , respectively .",
    "the former case is consistent with _ _ m__@xmath27 required to explain the solar system slrs .",
    "it should be noted here again that the results shown here are not affected by the choice of the initial mass cut(__m__@xmath26 ) as long as it occurs in the region deeper than the incomplete si - burning layer .",
    "the obtained _ _ f__@xmath24 and @xmath25 increase from 7@xmath1410@xmath35 to 2@xmath1410@xmath32 and from 0.8 to 1.1 myr , respectively , with increasing _ _",

    "it should be emphasized here that a narrow range of mixing - fallback parameters ( _ _ m__@xmath27 and _ q _ ) is not required to match the solar system abundances of slrs .",
    "the overall agreement of calculated abundances with meteoritic values can be obtained for wide ranges of _ _ m__@xmath27 and _ q _ ( fig .",
    "3 ) , a major advantage of this model compared to the simple fallback supernova models .",
    "previous supernova models , which attempted to explain the initial abundances of solar system slrs , had the problems of over - injection of @xmath3mn and @xmath4fe compared to @xmath1al and @xmath2ca .",
    "such problems can be solved in the faint supernova model with mixing - fallback with the following reasons .",
    "manganese-53 is synthesized mainly in the incomplete si - burning layer , while @xmath1al , @xmath2ca , and @xmath4fe are produced more abundantly in outer regions ( fig .",
    "although a small fraction of the @xmath3mn is ejected , most falls back only to the collapsing core when the outer region of the mixing layer is located in the c / o - burning layer . on the other hand ,",
    "some fractions of other slrs , produced outside of the mixing layer , are ejected without experiencing the mixing - fallback .",
    "together , these features suppress the amount of @xmath3mn injected into the solar system materials compared to other slrs .",
    "aluminum-26 is the only nuclide , among slrs considered in this study , that forms abundantly in the he and h layers and the explosive o - burning layer of a massive star with the solar metallicity .",
    "if the oute r boundary of the mixing region is located in the c / o layer , more than 80 % of @xmath1al should have its origin in the he and h layers .",
    "this is because @xmath1al in the c / o layer was destroyed by the he burning ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and most of @xmath1al in the explosive o - buring layer falls back onto the central remnant .",
    "the amount of @xmath1al in the supernova ejecta is thus less affected by the mixing - fallback process , which lowers the @xmath4fe/@xmath1al ratio .",
    "aluminum-26 may be ejected in a mass - loss wind before the supernova explosion , which may explain the possible time interval between @xmath4fe- and @xmath1al - injection @xcite .",
    "we conclude that @xmath1al , @xmath2ca , @xmath3mn , and @xmath4fe in the early solar system could have been brought from a single massive star that experienced a less - energetic supernova explosion",
    ". the estimated dilution factor , _ _",
    "f__@xmath24 , may provide a geometric constraint on the supernova and the solar system materials as discussed by @xcite . assuming the spherical symmetric ejection from the supernova , _",
    "_ f__@xmath24 can be basically expressed by an injection efficiency of ejecta into the solar system materials ( @xmath42 ) and a solid angle ( @xmath43 ) of the solar system materials ( a proto - solar molecular cloud core or a proto solar system disk ) on a sphere of ejecta with a radius corresponding to the distance ( _ d _ ) between the supernova and the solar system materials .",
    "if ejecta are injected into the molecular cloud core ( 0.1 pc in radius , 1 m@xmath13 in mass , and @xmath42 of 0.1 @xcite ) , _ d _ is estimated to be @xmath52 - 5 pc . in the case of injection into the proto solar system disk as discussed in @xcite ( 100 au in radius , 0.01 m@xmath13 in mass , and @xmath42 of 1 ) , _ d _ of @xmath50.3 - 0.8 pc was obtained .",
    "it is difficult to evaluate which case is more plausible for the solar system forming environment at present .",
    "however , in either case , the supernova explosion should have occurred nearby the solar system materials , which supports the idea of the birth of the solar system in a star - cluster containing massive stars .",
    "the lifetime of the star cluster is several to 10 myr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , within which only massive stars ( @xmath4420 - 25 m@xmath13 ) explode .",
    "the proportion of massive stars in a cluster is low ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus it may be highly unlikely that multiple supernovae brought slrs into the solar system materials within a lifetime of the star cluster . in the model for a faint supernova with mixing - fallback , solar system slrs with mean lives of @xmath05 myr can be from a single supernova .",

    "<S> the modeled slr abundances agree well with their solar system abundances if mixing - fallback occurs within the c / o - burning layer . in some cases , </S>",
    "<S> the initial solar system abundances of the slrs can be reproduced within a factor of 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the dilution factor of supernova ejecta to the solar system materials is @xmath510@xmath6 and the time interval between the supernova explosion and the formation of oldest solid materials in the solar system is @xmath51 myr . </S>",
    "<S> if the dilution occurred due to spherically symmetric expansion , a faint supernova should have occurred nearby the solar system forming region in a star cluster . </S>"
