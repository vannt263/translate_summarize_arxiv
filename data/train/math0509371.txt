    "we consider the infinite - source poisson process with random transmission rate defined by @xmath1 where the arrival times @xmath2 are the points of a unit - rate homogeneous poisson process on the positive half - line , independent of the initial conditions ; and the durations and transmission rates @xmath3 are independent and identically distributed random variables with values in @xmath4 and independent of the poisson process and of the initial conditions .",
    "this process was considered by resnick and rootzn @xcite and mikosch _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , among others .",
    "the @xmath0 queue is a special case , for @xmath5 .",
    "an important motivation for the infinite - source poisson process is to model the instantaneous rate of the workload going though an internet link .",
    "although overly simple models are generally not relevant for internet traffic at the packet level , it is generally admitted that rather simple models can be used for higher - level ( the so - called _ flow level _ ) traffic such as tcp or http sessions , one of them being the infinite - source poisson process ( see barakat _",
    "one way to empirically analyse internet traffic at the flow level using the infinite - source poisson process would consist in retrieving all the variables @xmath6 involved in the observed traffic during a given period of time , but this would require the collection of all the relevant information in the packets headers ( such as source and destination addresses ) for the purpose of separating the aggregated workload into transmission rates at a pertinent level ; see duffield _",

    "it is well known that heavy tails in the durations @xmath7 result in long - range dependence of the process @xmath8 .",
    "long - range dependence can be defined by the regular variation of the autocovariance of the process or more generally by the regular variation of the variance of the integrated process : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a slowly varying function at infinity and @xmath11 is often refered to as the _ hurst index _ of the process . for the infinite - source poisson process , the hurst index @xmath12 is related to the tail index @xmath13 of the durations by the relation @xmath14 .",
    "the long - range dependence property has motivated many empirical studies of internet traffic and theoretical ones concerning its impact on queuing ( these questions are studied in the @xmath0 case in parulekar and makowki @xcite ) .    however , to the best of our knowledge , no statistical procedure to estimate @xmath12 has been rigorously justified .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to propose an estimator of the hurst index of the infinite - source poisson process , and to derive its statistical properties .",
    "we propose to estimate @xmath12 ( or equivalently @xmath13 ) from a path of the process @xmath8 over a finite interval @xmath15 $ ] , observed either continuously or discretely . in practice",
    "this can be done by counting all the packets going through some point of the network and then collecting local traffic rate measurements .",
    "our estimator is based on the so - called wavelet coefficients of a path .",
    "there is a wide literature on this methodology for estimating long - range dependence , starting as long ago as wornell and oppenheim @xcite , but we are not aware of rigorous results for non - gaussian or non - stable processes .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is thus the proof of the consistency of our estimator .",
    "we also investigate the rate of convergence of the estimator in the case @xmath16 .",
    "if the process is observed continuously , the rate of convergence is good . in the case of discrete observations ,",
    "the rate is much smaller .",
    "also , the choice of the tuning parameters of the estimators is much more restricted in the latter case , and practitioners should perhaps be aware of this ; see section  [ sec : rate - conv - stable ] for details .    the process @xmath17 is formally defined in section  [ sec : basic - prop - model ] .",
    "we state our assumptions and , using a point - process representation of @xmath17 , we establish some of its main properties .",

    "lemma  [ lem : momentbetadj ] implies that @xmath353 has the same order of magnitude as @xmath316 , so that the stochastic fluctuation term has the same order of magnitude as in the previous case .",
    "the difference comes from the bias term , which is @xmath354 .",

    "in this work , we have proved the validity of a wavelet method for the estimation of the long - memory parameter of an infinite - source poisson traffic model , either in a stable or in an unstable state , that is , when it does or does not converge to a stationary process .",
    "we have shown that a suitable choice of the scales in the estimator ( see remark  [ rem : universalestimator ] ) yields a consistent estimator in both situations , and checked that the estimator is robust to discrete data sampling .",
    "however , the study of the rates raises some questions concerning the optimality of this estimator . to draw a comparison ,",

    "then one can use the hill estimator for estimating the tail index @xmath13 . since @xmath138 and @xmath359 are asymptotically proportional and @xmath357 are independent and identically distributed , the rates of this estimator are those derived in hall and welsh @xcite .",
    "in particular , if @xmath45 has a pareto distribution , then a parametric rate @xmath360 can be obtained . on the other hand , in the same situation",
    ", our wavelet estimator defined on the observations @xmath361\\}$ ] has a dramatically deteriorating rate for @xmath13 close to 2 .",
    "it remains to establish whether this discrepancy comes from the choice of the estimator or from the fact that the durations @xmath362 are not directly observed .",
    "finally , let us draw a practical conclusion from our study .",
    "care precaution should be taken with the choice of the scales used in the estimation , as shown by the conditions on @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "in particular , if only discrete observations are available , the best possible rate of convergence is obtained for a much larger value of @xmath208 than if continous observations are available .",
    "too small a value of @xmath208 will induce an important bias for finite samples .",
