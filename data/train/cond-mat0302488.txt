    "discovery of superconductivity near 40 k in mgb@xmath5,@xcite and the rapid development in the understanding of the microscopic mechanism ( a specific type of electron - phonon coupling ) has spurred extensive work on its properties and the discovery of closely related materials .",
    "interest in libc and its li - deficient derivatives has been spurred by calculational evidence@xcite that the electron - phonon coupling will be stronger , and consequently the superconducting transition temperature is expected to be higher , than mgb@xmath5 .",

    "we will return below to discussion of the implications of the raman and ir data for the vibrational properties of libc .",
    "as for possible doping ( de - intercalation of li ) , all of these reports are probably consistent with very low doping , too low to drive the material conducting ( in spite of the broad bands that promote doped - hole conduction ) .",
    "the susceptibility data indicate small concentrations of local moments , typical of semiconductors with point defects .",
    "zhao , klavins , and liu , in their efforts at li de - intercalation , observed evaporation of li upon vacuum annealing , with no sign of superconductivity in the annealed samples.@xcite the amount of li remaining in the sample has not yet been characterized , however ( xrays are not sensitive enough ) , so definitive results remain to be obtained .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to obtain in more detail the character of the intrinsic ( insulating ) phase of libc .",

    "we find much more interestng behavior , however ; z@xmath10 and z@xmath9 are of opposite sign , and large  they behave like strongly charged cation and anion , respectively .",
    "we analyze this behavior , and also comment on the possible relevance this behavior has for the difficulty in de - intercalating li from libc , and also for c doping in mgb@xmath13c@xmath14 .",
    "the calculations were carried using the abinit code with troullier - martins pseudopotentials@xcite , teter parametrization@xcite of the ceperley - alder exchange - correlation potential , and 216 @xmath15-points in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone .",

    "the b and c atoms form a flat graphene sheet , with b and c atoms alternating around each hexagonal unit .",
    "the stacking of b - c layers is alternating , such that each b has c neighbors along the @xmath19 direction , and similarly for c. this stacking , which doubles the unit cell volume over that of mgb@xmath5 , indicates that b - c bonding along @xmath19 ( to the extent that it occurs ) is preferable to b - b and c - c bonding .",
    "possibly this stacking results in a favorable madelung energy , although real static charges associated with b and c separately are almost impossible to define or calculate .",
    "the li ions lie in the interstitial site ( center of inversion ) between the centers of the hexagonal units above and below , coordinated at equal distances with six b atoms and six c atoms .",
    "the character of the various zone center modes in libc were presented earlier by an _",

    "these differences will be difficult to resolve experimentally .",
    "the calculated raman - active frequencies are in excellent agreement with the data of two groups.@xcite the ir modes remain to be verified and understood .",
    "the spectra are polarization dependent , and the spectra presented by pronin _",
    "et al._@xcite and by bharathi _",
    "et al._@xcite are not representative of pure polarization data .    since it will be useful for comparison with single crystal data , in fig .",
    "2 we present our predicted reflectivity @xmath51 spectrum for both in - plane and perpendicular polarization .",
    "the damping ( which for a clean undoped sample would be due to anharmonicity ) has been chosen for each mode to be 3% of the frequency ( zero damping curves are not very representative ) . if the damping is not too large , and there is no reason to expect large anharmonicity in libc , then both to and lo frequencies can be obtained with small uncertainty .",
    "it was mentioned in the introduction that calculations have indicated that , if partial li removal can be achieved , li@xmath52bc should be a very good superconductor .",
    "such li extraction is common in many materials , being the process that forms the basis for li batteries .",
    "what our studies here have shown is that ( primarily for @xmath19 axis displacements ) li shows considerable covalency with the b - c layer , with li - c coupling being the prominent feature .",
    "this partial li covalency is probably connected with the difficulty that several groups have found@xcite in de - intercalating it from the libc lattice .",
    "in addition , cava , zandbergen , and inumaru reported briefly that libc seems to be highly resistant to chemical doping.@xcite    the finding here that c is very different chemically from b in this system also carries some implications for c replacement of b in mgb@xmath5 .",
    "recent studies confirm that about 10% of b can be replaced with c while retaining the structure , and the superconducting transition temperature remains high ( t@xmath53=22 k).@xcite if c alloying in the b sublattice were rigid band like , the additional 0.1 electron per cell would nearly fill the important @xmath54 bands@xcite that are responsible for superconductivity , and t@xmath53 would be expected to vanish ( or nearly so ) .",
    "the great difference between c and b behavior in libc reflects strong differences in bonding , and suggests something very different from rigid band `` doping . ''",
    "preliminary calculations for mgb@xmath13c@xmath14 ( ordered supercells and virtual crystal)@xcite indeed indicate substantial non - rigid - band behavior : c is really different from `` b with an extra electron . ''",
    "although calculations such as those described here have been found in several systems to be accurate , it is highly desirable to obtain polarized single crystal ir data to confirm our predictions .",
