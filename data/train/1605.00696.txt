    "the presence of ferromagnetic impurity atoms deposited on top of an @xmath0-wave superconductor with strong rashba spin - orbit interaction  @xcite , gives rise to the following effective hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath1 modelled on a 2d square lattice . here",

    "we measure energy in units of @xmath13 .",
    "the presence of the magnetic impurity atoms is modelled by a zeeman spin - splitting @xmath14 being induced in the superconductor , which is only finite at the impurity sites , indicated in fig .",

    "clear zero - energy peaks are observed on site 2 , 3 , and 6 - 9 ( black lines ) .",
    "all of these corresponds to junctions with an odd number of wire segments or single wire end points , henceforth named odd junctions .",
    "in contrast , no zero energy peaks are observed on sites 1 , 4 , and 5 ( red lines ) , which corresponds to junctions with an even number of wire segments , or simply even junctions .",
    "this clear - cut distinction between even and odd junctions can be understood from the requirement that an even number of majorana fermions have to be present in any condensed matter system : first , consider a system with a single multi - wire junction . in this case",
    "the number of wire end - points is even or odd , depending on whether the junction is even or odd .",
    "thus for an odd junction one majorana fermion has to appear somewhere else than at the end - points .",
    "that this remaining majorana fermion appears at the junction is clear when considering the junction as being created by bringing several end - points together .",
    "then pairs of majorana fermions are able to hybridize and can thus split in energy at the junction . in total",
    ", this leaves at least one unpaired majorana at the junction whenever the number of incoming wires is odd .",
    "now , as long as the wire segments are long enough , the local physics at a certain junction should not depend on whether an incoming wire segment truly terminates in a single end - point or in another junction .",
    "it is therefore expected that majorana fermions appear at odd junctions in a wire network .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "[ figure : ldos ] shows that at even junctions , both 2- and 4-wire junctions , the original wire end - point states significantly hybridize , leaving no low - lying energy states and not even any states notably separated from the remaining quasiparticle impurity bands .",
    "next we note that the zero - energy peaks at site 2 and 8 , corresponding to junctions between three wire segments , are notably smaller than the peaks at wire end - points . clearly",
    ", majorana fermions at wire end - points can only spread along the wire network in a single direction , while the majorana fermions at three - wire junctions can spread along all three directions .",
    "smaller peaks are therefore natural due to the majorana fermions being localized over a larger region .",
    "also , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ figure : ldosfull](a ) , the ldos peak at the actual junction atom is also a bit smaller because the majorana fermion in fact has its highest density on the neighboring sites .",
    "( thin lines ) and on the bulk site b ( thick blue lines ) .",
    "zero - energy peaks are seen on sites 2 , 3 , and 6 - 9 ( black ) , while such peaks are absent on sites 1 , 4 , and 5 ( red ) .",
    "the parameters are here @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , which puts the wires comfortably within the topological phase . ]",
    "having seen that majorana fermions appear only at odd junctions , we move on to discuss the other intragap states . for odd junctions",
    "they determine the excitation gap , which is important if the majorana fermions are to be used for storing information .",
    "further , the intra gap states at even junctions sets the energy scale needed for resolving the difference between even and odd junctions , important for providing evidence of majorana fermions . to study all types of intragap states we plot in fig .",
    "[ figure : ldosfull ] the ldos along the whole wire segment from point 1 to 3 , spanning , wire - end , 2- , and 3-wire junctions .",
    "there is a continuum of intragap states along the whole wire segment , stretching about halfway into the gap @xmath23 and with relatively little variation in the band bottom energy .",
    "there exists also at the even - junction two intragap states slightly below this continuum , but their energies are not notably separated from the continuum band bottom along the wire segment as a whole .",
    "these states are also well - localized , revealing them being strongly hybridized wire - end points majorana states .",
    "( a ) and as function of energy ( b ) .",
    "white ripples along the energy direction in the otherwise empty region ( blue ) are due to the truncation of the chebyshev expansion , and not due to additional states , and can be understood as gibbs oscillations .",
    "they are only visible due to a logarithmic color scale ( cp .  to fig .",
    "[ figure : ldos ] plotted without logarithmic scale ) .",
    "same parameters as for fig .",
    "[ figure : ldos ] ]    .",
    "[ figure : ldosfull ]    to thoroughly investigate the behavior of the intragap states over a wide parameter range , we also study the ldos at both the even junction 1 and the odd junction 2 as a function of varying rashba spin - orbit interaction and magnetic impurity strength .",
    "the variation with the other two parameters , chemical potential and superconducting order parameter , is much simpler and reported in the supplementary material .",
    "in fig .  [ figure : ldos_alpha_junction_3 ] we plot the ldos at sites 1 and 2 for a sequence of different spin - orbit coupling strengths @xmath11 .",
    "it is clear that the energy gap depends fairly linearly on the strength of the rashba spin - orbit interaction .",
    "it is also clear that the majorana fermions at the odd junction push the intragap states to notably higher energies , creating a larger excitation gap . for the even junction",
    "the gap is somewhat smaller .",

    "guidelines ( red ) indicate the lowest energy of the intragap states . ]    to understand why the rashba spin - orbit interaction opens up an energy gap it is instructive to consider what happens in the absence of rashba spin - orbit interaction , and for small magnetic impurity strengths",
    ". however , in the absence of both rashba spin - orbit interaction and zeeman spin - splitting , the chemical potential natural for studying topological superconductivity corresponds to a fermi level close to band edge of the normal state hamiltonian . to remedy this problem and be able to study what happens as one term after another",
    "is turned on , we for a moment shift the chemical potential back firmly into the band of the normal state hamiltonian , choosing @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting model is not in the topologically non - trivial phase , but the intragap bands are a very general feature",
    ".    it is well known that a single magnetic impurity in an @xmath0-wave superconductor gives rise to localized yu - shiba - rusinov ( ysr ) states inside the superconducting gap  @xcite .",
    "a chain of such impurities therefore give rise to what can be dubbed ysr bands . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figure : ldosnormalwire ] we plot the spin - polarized ldos in the middle of a long ferromagnetic impurity wire embedded in an @xmath0-wave superconductor without rashba coupling , as well as the bulk ldos in the absence of impurities .",
    "it is clear that the ysr bands are strongly spin - polarized , with spin - up electrons entering the energy gap from above , and spin down electrons entering from below , since the zeeman spin - splitting term favors spin - up electrons in eq .",
    "[ equation : tight_binding_hamiltonian ] . with increasing zeeman spin - splitting ,",
    "the intragap bands eventually starts to overlap , but the spin - up and down states are still independent of each other .",

    "the opening of an energy gap facilitated by the spin - orbit term can also be understood from the band structure of a 1d ferromagnetic and superconducting wire . as discussed in the supplementary material",
    ", the spin - orbit interaction only opens a gap in the presence of a superconducting order parameter .",
    "in particular , this explains why the spin - orbit interaction pushes the ysr bands away from the fermi level .",
    "the rashba term itself has no preference for hybridizing energy levels more strongly around the fermi level , but superconductivity clearly has .",
    "we have already seen how the zeeman spin - splitting in the absence of rashba spin - orbit interaction affects the intragap states by pulling them through the gap .",
    "next we consider the effect of the zeeman spin - splitting in the presence of all other terms . in fig .",
    "[ figure : ldos_vz_junction_3 ] we plot the ldos at sites 1 and 2 for a sequence of different @xmath15 .",

    "lines are drawn with increasing offset with @xmath31 for the bottom line .",
    "guidelines ( red ) indicate the lowest energies of the intragap states . ]",
    "this can be understood as a consequence of the dependence of the band structure on the zeeman spin - splitting and the topological phase transition that the system goes through as @xmath15 is varied .",
    "the topological phase transition occurs as the band gap closes at @xmath32 ( along the wire ) , see supplementary material . however , far away from the topological phase transition the gap is smallest at finite @xmath33 , where it is instead opened by the rashba spin - orbit interaction , see supplementary material .",
    "both of these band edges therefore gives rise to signatures in the ldos .",
    "as indicated by the cross shaped guide lines in fig .",
    "[ figure : ldos_vz_junction_3 ] , a rapid decrease of the energy gap first occurs as the zeeman spin - splitting is turned on , until the topological phase transition occurs at the crossing point . after the phase transition , this gap at @xmath32 increases again and eventually becomes too large to give any clear signature in the ldos , as indicated by the terminated cross shaped lines .",
    "in addition , another set of intragap states can also be identified , which follows the first type of intragap states but at a slower rate . however , in contrast to the first type of intragap states , these states continues to move into the gap also after the topological phase transition , albeit at an even slower rate ( see kink approximately at topological phase transition ) .",
    "we also note that fig .",
    "[ figure : ldos_vz_junction_3 ] eliminates any doubt regarding whether the zero energy state at the odd - junction at site 2 truly is a majorana fermion , as it is seen to appear once the topological phase transition has occurred .",
    "figure  [ figure : ldos_vz_junction_3 ] also displays the clear difference between intragap states between even- and odd - junctions for a very wide range of magnetic impurity strengths .",
    "we have studied a wire network of ferromagnetic impurities on the surface of an @xmath0-wave superconductor with strong rashba spin - orbit interaction .",
    "we find that zero - energy majorana fermions not only appear at the end points of individual wires , but also occur at junctions with an odd number of wire segments , while no low - energy states are present in junctions with an even number of wire segments .",
    "this even - odd effect for the appearance of zero - energy states is a unique consequence of their majorana character . both construction and measurements of a wire network should be possible",
    "using existing scanning tunneling technology and would provide evidence for majorana fermions much stronger than measurements on a single wire .",
    "furthermore , we find that the energy gap protecting the majorana fermions in odd - junctions and fully gapping even - junctions , increases notably with larger rashba spin - orbit coupling . by applying an electric field",
    "it might be possible to experimentally tune the strength of the surface rashba spin - orbit coupling . varying the magnetic impurity spin - splitting primarily tunes the topological phase , but has limited influence inside the topological phase .",

    "<S> one prominent system where theory predicts that condensed matter realizations of majorana fermions appear is at the end points of a wire of ferromagnetic atoms deposited on top of an @xmath0-wave superconductor with strong rashba spin - orbit interaction  @xcite , or the physically equivalent setup with magnetic atoms forming a helical magnetic state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) experiments on such a system composed of magnetic fe atoms deposited on pb , which is a conventional @xmath0-wave superconductor with rashba spin - orbit interaction , have observed the first hallmark of majorana fermions ; zero - energy bias peaks in the local density of states ( ldos ) at the wire end points  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , zero - energy states can have multiple origins and might very well not be majorana fermions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , stronger evidence is needed in order to rule out other explanations .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we propose to build a network of wires by using stm to deposit ferromagnetic impurity atoms on a rashba spin - orbit coupled superconductor and find signatures that are clearly distinct to majorana fermion zero - energy states . </S>",
    "<S> we show through realistic numerical calculations that well - localized majorana fermions appear not only at end points of individual wires , but also at junctions between an odd number of wires . </S>",
    "<S> however , at junctions with an even number of wires , there are _ no _ low - lying energy states </S>",
    "<S> .    networks of one - dimensional ( 1d ) topological wires have previously been studied for future majorana fermion braiding  @xcite , but we show that even the plain experimental observation of localized zero - energy states at odd junctions , together with the absence of such states at even junctions , directly provides strong evidence for that the zero - energy states corresponds to majorana fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we further investigate how the energy of the quasiparticle impurity bands depends on all parameters entering the system : rashba spin - orbit interaction , magnetic impurity term , chemical potential , and superconducting order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we verify that in a broad parameter range , there is a large difference in energy between majorana fermions at odd junctions and the lowest - energy quasiparticle impurity states in even junctions . </S>",
    "<S> this reaffirms a wire network as a very promising tool to probe the majorana character of zero - energy states . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the quasiparticle impurity energies also sets the excitation gap protecting the majorana fermions from quasiparticle poisoning in odd junctions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that a large rashba spin - orbit interaction is highly beneficial for a large excitation gap . </S>"
