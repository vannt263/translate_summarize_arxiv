    "in addition , in such a framework , a very light scalar field , called axion , shows up @xcite .",
    "the coherent oscillation of the axion field is a viable candidate of dark matter of our universe if the pq symmetry breaking scale is around @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "thus , the pq mechanism has been attracted many attentions not only from particle - physics point of view but also from cosmology point of view .",
    "if we embed the pq mechanism into the framework of supersymmetry ( susy ) , which is a prominent candidate of the model beyond the standard model , serious cosmological difficulties may show up .",
    "in particular , because of the supersymmetry , there should exist superpartners of the axion , i.e. , axino and saxion .",
    "thermally produced axino and saxion , as well as coherent oscillation of saxion , may significantly affect the evolution of the universe . in order to construct cosmologically viable supersymmetric pq model",
    ", it is important to understand how the axion multiplet affects the thermal history of the universe .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the effect of the saxion on cosmology , paying particular attention to the thermal effects on properties of the saxion . in hadronic axion models",
    "@xcite , axion multiplet couples to extra colored multiplets , which include colored fermions ( called pq fermions ) , to solve the strong cp problem . even in dfsz - type model @xcite in which the ordinary higgses have non - vanishing pq charges , extra colored multiplets are likely to be introduced to avoid domain - wall problem .",
    "the saxion acquires thermal mass of the order of @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 being coupling constant ) when the cosmic temperature @xmath5 is higher than the mass of pq fermions . even if the temperature is lower so that the densities of the pq fermions ( and their scalar partners ) are negligibly small , thermal effect induces logarithmic term in saxion potential @xcite .",
    "these thermal effects shift the minimum of the potential , which may result in too large amplitude of the coherent oscillation of the saxion .",
    "furthermore , the coherent oscillation of the saxion may dissipate via the interaction with hot qcd plasma . taking these effects into account",
    ", we study cosmological history of a susy pq model .",
    "in supersymmetric pq model , there exists supermultiplet @xmath6 ( called `` axion supermultiplet '' ) which includes the axion field .",
    "saxion ( denoted as @xmath7 ) is a real scalar field in the axion multiplet : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are axion and axino , respectively .",

    ", we consider the case that the masses of pq fermions are related to the amplitude of @xmath7 .",
    "the pq fermions become massless when @xmath7 takes a particular value . by integrating out pq fermions , the axion multiplet couples to gauge multiplets ( in particular , that of @xmath12 ) as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the field strength supermultiplet of @xmath12 .",

    "we discuss possible thermal effects on the saxion .",

    ", @xmath38 acquires a new term of @xmath39 . for @xmath40 , on the contrary , @xmath25 and @xmath26 rapidly go to zero .    if the temperature is high enough so that @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the zero - temperature vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath7 , the pq fermions are in thermal bath as relativistic particles even when @xmath43 .",
    "in such a case , the expectation value of @xmath7 is determined by the thermal mass term .",
    "because @xmath44 and @xmath45 are minimized at @xmath46 ( where @xmath47 satisfies @xmath48 ) , we expect only one minimum of the potential at @xmath49 at high enough temperature .",
    "the situation changes when the temperature is lower than @xmath50 .",
    "in such a case , the number densities of @xmath22 are boltzmann suppressed at @xmath43 .",
    "thermal effects are negligible around the zero - temperature minimum and there exist a minimum at @xmath43 .",
    "( effect of the logarithmic thermal correction to the potential @xcite , which affects the position of the minimum , may be sizable .",
    "see the discussion below . ) on the other hand , if @xmath51 is flat enough , the minimum at @xmath49 also remains .",
    "in such a case , there are two distinctive minima of the potential ; even though there exists a minimum at @xmath43 , the scalar field @xmath7 can be thermally trapped in the different minimum close to the symmetry enhanced point .",
    "then , the minimum at @xmath49 disappears when the temperature is so low that the shape of the potential around @xmath49 is determined by the zero - temperature potential .",
    "the saxion potential has another important term which is not taken into account in eq .  .",
    "because the free energy of hot qcd plasma has a contribution proportional to @xmath52 @xcite , and also because @xmath53 depends on @xmath27 ( i.e. , the mass of colored particles ) if @xmath54 , the free energy has the following term @xcitethe logarithmic term is expected to disappear in the region where @xmath27 is smaller than @xmath55 . in such a region , however , @xmath25 and @xmath26 dominate , so the effect of the logarithmic term is not important .",

    ".    the thermally produced axino may be cosmologically harmful @xcite .",

    "( if the saxion starts to oscillate after the reheating , @xmath65 should be replaced by the temperature at which the oscillation starts , and @xmath218 should be identified as the initial amplitude of the saxion oscillation . ) if the oscillation of the saxion starts before the reheating , @xmath221 is related to the initial number density using the fact that @xmath222 during the inflaton - dominated era . denoting the temperature at which the saxion starts to oscillate as @xmath223 ( with @xmath224 ) , @xmath225    to see how large the saxion abundance is , we calculate the following ratio @xmath226 where @xmath227 and @xmath228 are energy densities of the saxion and the radiation from the inflaton decay at the time just before the saxion decay , respectively . if @xmath229 , the saxion dominates the universe . in figs.[fig : mvsftr7 ] and [ fig : mvsftr9 ] , we show contours of constant @xmath230 .",
    "we can see that the saxion dominance occurs in large fraction of the parameter space .",
    "then , when it decays , some amount of energetic axion is produced .",
    "the present density of the axion from the saxion decay is parametrized by using the effective number of extra neutrinos as @xmath231 here , @xmath232 and @xmath233 are energy densities of the axion and neutrinos in the present universe , respectively , and the factor of @xmath21 in the numerator is the number of generations of neutrinos . from the latest wmap observation @xcite ,",
    "the best - fit value of the effective number of neutrinos ( which includes the standard - model contribution ) is obtained as @xmath234 ( 68% c.l . ) .",
    "in addition , the analysis of @xmath235 mass fraction generated by the bbn reactions indicates @xmath236 ( @xmath237 ) @xcite .",
    "if the saxion abundance is too large , @xmath238 exceeds @xmath239 , which conflicts with observations . in estimating @xmath238",
    ", we should notice that the entropy production due to the axino decay may be sizable in the present case .",
    "@xmath238 becomes smaller as the decay rate of axino @xmath240 gets smaller .",
    "the axino decays into gaugino and gauge boson pair and the total decay rate of @xmath10 is smaller than that of @xmath7 if @xmath121 is close to @xmath58 .",
    "typically , @xmath241 , where @xmath242 is the number of final states and @xmath243 depends on the dominant decay mode ; if the axino mass is well above the gluino mass , @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "however , if the masses of the axino and the gauginos are degenerate , @xmath240 becomes suppressed .",
    "so the ratio @xmath246 is model dependent .",
    "notice that , if @xmath240 is too small , the axino decays after the bbn , which is likely to spoil the success of the standard bbn scenario .",
    "we vary @xmath240 and estimate @xmath238 .",
    "( we use the instantaneous decay approximation . ) here , the axino abundance is evaluated using eq .  , and the axino mass is taken to be @xmath247 . in figs .",
    "[ fig : mvsftr7 ] and [ fig : mvsftr9 ] , we show the region in which @xmath238 becomes smaller than @xmath58 if @xmath248 , and also the region in which @xmath238 becomes smaller than @xmath58 if the axino decays just before the bbn .",
    "if @xmath248 , @xmath249 for @xmath250 even with the entropy production due to the axino decay .",
    "if the axino decays just before the bbn , the effect of the entropy production is more significant . here",
    ", the energy density stored in the axino sector is assumed to be fully converted to that of radiation after the axino decay .",
    "this may be due to the pair annihilation of the lsp or due to the decay of the lsp via @xmath68-parity violation .",
    "even with such an extreme assumption , @xmath238 may be larger than @xmath239 if @xmath251 in significant fraction of the parameter space .",
    "such a problem may be avoided if the susy breaking parameters are tuned so that the @xmath121 parameter becomes relatively small . indeed , if @xmath252 , @xmath253 becomes comparable to or larger than @xmath254 , and the production of the axion is suppressed . in the region with @xmath255 of the figure , saxion once dominates the universe .",
    "even so , @xmath256 is possible if @xmath257 .",
    "in fact , as one can see , the constraints on @xmath258 from the cmb anisotropy and bbn indicate non - vanishing value of @xmath238 ; @xmath259 is preferred .",
    "if @xmath260 , @xmath261 is realized ( with @xmath262 at the time of saxion decay ) .",
    "another solution is to introduce the superpotential interaction given in eq .  .",
    "with such an interaction , @xmath7 may dominantly decay into higgs boson pair , and @xmath254 can be @xmath263.the interaction with the higgses may enhance the dissipation rate , which may also help to reduce the density of the axion . the study of the dissipation rate in such a case will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the saxion may also decay into the higgsino pair , which may result in the overproduction of relic lsp .",
    "however , such a difficulty can be avoided with large enough pair annihilation cross section of the lsp .",
    "this is the case , for example , if the lsp is the neutral wino @xcite .",
    "if the saxion dominantly decays into mssm particles , one should take account of the entropy production due to the saxion decay .",
    "the dilution factor is @xmath264 .",
    "next , we consider the case with @xmath265 . in such a case , if @xmath266 , @xmath95 and @xmath97 become heavier than @xmath98 and @xmath105 .",
    "even so , the trapping may happen if @xmath267 ; in such a case , discussion in the previous section holds .    if @xmath268 , the situation is rather complicated .",
    "this is because @xmath98 and @xmath105 may be fully thermalized as relativistic particles at @xmath269 .",
    "then , the scattering processes with @xmath98 and @xmath105 significantly contributes to the dissipation of the oscillation of the saxion . in addition , if @xmath268 , there may exist a minimum at @xmath187 caused by the thermal effects of @xmath98 and @xmath105 , with which the trapping process to the trapping minimum may not happen .",
    "( see fig.[fig : potshape ] . ) the @xmath98 and @xmath105 can be produced from the scattering of particles in thermal bath ( like gluon ) . even though the interaction between the mssm sector and the pq sector ( which consists of @xmath91 , @xmath93 and @xmath98 ) may be too weak to equate the temperatures of two sectors",
    ", we expect that the interactions among @xmath91 , @xmath93 and @xmath98 are strong enough to thermalize the pq sector ; such a thermalization occurs through the superpotential interaction of @xmath270 .",
    "thus , if the masses of @xmath98 and @xmath105 are smaller than @xmath172 ( at @xmath187 ) , constraint obtained in the previous section may not be applicable .",
    "this is the case when @xmath271 .      finally , we comment on the effects of thermally produced saxion .",
    "as we have mentioned , scattering processes of thermal particles produce saxion . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath272 is realized at some epoch , the saxion are thermalized .",
    "in such a case , the overproduction of the axion may occur if the saxion dominantly decays into axion pair . however , the abundance of thermally produced axino is comparable to that of saxion .",
    "then , entropy production due to the decay of axino ( as well as due to the subsequent pair annihilation of the lsp ) dilutes the axion abundance .",
    "if the decay rate of the axino is smaller than that of saxion , the effect of the dilution is large enough to make @xmath238 smaller than @xmath239 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied effects of saxion on the evolution of the universe paying particular attention to thermal effects on the saxion . because the axion multiplet necessarily couples to colored particles ( i.e. , pq fermions ) , saxion potential is inevitably deformed at high temperature . in addition , the coherent oscillation of the saxion may dissipate via the interaction with hot plasma .",
    "taking account of these effects , we have studied the constraint on the supersymmetric pq model with the superpotential given in eq .. because of the thermal effect on the potential , the saxion field may be trapped in a false minimum before the start of the oscillation , which may result in an overproduction of relativistic axion .",
    "the constraint strongly depends on the model parameters .",
    "we have seen that , if no pq sector particle remains in thermal bath after the onset of the oscillation , @xmath273 may happen if @xmath251 .",
    "in addition , if the dissipation rate is large enough , the saxion oscillation dissipates soon after the start of the oscillation",
