    "the search for mechanisms that may induce the spontaneous localization of vibrational energy in molecular materials has surfaced in a variety of contexts where such localized energy may then trigger other events .",

    "one well of the bistable potential represents the  reactant \" state , the other the  product \" state , and separating them is the  activation barrier . \"",
    "the bistable potential is connected to a thermal environment , typically through fluctuating and dissipative terms , and every once in a while a large thermal fluctuation causes the particle to surmount the barrier and move from one well to the other .",

    "this mesoscopic langevin - type of approach admits of an underlying microscopic description of the thermal environment and its coupling to the bistable system .",
    "for instance , the usual langevin equation with an instantaneous dissipation and gaussian @xmath0-correlated fluctuations can be derived from a picture in which the system is harmonically coupled to an infinite number of harmonic oscillators with a uniform spectrum .",
    "a generalized langevin picture involving dissipative memory terms and correlated fluctuations is associated with a more complex spectrum  @xcite .",
    "it is clear , and has become a topic of considerable interest , that the nature of the environment and its coupling to the bistable system profoundly influence the transition rate .    a different but related set of problems that has attracted intense interest in recent years concerns the spontaneous localization of vibrational energy in periodic nonlinear arrays . the pioneering work of fermi",

    "the existence of solitons and more generally of breathers and other energy - focusing mechanisms , and the stationarity or periodic recurrence or even slow relaxation of such spatially localized excitations , are viewed as nonlinear phenomena with important consequences in many physical systems  @xcite . the search for localization mechanisms that are robust even when the arrays are in a thermal environment  @xcite has , on the one hand , narrowed the problem ( because some localization mechanisms are fragile against thermal fluctuations ) but on the other hand broadened it ( because new entropy - driven localization mechanisms become possible ) .",
    "thermal effects may be particularly important in biophysical and biochemical applications at the molecular level  @xcite .",
    "the interest in the distribution and motion of energy in _ periodic _ arrays arises in part because localized energy in these systems may be _ mobile _ , in contrast with systems where energy localization occurs through disorder .",
    "localized energy that moves with little or no dispersion may appear at one location on an array and may then be able to move to another where it can be used in a subsequent process .",

    "[ drawings ] ) .",
    "the bistable system is only connected to the environment through its embedding in the nonlinear chain , and therefore the ability of the chain to spontaneously localize thermal energy and perhaps to transport it to the location of the bistable system can profoundly affect the transition rate .",

    "the spontaneous localization of energy in any system in thermal equilibrium is simply a reflection of the thermal fluctuations described by statistical mechanics and is unrelated to system dynamics . on the other hand , the way in which these fluctuations dissipate and/or move and disperse ,",
    "that is , the temporal evolution of thermal fluctuations , is dictated by the system dynamics and , in particular , by the channels connecting the chain to the thermal environment ( dissipation ) and the masses to one another ( intermolecular interactions ) .",
    "we pose the following questions : 1 ) how is the energy distributed in an equilibrium nonlinear chain at any given instant of time , and how does this distribution depend on the anharmonicity ? can one talk about _ spontaneous energy localization _ in thermal equilibrium , and , if so , what are the mechanisms that lead to it ?",
    "2 ) how do local energy fluctuations in such an equilibrium array relax in a given oscillator ?",

    "3 ) can local high - energy fluctuations move in some nondispersive fashion along the array ?",
    "can an array in thermal equilibrium transmit long - lived high - energy fluctuations from one region of the array to another with little dispersion ?    in our earlier work",

    "the equilibrium results to be presented here complement our observations , presented elsewhere , on the way in which these same chains propagate an energy pulse  @xcite as well as a sustained signal applied at a particular site  @xcite .",

    "along the horizontal direction in each panel lies a thermalized chain of oscillators ; the vertical upward progression shows the evolution of this equilibrium system with time .",
    "the gray scale represents the energy , with darker shading reflecting more energetic regions .",
    "several noteworthy features are evident in the figure",
    ". the energy fluctuations are greatest in the soft chain .",
    "this feature , seen earlier in chains with local anharmonic potentials  @xcite , is a consequence of the effect that we have called _",
    "entropic localization_. in the soft chain not only are the thermal fluctuations greater at a given temperature , a result easily obtained from a simple virial analysis , but the free energy is minimized by a nonuniform distribution of energy that populates regions of phase space where the density of states is high . we have argued that this localization mechanism is robust against temperature increases  indeed , it becomes more effective with increasing temperature .",
    "a second distinctive feature of the soft chain is the persistence of the energy fluctuations : damping is not particularly effective for soft chains .",
    "the only other mechanism for removal of localized energy from a particular location is along the chain .",
    "this is clearly not an effective mechanism , a result that is in agreement with our analysis of the propagation of an externally applied pulse in the soft chain  @xcite .",
    "the speed of propagation ( in all chains ) of a pulse of a given energy is essentially proportional to the average frequency associated with that energy , and in the soft chain this average frequency decreases with increasing energy  @xcite .",
    "although we do not see an obvious connection between these excitations and solitons at zero temperature ( which are not entropic localization mechanisms )  @xcite , there may be a closer connection with more generalized excitations such as breathers  @xcite .    in the hard chain ( fermi - pasta - ulam chain ) the total energy as well as",
    "the energy fluctuations are considerably smaller but quite mobile with little dispersion , as can easily be shown on the basis of a straightforward statistical mechanical analysis . in the hard chain",
    "the average frequency increases with energy and therefore more energetic pulses tend to travel more rapidly .",
    "we have also shown that the dispersion of energy in a hard chain is slow  @xcite  this is seen here in the integrity of the spontaneously localized pulses over a much longer time than in the harmonic chain .",
    "= 4.in = 4.in = 4.in    an important question of course concerns the parameter regimes where the differences illustrated in fig .",
    "[ landscape ] are observed .",
    "we have chosen potential parameters that insure clear distinctions in the displacement amplitudes associated with the three potentials at the chosen temperature .",
    "the only restriction is that the temperature not be  too low , \" that is , we avoid the region where all three potentials are essentially harmonic .",
    "we have chosen very low damping for the illustration .",
    "the soft energy landscape is far less sensitive to damping than the hard array .",
    "an increase in damping would readily slow down the motion of the high - energy fluctuations and would shorten their lifetime .",
    "further , while the speed of the energy fluctuation pulses is sensitive to the potential parameters , their lifetime and dispersion properties are less so ( as long as one is in the highly anharmonic regime ) . on the other hand , the persistence of the fluctuations in the soft array is quite sensitive to the harmonic contribution to the potential .",
    "all else remaining fixed , the landscapes remain qualitatively similar as temperature increases : the fluctuations in the soft array become even stronger relative to the others , and the pulse speeds in the hard array become even higher .",
    "suppose now that a bistable  impurity \" is embedded in each of these chains , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ drawings ] .",

    "in particular , we note the occurrence of a maximum : as predicted by kramers , the transmission coefficient at high friction ( diffusion - limited regime ) decays as @xmath28 ( and is independent of temperature ) ; at low friction ( energy - limited regime ) kramers predicted that @xmath27 is proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "an important generalization of the original kramers problem , the so - called grote - hynes problem  @xcite , reformulates the model in terms of the generalized langevin equation @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a dissipative memory kernel and the fluctuation - dissipation relation is now generalized to @xmath32 .",

    "we would like to understand the way in which the very different thermal landscapes described in section  [ chains ] affect the dynamics of a reaction coordinate evolving in a bistable  impurity \" embedded in these environments .",
    "the connection of the bistable impurity to the thermal environment occurs only through its connection to the chain , that is , we set @xmath33 .",

    "such models are interesting in the context of physical or biophysical situations wherein energy is released at some location ( provided perhaps by a chemical reaction or an absorption process at that location ) , which must then move to another location ( that of the bistable impurity ) to effect some further chemical process ( represented by the activation process ) .",
    "the usual linear chain models are plagued by the excessive dispersion that would make such transmission inefficient .",
    "nonlinearities in the environment may provide the necessary mobility with little attendant dispersion , thus greatly increasing the efficiency of such a process .",

    "<S> we present a model in which the immediate environment of a bistable system is a molecular chain which in turn is connected to a thermal environment of the langevin form . </S>",
    "<S> the molecular chain consists of masses connected by harmonic or by anharmonic springs . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution , intensity , and mobility of thermal fluctuations in these chains is strongly dependent on the nature of the springs and leads to different transition dynamics for the activated process . </S>",
    "<S> thus , all else ( temperature , damping , coupling parameters between the chain and the bistable system ) being the same , the hard chain may provide an environment described as diffusion - limited and more effective in the activation process , while the soft chain may provide an environment described as energy - limited and less effective . </S>",
