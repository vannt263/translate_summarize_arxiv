    "the production of hadrons in @xmath1 collisions at energies well below the mass of the @xmath7 proceeds predominantly through the annihilation of @xmath1 into a virtual photon .",
    "this process can only produce final states with charge conjugation quantum number @xmath8 .",
    "final states with @xmath9 can be produced by the annihilation of @xmath1 into two virtual photons , but the cross sections for these processes are suppressed by a factor of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the qed fine structure constant . final states with @xmath9 can also be produced by the annihilation of @xmath1 into a virtual @xmath7 , but the cross sections for these processes are suppressed by a factor of @xmath12 if the @xmath1 center - of - mass energy @xmath13 is small compared to @xmath14 . thus , unless there are enhancement factors to compensate for the factors of @xmath10 or @xmath12 , the production cross sections at @xmath2-factory energies for @xmath9 states are orders of magnitude smaller than those for @xmath8 states .    in @xmath1 collisions with large center - of - mass energy @xmath13 , factors of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a hadronic mass scale , can compensate for the suppression factor of @xmath10 .",
    "an example of such compensation can be seen in the exclusive double - charmonium production process @xmath17 @xcite . at the beam energy of the @xmath2 factories ,",
    "@xmath18 gev , the leading - order prediction for the production cross section for the @xmath9 final state @xmath5 has roughly the same order of magnitude as that for the corresponding @xmath8 final state @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the production cross section for @xmath20 scales as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the charm - quark mass .",
    "in contrast , the production cross section for @xmath5 scales as @xmath23 because there is a photon - fragmentation contribution that corresponds to the annihilation process @xmath24 , followed by independent fragmentation processes @xmath25 .",
    "the enhancement factor of @xmath26 in the production cross section for @xmath27 relative to that for @xmath20 partially compensates for the suppression factor of @xmath28 .",
    "a similar enhancement mechanism is present in the exclusive production of a pair of light vector mesons @xmath29 , both of which have quantum numbers @xmath30 .",
    "the production process proceeds predominantly through the annihilation process @xmath31 , followed by the independent fragmentation processes @xmath32 .",

    ", there is an enhancement factor of @xmath35 that compensates for the suppression factor of @xmath28 . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the cross sections and angular distributions for the exclusive production of pairs of vector mesons with @xmath0 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : nonfrag ] contains a computation of the nonfragmentation corrections to the cross sections for the production of two charmonium vector mesons . in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] , we compare our results with experimental measurements and with previous theoretical calculations .",
    "the appendix contains the expressions for the nonfragmentation corrections to the differential cross sections for two charmonium vector mesons .",
    "the lowest - order qed diagrams that correspond to the creation of the quarks in the two vector mesons @xmath36 and @xmath37 are shown in figs .  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] . if the two vector mesons have different quark contents @xmath38 and @xmath39 , then only the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are present .",
    "once the quarks are created , the formation of the vector mesons involves the exchange of arbitrarily many gluons between the quark lines .",
    "gluons can be exchanged between the quark and antiquark that form a given meson or between quarks or antiquarks that form different mesons . however , factorization theorems and the scaling of various contributions yield a simplification of this picture in the limit @xmath40 . in what follows ,",
    "we take the beam energy @xmath41 to be much greater than the masses @xmath42 of the vector mesons , which implies that @xmath43 is also much greater than @xmath44 .",
    "let us first consider the exchange of gluons only between the @xmath45 and @xmath46 within a given meson .",

    "factorization theorems are not well established for the production of heavy - quarkonium mesons",
    ". however , on the basis of existing factorization technology , it seems plausible , in the case of one light meson and one charmonium meson , that soft contributions cancel up to terms of relative order @xmath55 and that collinear contributions cancel up to terms of relative order @xmath52 . here",

    "in the case of two charmonium mesons , there are no collinear singularities .",
    "it is plausible that soft contributions cancel up to terms of relative order @xmath58 in this case .    finally , let us consider the exchange of hard gluons between quarks or antiquarks in different mesons .",
