    "it was exactly shown by the bethe ansatz that it is given by 2 for the kondo model @xcite .",
    "the effect of an impurity embedded in a one - dimensional interacting quantum system or in a tomonaga - luttinger liquid @xcite has been one of the most attractive topics during the 1990s and also in the last decade .",
    "it has been investigated in a variety of systems by different methods such as renormalization group techniques @xcite , conformal field theories ( cft ) @xcite , numerical techniques with cft @xcite , and the bethe - ansatz method @xcite .",
    "recently , it is studied by functional renormalization group @xcite and also experimentally in a quasi - one - dimensional conductor @xcite .",
    "however , it is still rare that the finite - temperature thermodynamic behavior is explicitly and exactly shown by a theoretical method for a large but finite lattice system without making any approximation or assumption .    in this paper",
    "we show explicitly the finite - temperature behavior of an integrable model of the spin-1/2 xxz periodic chain with a spin-1/2 impurity .",
    "we remark that the spin part of the kondo model is quite similar to the heisenberg spin chain , i.e. the xxx model .",
    "it is thus interesting to study the integrable spin - chains with the spin-1/2 impurity which are solved by the bethe ansatz . in the xxz impurity model",
    "we investigate exactly the effect of an impurity embedded in the interacting quantum spin chain similarly as the kondo model .",

    "we show how the thermodynamic behavior of the single spin-1/2 impurity depends on the impurity parameter . although it looks simpler than that of many impurities , it is still nontrivial and interesting from the viewpoint of universality and the crossover from the @xmath0-site to the @xmath1-site chain .",

    "we then show that the estimate of the wilson ratio at a given low temperature is independent of the impurity parameter if the absolute value of the impurity parameter is small with respect to the given temperature .",
    "we evaluate the local magnetization at the impurity site under a given small magnetic field at zero temperature and derive its analytic expression by the two methods : by identifying the impurity contribution in the bethe ansatz equations physically ; by calculating it directly through the algebraic bethe ansatz method @xcite .",

    "the magnetic susceptibility @xmath416 of the homogeneous xxz spin chain with no impurity is given by @xcite @xmath417 where @xmath418 is the group velocity of spin excitation at the fermi point : @xmath419 with @xmath420 being the dressed energy .",
    "for the homogeneous xxz spin chain with no impurity the specific heat @xmath415 at low temperature is given by @xmath421 for the bulk susceptibility and the bulk specific heat we thus have @xmath422    we now extend the calculation for the homogeneous chain@xcite to the xxz chain with the spin-1/2 impurity .",
    "we thus have @xmath423 where we have assumed the contribution of the impurity in the fermi velocity , @xmath424 .",
    "it follows from the assumption that the low - lying excitation spectrum of the xxz spin chain with the spin-1/2 impurity is given by the cft of central charge @xmath425 that the specific heat is given by @xmath426 thus , the wilson ratio for the impurity susceptibility @xmath427 and the impurity specific heat @xmath428 is given by @xmath429 we have thus obtained the wilson ratio given by eq . .",
    "for integrable impurity models such as the anderson and the kondo models the boundary cft is applied to characterize the impurity susceptibilities of the models @xcite .",
    "however , it seems that it is nontrivial to show that some conformal field theory describes the low - lying excitation spectrum of the xxz spin chain with the spin-1/2 impurity .",

    "<S> we also show that the estimate of the wilson ratio at a given low temperature is independent of the impurity parameter if its absolute value is small enough with respect to the temperature , and the universality class is described by the xxz anisotropy in terms of the dressed charge .    </S>",
