    "recent cosmological observations of the sneia ( @xcite ) large scale redshift surveys ( @xcite ) , the measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ( @xcite ) and wmap ( @xcite ) indicate that our universe is presently undergoing an accelerated expansion .",
    "the observational facts are not clearly described by the standard big bang cosmology with perfect fluid . the first suitable candidate which could drive the acceleration in einstein s gravity ,",
    "was the cosmological constant @xmath11 ( which has the equation of state @xmath12 ) , but till now there is no proof of the origin of @xmath11 . in the framework of general relativity , different interesting mechanisms such as loop quantum cosmology @xcite , modified gravity @xcite , higher dimensional phenomena @xcite , brans - dicke theory @xcite , brane - world model @xcite and so on , suggested that some unknown matters are responsible for accelerating scenario of the universe and which violates the strong energy conditions , i.e. @xmath13 and which has positive energy density and sufficient negative pressure , known as dark energy @xcite .",
    "dark energy associated with a scalar field is called quintessence @xcite .",
    "it is one of the most favored candidate for producing sufficient negative pressure to drive the cosmic acceleration , in which the scalar potential of the field dominates over the kinetic term . in the present cosmic concordance @xmath11cdm model the universe is formed of @xmath14",
    "26% matter ( baryonic + dark matter ) and @xmath14 74% of a smooth vacuum energy component .",
    "however there is about 0.01% of thermal cmb component , but in spite of this , its angular power spectrum of temperature anisotropies encode important information about the structure formation process and other cosmic observables .",
    "if we assume a flat universe and further assume that the only energy densities present are those corresponding to the non - relativistic dust - like matter and dark energy , then we need to know @xmath15 of the dust - like matter and @xmath16 to a very high accuracy in order to get a handle on @xmath17 or @xmath18 of the dark energy @xcite .",
    "this can be a fairly strong degeneracy for determining @xmath19 from observations .",
    "tonry data set with the 230 data points @xcite alongwith the 23 points from barris et al @xcite are valid for @xmath20 .",
    "another data set consists of all the 156 points in the `` gold '' sample of riess et al @xcite , which includes the latest points observed by hst and this covers the redshift range @xmath21 . in einstein s gravity and in the flat model of the frw universe ,",
    "one finds @xmath22 , which are currently favoured strongly by cmbr data ( for recent wmap results , see @xcite ) . in a simple analysis for the most recent riess data set gives a best - fit value of @xmath15 to be @xmath23 .",
    "this matches with the value @xmath24 obtained by riess et al @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "the best - fit @xmath15 for flat models was found to be @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the flat concordance @xmath11cdm model remains an excellent fit to the union2 data with the best - fit constant equation of state parameter @xmath26(stat)@xmath27(stat+sys together ) for a flat universe , or @xmath28(stat)@xmath29(stat+sys together ) with curvature @xcite .",
    "chaplygin gas is the more effective candidate of dark energy with equation of state @xmath30 @xcite with @xmath31 .",
    "it has been generalized to the form @xmath32 @xcite and thereafter modified to the form @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the mcg best fits with the 3 year wmap and the sdss data with the choice of parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite which are improved constraints than the previous ones @xmath36 @xcite",
    ".    an effective explanation to the late cosmic acceleration can also be obtained by the modification of einstein gravity . as a result",
    "various modified gravity theories came into existence .",
    "brane - gravity is one such modified gravity theory that was established with the aim of modelling our present day universe in a better way , and consequently brane cosmology was developed .",
    "a review on brane - gravity and its various applications with special attention to cosmology is available in @xcite .",
    "randall and sundrum @xcite proposed a bulk - brane model to explain the higher dimensional theory , popularly known as rs ii brane model . according to this model we live in a four dimensional world ( called 3-brane , a domain wall ) which is embedded in a 5d space time ( bulk ) .",
    "all matter fields are confined in the brane whereas gravity can only propagate in the bulk .",
    "the consistency of this brane model with the expanding universe has given immense popularity to this model of late .",
    "motivated by the previous works of some authors @xcite here we assume the frw universe in rs ii model filled with the dark matter and the mcg type dark energy .",
    "our basic idea is to determine the limits of the parameters involved in the eos of mcg using the observational data .",
    "we present the hubble parameter in terms of the observable parameters @xmath15 , @xmath37 and @xmath5 with the redshift @xmath6 . from stern data set ( @xmath38 points ) , the bounds of the arbitrary parameters is obtained by minimizing the @xmath8 test .",
    "the best - fit values of the parameters are obtained in @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 confidence levels . via a joint analysis with bao and cmb observations",
    ", we also obtain the bounds and the best fit values of the parameters ( @xmath9 ) by fixing the other parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 . from the best fit values of distance modulus @xmath10 for our mcg model in rs ii brane ,",
    "we conclude that our model is in agreement with the union2 sample data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the basic equations and solutions for mcg in rs ii braneworld is presented .",
    "the entire data analysis mechanism is given in section 3 .",
    "finally some observational conclusions are drawn in section 4 .",
    "in rs ii model the effective equations of motion on the 3-brane embedded in 5d bulk having @xmath42-symmetry are given by @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the electric part of the 5d weyl tensor . here",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 are respectively the 5d gravitational coupling constant , 5d cosmological constant , the brane tension ( vacuum energy ) , brane energy - momentum tensor and effective 4d cosmological constant .",
    "the explicit form of the above modified einstein equations in flat universe are @xmath50 and @xmath51 the dark radiation @xmath52 obeys @xmath53 here @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the energy density and pressure of the dark matter with the equation of state given by @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 are respectively the energy density and pressure contribution of some dark energy .",
    "here we consider an universe filled with modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) .",
    "the equation of state(eos ) of mcg is given by @xmath61 we also consider the dark matter and and the dark energy are separately conserved and the conservation equations of dark matter and dark energy ( mcg ) are given by @xmath62 and @xmath63 from first conservation equation ( 9 ) we have the solution of @xmath56 as @xmath64 from the conservation equation ( 10 ) we have the solution of the energy density as @xmath65^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha+1}}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the integrating constant , @xmath66 is the cosmological redshift ( choosing @xmath67 ) and the first constant term can be interpreted as the contribution of dark energy .",
    "so the above equation can be written as @xmath68^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha+1}}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the present value of the dark energy density .    in the next section",
    ", we shall investigate some bounds of the parameters in rs ii brane with the assumptions that @xmath49 = @xmath70 = @xmath71 ( i.e. , in absence of cosmological constant and dark radiation ) by observational data fitting .",
    "the parameters are determined by @xmath16-@xmath6 ( stern ) , bao and cmb data analysis @xcite .",
    "we shall use the @xmath8 minimization technique ( statistical data analysis ) to get the constraints of the parameters of mcg in rs ii brane model .",
    "from the solution ( 13 ) of mcg and defining the dimensionless density parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 we have the expression for hubble parameter @xmath74 in terms of redshift parameter @xmath6 as follows ( @xmath75 ) @xmath76 @xmath77^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] from equation ( 14 ) , we see that the value of @xmath74 depends on @xmath78 so the above equation can be written as @xmath79 where @xmath80 @xmath77^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ]    now @xmath81 contains four unknown parameters @xmath82 and @xmath1 . now",
    "the relation between the two parameters will be obtained by fixing the other two parameters and by using observational data set .",
    "eventually the bounds of the parameters will be obtained by using this observational data analysis mechanism . @xmath83",
    "* table 1 : * the hubble parameter @xmath16 and the standard error @xmath84 for different values of redshift @xmath6 .",
    "using observed value of hubble parameter at different redshifts ( twelve data points ) listed in observed hubble data by @xcite we analyze the model .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath16 and the standard error @xmath84 for different values of redshift @xmath6 are given in table 1 .",
    "for this purpose we first form the @xmath8 statistics as a sum of standard normal distribution as follows : @xmath85 where @xmath16 and @xmath86 are theoretical and observational values of hubble parameter at different redshifts respectively and @xmath84 is the corresponding error for the particular observation given in table 1 . here , @xmath87 is a nuisance parameter and can be safely marginalized .",
    "we consider the present value of hubble parameter @xmath5 = 72 @xmath88 8 kms@xmath89 mpc@xmath89 and a fixed prior distribution . here",
    "we shall determine the parameters @xmath82 and @xmath1 from minimizing the above distribution @xmath90 .",
    "fixing the two parameters @xmath91 , the relation between the other parameters @xmath92 can be determined by the observational data .",
    "the probability distribution function in terms of the parameters @xmath82 and @xmath1 can be written as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the prior distribution function for @xmath5 .",
    "we now plot the graph for different confidence levels . in early stage",
    "the chaplygin gas follow the equation of state @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",

    "<S> frw universe in rs ii braneworld model filled with a combination of dark matter and dark energy in the form of modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) is considered . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the equation of state ( eos ) for mcg is a three - variable equation determined by @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the permitted values of these parameters are determined by the recent astrophysical and cosmological observational data . here </S>",
    "<S> we present the hubble parameter in terms of the observable parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , redshift @xmath6 and other parameters like @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath7 and @xmath1 . from stern data set ( 12 points ) , we have obtained the bounds of the arbitrary parameters by minimizing the @xmath8 test . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit values of the parameters are obtained by 66% , 90% and 99% confidence levels . </S>",
    "<S> next due to joint analysis with bao and cmb observations , we have also obtained the bounds of the parameters ( @xmath9 ) by fixing some other parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit value of distance modulus @xmath10 is obtained for the mcg model in rs ii brane , and it is concluded that our model is perfectly consistent with the union2 sample data . </S>"
