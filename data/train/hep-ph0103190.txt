    "the existence of light goldstone particles ( lgp ) , usually pseudoscalar ( axion , arion , majoron , familon ) , is very attractive in many theoretical schemes ( for recent review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such particles are still elusive .",
    "so , the new method of their possible discovery looks attractive . in this respect ,",
    "the program of construction of photon colliders based on future linear colliders provides new opportunity .    to describe this opportunity we remind necessary features of obtaining photon colliders .",
    "the intense photon beams for photon collider should be obtained by backscattering of electrons prepared for the linear collider on the intense laser light @xcite .",
    "it is expected to obtain here the conversion coefficient @xmath1 ( the ratio of obtained high energy photons to the number of initial electrons @xmath2 ) close to 1 .",
    "the main features of conversion are described by quantity @xmath3 which determined via initial electron beam energy @xmath4 and laser photon energy @xmath5 as @xmath6 the best quality of photon spectra is obtained at highest values of @xmath3 , which are limited from above by a value about @xmath7 .",
    "the conversion coefficient @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of photons in the laser bunch , @xmath10  its cross section in the conversion point and @xmath11 is the standard cross section of compton scattering at c.m .",
    "energy @xmath12 .    from this",
    "it follows that the conversion region can be considered as @xmath13 collider ( @xmath14 is the laser photon ) with huge luminosity @xmath15 but small c.m.s .",
    "energy @xmath16 : @xmath17 here @xmath2 is the number of electrons in bunch and @xmath18 is the repetition rate .",
    "therefore , this conversion region presents unique place for the study of lgp production if its mass is less than @xmath19 .",
    "this opportunity was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss new potential given by effects of high laser photon density in the conversion region .",
    "this high density makes strongly probable the processes @xmath20 with simultaneous absorption of @xmath21 laser photon ( where @xmath0 is the high energy photon ) the number of produced lgp s is essentially less than that discussed in the text the corresponding cross section contains additional factor @xmath22 .",
    "evidently , in such a process the permissible region of lgp mass is expanded to values @xmath23 .    to this goal",
    "we discuss briefly modern status of different lgp ( section 2 ) .",
    "next we describe the method to calculate probabilities of processes under interest in the field of intense laser light ( section 3 ) .",
    "last we discuss the proposed registration method ( section 4 ) .",
    "the effective lagrangian describing an interaction of any lgp @xmath24 with electrons and photons has the form @xmath25      the axion is a light pseudogoldstone boson , proposed for the solution of the cp - violation problem in strong interactions @xcite .",
    "the existence of this standard axion is practically forbidden by modern data ( see e.g @xcite ) . however , the idea of natural explanation of cp symmetry is attractive , and the theory of the standard axion was modified to make its interaction with matter weaker and to make it lighter .    the axion model with two higgs doublets",
    "is characterized by the scale of breaking of the @xmath26-symmetry @xmath27 gev and the mass @xmath28 kev , connected by one parameter : the ratio of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of higgs doublets .",
    "the addition of new higgs multiplets breaks relation between @xmath29 and standard @xmath30 value .",
    "it happens that @xmath31 gev @xmath32 gev , the mass @xmath29 , just as the coupling with matter can become sufficiently smaller than in the basic theory @xcite . for example , one can introduce the additional scalar field ( @xmath33 singlet ) with arbitrary large vev .",
    "the obtained `` invisible '' axion @xmath34 is known as dine - fischler - srednicki - zhitnitsky axion ( dfsz ) @xcite .    the couplings @xmath35 and @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) are given by : @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 mev is the pion decay constant , @xmath40 is the ratio of the quark masses , @xmath41 is the number of generations , @xmath42 is the ratio of the vev s of two higgs fields . respectively ,",
    "the mass of axion is given by @xmath43 another form of `` invisible '' axion was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , now it is known as hadronic or kim - shifman - vainstein - zakharov axion ( ksvz ) .",
    "this axion does not interact with leptons at the tree level .",
    "therefore , its couplings to leptons and photons are two orders less compared to dfsz axion .    the archion model @xcite contains the global symmetry @xmath26 , its spontaneous breaking results in goldstone boson , which has both diagonal and nondiagonal flavor interaction with fermions .",
    "but unlike the axion the archion has no interaction with photons and it is like a hadronic axion with strongly suppressed lepton interaction .",
    "modern experimental limitation for electron - axion coupling gives @xmath44 @xcite ( in this review limitation for pseudovector coupling @xmath45 is presented . )    the astrophysical constraints on the vev , mass and coupling of `` invisible '' axion @xcite are very restrictive : @xmath46 @xmath47      the arion is a neutral , strictly massless , stable pseudoscalar boson with even charge parity , interacting with fermions @xcite .",
    "the interaction of arion with lepton is described by an effective lagrangian ( [ 4 ] ) with : @xmath49 here @xmath48 is the arion field , @xmath42 is the ratio of different vevs , modern estimations in higgs boson physics are in favor of @xmath50 . however , the astrophysical data are in favor of very small @xmath42 ( which are not forbidden yet in the standard two doublet higgs models ) . weakly interacting with a matter",
    "the arions can be emitted from stars .",
    "the arion emission leads to fast loss of energy from the stars .",
    "the demand of the condition by which the arion luminosity of the sun should not exceed the photon luminosity leads to @xmath51 .",
    "a more strong constraint appears from the evolution of red giants is @xmath52 .",
    "it gives weak coupling with leptons @xmath53 .",
    "a spontaneously broken global symmetry of lepton number will lead to massive majorana neutrinos and a nambu - goldstone boson , named the majoron .",
    "this can be accomplished by extending the standard model with an additional gauge - single higgs field @xcite , or @xmath55triplet higgs multiplet @xcite .",
    "the respective goldstone bosons are the chikashige - mohapatra- peccei ( cmp ) majoron and the gelmini - roncadelli ( gr ) majoron .",
    "cmp model requires the addition of a gauge - singlet higgs field and a right - handed heavy neutrino . the effective majoron -electron interaction induced at one - loop level",
    "is given by @xmath56 from the current upper bound @xmath57 it is easily seen that the coupling of the cmp majoron to matter is extremely small ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "an @xmath55triplet higgs multiplet is introduced in gr majoron model .",
    "the wave function of the gr majoron is primarily the phase field of the neutral component and has a small admixture of the higgs doublet with the mixing angle @xmath59 ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 being the vev s of the higgs triplet and doublet , respectively ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the gr majoron has a tree - level coupling to electrons @xmath62    the astrophysical constraint from the consideration of majoron emission rates of the neutron - star core is @xmath63 .",
    "thus , we have the following constraint on the coupling with an electron : @xmath64 .",
    "the familon is the goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of a global family symmetry ( horizontal symmetry ) between the generation of the quarks and leptons @xcite . since the breaking of the horizontal group can takes place at small distance @xmath66 only , the familon , similar to the invisible axion , interacts weakly with the matter and its mass should be small .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the interaction of a familon with a lepton at low energy has form ( [ 4 ] ) with @xmath67 .",
    "the absence of decay @xmath68 results in limitation @xmath69 ( @xmath70gev ) @xcite .",
    "the astrophysical constraint here is less restrictive , it gives @xmath71 ( @xmath72 gev ) .",
    "we consider the laser wave with circular polarization ( which is the best for conversion @xcite ) .",
    "its vector potential has form @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the momentum of laser photon , ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the matrix element of the lgp production by an electron in external field can be written in the form @xmath76    where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the exact solution of the dirac equation for an electron in the field of a circularly polarized wave : @xmath79    here @xmath80 is the energy and the momentum of lgp , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the momentum and `` quasimomentum '' of an electron @xmath83 note that @xmath84 this difference from @xmath85 is essential to find the production threshold .    using standard techniques ( see @xcite ) , we calculated the probability of lgp production by a nonpolarized electron @xmath86 @xmath87 \\right ) , \\ ] ]    where @xmath88 is the bessel function of @xmath89-th order , @xmath90",

    "since the effective mass of the @xmath130system is not large the characteristic emission angles of goldstones relative to the direction of the electron bunch are @xmath131 .",
