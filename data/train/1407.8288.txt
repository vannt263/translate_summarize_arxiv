    "the nonequilibrium dynamics of correlated lattice systems has recently been investigated intensively in various contexts.@xcite interaction - quench studies@xcite have been motivated by cold - atom experiments , where the interaction or hopping can be tuned by the feshbach resonance or by changing the depth of the optical lattice potential . in condensed - matter experiments , on the other hand , one can drive correlated electron systems with strong lasers .",
    "these perturbations may induce phase transitions , e.g. from an insulating to a metallic state,@xcite or in some cases metastable phases with interesting properties.@xcite in real materials , the electron - phonon coupling can play a crucial role in the nonequilibrium dynamics , and indeed many pump - probe experiments exhibit clear signatures of phonon oscillations.@xcite from a theoretical point of view , the interplay of electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in out - of - equilibrium situations is still far from fully understood .",
    "conventionally , the experimental results are interpreted in terms of a phenomenological two - temperature model,@xcite which is based on the boltzmann equation and the assumption that the electrons and phonons are in thermal equilibrium with respective , time - dependent temperatures . the boltzmann equation itself has also been studied numerically@xcite and analytically.@xcite    on the other hand , various techniques have been developed and used in recent years to study nonequilibrium electron - phonon systems on the microscopic level beyond the boltzmann equation ( gradient approxiamtion ) . in refs .  , the non - equilibrium dynamics of one or two polarons in the holstein model was investigated with a time - dependent exact diagonalization method . as for many - electron problems , previous works",
    "have investigated systems with classical phonons@xcite or quantum phonons@xcite in one - dimension .",
    "many - electron problems in two - dimensional systems have been studied with an exact diagonalization method for the holstein - hubbard model@xcite or with a weak - coupling perturbation theory for the holstein model.@xcite on the other hand , the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft),@xcite which becomes exact in infinite spatial dimensions , has been used to study the interplay of electrons and phonons in the mott insulating phase .",
    "these simulations , which employed a strong - coupling impurity solver,@xcite showed that the feedback of the lattice dynamics on the electrons can lead to significant changes in the spectral function , and to qualitatively different relaxation pathways .",
    "we also notice that this method has recently been applied to the single - electron problem in the non - equilibrium holstein model@xcite .    despite these advances ,",
    "studies treating the dynamics of quantum phonons are so far mostly limited to systems in or near the mott insulating phase.@xcite hence it remains to be clarified how an electron - phonon system thermalizes in weakly or moderately correlated metallic systems and how the phonon dynamics affects the relaxation process beyond the conventional analysis based on the boltzmann equation.@xcite in addition , various interesting questions that have been addressed in purely electronic systems ( such as the hubbard model ) remain to be answered .",
    "for example , one may ask whether or not the so - called prethermalization phenomena@xcite and dynamical phase transitions@xcite occur in electron - phonon systems . obtaining insights into the effects of the phonon dynamics",
    "is also important for establishing suitable approximate treatments and their limitations .    to address the above issues , we focus in this paper on the simplest possible model for an electron - phonon system , i.e. , the holstein model , which contains the coupling to local ( einstein ) phonons with neither coulomb interactions nor a coupling to some phenomenological heat bath . we also consider the simplest possible kind of perturbation ,",
    "i.e. , we drive the system out of equilibrium by a sudden quench of the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "such a quench may be realized in cold - atom systems in optical lattices,@xcite and it is expected to be closely related to the phonon frequency quench , which has been studied experimentally in bismuth.@xcite understanding the dynamics in this simple setup will provide a basis for the study of more complicated or realistic situations , e.g. photo - excitated systems , models with the coulomb interaction or with acoustic phonons .",
    "the holstein model is solved with the nonequilibrium extension of dmft,@xcite which is exact in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions .",
    "therefore , our results are relevant to systems with high spatial dimensions or large coordination numbers . as an impurity solver for dmft",
    ", we employ the self - consistent migdal approximation .",
    "while this approximation neglects the vertex correction in the self - energy and is based on the assumption that the phonon frequency and the electron - phonon coupling are small , this type of approximation has been successfully used to describe conventional superconductors in the correlated regime , and has also been justified with numerical studies based on the dmft framework.@xcite    an important point to note here is that the term  migdal approximation \" is used for two distinct types of approximations in the literature on the holstein model : one is the unrenormalized migdal approximation,@xcite where the _ non - interacting _ phonon propagator is used to express the effective interaction among the electrons .",
    "in other words , this approximation does _ not _ consider the phonon dynamics .",
    "this type of approximation has also been employed in recent studies of the dynamics of the holstein model driven by strong laser fields.@xcite the other is the _ self - consistent _ migdal approximation,@xcite where the _ dressed _ phonon propagator is used and thus the phonon dynamics affects the electron self - energy and vice versa . in the following , we call the former approximation the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation and the latter the migdal approximation , see fig .",
    "[ fig : schema ] .",
    "we will show that the migdal approximation is more reliable than hf , by benchmarking equilibrium results against dmft data obtained with a continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ct - qmc ) impurity solver.@xcite this is why we opt for the self - consistent migdal approximation to discuss the dynamics of the isolated holstein model after a sudden switch - on of the electron - phonon coupling .",

    "we have discussed the relaxation dynamics of the infinite - dimensional holstein model based on the nonequilibrium dmft .",
    "the dmft analysis is limited because the method neglects the momentum dependence of the electron and phonon self - energies , an approximation which is justified in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions .",

    "it turns out that the phonon self - energy can have a significant momentum dependence , as is clear from an evaluation of the lowest order phonon self - energy .",
    "in particular , the phonon self - energy vanishes in the zero wavelength limit . therefore , in order to discuss whether phonons or electrons are the bottleneck in the relaxation process in finite dimensions , we have to consider the momentum dependence of the self - energies .",
    "nevertheless , our results can be expected to be applicable to systems in high dimensions or with large coordination numbers , where the momentum dependence is expected to be not so essential .",
    "corrections from short - range spatial correlations can be captured by extending the nonequilibrium dmft formalism to a nonequilibrium dynamical cluster approximation ( dca).@xcite this route will in principle provide a systematic way to include the momentum dependence .",

    "it turns out that the thermalization crossover point moves to a smaller @xmath214 as we decrease the phonon frequency @xmath10 . in this regime , the migdal approximation becomes quantitatively more reliable , so that our observation suggests that the essential nature of the phenomenon ( thermalization crossover ) can be correctly described by the migdal approximation .",
    "the reason why we choose relatively large @xmath20(or @xmath215 ) and @xmath10 in this paper is because of computational limitations ( limited accessible timescales ) , though we note that these parameters are still significantly smaller than the electron bandwidth and in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the dynamics of the holstein model after a quench ( sudden switch - on ) of the interaction using the nonequilibrium dmft in the weak - coupling regime . as an impurity solver ,",
    "we have employed the self - consistent migdal approximation , which includes the dynamics of phonons via the phonon self - energy .",
    "it turns out that the local ( momentum - summed ) quantities exhibit essentially @xmath109 oscillations ( with @xmath90 being the renormalized phonon frequency ) .",
    "a key finding here is that there exists a thermalization crossover between two distinct regions as we vary the quenched electron - phonon coupling @xmath20 within the weak - coupling region : the smaller-@xmath20 region shows a fast damping of the oscillations originating from the phonon dynamics , with the momentum - summed quantities approaching the thermal values quickly , while the momentum distribution of the electrons exhibits a much slower relaxation ( electron - dominated relaxation ) .",
    "the second region corresponds to larger @xmath20 , but still in the weak - coupling regime ( well before the phase transition to the bipolaronic phase ) .",
    "there , the jump in the momentum distribution quickly vanishes , and the momentum distribution quickly approaches its thermal value . since the phonon oscillations damp more slowly , the momentum distribution oscillates with the phonons around the thermal value ( phonon - dominated relaxation ) .",
    "we have revealed that the change in the relaxation behavior originates from a different @xmath20-dependence of the electron and phonon self - energies .",
    "we have further confirmed the importance of the phonon dynamics by comparing the self - consistent migdal results with the hf results which do not include the phonon dynamics .",
    "it turns out that the latter approximation describes a totally different type of relaxation process with phonons effectively acting as a heat bath .",
