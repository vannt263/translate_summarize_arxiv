    "diversity of dark matter candidates requires the balanced experimental program in direct / indirect detection , astroparticle probes and collider searches .",
    "often these approaches make heavy use of numerical tools and computer simulations , and especially there is a variety of useful programs for the purpose of collider searches . in the case of dark matter , there are a few tools available but practically micromegas @xcite is the only tool that works for any arbitrary model for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "it is based on calchep and includes various components such as relic abundance , direct and indirect detection capabilities .    in this talk",
    "we introduce the updated version of maddm @xcite , a new dark matter tool based on a well known collider package , madgraph5@xmath0amc@nlo framework @xcite .",
    "new version incorporates direct detection capability in addition to relic abundance calculation @xcite .",
    "short description on the implementation of relevant effective operators and validations against existing results are presented in the following sections .",
    "maddm is available for download from launchpad web site , https://launchpad.net/maddm and no separate installation is required .",
    "however it uses python routines in madgraph5@xmath0amc@nlo and maddm needs to be copied under the main directory of madgraph5@xmath0amc@nlo .",
    "new version of maddm inherits the already established structure of maddm v1 .",
    "a python module prepares relevant amplitudes for relic abundance and direct detection ( with aloha @xcite ) , while a fortran module deals with the numerical calculations .",
    "maddm is compatible with any ufo ( universal feynrules output @xcite ) model that contains a dark matter candidate and can be easily linked to any width or mass spectrum generator which can produce a parameter card in les houches format .    for direct detection",
    ", maddm follows the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite . at the quark level , quark - dm interaction at the low energy",
    "is written in terms of a set of effective operators in table [ efftab ] .",
    "they are further classified as odd and even operators under the interchanges of quark and anti - quarks .",
    "projection over the effective operators select either spin - independent ( si ) and spin - dependent ( sd ) contributions . finally the corresponding cross sections are computed with the user s choice of target material and several options such as exposure time , size of the target material , threshold cut , detector resolution etc .",
    "we have made various consistency checks against existing results in literature .",
    "first we have considered all possible simplified models with different mediators ( scalar , fermion and vector ) and different dm candidate ( scalar , fermion and vector ) , which are shown in table [ efftab ] and verified that si and sd cross sections from maddm are consistent with results from micromegas . as an illustration of validation , here we consider two examples : scalar dm ( @xmath1 ) with higgs ( @xmath2 ) as a mediator ( @xmath3 ) and dirac fermion dm ( @xmath4 ) with a vector ( @xmath5 ) mediator ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "si and sd elastic scattering cross sections are shown in fig .",
    "[ simpmodels1 ] and fig .",
    "[ simpmodels2 ] , respectively , together with results obtained using micromegas . in both cases",
    ", we find an excellent agreement between maddm and micromegas with the differences at @xmath7 level .",
    "similar results are obtained with all operators in the table [ efftab ] .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    as for more complete dark matter models , we have considered minimal universal extra dimensions ( mued ) and minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with sps1a mass spectrum . for mssm , two cross sections from micromegas and maddm agree at the @xmath8% level .",
    "we have checked that this is true if we vary the neutralino mass around the sps1a point as well . for mued ,",
    "[ ued ] shows excellent agreement between maddm cross sections and results in literature @xcite .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    upon validating the dm - nucleon scattering cross section in maddm , we calculated the recoil rates for dm scattering off a target nucleus .",
    "we performed a simple , model independent validation of the recoil rate calculation , where we simply assumed that the dm - nucleon cross section @xmath9 pb , chosen for the purpose of comparison with the results from ref .",
    "@xcite . to reproduce the si",
    "recoil rates as a function of energy / angle as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we employed the differential recoil spectrum integrated over time and angle / energy . fig .",
    "[ dndetarek ] shows the spin - independent recoil rates as a function of recoil energy ( left ) and recoil angle ( right ) .",
    "we find that both distributions are in a very good agreement with the results found in ref .",
    "@xcite , over a wide range of target materials .",
    "[ dndetarek],title=\"fig : \" ]   pb . [ dndetarek],title=\"fig : \" ]    as a final validation of the maddm , we have reproduced the exclusion limit on the dm - nucleon scattering cross - section as a function of dm mass as in the lux 2013 paper @xcite .",
    "we assumed the efficiency function of nuclear recoils displayed in the black curve of fig . 1 in ref .",
    "exclusion curves shown in fig .",
    "[ lux_rep ] are obtained assuming 2.3 events , which coincide with the number of events at 90% confidence as required by the feldman - cousins confidence intervals .",
    "we find a good agreement between the lux data and limits from maddm .",
    "the exclusion curves can be obtained in maddm by using ` lux_exclusion ` routine found in the test routines part in ` maddm.f ` . the routine multiplies @xmath10 by the efficiency obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite , which is is then weighted by a 50% acceptance rate for nuclear recoils as stated in the lux analysis . from the recoil spectrum weighted by the efficiency and the acceptance rate ,",
    "the function then calculates the total number of expected events .",
    "the default value for the detector efficiency is 100% , and can be easily replaced with a user defined function .",

    "future version of maddm would include various features such as improvement on precision and speed in computation of relic abundance , relic abundance beyond the leading order , direct detection with loop - induced operators , indirect detection , web version , etc . furthermore various dark matter models with more complicated dark sector such as one in ref .",
