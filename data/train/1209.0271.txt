    "transit events for the t - lyr0 - 08070 ( v@xmath2=12.15 mag . ) were detected during regular operations of the trans - atlantic exoplanet survey network ( _ tres _ ) .",
    "@xcite classified this star as a long - period single - lined eclipsing binary with an f - star primary and an _ unseen _ m - dwarf secondary .",
    "they obtained follow - up spectroscopic observations using 1.5 m wyeth reflector at the oak ridge observatory and 1.5 m tilinghast reflector at whipple observatory . in order to reveal fundamental characteristics of the t - lyr0 - 08070 they combined photometric data from _ tres _ survey and _ keplercam _ photometry with those single - order echelle spectra in a wavelength window of 45    centered at 5187  .",
    "they obtained the radial velocities only for the f - star .",
    "since their spectra cover a narrow wavelength interval , there is a clear dependence between the effective temperature and the metal abundance of the star . for this reason they have ,",
    "modeled the spectra for metallicity index of -1.0 , -0.5 , 0.0 and + 0.5 to obtain effective temperature , projected rotational velocity and surface gravity of the primary star .",
    "@xcite modeled the _",
    "keplercam _ primary transit light curve employing the method of @xcite , which was an analytical light curve analysis developed for planetary transit searches . assuming orbit - rotation synchronization and adopting fe / h=-0.5 , the mass and radius of the primary star",
    "were derived as 0.95 and 1.36 . under the same assumptions , they derived the mass and radius of the secondary star as 0.345 and 0.360 .",
    "we planned new spectroscopic and photometric observations of the t - lyr0 - 08070 to obtain the masses , radii and effective temperatures of the primary and secondary stars .",
    "the photometric light curves were obtained in the bvri passbands and analysis are presented .",
    "the radial velocities for both components are also obtained and analysed .",
    "optical spectroscopic observations of the t - lyr0 - 08070 were obtained with the turkish faint object spectrograph camera ( tfosc ) attached to the 1.5 m telescope on 8 nights ( july , 2010 ) under good seeing conditions .",
    "further details on the telescope and the spectrograph can be found at http://www.tug.tubitak.gov.tr .",
    "the wavelength coverage of each spectrum was 4000 - 9000   in 12 orders , with a resolving power of @xmath3/@xmath4 7000 at 6563   and an average signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) was @xmath5120 .",
    "the exposure times were between 10 and 60 minutes during observations .",
    "we also obtained a high s / n spectrum of the m dwarf gj740 ( m0 v ) and gj623 ( m1.5 v ) for use as templates in derivation of the radial velocities @xcite .",
    "the electronic bias was removed from each image and we used the crreject option for cosmic ray removal .",
    "thus , the resulting spectra were largely cleaned from the cosmic rays .",
    "the echelle spectra were extracted and wavelength calibrated by using fe - ar lamp source with help of the iraf echelle package @xcite .",
    "the stability of the instrument was checked by cross correlating the spectra of the standard star against each other using the fxcor task in iraf .",
    "the standard deviation of the differences between the velocities measured using fxcor and the velocities in @xcite was about 1.1 .",
    "we have used our spectra to reveal the spectral type of the primary component of t - lyr0 - 08070 . for this purpose",
    "we have degraded the spectral resolution from 7000 to 3000 , by convolving them with a gaussian kernel of the appropriate width , and we have measured the equivalent widths ( @xmath6 ) of photospheric absorption lines for the spectral classification . we have followed the procedures of @xcite , choosing helium lines in the blue - wavelength region , where the contribution of the secondary component to the observed spectrum is almost negligible . from several spectra we measured @xmath7  and @xmath8 . from the calibration relations @xmath6spectral - type of @xcite , we have derived a spectral type of f3@xmath9 for the primary star . in fig.1",
    "we compare the spectrum of t - lyr0 - 08070 with the spectra of standard stars hd 224639 ( f0v ) , hd 223623 ( f2v ) and hd 18215 ( f5v ) .",
    "the spectra of standard stars are taken from the elodie archive database .",
    "this comparison confirms the spectral - type of the more massive star derived from the ew measurements .          the width of the cross - correlation profile is a good tool for the measurement of @xmath10 ( see , e.g. , queloz et al .",
    "the rotational velocities ( @xmath10 ) of the two components were obtained by measuring the fwhm of the ccf peaks in nine high - s / n spectra of t - lyr0 - 08070 acquired close to the quadratures , where the spectral lines have the largest doppler - shifts . in order to construct a calibration curve fwhm@xmath10 ,",
    "we have used an average spectrum of the hd128429 , acquired with the same instrumentation .",
    "since the rotational velocity of hd128429 is very low but not zero ( f5v , @xmath10 @xmath1114 km s@xmath12 , e.g. , @xcite ) , it could be considered as a useful template for f - type stars rotating faster than @xmath10 @xmath11 10 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the spectrum of hd128429 was synthetically broadened by convolution with rotational profiles of increasing @xmath10 in steps of 5 km s@xmath12 and the cross - correlation with the original one was performed at each step .",
    "the fwhm of the ccf peak was measured and the fwhm-@xmath10 calibration was established .",
    "the @xmath10 values of the components of t - lyr0 - 08070 were derived from the fwhm of their ccf peaks and the aforementioned calibration relations , for a few wavelength regions for the best spectra .",
    "this gave values of 58@xmath01 km s@xmath12 for the primary and 25@xmath09 km s@xmath12 for the secondary star .",
    "the rotational velocity of the primary star is in a good agreement with that estimated by @xcite .        for construction of the synthetic spectrum of the system the spectra of the standard stars ( @xmath13 psc and gj740 ) , obtained with the same instrumentation ,",
    "have been rotationally broadened by convolution with the appropriate rotational profile and then co - added , properly weighted by using physical parameters ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) of the components as input parameters and , then , doppler - shifted according to the radial velocities of the components . @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath19 were determined in  2.1.1 and  2.1.2 .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath20 were obtained from the combination of the light and radial velocity curves analyses ( see  4 ) . in fig.2",
    "we compare the observed spectrum of t - lyr0 - 08070 around the mgi triplet with the synthetic one for a system consisting of f3v+m3v type stars .      in order to provide high - quality light curves of the system in different passbands , we used si1100 ccd camera mounted on the 1 m telescope at the tbitak national observatory , turkey .",
    "si1100 camera utilizes a _ cryogenic _",
    "cooler 4k@xmath214k , fairchild 486 ccd that gives a 21@xmath22 field and a pixel size of 0@xmath23.72 when the binning is 2@xmath212 .",
    "differential aperture photometry was performed to obtain the light curves .",
    "the observed magnitudes of t - lyr0 - 08070 in the b and v passbands were compared with those for the comparison and check stars . the coordinates and magnitudes of the stars observed",
