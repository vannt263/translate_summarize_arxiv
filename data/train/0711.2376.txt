    "in the last years , there has been tremendous progress in nanotechnology , mainly oriented towards the design of the novel quantum electronic devices @xcite .",
    "light waves would transmit data at frequencies 10@xmath0 times faster than today s pentium chips , but using photons to carry data across a computer chip is currently impossible due to the optical diffraction in metals or semiconductors , which obstructs the propagation of light ( @xmath1 nm ) in electronic circuits miniaturized at dimensions below 100 nm .",
    "however , using plasmons one can to make devices the same size as electrical components but give them the speed of photons @xcite .",
    "due to difficulties in fabrication of three - dimensional transmission structures in the high frequency ( optical ) spectral range , two - dimensional structures are mainly being considered @xcite .",
    "therefore , alternative approaches are based on the physics of the so - called surface plasmon polariton @xcite . a surface plasmon polariton ( spp )",
    "is excited at frequencies lower than the plasma frequency ( @xmath2 ) , as a hybrid surface mode resulting from the linear coupling of its electromagnetic and electrostatic components : the electromagnetic wave is trapped on the surface because of the interaction with the free electrons of the plasma .",
    "concluding , we can define a spp as a combined excitation consisting of a surface plasmon and a photon .",
    "a surface plasmon ( sp ) is the collective electrostatic excitation of free electrons near a plasma dielectric surface .",
    "the importance of surface plasmons at a plasma boundary was widely recognized following the pioneering work of ritchie @xcite , and trivelpiece and gould @xcite .",
    "their investigations were restricted to the propagation of electrostatic surface waves on a cold plasma half - space .",
    "the effect of a finite plasma temperature has been studied later by ritchie @xcite using a hydrodynamical model , and by guernsey @xcite using a more complete kinetic approach .",
    "the frequency @xmath3 of a surface plasmon on a flat surface of a semi - infinite plasma can be easily determined from the frequency of the bulk plasma oscilation , as it corresponds to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are dielectric functions of the plasma and of the adjacent dielectric medium . for a cold plasma in contact with vacuum ,",
    "one obtains @xmath7 .",
    "the nonlinear propagation of the surface wave on a cold plasma half - space has also been investigated @xcite . the latter reprted either the existence of sp solitons , governed by a nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite , or the production and maintainance of a dense surface - wave driven plasma using a powerful oscillator at twice the surface - wave frequency of the plasma @xcite .",
    "vedenov @xcite provided a general description without limiting to electrostatic approximation , and showed that in a cold plasma half - space , spps exist with frequencies ranging from @xmath8 ( in the electrostatic limit ) down to @xmath9 , as is shown in fig .",
    "kaw and mcbride @xcite extended the plasmons analytical investigations by including the effects of density gradient and the finite plasma temperature on the spps .    ) , the surface plasmon ( sp ) with long dashed line ( @xmath10 ) , and the photon with short dashed line ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the coordinates are scaled as @xmath12 , and @xmath13,width=226,height=188 ]    we remember here the dispersion relation of the spp on a cold plasma half - space k_x^vacuum = -k_x^plasma ( k_y^2 -^2 c^2)^1/2 = -1 ( k_y^2 -^2 c^2)^1/2 , [ e1 ] where plasma permittivity @xmath14 must be negative ( the plasma must have an overcritical density ) , so that the surface plasma wave propagates along the @xmath15-axis , i.e. , @xmath16 , and decays ( is evanescent ) in plasma , i.e. @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the excitation of the surface plasmons is directly related to the problem of the anomalous transparency of light in materials with negative permittivities . in metallic nano - structures ,",
    "the electron plasma is an overcritical density plasma with a negative electric permittivity ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "media with negative electric permittivity and magnetic permeability ( the so - called left - handed materials - lhm ) posses the possibility of creating an ideal lens with subwavelength resolution @xcite .",
    "transmission through such a superlens is essentially based on the excitation of surface plasmons @xcite and the amplification of the evanescent waves due to their interference @xcite .    in metallic nano - structures",
    "no underlying ionic lattice exists , so that the electron dynamics is governed by the plasma effects @xcite . for such metallic plasmas , the quantum statistical effects should be included as long the electron fermi temperature is much higher than the room temperature .",
    "moreover , the charge carriers density in miniaturized semiconductor devices is much lower than in metals , but their de broglie wavelength can be comparable to the spatial variation of the doping profile , and the quantum electron tunneling effect can no longer be ignored @xcite .    for a dense quantum plasma in metals or in intense laser produced solid density plasmas , the investigations included plasma echoes @xcite and the quantum plasma modes and instabilities @xcite .",
    "major influence of the quantum effects have been proved for dense and dusty plasmas encountered in some representative astrophysical systems @xcite .",
    "it has been also demonstrated @xcite that the bulk ( high frequency ) electrostatic oscillations can propagate in an underdense quantum plasma due to the quantum mechanical effects ( the bohm potential ) .",
    "in addition , the electromagnetic surface waves arising in a plasma layer confined by a strong external magnetic field can be strongly affected by the quantum effects due to the magnetic inhomogeneity @xcite",
    ".    , and the surface wave is propagating along the interface , @xmath19-axis.,width=226,height=188 ]    in this brief communication we present the dispersion relation for surface plasmons that can exist on a dense quantum plasma half - space ( see in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the quantum model of the spp mode is developed in section ii , where we derive its dispersion relation by employing the full set of the quantum hydrodynamical and maxwell equations ( see the formalism used by kaw and mcbride @xcite for classical thermal plasma ) . both the quantum statistical pressure and the quantum electron tunneling effects are included here , while imobile ions are assumed to form the neutralizing background .",
    "further more , in section iii , we focus our attention on the electrostatic limit and present the dispersion relation for the electrostatic surface wave ( sp ) on a dense quantum plasma half - space . the sp mode is numerically evaluated for the specific case of a gold metallic plasma at room temperature .",
    "the results are summarized in the section iv .",
    "we consider an homogeneous quantum plasma half - space as shown in fig .",
    "the dynamics of the electrons are governed by the continuity equation    + n_0 = 0 , [ e2 ] and the momentum equation    = - e m*e * -2 t_fe m n_0 n + ^2 4 m^2 n_0 ^2 n , [ e3 ] where we have included both the quantum statistical effects involving the electron fermi temperature , @xmath20 , and the quantum diffraction effect contained in the @xmath21-dependent term ( sometimes called the bohm potential ) . here @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is a small electron density perturbation in the equilibrium number density @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the electron fluid velocity , @xmath26 is the magnitude the electron charge , @xmath27 is the electron mass , and @xmath21 is the plank constant divided by @xmath28 .",

    "[ e18 ] without the quantum effects , i.e. , @xmath43 , we recover from ( [ e18 ] ) the well - known dispersion relation , given in section i , for the spp on a cold plasma half - space .",

    "[ e19 ] introducing the normalized quantities @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , we rewrite ( [ e19 ] ) as = 1 ( 1 + k ) , [ e20 ] which is plotted in fig .",
