    "phase - ordering kinetics is very much an open problem in non equilibrium statistical physics .",
    "its quite simple formulation is in striking contrast with the difficulties encountered in its study , due to the strong non linear nature of the problem . during the past two decades",
    "much attention has been devoted to this field and much progress has been made in the understanding of what goes on after a quench inside the unstable region of the phase diagram@xcite . in particular , the late stage of the evolution has been studied with great care leading to a detailed knowledge of the scale invariant asymptotic time regime . despite this progress , however , most results recently obtained are still based on uncontrolled _ ad hoc _ approximations relying on the unproven dynamical scaling hypothesis , while a systematic theory allowing for the derivation of late stage properties from first principles is still far to come@xcite .    leaving aside this difficult problem , in this paper",
    "we mainly focus on what happens before the scaling regime is entered , aiming at a comprehensive description of the overall time evolution in a system with scalar conserved order parameter .",
    "specifically , we will consider the cahn - hilliard - cook ( chc ) model@xcite or model b in the classification of hohenberg and halperin@xcite .",
    "the study of the preasymptotic regime@xcite has been hitherto somewhat neglected because of the absence of scaling and universality .",
    "this feature on one hand makes the understanding of the preasymptotics less urgent and on the other makes it more difficult a subject to study than the late stage . as a result",
    ", all what we have in terms of early stage theory essentially boils down to the linear approximation@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it seems clear that an understanding of the complex phenomena taking place in the transition from the preasymptotic to the asymptotic regime is an important preliminary step in the development of a full theory of phase - ordering kinetics@xcite . in this respect , the effort undertaken in the last few years@xcite to make an assessment of the relevance of the large-@xmath0 model@xcite in the theory of phase - ordering kinetics has turned out to be quite productive . summarizing briefly , the large-@xmath0 model is the only exactly soluble model presently available for phase - ordering kinetics with conserved order parameter .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the exact solution for the structure factor in this model displays multiscaling@xcite in place of the standard scaling usually observed in experiments and simulations .",
    "then , the question was raised whether multiscaling is the true asymptotic behavior in all cases .",
    "the issue was settled by bray and humayun ( bh ) by introducing@xcite a more general model ( bh model ) which contains the large-@xmath0 model as a particular case and which displays standard scaling in the asymptotic regime for all finite values of @xmath0 , where @xmath0 is the number of order parameter components . from this result",
    "follows that multiscaling as an asymptotic property holds only if @xmath0 is strictly infinite , while for finite @xmath0 at most it may be observable as a preasymptotic feature .",
    "continuing this line of reasoning , in this paper we carry out a detailed analysis of the bh model arriving to a fairly complete picture of the mechanism regulating the structure of the preasymptotic behavior and , what is more important , we find that it applies also to the chc model .",
    "the main result then is that what appears to be the generic pattern in the overall time evolution is based on the sequence `` early linear - intermediate non linear large-@xmath0 ( or mean field ) - asymptotic fully nonlinear behavior '' _ combined _ with a strong dependence of the time scales of these regimes on the length scale . to be more specific , in wave vector space",
    "we identify three regions characterized by greatly different durations of the preasymptotic regimes and , furthermore , these durations can be modulated by the choice of the parameters of the quench .",
    "the three regions are the one around the peak of the structure factor and the two to the right and to the left of the peak .",
    "the concurrence of all these elements gives rise to a rich variety of behaviors in the preasymptotic phenomenology which can be nicely sorted out analytically on the basis of the equation for the bh model , but holds true for the full chc model as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ secmodel ] we introduce the model and after defining the observables of interest , we discuss the linear , mean field and bh approximations .",
    "the numerical solution of the bh model is analyzed in section  [ secbh ] .",
    "the corresponding analysis of the simulation of the chc model is presented in section  [ seccds ] .",
    "finally , section  [ secconc ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "a partial preliminary account of these results was published previously@xcite .",
    "we consider a system described by an @xmath0-component order parameter which evolves according to the chc equation for conserved order parameter = ^2 + ( x , t ) [ 4.1 ] where @xmath1 , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , is the mexican hat potential and @xmath4 is a gaussian white noise , with expectations \\ {    ccl < ( x , t ) > & = & 0 + < _ ( x , t)_(x,t ) > & = & - 2 t_f _ ^2 ( x - x)(t - t ) .    . here @xmath5 is the final temperature of the quench . in the following",

    "where @xmath6 is the size of the initial fluctuations . in the subsequent time",
    "development the average order parameter remains zero and the observable of interest is the equal time structure factor @xmath7 given by the fourier transform of the generic component of the correlation function @xmath8 .    if the final temperature is below the critical point we know that the structure factor evolves from the initial form c(,0)=[c_in ] towards the equilibrium form _",
    "t c(,t ) = m^2(t_f ) ( k ) + c^(eq)_t_f ( ) [ c_eq ] where the first term is the bragg peak associated to ordering , with an equilibrium value @xmath9 for the order parameter in the broken symmetry phase , and @xmath10 is the contribution of thermal fluctuations .",
    "the problem is to describe how this form of the structure factor evolves out of the initial form  ( [ c_in ] ) .",
    "parameters of the quench are @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "the physical picture born out of experiments and simulations is clear : after a certain initial transient , order is established over domains of size @xmath11 and within domains thermal fluctuations have relaxed to equilibrium .",
    "once this arrangement is achieved , memory of the initial condition is lost and the subsequent time evolution ( late stage ) is essentially limited to the coarsening of the ordered domains with thermal fluctuations enslaved in the equilibrium form .",
    "phenomenological arguments@xcite tell how the size of domains grows in time @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the peak wave vector of the structure factor and @xmath14 or @xmath15 in the scalar or vectorial case , respectively . at this stage",
    ", the structure factor can be split@xcite into an ordering and a fluctuation component which are , to a good approximation , decoupled c(,t ) = c_ord(k , t ) + c_t_f(k , t ) .",
    "[ c_tot ] the ordering component scales with respect to the size of domains c_ord(k , t ) = m^2(t_f ) l^(x ) f(x ) [ c_ss ] with @xmath16 , the space dimensionality of the system , and @xmath17 .",
    "the above scaling form is a finite size representation of the bragg peak and reveals that the late stage evolution is a critical phenomenon characterized by the pair of exponents @xmath18 .",
    "the final temperature @xmath5 enters only in the prefactor @xmath19 and the exponents are independent of both @xmath6 and @xmath5 . in this sense",
    "the late stage is universal and scale invariant , with an attractive fixed point at @xmath20 .",
    "most of the recent theoretical work@xcite has been concentrated on the study of the scaling function @xmath21 , obtaining successful results through approximations based on the assumption that scaling holds .",
    "much less is known about the process before the late stage is entered , when the time evolution is still sensitive to the actual values of the parameters ( @xmath6,@xmath5 ) , the scaling form  ( [ c_ss ] ) does not yet hold and the separation into an ordering and a fluctuation component is a much more delicate issue . in the following we address the theoretical study of the preasymptotic behavior .",
    "the traditional early stage theory is the linear theory obtained by setting @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ 4.1 ] ) .",
    "it is then straightforward to compute the structure factor c(k , t ) = c^(l)_0(k , t ) + t_f c^(l)_t_f(k , t ) [ 9.1 ] where c^(l)_0(k , t ) = [ 9.2 ] and c^(l)_t_f(k , t ) = 1 k^2+r \\ { 1 - } . [ 9.3 ] the distinctive features of linear behavior are :    * exponential growth for @xmath23 .",

    "[ clintf ]    this approximation is useful to describe what happens in the very early stage , when the requirement for the linear approximation to hold is met .",
    "namely , when the size of the nonlinear term in eq .",
    "( [ 4.1 ] ) is small with respect to the linear one . for the initial condition",
    "this implies @xmath28 ( small @xmath6 ) , where @xmath29 is the equilibrium value of the order parameter at zero temperature , at the bottom of the mexican hat potential .",
    "conversely , if @xmath30 ( large @xmath6 ) , the linear theory does never apply .",
    "however , even when it applies at the beginning , at some point this approximation is bound to break down due to the exponential growth for @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , the form  ( [ 9.1 ] ) does not describe coarsening , since the peak value of the wave vector remains constant in time , and the scaling form  ( [ c_ss ] ) never applies . in short",
    ", the linear early stage theory does not connect to the late stage theory .",
    "this is true also to any finite order in @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , any approximation aiming at a global description of the phase - ordering process must necessarily involve some form of infinite resummation of the expansion in powers of @xmath32 .      by analogy with the theory of critical phenomena , one may explore the @xmath33 expansion as a method to organize infinite partial resummations .",
    "to lowest order ( large-@xmath0 model ) , one obtains from  ( [ 4.1 ] ) the following equation for the structure factor = -2 k^2 [ k^2+r(t ) ] c(k , t ) + 2 k^2 t_f [ c ] with r(t)= r + g s(t ) [ r ] and s(t ) = c(k , t ) .",

    "this clearly depends on the relative magnitude of @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "less obvious is that it should depend also on the length scale and that there should be , therefore , a wave vector dependent crossover time @xmath48 . in order to understand how this comes about , a glance at fig .",

    ", the bottom line is that on the tails there is practically no competition between @xmath100 and @xmath90 , as the latter contribution soon prevails , while a long lasting competition takes place around the peak .",

    ".    figs .",
    "( [ fig03 ] ) and  ( [ fig04 ] ) show that immediately after the end of the early regime , at the time @xmath93 , coarsening begins with power law behaviors for @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "however , after some time , both these quantities display a pronounced anomaly localized around @xmath94 whose origin seems to be puzzling .",
    "this is especially true considering the behavior of @xmath13 , which obeys the same power law very precisely , with @xmath15 , before and after the anomaly ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig03 ] ) ) . for the peak height , while the power law is well obeyed with @xmath108 for @xmath109 , the behavior in the intermediate regime @xmath110 can not be easily fitted to a power law .",
    "the insight into what is going on is obtained by making a data collapse of the structure factor ( fig .",
    "( [ fig02 ] ) ) which gives evidence for the existence of a crossover , in the region around the peak , between two different scaling forms .",
    "both the preasymptotic and the asymptotic scaling functions are well fitted by the form f(x ) ~e^-a(x^2 - 1)^2 [ scalingfunction ] which describes the large-@xmath0@xcite and the bh structure factor@xcite around the peak .",
    "the change in the value of @xmath111 in going from one regime to the other means that around the peak @xmath100 prevails over @xmath90 long enough not only to go past the linear region , but also to leave behind the intermediate time interval ( @xmath93,@xmath94 ) where the dynamics is non linear with the self - consistency relation in eq .",
    "( [ c_bh_tot ] ) saturated to a good extent by @xmath100 alone . as a result",
    ", non linear mean field behavior shows up around the peak .    the picture of the overall evolution is completed by the behavior of the effective exponent @xmath64 . in fig .",
    "( [ fig00 ] ) , referring to times within the early stage , the mechanism of breakdown of the linear approximation described above is clearly displayed .",
    "for all the curves , except the last one , there are two qualitatively different behaviors for @xmath112 and @xmath113 , with @xmath114 decreasing with time . for @xmath113 the effective exponent @xmath64",
    "is well described by the linear approximation  ( [ 40 ] ) , while for @xmath112 is essentially flat .",
    "this corresponds to the onset of the power law to the right of the peak in the structure factor in fig .",
    "( [ fig01 ] ) .",
    "the retarded appearance of the other power law tail to the left of the peak corresponds to the deviation from the linear form of @xmath64 for small @xmath54 in the last curve of fig .",
    "( [ fig00 ] ) .",
    "the timings of the deviations from linear behavior at the different values of @xmath54 are a consequence of the shape  ( [ 40 ] ) of the effective exponent .",
    "breakdown of linear behavior shows up first at large @xmath54 , where @xmath64 is large and _ negative _ and later on around @xmath115 where @xmath64 , although small , is positive .",
    "next , the behavior of @xmath64 over the subsequent time history in fig .",
    "( [ fig05 ] ) shows the formation of very pronounced peaks to the right and to the left of @xmath50 .",
    "these are due to the very fast growth of the power law tails in the early stage , as it is evident from the spacing of the curves in fig .",
    "( [ fig01 ] ) . in this time regime",
    "the peak is the slowest growing mode in the system .",
    "it should be noted the multiscaling behavior around @xmath50 , which is produced by the mean field behavior of the peak in the intermediate time regime .",
    "later on the curves for @xmath64 flatten and collapse around the constant value @xmath116 .",
    "the disappearance of the time dependence from @xmath64 reflects the onset of standard scaling in the late stage .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the approach to asymptotic scaling is quite a slow process , since a small upward curvature of @xmath36 persists for a very long time . this curvature was observed in early measurements of @xmath36 in a variety of systems and was correctly interpreted as evidence that the large time behavior , although not yet fully asymptotic , was definitely approaching the standard scaling behavior@xcite .    as a test of the above analysis",
    "let us consider the expected behavior upon making large ( @xmath117 ) the initial fluctuations and smaller @xmath118 .",
    "the immediate consequences should then be the total absence of a linear regime and a considerable extension of the time interval where @xmath100 prevails over @xmath90 .",
    "it turns out that in this case it is not crucial to have extremely precise data , so we present results for @xmath80 .",
    "inspection of the evolution of the structure factor ( fig .",
    "( [ fig06 ] ) ) reveals a different morphology from the case of small @xmath6 and the absence of the linear behavior of the peak is quite evident .",
    "furthermore , the behavior of the tails is less dramatic and a power law appears only at the largest times for large values of the wave vector .",
    "more precisely , looking at the time dependence of @xmath13 and @xmath74 in figs .",
    "( [ fig03 ] ) and  ( [ fig04 ] ) we can recognize an early regime , which lasts up to a time very close to @xmath93 , followed by a second regime characterized by power laws .",
    "the features of the early regime can be explained from the behavior of @xmath100 for short time .",
    "namely , the exponential in the solution of the large-@xmath0 model  ( [ c_mf_0 ] ) is peaked at k_m^2 = - _ 0^t dt r(t ) 2 t .",
    "for very small @xmath69 one has @xmath119 and therefore @xmath120 . since in the case",
    "considered @xmath121 we have @xmath122 .",
    "this means that for very short times @xmath123 is monotonically decreasing and the maximum is at @xmath124 . during this short time interval ( not shown in our plots ) @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "as time proceeds , @xmath127 gets smaller and rapidly @xmath128 becomes negative while @xmath129 becomes positive and starts growing .",
    "this time interval corresponds to the decreasing behavior of @xmath130 in fig .",
    "( [ fig03 ] ) for @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , in the early regime the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ c_bh_tot ] ) is dominated by the contribution @xmath100 .    later on",
    "coarsening begins with power laws both for @xmath13 and @xmath74 .",
    "the behavior of the effective exponent in fig .",
    "( [ fig08 ] ) shows scaling since @xmath64 becomes time independent .",
    "the shape of @xmath36 obeys quite well the mean field multiscaling form  ( [ ms0 ] ) for @xmath132 and the standard scaling form @xmath133 for @xmath134 .",
    "namely , in the region where @xmath44 is negative @xmath90 dominates , while in the region where @xmath44 is positive , even though @xmath135 is also positive , due to the large value of @xmath6 it is @xmath100 that prevails , and not just around the peak , but for all values @xmath132 .",
    "this is an intermediate scaling regime , characterized by mean field behavior over an extended range of wave vectors .",
    "eventually , there must be the crossover to the asymptotic regime with standard scaling over all length scales .",
    "this occurs for times larger than those considered in our computation .      with a finite final temperature",
    "all three terms are present in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ c_bh_tot ] ) . without going to the most general case , for our purposes",
    "it is sufficiently illustrative to consider @xmath136 . in this case",
    ", we expect to find , after the early stage , a fairly long intermediate regime characterized by the finite temperature mean field behavior discussed in section  [ secmodel ] .",
    "the eventual asymptotic regime lies beyond the time interval considered in the computation . in the opposite limit @xmath137",
    ", the intermediate regime is expected to be very much similar to the one analyzed above with @xmath20 .",
    "choosing @xmath80 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 let us first consider the behavior of the effective exponent @xmath64 when @xmath76 . in this case",
    "an early linear regime is expected .",
    "this is demonstrated by the set of the first few curves in fig .",
    "( [ fig09 ] ) , which follow closely the behavior of eq .",
    "( [ 12.4 ] ) in the appendix . in particular , the signature of linear behavior with finite temperature is given by the relaxation of @xmath64 to zero for @xmath134 , which corresponds to the fast relaxation  ( [ clintf ] ) to the time independent value of @xmath7 for @xmath27 .",
    "after the early stage , fig .",
    "( [ fig09 ] ) displays the onset of the multiscaling regime with a shape of @xmath36 well represented by @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ mst ] ) .",

    "( [ c_bh_tot ] ) , yielding finite temperature mean field behavior . changing the size of the initial fluctuations to the large value @xmath117 ( fig .",
    "( [ fig10 ] ) ) , in the intermediate regime we find a different multiscaling behavior . for @xmath132 , @xmath36",
    "is well represented by @xmath141 , while for @xmath134 @xmath142 suggesting that in this region @xmath143 .",
    "hence , we find a behavior of the type described in the discussion of the large-@xmath0 model in section  [ secmodel ] .",
    "namely , the first two terms dominate the third one in eq .",
    "( [ c_bh_tot ] ) , and among them @xmath100 dominates for @xmath132 , while @xmath140 dominates for @xmath134 .",
    "the limitation of cpu time has not allowed to pursue the time evolution any further . however , on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ c_bh_tot ] ) we expect that there will be a second preasymptotic regime with @xmath140 dominating also for @xmath132 and producing the multiscaling behavior with @xmath143 for all @xmath54 , before standard scaling with @xmath144 is eventually established .",
    "in this section we analyze the overall time evolution of the structure factor for the ordering dynamics of the scalar chc .",
    "the main point is that the dependence of the preasymptotic behavior on the parameters of the quench @xmath6 and @xmath5 follows patterns very similar to those just described in the bh model .",
    "we consider first the zero temperature quench of the @xmath80 system with small initial fluctuations @xmath145 . apart from quantitative aspects to be specified below , it is evident from the inspection of fig .",
    "( [ fig11 ] ) , that the basic elements in the evolution of the structure factor are the same as in the analogous plot of fig .",
    "( [ fig01 ] ) for the bh model . here",
    "too there is an early regime characterized by linear behavior of the peak and rapid growth of power laws on the tails .",
    "the early regime is abruptly followed by the onset of coarsening which , as in the bh model , displays an intermediate regime delimited by an anomaly in the position and the height of the peak , before the eventual late stage is entered .",
    "it is then interesting to see if , as in the bh model , this intermediate regime can be associated to the manifestation of non linear mean field behavior . actually , that it is so it can be established in an even more clear cut way than in the bh model .",
    "in fact , the mean field growth exponent is @xmath15 while in the scalar system @xmath14 .",
    "these are precisely the values we find from @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "( [ fig16 ] ) ) which gives @xmath146 in the intermediate regime and @xmath147 in the late stage . from @xmath74 in fig .",
    "( [ fig17 ] ) we find consistently @xmath148 in the intermediate regime while no clear power law can be extracted from the data of the late stage .",
    "the existence of the mean field scaling regime around the peak in the intermediate regime is also demonstrated by the data collapse in fig .",
    "( [ fig12 ] ) .",
    "the fit to the form ( [ scalingfunction ] ) of the scaling function works well for preasymptotic scaling , as in fig .",
    "( [ fig02 ] ) , while is inadequate for the asymptotic behavior . finally , the comparison of the behavior of the effective exponent @xmath64 in fig .",
    "( [ fig13 ] ) and in fig .",
    "( [ fig05 ] ) completes the evidence for the close similarity in the overall time evolution in the chc and bh models with the same quench parameters .",
    "the difference in the space dimensionality is inessential .",
    "there are , instead , important quantitative differences , as mentioned above , in various features of the structure factor .",
    "thus for @xmath149 the scalar system has a @xmath150 tail while in the bh model one finds the @xmath104 tail . on the other side , for large @xmath96",
    ", the porod s tail @xmath151 of the scalar case is replaced by the exponential decay in the bh model and the analytical form of the structure factor is manifestly different around the peak in the two models .",
    "these differences show that certainly the bh model can not be used for an accurate computation of the scaling function in a scalar system , but are immaterial when considering the gross features of the overall time evolution , as we are doing here .",
    "thus , we have enough evidence to establish the sequence `` early linear -intermediate mean field - fully non linear late stage '' combined with the dependence of the crossover time on the wave vector , much in the same way as we have found in the bh model .",
    "we can go one step further and regard this phenomenology , by analogy with the bh model , as the manifestation of the competition among different components in the structure factor .",
    "if so , the phenomenology should respond to the variation of the parameters of the quench with patterns similar to those already observed in the bh model . as a matter of fact , taking @xmath117 the overall behavior of the structure factor changes from that of fig .",
    "( [ fig11 ] ) to the one in fig .",
    "( [ fig14 ] ) , closely reproducing the change in morphology observed between fig .",
    "( [ fig01 ] ) and fig .",
    "( [ fig06 ] ) .",
    "the same observation applies to the behaviors of @xmath95 and @xmath74 . comparing figs .",
    "( [ fig16 ] ) and  ( [ fig17 ] ) with figs .",
    "( [ fig03 ] ) and  ( [ fig04 ] ) the similarity is very close and it is definitely established upon comparing fig .",
    "( [ fig15 ] ) with fig .",
    "( [ fig08 ] ) for the effective exponent @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , by making @xmath6 large a considerable extension of the intermediate regime is observed , as in the bh model , and the manifestation of the mean field behavior takes place in the same way , with @xmath152 for @xmath132 and @xmath153 for @xmath134 .    in the scalar case ,",
    "however , a less rich variety of preasymptotic behaviors can be obtained by varying the parameters of the quench , due to much more rigidity in the model , in the sense that @xmath154 does not allow to modulate at will the strength of the non linear term , which is always large . in particular , because of the upper bound @xmath155 it is not possible to realize the conditions for the temperature term to be overwhelmingly larger than the non linear term .",
    "for this reason the phenomenology observed with @xmath25 is not significantly different from the one illustrated above ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig16 ] ) and fig .",
    "( [ fig17 ] ) ) .",
    "in this paper we have studied the global evolution of the structure factor from the very beginning of the quench down to the fully developed late stage in a system with conserved order parameter . by making a comparative study of the bh and chc model under variation of the parameters of the quench @xmath6 and @xmath5",
    "we have been able to identify generic features in the preasymptotic behavior .",
    "prominent among these are i ) the wave vector dependence of the time duration of the early and intermediate regimes and ii ) the mean field character of the preasymptotic behavior .",
    "these properties are tightly linked together .",
    "the existence of a mean field regime requires , in fact , multiscaling behavior which in turn implies a wave vector dependence of the crossover time . on the whole",
    ", the complex phenomenology of the preasymptotic behavior can be accounted for in a fairly simple manner through the competition of different contributions as exemplified in the structure of eq .",
    "( [ c_bh_tot ] ) . while for the bh model this is a direct consequence of the form of the equation of motion , the applicability of eq .",
    "( [ c_bh_tot ] ) to the evolution of the chc model is a non trivial new result .",
    "it should be noted that the preasymptotic phenomenology presented above is , in principle , experimentally observable and that it would be interesting to perform a multiscaling analysis of early time experimental data in order to look for the crossover from mean field to truly asymptotic behavior .    on the basis of the results produced ,",
    "the bh model qualifies for a reference theory of phase - ordering kinetics which captures most of the qualitative ingredients entering in the phenomenology of the process . in other words ,",
    "the model can be used as the starting point for theoretical work aiming at an improvement of the approximation in order to have a better performance in the computation of asymptotic properties such as the shape of the scaling function . in closing",
    ", it should be mentioned that the structure of the overall time evolution analyzed in this paper is by no means limited to the case of conserved order parameter . the crossover from mean field to asymptotic behavior",
    "is expected to be a relevant feature of the preasymptotic regime also when the order parameter is not conserved . however , in the latter case it is much more delicate to detect than in the former . with conserved order parameter the crossover",
    "is made evident by the change in the growth exponent from @xmath15 to @xmath14 and , most of all , by the spectacular change from multiscaling to standard scaling .",
    "these elements of discrimination are absent in the non conserved case , since the crossover does not involve any change in the value @xmath156 of the growth exponent and scaling is standard both in the mean field and asymptotic regimes .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .      in this appendix",
    "we compute the form of the effective exponent @xmath64 during the linear regime for finite quench temperature and vanishing initial fluctuations .",
    "when @xmath25 and @xmath76 the structure factor  ( [ 9.3 ] ) takes three possible forms depending on the range of the wave vectors considered .",
    "the boundaries between such ranges are fixed by the conditions 2 k^2 ( k^2+r)t=1 2 k^2 ( k^2+r)t=-1 .",
    "the first has only one real positive solution k_1(t ) = for all times .",
    "the second has two real positive solutions k_2(t ) = k_3(t ) = but only for @xmath160 .",
    "hence , two distinct linear regimes can be identified , depending on whether the time is greater or smaller than @xmath161 .",

    "for @xmath165 the argument of the exponential in eq .",
