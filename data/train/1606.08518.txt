    "understanding the dynamics of spreading processes in complex networks is a challenging problem with a wide range of practical applications in epidemiology and public health  @xcite , or information propagation in social networks  @xcite . during the last decade",
    ", significant progress has been made towards understanding the relationship between the topology of a network and the dynamics of spreading processes taking place over the network ( see  @xcite for a recent survey ) . a common approach",
    "to investigate this relationship is by modeling spreading processes using networked markov processes , such as the networked susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model  @xcite .",
    "based on these markovian models , it is then possible to find an explicit relationship between epidemic thresholds and network eigenvalues in static topologies  @xcite , as well as in temporal  @xcite , and adaptive  @xcite networks .",
    "a consequence of using markovian models in the analysis of spreading processes is that both _ transmission times _",
    "( i.e. , the time it takes for an infection to be transmitted from an infected node to one of its neighbors ) and _ recovery times _",
    "( i.e. , the time it takes for an infected node to recover ) follow exponential distributions .",
    "however , empirical studies show that , in most real networks , the distribution of transmission and recovery times are far from exponential .",
    "for example , the transmission time of messages in twitter , or news in other social media outlets , follows ( approximately ) a log - normal distribution  @xcite . in the context of human contact networks ,",
    "the transmission of immunodeficiency viruses  @xcite , or the time is takes to recover from the influenza virus  @xcite are clearly non - exponential .",
    "since realistic transmission and recovery times usually follow non - exponential distributions , it is of practical importance to understand the role of these distributions on the dynamics of the spread . in this direction",
    ", the authors in  @xcite illustrated via numerical simulations that non - exponential transmission times can have a substantial effect on the speed of spreading .",
    "an approximate analysis of spreading processes with general transmission and recovery times using mean - field approximations was proposed in  @xcite . in  @xcite , an analytically solvable ( although rather simplistic ) spreading model with non - exponential transmission times was proposed . using moment - closure techniques ,",
    "the authors in  @xcite analyzed spreading processes with non - exponential transmission and recovery times in special network topologies ( in particular , triangles and chains of length 2 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a tractable approach to analyze spreading processes over arbitrary networks with general transmission and recovery times . in this direction",
    ", we first introduce the _ generalized networked sis _ ( genesis ) model , which allows for transmission and recovery times following arbitrary phase - type distributions ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "since phase - type distributions form a dense family in the space of positive - valued distributions  @xcite , the genesis model allows to theoretically analyze arbitrary transmission and recovery times within an arbitrary accuracy  @xcite .",
    "we are particularly interested in finding conditions for the dynamics of the spread to converge exponentially fast towards the infection - free equilibrium with a given rate ; in other words , to eradicate the viral spreading process .",
    "in contrast with existing results  @xcite , we provide an analysis of the dynamics over _ arbitrary _ networks with general infection and recovery distributions ( without relying on mean - field approximations ) .",
    "the key tool used in our derivations is a vectorial representation of phase - type distributions , which we use to derive conditions for exponential stability of the infection - free equilibrium in the stochastic dynamics of the genesis model .",
    "based on our theoretical results , we show that modeling non - exponential transmission / recovery times using exponential distributions induces significant errors in the dynamics of spreading processes , as previously observed via numerical simulations .",
