    "the transport properties of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) have attracted a lot of interest since nearly perfect liquid behavior has been discovered in the relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite .",
    "further investigations in the heavy - ion collisions at higher energy are ongoing at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the discovery of nearly perfect liquid behavior seems to contradict the notion of weakly interacting qgp , and it rather suggests a strongly interacting nature of the qgp . indeed , the universal lower bound of the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density @xmath3 is proposed in the strongly interacting quantum field theories based on the conjectured duality between the gauge theory and string theory , or the anti - de - sitter space and conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite .",
    "this is close to the value @xmath4 , which is phenomenologically extracted from the experimental data by hydrodynamic simulations for the heavy - ion collisions @xcite .    in the heavy - ion collisions , not only the bulk collective dynamics but also hard probes , such as heavy quarks and jets ,",
    "reveal independent aspects of the transport properties of the qgp . for example , medium modification of heavy quark momentum spectra offers an opportunity to study drag force of the qgp acting on a test particle with color @xcite .",
    "phenomenological studies of the heavy quark probe in the heavy - ion collisions are summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite . since there is a kinematical hierarchy between the heavy quark and the qgp , the heavy quark dynamics is slow compared to the correlation time of matter constituents so that the effects of interaction between them are averaged out .",
    "this enables one to use a simple effective description of the heavy quark using the drag and fluctuation forces .",
    "there have been various efforts to calculate the heavy quark transport coefficients by the perturbation theory @xcite , by the lattice qcd simulations @xcite , and by applying the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "i shed light on the dynamics in the heavy quark color space .",
    "the langevin dynamics is a classical description of the brownian motion . unlike kinetic variables ,",
    "the time scale of the heavy quark color does not get long even with its heavy mass . typically , the time scale of color diffusion is about @xmath5 while the duration of a soft scattering is about @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , it is only in the weak coupling regime that one can expect the validity of langevin description that couples with the heavy quark color degrees of freedom . in the case of the heavy quark with color , description in the phase space is classical while that in the color space is quantum . here",
    "the heavy quark color is in the fundamental representation of color @xmath7 . instead of describing it classically by wong s equation @xcite in terms of a @xmath8-dimensional vector ,",
    "i treat a color state as a quantum state in a hilbert space with @xmath9 dimensions . indeed , the latter description is a direct consequence of the quantum description of the heavy quark brownian motion @xcite .",
    "the main finding of this paper is that an analog of the schrdinger s cat state appears in the heavy quark langevin dynamics due to the non - abelian interaction of qcd .",
    "the classical momentum corresponds to the cat and couples to quantum states in the color space .",
    "it is well known that decoherence of such a macroscopic superposition state is essential to have a classical picture of the brownian motion @xcite .",
    "consequently , the discretization time scale of the classical langevin dynamics must come out from the time scale of decoherence in the heavy quark sector .",
    "the discretization time scale turns out to be @xmath10 .",
    "it depends on the heavy quark mass @xmath1 and on the heavy quark momentum diffusion constant @xmath2 ( up to some factors ) .",

    "also the heavy quark hadronization time scale @xmath16 is shorter than @xmath15 and thus in any case the freezeout process may be able to resolve the macroscopic superposition state .",
