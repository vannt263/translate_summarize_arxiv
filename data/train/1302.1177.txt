    "to solve some dilemmas in the standard model of cosmology such as the flatness , the horizon , the monopoles problems and so on , inflation as an accelerated expansion era in the early universe was introduced by @xcite .",
    "this scenario is now dubbed as old model of inflation , in which the universe underwent a de - sitter expansion in a supercooled unstable false vacuum . afterwards , by proposing a scalar field ( inflaton ) as the source of inflation , a new inflationary model was introduced in @xcite . in this context , inflation was driven by the inflaton which slowly rolled down towards the minimum of its effective potential . to provide enough e - folds number",
    ", the potential must be nearly flat near its minimum .",
    "the nature of this scalar field has not yet been identified , but a simple possible candidate might be the higgs boson @xcite . to adapt the inflaton to the higgs boson ,",
    "a non - minimally derivative coupling model in which the kinetic term of the inflaton is coupled to the einstein tensor , was proposed in @xcite .",
    "this model does not suffer from unitary violation problem and is safe from quantum corrections .",
    "besides , slow roll inflation can be described by steep potentials in this framework@xcite .",
    "more general non - minimal derivative coupling model has also been considered in the literature to study the accelerated expansion of the universe in the early universe as well as in the late time @xcite .",
    "after the end of the inflation , the universe was cold and dominated by the inflaton scalar field energy .",
    "this energy had to be converted to relativistic particles to reheat the universe via a procedure called the reheating process @xcite .",
    "a proposal for reheating , is the decay of the inflaton to ultra - relativistic particles ( radiation ) during a rapid coherent oscillation phase about the minimum of the potential .",
    "these particles interacted rapidly to become in thermal equilibrium characterized by the reheating temperature @xmath0 , and the universe entered on the radiation dominated era .",
    "although the exact value of @xmath0 has not yet been known , but some upper and lower bounds for this temperature have been obtained in the literature . by considering that the reheating process occurred before the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , and by combining constraints on light elements abundance and data obtained from large scale structure and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , one can find a lower bound for @xmath0 , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "an upper bound may be taken as the energy scale at the end of inflation which is around the gut scale @xmath2 .",
    "these assumptions give a wide range for the reheating temperature .",
    "in @xcite by involving supersymmetry and considering the gravitino production , and on the base of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation data , this range was tightened to @xmath3 .",
    "a more accurate method to determine @xmath0 in terms of cmb data was introduced in @xcite .",
    "this method is based on determining the number of e - folds during the evolution of the universe from the inflation until the present time .",
    "although in this context @xmath0 may be determined in terms of spectral index and amplitude of power spectrum of scalar perturbations , but due to uncertainties of theses quantities in wmap7 data @xcite , a large relative uncertainty for @xmath0 is arisen : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    "we assume that the inflaton is a scalar field described by non - minimal derivative coupling model introduced in @xcite .",
    "we study the inflationary era , the rapid oscillation phase of the inflaton , the radiation dominated epoch respectively and employ the method proposed in @xcite to determine the reheating temperature in terms of the spectral index and power spectrum of scalar perturbations .",
    "finally , the value of @xmath0 and its relative uncertainty are computed from recent astrophysical data such as wmap9 and planck 2013 results .",
    "we use units @xmath6 through the paper .",
    "we consider the spatially flat friedmann - lematre- robertson - walker ( flrw ) space - time @xmath7 and choose an arbitrary length scale , @xmath8 , crossing the hubble radius @xmath9 at some time , denoted by @xmath10 , during the inflation @xcite . by using the red - shift relation @xmath11 where subscript @xmath12 denotes the present time and by taking @xmath13",
    ", we obtain @xmath14 this reference time will be used in division of the evolution of the universe into four parts as follows :    i- from @xmath10 until the end of slow roll , denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "ii- from @xmath15 until the reheating or beginning of the radiation dominated epoch , denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "iii- from @xmath16 until recombination era , denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "iv- from @xmath17 until the present time @xmath18 .    the number of e - folds from @xmath10 until @xmath18 is then given by @xmath19 where the subscripts denote the value of the parameter at their corresponding times .    in the following",
    "we will try to use eq.([4 ] ) to determine the reheating temperature in a non - minimal derivative coupling model in which the inflaton kinetic term is non - minimally coupled to einstein tensor .",
    "this inflationary model is described by the action @xcite @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the einstein tensor , @xmath22 is the scalar curvature , @xmath23 is the reduced planck mass given by @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is a scale with mass dimension .      in the era ( i ) , the universe is dominated by the inflaton scalar field .",
    "the friedmann equation is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the energy and the upper dot is @xmath28 .",
    "the pressure is obtained as @xmath29 with the help of continuity equation @xmath30 one can derive the equation of motion of the inflaton as @xmath31    in the continue , we restrict ourselves to high friction regime @xcite @xmath32 this choice , as we will see , by enhancing the slow roll procedure , enables us to consider more general steep potentials . during the slow roll , we have @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and therefore the friedmann equation and inflaton equation of motion reduce to @xmath35 respectively .",
    "the slow roll parameters @xmath36 , @xmath37 satisfy @xmath38 @xmath37 can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is defined with @xmath41 eqs.([13]-[15 ] ) , imply that by choosing an appropriate @xmath25 in high friction regime ( [ 11 ] ) , slow roll conditions do not oblige us to adopt approximately flat potentials .",
    "hereafter we will restrict ourselves to power law potential @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a real number , and @xmath44 is an even positive integer to guarantee that the potential has a minimum , about which the rapid oscillation of the inflaton occurs after slow roll .",
    "the number of e - folds in the era ( i ) is @xmath45 to obtain the above equation we have used ( [ 16 ] ) , and @xmath46 . to estimate @xmath47 , we consider the spectral index @xmath48 @xcite , @xmath49.\\ ] ] for the power law potential , this equation reduces to @xmath50 the number od e - folds in the time interval i is then obtained by substituting @xmath47 from ( [ 19 ] ) into ( [ 17 ] ) : @xmath51      at the end of slow roll we have @xmath52 , which yields @xmath53 at this time the energy density is approximately given by @xmath54 and the scalar field commences a rapid coherent oscillation around the bottom of the potential ( see fig.([fig1 ] ) , depicted for the quadratic potential @xmath55 via numerical methods ) .    to obtain the equation of state of the universe in this era , we follow the steps used in @xcite . in this high frequency regime ,",
    "the behavior of the scalar field is opposite to the slow roll , and its quasi - periodic evolution may be described as @xcite @xmath56 @xmath57 is some function of time and the time dependent amplitude , @xmath58 , is given by @xmath59 the rapid oscillation of the scalar field @xmath60 occurs after the slow roll .",
    "this high frequency regime is characterized by ( for more details , see the first reference in @xcite and also @xcite ) @xmath61 implying that the energy density and the hubble parameter decrease very slowly ( insignificantly ) in one period of oscillation of the scalar field @xcite .",
    "this can be seen numerically in fig .([fig1 ] ) which shows that although @xmath60 oscillates rapidly , but @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the change of @xmath58 during one period of @xmath60 oscillation .    with the help of ( [ 7 ] ) , ( [ 8 ] ) , and ( [ 11 ] ) , the continuity equation of the scalar field can be written as @xmath64 now let us take the time average of both sides of the above equation over one oscillation of the scalar field ( @xmath65 is the time average over an oscillation whose period is @xmath66 ) .",
    "the left hand side of ( [ r4 ] ) gives @xmath67 this approximation is valid only on time scales large with respect to the short period of high frequency quasi - oscillation . converting time integration to @xmath60 integration and using @xmath68 and ( [ r2 ] ) , we obtain the time average over an oscillation of the right hand side of ( [ r4 ] ) as @xmath69 to obtain the above relation we have used the evenness of @xmath70 , ( [ r2 ] ) , and also ( [ r3 ] ) which implies that the variables in the integral except @xmath60 may be replaced by their averaged values in one oscillation of @xmath60 in rapid oscillation phase .",
    "so finally we get @xmath71 in ( [ r7 ] ) and ( [ r8 ] ) , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the averaged values in the sense explained above and ( [ r8 ] ) holds for time scales large with respect to @xmath66 ( @xmath74 )",
    ". therefore on time scales much larger than the period of rapid oscillation , the effective equation of state parameter of the scalar field is @xmath75 where @xmath76 if the non - minimal derivative coupling was absent we would have @xmath77 @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "following our analysis and by using ( [ r8 ] ) , the hubble parameter can be approximated by @xcite @xmath78 to confirm and justify our results , based on eqs.([6 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) , and ( [ 10 ] ) , the behavior of @xmath79 is depicted via numerical methods in fig.([fig2 ] ) .",
    "this shows a good agreement between numerical result and ( [ 25 ] ) for large time scales .",
    "we assume that in this epoch the inflaton decays to ultra - relativistic particles ( whose the energy density is denoted by @xmath80 ) , to reheat the universe . from the beginning of rapid oscillation ,",
    "i.e. @xmath81 , until @xmath82 , which is the beginning of radiation dominated era , the universe is approximately dominated by the rapidly oscillating scalar field .",
    "therefore , in this era the hubble parameter can be approximated by ( [ 25 ] ) @xcite , and the scale factor during this era scales as @xmath83 at @xmath16 we can estimate the energy density as @xmath84 where @xmath0 is the temperature of ultra relativistic particles at @xmath16 , and @xmath85 is the number of ( massless ) degrees of freedom corresponding to the ultra - relativistic particles present in the model at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "collecting all together , we can estimate the number of e - folds during rapid oscillation @xmath86    to be more specific we must determine @xmath43 . to do so , consider the power spectrum of the scalar perturbation @xmath87 which is computed at the horizon crossing @xmath88 ( see ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) ) , where @xmath89 is a pivot scale .",
    "thus @xmath90 using this equation together with ( [ 19 ] ) and @xmath91 , and after some computations we find that @xmath92 substituting ( [ 31 ] ) into ( [ 28 ] ) yields @xmath93.\\ ] ]    so far , in our computations we have implicitly assumed that @xmath94 holds during inflation and reheating .",
    "but as the inflaton oscillation amplitude and consequently @xmath95 ( see eq.([r2 ] ) ) decrease , the validity of this assumption must be investigated . at the end of the reheating era ( beginning of radiation dominated era ) @xmath96",
    ", we have @xmath97 .",
    "as @xmath73 decreases , @xmath98 is the the minimum of the hubble parameter in the era i and ii ; so if @xmath99 then the assumption @xmath94 is safe in our computations . in terms of the reheating temperature , ( [ r10 ] ) may be written as @xmath100      in the radiation dominated era the universe is constituted of ultra - relativistic particles which are in thermal equilibrium , and undergoes an adiabatic expansion during which the entropy per comoving volume is conserved : @xmath101 @xcite . in this era",
    "the entropy density , defined by @xmath102 , is obtained as @xcite @xmath103 so we have @xmath104 in the recombination era , @xmath105 corresponds to photons degrees of freedom and consequently @xmath106 .",
    "hence @xmath107    the temperature decreases by the expansion of the universe via @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the redshift parameter .",
    "therefore we can express @xmath110 in terms of @xmath111 as @xmath112 we have also @xmath113 thus @xmath114      so far , we have determined the number of e - folds in the the right hand side of ( [ 4 ] ) . to obtain the reheating temperature we need also to determine @xmath115 in ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "taking @xmath13 , the number of e - folds from the horizon crossing until the present time is derived as @xmath116 , where @xmath117 to obtain the above relation we have made use of ( [ 30 ] ) and @xmath118 which is derived from ( [ 13]-[15 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) .    using ( [ 4 ] ) , ( [ 20 ] ) , ( [ 32 ] ) , ( [ 38 ] ) , and ( [ 39 ] ) we finally arrive at    @xmath119    where @xmath120 is defined through @xmath121 @xmath120 , up to this order of approximation , is independent of @xmath43 and @xmath25 .",
    "note that , following ( [ r11 ] ) , validity of the high friction assumption ( [ 11 ] ) requires that @xmath25 satisfies @xmath122    for the quartic potential , @xmath123 , ( [ 41 ] ) reduces to @xmath124 and for quadratic potential , @xmath125 , it reduces to @xmath126 in the minimal model , for the quadratic potential , the reheating temperature was obtained in @xcite : @xmath127 note that in contrast to the non - minimal derivative coupling model , @xmath0 in ( [ 48 ] ) does not depend on relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath85 .    by taking @xmath128 , which is the ultrarelativistic degrees of freedom at the electroweak energy scale , the reheating temperature in minimal model for quadratic potential",
    "was computed in @xcite as @xmath129 .",
    "this result was based on wmap7 data @xcite which , for the pivot scale @xmath130 , imply ( for @xmath131 cl , or @xmath132 error ) @xmath133 the relative uncertainty , @xmath134 up to first order taylor expansion , where @xmath135 was derived as @xmath136 @xcite . in our nonminimal model , for quadratic potential , and by using ( [ 43 ] ) , we find @xmath137 which is much larger than what was obtained in the minimal case .",
    "the relative uncertainty is now @xmath138    due to exponential dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath48 , the uncertainty in determining the spectral index has a large effect on the reheating temperature uncertainty .",
    "fortunately recent results from wmap9 , act , spt and planck 2013 , may be employed to obtain more exact value for reheating temperature with less relative uncertainty .",
    "these results are quoted in the table1 , _ for @xmath131 cl , or @xmath132 error_. the adopted pivot scale for the two first column is @xmath130 , while for the two last columns @xmath139 .",
    ".reheating temperature and its relative uncertainty [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     note that in the last column the relative uncertainty is less than one .",
    "this could occur in the context of wmap9 results provided that @xmath140 .    to compute the above uncertainties ,",
    "a first order taylor expansion was employed ( see ( [ 2000 ] ) ) which , because of exponential dependence of temperature on @xmath141 , is insufficient . to obtain more accurate bounds for @xmath0 one can insert @xmath48 and @xmath142 directly in ( [ 48 ] ) .",
    "for example for quadratic potential and using planck+wp+highl+bao data , at 2 sigma error ( @xmath143 ) , we obtain @xmath144",
    "non - minimal derivative coupling model with a power law potential was employed to describe the inflation ( see ( [ 5 ] ) ) . in this context , the slow roll inflationary phase of the inflaton was discussed in high friction regime ( see ( [ 11 ] ) ) .",
    "the rapid oscillation phase after the slow roll , during which the inflaton decays to ultra - relativistic particles , was studied . from the beginning of this rapid oscillation until the radiation dominated epoch ,",
    "the equation of state parameter of the universe can be approximated by a constant ( see ( [ r9 ] ) ) , which enabled us to compute the number of e - folds in this era ( see ( [ 28 ] ) ) .",
    "we also estimated the number of e - folds number in radiation dominated , and recombination era , in the same way as the minimal model ( see ( [ 38 ] ) ) . by gathering all these results together",
    ", we obtained the reheating temperature in terms of @xmath111 , spectral index and the amplitude of the power spectrum of scalar perturbations ( see ( [ 41 ] ) ) . finally according to recent astrophysical data",
    ", we determined the value of @xmath0 which is much bigger than the reheating temperature obtained in minimal model .",
    "this is due to high friction regime adopted in this paper , which enhances the decay of the inflaton .",
    "we also showed that the uncertainty in our result is very smaller with respect to the minimal model .    due to the transparency of the universe to gravitational wave the detection of primordial gravitational wave may also be used as a powerful tool to study the history of the universe evolution .",
    "expansion rate of the universe and his thermal history after the inflationary phase have direct imprints on the gravitational wave spectrum and its detectability @xcite . in @xcite , depending on the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath145 , and the reheating temperature , the required sensitivity of some experiments to detect gravitational wave was discussed .",
    "indeed there was shown that @xmath145 and the reheating temperature , @xmath0 , are the main parameters for determining the gravitational wave spectrum .",
    "as an outlook , in future studies , these results may be extended to our non - minimal derivative coupling model for which @xmath145 was computed in @xcite .",
