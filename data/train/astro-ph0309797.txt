    "galaxy clusters , by virtue of their deep gravitational potentials , are `` closed boxes '' , from which little matter can escape . they thus constitute ideal sites to study the time - integrated enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( see e.g. , buote 2002 , for a recent review ) .",
    "observations of galaxy clusters have revealed a number of intriguing puzzles .",
    "one such puzzle follows from x - ray spectroscopy , and shows that the intracluster medium ( icm ) gas consistently has a surprisingly high iron abundance , with a `` canonical '' value of about 0.3 the solar abundance ( e.g. , mushotzky & loewenstein 1997 ; fukazawa et al .",
    "1998 ; finoguenov et al .",
    "2000 ; white 2000 ) .",
    "combined with the fact that most of the baryonic mass of the cluster is in the icm , this translates into a large mass of iron .",
    "the tight correlation between total iron mass and stellar light from the early - type galaxy population ( and the lack of a correlation with late - type galaxies ) suggest that the stellar population , whose remnants and survivors now populate the early - type galaxies , produced the icm iron ( renzini et al . 1993 ; renzini 1997 ) . the near constancy of the icm iron abundance with cluster mass ( renzini 1997 ; lin , mohr , & stanford 2003 ) and with redshift out to @xmath11 ( tozzi et al .",
    "2003 ) further argues against a significant role in icm iron enrichment for recent infall and disruption of metal - rich dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , the iron mass is at least several times larger than that expected from core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) , based on the present - day stellar masses , and assuming a standard stellar initial mass function ( imf ; e.g. , renzini et al .",
    "1993 ; loewenstein 2000 ) .",
    "the problem is aggravated if one considers the large mass of iron that exists in the cluster galaxies themselves .",
    "a possibly related problem is the energy budget of the icm gas and the `` entropy floor '' observed in clusters , which suggest a non - gravitational energy source to the icm , again several times larger than the expected energy input from core - collapse sne ( e.g. , lloyd - davies , ponman , & cannon 2000 ; tozzi & norman 2001 ; brighenti & mathews 2001 ; pipino et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "proposed solutions to these problems have included an imf skewed toward high - mass stars ( so that a large number of iron - enriching core - collapse sne are produced per present - day unit stellar luminosity ) , or a dominant role for sne  ia in the icm fe enrichment .",
    "for example , brighenti & mathews ( 1998 ) calculate that the cluster sn  ia rate must be @xmath12  snu today and @xmath13  snu at @xmath14 to explain production of most of the iron in the icm with sne  ia .",
    "[ 1  snu@xmath15 .",
    "] this contrasts with the local elliptical - galaxy sn rate of @xmath16  snu ( cappellaro et al .",
    "1999 ) and argues against the type - ia enrichment scenario . on the other hand , renzini ( 1997 ) has pointed out that the approximately solar abundance ratios measured in cluster ellipticals argue for a mix of sn - types , and hence also an imf , that are not too different from the mix that exists in the milky way .",
    "attempts to derive the sn mix in clusters by means of direct x - ray measurements of element abundance ratios in the icm are still ambiguous , with some results favoring a dominance of ia s ( e.g. , buote 2002 ; tamura et al .",
    "2002 ) and others a dominance of core - collapse sne ( e.g. , lima neto et al .",
    "2003 ; finoguenov , burkert , & boehringer 2003 ) .    in gal - yam , maoz , &",
    "sharon ( 2002 ) , we used multiple deep _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ archival images of galaxy clusters to discover distant field and cluster sne .",
    "the sample was composed of rich clusters , with x - ray temperatures in the range @xmath17  kev , and a median of 9  kev .",
    "the candidate type - ia sne in the clusters then led to an estimate of the sn  ia rate in the central @xmath18  kpc of medium - redshift @xmath19 and high - redshift @xmath20 cluster sub - samples .",
    "the measured rates are low .",
    "to within errors , they are not different from sn  ia measurements in field environments , both locally ( cappellaro et al . 1999 ) and at high redshift ( pain et al . 2002 ; tonry et al .",
    "it was argued that our 95 per cent upper limits on the cluster sn  ia rates rule out the particular model by brighenti & mathews ( 1998 ) for sne  ia as the primary source of iron in the icm .",
    "the issue of sn  ia rate vs cosmic time is closely tied to the presently unsolved question regarding the progenitor populations of sne  ia .",
    "different models predict different delay times between the formation of a stellar population and the explosion of some of its members as sne  ia ( e.g. , ruiz - lapuente & canal 1998 ; yungelson & livio 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "the sn  ia rate vs time in a given environment ( e.g. , cluster , or field ) will then be a convolution of the star - formation history in that environment with a `` delay '' or `` transfer function '' , which is the sn  ia rate vs time following a brief burst of star formation [ e.g. , sadat et al .",
    "1998 ; madau , della valle , & panagia 1998 ( mdp ) ; dahlen & fransson 1999 ; sullivan et al .",
    "2000 ] .    in the present paper , the cluster iron mass problem is revisited , and some simple relations connecting the iron mass and the sn rate to updated values of the various observables are derived .",
    "we then use the observed upper limits on the cluster sn  ia rate to set constraints on the sn  ia progenitor models , on the formation of stellar populations in galaxy clusters , and on the cluster enrichment scenario . throughout the paper we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and a hubble parameter of @xmath23   km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 .",
    "detailed models of cluster metal enrichment have been calculated previously ( e.g. , buote 2002 ; pipino et al . 2002 ; finoguenov et al .",
    "however , the specific problem of the total iron mass in clusters can be formulated rather simply as a function of observational parameters .",
    "the ratio of observed iron mass to iron mass expected from core - collapse sne is @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the mass of a cluster , @xmath26 is the baryon mass fraction , @xmath27 is the mass fraction of the baryons in the icm , and @xmath28 is the mass fraction of that gas in iron .",
    "similarly , @xmath29 is the mass fraction of the baryons in stars and @xmath30 is the iron abundance of the stars . in the denominator",
    ", @xmath31 is the ratio of the initial stellar mass in stars of mass @xmath32 ( i.e. , stars that underwent core - collapse ) , to the mass in stars of lower mass , and @xmath33 is the iron yield of core - collapse sne , expressed as a fraction of the progenitor masses .",
    "lin et al . ( 2003 ) have recently derived improved estimates of stellar and gas mass fractions in clusters using infrared data from the 2mass survey . for rich clusters",
    "they find @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "their stellar mass fraction is based on the 2mass k - band luminosity function ( kochanek et al .",
    "2001 ) combined with dynamical stellar mass - to - light ratio measurements by gerhard et al .",
    "ettori ( 2003 ) has recently suggested that a significant fraction , 6 - 38% , of cluster baryons may be in a yet - undetected warm gas .",
    "however , if this new component has a similar iron abundance to that of the hot icm , our arithmetic will not be affected .",
    "we adopt the `` canonical '' icm iron abundance in rich clusters of @xmath36 ( e.g. , mushotzky & loewenstein 1997 ; fukazawa et al .",
    "1998 ; finoguenov et al .",
    "2000 ; white 2000 ) .",
    "this iron abundance relates to a photospheric solar iron mass abundance of @xmath37 found by anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) . [ using the updated photospheric solar abundance of @xmath38 , given by grevesse & sauval ( 1999 ) , which also agrees with the meteoritic solar value of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) , would imply simply raising the icm value accordingly ] .",
    "most of the stellar mass is in the elliptical galaxies , for which we adopt @xmath39 , the median found by j@xmath40rgensen ( 1999 ) for early - type galaxies in coma .    to estimate , @xmath31 , the ratio of exploding to non - exploding initial stellar masses , an imf , @xmath41 ,",

    "baldry and glazebrook ( 2003 ) have recently modeled the local uv - to - ir luminosity density of galaxies assuming a range of imfs and sfhs , and found the data to be consistent with the salpeter imf .",
    "a salpeter slope with @xmath46 and @xmath47 , gives @xmath48 .",
    "however , other imfs have been proposed .",
    "figure 1 shows the dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath43 for single - power - law imfs ( such as salpeter s ) of various indices @xmath49 , and for `` standard '' imfs .",
    "varying @xmath44 has a weak effect on @xmath31 , as long as the imf is steep enough .",
    "core collapse models generally agree on an iron yield of about @xmath50 per sn ( e.g. , thielemann , nomoto , & hashimoto 1996 ) . in observed core - collapse sne",
    ", estimates of the total yield of ni@xmath51 ( which decays to fe@xmath51 and drives the optical luminosity of sne ) have been obtained by different methods  the luminosity of the radioactive tail , the luminosity of the plateau phase , and the h@xmath49 luminosity in the nebular phase ( elmhamdi , chugai , & danziger 2003 ) .",
    "the different methods give consistent results for a given sn , but there is a large scatter among different sne ( e.g. , zampieri et al . 2003 ) and a range of yields as large as 0.0016 to 0.26 @xmath52 ( hamuy 2003 ) , with a mean of @xmath53 ( elmhamdi et al . 2003 ) .",
    "progenitor masses are more difficult to estimate , but there are some indications that the iron yield and the progenitor mass are correlated , i.e. , the iron yield is some fraction of the progenitor mass , of order 0.5 - 1% ( p. mazzali , private communication ) . since the ratio of the mean iron yield found by elmhamdi et al .",
    "( 2003 ; @xmath53 ) to the minimum progenitor mass ( @xmath54 ) is @xmath55 , and the ratio is probably even smaller for those events with more massive progenitors , we will err conservatively by assuming a large fractional iron mass yield of @xmath56 .    combining the estimates above",

    ", we can also see to what degree the imf must be made `` top heavy '' in order to solve the problem with core - collapse sne only ; @xmath59 needs to be greater than @xmath60 , or @xmath61 , or some other suitable combination of @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the discrepancy can be lowered somewhat by assuming a larger stellar mass fraction , @xmath64 . however , only a completely unrealistic value of @xmath65 , would lower the discrepancy to a non - crisis level .",
    "stated differently , the iron mass within the cluster galaxies is the amount expected from core - collapse sne and a normal imf , while all the iron in the icm is an excess over this expectation .",
    "this , too , has been found in detailed modeling ( e.g. brighenti & mathews 1998 ) .",
    "if the dominant contribution to the observed iron mass in clusters is from sne  ia , it is straightforward to predict the rate of these events , @xmath66 , as a function of time @xmath67 or redshift @xmath1 .",
    "as already noted , the sn  ia rate vs time in a given environment is the convolution of the star - formation history in that environment with a `` delay '' or `` transfer function '' , @xmath68 , which is the sn  ia rate vs time following a brief burst of star formation at @xmath69 . in the case of clusters ,",
    "all evidence is that star formation occurred considerably before @xmath11 .",
    "let us assume , first , that star formation occurred in a brief burst , at cosmic time @xmath70 , corresponding to a redshift @xmath71 .",
    "then simply @xmath72    various authors have used different approaches to represent @xmath68 .",
    "for example , ruiz - lapuente & canal ( 1998 ) and yungelson & livio ( 2000 ) have attempted to derive physically motivated versions of @xmath68 for the different progenitor scenarios , including binary evolution and accretion physics .",
    "such calculations are complex and , by necessity , include a large number of assumptions and poorly known parameters",
    ". nevertheless , the resulting @xmath68 functions have a number of generic features : a delay until the progenitor population forms ; a fast rise to maximum ; and a power - law or exponential decay .",
    "these general forms suggest an alternative , more phenomenological , parametrization of @xmath68 , as has been adopted by sadat et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , mdp , and dahlen & fransson ( 1999 ) .      in a given cluster , the integral on @xmath81 over time",
    "gives the total number of sne  ia that have exploded in that cluster .",
    "if most of the cluster iron is from sne  ia , this total number is just the observed iron mass ( minus the small fraction expected from core - collapse sne arising from a normal imf , eq . [ feobssnii ] ) , divided by the iron mass yield per sn  ia . the normalization of @xmath81 is therefore set by @xmath82    the mean iron yield of a single sn  ia , @xmath83 , is generally agreed to be about @xmath84 .",
    "this emerges from modeling of the bolometric light curves of sne  ia ( e.g. , contardo , leibundgut , & vacca 2000 , and references therein ) , as well as from sn  ia model calculations ( e.g. , thielemann , nomoto , & yokoi 1986 ) .",
    "if star formation is not in an instantaneous burst , but rather begins at @xmath70 and lasts some period of time , the occurrence of some sne  ia will be delayed .",
    "the sn  ia rate at later times , given the same total iron mass , will be necessarily greater than under the brief burst assumption .",
    "the assumption of a single , brief , star - formation burst at @xmath70 will therefore lead to a lower limit for the predicted sn  ia rate at later times .    rewriting eq .",
    "[ intria1 ] with the fiducial values above and in eq .",

    "galaxy kinematics , modeling of the x - ray emission , and strong and weak gravitational lensing give generally consistent results for this parameter .",
    "the fraction of the cluster mass that is in baryons , @xmath26 , is 10 - 30% ( ettori & fabian 1999 ; mohr , mathiesen & evrard 1999 ; allen et al .",
    "2002 ; arnaud et al .",
    "2002 ) , and is thought to be representative of the universal baryonic mass fraction .",
    "we therefore adopt the cosmic value , 0.17 , as recently measured with wmap ( spergel et al . 2003 ) .    the time - integrated number of sne  ia per unit stellar luminosity obtained from eq .",
    "[ intria2 ] for the fiducial values , can also be expressed as @xmath90 in other words , to produce the iron mass seen in clusters with sne  ia , there must have been in the past one sn  ia for every @xmath91 of present - day stellar luminosity .",
    "equivalently , the mean sn  ia rate over a @xmath92  gyr cluster age must have been 4.3  snu .",
    "since present day rates ( e.g. , in virgo cluster ellipticals ; cappellaro et al .",
    "1999 ) are much lower than this , the rate must have been much higher in the past .",
    "thus , the assumption of a brief star - formation burst at some time @xmath70 in the past , followed by a sn  ia rate @xmath93 with characteristic time @xmath10 , determines the form of @xmath94 .",

    "existing measurements of cluster sn  ia rates are by reiss ( 2000 ) for @xmath96 , and by gal - yam et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "the error bars show the 95% confidence intervals .",
    "figure 4 is the same , but zooms in on the region @xmath99 , where the data exist .",
    "figure 4 shows that the @xmath11 sn  ia rate measurement is inconsistent with several of the plotted models .",
    "however , in the comparison , we must keep in mind that there are uncertainties in the parameters entering eq .",
    "[ intria2 ] , which sets the normalization of the curves .",
    "the main uncertainty , @xmath100 , is in the mean @xmath101 of clusters .",
    "accounting also for the ( smaller ) uncertainties in the other parameters , we consider the measured 95% upper limit on @xmath66 at @xmath102 to be in conflict with the model with @xmath103 , @xmath104  gyr , and the model with @xmath103 , @xmath105  gyr . the upper limit on @xmath94 is at @xmath106 of the predicted values for these models .",
    "the model with @xmath107 , @xmath108  gyr is marginally consistent with the @xmath102 data point , given the uncertainty in the prediction .",
    "however , this model gives an unacceptably high rate at low redshift , and therefore can also be rejected .",
    "the low observed sn  ia rate at @xmath109 means that , if cluster iron was produced by sne  ia , those sne must have occurred at earlier times , times that have yet to be probed by observations . to push the sne  ia to such early times , one must invoke early star formation _ and _ a short sn  ia delay time .    a recent attempt by van dokkum & franx ( 2001 ) to deduce the epoch of star formation in cluster ellipticals by spectral synthesis modeling of the stellar populations , and accounting for biases in the selection of elliptical galaxies , finds stellar formation redshifts of @xmath110 .",
    "if we adopt a particular formation redshift , say @xmath103 , the resulting upper limit of @xmath3  gyr places clear constraints on sn  ia progenitor models .",
    "two of the models by yungelson & livio ( 2000 ) predict longer delays and are therefore ruled out . in the double degenerate model ,",
    "two wds merge , and the resulting object , having a mass larger than the chandrasekhar limit , is subject to a runaway thermonuclear explosion triggered at its core .",
    "yungelson & livio find that the delay function of such systems has an exponential cutoff at @xmath111 gyr , at odds with the above upper limit on @xmath10 .",
    "a similar discrepancy exists for a model where a wd accrets he - rich material from a he - star companion , leading to helium ignition on the surface of the wd and an edge - lit detonation of the star .",
    "this model has a delay function that cuts off at @xmath112  gyr .",
    "one must recap here that all these conclusions hold under the assumption that the stars in galaxy clusters were formed with a standard imf , and therefore most of the iron is from sne  ia .",
    "if the stars were formed with a sufficiently top - heavy imf to produce the observed iron , few sne  ia are expected at any redshift , and the sn  ia rate measurements place no constraints on cluster star - formation epoch or on sn  ia time delay .",
    "since our conclusions are based on the comparison of a low observed cluster sn  ia rate at @xmath11 to the high rate predicted by some models , it is sensible to re - examine the reliability of the observation .",
    "one possibility to consider is that the rate measured by gal - yam et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , based on deep _ hst _ cluster images , was low because the sn detection efficiency was overestimated .",
    "some faint cluster sne that were missed would then be incorrectly accounted for in the rate calculations .",
    "this is highly unlikely , given that the actually detected cluster sne were relatively bright , with @xmath113  mag .",
    "much fainter sne , down to 28  mag , _ were _ found by the survey , demonstrating its high sensitivity , but these sne were background and foreground events , rather than cluster events .",
    "a second possibility is that the rate measured was skewed low by considering only the visibility time of normal sne  ia .",
    "ignoring a significant population of subluminous sne  ia , which have short visibility times , will lower the derived rate .",
    "however , studies of local subluminous sne  ia show that they have an extremely low iron yield , @xmath114 ( e.g. , contardo et al . 2000 ) .",
    "thus , unless they are very common at @xmath11 , such sne are irrelevant for iron production in clusters .",
    "an interesting conclusion arises if we examine our results jointly with the results we report in a companion paper ( gal - yam & maoz 2003 ) .",
    "there , we find that some versions of cosmic sfh , combined with particular sn  ia delay times , are incompatible with the observed redshift distribution of sne  ia found by perlmutter et al .",
    "for example , if the cosmic sfr rises between @xmath115 and @xmath11 as sharply as implied by lilly et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and by hippelein et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and at @xmath116 as sharply as found by lanzetta et al . (",
    "2002 ) , then the observed sn  ia redshift distribution sets a 95%-confidence _ lower _ limit on the sn  ia delay time , of @xmath9  gyr .",
    "thus , if one had independent reasons to adopt this sfh scenario , _ and _ a cluster star - formation redshift @xmath5 ( the latter implying an _ upper _ limit of @xmath3  gyr at 95% confidence from the measured sn  ia rate ) , then _ all _ values of @xmath10 would be excluded .",
    "one would then be forced to the conclusion that sne  ia can not be the source of iron in clusters , leaving only the top - heavy imf option .",
    "to summarize , we have investigated the source of the total iron mass in rich galaxy clusters . using updated values for the various observational parameters , we have rederived and quantified the excess of iron over the expectation from core - collapse sne , provided the stars in cluster galaxies formed with a standard imf . assuming the source of the iron is from sne  ia",
    ", we then showed that the sn  ia rate vs. redshift can be predicted quite robustly , given two parameters  the star formation redshift in clusters , and the mean sn  ia delay time .",
    "we set constraints on these two parameters by comparing the predicted rates to the measurements of the sn  ia rate at @xmath11 by gal - yam et al .",
    "the low observed rates at @xmath11 force the iron - producing sne  ia to have occurred at higher redshifts .",
    "this implies an early epoch of star formation _ and _ a short delay time .",
    "specifically , we showed that models with a mean sn  ia delay time of @xmath3  gyr ( @xmath4  gyr ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) are ruled out at high confidence .",
    "thus , if other avenues of inquiry show that sne  ia explode via a mechanism that leads to a long delay time that is ruled out by our study , it will mean that core - collapse sne from a top - heavy imf must have formed the bulk of the observed mass of iron in clusters .",
    "the same conclusion will apply if other studies confirm a cosmic sfh that rises sharply with redshift . as shown in gal - yam & maoz ( 2003 ) , short ( @xmath117  gyr ) delay times are incompatible with such a sfh and the redshift distribution of field sne  ia .",
    "finally , we note that our results have relied on the upper limits on the @xmath118 cluster sn  ia rate , calculated by gal - yam et al .",
    "( 2002 ) based on just several sne .",
    "improved measurements of cluster sn rates at low , intermediate , and high redshifts can tighten the constraints significantly , and can potentially reveal the iron source directly .",
