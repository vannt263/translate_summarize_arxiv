    "three main radiation processes considered to account for the nonthermal x - ray emission in knots and hot spots of the extended jets discovered by the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ are synchrotron , synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) , and compton scattering of external photons contributed mostly by the cmbr ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in x - ray knots of quasar jets    with projected lengths @xmath2 kpc , where the x - ray spectrum is not a smooth extension of the radio / optical spectrum , a currently favored interpretation is the external compton ( ec ) model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the x - ray emission from knots such as wk7.8 of pks 0637 - 752 is argued to be due to cmb photons that are compton - upscattered by nonthermal electrons from kpc - scale emitting regions in bulk relativistic motion at distances up to several hundred kpc away from the central engine .",
    "we note , however , that in the framework of this model it is problematic to explain a clear trend observed from many extended jets of radio quasars , such as of 3c 273 @xcite or of pks 1127 - 145 @xcite , that the x - ray brightness of the knots decreases with distance along the jet while the radio flux is _ increasing_. the lorentz factors of the x - ray emitting electrons in the ec model are smaller than those of the radio- and optical - emitting electrons .",
    "it is therefore difficult to explain comparable knot sizes at optical and x - ray frequencies , but extended emission at radio frequencies .",
    "moreover , the radiative cooling of these low - energy electrons is slow , resulting in high total energy requirements .    in this paper , we examine these difficulties and propose an alternative interpretation for x - ray emission from knots in fr2 radio galaxy jets and quasars where the radio through x - ray fluxes are explained by synchrotron radiation from one or two components of relativistic electrons . both of these components are powered by neutral beams of ultra - high energy ( uhe ) neutrons and gamma - rays produced by the jet at the base of the central agn engine @xcite .",
    "the momentum of the decaying beam of neutrons drives a relativistic shock that accelerates electrons from the surrounding medium to produce the main nonthermal electron component responsible for the broad band radio / optical / x - ray synchrotron emission . in such sources ,",
    "a second ultra - relativistic lepton component can also be injected from neutron @xmath3 decay and the pair production by uhe @xmath4 rays attenuated by the cmbr .",
    "the synchrotron emission of these pairs can contribute to or even dominate the synchrotron x - ray flux in the knots of core - dominated quasars .",
    "here we focus on knots in quasar jets , though the same 2-component synchrotron model can apply to hot spots of fr2 galaxies such as cygnus a @xcite or pictor a @xcite , where the ssc process could also play a role . for the x - ray jets in fr1 sources , with projected lengths of only @xmath5 kpc , x - ray and optical emission are generally consistent with a smooth power - law continuation of the radio spectrum , indicating a synchrotron origin .",
    "mild spectral hardenings at x - ray energies , such as those observed in the knots of m87 s jet @xcite , could still be explained within the context of a single component synchrotron model ( dermer and atoyan , 2002 ; henceforth da02 ) . in fr1 galaxies and",
    "bl lac objects , the neutral beam power is considerably smaller than in fr2 galaxies and quasars because of the weaker external radiation field in the inner jet @xcite , so that extended jets in fr1 galaxies would primarily result from the jet plasma expelled directly from the central nucleus .    in section 2",
    "we discuss difficulties with the ec model , and we propose one- and two - component synchrotron models for the x - ray jets in section 3 .",
    "the rationale for the model is discussed in section 4 , including testable predictions from x - ray and high - energy neutrino observations and a brief discussion of this model in the context of a scenario for agn evolution .",
    "the principal reason for difficulties of the ec model is that the lorentz factors @xmath6 of electrons that produce x - rays by compton scattering on cmbr are rather small .",
    "electrons that produce synchrotron radio emission at observer - frame frequencies @xmath7 have comoving - frame lorentz factors @xmath8^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath9^{-1 } \\equiv 10 \\delta_{10}$ ] is the doppler factor of the emitting knot moving with lorentz factor @xmath10 at an angle @xmath11 to the observer , and @xmath12 g ) @xmath13 is a characteristic magnetic field in the knot derived from equipartition arguments",
    ". is always referred to the proper frame ] electrons that compton scatter the cmbr to observed x - ray energies @xmath14 have @xmath15 .",

    ", \\rm yr$ ] into the stationary frame , we find that for the x - ray emitting electrons , @xmath17 the coefficient in this timescale corresponds to a propagation distance of @xmath18 mpc , which is orders of magnitude larger than the jet extent .",
    "this implies a very inefficient extraction of the injected electron energy .",
    "note also that the efficiency for compton production of the observed x - ray flux can not be essentially improved by assuming @xmath19 , as suggested earlier @xcite , since @xmath20 for the energetically most favorable ( `` not debeamed '' ) orientation of the jet , as shown in the next section .",
    "this leads to large total energy requirements , as well as to a number of difficulties in the interpretation of spectra and spatial profiles and sizes of the resolved knots in the radio and x - ray domains .",
    "the total electron energy required to produce the @xmath21 x - ray flux @xmath22 can be calculated by noting that the comoving luminosity of a single electron with lorentz factor @xmath23 is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the comoving energy density of the cmbr when @xmath26 , and @xmath27 ergs @xmath28 is the local cmbr energy density .",
    "the comoving power @xmath29 ( see eq.[39 ] in @xcite ) , where @xmath30 is the total number of relativistic electrons with @xmath31 and @xmath32 cm is the luminosity distance .",
    "this gives for the total energy in the stationary frame @xmath33 @xmath34 note that this derivation takes into account the directionality of target photons when an isotropic radiation field in the stationary frame is transformed to the comoving frame @xcite .",
    "neglecting this effect gives results accurate within a factor of @xmath35 when @xmath36 , but can introduce large errors when @xmath37 .    the energy given in eq .",
    "( [ we ] ) accounts only for electrons with @xmath31 , and neglects protons normally required to ensure neutrality . since the proton energy even at rest is @xmath38 times larger than the comoving energy of electrons with @xmath39 , the total energy of particles @xmath40 is needed , unless @xmath41 pair - dominated plasma could be formed in the knot .",
    "@xcite argue , however , that quasar jets are composed of e - p plasma by comparing jet luminosities inferred from ssc models with the radio lobe powers .",
    "the total energy requirements can be reduced to values reasonable for x - ray knots with a typical size @xmath42 only by assuming @xmath43 . for a jet moving at an angle @xmath11 with respect to the line - of - sight",
    ", the maximum doppler factor is @xmath44 , which is reached if also @xmath45 .",
    "this implies very small inclination angles of jets up to @xmath46 in order to have @xmath47 .    for knot wk7.8 in pks 0637 - 752 at @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( for a @xmath50cdm cosmology with @xmath51 , @xmath52 and hubble constant of 70 km s@xmath53 mpc@xmath53 ) and @xmath54 ( from @xcite , including bolometric correction for the integral flux ) , equation ( [ we ] ) results in @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the stationary frame , if one assumes @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "for 3c 273 at @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the angle @xmath61 explains superluminal motion of the sub - pc jet @xcite , and it may be as large as @xmath62@xmath63 for the kpc - scale jet as deduced from polarization measurements by @xcite . even taking @xmath64 for knot a1 with measured bolometric flux @xmath65 in the kev region @xcite , the minimum electron energy when @xmath66 is @xmath67 for the chandra observations .",
    "this implies a total energy @xmath68 ergs in the stationary frame , or @xmath69 ergs in the comoving frame .    for an x - ray knot",
    "size @xmath70 , an equipartition magnetic field for the comoving energy @xmath71 is @xmath72 . for knot",
    "wk7.8 in pks 0637752 , the size @xmath73 corresponding to fhwm @xmath74 ( but not @xmath75 , as in @xcite , if one takes into account the redshift effect , @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 in case of @xmath78 .",
    "this results in the equipartition magnetic field @xmath79 ( instead of @xmath80 for 3@xmath81 larger knot size ) .",
    "this field is unacceptably high for the ec model because it would overproduce the observed radio flux , given the number of electrons with @xmath82 needed for the x - ray flux .",
    "however , in case of magnetic fields at the level of only a few tens of @xmath83 , the energy density , and thus the pressure , of relativistic particles would be much higher than the pressure of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore either the confinement time of electrons in the knot would be @xmath84 , or else the knot would be inflating on the same timescale .",
    "this implies a comoving injection power in the knot @xmath85 , or a stationary - frame injection power @xmath86 ergs s@xmath53 .",
    "in fact , taking into account contribution of protons , @xcite require a power of @xmath87 ergs s@xmath53 to model the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of knot wk7.8 of pks 0637 - 752 with the ec model .",
    "although they argue that this is consistent with total kinetic power of jets inferred to power the giant radio lobes of radio galaxies , the largest jet power in the sample of @xcite hardly exceeds @xmath88 ergs s@xmath53 .",
    "this power also is 12 orders of magnitude greater than the maximum peak @xmath4-ray luminosities inferred from egret observations of blazars , taking into account the likely beaming factor of @xmath89% @xcite .",
    "it should be noted here that in principal it is possible to satisfy the equipartition condition also for a given size @xmath90 of the knot wk7.8 , increasing the doppler factor @xmath91 further to @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "this will also minimize ( _ somewhat reducing _ ) the power requirements for the ec model @xcite .",
    "however , this is possible only if the jet inclination angle is further decreased to @xmath93 .",
    "although this can not be excluded for a particular source , such angles would be problematic to assume for many sources , as we discuss in section 4 .      in the ec / cmbr model ,",
    "x - rays are produced by electrons with @xmath94 in the stationary frame .",
    "they cool on the cmbr only on gyr timescales @xmath95 of eq.([tc ] ) , unless their overall cooling is dominated by synchrotron losses , which would then overproduce the observed radio flux at low frequencies .",
    "since the photon target for the compton process does not degrade at any distance @xmath96 from the parent agn , the strong fading of the x - ray knots and jet generally ( outside the knots ) with @xmath96 in many fr2 quasars , such as in 3c 273 @xcite , pks 1127 - 145 @xcite , or pictor a @xcite , implies either a fast decrease of the total number of electrons with @xmath97 or a decline of the jet doppler factor . because the observed radio emission is produced by electrons with @xmath98 larger than @xmath99 only by a factor @xmath100",
    ", both assumptions would imply a rapid fading of the radio brightness with distance as well . meanwhile , exactly the opposite radio brightness profiles are observed .",
    "secondly , because the cooling time is shorter for radio than for compton x - ray emitting electrons , one should also expect that the x - ray knots in the ec model would be more diffuse than the radio or optical knots .",
    "again , this prediction is in disagreement with observations .",
    "note in this regard that the adiabatic cooling of x - ray emitting electrons due to fast expansion of x - ray knots , as proposed recently @xcite for the interpretation of fading of the x - ray brightness outside the knots , would also equally impact the radio - emitting electrons @xcite .",
    "therefore this scenario would not resolve either of these two discrepancies between the x - ray and the radio brightness patterns .",
    "one more difficulty for the compton interpretation arises for those jets where the spectral indices @xmath101 ( for the spectral flux @xmath102 ) are significantly different at radio and x - ray frequencies .",
    "as also discussed earlier , e.  g. , by @xcite , spectral profiles steeper in x - rays than in radio , with @xmath103 , and especially jets / knots in a number of fr1 galaxies where @xmath104 , represent strong evidence for the synchrotron origin of the x - ray flux , implying acceleration of electrons with @xmath105 in the knots of radio jets .",
    "this also is the case for many terminal hot spots , such as the western hot spot of pictor a with @xmath106 and @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out here that these difficulties with the interpretation of different spectral and opposite spatial profiles in radio and x - ray patterns of jets relate not only to ec models , but equally to ssc models . the x - ray flux in ssc models is likewise produced by low - energy electrons that emit the synchrotron radio photons for subsequent compton interactions , and the density of this target does not decline , and may even increase , along the jet .",
    "in the x - ray jets of fr1 galaxies , such as 3c 66b @xcite and some knots in m87 s jet @xcite , the x - ray  optical ",
    "radio spectra are consistent with a single or smoothly steepening power - law spectrum , which is readily explained by a single - component synchrotron spectrum .",
    "it is a common pattern that the peaks of the emission of the knots and hot spots in the radio , optical , and x - ray domains of quasar jets are well correlated and often coincide , such as in the jet of 3c 273 @xcite .",
    "when the profiles do not coincide , as in the fr1 galaxy m87 @xcite or the gps quasar pks 1127 - 145 @xcite , the peak emission of the x - ray profile is closer to the core than the radio profile .",
    "this behavior suggests a common synchrotron origin for the radiation in all bands , where nonthermal electrons accelerated at a shock lose energy through adiabatic and radiative processes as they flow downstream from the shock .",
    "the synchrotron optical and x - ray emissions from the highest energy electrons have roughly coincident profiles , but the radio emission is far more extended due to the longer cooling timescale , and can even be offset as a consequence of a low - energy cutoff in the electron injection function .",
    "in apparent conflict with a synchrotron model are the seds of many quasar knots and hot spots that show a general behavior whereby the optical spectra are steeper than both the radio and the x - ray spectra , and the x - ray fluxes are above the extrapolation from the optical band .",
    "this behavior can not be immediately explained by a `` standard '' synchrotron model with a single power - law electron component .",
    "it apparently requires a second electron component at very high energies @xmath108 tev with a sharp cutoff at lower energies .",
    "however , the origin of such electrons in the knot was not easy to understand and obviously needs an explanation .      in our model ( da02 )",
    ", we have shown that in many cases even a single population of electrons with a power - law injection spectrum @xmath109 could explain the observed spectral peculiarities if the electrons are accelerated to sufficiently high energies with @xmath110 .",
    "when cmbr cooling in the thomson regime exceeds synchrotron cooling , i.  e. , when the magnetic and radiation field energy densities relate as @xmath111 , a hardening in the electron spectrum is formed at comoving electron energies @xmath112 , where kn effects in compton losses become important .",
    "the spectrum steepens again at higher energies when synchrotron losses take over . for @xmath113 up to few tens of @xmath114 , this condition is satisfied for jets with @xmath115 .",
    "such an effect produces a hardening in the synchrotron spectrum between optical and x - ray frequencies .    in fig .",
    "1 we show fits to the multiwavelength seds of knots a1 and b1 of the jet of 3c 273 , with deprojected length @xmath116 , calculated in the framework of a single - component synchrotron model ( da02 ) . for all knots , @xmath117 ( including the knot d / h3 ) , and practically all other model parameters",
    "are also the same .",
    "the single parameter which is different for the 3 curves is the time from the start of electron injection , which can also be interpreted as the different escape times of electrons from the knots .",
    "these times are given in the figure caption .",
    "the curves are are normalized to the observed x - ray fluxes at 1 kev .",
    "the total electron energies in knots a1 and b1 are @xmath118 and @xmath119 , and the required electron injection powers are @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "note that the spectra in fig .  1 are fitted for the jet inclination angle @xmath64 in 3c 273 . for the assumed lorentz factor @xmath122 ,",
    "this angle is much larger than the effective beaming angle of the inner jet emission @xmath123 , and results in @xmath124 . even for this strongly debeamed case ,",
    "the simple `` one - zone and single - component '' synchrotron model provides good fits to the observed fluxes of the knots a1 and b1 with still acceptable total energy requirements .",
    "the thin curves in fig .  1 show the fluxes to be expected from the ec process for the same model parameters .",
    "it follows from comparing these fluxes with the observed x - ray fluxes that for the given parameters of 3c 273 , the ec model would require 2 - 3 orders of magnitude more total energy for both knots a1 and b1 .",
    "even formally assuming an unreasonably large injection / escape time , however , it is not possible to explain the sed of the knot d / h3 in the framework of a single - component synchrotron model .",
    "the x - ray emission in knot d / h3 of 3c 273 , or generally in knots where either the optical flux is very steep , @xmath125 , or the energy flux @xmath126 is much higher in x - rays than in the optical band , can only be explained by synchrotron radiation either as a second component of electrons or , as another possibility , synchrotron emission of uhe protons with @xmath127 and magnetic fields as strong as @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "the energy requirements of the proton synchrotron model are as demanding as of the compton model . in this model",
    ", kev radiation is produced by protons with comoving lorentz factors @xmath129^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the synchrotron cooling time of these protons @xmath130 which , in the stationary frame , is @xmath131 comparing this time with eq .",
    "( [ tc ] ) shows that the energy required in uhe protons alone in the knot should be practically as large as in electrons with @xmath132 in the ec model . at the same time",
    ", one also has to assume that only a small amount of energy is injected in radio electrons in order not to overproduce the observed radio flux in the high magnetic field in the knot .    the origin of the second electron component to produce x - ray synchrotron radiation in a leptonic model may , however , seem ad hoc .",
    "noticeably , this second electron component should be concentrated mostly at multi - tev and higher energies , with a cutoff at energies below @xmath133 , or otherwise the synchrotron flux of this component would exceed the observed flux in the optical band .",
    "after discussing in this section the requirements and demonstrating the feasibility of a two - component synchrotron model , we propose a scenario for the origin of the second component in section 3.3 .    in fig .",
    "2 we show a fit to the sed of knot wk7.8 of pks 0637 - 752 , calculated in the framework of a 2-component synchrotron model . we assume a power - law spectrum with @xmath134 to fit the radio spectrum , and an exponential cutoff above @xmath135 , which explains the steep optical flux .",
    "the injection spectrum of the second electron component has a power - law index @xmath136 , with exponential cutoffs below @xmath137 and above @xmath138 .",
    "the synchrotron radiation of this second electron component is shown by the heavy dashed curve for an escape time @xmath139kyr .",
    "for comparison , the thin short dashed curve shows the evolution of the fluxes in case of a larger escape time of the electrons from the knot , with @xmath140kyr . as can be seen , further increase of this parameter beyond @xmath141yr when @xmath142 would result in the synchrotron flux of the rapidly cooling second electron component exceeding the observed flux in the optical band .",
    "longer escape / injection times @xmath143 are allowed for smaller magnetic fields @xmath144 in knot wk7.8 .",
    "the interpretation of these timescales when @xmath145-@xmath146 suggests that x - ray knots are manifestations of relativistic shock waves , with transverse size scales of kpc dimensions , that are moving towards us ( though generally at some angle @xmath147-@xmath148 ) with @xmath149 .",
    "these shocks accelerate electrons and can amplify the magnetic field in the downstream flow . in the shocked material , the relativistic plasma expands at speeds close to @xmath150 ( in the shock frame ) .",
    "then the escape times @xmath151 would imply an effective thickness of the region with enhanced magnetic fields downstream of the shock equal to about @xmath152 .",
    "this is comparable with the given transverse size of the shock , and therefore even a smaller escape times could be still reasonable .",
    "it is important that the energy requirements derived for the first and second electron components are low . for the assumed parameters of knot wk7.8 , the total comoving energies in the first components is @xmath153 , and only @xmath154 in the second component .",
    "the energetics @xmath155 of the first component is contributed mostly by radio - emitting electrons which cool slowly and can be accumulated in a larger region over a longer time than @xmath156kyr assumed in fig .",
    "2 . comparing the ec flux shown by the thin solid line with the observed x - ray flux , one can see that the chosen parameters for knot wk7.8 would require in the ec model a total energy budget larger by 2 orders of magnitude than found in fig .  2 , namely @xmath157 .",
    "it would also require a magnetic field well below the near - equipartition value assumed in fig .  2 in order to reduce the radio emissivity .    for the fast - cooling second component of electrons , a more informative measure than @xmath158 is the comoving injection power , or injection `` luminosity '' @xmath159 .",
    "the model fit to the observed x - ray flux in fig .",
    "2 requires @xmath160 .",
    "this luminosity implies that electrons with average lorentz factor @xmath161 are injected at the rate @xmath162 because of relativistic time contraction @xmath163 , this injection rate becomes even smaller in the stationary frame , @xmath164 .",
    "the steep spectra of the first electron component with power - law injection index @xmath165 needed to explain the radio fluxes of the knot wk7.8 imply that the shock is not very strong .",
    "this is in a good agreement with the relatively low value of the characteristic maximum energy for the first electron component which is @xmath166 in fig .  2 .",
    "but then the production of a second electron component reaching much higher energies appears to be problematic .",
    "the problem is solved if the second electron component is not accelerated by the shock , but rather is swept up in the upstream plasma .",
    "spectra of electrons of the type required , with a sharp cutoff below multi - tev energies , could appear in knots at distances from a few tens to @xmath167 from the decaying neutral beam of uhe neutrons and gamma - rays produced in the relativistic compact jet of agn at sub - pc scales , as we have recently suggested @xcite .",
    "the total power transported by such a beam in fr2 quasars to distances 0.1 - 1 mpc can be very significant . the energy released in uhe neutrons at energies @xmath168-@xmath169ev can reach a few to several per cent of the entire energy of protons accelerated by the inner jet @xcite .",

    "if an amount of energy @xmath183 in uhe neutrons is ejected from the central engine during a period @xmath184 of high - state activity , then these neutrons will form a slab of @xmath185 length moving along the jet at nearly the speed of light .",
    "the production power of uhe neutrons @xmath186 could be provided if the total power of acceleration of protons in the agn core would be @xmath187 .",

    "these electrons are produced with lorentz factors @xmath190 at distances @xmath191 ( see atoyan & dermer , 2003 ) .",
    "because of the relativistic klein - nishina ( kn ) effect , the efficiency of the electromagnetic cascade of these leptons on the cmbr is essentially suppressed in an ambient magnetic field as low as @xmath192 .",

    "@xcite have assumed a jet with magnetic field of order @xmath196 ( which is needed for effective synchrotron radiation ) , but which is extremely well aligned , such that the perpendicular component of the field is very small , @xmath197 .    in our model , where the flux detected from x - ray knots",
    "is produced in the downstream regions of the forward shocks , we can allow significantly less ordered magnetic fields in the upstream region of the shock , with @xmath198 .",
    "in this case the efficiency of compton emission which defines the efficiency of the cascade of pairs with initial lorenz factors @xmath199 would be only @xmath200 . the energy of injected uhe pairs , however , is orders of magnitude larger than the energy @xmath201 of @xmath188-@xmath189 pairs effectively produced _ in _ the cascade .",
    "furthermore , the efficiency of the compton process dramatically rises when the synchrotron losses bring the injected electrons ( of both signs ) closer to @xmath202 .",
    "this implies that the number of electrons produced from a single initial uhe @xmath4-ray photon could be significantly larger than the number of @xmath3-decay electrons .",

    "note that our model does not require an extremely ordered magnetic field along the jet , although stretching of the pre - existing intergalactic magnetic field along the jet is a very plausible outcome of the decaying neutral beam and appearance of the beam of charged uhe secondaries driving the extended jet . because the time of injection for different electrons would be different , a broad spectrum of ultrarelativistic @xmath188-@xmath208 pairs up to their energy at production , will be overtaken .",
    "the enhanced magnetic field downstream of the shock results in rapid radiative losses , a `` lighting up '' these electrons and the appearance of an x - ray knot .    in case of @xmath209 ,",
    "the cooling synchrotron spectrum with @xmath210 is produced .",
    "a small contribution of electrons from the pair - photon cascade on the cmbr , as discussed above , could effectively result in @xmath211 .",
    "it may also be the result of higher @xmath212 and longer cooling time @xmath213 , which in principle could reach @xmath214yrs at @xmath215 distances .",
    "in that case steeper synchrotron spectra at kev energies will be produced , as in fig .",
    "the external compton model for extended x - ray jets faces difficulties with large energy requirements , and in explaining the different spatial profiles at radio , optical , and x - ray frequencies .",

    "although we can not exclude that the number of x - ray jets with such small angles could still be significant , the probability for one of the 2 jets of any quasar to be directed within such an angle is only @xmath218 . allowing for x - ray jets with @xmath219 will increase the probability to detect several such sources by several orders of magnitude . a common model for x - ray knots would then have to be able to deal with sufficiently large @xmath11 and to allow debeamed jets with @xmath220 .",
    "the energy demands for such jets become unrealistic in the ec model .",
    "the large energy requirements are significantly relaxed for synchrotron models .",
    "synchrotron x - rays are produced by very high energy electrons with short cooling times , which minimizes the injection power of electrons needed to explain the x - ray flux .",
    "for a two - component synchrotron model , unlike for the ec model , the magnetic field is not limited by the ratio of x - ray to radio fluxes and a given inclination angle ( obtained , for example , by fixing the maximum possible dopler factor ) .",
    "this minimizes the total energy accumulated in the form of radio emitting electrons and magnetic fields in the knot needed to explain the observed radio flux .",
    "the comoving equipartition fields in fr2 knots are typically at the level @xmath221@xmath222 , which are higher than @xmath223-@xmath224 deduced from ec models .",
    "the synchrotron interpretation of x - rays also allows one to have significantly debeamed jets and still remain within an acceptable range for the energy budget , as in the knots of 3c 273 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the relative advantage of synchrotron models for debeamed jets with @xmath225 is due essentially to the more narrow beaming diagram for the ec radiation than for the synchrotron radiation in the stationary frame @xcite .",
    "this is the case when the photons are detected at an angle @xmath226 . in the comoving frame",
    "such photons are produced in compton ` tail - on ' collisions with beamed ( in the comoving frame ) external photons at angles @xmath227 ; therefore the efficiency of the compton process is strongly reduced .",
    "in the meantime , synchrotron radiation production in a quasi - isotropic knot magnetic field is isotropic in the comoving frame .",
    "the steeper sed in the optical than x - ray bands in some knots , as a1 or b1 knots of 3c 273 in fig .  1 , can be explained in the framework of a single population of electrons accelerated to multi - tev energies in the shocks forming the knots ( da02 ) .",
    "the two - component synchrotron model appears more general . in particular",
    ", it can explain practically all types of seds detected from the knots and hot spots of multi - kpc scale jets of fr2 radio galaxies , such as the knot wk7.8 of pks 637 - 752 where the optical flux is a factor @xmath228 times below the power - law extrapolation of fluxes from the radio to x - ray bands .",
    "we have argued that the origins of the two different components in the knots and hot spots of fr2 jets can be naturally explained within a unified model for large scale jets as manifestations of neutral beams @xcite .",
    "these beams , composed of uhe neutrons , gamma - rays and neutrinos , are efficiently produced in the compact relativistic jets of fr2 quasars by accelerated uhe protons in the process of photomeson interactions with the accretion disk radiation on @xmath175 pc scales .",
    "the decay of uhe neutrons deposits momentum and energy of the neutral beam into the intergalactic medium , and drives surrounding plasma to relativistic motion ( presumably with moderately relativistic speeds , though this will require a hydrodynamic study to quantify ) through interactions with ambient magnetic fields and the generation of plasma waves .",
    "the appearance of knots in continuous jets could be manifestations of shocks resulting from the increased activity of the central engine during some time in the past @xcite .",
    "the first population of electrons is produced in the process of first - order fermi acceleration of electrons from the surrounding intergalactic medium .",
    "the radio electrons cool slowly ; therefore they drift and accumulate along the jet , which explains the increase of radio brightness .",
    "a second population of electrons in the jet originates in the decay of uhe gamma - rays with lorentz factors @xmath229 @xcite , and can be contributed even by @xmath3 electrons from neutron decay .",
    "it is essential that the production spectrum of these electrons is cut off at lower energies , @xmath230 . because of",
    "the strong klein - nishina effect for the compton radiation of uhe electrons , most of the electron energy will be deposited in the form of synchrotron radiation at mev / gev energies in ambient fields @xmath231 g .",
    "this radiation can be effectively lost for an observer outside of the jet opening angle .",
    "these electrons will be cooled down to energies @xmath232 before being overtaken by the relativistic shock .",
    "reprocessing of even a small fraction of the @xmath4-ray beam energy in the pair - photon cascade along the jet , however , will result in a very significant contribution to the total number of uhe electrons , with a broad spectrum above @xmath233 and a cutoff at lower energies .",
    "these electrons are deposited throughout the length of the jet , and will be found , in particular , in the jet fluid in front of the shock .",
    "convection of these electrons downstream of the shock with enhanced magnetic field results in a second synchrotron component that can explain the anomalously hard x - ray seds of many knots .",
    "note that this component of electrons is re - energized at the shock front in the process of adiabatic compression .",
    "moreover , because of the high efficiency of synchrotron radiation , in many cases even the energy of the neutral beam deposited in the @xmath3-decay electrons alone could be sufficient for the explanation of the low x - ray fluxes observed .",
    "we note that mhd waves excited by the beam , as in the shear boundary layer model of @xcite , could also contribute to the reacceleration and energization of a hard electron component .",
    "the decline of the deposition rate of uhe electrons with distance @xmath96 from the agn core could be as fast as @xmath234 in case of a dominant @xmath3-decay electron contribution .",
    "the decline could be somewhat slower in the case of a significant contribution from pair - photon cascades of uhe electrons .",
    "this would then explain the fast decline of x - ray emission of knots along the jet .",
    "the final hot spot in our model would represent a termination shock of the relativistic flow when the jet runs out of uhe neutral - beam decay products that sustain the forward progress of the relativistic jet into the ambient medium .",
    "compression and additional acceleration of the second component of electrons ( cooled down to @xmath235 on timescales up to @xmath236 for hot spots at distances @xmath237 ) and the increase of the magnetic field in the downstream region of this relativistic jet termination shock can explain the spectrum of the hot spot of pictor a with @xmath238 .",
    "for very distant quasars with @xmath239 , such as reported recently @xcite , an additional powerful channel contributing to the second electron component in large scale jet appears . at such redshifts , the photomeson interaction length of super - gzk neutrons becomes comparable with and even less than the mpc scale of the jets . in this case",
    ", the input from the super - gzk neutron component of the uhe neutral beam and the efficiency of the electromagnetic cascade will increase dramatically . in this way , the increased energy density of the cmbr can explain the detectability of x - rays even from quasars at large redshifts ( compare different ideas by @xcite for the ec model ) .",
    "we propose two testable predictions of this scenario .",
    "the first is variability of the x - ray flux from the knots of fr2 radio galaxies .",
    "this possibility , suggested by observations of x - ray variability in the knots of m87 @xcite , is a consequence of the short cooling time scale @xmath240yr of x - ray emitting electrons . for the comoving magnetic fiels in the knots ( and hot spots ) reaching @xmath241 this time can be @xmath242 even for knots / jets with moderate doppler factors @xmath243 moving at rather large angles @xmath219 .",
    "one could then expect that variations of the injection rate of electrons at the shock ( swept up in the upstream region ) on time scales @xmath244 would result in variations of the x - ray flux on the same scales .",
    "detection of variability could be feasible for x - rays knots with transverse sizes @xmath245kpc , but which are sufficiently thin ( flat ) along our line - of - sight .",
    "the detection of a small - amplitude variability ( at the level of up to several per cent over reasonable observation times ) variability depends on the strength of the magnetic field downstream of the shock . for knots detected with _ chandra _ at the x - ray count rates @xmath2 per hour , like from knot wk7.8 in pks 0637 - 752 @xcite , simple estimates show that a statistically significant flux variations could be expected for observations separated by several years .",
    "x - ray variability of an fr2 knot or hot spot would be difficult to understand in the context of the ec model with the large cooling times of the emitting electrons and stationary target for compton interactions .",
    "a second prediction is that high - energy ( @xmath246 ev ) neutrinos will be detected from core - dominated quasars with km - scale neutrino telescopes such as icecube .",
    "detection of every such neutrino from a flat spectrum radio quasar such as 3c 279 implies that a total energy @xmath247 is injected in the inner jet at sub - kpc scales @xcite .",
    "therefore even the detection of 1 neutrino per year would imply an uhe neutral beam power @xmath248 .",
    "finally , we note that this model is developed in view of a scenario @xcite where radio loud agns are formed by merging ir luminous galaxies , and evolve from a high luminosity fr2/quasar phase at early cosmic times to a lower luminosity fr1/bl lac phase at later times , thus explaining the sequence of flat - spectrum radio quasar and bl lac object seds @xcite .",
    "the crucial feature in this scenario is the amount of broad - line emitting gas that fuels the agn , and the corresponding intensities of the external radiation field in the vicinity of the inner jet .",
    "this radiation field determines the power of the neutral beam that produces the distinctive lobe - dominated morphologies of fr2 radio galaxies and , in exceptional cases such as pictor a , a linear jet @xcite .",
    "fr1 galaxies , where the neutral beam power is negligible , consequently display very different radio jet morphologies .    0.5 in we thank herman marshall , eric perlman , and andrew wilson for comments and discussions , and the referee for useful comments .",
