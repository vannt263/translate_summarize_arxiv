    "the scale of the unification of gravity with the other interactions is expected to be near the planck scale of @xmath2 gev .",
    "this is far out of reach of any future accelerators and thus is not directly experimentally accessible .",
    "however , the nonlocality of string theory leads to the possibility that lorentz and cpt symmetry violations might exist at that scale @xcite , and hence high - precision studies of these symmetries might be able to probe planck - scale physics .",
    "it is difficult to write the most general lorentz and cpt violating theory  even the meaning of a lagrangian becomes questionable in such a theory .",
    "however , with some reasonable assumptions , one can study lorentz and cpt violation . to develop a framework for studying lorentz and cpt violation in the standard model , colladay and kosteleck",
    "@xcite constructed the standard model extension ( sme ) .",
    "this is a theory based on the standard model but which includes additional lorentz and cpt violating terms .",
    "these terms satisfy the @xmath3 gauge symmetry of the standard model , and they also satisfy invariance under observer lorentz transformations @xcite .",
    "this means that any lorentz indices that the additional term contains must be contracted ( i.e. , it must be an observer lorentz scalar ) , and that rotations and boosts of the observer inertial frame do not affect the physics .",
    "this ensures that the physics does not depend on the choice of coordinates .",
    "in addition , the lorentz violation is assumed independent of position and time , and thus energy and momentum are conserved .",
    "the lorentz - violating terms considered in the sme violate invariance under particle lorentz transformations , i.e. under rotations and boost of a particle within a fixed observer inertial frame .",
    "an example of two such terms in the pure electron sector is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .",
    "this term is clearly @xmath6 invariant , and the coefficients are position - independent , but @xmath7 and @xmath8 are constant vectors and do not transform under a particle lorentz transformation .",
    "it should be noted that this is the `` minimal '' extension .",
    "non - minkowski spacetimes @xcite will lead to spacetime - dependent coefficients , and some models can lead to nonrenormalizable terms .",
    "such minimal extensions are beyond the scope of this paper .    in the sme ,",
    "the additional terms in the higgs sector are given by @xcite @xmath9-\\frac{1}{2 } k_{\\phi       b}^{\\mu\\nu}\\phi^{\\dagger}\\phi b_{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac{1}{2}k_{\\phi       w}^{\\mu\\nu}\\phi^{\\dagger}w_{\\mu\\nu}\\phi\\,,\\label{laglv}\\ ] ] and @xmath10 here , we have broken the @xmath11 term up into its real symmetric and imaginary antisymmetric parts .",
    "note that the @xmath12 and @xmath13 coefficients are real antisymmetric , the cpt even coefficients are all dimensionless , and the complex - valued cpt odd coefficient has units of mass .    to our knowledge , there are no published limits on the possible values of these coefficients .",
    "the purpose of this article is to explore the current bounds on these terms . in section",
    "ii , we consider the bounds on the cpt - even antisymmetric coefficients , @xmath14 and @xmath13 . in section iii ,",
    "the bounds of the cpt - even symmetric coefficients @xmath15 are determined , and the bounds on the cpt - odd coefficient , @xmath16 are discussed in section iv . section v contains our conclusions and a summary of the bounds .",
    "whenever new particles or new interactions are proposed , there are two approaches to discovery .",
    "one can look for direct detection of these particles or interactions ( as in searches for supersymmetric particles or for flavor - changing neutral currents ) .",
    "alternatively , one can look at the loop effects of the new physics on lower energy processes , such as in precision electroweak measurements . in studying the above coefficients",
    ", direct detection would necessitate producing large numbers of higgs bosons , and the resulting bounds would be quite weak .",
    "however , there are extremely stringent bounds on lorentz violation at low energies , and thus searching for the effects of these new interactions through loop effects will provide the strongest bounds .",
    "the most promising of these effects will be on the photon propagator .    in this section",
    ", we will consider the bounds on the cpt - even antisymmetric coefficients , @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "these interactions will lead to modified vertices and propagators , and will thus affect the one - loop photon propagator .",
    "we first look at the most general cpt - even photon propagator , and then relate the @xmath17 coefficients to the lorentz - violating terms in the photon propagator .",
    "then , the experimental constraints on such terms lead directly to stringent bounds on the @xmath17 coefficients .",
    "we then consider the @xmath12 and @xmath13 coefficients .    considering cpt - even terms",
    "only , the photon lagrangian can be written as @xcite @xmath18 here @xmath19 has the symmetries of the riemann tensor plus a double - traceless constraint , giving 19 independent parameters .",
    "the equation of motion from this lagrangian is @xmath20 where @xmath21 the propagator is clearly gauge invariant ( recall that @xmath22 is antisymmetric under exchange of the first or last two indices ) .    to bound the coefficients",
    ", we calculate the vacuum polarization diagrams for the photon propagator , using the full lagrangian , including lorentz - violating terms .",
    "the result will be of the form of the above propagator , and one can read off the value of @xmath22 . note that while the @xmath23 structure is mandated by gauge invariance , the @xmath22 term is separately gauge invariant and may differ order by order in perturbation theory . for simplicity , we look at the divergent parts of the one loop diagrams only . consideration of higher orders and finite parts will give similar , although not necessarily identical , results .",
    "in general , due to the large number of lorentz - violating terms , this yields a bound in a multidimensional parameter space .",
    "however , if we do not consider the possibility of fine - tuning , then we can consider each of the possible terms independently .",
    "one must keep in mind that some of the parameters may be related by a symmetry , but absent such a symmetry , we expect no high - precision cancellations .",
    "we begin by considering the antisymmetric part of @xmath11 , and then @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    to calculate the additional vacuum polarization diagrams for the photon propagator due to a non - zero @xmath24-term in eq .",
    "( [ laglv ] ) ( assuming all other parameters are zero ) , we need to find the vertices and propagators which are dependent on @xmath24 . for our purpose , vertices involving at least one photon field",
    "are necessary .",
    "two of them , for instance , can be quoted here : the @xmath25 $ ] coupling is given by @xmath26 $ ] . here",
    "all momenta are taken towards the vertex , and @xmath27 is the usual charged goldstone boson .",
    "as in the conventional sm , one can choose acceptable gauge - fixing conditions to remove the redundant degrees of freedom from the theory .",
    "in the sm , the following conditions in the @xmath28-gauge can be chosen @xcite @xmath29 for @xmath30 case and @xmath31 for @xmath32 case , where @xmath33 is the @xmath34 coupling constant , @xmath35 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the higgs doublet and vacuum expectation value , respectively",
    ". then the gauge - fixing term in the lagrangian is @xmath38 and this removes the mixing term between @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the sme , we have additional mixing proportional to @xmath24",
    ". a simple generalization of the above gauge - fixing conditions , by adding a @xmath41 term to @xmath42 and a similar @xmath43 to the function @xmath44 , would remove such lorentz - violating mixing in our case as well",
    ". however , such generalization also leads to an unwanted mixing between the gauge boson @xmath45 and the derivative of the higgs field , @xmath46 , which is contracted with @xmath47 , as well as substantially complicating the photon propagator .",
    "instead we use a mixed propagator of the form @xmath48 for @xmath49 fields ( that is , we are treating the mixing term as an interaction , which leads to diagrams like ( d),(e),(g ) , and ( h ) in fig .",
    "[ oneloop ] ) .",
    "here we use the convention that the 4-momentum @xmath50 of @xmath51 is incoming to the point where the field turns into a charged goldstone boson .",
    "another distinct feature of this model is the presence of a term of the form @xmath52 .",
    "this term needs to be considered carefully .",
    "it obviously represents a new term in the w - propagator .",
    "we will discuss how to deal with this term in the @xmath53-gauge , although we use t hooft - feynman gauge ( @xmath54 ) in our vacuum polarization calculations .",
    "since this mixing term can be considered an interaction , one can carry out the dyson summation . if we pick up the quadratic terms in the w - boson from the lagrangian together with @xmath55 , we have @xmath56 , where @xmath57\\equiv ik^{(0)\\mu\\nu}(q)-m_w^2(k_{\\phi\\phi}^{a})^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] . we know",
    "that the inverse of @xmath58 , say @xmath59 ( that is , @xmath60 ) , is the usual propagator for the w boson . from @xmath61",
    ", one can write the form of the propagator as @xmath62 , where all @xmath63 dependence is in the second term . to determine @xmath64",
    ", we can use the fact that @xmath65 is the inverse of @xmath66 . from this equation",
    ", one gets @xmath67 $ ] . iterating this equation , one obtains a series .",
    "however , we know that @xmath63 parameters are small , so it is sufficient to keep the first few terms . up to second order , it is straightforward to show that @xmath68 . in the t hooft - feynman gauge",
    "the propagator has a simple form which can be given as @xmath69 where , for example , the second term is represented as a blob in the @xmath70-propagator in fig .",

    "we are now ready to calculate the vacuum polarization diagrams for the photon propagator .",
    "it is useful to classify contributions as the ones having first order @xmath63-dependence and the ones with quadratic in @xmath63 .",
    "the only possible structure in first order is @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the lorentz index of the incoming(outgoing ) photon field .",
    "if we add all possible one - loop diagrams , the first order contributions vanish .",
    "this is expected from the gauge invariance requirement .",
    "it is not difficult to show that getting a gauge invariant transverse structure is only possible with at least two @xmath63-terms . in fig .",
    "[ oneloop ] , we depict the one - loop diagrams which , when permutations are added , give second order lorentz - violating inclusions .",
    "there are two possible structures in second order , which are either @xmath73 or @xmath74 . here",
    "@xmath75 is the four momentum of the external photons .",
    "again the first possibility is not gauge invariant and should vanish , thus contributions from the third term in eq .",
    "( [ propw ] ) should vanish .",
    "we have verified this explicitly .",
    "the latter is gauge invariant and gives a non - zero contribution ( if we contract with any of two external momenta of photons , @xmath76 or @xmath77 , it vanishes due to the antisymmetry property of @xmath78 ) .",
    "-6.5 cm    6.5 in    -7.8 cm    calculating the one - loop diagrams , and comparing with eq .",
    "( [ photprop ] ) , we find that the components of @xmath19 can simply be expressed in terms of @xmath63 as @xmath79 .",
    "we now turn to the experimental bounds on the @xmath22 .",
    "the dimensionless coefficient @xmath80 has the symmetries of the riemann tensor and a vanishing double trace , resulting in nineteen independent elements .",
    "following kosteleck and mewes @xcite , we can express these elements in terms of four traceless @xmath81 matrices and one coefficient : @xmath82 where @xmath83    there are stringent astrophysical bounds on 10 of the 19 elements , those given by @xmath84 and by @xmath85 .",
    "these astrophysical bounds have been discussed recently in detail by kosteleck and mewes @xcite .",
    "the observations of radiation propagating in free space over astrophysical distances results in bounds on these elements from velocity and birefringence constraints @xcite .",
    "the bound from birefringence constraints is the strongest , and is given by @xmath86 .",
    "the bounds on the remaining 9 elements are much weaker ( and in fact can be moved into the fermion sector , as will be discussed below ) .",
    "if one of our coefficients is nonzero , say @xmath87 , then the only nonzero components of @xmath22 are the @xmath88 and @xmath89 components .",
    "this leads to a nonzero @xmath84 matrix , and thus the stringent bounds apply . extending",
    "this one can see that for any single or possible combination of non - zero elements of @xmath90 it is impossible for both @xmath84 and @xmath85 to be null matrices , and thus the birefringence constraints apply .    one cautionary note should be added . in the above example",
    ", the @xmath22 tensor is not double traceless , since @xmath91 is proportional to @xmath92 .",
    "this means that the kinetic energy for the photon has not been properly normalized . by adding and subtracting a term proportional to the double trace @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a constant and",
    "the primed indices are summed only over the nonzero elements ( in the above example , only over @xmath95 ) .",
    "a redefinition of the photon field will give a conventional kinetic term , and the remaining terms obey the double traceless condition if one chooses a suitable @xmath94 value .",
    "this means that , although we started with only a @xmath96 term ( plus permutations ) , we also have @xmath97 and @xmath98 terms ( plus permutations ) .",
    "nonetheless it will still not be possible for the elements of @xmath84 and @xmath85 to become zero , hence these redefinitions do not affect the bounds . from these results",
    ", we find an upper bound of @xmath99 for the @xmath63 coefficients , barring , of course , fine - tuned cancellations .",
    "next , we consider the @xmath12-term by setting all other parameters to zero in eq .",
    "( [ laglv ] ) .",
    "this term has a interesting new interaction @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the standard model higgs boson .",
    "there also exists a similar lorentz - violating vertex with the neutral goldstone boson , @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , in addition to the charged goldstone loop , we have diagrams like fig . [ oneloop](a ) , which are second order in @xmath12 with different vertex factors , where now the particles circulating in the loop are the higgs and the would - be goldstone bosons .",
    "the coupling is @xmath103 , where @xmath75 is the four momentum of the photon . unlike the @xmath63 case",
    ", we obviously do nt have an additional mixing between the @xmath70 and charged goldstone bosons ( thus , no diagrams like ( d),(e),(g ) , and ( h ) in fig .",
    "[ oneloop ] ) .",
    "but this new term induces a remarkable mixing between the photon and the higgs scalar , since when the higgs gets a vacuum expectation value , an @xmath104 mixing term appears .",
    "this term ca nt be removed by gauge - fixing , and represents a mixed propagator . in our one - loop calculation of the photon propagator ,",
    "however , the mixing will not contribute to the divergent part , and is thus not relevant term could contribute , namely in the @xmath105 and @xmath106 effective vertices .",
    "however , the bounds we obtain below render any such effects negligible . ] .",
    "therefore , if we look at the structures in the first and the second order in @xmath12 , there exist @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "note that only the scalar loop diagrams with two lorentz - violating vertices yields the last structure ( three scalar loop diagrams with charged goldstone @xmath27 , higgs boson @xmath110 , and would - be neutral goldstone boson @xmath102 ) .",
    "gauge invariance makes us expect that the first two non - invariant structures should vanish and this is indeed the case .",
    "so , in this framework , the @xmath111 equality holds .",
    "numerically , the bound on the individual @xmath12 is stronger than that for @xmath78 by a factor of @xmath112 .",
    "this gives the upper bound on @xmath12 of @xmath113 .",
    "the @xmath13 term has very similar features to the @xmath17 case except for the photon - higgs mixing .",
    "it additionally allows the lorentz - violating @xmath114 vertex , which is equal to @xmath115 ( leading to diagrams like fig .",
    "[ oneloop](a ) with @xmath110 second order in @xmath13 ) .",
    "adapting the same gauge - fixing conditions of @xmath17 , one can show that the w - propagator with one @xmath13 inclusion becomes @xmath116 .",
    "computation of diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ oneloop](a)-(i ) plus their permutations ) shows us the @xmath117 , and @xmath118 structures in the first order and @xmath119 and @xmath120 in the second order .",
    "the only surviving term is the last one which is gauge - invariant .",
    "consequently , like the @xmath12 case , a very similar relation between @xmath19 and @xmath13 , @xmath121 , yields an upper bound of @xmath122 .",
    "it is seen that the current bound on all three lorentz - violating coefficients is of the order of @xmath123 .",
    "in this section , we consider bounds on the @xmath15 coefficients . in this case ,",
    "the strongest bounds come from relating , through field redefinitions , these coefficients to other lorentz violating coefficients in the fermion sector , and then using previously determined bounds on those coefficients .",
    "once one extends a model by relaxing one or more symmetry properties of the original model , the extended model should involve all possible otherwise invariant structures .",
    "however , if the modification is carried out under the assumption that the fields are transformed under this otherwise broken symmetry group in the usual way , not all of new parameters representing apparent violation of this symmetry may be physical ( i.e. the model has some redundant parameters ) .",
    "therefore an extension should be carefully analyzed to check for redundant parameters .",
    "this analysis may yield several lagrangians which are equivalent to each other by some coordinate and field redefinitions and rescalings @xcite .",
    "the same situation applies to the sme case .",
    "a simple example is provided by colladay and kosteleck @xcite .",
    "consider the electron in qed , with the kinetic term @xmath124 .",
    "suppose one transforms the electron field as @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is a constant vector .",
    "this is not a gauge transformation , since @xmath127 is not changed .",
    "plugging into the kinetic term , one finds a term @xmath128 . but",
    "this is one of the lorentz - violating terms mentioned in the first section , and thus this term can have no physical effect",
    ". other field redefinitions can eliminate ( or , more precisely , make redundant ) other possible terms .",
    "recently , the spinor part of the extended qed has been extensively discussed by colladay and mcdonald @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 term need not be redundant if gravity is included .",
    "this has been explored @xcite by studying the sme with gravity in the context of riemann - cartan spacetimes , and thus new lorentz - violating coefficients appear in such a framework .    in the higgs sector",
    ", one can also make some of the symmetric coefficients redundant .",
    "here we just consider the @xmath32 part but the generalization to @xmath129 is straightforward .",
    "a toy model discussed in @xcite is relevant to our purpose .",
    "consider first a model involving only two lorentz - violating parameters @xmath11 and @xmath19 in the scalar and photon sectors , respectively .",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath130(d^{\\mu}\\phi)^ { \\dagger}d^{\\nu}\\phi - m^2\\phi^{\\dagger}\\phi-\\frac{1}{4}f_{\\mu\\nu}f^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac{1}{4}(k_f)_{\\mu\\lambda\\lambda^{\\prime}\\nu}f^{\\mu\\lambda}f^{\\lambda^ { \\prime}\\nu}$ ] , where @xmath131 and @xmath11 is real and symmetric .",
    "first let us assume that only one component of @xmath11 , @xmath132 , is nonzero @xcite and that @xmath22 is taken as zero . by making the coordinate transformations @xmath133 , @xmath134 and the field redefinitions @xmath135 , @xmath136 with rescaling of the electric charge @xmath137 ,",
    "one gets the lagrangian @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the electric(magnetic ) field .",
    "so , we start with a system having a lorentz violation in the scalar sector ( @xmath140 ) and end up with an equivalent lagrangian involving lorentz violation in photon sector ( some components of @xmath19 are nonzero ) .",
    "second we can further show that by choosing only @xmath141 nonzero it is still possible to get an equivalent lagrangian as @xmath142 under the transformations @xmath143 , @xmath144 and the redefinitions @xmath145 , @xmath146 with the same charge rescaling @xmath137 .",
    "however , for the other components of @xmath11 , there are no such obvious transformations .",
    "another analysis of the physical effects of the lorentz - violating coefficients @xmath15 can be found by looking at the effects of field redefinitions over those parameters .",
    "these effects in the fermion sector were discussed in detail in the context of extended qed @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that under the fermion field redefinition @xmath147 it is possible to generate a would - be lorentz - violating lagrangian in the free fermion context and @xmath0 represents the lorentz violation . here",
    "@xmath0 is a real symmetric coefficient of the lorentz violating @xmath148 term in the fermion sector .",
    "however , this transformed lagrangian can further be expressed in terms of a new coordinate system having a non - diagonal metric , i.e. a skewed coordinate system , and in this way it is possible to restore the form of the original lagrangian . in this framework",
    ", this shows that @xmath149 is not physical .",
    "the redundancy of @xmath0 , however , disappears when the fermion - photon interaction is involved .",
    "a very similar analysis for the scalar sector of a toy model , involving a conventional fermion sector with a scalar field @xmath150 , gives us @xmath151 $ ] , where the scalar field redefinition @xmath152 is assumed . again expressing the fields in terms of skewed coordinates with a modified metric @xmath153 the apparent lorentz - violating ( @xmath15)-term can be absorbed in the scalar sector but it reappears in the fermion sector as a @xmath154-term .",
    "if we further extend our model by including fermion - photon interactions one can show that there is a mixing among @xmath155 , and nine unbounded @xmath19 coefficients @xcite .",
    "consequently , the observability of @xmath15 is nothing but a matter of convention .",
    "the above analysis enables us to move a non - zero @xmath156 term into either a @xmath0 term or a @xmath22 term . in this letter",
    "we _ only _ concentrate on the lorentz and cpt violation in the scalar sector of the sme , hence we assume that the theory has a conventional fermion sector , which means that bounds on @xmath0 will lead to effective bounds on @xmath156 .",
    "a full and systematic analysis of all of the field redefinitions and redundancies in the sme would be valuable , but is beyond the scope of this paper . with our normalizations ,",
    "a bound on @xmath0 will translate directly into an equivalent bound on @xmath157 .",
    "we thus need the current bounds on the @xmath0 coefficients .",
    "although numerous bounds appear in the literature , many of them should be taken _",
    "cum grano salis_. consider the spatial parts of @xmath0 .",
    "the strongest bounds give an upper limit on the diagonal spatial elements of @xmath158 @xcite and on the off - diagonal elements @xmath159 and @xmath160 of @xmath161 @xcite , and @xmath162 of @xmath158 @xcite .",
    "there are several caveats , however .",
    "first , these are bounds for @xmath0 of the neutron .",
    "it is conceivable that the mechanism that results in lorentz violation is proportional to the charge , and these experiments would miss the effect .",
    "it is also conceivable that a version of schiff s theorem ( which shows that in the nonrelativistic limit , the electric dipole moment of an atom will vanish , even if it does not vanish for constituents ) will cause a screening of the @xmath0 coefficients of the quarks .",
    "the first effect can be eliminated by considering protons or electrons , the second can be eliminated by considering electrons .",
    "another caveat is that the bounds on the diagonal elements are actually bounds on @xmath163 and @xmath164 , and thus if the lorentz violation is isotropic , the bounds will not apply . in this case , the vanishing trace condition will ( as in the case of the double - traceless condition on @xmath22 ) yield , when the fermion field is properly normalized , a nonzero @xmath165 , and thus the bounds on the diagonal spatial elements will be that of the bound on @xmath165 .",
    "the bound on @xmath165 can be obtained by comparing antiproton cyclotron frequencies with those of a hydrogen ion @xcite and a very weak bound of @xmath166 is extracted .",
    "an interesting connection between the dispersion relation for fermions and the @xmath165 coefficient has been noted by bertolami , et al.@xcite , and astrophysical experiments to improve the bound is proposed .",
    "for the time - space components , there are various studies based on the sensitivities of some planned experiments @xcite ; most of the bounds are from the neutrino sector of the sme and the highest proposed sensitivity is around @xmath161 @xcite .",
    "the remaining part of the higgs sector lagrangian has one term that violates both lorentz and cpt symmetries , represented by the complex constant coefficient @xmath167",
    ". one interesting effect of this term is the modification of the conventional electroweak @xmath168 symmetry breaking .",
    "minimization of the static potential yields a nonzero expectation value for @xmath45 boson field of the form @xmath169 .",
    "here we have assumed all the other lorentz - violating coefficients zero . the nonzero expectation value for the @xmath1 will , when plugged into the conventional fermion - fermion-@xmath1 interaction , yield a @xmath170 term .",
    "alternatively , one can look at the one - loop effects on the photon propagator , however this will yield much weaker bounds . by assuming @xmath16 is the only lorentz - violating term in the higgs sector",
    ", one finds that the effective @xmath171 . if we look at the best current bounds on @xmath8 , from testing of cosmic spatial isotropy for polarized electrons @xcite , @xmath172 gev and @xmath173 gev in the sun - centered frame .",
    "the best bound comes from the neutron with the use of a two - species noble - gas maser @xcite and it is of the order of @xmath174 gev . note that in order to get this bound there are some assumption about the nuclear configurations , which make the bound uncertain accuracy to within one or two orders of magnitude .",
    "the bound on the time component of @xmath8 is around @xmath175 gev @xcite .",
    "therefore , the best bounds for the real part of @xmath176 are @xmath177 gev and @xmath158 gev for the @xmath178 and for the @xmath179 components , respectively .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath16 is unphysical , since this term in the lagrangian is a total divergence .",
    "in this work we have studied the bounds on the lorentz and/or cpt violating coefficients in the higgs sector of the sme .",
    "it is shown that all antisymmetric cpt - even lorentz - violating coefficients give second - order contributions to the photon vacuum polarization at one - loop . by comparing with the @xmath22-term and assuming one of them nonzero in each case ( without high - precision cancellation ) , we find @xmath180 .",
    "for the symmetric part of @xmath11 , after discussing the close connections with the lorentz - violating coefficients @xmath0 in the fermion sector by means of coordinate and field redefinitions , we conclude that the bounds could be determined directly from the @xmath0-term . in a very similar way we obtain",
    "the bound on the cpt and lorentz - violating coefficient @xmath176 by comparing with @xmath8-term in the fermion sector .",

    "recent developments in string theory indicate that lorentz - violating non - commutative geometry might be a low - energy probe of planck scale physics @xcite , and this geometry will be antisymmetric .",
    "it is interesting that our upper bounds on the coefficients are @xmath183 , which is less than an order of magnitude above the ratio of the electroweak to planck scale .",
    "an improvement in the birefringence bounds of a couple of orders of magnitude ( which is feasible @xcite ) could probe this sensitivity .",
    "should a @xmath22 term actually be discovered , our analysis shows how one can distinguish higgs sector lorentz violation from other sectors .",
    "specifically , of the ten observable @xmath22 coefficients , we find nonzero values only for the two independent diagonal elements of @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the origin of lorentz violation might be experimentally accessible .",
    "it should be noted that inclusion of gravity might lead to new lorentz - violating terms , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    if the primary effects of an underlying lorentz and cpt violation appear in the higgs sector , what are the most promising experiments ?",
    "we have seen that cpt violation will be manifested through a vacuum expectation value of the @xmath1 boson , and the `` @xmath184 '' coefficient for a fermion will be proportional to the weak axial coupling of that fermion . testing this",
    "would require @xmath185 to be measured for at least two fermions . for antisymmetric cpt - even lorentz violation",
    ", there are very specific signatures , discussed in the previous paragraph , and improvement in the birefringence bounds of a couple of orders of magnitude would be valuable . for symmetric cpt - even lorentz violation , there are tight bounds , but with various assumptions and caveats .",
    "the relatively weak @xmath165 and @xmath186 bounds , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , could be substantially tightened .",
    "we are extremely grateful to alan kosteleck for many useful discussions , much advice and encouragement .",
    "we also thank chris carone for useful discussions .",
