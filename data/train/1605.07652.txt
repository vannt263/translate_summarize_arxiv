    "decomposing @xmath31 into its hermitian and anti - hermitian parts , we write @xmath32 , with @xmath33 here @xmath34 and @xmath35 are @xmath36 and @xmath37 dimensional hermitian matrices , respectively , @xmath38 is an @xmath39 dimensional rectangular matrix , and @xmath40 is a diagonal matrix with entries @xmath41 .",
    "physically , the matrices @xmath34 and @xmath35 describe dynamics due to sublattice potentials and hopping within the decaying and non - decaying subspaces , respectively . similarly , the matrix @xmath38 describes the hopping between decaying and non - decaying sites . in the topological classification scheme that follows",
    ", we will say that two systems are in the same phase if and only if their corresponding families of bloch hamiltonians @xmath30 and @xmath42 can be continuously deformed into one another without encountering a dark eigenstate for any @xmath6 .",
    "before embarking on a detailed analysis , we first investigate the general constraints imposed by the geometry of the bloch hamiltonian space . from these considerations",
    "we deduce that the classification problem is trivial when there is more than one decaying site per unit cell ( @xmath10 ) : if no additional constraints are imposed , all hamiltonians with @xmath10 belong to the same phase .",
    "consider an @xmath4-band system with @xmath43 decaying sites per unit cell . in this case , the @xmath5 bloch hamiltonian @xmath31 is specified by @xmath44 real parameters , for each @xmath6 : @xmath45 parameters define the @xmath5 hermitian part , @xmath46 , and @xmath0 parameters @xmath47 specify the decaying part , @xmath48 .",
    "because the decay rates @xmath26 must be strictly positive , the set of bloch hamiltonians can be identified with @xmath49 .",
    "the geometry of the problem becomes more interesting when we add the requirement that a particle initialized in _ any state _ must escape from the system with certainty in the infinite - time limit , i.e. ,  that @xmath31 must not support a dark state for any @xmath6 . a necessary and sufficient condition for a hamiltonian @xmath31 to have a dark state is that it has an eigenvector @xmath50 which vanishes on the entire decaying subspace : @xmath51 , in the representation introduced in eq .. in terms of the parametrization in eq .",
    ", such an eigenvector exists if and only if @xmath52 is an eigenvector of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath31 has a dark state if and only if @xmath35 has an eigenvector @xmath55 satisfying @xmath54 .",
    "while it is not easy to visualize the subset of hamiltonians with dark states , here we will focus on its crudest features  in particular , its dimension .",
    "we note that the matrix relation @xmath54 stands for @xmath0 independent equations . satisfying all @xmath0 equations",
    "simultaneously imposes @xmath13 real constraints on @xmath31 , since both the real and imaginary parts in each entry of @xmath56 must vanish separately .",
    "it then follows that the subset of dark state hamiltonians has codimension [ eq : codimension ] d = 2 m .",
    "this dimension counting is important because it gives strong constraints on when the hamiltonians @xmath30 can support a nontrivial classification .",
    "each family of hamiltonians @xmath30 corresponds to a closed loop in the bloch hamiltonian space .",
    "two hamiltonians @xmath57 are equivalent if and only if the two corresponding loops can be deformed into one another without passing through the dark state subset .",
    "when the dark state subset has codimension greater than @xmath58 , there is enough freedom that any loop can always be deformed around it , and contracted down to a point without obstruction . as an analogy , consider a loop in @xmath59 winding around a codimension @xmath60 subset , such as a single point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) .",
    "we conclude that the classification problem must be trivial when there is more than one decaying site per unit cell .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath7 , the subset of dark state hamiltonians has codimension equal to @xmath58 , and there can be topologically distinct ways for loops to `` wind '' around the dark state subset . here , the analogy to think about is the winding of a loop in @xmath59 around a codimension @xmath58 subset , such as the @xmath55-axis ( see fig .  [",
    "loops with different windings can not be continuously connected to one another without passing through the dark state subset and therefore correspond to distinct phases .",
    "according to the preceding arguments , the only models which permit a nontrivial classification are those with 1 decaying site per unit cell ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we now explicitly identify all the possible phases for these systems , and construct a topological invariant which distinguishes them .",
    "the first step is to find a way to parametrize the set @xmath62 of @xmath5 bloch hamiltonians @xmath63 without dark states . here , for the case",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath34 is a scalar and @xmath38 is an @xmath64 dimensional column vector . to this end , let @xmath65 be any such matrix .",
    "it follows from the lack of dark states that ( a ) each eigenvector @xmath66 of @xmath35 ( for @xmath67 ) satisfies @xmath68 , and ( b ) the eigenvalues @xmath69 of @xmath70 are non - degenerate .",
    "the first implication is clear ; as for the second , note that if any eigenvalue were degenerate , then by taking a suitable linear combination of eigenvectors one could construct a new eigenvector with @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath71 be the @xmath72 unitary matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors @xmath66 , arranged in order of increasing eigenvalue , and with the phases of @xmath66 fixed by the condition that @xmath73 is real and positive .",
    "then we have ( suppressing @xmath6 indices ) @xmath74 where @xmath75 is real and positive , and @xmath76 is diagonal with entries @xmath77 . any @xmath65 without dark states",
    "can be written uniquely in this way ; conversely , it is clear that any matrix of this form is a valid @xmath65 without dark states .",
    "hence , the set @xmath62 of @xmath5 matrices without dark states can be parametrized in terms of ( a ) an @xmath72 unitary matrix @xmath71 , ( b ) a vector @xmath75 with real , positive entries , ( c ) a diagonal matrix @xmath76 with real entries @xmath78 , and ( d ) a complex scalar @xmath79 .",
    "it is now simple to find all the different phases for the @xmath5 system : each hamiltonian @xmath31 corresponds to a closed loop in the space @xmath62 , so the problem of classifying different phases is equivalent to finding all topologically distinct closed loops in @xmath62 .",
    "let us parametrize @xmath31 by @xmath80 .",
    "it is not hard to see that any closed loop @xmath81 in the space @xmath82 can be deformed into any other without obstruction , and similarly for @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "hence , the only component which could have any nontrivial topology is @xmath85 . as for this case",
    ", it is known that closed loops @xmath85 in the space @xmath86 are classified by their winding number @xmath9 , defined by @xmath87 putting this all together , we conclude that the winding number @xmath9 gives a complete classification of the different possible phases of our system : two systems described by bloch hamiltonians @xmath30 and @xmath42 are in the same phase if and only if they have the same winding number , as defined by eq ..    note that the existence of a bloch hamiltonian , parametrized by a well - defined crystal momentum @xmath6 , depends crucially on translational symmetry . indeed , in the general case ( see below for an exception where the topology is protected by an additional symmetry ) ,",
    "the sharp distinction between phases breaks down when translation symmetry is broken .",
    "one way to see this is by imagining a periodic perturbation which doubles the unit cell .",
    "because the new unit cell contains more than one decaying site ( @xmath10 ) , the classification becomes trivial : all hamiltonians can be smoothly connected without encountering a dark state .",
    "alternatively , one may note that random on - site potentials disrupt the destructive interference that is responsible for the dark state .",
    "importantly , for many physical situations described by a model of the form above ( see e.g. , refs .  ) , the effective single particle hopping problem actually describes evolution between states in a many - body hilbert space , rather than in real space . in such contexts , disorder in the unit cell index",
    "may not be a natural perturbation .    finally , to connect to familiar quantities , we note that the winding number in eq .",
    "is proportional to the sum of zak phases over _ all _ @xmath4 bands of @xmath46 : w = -_n=1^n _ n , _",
    "n = k , n i_k k , n , with @xmath88 . here",
    "the phases of the eigenvectors @xmath89 are chosen such that the component corresponding to the decaying sublattice is real and positive . while the zak phase @xmath90 for any individual band @xmath91 is generally not quantized@xcite , the sum of zak phases over _ all bands _ must be an integer multiple of @xmath28 .",
    "the winding number , given by this integer , does not play a role in standard discussions of zak phases because in the usual case the zak phase is only meaningful mod @xmath28 , and different integer values of @xmath9 can not be distinguished .",
    "in contrast , in our problem the identification of the decaying subspace and the choice of unit cell uniquely fix a gauge , giving a physically distinct meaning to all integer values of @xmath9 that is reflected in observables such as the displacements investigated in ref .",
    ", see also sec .  [",
    "sec : conseq ] .",
    "as the dimension counting argument above demonstrates , imposing a `` no dark states '' requirement on non - hermitian systems of the form described by eqs . and allows for a classification into distinct topological phases .",
    "the inequivalence of different phases arises because of the restrictions imposed by the no dark states requirement on the space of allowed bloch hamiltonians .",
    "if further restrictions or symmetries are introduced , additional topological phases , corresponding to new classes of non - contractible loops in the bloch hamiltonian space , may be generated . in principle , a wide variety of such additional symmetries could be introduced . here",
    "we give two examples for demonstration , and leave a further exploration of the role of various symmetries to future work .    in the first case we consider a `` weak bipartite '' constraint , which prohibits non - vanishing hopping matrix elements between two decaying sites or two non - decaying sites in different unit cells . on the other hand",
    ", it allows for on - site energies and hopping between non - decaying sites _ within the same unit cell _  @xcite . in this sense , this condition is weaker than a conventional bipartite constraint .",
    "note that any nearest - neighbor hopping model will satisfy this constraint . for the tight binding hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "the weak bipartite constraint reads : [ eq : weak_bipartite ] t^_m-m = 0 , , m , > m ;  m m ,    to obtain a classification in this case , we proceed similarly to above .",
    "first , we note that the weak bipartite constraint implies that the @xmath92 matrix @xmath93 in eq",
    ". does not depend on @xmath6 . as a result , the family of @xmath94 unitary matrices @xmath85 in the parametrization of eq .",
    "can be decomposed in terms of a constant ( @xmath6-independent ) unitary matrix @xmath95 and a family of diagonal unitary matrices @xmath96 : @xmath97 . here",
    "@xmath95 is used to diagonalize @xmath70 , while @xmath98 adjusts the phases of the eigenvectors to ensure that @xmath81 in eq .",
    "is real and positive for each @xmath6 . given that @xmath85 is of this special form , we can define @xmath99 different winding numbers ",
    "one winding number for each of the diagonal entries of @xmath98 .",
    "each winding number describes how the corresponding element of @xmath98 winds around the origin as a function of @xmath6  @xcite . if the bipartite constraint is lifted , the single invariant ( [ winding ] ) that remains is the winding of the determinant of @xmath98  i.e. the _ sum _ of these @xmath99 winding numbers .",
    "thus we see that the additional restriction imposed by the weak bipartite constraint opens a richer topological structure in the system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "next we consider systems satisfying a `` strong bipartite '' constraint .",
    "this constraint prohibits hopping matrix elements between two decaying or two non - decaying sites , _ whether or not they belong to the same unit cell_. on - site energy terms ( any one of which can be regarded as a matrix element between a site and itself ) are also prohibited .",
    "in addition , for a system with @xmath22 sites per unit cell , we require that exactly @xmath0 sites are decaying , and @xmath0 sites are non - decaying .",
    "this means that the systems we now consider will in general have more than one decaying site per unit cell . in terms of the tight binding model defined in eq .",
    ", the strong bipartite constraint reads superficially identically to eq .",
    ", [ eq : strong_bipartite ] t^_m-m=0 , , m , > m , however with the values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 unconstrained , being allowed to be _ either equal or unequal . _    according to the dimension counting argument , if no constraints were added , we would not expect to find more than one phase for @xmath100 since then there is more than one decaying site per unit cell .",
    "however , the strong bipartite constraint severely restricts the set of allowed hamiltonians , leading to a non - trivial topological classification for the case with equal numbers of decaying and non - decaying sites ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]d ) .",
    "in fact , the strong bipartite condition implies that the hermitian part of the bloch hamiltonian , @xmath46 , possesses a `` chiral '' symmetry defined by an operator @xmath101 that anticommutes with @xmath46 . in a representation",
    "where the amplitudes on decaying sites ( @xmath102 ) are listed first , followed by the amplitudes on non - decaying sites ( @xmath103 ) , @xmath46 and @xmath101 are described by [ gamma ] h_0(k ) = (    cc 0 & h_ab(k ) + h_ba(k ) & 0    ) , s = (    cc & 0 + 0 & -    ) , here @xmath104 describes the bipartite hopping and @xmath105 stands for the @xmath36 identity matrix . from the theory of one dimensional topological insulators , it is known that a chiral symmetry of the form ( [ gamma ] ) leads to the existence of an integer - valued topological classification@xcite .",
    "the value of the invariant is determined by the winding of @xmath106 as @xmath6 varies over the brillouin zone .",
    "importantly , in the case of the topological insulators , non - trivial topology arises from the requirement of maintaining a nonzero bandgap . here , a _ different physical principle _ ( the requirement of complete decay ) is responsible for the division into distinct topological classes .",
    "interestingly , in the special case of our non - hermitian problem with the strong bipartite constraint , the nonzero bandgap and no - dark - state conditions coincide : both conditions are equivalent to the mathematical requirement that @xmath107 .",
    "thus in this particular case the non - hermitian problem follows the same classification as a one - dimensional topological insulator , albeit for a different physical reason .",
    "several important physical consequences can be inferred from this relationship between the topological insulators and the strong bipartite case .",
    "first , given that the classification of insulators with chiral symmetry persists even without translational symmetry , the same robustness must hold for the non - hermitian problem .",
    "alternatively , one can establish this fact by directly generalizing the winding number ( [ winding ] ) to disordered systems .",
    "such a generalization can be obtained by considering a finite ring - like geometry and then analyzing the dependence of the hamiltonian on the phase of a twisted - periodic boundary condition .",
    "another implication of this analogy is that phases with nonzero winding number must support `` dark edge modes '' localized near the ends of the system , when defined in a finite geometry with a boundary . to see this , recall that topological insulators with chiral symmetry feature robust localized edge modes with exactly zero energy .",
    "such states can be defined to live on only one sublattice or the other . due to the boundary conditions at the edges ,",
    "the zero - mode localized near one end will have its support on one of the two sublattices , while the zero - mode at the other end will have its support on the opposite sublattice .",
    "for the edge which features a zero - mode with support entirely on the non - decaying ( @xmath103 ) sublattice , we obtain dark edge states for the corresponding non - hermitian problem .",
    "the zero - mode localized at the other edge has its support on the decaying ( @xmath102 ) sublattice and does not exhibit an enhanced lifetime .",
    "we note , however , that these `` dark edge modes '' are only truly dark for an infinite system .",
    "for a system of finite length , hybridization between edge states at opposite ends of the chain , which live on opposite sublattices , endows the dark edge mode with a small decay rate that decreases exponentially in the system size .",
    "interestingly , such nearly dark states were observed in the experiment of ref .  , and in numerical investigations of a related in system in ref .  .",
    "in the latter , a model of nuclear spin pumping in spin - blockaded quantum dots was mapped onto a non - hermitian nearest - neighbor hopping problem of the form ( [ se ] ) , restricted to a finite length chain .",
    "the model satisfied the strong bipartite constraint but lacked translational symmetry : intracell hopping was considered uniform , occurring with an amplitude @xmath108 , while intercell hopping amplitudes @xmath109 varied smoothly from nearly zero at the edges of the chain to a maximal value @xmath110 near the center . for @xmath111 , the entire chain was in the trivial phase with winding @xmath112 . here nothing noteworthy was observed . for @xmath113 , however , the central region of the chain entered the topological phase with @xmath114 , while the outer regions remained trivial with @xmath112 .",
    "thus two topological phase boundaries were formed .",
    "as described above , in such a finite system we would expect to find an almost - dark state localized near one of the phase boundaries .",
    "indeed , the numerics showed that particles initialized near the rightmost phase boundary exhibited extremely long dwell times , characteristic of these nearly - dark states .",
    "the dark states thus provide a potentially important experimental signature of the spin - pumping physics described by that model .",
    "given the existence of the topological classification outlined above , it is natural to expect that some observable properties of the system can be related to the associated winding number .",
    "such behavior was evident in ref .  , where the average displacement of a particle initialized on one of the non - decaying sites in the @xmath115 case ( two sites per unit cell ) with nearest - neighbor hopping was found to be quantized , with its value equal to the value of the topological index .",
    "more generally , consider any observable which can be written as an integral over the entire dwell time of a particle in the system , [ obs ] x = _ 0^ dt .",
    "one may consider the observable for a particular initial state , or averaged over some distribution of initial states .",
    "such `` time - integrated observables '' have proven useful more generally in the study of dynamical phase transitions@xcite .    when do we expect eq . to display non - analytic behavior ?",
    "for illustration , consider an initial state where the particle is localized on one of the non - decaying sites . at a transition point where @xmath116 supports a dark state for some @xmath6 ,",
    "the average lifetime diverges due to the overlap of the initial state with the dark state : @xmath117 , see ref .  .",
    "although for an infinite system the dark state itself has only infinitesimal occupation in the initial state , the contributions of nearby states with extremely long lifetimes give rise to a divergence via a van hove - like singularity . in such cases ,",
    "the integral over time in eq . may not converge , giving rise to non - analytic behavior of @xmath118 at the transition .",
    "similar considerations apply for uniform sampling over all possible initial states .    in the classification arguments above we showed that , when there is exactly one decaying site per unit cell ( @xmath7 ) , two hamiltonians in different phases can not be smoothly connected without crossing a dark state . therefore",
    ", we generically expect non - analytic behavior at the corresponding topological transitions",
    ". note that a path connecting two hamiltonians in the _ same phase _ may also exhibit accidental crossings with the dark state manifold , thus giving rise to non - analytic behavior without a net topological phase change .",
    "this behavior is analogous to that at a classical first order phase transition line which terminates at a critical point , as in the case of the liquid - vapor transition . for cases with @xmath10 and no additional symmetries , where the codimension of the set of dark - state supporting hamiltonians is greater than 2",
    ", we generically do not expect non - analyticities to be encountered without fine tuning . as a consequence",
    ", the breaking of translational symmetry , which can be viewed as an expansion of the unit cell , is expected to smooth out singularities in observables ( see e.g.  refs .  ) .      in the subsection above we argued that , quite generally , one may expect non - analytic behavior of time - integrated observables as parameters are tuned through topological transition points .",
    "we now illustrate this behavior for the specific example of the average displacement achieved by a particle before decay , for @xmath119 sites per unit cell .",
    "in particular we will consider the situation where the displacement is averaged over a uniform distribution of all possible initial states .",
    "here we find that the averaged observable in fact contains a term which is directly given by the winding number itself , changing in quantized - height jumps across the transitions .     as a first step , note that displacement is equal to the integral of velocity over time .",
    "for a uniform distribution of initial states , the averaged displacement achieved over the particle s entire lifetime then takes the form of a time - integrated observable , eq . :",
    "[ eq : displacement ] m = _ 0^ dt [ _ k h_0(k , t ) ] , where @xmath120 is the velocity operator in the ( non - hermitian ) heisenberg picture . here",
    "the choice of a fully random initial state is reflected in the uniform integral over @xmath6 and the trace over all @xmath4 bands .     establishing a general relation between @xmath121 and the winding number @xmath9 in eq .",
    "for @xmath100 requires rather complicated additional technical machinery , and is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "however , with the weak bipartite constraint discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : symm ] , a direct , exact solution is possible ( see appendix ) . here",
    "we find that the expected displacement @xmath121 , averaged with equal weights over all initial states , consists of a quantized piece given by the winding number @xmath9 , on top of a non - universal background [ see eq . ] : m = + ( ) . thus we see that topological transitions are reflected in the averaged displacement as quantized jumps of height @xmath122 each time the winding number changes by 1 .",
    "in this work we have introduced a large class of one - dimensional non - hermitian systems which exhibit novel topologically protected transport phenomena . we developed a topological classification scheme for systems with periodically - placed absorbing sites , in which dark states whose wavefunctions vanish on the absorbing sites play a central role .",
    "topology is captured by suitably defined winding numbers of the systems non - hermitian bloch hamiltonians around the dark state manifolds .",
    "our results provide a framework for understanding the recent theoretical and experimental findings of topological phenomena in dissipative systems of this type .",
    "they also provide guidance in the search for new topological phenomena in other dissipative systems .",
    "the physical principle responsible for the classification is inherently linked to the presence of dissipation , through the requirement that any particle introduced to the system must escape in a finite time .",
    "it therefore has no analogue in conservative systems .",
    "we find that non - trivial topological classes are possible even when there no are symmetries apart from the translation symmetry of the lattice , provided that there is precisely one absorbing site per unit cell .",
    "this stands in contrast to the situation for conventional topological bands in one - dimensional insulators@xcite , where particular discrete unitary and/or anti - unitary symmetries are needed to obtain topologically distinct phases .",
    "the models that we have analyzed are fundamentally defined on _ discrete _ lattices .",
    "it is interesting to consider the consequences for _ continuous _ systems , such as the wave guide array used in the experiment of ref .  ,",
    "where the description in terms of a tight binding lattice is only approximate . roughly speaking",
    ", a continuous system may be thought of in terms of the @xmath123 limit for a family of discrete lattices with @xmath0 decaying sites per unit cell containing @xmath4 sites in total , with the ratio @xmath124 held fixed . based on the dimension",
    "counting argument developed in sec .",
    "[ sec : dimcount ] , which indicates that non - trivial topology emerges only when @xmath7 , we anticipate that truly distinct topological phases may only emerge in a continuous system if decay occurs through an array of point - like sinks or `` single - channel '' absorbers .",
    "the behavior of such a continuum system , with the absorbers described by @xmath0 periodic arrays of delta functions in the system hamiltonian , will be quite different for @xmath61 and @xmath125 .",
    "classification for such a problem can be obtained by a direct extension of the above results , giving nontrivial classes for systems with @xmath61 and no nontrivial classes for generic systems with @xmath125 absorbers per lattice unit cell .",
    "similar to the above discussion , systems with @xmath125 can exhibit nontrivial classes in the presence of additional symmetry constraints .",
    "however , a full understanding of the continuum non - hermitian problem is currently lacking . the continuum regime thus remains an open and interesting topic for further study .",
    "it is also natural to ask whether similar considerations can lead to a topological classification in higher dimensional systems .",
