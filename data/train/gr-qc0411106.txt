    "the non - trivial vacuum structure of su(2 ) yang - mills - higgs ( ymh ) theory allows for the existence of regular non - perturbative finite energy solutions , such as monopoles , multimonopoles and monopole - antimonopole systems .",
    "while spherically symmetric monopoles carry unit topological charge @xcite , monopoles with charge @xmath7 are axially symmetric @xcite or possess no rotational symmetry at all @xcite .    in the bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) limit of vanishing higgs potential , the monopole and",
    "multimonopole solutions satisfy a set of first order equations , the bogomolnyi equations @xcite . the spherically symmetric and axially symmetric bps ( multi)monopole solutions are known analytically @xcite . in these solutions",
    "all nodes of the higgs field are superimposed at a single point . in bps",
    "multimonopole solutions with only discrete symmetries , recently constructed numerically , the nodes of the higgs field can be located at several isolated points @xcite .",
    "the energy of bps solutions satisfies exactly the lower energy bound given by the topological charge .",
    "in particular , in the bps limit the repulsive and attractive forces between monopoles exactly compensate , thus bps monopoles experience no net interaction @xcite .",
    "the configuration space of ymh theory consists of topological sectors characterized by the topological charge of the higgs field .",
    "as shown by taubes @xcite , each topological sector contains besides the ( multi)monopole solutions further regular , finite energy solutions , which do not satisfy the first order bogomolnyi equations , but only the set of second order field equations .",
    "these solutions form saddlepoints of the energy functional @xcite . the simplest such solution , the monopole ",
    "antimonopole pair solution @xcite , is topologically trivial .",
    "it possesses axial symmetry , and the two nodes of its higgs field are located symmetrically on the positive and negative @xmath8-axis .",
    "recently we have constructed axially symmetric saddlepoint solutions , where the higgs field vanishes at @xmath9 isolated points on the symmetry axis .",
    "these represent chains of single monopoles and antimonopoles located on the symmetry axis in alternating order @xcite . for an equal number of monopoles and antimonopoles ,",
    "i.e.  for even @xmath1 , the chains reside in the topologically trivial sector .",
    "when the number of monopoles exceeds the number of antimonopoles by one , i.e.  for odd @xmath1 , the chains reside in the sector with topological charge one . while such chains can also be formed from doubly charged monopoles and antimonopoles ( @xmath4 ) , chains with higher charged monopoles ( @xmath10 )",
    "can not be formed .",
    "instead completely different solutions appear , where the higgs field vanishes on one or more rings centered around the symmetry axis @xcite .",
    "we therefore refer to these solutions as vortex rings .",
    "when gravity is coupled to ymh theory , this has significant effect on the monopole , multimonopole and monopole - antimonopole pair solutions .",
    "when the coupling constant is increased from zero @xcite , a branch of gravitating monopole solutions emerges smoothly from the flat space t hooft - polyakov monopole solution .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath11 , entering the einstein - yang - mills - higgs ( eymh ) equations , is proportional to the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath12 and the square root of the gravitational constant @xmath13 and to the square of the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath12 .",
    "with increasing coupling constant @xmath11 the mass of the gravitating monopole solutions decreases .",
    "the branch of gravitating monopole solutions extends up to a maximal value @xmath14 , beyond which gravity becomes too strong for regular monopole solutions to persist @xcite . for vanishing higgs self - coupling constant ,",
    "this first gravitating monopole branch merges with a second branch at @xmath14 , which extends slightly backwards , until at a critical value @xmath15 of the coupling constant a degenerate horizon develops @xcite .",
    "the exterior space time of the solution then corresponds to the one of an extremal reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black hole with unit magnetic charge @xcite . at @xmath15 this second branch of gravitating monopole solutions",
    "thus bifurcates with the branch of extremal reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) solutions .",
    "remarkably , the additional attraction in the ymh system due to the coupling to gravity also allows for bound monopoles , not present in flat space @xcite .    for the monopole - antimonopole pair solution ,",
    "on the other hand , we observe a different coupling constant dependence for the gravitating solutions @xcite . again",
    "a branch of gravitating monopole - antimonopole pair solutions emerges smoothly from the flat space solution , and merges at a maximal value of the coupling constant @xmath14 with a second branch of gravitating monopole - antimonopole pair solutions .",
    "this second branch , however , extends all the way back to vanishing coupling constant . along the first branch",
    "the mass of the solutions decreases with increasing @xmath11 , since with increasing gravitational strength the attraction in the system increases . along the second branch",
    "the mass increases strongly with decreasing coupling constant and diverges in the limit of vanishing coupling constant .",
    "this upper branch may be considered as being obtained by decreasing the higgs expectation value . along the upper branch",
    "the solutions shrink to zero size in the limit @xmath16 . scaling the coordinates , the mass and the higgs field by @xmath11 shows , that the scaled solutions approach the lowest mass bartnik - mckinnon ( bm ) solution @xcite of einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory in the limit @xmath16 .    here",
    "we consider the effect of gravity on the monopole - antimonopole chains and vortex rings @xcite .",
    "characterizing these solutions by the integers @xmath1 and @xmath2 , related to the polar angle @xmath17 and the azimuthal angle @xmath18 , respectively , we first consider chains , where @xmath19 , and then vortex rings , where @xmath20 .",
    "when @xmath1 is even , these solutions reside in the topologically trivial sector , thus we expect a similar dependence on the coupling constant as for the monopole - antimonopole pair . when @xmath1 is odd ,",
    "the solutions reside in the sector with charge @xmath2 , where the corresponding multimonopoles reside",
    ". therefore at first sight a connection with rn solutions appears to be possible , similar as observed for gravitating ( multi)monopoles .",
    "we find , however , that all these unstable gravitating solutions , chains and vortex rings alike , show the same general coupling constant dependence as observed for the monopole - antimonopole pair .",
    "two branches of solutions arise , a lower branch connected to the flat space solution and an upper branch connected to an eym solution . for @xmath21 these eym solutions",

    "the topological charge of these chains is either zero ( for even @xmath1 ) or unity ( for odd @xmath1 ) .",

    "the dependence of the @xmath60 solution , i.e.  of the t hooft - polyakov monopole , on gravity has been studied before .",
    "when gravity is coupled , a branch of gravitating monopoles emerges from the flat space solution and extends up to a maximal value @xmath14 , where it merges with a second branch .",

    "the @xmath59 chain , i.e.  the monopole - antimonopole pair , shows a different dependence on the coupling constant @xcite .",
    "again , when gravity is coupled , a branch of gravitating monopole - antimonopole pair solutions emerges from the flat space solution , and merges with a second branch of monopole - antimonopole pair solutions at a maximal value of the coupling constant @xmath14 .",
    "but since the monopole - antimonopole pair solutions reside in the topologically trivial sector and thus carry no magnetic charge , this upper branch of solutions can not bifurcate with a branch of extremal rn solutions at a critical value @xmath15 of the coupling constant .",

    "the mass of the solutions decreases with increasing @xmath11 , since with increasing gravitational strength the attraction in the system increases . along the second branch , in contrast , the mass increases strongly with decreasing @xmath11 , and the solutions shrink correspondingly . in the limit of vanishing coupling constant the mass then diverges and the solutions shrink to zero size .    scaling the coordinates and the higgs field ,",
    "however , via @xmath111 leads to a limiting solution with finite size and finite scaled mass @xmath112 @xcite , @xmath113 indeed , after the scaling the field equations do not depend on @xmath11 .",
    "instead @xmath11 appears in the asymptotic boundary conditions of the higgs field , @xmath114 .",
    "the higgs field then becomes trivial on the upper branch as @xmath16 .",
    "consequently , the scaled monopole - antimonopole solutions approach an eym solution as @xmath16 .",
    "this limiting solution is the lowest mass bm solution @xcite .",
    "the mass and the scaled mass of the monopole - antimonopole pair solutions are exhibited in fig .  1 .",
    "let us now consider chains with even @xmath1 , @xmath9 , which , like the @xmath59 monopole - antimonopole pair , also reside in the vacuum sector .",
    "as one may expect , these chains exhibit an analogous dependence on the coupling constant @xmath11 as the monopole - antimonopole pair . in the limit @xmath16 , a lower branch of gravitating solutions emerges from the flat space solution , and merges at a maximal value @xmath14 with an upper branch of solutions , which extends all the way back to @xmath16 .",
    "the mass of the chains with @xmath115 and @xmath116 is exhibited in fig .",
    "here , for @xmath16 , the emergence of the lower branches from the ymh limit is seen as well as the divergence along the upper branches . in fig .",
    "1b the scaled mass is exhibited . clearly , the scaled mass of these solutions approaches the mass of the lowest bm solution in the limit @xmath16 along the upper branch .",
    "the values of the metric functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 at the origin are shown in fig .  2 for both branches of the chains with @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "they evolve from unity in the flat space limit and reach the corresponding values of the lowest mass bm solution , when @xmath16 on the upper branch .",
    "let us now consider the nodes of the higgs field for these even @xmath1 chains . in fig .",
    "3a we recall the dependence of the single positive node of the monopole - antimonopole pair on the coupling constant .",
    "starting from the flat space limit , the location of the node continuously moves inwards along both branches , and reaches the origin in the @xmath16 limit on the upper branch .",
    "( we do not consider excited monopole - antimonopole pair solutions with several nodes here , which are related to excited bartnik - mckinnon solutions @xcite . )",
    "the flat space @xmath115 solution has two positive nodes .",
    "the evolution of these nodes along both branches is exhibited in fig .",
    "the location of the inner node again moves continuously inwards along both branches , and reaches the origin in the limit @xmath16 on the upper branch .",
    "in contrast , the location of the outer node reaches a finite limiting value in the limit @xmath16 on the upper branch , which , interestingly , agrees with the location of the single node of the flat space monopole - antimonopole pair solution .",
    "similarly , as seen in fig .  3c , of the 3 positive nodes of the @xmath116 solution the location of the innermost node reaches the origin in the limit @xmath16 on the upper branch , whereas the locations of the other two nodes reach finite limiting values , which agree with the locations of the two nodes of the flat space @xmath115 chain .    to obtain a better understanding of the limit @xmath16 on the upper branch for these chains ,",
    "let us consider the matter and metric functions for small values of the coupling constant . in fig .  4 ,",
    "for instance , we exhibit the gauge field function @xmath117 , the modulus of the higgs field @xmath118 and the metric function @xmath47 for the @xmath115 chain for a small value of the coupling constant , @xmath119 , on the upper branch .",
    "we observe , that we have to distinguish two regions for the matter function @xmath117 , an outer region and an inner region . in the outer region ,",
    "the gauge field function @xmath117 of the @xmath115 chain agrees well with the ( by 2 shifted ) corresponding gauge field function @xmath117 of the flat space ( @xmath59 ) monopole - antimonopole pair solution , while in the inner region the gauge field function @xmath117 of the @xmath115 chain agrees well with the corresponding function of the bm solution ( in by @xmath11 scaled coordinates ) .",
    "likewise , in the outer region the modulus of the higgs field @xmath118 of the @xmath115 chain agrees well with the modulus of the higgs field of the flat space ( @xmath59 ) monopole - antimonopole pair solution . in the bm solution , of course",
    ", no higgs field is present .",
    "( an analogous pattern holds for the functions @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 after a gauge transformation . ) the metric function @xmath47 , on the other hand , agrees well with the metric function of the bm solution ( in by @xmath11 scaled coordinates ) everywhere .",
    "( the same holds for the functions @xmath1 and @xmath48 . )",
    "the metric of the flat space ( @xmath59 ) monopole - antimonopole pair solution is , of course , trivial .",
    "thus , for small @xmath11 on the upper branch , the @xmath115 chain may be thought of as composed of a scaled bm solution in the inner region and a flat space ( @xmath59 ) monopole - antimonopole pair solution in the outer region .",
    "taking the limit @xmath16 then , the inner region shrinks to zero size , yielding a solution which is singular at the origin and which has infinite mass , while elsewhere it corresponds to the flat space ( @xmath59 ) monopole - antimonopole pair solution .",
    "this explains the above observation concerning the location of the higgs field nodes , made in fig .",
    "3 . on the other hand , taking the limit @xmath16 with scaled coordinates , the inner region covers all of space and contains the bm solution with its finite scaled mass , while the flat space ( @xmath59 ) monopole - antimonopole pair solution is shifted all the way out to infinity .    for the @xmath116 chain",
    ", we observe an analogous pattern for the functions in the limit @xmath16 on the upper branch , as exhibited in fig .  5 .",
    "in the outer region , the gauge field function @xmath117 of the @xmath116 chain agrees well with the ( by 2 shifted ) corresponding gauge field function @xmath117 of the flat space @xmath115 chain , while in the inner region it agrees well with the corresponding bm function ( in by @xmath11 scaled coordinates ) .",

    "turning now to monopole - antimonopole chains in the topological sector with unit charge , one might expect a completely different pattern for the coupling constant dependence of the solutions , namely a pattern which would be similar to the coupling constant dependence of the gravitating monopoles @xcite , where the upper branch of gravitating monopoles bifurcates with the branch of extremal rn solutions @xcite .",
    "such an expectation does not prove true , however .",
    "instead , the odd @xmath1 chains show a similar pattern as the even @xmath1 chains . two branches of gravitating @xmath1 chain solutions merge at a maximal value @xmath14 .",
    "the lower branch of solutions emerges from the flat space @xmath1 chain , and the upper branch extends all the way back to @xmath123 . for small values of @xmath11 on the upper branch , the solutions may be thought of as composed of a scaled bm solution in the inner region and a flat space @xmath124 solution in the outer region .    for the @xmath125 and @xmath126 chains , we exhibit the mass and scaled mass in fig .  1 , the values of the metric functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 at the origin in fig .  2 , and the location of the positive node(s ) , in fig .",
    "note , that in the limit @xmath16 on the upper branch , the location of the outer positive node of the @xmath126 chain agrees with the location of the positive node of the flat space @xmath125 chain .",
    "the composition of the solutions in terms of a scaled bm solution in the inner region and a flat space @xmath124 solution in the outer region is illustrated in fig .",
    "6 , where we exihibit the gauge field function @xmath117 for the @xmath125 and @xmath126 chains . for the @xmath125 chain",
    "clearly the gauge field function corresponds in the outer region to the function of a flat space ( @xmath60 ) monopole , while for the @xmath126 chain it corresponds to a flat space @xmath125 chain .",
    "concluding , we observe the same general pattern for all gravitating chain solutions with @xmath3 . from the flat space @xmath1 chain a lower branch of gravitating @xmath1 chains emerges , which merges at a maximal value @xmath14 with an upper branch .",
    "the value of @xmath14 decreases with increasing @xmath1 . for small @xmath11 the solutions on the upper branch",
    "may be thought of as composed of a scaled bm solution in the inner region and a flat space @xmath124 solution in the outer region .",

    "we illustrate this behaviour in fig .  7 for the @xmath115 chain with @xmath4",
    "clearly , the upper branch of the scaled mass approaches the mass of the generalized bm solution with @xmath4 , and the values of the metric functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 at the origin approach those of the generalized bm solution with @xmath4 as well .",
    "the composition of the solutions on the upper branch for small values of @xmath11 in terms of an inner generalized bm solution with @xmath4 and an outer flat space @xmath59 solution is exhibited in fig .",
    "8 for the gauge field function @xmath117 , the modulus of the higgs field @xmath42 and the metric function @xmath47 .      for larger values of @xmath2",
    "the flat space solutions completely change character , since the structure of the nodes of the higgs field in these solutions is totally different @xcite . whereas @xmath1 chains ( with @xmath19 ) possess only isolated nodes on the symmetry axis , for the solutions with @xmath20 the modulus of the higgs field vanishes on rings in the @xmath128-plane or in planes parallel to the @xmath128-plane , centered around the @xmath8 axis .",

    "this conjectured pattern is indeed observed for the @xmath59 and @xmath125 eymh solutions with @xmath129 . for @xmath129 and @xmath115 , however , a surprise in encountered . as illustrated in fig .  7 , on the upper branch the scaled mass of the @xmath129 and @xmath115 solutions does not approach the mass of the generalized bm solution with @xmath129 @xcite , but instead it approaches the mass of a new axially symmetric @xmath129 eym solution @xcite .",
    "moreover , a second new axially symmetric @xmath129 eym solution exists , which is slightly higher in mass @xcite .",
    "this second eym solution constitutes the endpoint of a second upper branch of @xmath129 and @xmath115 eymh solutions , which merges at a second maximal value of the coupling constant @xmath11 with a second lower branch , and it is along this second lower branch , that for small values of @xmath11 the solutions may be thought of as composed of a scaled generalized bm solution with @xmath129 in the inner region and a flat space @xmath59 solution in the outer region .",
    "thus for @xmath129 and @xmath115 there are four branches of solutions instead of two , and consequently there are four limiting solutions when @xmath16 .",
    "the masses of the generalized bm solutions and of the new eym solutions are exhibited in fig .",
    "note , that the boundary conditions of the new eym solutions differ from those of the generalized bm solutions at infinity @xcite .",
    "the eym solutions can thus be classified by these boundary conditions . denoting @xmath76 ,",
    "the new solutions have @xmath130 , whereas the generalized bm solutions have @xmath131 @xcite .    in fig .",
    "10 we illustrate the dependence of the location of the vortex of the higgs field on the coupling constant for these four branches of @xmath129 and @xmath115 solutions .",
    "the flat space solution has two vortex rings , located symmetrically in planes parallel to the @xmath128 plane .",
    "starting from the flat space location , the vortex rings move continuously inwards and towards the @xmath128 plane along the first lower branch and the first upper branch , until at a critical value of the coupling constant the two rings merge in the @xmath128 plane .",
    "when @xmath11 is decreased further along the first upper branch , a bifurcation takes place and two distinct rings appear in the @xmath128 plane . in the limit",
    "@xmath16 they shrink to zero size . in scaled coordinates , in contrast",
    ", they reach a finite limiting size . likewise , in scaled coordinates there are two distinct rings with finite size on the second upper branch ( located not too far from the two rings of the first upper branch ) . following the second upper branch and then the second lower branch",
    ", the inner ring shrinks to zero size in the limit @xmath16 ( in ordinary coordinates ) , while the outer ring approaches the location of the flat space vortex ring of the @xmath129 and @xmath59 solution .",
    "summarizing , we find the following pattern : from the flat space @xmath115 and @xmath129 vortex solution the first lower branch of gravitating vortex solutions emerges , which merges at the first maximal value @xmath14 with the first upper branch .",
    "along the first upper branch , for small values of @xmath11 the solutions approach the scaled @xmath130 and @xmath129 eym solution with lower mass .",
    "close to the first upper branch , for small values of @xmath11 the second upper branch arises from the scaled @xmath130 and @xmath129 eym solution with higher mass . this second upper branch merges at the second smaller maximal value @xmath14 with the second lower branch of solutions . along the second lower branch , for small values of @xmath11 the solutions",
    "may be thought of as composed of a scaled @xmath131 and @xmath129 eym solution in the inner region and a flat space @xmath59 and @xmath129 solution in the outer region .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "9 , no eym solutions with @xmath132 and @xmath129 appear .",
    "we therefore conjecture , that for solutions with @xmath5 and @xmath129 an analogous but generalized pattern holds .",
    "there are four branches of solutions . from the flat space @xmath5 and @xmath129 vortex solution",
    "the first lower branch emerges , and merges at a first maximal value @xmath14 with the first upper branch .",
    "along the first upper branch , the solutions approach a composite solution for small values of @xmath11 , consisting of the scaled @xmath130 and @xmath129 eym solution with lower mass in the inner region and an @xmath133 and @xmath129 ymh solution in the outer region .",
    "the second upper branch arises from a composite solution consisting of the scaled @xmath130 and @xmath129 eym solution with higher mass in the inner region and an @xmath133 and @xmath129 ymh solution in the outer region .",
    "the second upper branch merges at a second maximal value @xmath14 with the second lower branch of solutions . along the second lower branch , for small values of @xmath11 the solutions",
    "may be thought of as composed of a scaled @xmath131 and @xmath129 eym solution in the inner region and a flat space @xmath124 and @xmath129 solution in the outer region .      for vortex solutions with @xmath134",
    "we expect an analogous pattern as for the @xmath129 vortex solutions .",
    "in particular , there should be four branches of solutions : a first lower branch emerging from the flat space solution , a first upper branch approaching a composite solution consisting of the lower scaled @xmath130 eym solution and a @xmath133 ymh solution , a second upper branch arising from a composite solution consisting of the higher scaled @xmath130 eym solution and a @xmath133 ymh solution , and a second lower branch approaching a composite solution consisting of the scaled @xmath131 eym solution and a @xmath124 ymh solution .",
    "we illustrate this pattern for the @xmath126 and @xmath134 vortex solutions in fig .  11 , where we show the gauge field function @xmath117 for solutions on all four branches , for small values of @xmath11 .",
    "the scaled mass along the four branches is shown in fig .",
    "11c .    considering higher values of @xmath2",
    ", we observe in fig .",
    "9 , that for @xmath135 and @xmath136 at least five eym solutions exist : one @xmath131 , two @xmath130 and two @xmath137 solutions .",
    "this suggests , that for @xmath135 and @xmath116 six branches of gravitating vortex solutions exist : a first lower branch emerging from the @xmath135 flat space solution , a first upper branch approaching the lower mass scaled @xmath137 and @xmath135 eym solution , a second upper branch arising from the higher mass scaled @xmath137 and @xmath135 eym solution , a second lower branch approaching a composite solution consisting of the lower mass scaled @xmath130 and @xmath135 eym solution and a @xmath133 and @xmath135 ymh solution , a third upper branch arising from a composite solution consisting of the higher mass scaled @xmath130 and @xmath135 eym solution and a @xmath133 and @xmath135 ymh solution , and a third lower branch approaching a composite solution consisting of the scaled @xmath131 and @xmath135 eym solution and a @xmath124 and @xmath135 ymh solution .",
    "we indeed obtain these six branches numerically . surprisingly , there are two more branches for a small range of @xmath11 .",
    "we exhibit the scaled mass along these branches in fig .",
    "the value of the metric function @xmath48 at the origin is exhibited in fig .",
    "we have considered the effect of gravity on the monopole - antimonopole chains and vortex rings of yang - mills - higgs theory @xcite .",
    "the resulting solutions are regular , static , axially symmetric and asymptotically flat .",
    "they are characterized by two integers @xmath1 and @xmath2 . solutions with @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    "correspond to gravitating chains of @xmath1 monopoles and antimonopoles , each of charge @xmath138 , where the higgs field vanishes at @xmath1 isolated points along the symmetry axis .",
    "larger values of @xmath2 give rise to gravitating vortex solutions , where the higgs field vanishes on one or more rings , centered around the symmetry axis .",
    "concerning their dependence on the coupling constant @xmath11 , we observe the same general pattern for all gravitating chain solutions . from the flat space @xmath1 chain a lower branch of gravitating @xmath1 chains",
    "emerges , which merges at a maximal value @xmath14 with an upper branch . for small @xmath11 on the upper branch , the solutions may be thought of as composed of a scaled ( generalized ) bm solution in the inner region and a flat space @xmath124 solution in the outer region .",
    "consequently , the mass diverges in the limit @xmath16 , while the scaled mass approaches the mass of the lowest ( generalized ) bm solution of eym theory .",
    "the same pattern holds for gravitating vortex solutions with @xmath127 , and for @xmath139 when @xmath21 . for @xmath129 and @xmath22",
    ", however , a new phenomenon occurs . instead of two branches of solutions four branches of solutions arise .",
    "the reason for these is the presence of two additional eym solutions @xcite . in this case",
    "we find ( and conjecture for higher @xmath1 ) the following pattern for the coupling constant dependence : a first lower branch emerges from the flat space solution , a first upper branch approaches a composite solution consisting of the lower scaled @xmath130 eym solution and a @xmath133 ymh solution , a second upper branch arises from a composite solution consisting of the higher scaled @xmath130 eym solution and a @xmath133 ymh solution , a second lower branch approaches a composite solution consisting of the scaled @xmath131 eym solution and a @xmath124 ymh solution",
    ".    for @xmath140 and @xmath136 not only two but four additional eym solutions arise @xcite .",
    "we consequently find ( and conjecture for higher @xmath1 ) six branches of gravitating vortex solutions , and for a small range of @xmath11 even eight branches . for larger values of @xmath2",
    "we expect this trend to continue .",
    "we observe that for all the gravitating monopole - antimonpole pair solutions , chains of monopoles and antimonopoles and vortex rings we considered in this paper there is no formation of a degenerate horizon , in contrast to the gravitating monopole solution @xcite .",
    "we note that for gravitating skyrmions @xcite the dependence of the solutions on the gravitational coupling parameter follows the same pattern as for the monopole - antimonpole pair .",
    "again , two branches of solutions merge at the maximal value of the coupling parameter , and the upper branch is connected to the ( scaled ) lowest mass bm solution .    in this paper",
    "we have only considered gravitating chain and vortex solutions in the limit of vanishing higgs self - coupling . for finite values of the self - coupling constant",
    "the structure of the flat space solutions can become more involved , yielding solutions with vortex rings and several isolated nodes of the higgs field @xcite .",
    "their continuation to curved space remains to be studied .",
    "furthermore , it would be interesting to consider dyonic gravitating chain and vortex solutions @xcite , as well as black holes with monopole or dipole hair , consisting of chain - like or vortex - like structures @xcite . finally , recent work on gravitating monopoles and monopole - antimonopole pairs in the presence of a cosmological constant might be generalized to the study of gravitating chain and vortex solutions @xcite .            e.j .",
