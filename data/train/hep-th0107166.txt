    "four - dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric type ii orientifolds ( @xmath5@xcite and references therein ) provide a class of consistent open - string solutions which in turn could shed light on the physics of strongly coupled heterotic string models . from a more phenomenological viewpoint",
    ", they also provide a natural setup to localized gauge interactions in lower dimensional sub - manifolds of space - time , namely the d - branes , and lead to brane - world models .",
    "unfortunately , the constraints ( arising from ramond - ramond ( rr ) tadpole cancellation conditions ) on four - dimensional models are rather restrictive in the supersymmetric case , and lead to relatively unrealistic gauge sectors and matter contents in the simplest constructions .    among the several discrete or continuous deformations of the simplest models that have been explored , often mainly motivated by the search for standard model like theories",
    ", we may recall    * blowing - up of orientifold singularities @xcite : the resulting models are not described by a free world - sheet conformal field theory ( cft ) , hence the space - time spectrum can only be computed using field theory techniques . in compact setups ,",
    "the @xmath6 orientifold of @xcite is the only example in which this analysis has been performed @xcite ( it is interesting to point out that results in d - brane models differ in nature from those of perturbative heterotic orbifolds @xcite ) . *",
    "locating the branes at different point in the internal orbifold / orientifold space ( see for instance @xcite ) . in a t - dual picture",
    "these possibilities correspond to the turning of continuous or discrete wilson lines .",
    "explicit examples of wilson lines have been extensively considered , see for instance @xcite for discrete wilson lines , and @xcite for continuous ones . for partially successful attempts at supersymmetric",
    "model building using wilson lines see _ e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "* introduction of discrete values for the ( neveu - schwarz - neveu - schwarz ) ns - ns @xmath7 field @xcite",
    ". the novel feature of this discrete deformation is that the rank of the gauge group is reduced .",
    "this can also be understood in the t - dual picture as tilting the tori , thereby requiring fewer orientifold planes ( see appendix [ tadpoles ] ) and hence fewer d - branes . *",
    "introduction of gauge fluxes in the d - brane world - volumes ( see @xcite for an early discussion ) . in the supersymmetric context",
    "this has been explored in six - dimensional examples in @xcite . in a t - dual version ,",
    "models with gauge fluxes correspond to type ii orientifolds with d - branes intersecting at angles .",
    "supersymmetric models in six and four dimensions @xcite have been constructed in the situation with d6-branes parallel to the o6-planes in the model .",
    "such constructions however lead to non - chiral models .",
    "( in six dimensions , chiral supersymmetric models with d - branes not parallel with the o - planes have been obtained in @xcite , and implicitly in @xcite ) .",
    "recently it has been realized that the rr tadpoles cancellation conditions turn out to be much less constraining if one gives up the requirement of supersymmetry .",
    "this observation in @xcite was exploited in the context of type iib orientifold model building in _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "it has also allowed for a construction of type iia orientifold and orbifold models with d - branes at supersymmetry breaking angles and realistic theories , with the standard model gauge group ( or simple extensions thereof ) and three quark - lepton families @xcite ( for other proposals for realistic model - building using d - branes , without a specific string construction or in a non - compact set - up , see @xcite ) .    despite this remarkable success ,",
    "non - supersymmetric models have more complicated dynamics than supersymmetric ones , hence are less understood .",
    "in particular , tree level flat directions are generically lifted by quantum corrections , leading to involved stabilization problems . also , the models contain uncancelled ns - ns tadpoles which force to redefine the background geometry @xcite , as is obvious , for example , from the existence of non - zero cosmological constant in the models . for these and other reasons ,",
    "it is more reassuring to restrict to supersymmetric model building at the stringy level . however , even for such models , the eventual supersymmetry breaking required in any model attempting to describe realistic low - energy physics , will lead to these or analogous omnipresent issues , like the cosmological constant problem .",
    "the purpose of this paper is explore the construction of four - dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric type iia orientifolds with d6-branes intersecting at angles , and leading to chiral gauge sectors .",
    "the simplest models satisfying those requirements are orientifolds of toroidal type iia orbifolds @xmath8 or @xmath9 , with d6-branes not parallel to the o6-planes . in this paper",
    "we focus on the @xmath10 orbifold , for which the general pattern of the chiral spectrum is simple enough .",
    "extension to other orientifolds should be more involved , but otherwise straightforward",
    ".    we succeeded in constructing the first @xmath0 supersymmetric model with standard model gauge group and three quark - lepton families in this setup .",
    "supersymmetric d3-brane realistic model in section 4.3 in @xcite in a different context . ]",
    "( the letter version that summarizes the key results for this model appeared in @xcite . ) beyond the structure of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the model contains some additional gauge factors , right - handed neutrinos , a chiral set of fields with exotic standard model gauge quantum numbers , and diverse vector - like multiplets . despite its lack of fully realistic features",
    ", it provides the first construction of phenomenologically appealing supersymmetric compactifications in the setup of intersecting brane worlds .",
    "moreover , a particularly nice feature of such construction is that supersymmetry avoids the hierarchy problem generically present in the ( otherwise realistic ) models with d6-branes in @xcite .",
    "namely , our models will have a relatively large string scale ( close to the 4d planck scale ) and not very large internal dimensions ( @xmath11 at the largest ) .",
    "we also discuss a number of interesting general results involved in the construction .",
    "we describe the cancellation or previously unnoticed mixed @xmath12-gravitational anomalies , present in some orientifold models ( even without orbifold projection ) .",
    "they are canceled by a green - schwarz mechanism mediated by untwisted rr closed string fields , similar to that in @xcite for mixed non - abelian anomalies .",
    "the models under consideration , in a t - dual version , correspond to chiral supersymmetric versions of the @xmath13 type iib orientifold , with d9-branes with magnetic fluxes .",
    "we show that such models are related to the familiar non - chiral @xmath13 orientifold in @xcite by the t - dual of a four - dimensional version of the small instanton transitions @xcite .",
    "these transitions correspond , in the original picture , to recombinations of d6-branes wrapped on intersecting cycles .",
    "this provides a explicit picture of the transitions , which allows to reproduce interesting phenomena .",
    "in particular , we explicitly construct transitions where a toy model with standard model - like gauge group changes the number of generations , in a manner reminiscent of the chirality changing phase transitions in @xcite .    finally",
    ", the models upon consideration are supersymmetric only for specific choices of the untwisted ( complex structure ) moduli .",
    "namely , the condition to preserve supersymmetry @xcite is that the different d6-branes and o6-planes are related by rotations in @xmath14 .",
    "this implies certain constraints on the angles among objects , in the three complex planes in @xmath15 . for",
    "fixed wrapped three - cycles , they imply constraints on the untwisted complex structure moduli , so that supersymmetric solutions exist generically only at isolated points in moduli space .",
    "we briefly discuss the interesting question of the dominant supersymmetry breaking effects upon small departures from the supersymmetric points , and of supersymmetry restoration by vacuum restabilization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ rules ] we describe the construction of @xmath13 orientifolds with d6-branes at angles , and discuss their spectrum , independently of supersymmetry . in section [ cons ] we formulate the conditions to preserve 4d @xmath0 supersymmetry .",
    "we present several explicit examples , including a four - family standard model like theory , and a four - family @xmath16 grand unified theory ( gut ) model .",
    "the construction of three - family models turns out to be very constrained , but we succeed in building a model with sm gauge group ( times additional factors ) and three quark - lepton families ( plus additional exotic and vector - like matter ) .",
    "the requirement of three families demands introducing tilted complex structure in one two - torus , and supersymmetry requires choosing specific ratios for the radii in the remaining two - tori .    in section",
    "[ small ] we discuss how our chiral supersymmetric models are related to the familiar non - chiral @xmath13 orientifold @xcite . in a t - dual version",
    "they are connected through small instanton transitions . in the picture of branes at angles the transition corresponds to a recombination of 3-cycles",
    "on which the d6-branes wrap .",
    "such processes can mediate phase transitions changing the number of chiral families , as we illustrate in a toy construction with the standard model gauge group . in section [ ssb ]",
    "we briefly discuss the supersymmetry breaking effect in the open string sector when the ratios of radii in the two - tori are chosen slightly away from the supersymmetry - preserving values . these closed string moduli couple as fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) terms ,",
    "hence they generate d - term supersymmetry breaking terms whose magnitude is related to a deviation of the untwisted moduli away from their supersymmetric values . finally , in section [ gtwo ] we comment on more formal applications of our constructions , which provide examples whose lift to m - theory corresponds to compact 7-dimensional spaces admitting @xmath3 holonomy metrics , and leading to chiral four - dimensional gauge theories .",
    "section [ conc ] contains our final comments .",
    "in this section we provide the rules to construct consistent orientifolds , and to obtain the spectrum of massless states .",
    "we state these rules independently of supersymmetry , so they are valid for non - supersymmetric model building as well .",
    "our starting point is type iia theory on @xmath1 , with generators @xmath17 , @xmath18 associated to the twists @xmath19 and @xmath20 , hence acting as & : & ( z_1,z_2,z_3 ) ( -z_1,-z_2,z_3 ) + & : & ( z_1,z_2,z_3 ) ( z_1,-z_2,-z_3 ) where @xmath21 are complex coordinates in the @xmath15 . for simplicity , we consider the case of factorizable @xmath15 .",
    "we mod out this theory by the orientifold action @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is world - sheet parity , and @xmath24 acts by r : ( z_1,z_2,z_3 ) ( z_1,z_2,z_3 ) the model contains four kinds of o6-planes , associated to the actions of @xmath22 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , as shown in figure  [ orient ]",
    ". we will not be specially interested in the closed string sector , which can anyway be computed using standard techniques . for the case of rectangular two - tori , it is as in @xcite , by t - duality .    in order to cancel the corresponding rr crosscap tadpoles , we introduce d6-branes wrapped on three - cycles , which we consider factorized , namely obtained as the product of one - cycles in each of the three two - tori . specifically , we consider @xmath28 stacks of @xmath29 d6-branes , @xmath30 , wrapped on the @xmath31 cycle in the @xmath32 two - torus .",
    "we also need to include the images of these under the elements in the orientifold group .",
    "assuming for simplicity that our two - tori are rectangular ( extension to tilted two - tori is easy , and is discussed below ) , we include @xmath29 d6-branes with wrapping numbers @xmath33 .",
    "for branes on top of the o6-planes we also count branes and their images independently .    for future convenience , we define the homology class of the corresponding 3-cycles by = _",
    "i=1 ^ 3 ( n_a^i [ a_i ] + m_a^i [ b_i ] ) and analogously for @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "we also define the homology classes of the cycles wrapped by the o6-planes , which for rectangular tori read = [ a_1 ] & ; & [ _ r ] = - [ a_1 ] = - [ b_1 ] & ; & [ _ r ] = - [ b_1 ] [ defosix ] and we define @xmath35=[\\pi_{\\omega r } ] + [ \\pi_{\\omega r \\theta } ] + [ \\pi_{\\omega r\\omega}]+[\\pi_{\\omega r\\theta\\omega}]$ ] .",
    "concerning the orbifold projections , let us focus on the case where the branes pass through fixed points of the orbifold actions , hence @xmath17 and @xmath18 map each stack of branes to itself ( and with the same 3-cycle orientation ) .",
    "extension to other cases is simple , and briefly mentioned in section iiia . to specify the action of the different actions on the chan - paton indices of the branes , for each stack of d6@xmath36-branes , and",
    "their @xmath22 images , denoted d6@xmath37-branes , we introduce the chan - paton actions _ , a & = & ( i _ n_a/2,-i _ n_a/2 ; -i _ n_a/2,i _ n_a/2 ) +   + _ , a & = & +   + _ r , a & = & the actions for the orbifold group form a projective representation , which corresponds to the choice of closed string sector usually known as without discrete torsion .",
    "the models are constrained by rr tadpole cancellation conditions .",
    "orientifolds by @xmath22 action do not generate twisted crosscaps @xcite , hence the twisted disk tadpoles should vanish . the simplest way to accomplish",
    "this is to choose traceless chan - paton matrices , as done above .",

    "a n_a [ _ a ] + _ a n_a [ _ a ] + ( -4)8 [ _ o6 ] = 0 [ homosum ] it is further discussed in appendix a , and leads to the constraints ( [ tadpole1 ] ) .",

    "this can be avoided by removing the @xmath98 term in ( [ hyp1 ] ) , although this yields to exotic hyper - charges in the initial model . leaving these subtle points aside",
    ", we would like to emphasize that it is remarkable that one can describe quite explicitly these transition in relatively realistic models .",
    "we have succeeded in showing that small instanton transitions can mediate changes in the number of families in a model . moreover",
    ", the t - dual interpretation of these processes as recombination of cycles provides a useful tool in analyzing these transitions in the type ii orientifold setup .",
    "we believe these techniques can be useful in the study interesting phenomena in a simple geometric setup , and hence are complementary to other realizations of these transitions @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the general models we have considered are supersymmetric for specific choices of the untwisted moduli @xmath106 . in this section",
    "we briefly consider the main supersymmetry breaking effects on the open string sector as one moves away from the special supersymmetric values for @xmath106 .    on general grounds ,",
    "the complex structure moduli @xmath106 are expected to couple open string modes in our d6-branes on 3-cycles ( a - branes ) as fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) terms .",
    "this is mirror to the statement that khler moduli couple to b - branes as fi - terms , a familiar situation for d - branes at singularities @xcite .",
    "( note that related techniques have been employed in the blowing - up procedure of the type iib orientifold singularities @xcite ) .",
    "this has appeared in a related context in @xcite , and in situations where there are d - branes with ( @xmath107 or equivalently magnetic field ) fluxes in @xcite . following the latter ,",
    "we expect the corresponding fi - terms to be proportional to the deviation from the supersymmetric situation , in particular we expect the terms in the effective @xmath108 action _ a d^4x ( ^1_a + ^2_a + ^3_a ) d_a [ fi ] where @xmath109 is understood as a function of @xmath106 for fixed wrapping numbers @xmath31 . for instance , for square tori _ a^i = _ i. the fi - term vanishes for the supersymmetric situation @xmath110 , hence in general it is proportional to the deviation from this case .",
    "it is easy to see that this term reproduces the leading order splitting between scalar and fermion masses , as one would obtain from the string computation .",
    "namely , in @xmath55 sector , chiral fermions remain massless at tree level , while their scalar partners obtain a mass proportional to @xmath111 .    in supersymmetric models , the familiar arguments in @xcite",
    "relate the existence of green - schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism with the existence of fi terms , controlled by the partners of the fields mediating the gs interactions .",
    "their precise determination also requires knowledge about their khler potential , which should be easily determined for the untwisted complex structure moduli in our models .",
    "however , we skip the derivation of the fi terms , and briefly discuss the physics arising from eq.([fi ] ) .",
    "the turning of fi terms when untwisted moduli are shifted from the supersymmetric values actually does not automatically imply breaking of supersymmetry . as is familiar in heterotic constructions",
    ", some scalar fields may acquire vev s so as to make the d - term vanish .",
    "hence , supersymmetry would be restored in the shifted vacuum .",
    "an important difference with respect to heterotic models is that the fi - terms are not related to the dilaton , and can be tuned at will by tuning the untwisted moduli .",
    "the physics behind this process is that the original d6-brane configuration is no longer supersymmetric for the new choice of untwisted moduli ( since the angles are changed ) , so some intersecting d6-branes recombine into a smooth 3-cycle which is supersymmetric .",
    "this recombination is described by the vev acquired by certain scalar fields at intersections .",
    "it is an interesting question whether supersymmetry can always be restored in this fashion . despite the lack of a general argument",
    ", we strongly suspect that this is the case , at least in compact models .",
    "notice that however non - compact models allow for supersymmetry breaking by this fi - term mechanism ( see @xcite for discussion ) .    in order to provide a simple illustrative example ,",
    "let us consider the string - gut model in section [ gut ] , where there is only one relevant set of angles , namely those formed by the @xmath112 branes with the horizontal axes , denoted by @xmath61 henceforth .",
    "there are two relevant kinds of scalars , those arising at the intersections between the @xmath112 branes and their images , @xmath113 , and between the former and the @xmath114 branes , @xmath115 .",
    "the corresponding chiral multiplets carry opposite charges with respect to the single @xmath12 symmetry in the model , hence the d - term has the schematic structure d = 2 |_aa|^2 - |_ab|^2 + ( _ 1+_2+_3 ) hence , for deformations such that @xmath116 , the fields @xmath115 become tachyonic and acquire a vev , restoring supersymmetry .",
    "this corresponds to recombining the @xmath114 and the @xmath112 branes . for @xmath117",
    ", it is @xmath113 which acquire vev s to restore supersymmetry , triggering the recombination of the @xmath112 branes and their images",
    ".    it would be interesting to explore these processes in more detail , both in their effective field theory and in their geometric description .",
    "in this section we briefly outline a different ( more formal ) aspect of our models .",
    "recently there has been a lot of interest in the study of the dynamics of m - theory on 7-dimensional manifolds @xmath118 admitting a @xmath3 holonomy metrics @xcite .",
    "the interest stems from the fact that such compactifications lead to four - dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric field theories , with gauge interactions determined by the singularity structure of @xmath118 .",
    "moreover , such constructions have provided a geometric interpretation @xcite of the duality between type iia configurations with d6-branes on the special lagrangian 3-cycle in the deformed conifold , and type iia on the resolved conifold , without d6-branes but with rr 2-form fluxes @xcite .",
    "these results have been extended in diverse directions ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) , and suggest interesting connections with gauge theory dynamics and string duality .",
    "topological manifolds admitting a @xmath3 metric are not easy to characterize , as opposed to , _",
    "e.g. _ , spaces admitting a @xmath119 holonomy metric , which can be characterized by a topological condition ( the vanishing of the first chern class ) .",
    "the explicit construction of @xmath3 metrics is difficult , and has only been achieved in a few non - compact examples constructed in @xcite and the more recent generalizations in @xcite .",
    "( for applications to regular configurations of m - theory with @xmath0 supersymmery , see _ e.g. _ , @xcite and references therein . )",
    "however , string theory duality provides a simple strategy to obtain topological spaces which admit a @xmath3 metric , without constructing it explicitly .",
    "basically , any type iia configuration preserving @xmath108 @xmath0 supersymmetry , and including at most d6-branes and o6-planes , will lift to an m - theory compactification on a @xmath3 manifold ( see @xcite for nice discussions ) .",
    "the topological information can be used to obtain interesting qualitative features of these theories .    in this respect , the @xmath108 @xmath0",
    "supersymmetric type iia orientifolds with d6-branes and o6-planes at angles , studied in @xcite and in this paper , correspond to m - theory compactifications on @xmath3 manifolds . in configurations where the rr 7-form charges are locally cancelled ( namely , 2 d6-branes and 2 images on top of each o6-plane in the configuration ) , the m - theory lift is remarkably simple .",
    "the m - theory circle is constant over the base space @xmath120 , leading to a total variety @xmath121 , where the @xmath122 flips the coordinate parametrizing the m - theory circle , and acts on @xmath120 as an antiholomorphic involution ( hence changing the holomorphic 3-form to its conjugate ) .",
    "this is analogous to the discussion in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such models lead generically to non - chiral spectra , in the sense that even though one obtains chiral multiplets , they arise in real representations of the gauge group . on the other hand ,",
    "configurations with d6-branes away or not fully aligned with the o6-planes would led to more involved m - theory lifts .",
    "however , they are of great interest since , as shown in our general constructions , they lead to chiral gauge theories .    certainly , there exist simpler lines of attack to obtain chirality out of @xmath3 singular spaces . in particular , the simplest type iia supersymmetric configuration leading to chiral fermions is simply two intersecting d6-branes in flat space , related by an @xmath14 rotation .",
    "its m - theory lift would correspond to a rigid 7-dimensional @xmath3 singularity , and is the basic building block for engineering chiral theories using @xmath3 geometries ; the chiral multiplet arises from m2-brane wrapping a collapsed two - cycle . in this sense , our configurations are more complicated , and what they provide is a consistent embedding of this building block singularity in a compact setup .",
    "we expect that the generic class of models described here may exhibit some interesting phenomena in this context , in particular the existence of non - perturbative equivalences among seemingly different models , which nonetheless share the same m - theory lift , in analogy with @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the type iia transitions in which intersecting d6-branes recombine ( the t - dual of the small instanton transitions ) would have interesting m - theory descriptions , in which the topology of the @xmath3 space changes . it would be interesting to explore possible connections of such process with @xcite .",
    "we hope that our explicit constructions may provide a useful laboratory to probe new ideas in this exciting development .",
    "in this paper , we constructed four - dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric type ii orientifolds with branes at angles .",
    "we provided the first d - brane construction of a three - family @xmath0 supersymmetric vacuum solution with the standard model gauge group @xmath123 as part of the gauge structure .",
    "we have also illustrated other possibilities for model building by constructing a supersymmetric gut model with ( four ) chiral families and adjoint higgs multiplets , the first example of its kind in the orientifold setup .",
    "although we have not discussed here , it is quite straightforward to construct other extensions of the standard model , such as the left - right symmetric models ( _ e.g. _ , the pati - salam type ) .    even though our models are explicit string realizations of the brane - world scenario , they generically require a high string scale . in models with intersecting d6-branes ,",
    "the experimental bounds on masses of kaluza - klein replicas of standard model gauge bosons imply that the internal dimension can not be large ( since there is no dimension transverse to _ all _ standard model branes ) .",
    "hence , a large planck mass can be generated only from a large string scale , and not from a large volume .",
    "specifically , one obtains g_ym^2 m_p^(4d ) = m_s where @xmath124 is the volume of the cycle wrapped by the corresponding brane , and @xmath125 is the total internal volume . moreover",
    ", large anisotropies in the internal space would generically reflect in different gauge couplings for different gauge group factors . for nearly isotropic configurations ,",
    "the string scale is of the order of the planck scale .",
    "there is however more freedom than in the traditional heterotic approach , and it could be used to lower the string scale to , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath126 gev , a certainly desirable choice for gut models .    another interesting feature of this class of models with branes at angles is the structure of the yukawa couplings . since the quarks , leptons and higgs fields are located at different intersections of the branes , the yukawa couplings @xmath127 are generically exponentially suppressed by the area @xmath128 of the string world - sheet stretching between the locations of these fields ( measured in string units ) @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath129 these exponential factors may provide an interesting geometrical explanation for the observed fermion masses . in order for the yukawa couplings not to be negligibly small",
    ", the area of the string world - sheet ( which is typically the compactification scale ) can not be much larger than the string length , so internal dimensions should be of the order of the string scale .",
    "note that in addition to the above yukawa couplings , there are generically couplings among @xmath38 , @xmath55 and @xmath130 fields , and among @xmath38 fields .",
    "these couplings are not exponentially suppressed .",
    "therefore , in studying the resulting phenomenology , one should examine whether they may pose phenomenologically challenges to this general class of models involving branes at angles .",
    "hopefully , they might be useful , _ e.g. _ , to get rid of the unwanted non - chiral matter in the @xmath38 sector , even though we have no concrete proposal in this respect .",
    "we also note in passing that unlike the recent models in @xcite , our models have absolute proton stability due to symmetries ( as discussed in @xcite ) .    the basic model building rules that we have constructed , allow for the exploration of a potentially large class of supersymmetric models .",
    "in particular , to simplify the conditions from supersymmetry , we have mainly restricted our search to d6-branes at angles of the form @xmath131 , @xmath132 or @xmath133 . it is quite remarkable that within this restricted class of models , there exist three - family standard - like models .",
    "the three - family model is however not fully realistic , as it contains extra vector - like multiplets as well as exotic chiral matter .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible that variants of this ( or other ) model(s ) may eliminate these additional states , and lead to solutions closer to the standard model ( in particular , it would be interesting to reproduce the very economical spectrum structure in @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , a detailed search of realistic models deserves further investigation .    in this regard ,",
    "it is interesting to note that supersymmetric d6-branes with three non - trivial angles , say @xmath134 , contribute to some tadpole conditions ( but not all ! ) with the same sign as that of the o6-planes .",
    "this implies that even though the configuration is supersymmetric , the branes can carry negative rr charges under some rr forms in the dimensional reduction on the internal space .",
    "this allows for more flexibility in satisfying the tadpole conditions , and may give more room for embedding of the standard model .",
    "the general class of models with branes at angles are connected to familiar orientifolds by ( the t - dual of ) small instanton transitions .",
    "for instance , the three - family model we presented is connected by such a transition to the non - chiral @xmath135 orientifold in @xcite . in the picture of d6-branes at angles",
    ", the transition amounts to a recombination of the intersecting cycles , resulting in d6-branes not fully aligned with the o6-planes , and leading to chiral matter .",
    "the recombination description provides a simple setup to analyze these transitions , and their field theory interpretation in detail .",
    "we have also discussed the main physical effects when the untwisted moduli are chosen away from the supersymmetric point .",
    "the model develops fi terms proportional to the deviation from the supersymmetric situation .",
    "the corresponding non - zero d - terms in general force some scalars to acquire vev s and restore supersymmetry at the restabilized vacuum .",
    "this is the field theory counterpart of a process in which the intersecting d6-branes , non - supersymmetric in the new situation , recombine and wrap a new 3-cycle which is supersymmetric in the new , deformed , complex structure .    as this general class of supersymmetric orientifold models",
    "involve only d6-branes and o6-planes , their m - theory lift correspond to compactifications on purely geometrical background , in fact , a compact , singular 7-manifold with @xmath3 holonomy .",
    "given the recent interest in m - theory compactifications on such spaces , we expect our general class of orientifold models may lead to new insights into the construction of spaces with special holonomy leading to four - dimensional gauge theories with chiral fermions , and into new physical phenomena in such compactifications .",
    "there are many promising avenues to explore in supersymmetric orientifolds with d6-branes at angles , both from the phenomenological and the theoretical viewpoints .",

    "<S> we construct @xmath0 supersymmetric four - dimensional orientifolds of type iia on @xmath1 with d6-branes intersecting at angles . </S>",
    "<S> the use of d6-branes not fully aligned with the o6-planes in the model allows for a construction of many supersymmetric models with chiral matter , including those with the standard model and grand unified gauge groups . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a search for realistic gauge sectors , and construct the first example of a supersymmetric type ii orientifold with @xmath2 gauge group and three quark - lepton families . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the supersymmetric standard model content , the model contains right - handed neutrinos , a ( chiral but anomaly - free ) set of exotic multiplets , and diverse vector - like multiplets . </S>",
    "<S> the general class of these constructions are related to familiar type ii orientifolds by small instanton transitions , which in some cases change the number of generations , as discussed in specific models . </S>",
    "<S> these constructions are supersymmetric only for special choices of untwisted moduli . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss the supersymmetry breaking effects away from that point . </S>",
    "<S> the m - theory lift of this general class of supersymmetric orientifold models should correspond to purely geometrical backgrounds admitting a singular @xmath3 holonomy metric and leading to four - dimensional m - theory vacua with chiral fermions .    </S>",
