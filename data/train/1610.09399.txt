    "there is currently an increasing interest in studying and developing new systems and devices that could process information using the spin of the electron , which is the essence of the field of spintronics.@xcite in particular , a considerable number of possibilities stem from the implementation of effective couplings derived from microscopic spin - orbit ( so ) interactions , chief among them the rashba spin - orbit coupling ( rsoc ) which appears in systems with structural inversion asymmetry.@xcite    it has been recently noticed@xcite that a strong spin torque can be induced on ferromagnets ( fm ) coupled to a two - dimensional ( 2d ) layer with rashba soc .",
    "this process was observed when an electrical current flows in the plane of a co layer with asymmetric pt and alox interfaces.@xcite even more recently , it has been discussed the possibility of an analogous relativistic so torque appearing when an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) layer is coupled to a conducting layer containing rsoc.@xcite it was also suggested that this possibility could be realized in bulk mn@xmath0au , which although is centrosymmetric , it can be divided into two sublattices that separately have broken inversion symmetry .",
    "this second possibility is referred to as a nel so torque ( nsot ) , to differentiate it from the previously mentioned fm so torque ( fsot ) . in these two systems ,",
    "the fm or afm order in the magnetic layer is fixed due to a large enough exchange interaction among localized magnetic moments .",
    "possible advantages of spintronic devices involving afm layers , for example their fast magnetic dynamics and the insensitivity to stray fields , are well - known.@xcite remarkably , it was recently found that the nsot could drive an antiferromagnetic domain wall at velocities two orders of magnitude greater than the ones in ferromagnets.@xcite    rashba so coupling leads to the spin - hall effect @xcite which manifests itself on finite width systems or strips , as spin accumulation at the strip edges .",
    "@xcite perhaps the most important quantity related to these effects is the spin - hall conductivity which in clean 2d systems turned out to be a constant independent of the rashba strength for a wide range of electron fillings.@xcite subsequent studies lead to the conclusion that the spin - hall conductivity vanishes in the presence of scattering.@xcite this result led in turn to some controversial interpretation of experimental data .",
    "most of this theoretical work has been performed on unbounded 2d systems and using a parabolic band , that is , with infinite bandwidth .",
    "many shortcomings and peculiar results obtained for these systems have been stressed in the literature .",
    "specifically , the above mentioned controversy concerning the spin - hal conductivity was settled down once the effect of parabolic bands was recognized.@xcite on the other hand , planar strips , rather than unbounded 2d systems , and tight - binding bands with finite bandwidth , are in general more realistic , particularly for new materials or mechanisms which have been proposed for spintronic devices and where larger electron fillings may be involved , such as for example , those involving laalo@xmath1/srtio@xmath1",
    "interfaces.@xcite    hence , the purpose of the present work is to study the optical and spin - hall conductivities of conducting strips with a rashba soc in contact with a magnetized slab with fm or afm orders .",
    "although the above mentioned fsot and nsot occur in off - equilibrium systems , the study of an appropriate microscopic model hamiltonian in second quantization at equilibrium , and within linear response , could shed some light on the behavior of systems in off - equilibrium regimes , particularly for strips . for the sake of comparison , the case of isolated rashba conducting strips , that is , not connected to a magnetic layer , will also be studied . at equilibrium , it is also interesting to examine the rashba helical currents,@xcite which appear due to the presence of open boundaries , and it will be shown that their behavior is correlated with the one observed through the optical and spin - hall conductivities .",
    "these studies are performed assuming that the magnetic moments are always collinear .",
    "although this assumption is realistic since the exchange interaction between moments in the coupled layer is typically very large,@xcite in the final section various possible instabilities of the afm order obtained by minimizing the hamiltonian with respect to arbitrary orientation of the magnetic moments will be examined .",
    "the hamiltonian here studied is @xmath2 where @xcite : @xmath3 \\nonumber   \\\\ h_{int } & = & - j_{sd } \\sum_{l } { \\bf s}_l \\cdot { \\bf \\hat{s}}_l          + j \\sum_{<l , m > } { \\bf s}_l \\cdot { \\bf s}_m \\label{ham1orb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 are sites on a square lattice , located on the @xmath5-plane , @xmath6 are the localized magnetic moments , assumed classical , and @xmath7 are the spin of the conduction electrons ( its operator nature is made explicit for later usage ) .",
    "the longitudinal ( transversal ) direction of the strip corresponds to the @xmath8 axis ( @xmath9 axis ) .",
    "@xmath10 is the noninteracting part , which includes the hopping and rsoc terms with coupling constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the rsoc term corresponds to an effective rashba electric field along the @xmath13-axis , i.e. perpendicular to the plane of the strip .",
    "since both terms in @xmath10 contribute to the total kinetic energy , we choose the normalization @xmath14 , whose square root will then be adopted as the unit of energy . with this normalization ,",
    "the kinetic energy , and hence the total energy for fixed @xmath15 , turns out to be approximately constant as @xmath16 is varied.@xcite hence , all the physical properties studied in the following will solely depend on the ratio @xmath16 , for given values of @xmath17 .",
    "the interacting part of the hamiltonian contains a ferromagnetic coupling between conduction electrons and localized magnetic moments with strength @xmath18 , and an exchange interaction between magnetic moments with coupling @xmath19 .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ ham1orb ] ) is just a ferromagnetic kondo lattice model with a rashba so coupling .    for the fm case",
    ", a value of @xmath20 will be adopted , which corresponds to the case of well - separated spin - up and spin - down conduction bands . for @xmath21 ,",
    "the bands are partially separated and in this case the afm would be energetically favourable if they are allowed to rotate , for @xmath22.@xcite for this reason the afm order will be studied for @xmath21 , although some results for @xmath20 will be also presented . in general , results do not qualitative change in this range of @xmath18 . since fm and afm orders are put by hand ,",
    "the value of @xmath19 is irrelevant since it only adds a constant to the total energy .",
    "the direction of the magnetic moments is adopted to be along the @xmath13-axis .",
    "since model ( [ ham1orb ] ) corresponds to a quantization axis along the @xmath13-axis , it is expected that results will depend on the direction of the magnetic moments , and this issue will be examined in the final section . in addition , for small values of @xmath23 , even in equilibrium , if the individual magnetic moments are allowed to freely rotate , both the fm and the afm states will become unstable with respect to various spiral and double spiral states .",
    "the study of some of these instabilities is also deferred to the final section .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ ham1orb ] ) will be studied on strips of length @xmath24 and width @xmath25 , with periodic ( open ) boundary conditions along the longitudinal ( transversal ) direction .",
    "@xmath26 , is the number of sites on the strip .    for classical localized magnetic moments , which is the assumption usually adopted in this context ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes an extended tight - binding problem which is solved by numerical exact diagonalization for clusters with @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in all results presented below",
    ", finite size effects with respect to @xmath24 are negligible .",
    "all results presented below correspond to quarter filling , @xmath29 .",
    "the main quantities studied are the spin - conserving currents , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , defined as the expectation value of the operator : @xmath33 in units where the electron charge @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , and the spin - flipping currents , @xmath36 , which are the expectation value of the operators : @xmath37    these expressions can be obtained in an standard way by introducing appropriate peierls factors in the hamiltonian ( [ ham1orb ] ) and taking the first derivative with respect to the magnetic flux .",
    "these currents also satisfy the charge conservation law , given generically by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the occupation number operator and @xmath40 is the time , as long as @xmath41 $ ] , which will be further discussed below .    in equilibrium ,",
    "due to translation invariance along @xmath8 , all currents along @xmath8 depend only on the chain position given by @xmath9 . in all the cases analyzed below , in the absence of external electromagnetic sources , the so currents along the strip direction are zero , and all vertical currents are also zero , except for the case of a constant orientation of the magnetic moments forming an angle @xmath42 considered in section  [ afm_ins ] , where a more complex pattern appears .",
    "the rashba helical currents ( rhcs ) , are counter - propagating spin - up and spin - down electron currents , that is of hopping or spin - conserving nature , at each link at the lattice,@xcite and they appear due to the rsoc acting on both @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions on the strip , in equilibrium and in the absence of any external electromagnetic field . it should be emphasized that they appear as a consequence of some boundary imposed on the system , or eventually in the presence of impurities.@xcite their existence can be inferred at an effective level@xcite or by the structure of the rsoc.@xcite of course , the total current along the strip is zero . in the following",

    "alternatively , the magnetic moment orientation may be fixed by the structure of the materials involved in a given device , so it is interesting to examine the dependence of transport properties with different orientations . in the following two different global orientations of the magnetic moments , @xmath42 and @xmath135 , with @xmath136 , will be analyzed . resuming the comment after eq .",

    "the orientation of the magnetic moments in one sublattice is given by @xmath144 , and the magnetic moments on the other sublattice have the opposite directions thus keeping locally the afm order , as illustrated in fig .  [ fig9](a ) .",

    "notice that in the double - spiral region ( @xmath151 ) , the small value of @xmath85 is not the result of the cancelation between the two contributions , @xmath128 and @xmath124 , but from the sum of two small values of them .    for @xmath21 or smaller , the afm order is also unstable towards an order that is staggered along the @xmath9-direction and spiral along the @xmath8-direction , with @xmath144 , @xmath145 varying linearly between 0 for @xmath152 , and @xmath135 for @xmath153 .",
    "this instability of the afm order , driven by the conduction electrons , also disappears for @xmath154 .",

    "a systematic study of these spiral orders will be presented in a forthcoming study.@xcite",
    "in this work , the effects of finite strip widths on transport properties of rashba conducting strips coupled to layers with various magnetic orders have been studied numerically at zero temperature .    in the first place",
    ", it was found that for the uncoupled rashba strip ( or coupled to a non - magnetic layer ) , the drude weight slightly decreases with the rashba so coupling , and has a weak dependence with @xmath25 . for a rashba strip coupled to a fm layer , the drude weight also slightly decreases with @xmath16 but it is strongly reduced by increasing the strip width . in both cases ,",
    "the rashba so coupling reduces the drude weight through processes involving solely the so or spin - flipping currents .",
    "in addition , in the case of the fm coupling , the processes contributing to the optical conductivity are of interband origin , that is , connecting states with opposite signs of @xmath102 .",
    "in contrast , for the uncoupled rashba strips , these processes are completely of interband nature for the narrowest strip with @xmath64 , but the contribution from intraband transitions starts to grow with increasing @xmath25 until it becomes approximately equal to the one of interband transitions , in the whole range of @xmath16 examined .    for the afm coupled layer , due to the opening of gaps in the single - particle spectrum , the drude weight has a more complex behavior . for all strip widths and rashba so couplings considered , its value is in general much smaller than for the other two cases studied , and it is much strongly supressed by @xmath16 .",
    "this suppression is due both to processes involving spin - conserving and spin - flipping currents . for the marrowest strips , @xmath123",
    ", @xmath73 even vanishes at some finite value of @xmath16 .",
    "certainly , this different behavior with respect to the other two cases , which are metallic , indicates the proximity to an insulating behavior in the afm case",
    ".    of course , the most relevant results for spintronic applications are those concerning the spin - hall conductivity . in this sense ,",
    "the main result is that @xmath85 in the coupled afm system is nearly two orders of magnitude larger than the one in the coupled fm system for virtually all values of @xmath25 and @xmath16",
    ". it would be tempting to relate this result with the recent finding of nel - spin orbit torques driving domain walls at velocities two orders of magnitude greater than the ones in ferromagnets,@xcite but this feature belongs to off - equilibrium regimes .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that , for strips coupled to an afm layer , a larger value of @xmath85 is achieved for narrow ( wide ) strips at large ( small ) values of the rashba so coupling .",
    "the crossover between both regimes occurs at a value of @xmath16 that approximately coincides with the value at which a peak appears on the edge helical currents .",
    "actually , the behavior of @xmath85 with @xmath25 and @xmath16 is quite similar to the one obtained for uncoupled rashba strips .",
    "however , in the uncoupled case , @xmath85 is entirely due to processes involving charge so currents along @xmath8 and spin hopping currents along @xmath9 , while in the afm case , there are also contributions from processes involving spin hopping currents along @xmath9 , although these contributions have opposite sign to the former ones , except for @xmath157 .    the orientation of the magnetic moments for the afm coupled layer@xcite has also been examined .",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath47 , @xmath85 is largest at small @xmath16 when the magnetic moments are oriented along the @xmath13-direction , while for magnetic moments oriented along the @xmath8-axis , which is the case studied in ref .  , @xmath85 is largest at large @xmath16 .    finally , in systems where the conducting - magnetic layers exchange @xmath18 is due to a hund coupling between conducting and localized orbitals of a transition metal oxide , which may be the case of devices involving srtio@xmath1 interfaces , the ordering of the magnetic moments is determined by the dynamics of the competing degrees of freedom . in these systems ,",
    "the afm order become unstable at small and intermediate values of @xmath16 with respect to a double spiral order , where both the drude weight and @xmath85 essentially vanish for all @xmath25 .",
