    "the universe appears to be accelerating and the nature of dark energy ( de ) , which drives this acceleration , is a subject of much current debate among cosmologists .",
    "the cosmological constant is the simplest possibility , but evolving dark energy models have also been suggested and one of the goals of current cosmological studies is to differentiate between these different types of models .",
    "type ia supernovae treated as standardized candles provided the first indications that the expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite and one expects that the nature of dark energy will be further revealed by the study of these objects in conjunction with other data sets ( cmb , lss etc . ) .",
    "recently there have been several data releases from the two supernova teams @xcite , making the total number of supernovae almost double that known previously .",
    "using these datasets , we reconstructed the dark energy density and equation of state in two papers @xcite ( hereafter papers i and ii ) in an attempt to understand the nature of dark energy . in these works",
    ", we found that the current supernova data appears to favour an evolving dark energy model with @xmath2 at present and that at @xmath3 , the evolving model is at least as probable as the cosmological constant .",
    "this result soon found support in other works ( see for instance @xcite etc . ) .",
    "recently , in @xcite , doubts have been expressed as to the reliability of the fitting procedure used in papers i and ii .",
    "hence in this work we re - examine the reconstruction process used in these two papers to check whether the results obtained in papers i & ii were merely a consequence of the analysis or whether they do actually reflect a property of the universe .",
    "the sne observations measure the luminosity distance @xmath4 . from this ,",
    "information about the cosmological parameters may be obtained through the hubble parameter , which in a spatially flat universe is related to the luminosity distance quite simply by @xcite h(z ) = ^-1 .",
    "the dark energy density is defined as : [ eq : dens ] _ de= , where @xmath5 is the present day critical density of an frw universe , and @xmath1 is the present day matter density with respect to the critical density",
    ".    information extracted from sne observations regarding @xmath4 therefore translates directly into knowledge of @xmath6 , the dark energy density , and , through @xcite [ eq : state ] q(x ) & = & - x -1  , + w(x ) & = & 2 q(x ) - 1 3 ( 1 - ( x ) )  ;  x=1+z , into knowledge about the deceleration parameter of the universe and the equation of state of dark energy .    one route to the reconstruction of de lies in the construction of an ansatz for one of the three quantities : @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "the ansatz must of course be sufficiently versatile to accommodate a large class of de models . in papers i and ii",
    "we have used a polynomial fit to dark energy density of the form : h(x ) = = x^3 + a_0 + a_1x + a_2 x^2^ ,  x= 1+z , [ eq : taylor ] where @xmath9 .",
    "note that this ansatz should not be considered as a truncated taylor series for @xmath10 .",
    "rather , it is an interpolating fit for @xmath10 having the right behaviour for small and large values of @xmath11 .",
    "the number of terms in this fit is sufficient given the amount and accuracy of the present supernovae data . with more and better data in the future ,",
    "more terms with intermediate ( , half - integer ) powers of @xmath12 may be added to it .",
    "this is equivalent to the following ansatz for de density ( with respect to the critical density ) : _ de(x ) = _",
    "de/= a_0 + a_1x + a_2 x^2 , which is exact for the cosmological constant @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) and for de models with @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the corresponding expression for the equation of state of de is : [ eq : state1 ] w(x)=-1 + .",
    "the likelihood for the parameters of the ansatz can be determined by minimising a @xmath19-statistic : ^2(h_0,,p_j)=_i , where @xmath20 is the extinction corrected distance modulus for sne at redshift @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the uncertainty in the individual distance moduli ( including the uncertainty in galaxy redshifts due to a peculiar velocity of @xmath23 km / s ) , and @xmath24 are the parameters of the ansatz used .",

    "we find that the cosmological constant is just within the @xmath3 confidence level in the @xmath27 plane .",
    "the variation of dark energy density and equation of state of dark energy is also shown , and both show indications of evolution .",
    "we note that these results are stable to the addition of extra terms such as @xmath28 or @xmath29 terms to the ansatz .",
    "the region where the dark energy density becomes less than zero for the redshift range @xmath30 ( the redshift range in which current supernova data is available ) is shown as the shaded grey region in figure  [ fig : h_exp_g]a .",
    "we see that a portion of the @xmath31 confidence level lies in the region where dark energy density goes to zero and therefore @xmath32 blows up .    figure  [ fig : h_exp_g_cmb_constr ] shows the results of reconstruction when results from the wmap experiment are incorporated and the priors @xmath33 and @xmath34 are assumed . in this case",
    "the time - evolution of de is considerably weaker and more in agreement with a cosmological constant .",
    "( note however that evolving de is preferred over a cosmological constant by the combined sne+wmap data if @xmath35 as shown in paper ii , @xcite . )",
    "= 3.4 in    we now look at the reconstruction exercise in some detail to understand whether the results obtained in papers i and ii are biased due to inherent weaknesses in the ansatz used or whether these results can be trusted to reflect the true nature of dark energy .      in @xcite , the ansatz  ( [ eq : taylor ] ) was criticised for being biased and giving misleading information about the nature of dark energy .",
    "we show here that this is not the case and the ansatz is sufficiently robust to be a reliable probe of the nature of dark energy . in the figure  [ fig : err ]",
    ", we show the _ maximum deviation _ between the actual value of the luminosity distance and that calculated using the ansatz  ( [ eq : taylor ] ) for simulations of different physically well motivated models of dark energy such as quintessence , chaplygin gas , and the sugra potential . from ( [ eq : taylor ] ) it is clear that for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , this ansatz returns exact values .",
    "however , even for models for which it is not exact , the ansatz ( [ eq : taylor ] ) still recovers the luminosity distance to within @xmath39 accuracy in the redshift range relevant for sne observations .",
    "these results reassure us that for a large class of models , the ansatz can be trusted to recover cosmological quantities to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "( other tests of the ansatz ( [ eq : taylor ] ) have been reported in @xcite . )      in @xcite the ansatz ( [ eq : taylor ] ) has been criticized on the grounds that it allows the de density to become negative during the course of cosmological evolution .",
    "we would like to emphasise that this is not necessarily a bad thing since there is no a - priori reason for the de density to remain positive throughout its evolution and models do exist in which @xmath40 for a substantial duration of time  see for instance @xcite etc .",
    "indeed the purpose of the construction of an ansatz such as ( [ eq : taylor ] ) is to endow it with sufficient flexibility so that it is able to reproduce the behaviour of a sufficiently large class of de models . ) is unlikely to give good results if applied to de which evolves extremely rapidly with time such as the rapidly oscillating models of @xcite . ] in addition , a negative value for the dark energy density could also be an indication that the matter density has been over estimated , so one should not arbitrarily exclude the region of parameter space where @xmath41 as suggested by @xcite .",
    "hence we have not a priori put a constraint of positivity on the dark energy density in our analysis",
    ". however , one point to note is that the region where dark energy density vanishes is very close to the cosmological constant ( @xmath42 ) in parameter space , so there is a chance that if the best - fit to the data is near this point then the best - fit @xmath32 or errors in it may blow up .",
    "this need not always happen , for instance in the figure  [ fig : h_exp_g_cmb_constr ] , the best - fit is close to the cosmological constant , but the errors on @xmath32 are well - behaved . the same is seen in figure 6 of paper i. however , in case the best - fit equation of state or the errors in it do blow up , we naturally have to be careful about whether this truly indicates some exotic form of dark energy , or whether it is more consistent with the cosmological constant .",
    "it is also important to point out that the equation of state parameter need not always be the best characteristic of dark energy @xcite , and in such cases it is useful to characterize de using other cosmological parameters ( which do not exhibit this divergence ) , such as the deceleration parameter and the statefinder pair @xcite . in this context",
    "it is worth noting that the pressure of dark energy : @xmath43 is well - behaved for this ansatz even when @xmath41 , and this quantity can therefore be used to draw conclusions on the nature of dark energy .",
    "= 2.4 in    the errors on the equation of state in figure  [ fig : h_exp_g](c ) appear to be non - monotonic .",
    "this seems somewhat counter - intuitive .",
    "low redshift behaviour of the equation of state affects the luminosity distance at all higher redshifts , while high redshift behaviour affects fewer points .",
    "this leads to an expectation that high-@xmath11 behaviour of the equation of state should be poorly constrained as opposed to the low-@xmath11 behaviour .",
    "however , we saw in papers i & ii that the errors in @xmath8 actually decrease with redshift .",
    "we investigate this matter using the fisher matrix error bars .    in an analysis which uses an ansatz with @xmath44 parameters @xmath45 ,",
    "the fisher information matrix is defined to be f_ij , where @xmath46 , @xmath47 being the likelihood . for an unbiased estimator , the errors on the parameters will follow the cramr - rao inequality : @xmath48 .",
    "since the likelihood function is approximately gaussian near the maximum likelihood ( ml ) point , the covariance matrix for a maximum likelihood estimator is given by ( c^-1)_ij .",
    "the fisher information matrix is therefore simply the expectation value of the inverse of the covariance matrix at the ml - point .",
    "given the covariance matrix , the error on any cosmological quantity @xmath49 is given by : [ eq : propagate ] _",
    "q^2 = _ i=1^n ( ) ^2 c_ii+2 _",
    "i=1^n _ j = i+1^n ( ) ( ) c_ij .",
    "thus the nature of the errors on a quantity will depend essentially on the manner in which it is related to the parameters of the system .",
    "the errors on the equation of state for the ansatz ( [ eq : taylor ] ) can now be calculated using equations  ( [ eq : taylor ] ) and  ( [ eq : propagate ] ) , and has the somewhat complicated expression : [ eq : err_w ] _",
    "w^2(x ) = , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the best - fit values of the parameters .    from this expression",
    "it is difficult to predict whether the errors should increase with redshift or not .",
    "indeed that would depend on the value and sign of the quantities @xmath52 .",
    "we calculate the errors around the best - fit for the 156 sne `` gold '' dataset of @xcite using this procedure that the @xmath53 confidence levels thus calculated on the equation of state ( shown in figure  [ fig : err_w ] ) are almost identical to those shown in figure  [ fig : h_exp_g](c ) .",
    "thus the ansatz  ( [ eq : taylor ] ) need not show monotonically increasing errors in @xmath32 with redshift and in this way may differ from other fitting functions , for instance approximations to the equation of state of dark energy as proposed in @xcite or @xcite , which may show just the opposite tendency .",
    "this indicates that the nature of error bars are affected by the quantity being approximated . in the limit of infinite terms in the expansion of various quantities",
    "all the methods should produce identical result . the practical need for truncating",
    "these expansions make these approximations slightly different from each other .",
    "more specifically , we require setting of priors f(z ) & = & _ i=0^ a_n z^n + a_n & = & 0 ;  ( n > n_p ) where @xmath54 could be @xmath6 , @xmath8 or any other physical quantity and @xmath55 is the chosen number of parameters .",
    "the non - linear priors in the above equation make different finite expansions inequivalent . since we do not know for certain if the underlying model for the accelerating expansion involves an energy component with negative pressure in a frw setting we are forced to choose one of the alternatives for approximations .",
    "we hope that with increasingly high quality data the effect of such truncations will eventually disappear .",
    "the dark energy equation of state for the ansatz  ( [ eq : taylor ] ) can have many different forms depending on the values of @xmath51 .",
    "this ansatz gives us an exact representation of the cosmological constant ( @xmath42 ) and it is an unbiased estimator for the @xmath56cdm model .",
    "however , it is also true that the statistical noise inherently present in the data will never allow us to measure @xmath51 to be exactly equal to zero even in this case .",
    "thus if the underlying model of the universe is the cosmological constant , then by fitting an ansatz which has more parameters than required , we are fitting a bit of noise as well .",
    "this fact is true for _ any _ ansatz and not just ( [ eq : taylor ] ) .",
    "the deviation of the best - fit from the cosmological constant in such a case is given by : w _ a_1 + a_2 , the @xmath57 curve would increasingly depart from the cosmological constant with redshift .",
    "the same tendency would be seen if we consider a linear ansatz in the equation of state : @xmath58 .",
    "this would also diverge from the cosmological constant ( @xmath59 ) at high redshifts for even a small non - zero @xmath60 , since @xmath61 .",
    "such divergence is the inevitable price we pay for not knowing the `` true '' nature of dark energy and for using an ansatz to explore it . in practice one",
    "is free to choose either of two possibilities : ( i ) assume that the underlying model has certain characteristics ( such as constant equation of state ) and thus face the danger of losing information the pitfalls of using this approach were highlighted in @xcite , or ( ii ) we may choose to make no such assumptions and consider models with a somewhat larger number of parameters .",
    "we have adopted ( ii ) in papers i & ii and believe that , given the redshift range and statistical noise of the data currently available , it is not unreasonable to assume that the errors for the ansatz  ( [ eq : taylor ] ) will not be large enough to cause the best - fit to diverge significantly from the underlying model irrespective of whether the model is that of the cosmological constant or some other form of dark energy .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ fig : sim_h_exp_dens](a ) for simulations of the cosmological constant model .",
    "= 2.4 in    in our analysis of the supernova data we find that for a fixed value of @xmath1 , the parameters @xmath51 which are favoured by the data are strongly correlated . for @xmath62 , from the confidence levels of figure  [",
    "fig : h_exp_g](a ) we may conclude that approximately , @xmath63 for points favoured by the data .",
    "contrary to what is claimed in @xcite this correlation is not something that has been put into the analysis by hand , rather it is a consequence of the observational data .",
    "other fits , such as the linder fit to the equation of state @xcite , have also shown a strong correlation between its parameters .",
    "we need to examine what effect , if any , this correlation has on the nature of dark energy . from expression ( [ eq : state1 ] ) for the equation of state for dark energy , we see that @xmath36 at a redshift of @xmath64 . therefore , for @xmath62 , @xmath36 at @xmath65 .",
    "this implies that since most curves would cross @xmath36 at approximately this redshift , there will be a `` sweet - spot '' at @xmath65 for the equation of state .",
    "this can be clearly seen in the figure  [ fig : h_exp_g](c ) .",
    "the presence of sweet - spots at different redshifts for different ansatz is something which has been studied earlier , for example in @xcite , and the community agrees that the presence or absence of a sweet - spot is simply a consequence of the ansatz used and does not signify any extra information about the underlying model .",
    "does the fact that @xmath32 crosses @xmath66 at this redshift mean that the ansatz forces the equation of state to evolve in a particular direction ?",
    "in figure  [ fig : h_exp_correl ] , we plot the behaviour of @xmath32 for different values of the parameters @xmath51 which follow the constraint @xmath67 .",
    "we see that the cosmological constant is allowed by this constraint , as are many other models .",
    "one can have extremely mild evolution of @xmath32 , or more rapid evolution of @xmath32 , one can have @xmath32 which blows up , @xmath32 which goes from a more negative ( @xmath68 ) value to a less negative ( @xmath69 ) value or vice versa .",
    "in short this constraint does not force the equation of state to evolve at a particular rate in a particular direction , but leaves a great deal of freedom . also ,",
    "it is important to note that this is not a constraint that has been imposed by hand in the analysis , it is simply an outcome of the analysis .",
    "there are many points in the @xmath51 parameter space for which the equation of state is always @xmath70 and shows little evolution .",
    "the ansatz does not preclude these points , it is the data which chooses a particular evolving dark energy model over other possibilities . we therefore conclude that the correlation seen in the parameters @xmath51 does not signify any bias in the results and ( contrary to the claims of @xcite ) the ansatz does not `` force '' evolution of the dark energy equation of state .      in paper i , we showed that the results obtained by the ansatz  ( [ eq : taylor ] ) can also be reproduced using other fitting functions , such as the fits to the equation of state used in @xcite and @xcite . for both these fits , the equation of state shows an evolution which is remarkably similar to that found using ( [ eq : taylor ] ) .",
    "it is interesting that our results have found support in the independent analysis carried out by other groups which also show that evolving de provides a fit that is as good ( or better ) than that provided by a cosmological constant to the current supernova data @xcite .",
    "therefore there seems to be a consensus among the different groups that , based on the sne data alone , an evolving dark energy model is a plausible alternative to the cosmological constant .",
    "( as emphasised earlier in this paper and in papers i and ii , the properties of dark energy depend crucially upon the manner in which the sne data is sampled and also upon which other sets of observations are used in conjunction with type ia supernovae . for instance , the evolution of de is least if one uses sne+wmap results together with the priors @xmath71 ; see also @xcite . )",
