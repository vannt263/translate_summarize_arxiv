    "the function @xmath1 was introduced in @xcite by weierstrass as an example supposedly given by riemann of a continuous function which is not differentiable anywhere .",
    "it was later verified by hardy @xcite that this is indeed the case except perhaps at the rational numbers of the form @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "the behavior at the remaining points was not known until 1970 , when gerver proved in @xcite that @xmath4 is actually differentiable at those rationals of the form @xmath2 while is not in the other case ( these assertions are almost evident from its graph when plotted with the aid of modern computers ; see figure  [ fig : riemann ] ) .",
    "[ fig : riemann ]     in the light of historical analysis @xcite it seems probable that riemann never made such a claim . in spite of this , @xmath4 has become known in the literature as `` riemann s example '' , and its regularity has been extensively studied by several authors . what lies underneath its apparently chaotic behavior is the action of a certain subgroup of @xmath5 on jacobi s theta function @xmath6 which is a modular form of weight @xmath7 .",
    "the connection can be formally stated as @xmath8 .",
    "this leads to very fruitful strategies that can be used to study @xmath4 : for example , in @xcite and @xcite the derivative is understood as a certain wavelet transform and general theorems are applied which relate bounds on one side of the transform with regularity on the other ; while in @xcite an approximate functional equation for @xmath4 is deduced integrating the one for @xmath9 .    in the same spirit",
    ", if we are given any modular form of positive weight for a subgroup of finite index of @xmath5 one can perform a formal fractional integration on its fourier series to force it to converge to a continuous function on all the real line .",
    "the regularity of the resulting function ( understood in several ways ) has been studied for certain limited ranges in @xcite and more recently @xcite . in this last paper , for example , chamizo _ et al .",
    "_ determine under some restrictions the so called pointwise hlder exponent , which measures how well a function can be locally approximated by polynomials .    in this paper",
    "we intertwine the wavelet transform and approximate functional equation approaches in order to study the general case .",
    "indeed neither technique suffices to determine the pointwise hlder exponent everywhere , and one needs to resort to a combination of them .",
    "we also determine unconditionally other related local exponents , and characterize the rational points at which the fractional integral is differentiable .",
    "moreover we compute the spectrum of singularities , which consists of the hausdorff dimension of the sets where the function attains a certain pointwise hlder exponent . for the precise definitions",
    "see  [ sec : results ] .    as noted by duistermaat in @xcite , the approximate functional equation",
    "deepens our understanding of the graph of these functions .",
    "in particular it shows that around rational numbers we should expect oscillations of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a periodic function also given by a fractional integral of a modular form ( these oscillations are clearly visible in figure  [ fig : riemann ] ) .",
    "another consequence of the functional equation is that these graphs are fractal in the sense that they satisfy a very particular kind of approximate self - similarity around rational numbers and quadratic surds .",
    "these features are studied in detail in the case of `` riemann s example '' , and all the possibilities for @xmath11 are determined .",
    "we also perform a brief analysis of the case of cusp forms for the group @xmath0 , that is , the subgroup of @xmath5 consisting of those matrices whose bottom - left entry is divisible by @xmath12 . in this setting the vector space of cusp forms has a basis consisting of normalized eigenfunctions for all the hecke operators , and the elements of this basis are classified into newforms and oldforms , depending on whether they originate on @xmath0 or derive from forms on @xmath13 for some proper divisor @xmath14 of @xmath12 ( see @xcite ) . the modularity theorem ( one of the major mathematical achievements of contemporary mathematics ) states that there is a correspondence between isogeny classes of elliptic curves over @xmath15 of conductor @xmath12 and newforms of weight @xmath16 for the group @xmath0 and trivial multiplier system .",
    "the coefficients of these newforms coincide with those of the hasse - weil l - function of any elliptic curve in the associated isogeny class .",
    "it is known that some arithmetic properties of the curve are encoded into analytic properties of the l - function : the birch and swinnerton - dyer conjecture  of which some particular cases have been proven  relates the rank of the group of rational points of the curve with the order of the zero at @xmath17 of the l - function . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that some of these analytic properties are also reflected on fractional integrals of the corresponding newforms , and can be read off their graphs .    here",
    "we focus on a different aspect : we study how the action of the normalizer of @xmath0 on @xmath15 and on the newform constraints the possible set of functions @xmath11 for which we should expect oscillations of type @xmath10 around rational numbers . more precisely , we characterize when the normalizer acts transitively on @xmath15 and then prove that if some extra conditions are met we can assure @xmath11 to be , again , a fractional integral of the original newform .    the layout of this paper is the following : in  [ sec : results ] we state our main results .

    "the second one , @xmath52 , also called the restricted local hlder exponent , is more demanding in the sense that @xmath49 must be differentiable enough times for it to coincide with @xmath51 .",
    "this is in some sense like imposing that the polynomial is the actual taylor polynomial of @xmath49 .",
    "finally , @xmath53 , the local hlder exponent , requires @xmath49 not only to be differentiable in open neighborhoods , but also its derivatives to satisfy a hlder condition in them .",
    "the importance of this last one resides in the fact that it behaves well under the action of a wide class of pseudo - differential operators ( _ cf . _",
