    "it has recently been shown that a correlation exists between the rate of shear ( as determined from rotation curves ) and spiral arm pitch angle in disk galaxies@xmath5 .",
    "spiral galaxies with tighly wound spiral arms have falling rotation curves , as one proceeds to larger radii , and galaxies with loosely wound arms have rising rotation curves . as the shape of the rotation curve depends upon the mass concentration in disk galaxies , the shear rate , @xmath6 , is also dependent upon the central mass concentration . as a result the correlation found between the rate of shear and spiral arm pitch angle",
    "can be interpreted in the following way : the main determinant of spiral arm pitch angle is the central mass concentration .",
    "this is consistent with most spiral density wave models@xmath7 .",
    "it has been shown that there are differences between optical and near - infrared spiral arm morphologies . some galaxies which exhibit flocculent spiral structure in the",
    "optical often show grand - design spiral structure when observed in the near - infrared@xmath8 .",
    "also , galaxies that appear grand - design in the optical , usually have arms that bifurcate , whereas in the near - infrared , the same galaxies appear to have much smoother spiral structure@xmath9 . furthermore there is no significant correlation between optically classified hubble type and near - infrared pitch angles or bulge - to - disk ratios@xmath10 .",
    "we have used a fast fourier transform technique to measure the spiral arm pitch angles of a sample of 57 face - on spiral galaxies from the ohio state university bright spiral galaxy survey@xmath11 .",
    "our results show that there is a very good correlation between optical ( b band ) and near - infrared ( h band ) pitch angles ( figure 1 _ left _ ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that there is a correlation between optical morphological classification and near - infrared morphological classification@xmath11 .",
    "our result suggests that , although the optical and near - infrared morphologies of spiral arms can be very different on small scales , the overall pitch angle of the spiral structure remains the same in all wavebands from 0.4@xmath12 m to 2.2@xmath12 m .",
    "due to the fact that pitch angles remain very similar when measured in the optical or near - infrared , it is possible to add many more points to the correlation between the rate of shear and spiral arm pitch angles .",
    "we are involved in an optical imaging survey of the 614 brightest southern hemisphere galaxies , the carnegie nearby galaxy survey ( cngs ) . of the galaxies",
    "observed so far , 31 have measured rotation curves@xmath13 and are face - on with good enough signal to apply our fast fourier transform technique .",
    "these galaxies have hubble types in the range sa to sd .",
    "pitch angles and shear rates have been measured for these galaxies and the points have been added to a plot of shear rate versus pitch angle ( figure 1 _ middle _ ) .",
    "an excellent correlation still exists and it can be shown that the relationship between pitch angle , @xmath14 , and shear rate , @xmath6 , is @xmath15 .",
    "we have used an adiabatic infall method@xmath16 to model the formation of a disk galaxy , depending upon the initial concentration parameter@xmath17 , @xmath18 , the spin parameter , @xmath1 , and the fraction of baryons in the halo that cool , @xmath2 . in this model ,",
    "the baryons cool adiabatically and form a disk . as the baryons cool ,",
    "the dark matter gets dragged in towards the center with them , increasing the overall central mass concentration .",
    "the outputs we are interested in from the model are the central mass concentration , @xmath0 , measured as the fraction of mass within a 10 kpc radius , and the shear rate at the same radius . we have chosen this radius , since it approximately coincides with the radius at which we measured shear rate and pitch angles in our real galaxies .    the results of our model are shown in figure 1 _ right _ , which shows a plot of shear rate versus central mass concentration . in this plot",
    "the scatter in the shear rate has been chosen , such that it is equivalent to the scatter in the shear rate in figure 1 _",
    "middle_. this allows us to put constraints on the inputs .",
    "the baryonic mass fraction@xmath19 suggests that the range for the fraction of baryons that cool should be @xmath20 , and if we restrict our input to this range , an acceptable range for the spin parameter is @xmath21 .",
    "the theoretical expectation@xmath16 is that @xmath1 should be anywhere in the range from 0.01 to 0.09 , but it is possible that galaxies with @xmath22 , either do not form disks , or do not form spiral structure within their disks , and we speculate that this may be the mechanism for the formation of dwarf spheroidal and s0 galaxies .",
    "we use figure 1 _ right _ to estimate the relationship between the shear rate , @xmath6 , and the central mass concentration , @xmath0 , which is @xmath23 .",
    "this relationship , combined with the relationship between shear and pitch angle , allows us to estimate the relationship between central mass concentration and pitch angle such that @xmath24 .",
    "this equation allows a mass concentration to be estimated for any galaxy for which a pitch angle can be measured , and since spiral structure is detectable in galaxies up to @xmath25 , it is possible to measure how @xmath0 changes , in the overall population of spiral galaxies , as a function of look - back time .",
