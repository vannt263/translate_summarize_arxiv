    "two - particle interferometry is a sensitive probe of the space - time geometry of the particle emitting source . using this technique ,",
    "pion source sizes have been measured at every available relativistic heavy ion beam energy which led to the excitation function reported in @xcite .",
    "two - particle correlation also offers a large variety of observables combining different particle species .",
    "for example , two - kaon and two - proton correlation functions have been measured at the cern sps  @xcite . in this paper , we present preliminary results from two - particle correlation analyses of au+au collisions at @xmath1 gev produced by the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "two - particle correlations are studied by constructing correlation functions : @xmath2 with @xmath3 the momentum of one particle in the rest frame of pair , @xmath4 the distribution of @xmath5 for pairs of particles from the same event , and @xmath6 the @xmath5 distribution for pairs of particle from different events .",
    "note that for pairs of particles having the same mass , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the invariant relative momentum . for pairs of particles having different masses ,",
    "this relationship does nt hold and @xmath5 is the only relevant variable .",
    "transverse mass spectra  @xcite and elliptic flow analysis  @xcite suggest that there is a strong collective motion of the particles in the au+au collisions at @xmath1 gev .",
    "such flow introduces a strong correlation between the position and the momentum of the emitted particles , which reduces the apparent source size .",
    "it could explain why the analysis of two - pion correlation functions published by star  @xcite shows no anomalously large pion source size which would have indicated the formation of the quark gluon plasma .",
    "transverse flow must be accounted for in order to interpret the source size extracted from two - particle correlation analysis .",
    "we will introduce the so called `` extended blast wave model '' in order to investigate the effect of flow .",
    "we present two new analyses that are potentially more sensitive to flow effects .",
    "they both provide new independent insights on how the system looks at kinetic freeze - out , i.e. when the particles decouple .",
    "the extended blast wave model allows one to combine transverse mass spectra , elliptic flow and two - particle correlation analysis within a single framework .",
    "it is a simple parametrization of the system at kinetic freeze - out in terms of temperature , transverse flow , and source transverse radius .",
    "this approach focuses on the transverse plane , ignoring the longitudinal direction , i.e. , the direction parallel to the beam .",
    "the blast wave model was introduced in  @xcite to interpret the identified particle elliptic flow from star . in this model ,",
    "particles are emitted from a infinitely thin shell . to reproduce the pion source size measured , the model had to be extended to a filled cylinder .",
    "such a parametrisation had been used for several years to interpret transverse mass spectra  @xcite assuming a anzymuthally symetric system .    in this extended blast wave framework ,",

    "we find , when describing the system by an ellipse , that @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",

    "the expression was derived in @xcite where the following functions are used : @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the transverse rapidity boost that the particles feel at a given emission point .",
    "in order to describe non - azymuthally symetric systems , we have modified its original expression , to include its dependence on the azymuthal angle : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the `` elliptical radius '' .",
    "i.e. all points on an ellipse have a constant @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 means that there is a stronger boost in the reaction plane than out of it .",
    "since in an ellipse the radial vector and the vector normal to the surface of the ellipse are not aligned we introduce the variable @xmath27 . indeed , in the cooper frye prescription  @xcite that the blast wave model follows , the transverse boost that the particles acquire has to be normal to the freeze - out surface .",
    "+ - the third term of the equation accounts for the duration of particle emission using a single parameter @xmath28 .",
    "this term is particulary important when interpreting the pion source size .",
    "it has no effect , however , on the transverse mass spectra and elliptic flow .    in the azymuthally symetric case",

    "the system is now confined to a cylinder of radius r. there are four parameters : the temperature t , the magnitude of the flow transverse boost @xmath30 , the radius of the cylinder r , and the emission duration @xmath28 .",
    "the parameters that quantify the anisotropy of the system ( @xmath15 and @xmath31 ) vanish .    from the phase space density , @xmath32 , it is straightforward to calculate transverse mass spectra and source radii .",
    "both the pion source radii and the pion , kaon and proton transverse mass spectra are well reproduced with @xmath33 , @xmath34 mev , @xmath35 fm and @xmath36 1.5 fm / c .",
    "it is interesting to notice that to keep the ratio @xmath37 as a function of @xmath38 comparable with the values measured by star@xcite which are close or even below one , the emission duration must be on the order of 1 or 2 fm . indeed , since in the usual bertsch - pratt parameterization",
    ", @xmath39 is the radius component parallel to the transverse momentum of the pair ( @xmath40 ) while @xmath41 is normal to @xmath40 , the emission duration increases @xmath39 while leaving @xmath41 unchanged .",
    "such a short emission duration is not currently achieved by any realistic microscopic or hydrodynamic model .",
    "the parameters that best fit the identified particle elliptic flow measured by star  @xcite are @xmath42 , @xmath43 mev , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . the flow rapidity and temperature are consistent with the values obtained from transverse mass spectra and pion source size .",
    "the system is best described when both @xmath46 and @xmath47 differ from zero , i.e. when the system exhibit an asymmetry in momentum and space .",
    "the identified particle elliptic flow favours a system that is asymmetric both in space and momentum .",
    "the pion source should reflect such an asymmetry .",
    "it is thus interesting to study the pion source geometry as a function of the angle between the particle momenta and the reaction plane .",
    "such analysis was performed by the e895 collaboration  @xcite at the ags .",
    "the important difference between star and e895 is that directed flow ( @xmath48 ) can not yet be measured by star , which means that only the radii within the transverse plane are relevant .",
    "the available radii are @xmath39 , @xmath41 and the cross term @xmath49 . for the theoretical aspect of the analysis see  @xcite .",
    "events were selected using a minimum bias trigger which covers 85% of the whole centrality range .",
    "it is mandatory to include peripheral events where the elliptic flow is maximal .",
    "pion tracks are reconstructed and identified in the star tpc  @xcite in the momentum range : @xmath50 gev / c and @xmath51 .",
    "the reaction plane is reconstructed as described in  @xcite .",
    "pion pairs are sorted into four different bins depending on the angle between the pair momentum and the reaction plane .",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath41 and @xmath49 are extracted fitting the four different correlation functions constructed with each pair sample .",
    "figure  [ hbtflow ] shows the squared radii @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 as a function of the mean angle of the pairs with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "pion source radii as a function of the angle between the pair momenta and the reaction plane .",
    "triangle : data .",
    "solid line : blast wave model calculation . ]    a clear oscillation of the radii is observed .",
    "the line in the figure is a blast wave model calculation using the parameters @xmath33 , @xmath55 mev , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 fm , and @xmath36 2 fm / c .",
    "these parameters were chosen so that they are consistent with the ones extracted from identified particle elliptic flow and two - pion interferometry .",
    "a non zero value of the space asymmetry parameter @xmath47 is necessary to reproduce the data .",
    "when @xmath47 is equal to zero the momentum asymmetry expressed by @xmath59 is not sufficient to reproduce the oscillation of the radii .",
    "thus , since @xmath60 , this analysis indicates that the pion source geometry is an ellipse extended out of the reaction plane .",
    "the correlation of non - identical particles can be used to study the relative mean separation between the emission time and/or position of different particle species  @xcite .",
    "this technique is based on the comparison of two different correlation functions .",
    "if one assumes that kaons and pions are not emitted , on average , at the same time or position , for each pion - kaon pair there are two configurations : the pion and kaon get closer to each other or they move away from one another .",
    "the correlation between the two particles will be stronger in the first configuration than in the second one .",
    "it is shown in  @xcite that these two configurations correspond to @xmath61 either positive or negative ( @xmath62 is the velocity of the pair and @xmath63 is the momentum of either the kaon or the pion in the rest frame of the pair ) .",
    "two correlation functions can be constructed : @xmath64 for pairs with @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "if both correlation functions are not identical , it implies that there is a difference in the average space - time emission point of pions and kaons , or in other words , there is a space - time asymmetry in the emission process of pions and kaons .",
    "thus , to study whether or not pions and kaons are emitted at the same time we calculate the ratio @xmath68 as a function of @xmath69 .    in this analysis ,",
    "only the most central events are selected .",
    "they represent 12% of the total hadronic cross section .",
    "pions and kaons are identified by their specific energy loss in the star tpc .",
    "the acceptance of the pions is : @xmath50 gev / c and @xmath51 , and @xmath70 gev / c and @xmath51 for the kaons .",
    "electrons and positrons are carefully removed to avoid contamination of the @xmath71 , and @xmath72 pairs by @xmath73 pairs which are correlated in a non - trivial way .",
    "special care is taken to remove two - track merging effect since it noticeably influences the @xmath74 and @xmath75 correlation functions .",
    "the purity of the pion and kaon sample needs to be precisely known in order to estimate source size parameters from the correlation function . indeed misidentified particles , or secondary particles such as pions from @xmath76 decay lower the correlation strength . to first order",
    ", this effect is equivalent to increasing the source size which also lowers the average correlation strength .",
    "the purity analysis is still under way which prevents us from making any quantitative statement from this analysis .",
    "the correlation between the pions and kaons arises mainly from their coulomb attraction if they have opposite charge or repulsion if they have the same charge .",
    "the @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 correlation functions shown in figure  [ pikcf ] exhibit such a behaviour . a direct comparison to the blast wave model can not be performed because these correlation functions depend not only on the transverse source size but also on the longitudinal one , which is not accounted for in the blast wave framework .",
    "@xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 correlation functions ]    the blast wave predictions can however be compared to the ratio of correlation functions @xmath77 over @xmath78 shown in figure  [ pikratcf ] . indeed , the acceptance of each particle species is symmetric about mid - rapidity , which cancels out any effect that would be due to a difference in the emission position along the longitudinal direction . to improve the statistics ,",
    "we have combined the @xmath74 and @xmath75 correlation functions and the @xmath71 and @xmath72 correlation functions .",
    "the ratio @xmath68 is significantly different from unity for both like sign and unlike sign pairs which leads us to the conclusion that pions and kaons are not emitted at the same space or / and time .",
    "ratio of correlation functions @xmath68 ]    the extended blast wave model calculations compare well with the data .",
    "the calculation was done with @xmath33 , @xmath34 mev , @xmath35 fm , and @xmath79 fm / c .",
    "we showed in section ii that , with these parameters , the extended blast wave model describes well the transverse mass spectra and the pion source size .",
    "it is striking to notice that the extended blast wave model reproduces the data without the need of any extra parameters such as one representing the difference between the average emission time of pions and kaons .",
    "why does the blast wave model predict an asymmetry between the emission point of the pions and kaons ? to answer this question it is important to notice that at low @xmath5 , pions and kaons have the same velocity but not the same momentum . indeed , at low @xmath5 the pion average @xmath80 is equal to 0.1 gev / c while it is equal to 0.4 gev / c for the kaons . in the blast wave model ,",
    "if the temperature is equal to zero , particles are emitted at radii that depend only on their transverse velocity not on their mass . in this case , pions and kaons would be emitted at the same radii .",
    "however , switching on the temperature decreases the position - momentum correlation , which leaves the particles more freedom to fill the cylinder volume .",
    "thus , the thermal motion pulls the average emission radius away from the edge of the cylinder , towards the centre of the system .",
    "kaons , being less affected by the thermal motion due to their high mass compare to the temperature , are more likely to be emitted close to the edge of the cylinder than pions .",
    "in other words , on average , kaons are emitted further from the centre of the source than pions which is why the ratio @xmath68 calculated in the extended blast wave framework , shown on figure  [ pikratcf ] deviates from unity .",
    "the interplay between the temperature and transverse flow built in the blast wave model introduces an asymmetry in the emission of the pions and kaons that is in qualitative agreement with the data .",
    "the non - identical particle correlation function can be used to constrain the temperature and flow parameters of the extended blast wave model . however , at this stage , given the statistical and systematic uncertainties we only conclude that the blast wave model is in agreement with the data when using the same parameters that reproduce the transverse mass spectra and the pion source radii .",
    "we have shown two new analyses from the star experiment at rhic .",
    "the analysis of the pion source geometry with respect to the reaction plane led to the conclusion that the source is an ellipse extended out of plane .",
    "the study of the pion - kaon correlation functions allows us to state that @xmath81 gev / c pions and @xmath82 gev / c kaons are not emitted at the same position or / and time .",
    "we have interpreted our results in the framework of the extended blast wave model .",
    "we show that the pion source geometry , and the pion - kaon space - time emission asymmetry can be described by the same set of parameters which are also used to interpret the transverse mass spectra and the elliptic flow measured by star .",
    "the picture that emerges from this model is a system with a strong collective expansion that freezes out in a few fm / c .",
