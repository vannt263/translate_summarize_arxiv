    "lithium is a fragile element that serves as a powerful diagnostic of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "the fragility of li arises from the fact that it can burn at relatively low temperatures via the [ @xmath3li ( p,@xmath4 ) @xmath5he ] and [ @xmath0li ( p,@xmath4 ) @xmath6he ] processes .",
    "most of the li destruction occurs during the pre - main sequence state , when the convection zones are deepest and for stellar models with the lowest mass .",
    "lower mass stars arrive on the zams at lower temperatures and the amount of protostellar li that survives today in dwarf stars decreases with decreasing temperature @xcite .",
    "stellar clusters such as @xmath4 per and the pleiades , show a large spread of li abundances at each effective temperature and it has been shown that the largest li abundances are found in fast rotating stars with the strongest chromospheric emission @xcite .",
    "this is a puzzling result as theoretical models predict that fast rotation enhances the mixing process that leads to increased li depletion ; the rotational history plays a major role in the depletion process @xcite .    on the main sequence ,",
    "the correlation between li and chromospheric activity is not very strong .",
    "stars with the same ca ii flux may have li abundances that differ by one order of magnitude .",
    "lithium is enhanced in sunspots @xcite where a small but notable amount of @xmath0li has been detected @xcite .",
    "an investigation of active rs cvn binaries failed to show a clear correlation between photometric variations and li abundances @xcite .",
    "plages and active regions could play a minor role but their effect would be to decrease rather than increase the li 6707.8  equivalent width @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the li 6104  line , which is formed deeper into the atmosphere , to study a sample of pleiades k dwarfs .",
    "the results showed that the derived abundances have significantly less scatter than those derived from the 6707.8  line .",
    "if activity has an effect on li , it seems to increase rather than decrease the equivalent width and is therefore opposite to what the chromospheric nlte calculations predict .",
    "surface activity could increase the li abundance if extreme energetic conditions are met @xcite .",
    "spallation reactions from low energy flares can increase @xmath1 ratios @xcite .",
    "predictions for significant creation of @xmath0li in stellar and solar flares have been made @xcite although actual measurements for the sun have found the average @xmath1 of 0.01 and up to 0.04 @xcite .",
    "the first detection of @xmath0li on the halo dwarf hd 84937 has been highly significant @xcite . follow up studies have confirmed this detection and have also shown the presence of the isotope in bd+26@xmath7  3578 @xcite .",
    "unexpected @xmath0li abundances have been observed during a long flare on a chromospherically active binary @xcite .",
    "these have been attributed to spallation reactions .",
    "in this paper we present high resolution vlt uves observations of the k star gj  117 with emphasis on the li 6707.8   line profile .",
    "gj  117 ( = hd  17925 ) is a single chromospherically active k dwarf .",
    "the object shows evidence for photometric variability with a period of 6.5 days @xcite while the weak color variations show that the star is redder at minimum light .",
    "spectroscopic observations in the ca ii lines also show strong evidence for variability at both short and long timescales @xcite .",
    "our observations and analysis are presented in   2 . in   2.1 we present stellar models generated using the phoenix code for the temperature and gravity of gj  117 .",
    "we present the results , derived lithium parameters , and @xmath1 ratio in   2.2 .",
    "discussion of the results and implications for lithium production are presented in   2.3 , and",
    "lastly we summarize our findings in   3 .",
    "measurements of @xmath0li in stellar spectra are very difficult and rely on the modeling of the increased width and red asymmetry of the 6707.8  doublet .",
    "the problem becomes particularly difficult in active late - type stars where large rotational velocities will smear the line profiles .",
    "the problem is further complicated by the occurrence of blends , such as ti  i and cn . the observations were conducted in december 2002 with the vlt kueyen telescope and uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) .",
    "this set - up used the 600 l  mm@xmath8 red grating and mit / ll eev 2k@xmath94k ccd . with an exposure time of 150 seconds",
    "this setup provided a resolution of @xmath10110,000 and a signal - to - noise of @xmath10400 in the final spectrum .",
    "the vlt data were reduced with the vlt data pipeline ( uves/1.3.3 ) with further analysis carried out using the starlink based dipso software .",
    "the uves spectrum of gj  117 in the li  i 6708  region is shown in figure 1 .",
    "theoretical spectra were calculated using the general stellar atmosphere code phoenix @xcite .",
    "we have used the lte atmosphere models from the nextgen series of @xcite for the effective temperature and gravity listed in table  1 . given the uncertainties in t@xmath11 and log(@xmath12 ) ,",
    "typically @xmath13 200k and @xmath130.3 dex , we have used the directly converged models from nextgen which are sampled every 200k in t@xmath11 and 0.5dex in log(@xmath12 ) .",
    "line blanketing is handled within phoenix by means of direct opacity sampling @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0li resonance doublet has been included in phoenix by adding the wavelengths and @xmath14 values of @xcite into the master line list @xcite where the fraction of @xmath1 is introduced as a parameter(@xmath15 ) . in direct opacity sampling ,",
    "opacity at each wavelength point is calculated as a sum of opacities from all the contributing species .",
    "the contributions from @xmath3li and @xmath0li are then expressed as :    @xmath16    @xmath17    where @xmath18 ) is the opacity calculated as if all lithium is in the x isotopic state .",
    "theoretical line profiles have been calculated with @xmath15 ranging from 0.0 to 0.2 .",
    "microturbulence has been taken into account when generating the model spectra using a velocity of @xmath19=1.5 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath20sini of the object was derived from @xmath21 analysis of several lines in the li  i 6707.8  region .",
    "we have carried out a comparison between the observed and model profiles using @xmath21 statistics .",
    "a grid of models in steps of @xmath1 = 0.01 was developed and the most probable model with @xmath221 was determined .",
    "figure  2 shows the @xmath23 computed for the model grid and plotted with the sign preserved .",
    "the best fit has a @xmath1 = 0.030 @xmath13 0.007 and @xmath23  @xmath24  30 as compared to a model with no @xmath0li .",
    "the observed spectrum of gj  117 fitted with @xmath1 ratios of 0.0 , 0.03 and 0.10 is shown in figure  3 .",
    "@xmath25 was calculated for 35 degrees of freedom and a sign factor was added to @xmath25 to indicate whether the observational data was larger than ( positive ) or smaller than ( negative ) the model .    the @xmath1 ratio derived from the best fits are also given in table  1 .",
    "1@xmath26 errors for the table were derived using @xmath25 + 1 e.g. @xcite , and we also include a conservative 5% systematic error to account for the uncertainty in the continuum level making @xmath1 = 0.030@xmath130.010 .",
    "the influence of lines such as fe i , ti i , and cn on the li i profile , can potentially mimic an enhanced @xmath0li abundance @xcite .",
    "the effects of possible cn bands near 6707.5 have been seen to be @xmath27 1 m  in the solar spectrum and should have a negligible effect for gj  117 . in earlier lower resolution data",
    "the fe i line at 6707.4 was often blended with li i , however in the uves observations these are easily separable .",
    "we have tested models with enhanced fe abundances and found that these have no effect on the li i line profile .",
    "the most significant blend may come from the ti i lines in the vicinity of 6708  and could lead to erroneous results .",
    "@xcite have claimed the detection of @xmath1 = 0.12 in the planet hosting star hd82943 .",
    "@xcite concluded that this enhanced @xmath0li could be explained by the presence of a ti i lines near 6708.03 and 6708.1  . in a follow up paper @xcite revised the ratio to @xmath1 = 0.05@xmath130.02 .",
    "the phoenix models used in our analysis were updated to include the atomic data for ti  i lines taken from table  3 of @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the effects of ti i on the li line profile by constructing a grid of models with ti abundances ranging from log(ti ) 4.0 to 6.0 and fitting the ti i line at 6716.6 .",
    "the best @xmath25 revealed an abundance of log(ti ) = 5.22 in excellent agreement with the result of @xcite .",
    "the latter value was used in the determination of the @xmath1 ratio .",
    "the effects of ti abundance were investigated further by constructing an additional set of models at a given ti abundance with @xmath1 ranging from 0.0 to 0.1 .",
    "the best fit to the li line profile provided a @xmath1 ratio at each ti abundance .",
    "the results are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the ti abundance and @xmath1 ratio are anti - correlated ( also see @xcite ) in the sense that for a given li profile , a lower ti abundance would lead to an increased @xmath1 ratio . however , in the case of gj 117 studied here , in order to drive the @xmath1 ratio to zero , a ti abundance of five times greater ( log(ti ) = 5.92 ) would be required .",
    "we emphasize that both our results and those found in the literature are consistent with log(ti ) = 5.22",
    ".    an additional check on any significant blending that may contaminate the red wing of the lithium profile was done by comparing the spectrum of gj 117 to the template star hd  131511 which has a similar spectral type .",
    "the two objects have similar metallicity ( fe / h = 0.13 to fe / h = 0.15 ) @xcite but hd  131511 has no detectable lithium @xcite .",
    "hd 131511 was observed at the mcdonald 2.7 m on 2005 may 24 with a resolution of @xmath10130,000 and a signal - to - noise just over 120 .",
    "the spectra of the two objects are compared in fig 5 .",
    "features in the 6707.8 to 6708.3   region were examined on the hd  131511 spectrum and showed an equivalent width of less than 2 m .",
    "we therefore conclude that our estimate of @xmath1 on gj 117 is not effected significantly by other lines .",
    "we have also analysed the bisectors of 4 nearby spectral lines of fe  i and ca  i on gj  117 and found them to be vertical with an uncertainty of about 0.004    ( 0.2 km / s ) .",
    "the red asymmetry in the li profile is therefore not caused by the atmospheric effects of granulation .",
    "our findings are consistent with @xcite who analyse the shape of the bisector of the k2v star @xmath28 eri , a star with atmospheric properties similar to our object .",
    "our findings are also consistent with @xcite .",
    "the lack of asymmetries can be explained by the fact that in active stars , like gj  117 , strong magnetic fields inhibit convection which is known to be the case in sunspots .",
    "@xcite have suggested that flare activity may account for @xmath0li production on hd 84937 .",
    "however , @xcite have questioned the feasibility of this scenario on the basis of the energetics involved .",
    "we will now examine if the activity of gj  117 can account for the detected @xmath0li on this source . as already mentioned in the introduction gj  117",
    "has shown evidence for chromospheric activity . with a rotational velocity of 5.5 km s@xmath8",
    "gj  117 is rotating faster than the sun and has a deeper convection zone .",
    "its x - ray luminosity is at least one order of magnitude higher than the x - ray luminosity of the sun at solar maximum @xcite .",
    "its x - ray emission implies a total average flare energy of @xmath10 5  @xmath9  10@xmath29  ergs  s@xmath8 and a corresponding total average u - band flare energy of @xmath10  5  @xmath9  10@xmath30  ergs  s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the most energetic solar flares are the x - class with energies of at least 10@xmath31  ergs .",
    "the goes database shows that in 2000 , a solar maximum year , 17 x - class flares were observed . assuming that these values also hold for gj  117 they imply a total energy of e@xmath32  ergs over 1 gyr . with a production efficiency of 10@xmath33 atoms",
    "ergs@xmath8 we have 5@xmath34  atoms @xcite .",
    "the mass of the convection zone of gj  117 is 0.06 m@xmath35 @xcite . with an estimated log(li )",
    "= 2.45 and @xmath1 = 0.03 we obtain @xmath10 5@xmath910@xmath36 atoms . in the largest solar flares the number of protons with energy over 30",
    "mev is more than 10@xmath37 .",
    "this value implies a 3@xmath910@xmath29 @xmath3li atoms s@xmath8 @xcite and 7@xmath910@xmath30 @xmath0li atoms s@xmath8 @xcite or 2.2@xmath910@xmath38 @xmath0li atoms in 1 gyr .",
    "our estimates are therefore consistent with the @xmath0li generation by spallation processes in flare events .",
    "high resolution vlt uves observations of the dk1 star gj  117 show the detection of @xmath0li at the 3% level ( @xmath1 = 0.030@xmath2 ) .",
    "our spectral analysis included the ti i transitions and atomic data used by @xcite for similar studies of the planet hosting star hd  82493 .",
    "gj  117 is considerably more active than the sun .",
    "we have examined the possibility of li production by spallation in stellar flares and concluded that the energetics involved are sufficient for this process to take place .",
    "future work on this subject could include the study of the li profile during flare events where an enhanced @xmath0li may be expected .",
