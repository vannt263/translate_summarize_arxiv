    "the accretion of phantom dark energy onto a static schwarzschild black hole was first formulated by babichev et al @xcite using michel s process and established that static schwarzschild black hole mass will gradually decrease to zero near the big rip singularity .",

    "<S> in this work , we have studied accretion of the dark matter and dark energy onto of @xmath0-dimensional schwarzschild black hole and morris - thorne wormhole . the mass and the rate of change of mass for @xmath0-dimensional schwarzschild black hole and morris - thorne wormhole have been found . </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed some candidates of dark energy like holographic dark energy , new agegraphic dark energy , quintessence , tachyon , dbi - essence , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the black hole mass and the wormhole mass have been calculated in term of redshift when dark matter and above types of dark energies accrete onto them separately . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the black hole mass increases and wormhole mass decreases for holographic dark energy , new agegraphic dark energy , quintessence , tachyon accretion and the slope of increasing / decreasing of mass sensitively depends on the dimension . </S>",
    "<S> but for dbi - essence accretion , the black hole mass first increases and then decreases and the wormhole mass first decreases and then increases and the slope of increasing / decreasing of mass not sensitively depends on the dimension . </S>"
