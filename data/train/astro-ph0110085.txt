    "the resolution into individual sources of the majority of the optical , submm and x - ray backgrounds ( madau & pozzetti 2000 ; blain et al.1999 ; brandt et al .  2001 ) means that we can now investigate the relationship and balance between obscured and unobscured star formation and agn activity at high redshifts .",
    "for example , the limited overlap between x - ray and submm populations has been taken as evidence that the bulk of the submm background arises from reprocessed starlight ( fabian et al .",
    "2000 ; barger et al .  2001 ; almaini et al.2001 ) . while the broad equality between the intensity of the optical and far - ir background radiation has then been used to argue that comparable amounts of star formation occur in obscured and unobscured environments ( hauser et al .",
    "a major unresolved issue is the relationship between the obscured and unobscured modes of star formation , as represented by scuba - selected galaxies and lyman - break galaxies , respectively ( smail , ivison , & blain 1997 ; steidel , pettini , & hamilton 1995 ) . is unobscured activity simply the tip of the iceberg , and can it be used to predict the obscured component ( adelberger & steidel 2000 ) , or do lyman - break galaxies represent a physically distinct population with no meaningful relationship with galaxies selected in the submm ( van der werf et al .  2001 ; meurer et al .  2001 ; also see bell et al .",
    "this has important implications for the relative contributions of optical- and submm - selected galaxies to the history of star formation ( blain et al .",
    "1999b ; chapman et al .",
    "2000 ; peacock et al .  2001 ) .    to address this issue we need to study the properties of individual submm galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , progress has been constrained by their faintness in the rest - frame uv and the resultant dearth of spectroscopic redshifts and detailed morphologies for more than a handful of systems ( ivison et al .",
    "1998 , 2000a  i00 ) . for the moment",
    "all we have to work with are a few , perhaps atypical , optically - bright galaxies with precise redshifts .",
    "there are also concerns about the over - representation of agn in the current samples of spectroscopically - identified submm galaxies , reflecting a bias from the relative ease of measuring redshifts for their strong - lined spectra .",
    "although star formation , rather than the agn , is thought to dominate the energetics of these systems , the presence of an agn clearly complicates any detailed analysis .",
    "we are therefore left with only a single example from current surveys of the class of galaxy which is expected to comprise the majority of the submm population : the @xmath0 , gas - rich , luminous starburst , smmj14011 + 0252 ( i00 ) , although even this appears unusually bright in the rest - frame uv .",
    "smmj14011 + 0252 , lying behind the core of the @xmath6 cluster a1835 , has an 850-@xmath7 m flux of 6mjy , after correcting for amplification by the foreground cluster lens ( a mean factor of @xmath8 , dominated by amplification along position angle 9@xmath9 ) , showing that this is an ultraluminous ir galaxy ( ulirg ) with a far - ir luminosity of @xmath10l@xmath11 , a star - formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath12m@xmath11yr@xmath13 and a large dust mass , @xmath14@xmath15m@xmath16 .",
    "i00 present detailed observations of this submm - selected source , which they identified with an interacting / merging pair of galaxies , j1 and j2 , separated by @xmath17 , with a combined absolute magnitude of @xmath18 and @xmath19kms@xmath13mpc@xmath13 , giving a scale of @xmath20kpc at @xmath0 .",
    "we quote all magnitudes and linear scales as observed , rather than corrected for lens amplification , unless otherwise stated . ] .",
    "j2 contributes the bulk of the luminosity in the uv , with the redder j1 dominating the near - ir .",
    "optical and near - ir spectra of j1 and j2 show no hint of agn characteristics ( i00 ) and the system is undetected in hard x - ray observations with _",
    "( fabian et al .",
    "2000 ) , supporting the contention that its luminosity is predominantly produced by an intense starburst .",
    "the accurate redshift for this system allowed frayer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to detect co(3@xmath212 ) emission , confirming the presence of a large gas reservoir , @xmath22m@xmath11 ( probably a lower limit based on evidence of cold gas from co(1@xmath210 ) emission in another source , papadopoulos et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "although the observational dataset on smmj14011 + 0252 is the most comprehensive available for any submm galaxy , there is still considerable freedom in interpreting the results .",
    "in particular , we need to identify the location of the intense far - ir emission within the system , and the attendant gas reservoir , to understand the exact relationship between the uv and far - ir emission ( adelberger & steidel 2000 ) and determine if they are coming from physically disjoint components .",
    "unfortunately , the published observations had insufficient spatial resolution to answer this question",
    ". we have therefore undertaken a campaign to image smmj14011 + 0252 at high resolution in the radio , millimeter ( co ) and optical / near - ir wavebands to investigate in detail the distribution of obscured and unobscured star formation in this galaxy .",
    "we describe our new high - resolution images in  2 , analyse these in  3 and present our conclusions in  4 .",
    "the _ hst _ imaging of smmj14011 + 0252 , in the field of a1835 , comprises three orbits in the f702w filter , giving a combined integration time of 7.5ks .",
    "we adopt the vega - based _",
    "wfpc2 _ photometric system , @xmath23 , from holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . the final wfpc2 frame ( see fig",
    ".  1 ) has an effective resolution of 0.15@xmath3 and a 3-@xmath24 detection limit within a 2@xmath3diameter photometry aperture of @xmath25 .",
    "we also exploit new , near - ir imaging of smmj14011 + 0252 . using ufti on the ukirt , smith et al .",

    "the initial owens valley millimeter array ( ovro ) co observations taken of j1/j2 in 1998 showed evidence for a possible extended component in the north - south direction ( frayer et al .  1999 ) .",
    "we subsequently obtained 78hr of high - resolution co observations at ovro and the berkeley - illinois - maryland array ( bima ) to constrain the co morphology and position of the source ( table  1 ) .",

    "we achieved an rms noise level 0.8mjybeam@xmath13 integrated over the co emission - line width of 320kms@xmath13 , with a beam of @xmath35 .",
    "the a1835 field was also mapped with the national radio astronomy observatory s ( nrao ) very large array ( vla ) , during 1998 april and 2000 november .",
    "after standard calibration and editing of the data and their associated weights using aips , the wide - field imaging task , imagr , was used to map the central @xmath36 field ( see , e.g.richards 2000 ) .",
    "the resulting map ( fig  2b ) has a noise level of 12@xmath7jybeam@xmath13 with 1.45@xmath3 resolution .      to reliably compare the positions of the components of smmj14011 + 0252 we have revisited the astrometry from i00 to tie the optical and near - ir images directly to the radio coordinate frame . by identifying bright radio sources within the _ hst _ field",
    "we align the frames to a precision of @xmath20.3@xmath3 .",
    "we then measure the position of j1 to be @xmath37 52@xmath38 24.@xmath390 @xmath40 0.3@xmath3 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the peak of the 1.4-ghz radio source lies at @xmath41 52@xmath38 24.@xmath398 ( j2000 ) , with an uncertainty of @xmath42 , coincident with the co emission which peaks at @xmath43 52@xmath38 25.@xmath390 ( j2000 ) , with an uncertainty of @xmath44 .",
    "the _ hst _ imaging of smmj14011 + 0252 , aided by the gravitational amplification from a1835 , provides a sub - kpc scale view of the components of this submm source in the rest - frame uv , @xmath45 .",
    "this shows that j1 is well resolved , with a half - light diameter of @xmath46 ( @xmath47kpc in the source plane ) . as with another submm galaxy , lockman 850.1 ( lutz et al.2001 ) ,",
    "its morphology is complex : the main component appears to be relatively regular , with an extended envelope . superimposed on this",
    "are several bright knots , in two groups : one to the south - east and the other to the north ( which also appears in @xmath5 ) .",
    "the northern group points towards another bright , resolved blue knot , @xmath48 away .",
    "this knot defines the outer limit of a low - surface - brightness extension , j1n , to the north of j1 , which has an extent of 10kpc in the source plane and which is much more prominent in @xmath5 than @xmath49 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we note , as did ivison et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , that red plumes such as this may be due to line emission : probably h@xmath50 at 2.34@xmath7 m ( i00 ) , which could be mapped in the future using near - ir integral - field spectroscopy .",
    "the second bright component , j2 , is more luminous than j1 at rest - frame wavelengths of @xmath51 , but rapidly becomes fainter in redder wavebands .",
    "j2 has a compact appearance , with a half - light diameter of @xmath52 .",
    "the morphology of j2 suggests it could be an edge - on disk extending out to @xmath53 , with a high - surface - brightness nucleus , though the prominence of this extension may result from the higher north - south amplification .",
    "photometry from the seeing - matched f702w and @xmath5-band frames gives : j1 , @xmath54 and j2 , @xmath55 , both in apertures twice the size of their respective half - light diameters .",
    "j1n is much redder than either of the bright components with @xmath56 , very similar to the extreme colors seen in other submm galaxiesm source in the same field as smmj14011 + 0252 .",
    "it has a very faint near - ir counterpart ( j5 ) which was , and remains , undetected at optical wavelengths .",
    "we can now place a 3@xmath24 limit on its color of @xmath57 in a @xmath58-diameter aperture , meaning that this galaxy is an ero or a class  0/i submm source ( ivison et al.2000b ) .",
    "this brings the fraction of eros in the smail et al .",
    "sample to @xmath5927 per cent ( @xmath5944 per cent for the 4@xmath24 sample ) . ] ( smail et al .  1999 ) .    as shown in fig .  2 ,",
    "the peaks of the co and radio emission in our high - resolution maps lie @xmath21@xmath3 north of j1 and @xmath22@xmath3 east of j2 .",
    "given the precision of our astrometry , these offsets are significant and so we can rule out the starburst arising from either of these components .",
    "the radio / co emission are not coincident with the ero , j1n , but are more consistent with this component than with any other .",
    "thus the bulk of the luminosity , gas and dust appear be located close to , or within , the extremely red component .",
    "i00 estimated the sfr for @xmath60m@xmath16 stars in smmj14011 + 0252 , based on far - ir and radio fluxes , of @xmath12m@xmath16yr@xmath13 .",
    "in contrast , the h@xmath50 luminosity indicates only @xmath61m@xmath16yr@xmath13 .",
    "they concluded that the likely cause of this discrepency is significant dust extinction , extending to rest - frame @xmath26600(observed @xmath5-band ) , which obscures the most vigorously star forming regions within the galaxy .",
    "this is consistent with the faint appearance of the star - forming region in our @xmath5-band image and its complete absence in the _ hst _ frame , as well as the conclusions of studies which constrast the very different appearance of local starbursts in the optical and the near - ir / radio .",
    "we suggest that the known optical components , j1/j2 , merely represent foreground star - forming knots , or windows through the dust in a large and otherwise opaque star - forming complex .",
    "since the starburst is obscured even at @xmath5 , we must turn to our long-@xmath62 observations to investigate its morphology .",
    "the distributions of both the radio and co emission are extended roughly north  south , consistent with alignment of j1j1n , with the emission resolved along this axis .",
    "after deconvolving the beam , the molecular gas traced by co subtends @xmath63 along the major axis ( fig .",
    "2a ) . assuming conservatively that the amplification is entirely north - south , the molecular gas must cover at least 20kpc .",
    "the best gaussian fit to the 1.4-ghz emission gives @xmath64 ( fwhm ) , although a fainter emission extends to the south ( fig .",
    "we stress that several nearby radio sources remain unresolved in our map , so this extension is real .",
    "this strongly suggests that the far - ir emission is powered by a starburst : the vast molecular gas reservoir appears to be converted into stars and ultimately into sne on a galaxy - wide scale .",
    "the growing evidence of highly extended starbursts in the submm galaxy population ( ivison et al .",
    ", in prep ) indicates that physical conditions ( gas densities , dust shielding , wind formation ) in these systems will be very different from those expected on the basis of local , compact ( @xmath65kpc ) ulirgs .",
    "we have presented new high - resolution optical , co and radio observations of the @xmath0 scuba - selected ulirg , smmj14011 + 0252 .",
    "our new @xmath5-band imaging has allowed us to resolve an ero component within this system ( @xmath66 ) . of the known optical / near - ir components ,",
    "this heavily dust - obscured component is closest to the starburst , as probed by our high - resolution co and radio maps .",
    "these observations are relevant for the issue of the relationship between the lyman - break and submm galaxy populations . in this paper",
    "we have studied a galaxy which has been claimed to represent the transition between these two populations , with uv properties that confirm the reliability of large extinction corrections of the type applied to lyman - break galaxies ( adelberger & steidel 2000 ) .",
    "our higher resolution data have demonstrated that the properties of smmj14011 + 0252 are much more complex than previously thought , with the bulk of the luminosity coming from an extremely red component which is not seen in rest - frame uv observations , or possibly from a region which is blank even in the near - ir .",
    "while the optically bright components , j1 and j2 , are clearly associated with the submm source , they appear as distinct regions within the system and their rest - frame uv properties are therefore unlikely to provide a reliable indication of the physical processes occuring within the highly obscured starburst .",
    "j1 , j2 and even j1n may merely mark windows through the dust in an otherwise opaque star - forming complex .",
    "this calls into question the validity of using uv - selected objects to trace the evolution of obscured star formation at high redshifts .",
    "nevertheless , in the absence of the less obscured components , j1 and j2 , this system would have been difficult to study in the detail achieved here .",
    "the presence of uv - bright companions may prove to be the only practical way to measure redshifts for submm galaxies for the foreseeable future ( see the discussion of j5 in i00 ; cf .",
    "blain et al .  2000 ; townsend et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "new information on the luminous submm source , smmj14009 + 0252 , previously suggested as a radio - loud agn with ero characteristics , confirm that this galaxy is an ero , raising the fraction of known extremely red counterparts to almost half of the most robust parent sample .",
    "high - redshift dusty galaxies such as smmj14011 + 0252 and smmj14009 + 0252 account for @xmath67 per cent of the submm background ( blain et al .",
    "1999 ) , leaving room for only a modest contribution from the submm counterparts of uv - selected systems ( peacock et al.2000 ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the situation in the local universe , where very luminous dusty starbursts contribute a minor fraction of the total energy output , underlining the rapid evolution which must occur in the ulirg population ( smail et al .",
    "1997 ) . identifying the physical process responsible for this rapid increase in star formation , as well as the reason for the much larger physical scale of high - redshift starbursts compared to local examples , will yield important insights into the formation of massive galaxies .",
