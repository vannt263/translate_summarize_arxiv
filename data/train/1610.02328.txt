    "these observations are consistent with a previous report of a residual polarization in both the 4sl and the 5sl phase @xcite .    a strong memory effect was also observed for sequential pulsed - field measurements , as shown in fig .",

    "first , @xmath51 was measured for a pulse with @xmath31 = , giving a @xmath51 of . in all subsequent measurements ,",
    "a bias of + was applied . during a transition from a non - ferroelectric to a ferroelectric phase with an applied bias ,",
    "it is energetically favorable for @xmath51 to align with @xmath31 and form a ferroelectric monodomain ; therefore upon switching @xmath31 one would expect the direction of @xmath51 to switch also .",
    "in fact , upon a reverse in @xmath31 a polarization of was observed , and with each subsequent measurement @xmath51 gradually increased in the direction of @xmath31 , until the magnitude of @xmath51 started to saturate at .",
    "a large , but not fully reversed , @xmath51 of was only recovered once an pulse was applied to drive the system into the 5sl phase . in another set of measurements with @xmath52 = and @xmath21-field pulses (",
    "not shown ) , it was found that two @xmath21-field pulses were needed before the direction of @xmath51 was reversed .",
    "this indicates that a memory of the polarization state is retained in both the 4sl and the 5sl phases , but that the memory appears to be stronger in the 4sl ground state .",
    "the changing magnitude of @xmath51 between subsequent measurements indicates that the population ratio of the two types of ferroelectric domains is gradually changed by each @xmath21-field pulse , as opposed to the complete switching from one domain type to another that would be expected .",
    "although the results reported here are broadly consistent with the literature , we wish to highlight a number of aspects that either have not been previously reported or have not been emphasised in the past .",
    "first , we note that the residual polarization at @xmath21 = follows the direction of the _ bias _ rather than the sign of the high - field ferroelectric polarization , and , for example , is similar for all pulses collected at @xmath31 = in spite of the fact that both the absolute values and the sign of the high - field ferroelectric polarization vary greatly between pulses .",
    "this strongly suggests that the residual polarization is due to a spurious current caused by the applied bias which gives a net non - zero charge when integrated over the whole pulse , rather than a physical ferroelectric polarization .",
    "this current is likely to be greater through the transitions , but it is impossible to determine exactly because of hysteresis .",
    "we discuss this further in light of our measurements in persistent magnetic fields . secondly , although history dependences of the polarization in cufeo@xmath0 and memory effects in the ga doped compound have been reported previously , this is , to the best of our knowledge , the first observation that the high - field polarization can be _ opposite _ to the bias field .",
    "this fact , together with the previous observation of significant leakage currents in biased measurements , rules out the possibility that the memory effect may be due to charge trapping either at the magnetoelastic domain boundaries @xcite , at the mosaic crystallite boundaries ( as observed by x - ray diffraction ) , or at the electrodes , since any trapped charges would be removed by the reversed bias ( later , we show that the memory effect also exists in single-@xmath28-domain samples ) .",
    "another explanation for the memory effect is a small amount of phase coexistence of the feic phase in the 4sl and 5sl phases .",
    "similar memory effects have been observed in other multiferroics such as cuo @xcite and mnwo@xmath53 @xcite . in these cases , a memory of the polarity of an incommensurate multiferroic phase",
    "is retained in a collinear antiferromagnetic phase , which was attributed to multiferroic nanoregions .",
    "such residual feic regions would act as nucleation centers upon reentering the feic phase and could therefore act to favor a magnetic structure of one handedness ( and hence polarity ) over the other .",
    "we discuss this scenario in the remainder of the paper .",

    "( b ) a significant polarization increase is seen under applied stress compared to the unstrained sample , and the polarization magnitude starts to saturate at lower @xmath31 .",
    "this increase and @xmath31-field dependence is well explained by the formation of a single monoclinic @xmath28 domain , which increases the average @xmath31 experienced by the ferroelectric domains and causes a greater component of @xmath19 along [ 110 ] by removing symmetry - equivalent domains ( see text ) .",

    "however the polarization memory is drastically reduced when the thermal cycle goes to and exits the ground magnetic state , and a thermal cycle to completely removes the memory effect , showing a strong correlation between the magnetic state and the memory effect .",
    "( d ) pyrocurrents measured upon warming during the thermal cycle ( each offset by ) showed no evidence of any depolarization at the magnetic phase boundaries or thermally stimulated currents .",

    "a strong poling - field dependence is observed , with a high rate of change of @xmath19 at low @xmath31 fields and saturation of @xmath19 starting to occur only for @xmath31 fields above .",
    "such a poling field dependence implies that at low @xmath31 fields there is a significant energy barrier for motion of the magnetic / ferroelectric domain walls that prevents the formation of a ferroelectric monodomain @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the ferroelectric phase does show complete reversibility with the poling @xmath31-field direction when the system is warmed into the paramagnetic phase between subsequent measurements , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bias](c ) .",
    "therefore there is no intrinsic coupling with @xmath21 that favors one ferroelectric domain type over the other , and no memory of the polarization direction after warming into the paramagnetic phase , as expected .",
    "having established absolute values of @xmath19 at @xmath57 = , @xmath21 = through the pyrocurrent measurements [ fig .",
    "[ fig : bias](a ) ] , we were then able to investigate whether there is any physical residual polarization in the 4sl phase through magnetocurrent measurements . figure  [ fig : bias](d ) shows the result of magnetocurrent measurements upon reducing @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath19 was found to reduce precisely to zero within error at the magnetic phase transition at , giving no indication of a residual ferroelectric polarization .",
    "furthermore , no depolarization of the 4sl phase was observed upon warming for @xmath21=. therefore one can effectively ascribe the residual polarization observed in pulsed - field measurements to an artifact due to the applied bias , which must be applied throughout the measurement due to the short timewidth of the pulse .",
    "one implication of this finding is that the crystal structure in the 4sl should be described by a nonpolar space group such as @xmath58 , rather than , for example , by @xmath59 .",
    "another implication is that the volume of residual feic regions within the 4sl phase , which has been proposed as a possible explanation of multiferroic memory effects , must be extremely small , or we would detect a pyroelectric current upon warming into the paramagnetic phase at @xmath21 = .",

    "finally , the effect of warming was investigated [ see fig  [ fig : memory](e ) ] . having poled the sample while cooling at and then reduced the field to , a thermal cycle from 5 to 12 to was performed .",
    "then , upon reentering the ferroelectric phase , the polarization was found to be only 11% of its initial value ( red curves ) , indicating that the polarization memory had been almost but not completely removed in the sdw phase .",
    "it has been previously proposed that the memory effect in cufeo@xmath0 may be associated with the presence of magnetoelastic @xmath28 domains , which appear upon threefold symmetry breaking at @xmath6 , possibly through charging of the domain boundaries @xcite . in order to investigate this",

    "_ @xcite found that the application of of uniaxial pressure on a [ 1@xmath40 ] surface producted a volume fraction of 0.973 of the ( 110 ) domain and it is known that the magnetic ground state is stable up to pressures above @xcite .",
    "therefore we expect to form almost a complete magnetic monodomain upon cooling through @xmath6 , while maintaining the feic phase in applied magnetic fields .",

    "in fact , @xmath64 is even higher , with a value of at and still increasing with @xmath31 .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that , for a given poling @xmath31 field , in the unstrained sample the component of @xmath31 along the direction of @xmath19 is reduced in the ( 1@xmath430 ) and ( @xmath4310 ) directions , reducing the net @xmath19 within these domains , whereas the strained sample sees the full poling field in the @xmath65 $ ] direction .",
    "our polarization measurements confirm that we have an essentially monodomain sample below @xmath6 .",
    "the additional increase in @xmath19 above the predicted factor of 1.5 could also be due in part to a strain enhancement of polarization , as seen in cufe@xmath29ga@xmath54o@xmath55 @xcite , where the application of @xmath38 caused a further increase in @xmath19 of @xmath38 10% .    to determine whether or not the memory effect is associated with charging at @xmath28-domain boundaries as suggested in previous studies , we investigated the correlation of the polarization memory with the magnetothermal history of the strained ( monodomain ) sample . figure  [ fig : strainmemory ] shows the results of polarization measurements under uniaxial stress .",

    "iv for the possible role of _ magnetic _ domain walls ) .",
    "on the basis of the set of measurements presented in this paper , we can conclude that the previously observed residual polarization at @xmath21 = is an artifact , whereas we observe a very robust ferroelectric memory effect , which is not strongly dependent on the structural domain composition of the crystal .",

    "as previously discussed , it appears that charged domain boundaries are not likely to account for the observed memory effect .",
    "the enhanced polarization under strain suggests that the crystal has almost completely formed one monoclinic @xmath28 domain , and for @xmath31 = under stress the ferroelectric domain population is expected to be close to 100% in the direction of @xmath31 .",
    "most importantly , the polarization memory appears to be largely unchanged by the application of strain , with @xmath71 polarization memory in both cases .",
    "the fact that the polarization memory fraction is very similar in both the unstrained and the strained sample , even when the initial polarization state is significantly different ( 185 and respectively ) suggests that the ground state is , to a good extent , preserving the balance of helical domains in the poled feic phase . additionally , the dependence on the magnetic history in fig .",
    "[ fig : strainmemory ] , especially the fact that the polarization memory is drastically reduced in the sdw phase at 12 k and @xmath21 = , implies that the memory is strongly correlated with the magnetic configuration in the 4sl phase .",
    "an explanation of the memory effect that is consistent with our data is related to the possibility of the 4sl and 5sl phases themselves retaining a non - bulk helicity through bloch - type magnetic domain walls . upon reentering the feic phase without bias or poling",
    ", these domain walls would act as nucleation centers for the feic phase , producing a feic phase with a similar helicity configuration .",
    "we further investigated this scenario by calculating the minimum energy classical spin configurations for different phase - slip domain walls in the 4sl phase using a monte carlo method .",
    "a three - dimensional spin hamiltonian determined in a previous study by nakajima _ et al . _",
    "@xcite was used , including in - plane next - nearest neighbour exchange interactions and axis anisotropies .",
    "given that the ground state consists of four sublattices of spins , magnetic domain walls will occur with phase differences of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , depending on where each domain nucleates on the lattice . as the bond ordering is a direct response to the magnetic ordering , phase differences of @xmath72 and @xmath74 imply a break in the bond order , whereas @xmath73 domains imply that the bond order of a single - phase domain is maintained .",
    "therefore for a @xmath73 phase boundary we consider spins on a lattice as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4slwalls](a ) , whereas for @xmath72 and @xmath74 phase boundaries we introduce a structural domain boundary as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4slwalls](b ) .",
    "the two structural domains on either side of the boundary are the antiphase domains that would be formed due to loss of @xmath18 centering upon cooling through @xmath13 .",
    "these were not considered in our previous discussion but do not change the overall conclusions , since this type of domain wall does not produce any discontinuity in either the lattice or the atomic arrangement and can not therefore accommodate additional charge .    in the simulations ,",
    "the outermost spins were fixed to give the desired phase differences and the central @xmath75 spins were relaxed from a random initial orientation , with periodicity assumed in the [ 1@xmath40 ] direction .",
    "the classical minimum energy configurations for the three domain wall types are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4slwalls](c ) . for @xmath73 domains ,",
    "the energy cost was found to be lowest for @xmath76 , with a total domain wall cost of .",
    "the spins were found to form a helix in the plane perpendicular to the monoclinic @xmath44 axis with @xmath77 , which closely resembles the spin structure of the ferroelectric phase . for @xmath72 and @xmath74 domain walls , the lowest energy spin configurations consisted of one row of spins forming a helix , with the other row ordering antiferromagnetically , with some canting away from the @xmath20 axis .",
    "the total energy costs were 1.55 and for the @xmath72 and @xmath74 domain walls .",
    "importantly , all three domain wall types have a _ definite helicity _",
    ", with an equal energy cost for structures with opposite helicities for a given phase boundary .",
    "this analysis enables us to propose the following scenario : during the phase transition from the feic to the 4sl phase , as domains of the 4sl phase nucleate and grow , the domain walls formed between them will maintain the helicity of the ferroelectric phase .",
    "the energy cost of these walls is low compared to the thermal energy ; @xmath78 per spin is at compared to the average energy cost per spin in the domain wall of , and so this should not significantly hinder the formation of magnetic domains .",
    "by contrast , upon initially cooling in zero @xmath21 and @xmath31 field , there should exist an equal proportion of left- and right- handed domain walls , which could hinder the formation of a helical monodomain upon application of the @xmath21 field , as seen here as well as in previous studies @xcite .",
    "we remark that this concept is reminiscent to the nano - regions suggested for similar memory effects in cuo @xcite and mnwo@xmath53 @xcite .",
    "however , in this case the helical domain walls minimize the spin - configuration energy in the presence of antiferromagnetic domains of a _ single _ magnetic phase , as opposed to being small metastable regions of the feic phase embedded within collinear order .",
    "we now briefly discuss some implications of the helical - domain - wall model for the interpretation of our data .",
    "the presence of helical domain walls naturally explains why the memory is not particularly sensitive to a reversing bias , as these domain walls do not give rise to a bulk polarization and have a high energy barrier to flip the handedness of rotation .",
    "however , upon warming at into the sdw phase , the domain structure would be severely rearranged , thus explaining the large reduction in memory for @xmath66 = .",
    "the fact that there is still a small memory for @xmath66 = may be due to phase coexistence of the 4sl and sdw phases , as no memory was observed for warming into the sdw phase at .",
    "furthermore , at the feic-5sl phase transition there is a change in bond ordering from the scalene - triangle order to a bond - ordered superlattice with @xmath182/@xmath79 symmetry @xcite , as opposed to the 4sl - feic phase transition , where the bond ordering is maintained across the transition .",
    "therefore a complete description of the magnetic bond ordering throughout the domain boundaries of the 5sl phase can not readily be determined , preventing the extension of our calculations to the 5sl phase - domain structures .",
    "our experimental results reveal a weaker memory effect in the 5sl phase , which suggests that only some domain walls in the 5sl phase contain helical spin structures .",
    "helical domain walls with the same magnetic structure as the polar feic phase would also be expected to be polar , with the same dipole moment per unit cell .",
    "however , the domain walls are not expected to give a macroscopically measurable polarization , as the measured compensating charge at the sample contacts is dependent on the volume fraction of the domain walls relative to the sample volume , which is expected to be negligible .    in summary , we have shown that a strong polarization memory exists in the nonpolar magnetic ground state of cufeo@xmath0 following electrical biasing of the ferroelectric phase at @xmath80 @xmath21 @xmath80 , which is largely insensitive to the magnetoelastic domain composition .",
    "this memory effect can be explained by the existence of helical domain walls within the ground state , which are found to be the lowest energy domain wall spin configurations in monte carlo simulations .",
    "more generally , given that similar memory effects are also reported for cuo @xcite and mnwo@xmath53 @xcite , polarization memory effects caused by helical or cycloidal domain walls may be a universal feature of ferroelectric - incommensurate to collinear - antiferromagnetic transitions .",
    "clearly , memory in a non - ferroic phase through domain walls is a very interesting concept that could be developed further to extend the temperature and magnetic - field range of magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroic systems .",
