    "neutron irradiation and carbon doping of mgb@xmath2 are two methods by which defects can systematically be introduced .",

    "carbon presumably acts as a point defect , enhancing scattering primarily within the @xmath7 band @xcite which leads to an enhancement of h@xmath3 at low doping levels @xcite in accordance with theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "up to a doping level of 10% , two gap superconductivity is preserved @xcite and evidence suggests that it may persist down to t@xmath4=0 @xcite .    due to the high neutron capture cross section of @xmath8b , neutron irradiation studies have varied as researchers have employed different techniques to ensure uniform damage throughout samples .",
    "the superconducting properties differ depending upon the irradiation conditions .",
    "enhancements in h@xmath3 have been observed for neutron irradiation on isotopically enriched mg@xmath9b@xmath2 for fluences of order 10@xmath10 n/@xmath11 @xcite , and for irradiation of mgb@xmath2 containing natural boron with a fast neutron fluence of 10@xmath12 n/@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "defects introduced by neutron irradiation , regardless of irradiation conditions , are effective at pinning vortices and for samples which exhibit a t@xmath4 above approximately 30 k show enhanced j@xmath4(h ) values in the vicinity of 20 k @xcite .",
    "we have previously reported on neutron irradiation of mgb@xmath2 filaments @xcite .",
    "although the filaments contained natural boron and mgb@xmath2 containing natural boron has a slow neutron half depth of 130 @xmath13 m , they were 140 @xmath13 m in diameter and , given that an isotropic neutron flux was used , the damage is believed to be essentially uniform throughout the samples . irradiating with a fluence level of 4.75 * 10@xmath14 n/@xmath11 resulted in a suppression of t@xmath4 to below 5 k. superconductivity was restored by performing post exposure anneals .",
    "upper critical field values were found to approximately scale with t@xmath4 .",
    "it is believed that the suppression of t@xmath4 is a result of both an increase in interband scattering and a decrease in the electron density of states at the fermi surface .",
    "the temperature dependance of the upper critical field exhibits werthamer , helfand , and hohenberg ( whh ) @xcite like behavior , which suggests the bands become fully mixed , only when t@xmath4 is near or below 10 k. the field dependence of the critical current density was found to depend largely upon the superconducting transition temperature . generally speaking",
    ", j@xmath4(h , t ) increases for samples with higher t@xmath4 values .",
    "for example the field at which filaments could carry in excess of 10@xmath15 a/@xmath11 was extended from near 1 t in an undamaged wire to above 1.5 t in the case of a sample whose annealing profile resulted in a t@xmath4 near 37 k.    given that carbon doping appears to weakly decrease t@xmath4 and increase h@xmath3 by preferentially increasing scattering within the @xmath7 band , whereas neutron damaging appears to decrease t@xmath4 and h@xmath3 by increasing the inter - band scattering , the focus of this paper is to examine the effects of combining these two scattering mechanisms by inducing and removing the effects of neutron damage in carbon doped mgb@xmath2 samples .",

    "the ( 002 ) and ( 110 ) x - ray peaks for a series of samples annealed at 500 @xmath16c for times up to 1000 hours are shown in figure [ anneal500c]a . the ( 002 ) peaks continue to broaden as the annealing time at 500@xmath16c is increased .",

    "normal state resistivity values decrease monotonically as a function of annealing temperature up until t@xmath24=450 @xmath16c , at which point @xmath25 increases approximately by a factor of four .",

    "it should be noted that all three of these filaments are from the same quartz ampoule .",
    "all three samples show a decrease in resistivity relative to that of the 500 @xmath16c annealed sample , but are still above the minimum attained by annealing at 400 @xmath16c .",
    "a plot of the normalized , @xmath26/@xmath26(300 k ) , resistivity shows that there are two interesting features in the evolution of the normal state resistivity as a function of annealing temperature ( figure [ transitions]c ) .",
    "for the samples annealed at 300 @xmath16c and 400 @xmath16c , the temperature dependence , @xmath26(t ) , has an odd hump in the 100 k to 150 k range .",
    "such a hump was not been observed in pure mgb@xmath2 wires @xcite but has been reported for for neutron damaged pure mgb@xmath2 annealed up to a temperature of 400 @xmath16c for 24 hours @xcite .",
    "the trends seen in the calculated normal state resistivity values are also seen in normalized resistivity ( figure [ transitions]c ) , indicating the apparent increase in resistivity occurring at 450 @xmath16c is a real effect and not the result of some type of geometrical effect , such as cracking .",
    "it should be noted that whereas the transport measurements show changes in the evolution of both @xmath25 and @xmath26(t ) as a function of annealing temperature for samples annealed from 300 @xmath16c to 450 @xmath16c , the magnetization data showed smooth , sharp transitions with monotonic increases in t@xmath4 throughout this range of annealing temperatures .",
    "magnetization and transport curves for the series of samples annealed at 500 @xmath16c for various times are plotted in figure [ transitions500c ] .",
    "multiple measurements of samples annealed for 1 hour and 24 hours were performed .",
    "the 1 hour anneal transport data consists of sets of two wires from two different ampoules .",
    "one set was then used for magnetization measurements and is included along with a filament from a third ampoule .",
    "the 24 hour data consists of 2 wires from a single ampoule and an additional filament from a second ampoule .",
    "the normalized magnetization transitions for the 1 hour anneals all fall below those of the 24 hour anneals ( figure [ transitions500c]a ) .",
    "however , for the transport data , the range of t@xmath4 values is broader and several of the transitions occur at temperatures greater than is seen for the 24 hour anneals ( figure [ transitions500c]b ) .",
    "it should be noted that for the samples annealed at 500 @xmath16c for 1 hour for which both magnetization and transport measurements were performed , in both cases the transport data showed a t@xmath4 that were approximately 0.5 k to 1 k higher than was observed in the magnetization measurements .",
    "such a spread was also observed in the case of neutron irradiation on pure mgb@xmath2 @xcite , suggesting the spread in the data is a reflection of sample to sample variation .",
    "the multiple transport measurements on samples annealed at 500 @xmath16c for one hour also exhibit considerable spread in the the normal state resistivity values , and no systematic evolution of @xmath25 as a function of annealing time is observed .",
    "residual resistivity ratios of these samples indicate that the observed spread in resistivity values represents true sample to sample variation in @xmath25 and is not the result of pathologic geometric problems such as cracks .    in the case of samples annealed at 500 @xmath16c for various times , generally speaking ,",
    "extending the annealing time tends to decrease @xmath22t@xmath4 , although there is considerable spread in the data ( figure [ tcvtime500c ] ) . for neutron",
    "irradiated pure mgb@xmath2 wires , @xmath22t@xmath4 , which was taken as a measure of the defect concentration , was found to decrease exponentially with time @xcite , indicating defects are being annealed out by a single activated process with random diffusion @xcite . for such samples , the defect concentration , n , obeys the relation    @xmath27    where n@xmath28 is the initial defect concentration , @xmath29 is a rate constant , and t is the time .",
    "@xmath29 is a function of the activation energy , e@xmath30 , and diffusion coefficients . for samples which do show an exponential behavior in the decrease of @xmath22t@xmath4 ( and by presumption )",
    "the defect density as a function of annealing time the activation energy can be determined by the so - called cross - cut procedure @xcite .",
    "this involves comparing the annealing time for which different temperature anneals reached the same defect density , i.e. @xmath22t@xmath4 .",
    "if a @xmath22t@xmath4 is reached by annealing at a temperature t@xmath31 for a time t@xmath31 and by annealing at a temperature t@xmath2 for a time t@xmath2 , then the activation energy is related to these quantities by :    @xmath32    unfortunately , we did not have a sufficient number of samples to perform studies of the temperature dependance of @xmath22t@xmath4 as a function of annealing time at any temperatures other than 500 @xmath16c .",
    "however , if we assume that the primary difference between neutron irradiation of pure and carbon doped mgb@xmath2 is in the activation energies , then we can gain some insight by comparing @xmath29 values attained from the two sets of samples .",
    "for the case of the carbon doped samples , since the spread in t@xmath4 for a given annealing time is so large , we can obtain only a rough estimate , based on a fitting of the midpoint of the t@xmath4 values .",
    "such a calculation yields a rate constant of @xmath29=1.61 s@xmath33 . for irradiation on pure mgb@xmath2 anneals at 200 @xmath16c , 300 @xmath16c , and 400 @xmath16c yielded rate constants of 2.77 s@xmath33 , 2.21 s@xmath33 , and 3.51 s@xmath33 respectively @xcite .",
    "although there is considerable spread in the rate constants for the pure mgb@xmath2 case , and considerable uncertainty in the rate constant associated with the carbon doped mgb@xmath2 samples ( estimates of @xmath29 from raw data range from 1.00 s@xmath33 to 2.03 s@xmath33 ) analysis of equation 2 shows that since carbon doped samples have a lower rate constant than pure mgb@xmath2 samples the activation energy is higher for carbon doped samples .",
    "it should be noted that higher reaction temperatures were required to synthesize carbon doped mgb@xmath2 than pure mgb@xmath2 @xcite , suggesting that there are different energy scales associated with carbon doping .",
    "upper critical field values were determined using the onset criteria in both resistivity versus temperature in applied fields up to 14 t and resistivity versus field in field sweeps up to 32.5 t ( figure [ infieldrho ] ) .",
    "the complete h@xmath3(t ) curves for the entire set of annealing profiles is given in figure [ hc2plot ] .",
    "the set forms a sort of `` russian doll pattern , '' with h@xmath3(t=0 ) approximately scaling with t@xmath4 .",
    "such behavior was also observed for neutron irradiation and post - exposure anneals on pure mgb@xmath2 filaments @xcite .",
    "critical currents densities were estimated from magnetization hysteresis loops using the bean critical state model @xcite for cylindrical geometry .",
    "figure [ jcplots]a shows the field dependence of j@xmath4 at t=5 k for the entire set of 24 hour anneals at various annealing temperatures . for the set of one day anneals , the in field performance improves with annealing temperature , up to 500 @xmath16c .",
    "presumably the increase transition temperature and hence decreased reduced temperature ( t / t@xmath4 ) of the measurement , is the primary cause of the enhancement .",
    "however , their exists a much greater increase in in - field j@xmath4 values between the sample annealed at 400 @xmath16c and the sample annealed at 450 @xmath16c than between the sample annealed at 300 @xmath16c and the sample annealed at 400 @xmath16c . whereas increasing the annealing temperature from 300 @xmath16c to 400 @xmath16c results in a near 7 k or 36% increase in t@xmath4 but only a factor of two improvement in j@xmath4 at all fields , increasing the annealing temperature from 400 @xmath16c to 450 @xmath16c results in only an additional 5 k increase or 17% increase in t@xmath4 , but nearly an order of magnitude increase in in - field j@xmath4 values .",
    "this suggests the increase in disorder between the hexagonal planes , which coincided with in increase in resistivity , may also play a role in enhancing the flux pinning .",
    "the sample annealed at 600 @xmath16c shows slightly reduced j@xmath4(h ) values relative to the 500 @xmath16c anneal .",
    "thus , at 600 @xmath16c , either the increased order along c is diminishing j@xmath4 , or we are beginning to anneal out some of the defects which are effective at pinning vortices , or some combination thereof .    extending the annealing time from 1 hour to 96 hours at 500 @xmath16c results in relatively minor increases in in - field",
    "j@xmath4 values ( figure [ jcplots]b ) .",
    "the data for the 500 @xmath16c and 96 hour anneal is particularly noisy and may not truly be enhanced relative to the 500 @xmath16c/10@xmath34 hour anneal .",
    "all of these 500 @xmath16c anneals show j@xmath4 remaining fairly constant over the field range of 1 - 4 tesla .    at 5 k , the best in field performance , which results from the 96 and 1000",
    "hour anneals at 500 @xmath16c , yield j@xmath4 value which maintain 10@xmath15 a/@xmath11 in an applied field of 4 t. in comparison , the best in field performance at 5 k for a sample of neutron irradiated pure mgb@xmath2 dropped below 10@xmath15 a/@xmath11 in an applied field of approximately 1.5 t @xcite and an undamaged carbon doped filament dropped below this level near 1 t @xcite .",
    "up to an annealing temperature of 400 @xmath16c , the behavior of irradiated carbon doped samples is quite similar to that of irradiation of pure mgb@xmath2 filaments .",
    "as - damaged samples have expanded unit cells and suppressed superconducting transition temperatures .",
    "post exposure annealing tends to return the lattice parameters and t@xmath4 towards the undamaged values . in both cases , the upper critical field values , h@xmath3(t=0 )",
    "tend to scale with t@xmath4 .",
    "the intriguing aspect of neutron damage in the carbon doped samples is the temperature induced decrease in structural order in the c- direction which occurs near t@xmath24=450 @xmath16c .",
    "no such effect was seen in the case of neutron irradiation in pure mgb@xmath2 filaments .",
    "the feature does nt appear to be a phase segregation as no double transition is seen in magnetization .",
    "furthermore , samples annealed at 500 @xmath16c showed sharp , single transitions in both magnetization and resistivity , while the having broad ( 002 ) peaks .",
    "the sample annealed for 24 hours at 600 @xmath16c showed evidence of having two distinct phases with different c- lattice parameters but the same a- lattice parameter . here again , both the magnetization and transport data showed only single transitions .",
    "thus the transition temperature appears to be insensitive to the c- lattice parameter .",
    "the a- lattice parameter is presumably not the sole determining factor for t@xmath4 , as samples annealed for 24 hours at 450 @xmath16c and 500 @xmath16c showed increases in @xmath22a relative to the sample annealed for 24 hours 400 @xmath16c , while also having increased t@xmath4 values . it should be noted that although measurements on single filaments showed sharp , single transitions , there was significant spread in the t@xmath4 values between different samples .",
    "the broadening of the ( 002 ) peak coincides with a near 4 fold increase in the normal state resistivity and approximate order of magnitude increase in in - field j@xmath4 values .",
    "increases in normal state resistivity for annealing temperatures above 400 @xmath16c have been observed in neutron irradiation of pure mgb@xmath2 @xcite . in this case , the authors report a continued increase in @xmath26@xmath35 as a function of annealing temperature above 400 @xmath16c and attribute it to a loss of intergrain connectivity .",
    "in contrast our data show a decrease in @xmath25 for 24 hour anneals at 500 @xmath16c and 600 @xmath16c , which supports the notion that a different mechanism is responsible for the anomalous behavior in the normal state resistivity of neutron irradiated carbon doped samples .    despite the decrease in structural order along the c- axis and large increase in resistivity at t@xmath24=450 @xmath16c , no qualitative changes to the evolution of t@xmath4 and h@xmath3 as a function of annealing temperature were observed .",
    "the transition temperature tends to approach that of the undamaged sample and h@xmath3 continues to roughly scale with t@xmath4 .",
    "even the 500 @xmath16c , 1000 hour anneal shows a suppressed h@xmath3(t=0 ) value relative to the undamaged sample .",

    "in contrast , for mg(b@xmath0c@xmath1)@xmath2 filaments exposed to a fluence of 7.13 * 10@xmath14 n/@xmath11 and subsequently annealed for 24 hours at various temperatures , the apparent anomalous increase occurs for an annealing temperature of 450 @xmath16c . for both sets of samples , following the abrupt increase ,",
    "the normal state resistivity decreases monotonically as a function of annealing temperature .",
    "it should be noted however , that , in the case of the carbon doped samples , it is not clear whether or not there exists some correlation between the change in the temperature dependence of the normal state resistivity for the 300 @xmath16c and 400 @xmath16c anneals and the reduced @xmath25 values for these anneals .",
    "that is , rather than the jump in @xmath25 at 450 @xmath16c representing an anomalous increase , the @xmath25 values associated with the samples annealed at 300 @xmath16c and 400 @xmath16c may in fact be anomalously low .",
    "these data , coupled with the analysis of the rate constants , suggest that in the case of neutron irradiated carbon doped mgb@xmath2 samples , there is a different , and higher , energy scale associated with the annealing of defects .",
    "this is perhaps not altogether surprising , as it was shown that higher reaction temperatures were necessary to form the carbon doped phase . whereas pure boron filaments can be fully converted to mgb@xmath2 in as little as 2 hours at 950 @xmath16c @xcite , isothermal reactions required 48 hours at 1200 @xmath16c to convert carbon doped boron fibers to mg(b@xmath36c@xmath37)@xmath2 , even for doping levels as low as x=0.004 @xcite .",
    "although diffusion of mg vapor into a carbon doped boron matrix and repair of neutron induced damage are indeed two , rather different , phenomena , this correlation is at least worth noting .",
    "the temperature dependence of the upper critical field shows positive curvature near t@xmath4 for samples with a t@xmath4 near 26 k and above ( figure [ hc2plot ] ) . for the samples annealed for 24 hours at 200 @xmath16c and 300 @xmath16c",
    "h@xmath3 approaches t@xmath4 linearly . if the two bands are fully mixed , the temperature dependance of the upper critical field should follow whh @xcite behavior , where h@xmath3(t=0 ) is given by :    @xmath38    calculating h@xmath3(t=0 ) using equation 3 for the samples annealed for 24 hours at 200 @xmath16c , 300 @xmath16c , and 400 @xmath16c yields values of 2.4 t , 5.2 t , and 6.5 t. experimentally , lowest temperate h@xmath3 values we could reliably attain from transport measurements for each of these samples were 2.1 t , 6.5 t , and 10 t , occurring at temperatures of 4.2 k , 5.2 k , and 4.6 k respectively .",
    "only for the sample annealed at 200 @xmath16c does the whh fit yield an h@xmath3(t=0 ) value which is consistent with the experimentally observed data .",
    "thus it is likely that only for samples with a t@xmath4 below 10 k are the bands fully mixed .",
    "such a result was also obtained in the case of the neutron irradiation on pure mgb@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this implies that the inter - band scattering rates resulting from defects associated with the neutron irradiation are comparable in both pure and carbon doped samples , suggesting that the scattering associated with the two different sources of defects act independently .",
    "this is not altogether surprising as the suppression in t@xmath4 for carbon doped samples is believed to result from changes in the fermi surface , rather than increases in inter - band scattering and scattering associated with carbon doping is believed to be primarily within the @xmath7 band @xcite .",
    "thus if inter - band scatting is introduced primarily through defects resulting from neutron damage , if pure and carbon doped samples have similar initial t@xmath4 values , then they should also exhibit fully mixed bands at similar t@xmath4s , which was experimentally observed .",
    "a similar result was found in the case of neutron irradiation on pure mgb@xmath2 filaments , implying that the scattering associated with carbon doping and neutron irradiation act independently .",
    "we have studied superconducting and normal state properties of neutron irradiated carbon doped mgb@xmath2 filaments as a function of post exposure annealing time and temperature . in spite of anomolous behavior in the evolution of the c- lattice parameter and",
    "normal state resistivity t@xmath4 tended to return towards the undamaged value with increased annealing time and temperature .",
    "upper critical field values were found to approximately scale with t@xmath4 and exhibited whh like behavior , suggesting a complete mixing of the two bands , for samples with t@xmath4 near 10 k. neutron irradiation of pure mgb@xmath2 also led to a complete mixing of the bands near 10 k , suggesting that the scattering associated with carbon doping and neutron irradiation act independently .",
