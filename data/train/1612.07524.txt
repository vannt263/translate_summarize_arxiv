    "a crucial aspect of many recent studies of extragalactic sne is to establish the links between the nature of sn progenitors and stellar populations of their host galaxies .",
    "the most direct method for this is through their identification on pre - sn images .",
    "however , the number of such sne is small and is limited to the nearby core - collapse ( cc ) events .",
    "these limitations force us to study the properties of sn progenitors through indirect methods .    the properties of sn host galaxies , such as the morphology , color , nuclear activity , star formation rate ( sfr ) , metallicity , stellar population , age , etc .",
    "provide strong clues to the understanding of the progenitors .",
    "sn hosts in multiple systems of galaxies can also provide important constraints relating the star formation distribution / rate in strongly interacting systems with the different sn progenitors .",
    "in particular , valuable information of the nature of progenitors can be obtained through the study of the radial , azimuthal , and vertical ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) distributions of sne and their environments .    by this contribution",
    ", we present a brief summary of our results recently obtained in this field .",
    "provides a large and well - defined database that combines extensive new measurements and a literature search of about four thousand sne and their host galaxies located in the sky area covered by the sdss data release 8 .",
    "this database is much larger than previous ones , and provides a homogeneous set of global parameters of sn hosts , including measurements of apparent magnitudes , diameters , axial ratios , position angles , morphological classifications , and activity classes of nuclei .",
    "special attention was paid to collect accurate data on the spectroscopic classes , coordinates , offsets of sne , and heliocentric redshifts of the host galaxies . in @xcite",
    ", we also classified the morphological disturbances of nearby host galaxies from the visible signs of galaxy  galaxy interactions in the sdss .",
    "all the presented results in the next section are mostly based on this database , which is publicly available .",
    "in this section , we list the results accompanied with short discussions . for more details , the reader is referred to .      *",
    "the mean morphological type of spiral galaxies hosting type ia sne is significantly earlier than the mean host type for all other types of cc sne , which are consistent with one another .",
    "* we find a strong trend in the behaviour of @xmath0 depending on host - galaxy morphological type , such that early - type ( high - mass or high - luminosity ) spirals include proportionally more type ia sne .",
    "ratio is a good tracer of specific sfr [ ssfr ] . ]",
    "the behaviour of @xmath0 versus morphology is a simple reflection of the behaviour of 1/ssfr versus morphological types of galaxies . *",
    "the @xmath0 ratio is nearly constant when changing from normal , perturbed to interacting galaxies , then declines in merging galaxies , whereas it jumps to the highest value in post - merging / remnant host galaxies . during the relatively short time - scale of the merging stage ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the spiral , gas - rich galaxies do not have enough time to produce many type ia sne , but can intensively produce cc sne , assuming short lifetimes for the cc sne progenitors .",
    "in the post - merging / remnant galaxies with longer time - scale , the sfrs and morphologies of host galaxies are strongly affected , significantly increasing the @xmath0 ratio . *",
    "the @xmath1 ratio is nearly constant when changing from normal , perturbed to interacting galaxies , then jumps to the highest value in merging galaxies and slightly declines in post - merging / remnant subsample . in our merging hosts , the positions of cc sne , particularly sne of ibc type ,",
    "mostly coincide with the circumnuclear regions and only in few cases with bright h  ii regions , which is in agreement with the previously found central excess of cc sne in extremely disturbed or merging galaxies .",
    "* type ibc sne are located in pairs of galaxies with significantly smaller difference of radial velocities between components than pairs containing types ia and ii sne .",
    "we consider this as a result of higher sfr of these closer systems of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "sn types are not correlated with the luminosity ratio of host and neighbor galaxies in pairs . * the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) ratio increases ( decreases ) when moving from sf , c , to sy@xmath2liner activity classes for the host galaxies . in the invoked scenario ,",
    "the interaction is responsible for morphological disturbances and for partially sending gas inward , which first triggers star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and increases ssfr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , in the sf stage , we observe a lower value of the @xmath0 ratio and a somewhat higher value of the @xmath1 ratio as in morphologically disturbed ( interacting or merging ) late - type galaxies .",
    "the starburst then fades with time and the c ( composite of sf and agn ) class evolves to the agn [ sy@xmath2liner ] ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a comparatively relaxed disturbance , early - type morphology , poor gas fraction , and old stellar population",
    ". therefore , in the agn stage , we observe inverse values of the ratios as in morphologically less disturbed ( relaxed ) early - type galaxies .      * in sa ",
    "sm galaxies , all cc and the vast majority of type ia sne belong to the disc , rather than the bulge component .",
    "this result suggests that the rate of sne ia in spiral galaxies is dominated by a relatively young / intermediate progenitor population .",
    "* the radial distribution of type ia sne in s0s0/a galaxies is inconsistent with that in sa  sm hosts .",
    "this inconsistency is mostly attributed to the contribution by sne ia in the outer bulges of s0s0/a galaxies . in these hosts ,",
    "the relative fraction of bulge to disc sne ia is probably changed in comparison with that in sa  sm hosts , because the progenitor population from the discs of s0s0/a galaxies should be much lower due to the lower number of young / intermediate stellar populations . * the radial distribution of cc sne in barred sa ",
    "sbc galaxies is not consistent with that of unbarred sa ",
    "sbc hosts , while for type ia sne the distributions are not significantly different .",
    "at the same time , the radial distributions of both type ia and cc sne in sc ",
    "sm galaxies are not affected by bars .",
    "these results are explained by a substantial suppression of massive star formation in the radial range swept by strong bars of early - type barred galaxies . * the radial distribution of cc sne , in contrast",
    "to type ia sne , is inconsistent with the exponential surface density profile , because of the central ( @xmath3 ) deficit of sne .",
    "is the sdss @xmath4-band @xmath5 magnitude isophotal semimajor axis of sn host galaxy .",
    "] however , in the @xmath6 range , the inconsistency vanishes for cc sne in most of the subsamples of spiral galaxies . in the inner - truncated disc , only the radial distribution of cc sne in",
    "barred early - type spirals is inconsistent with an exponential surface density profile , which appears to be caused by the impact of bars on the radial distribution of cc sne .",
    "* in the inner regions of non - disturbed spiral hosts , we do not detect a relative deficiency of type ia sne with respect to cc , contrary to what was found by other authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , who had explained this by possibly stronger dust extinction for type ia than for cc sne . instead , the radial distributions of both types of sne are similar in all the subsamples of sa  sbc and sc  sm galaxies , which supports the idea that the relative increase of cc sne in the inner regions of spirals found by the other authors is most probably due to the central excess of cc sne in disturbed galaxies .      * the orientation of sne in host with respect to the preferred direction toward neighbor galaxy is found to be isotropic and independent of kinematical properties of the galaxy pair . *",
    "the vertical distribution of cc sne is significantly different from that of type ia sne , being about twice more concentrated to the plane of the disc in edge - on host galaxies .",
    "the vertical distribution of cc sne can be assigned to the younger thin disc population , while the distribution of type ia sne is consistent with the older thick disc of edge - on galaxies .",
    "the obtained results show that the spatial distributions and the number ratios of different sne are powerful tools to constrain the natures of their progenitors and to better understand the star formation processes in various types of galaxies .",
