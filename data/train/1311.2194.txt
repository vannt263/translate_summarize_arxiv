    "in this work we study the evolution of the interface between two different incompressible fluids with the same viscosity coefficient in a porous medium with two different permeabilities .",
    "this problem is of practical importance because it is used as a model for a geothermal reservoir ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the velocity of a fluid flowing in a porous medium satisfies darcy s law ( see @xcite ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the dynamic viscosity , @xmath4 is the permeability of the medium , @xmath5 is the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath6 is the density of the fluid , @xmath7 is the pressure of the fluid and @xmath8 is the incompressible velocity field . in our favourite units",
    ", we can assume @xmath9    the spatial domains considered in this work are @xmath10 ( infinite depth ) and @xmath11 ( finite depth ) .",
    "we have two immiscible and incompressible fluids with the same viscosity and different densities ; @xmath12 fill in the upper domain @xmath13 and @xmath14 fill in the lower domain @xmath15 .",
    "the curve @xmath16 is the interface between the fluids .",
    "in particular we are making the ansatz that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are a partition of @xmath19 and they are separated by a curve @xmath20 .",
    "the system is in the stable regime if the denser fluid is below the lighter one , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath21 .",
    "this is known in the literature as the rayleigh - taylor condition .",
    "the function that measures this condition is defined as @xmath22    in the case with @xmath23 , the motion of a fluid in a two - dimensional porous medium is analogous to the hele - shaw cell problem ( see @xcite and the references therein ) and if the fluids fill the whole plane ( in the case with the same viscosity but different densities ) the contour equation satisfies ( see @xcite ) @xmath24 they show the existence of classical solution locally in time ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) in the rayleigh - taylor stable regime which means that @xmath21 , and maximum principles for @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in @xcite the authors show that there exists initial data in @xmath27 such that @xmath28 blows up in finite time .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite the authors prove that there exist analytic initial data in the stable regime for the muskat problem such that the solution turns to the unstable regime and later no longer belongs to @xmath29 . in @xcite",
    "the authors show an energy balance for @xmath30 and that if initially @xmath31 , then there is global lipschitz solution and if the initial datum has @xmath32 then there is global classical solution . in @xcite",
    "the authors study the case with different viscosities . in @xcite",
    "the authors study the case where the interface reach the boundary in a moving point with a constant ( non - zero ) angle .",
    "the case where the fluid domain is the strip @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , has been studied in @xcite . in this regime",
    "the equation for the interface is @xmath35}d\\eta . \\label{iieq0.1}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    for equation the authors in @xcite obtain the existence of classical solution locally in time in the stable regime case where the initial interface does not reach the boundaries , and the existence of finite time singularities .",
    "these singularities mean that the curve is initially a graph in the stable regime , and in finite time , the curve can not be parametrized as a graph and the interface turns to the unstable regime .",
    "also the authors study the effect of the boundaries on the evolution of the interface , obtaining the maximum principle and a decay estimate for @xmath36 and the maximum principle for @xmath28 for initial datum satisfying smallness conditions on @xmath37 and on @xmath38 .",
    "so , not only the slope must be small , also amplitude of the curve plays a role .",
    "both result differs from the results corresponding to the infinite depth case .",
    "we note that the case with boundaries can also be understood as a problem with different permeabilities where the permeability outside vanishes . in the forthcoming work @xcite",
    "the authors compare the different models , and from the point of view of the existence of turning waves .",
    "in this work we study the case where permeability @xmath4 is a step function , more precisely , we have a curve @xmath39 separating two regions with different values for the permeability ( see figure [ iischeme ] ) .",
    "we study the regime with infinite depth , for periodic and for `` flat at infinity '' initial datum , but also the case where the depth is finite and equal to @xmath40 . in the region above the curve @xmath41 the permeability is @xmath42 , while in the region below the curve @xmath41 the permeability is @xmath43 .",
    "note that the curve @xmath41 is known and fixed .",
    "then it follows from darcy s law that the vorticity is @xmath44 where @xmath45 corresponds to the difference of the densities , @xmath46 corresponding to the difference of permeabilities and @xmath47 is the usual dirac s distribution .",
    "in fact both amplitudes for the vorticity are quite different , while @xmath45 is a derivative , the amplitude @xmath46 has a nonlocal character ( see , and section [ iisec2 ] ) .",
    "the equation for the interface , when @xmath48 and the fluid fill the whole plane , is @xmath49 with @xmath50 if the fluids fill the whole space but the initial curve is periodic the equation reduces to @xmath51 where the second vorticity amplitude can be written as @xmath52    if we consider the regime where the amplitude of the wave and the depth of the medium are of the same order then the equation for the interface , when the depth is chosen to be @xmath53 , is @xmath54 where @xmath55 with @xmath56 a schwartz function .    for notational simplicity",
    ", we denote @xmath57 and we drop the @xmath58 dependence .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ iisec2 ] we derive the contour equations , and . in section [ iisec3 ]",
    "we show the local in time solvability and an energy balance for the @xmath30 norm . in section [ iisec5 ]",
    "we perform numerics and in section [ iisec4 ] we obtain finite time singularities for equations and when the physical parameters are in some region and numerical evidence showing that , in fact , every value is valid for the physical parameters .",
    "in this section we derive the contour equations , and , _ i.e. _ the equations for the interface .",
    "first we obtain the equation in the infinite depth case , both , flat at infinity and periodic . given @xmath59 a scalar , @xmath60 curves , and a spatial domain @xmath61 or @xmath62 , we denote the birkhoff - rott integral as @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the kernel of @xmath65 ( which depends on the domain ) .",
    "if the domain is @xmath0 we have @xmath66 for @xmath67 we have @xmath68 and for @xmath11 the kernel is ( see @xcite ) @xmath69        using the kernel , we obtain @xmath71 where @xmath72    we have @xmath73 and @xmath74 we observe that @xmath75 is the limit inside @xmath17 ( the upper subdomain ) and @xmath76 is the limit inside @xmath18 ( the lower subdomain ) .",
    "the curve @xmath77 does nt touch the curve @xmath41 , so , the limit for the curve @xmath78 are in the same domain @xmath79 .    using darcy s law and assuming that the initial interface @xmath80 is in the region with permeability @xmath81 , we obtain @xmath82 where in the last equality we have used the continuity of the pressure along the interface ( see @xcite ) . using we conclude @xmath83 we need to determine @xmath46 .",
    "we consider @xmath84&=&\\left(\\frac{v^-(h(\\alpha))}{\\kappa^2}-\\frac{v^+(h(\\alpha))}{\\kappa^1}\\right)\\cdot{\\partial_\\alpha}h(\\alpha)\\\\ & = & -{\\partial_\\alpha}(p^-(h(\\alpha))-p^+(h(\\alpha)))\\\\ & = & 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first equality is due to darcy s law .",
    "using the expression we have @xmath85=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\kappa^2}-\\frac{1}{\\kappa^1}\\right)\\left(br(\\varpi_1,z)h+br(\\varpi_2,h)h\\right)\\cdot{\\partial_\\alpha}h(\\alpha)+\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\kappa^2}+\\frac{1}{2\\kappa^1}\\right)\\varpi_2.\\ ] ] we take @xmath86 , with @xmath87 a fixed constant . then @xmath88 where @xmath89 denotes the hilbert transform . finally , we have @xmath90 ( see remark 1 for the definition of @xmath91 ) .",
    "the identity @xmath92 gives us @xmath93 and @xmath94 thus , @xmath95 and @xmath96 due to the conservation of mass the curve @xmath20 is advected by the flow , but we can add any tangential term in the equation for the evolution of the interface without changing the shape of the resulting curve ( see @xcite ) , _ i.e. _ we consider that the equation for the curve is @xmath97 taking @xmath98 , we conclude @xmath99    by choosing this tangential term , if our initial datum can be parametrized as a graph , we have @xmath100 therefore the parametrization as a graph propagates .",
    "finally we conclude as the evolution equation for the interface ( which initially is a graph above the line @xmath101 ) .",
    "we remark that the second vorticity can be written in equivalent ways    @xmath102    notice that in the case with different viscosities the expression for the amplitude of the vorticity located at the interface @xmath77 ( see equation ) is no longer valid . instead , we have @xmath103 to this integral equation , we add the equation or .",
    "thus , one needs to invert an operator .",
    "this is a rather delicate issue that is beyond the scope of this paper ( see @xcite for further details in the case @xmath104 ) .",
    "we have that is still valid , but now @xmath106 are periodic functions and @xmath107 . using complex variables notation",
    "we have @xmath108 changing variables and using the identity @xmath109 we obtain @xmath110 equivalently , @xmath111 recall that and are still valid if @xmath86 for @xmath112 a fixed constant .",
    "we have @xmath113 thus , the velocity in the curve when the correct tangential terms are added is @xmath114 we can do the same in order to write @xmath46 as an integral on the torus . @xmath115",
    "if the initial datum can be parametrized as a graph the equation for the interface reduces to , where the second vorticity amplitude can be written as @xmath116      now we consider the bounded porous medium @xmath117 ( see figure [ iischeme ] ) .",
    "this regime is equivalent to the case with more than two @xmath118 because the boundaries can be understood as regions with @xmath119 .",
    "as before , @xmath120 we assume that @xmath86 with @xmath121 .",
    "we have that @xmath45 is given by . the main difference between the finite depth and the infinite depth is at the level of @xmath46 . as in the infinite depth case",
    "we have @xmath122 where now @xmath123 has the usual definition in terms of @xmath64 in expression .",
    "in the unbounded case we have an explicit expression for @xmath46 in terms of @xmath20 and @xmath78 , but now we have a fredholm integral equation of second kind : @xmath124    after taking the fourier transform , denoted by @xmath125 , and using some of its basic properties , we have @xmath126 we can solve the equation for @xmath46 for any @xmath127 with @xmath128 we obtain @xmath129 now we observe that if @xmath130 is a function in the schwartz class , @xmath131 , such that @xmath132 we have that @xmath133 and we obtain @xmath134 recall here that in order to obtain @xmath46 we invert an integral operator . in general",
    "this is a delicate issue ( compare with @xcite ) , but with our choice of @xmath78 this point can be addressed in a simpler way . using @xmath135 and adding the correct tangential term",
    ", we obtain @xmath136 if the initial curve can be parametrized as a graph the equation reduces to where @xmath46 is defined in .",
    "if @xmath137 by an explicit computation we obtain @xmath138 , thus , any @xmath91 is valid . moreover , we have tested numerically that the same remains valid for any @xmath121 , so would be correct for any @xmath91 .",
