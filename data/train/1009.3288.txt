    "what follows limitations on experimental realizations are discussed .",
    "first we consider the realizability of an approximately one dimensional situation necessary for the validity of our theoretical results .",
    "let us assume that the gaussian beam propagates in the @xmath162 direction .",
    "its profile in the @xmath163 plane is @xmath164 assuming that the extent of the light beam is much smaller than the rayleigh length , @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the wavelength , and the @xmath162 dependence of the potential can be ignored .",
    "the potential of eq . can be well approximated by @xmath167 in , for sufficiently small values of @xmath168 , and , to facilitate this , it is appropriate to consider @xmath169 , i.e. , a quasi - sheet - like beam .",
    "such beams are experimentally realizable via routine methods .",
    "to analyze this situation , the normalized map @xmath10 of should be replaced by one with @xmath170 replaced by @xmath171\\right)$ ] .",
    "in addition , there are equations for @xmath172 and its conjugate momentum @xmath173 , which in dimensionless units with @xmath174 and @xmath173 rescaled by @xmath175 and @xmath176 , respectively , take the form,@xmath177 where      since @xmath179 and @xmath180 , it can be assumed that @xmath181 .",
    "therefore , the motion in the @xmath174 direction is slow relative to the motion in the @xmath28 direction .",
    "thus @xmath182 can be approximated by its time average @xmath183 ( which is of order unity ) , and , for sufficiently small @xmath174 the @xmath184motion can be described by a harmonic oscillator with a force constant @xmath185 .",
    "conservation of energy @xmath186 implies that the maximal value of @xmath174 satisfies@xmath187 the energy @xmath186 is determined by the initial preparation .",
    "let us assume that initially the atoms form a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) and are in a harmonic trap that is anisotropic where the frequency in the @xmath174 direction is @xmath188 in experimental units , and @xmath189 in our rescaled units .",
    "we assume that the center of this trap @xmath190 satisfies @xmath191 .",
    "the experiment starts when the trap is turned off . assuming the atoms are in the ground state , their energy in our rescales units is@xmath192 we desire the effect of the motion in the @xmath174 direction on the motion in the @xmath28 direction ( eq . with @xmath167",

    "it is also encouraging to see that noise of a higher level does not destroy fidelity oscillations ( see fig .",

    "one should note , however , that the variation of the effective @xmath29 of the motion in the @xmath28 direction is slow , with effective frequency @xmath212 that for @xmath205 is of order @xmath213 . for these reasons",
