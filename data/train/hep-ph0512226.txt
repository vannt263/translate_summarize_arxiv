    "the njl model is a low - energy effective theory for qcd and as such widely used for investigating the phase structure of qcd as a function of temperature and chemical potentials .",
    "many studies have been carried out for equal quark chemical potentials , that is @xmath0 .",
    "this constraint does not necessarily hold in realistic situations .",
    "for example , in a compact star in equilibrium under the weak interactions @xmath1 , and @xmath2 is tuned in such a way that the star becomes electrically neutral @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is useful and interesting to investigate the phase diagram of the njl model as a function of different chemical potentials .",
    "it turns out that the njl model has a rich phase structure with phases in which chiral symmetry is broken , different color superconducting phases and phases in which the pseudoscalar mesons condense . in the",
    "last mentioned phase a field with the same quantum numbers as the pion or the kaon obtains a vacuum expectation value , that is the condensates @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 are nonzero .",
    "the interesting feature of these phases is that parity is broken there .",
    "the existence of a pion condensate @xcite is also confirmed on the lattice at finite isospin chemical potential with zero baryon chemical potential @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented in this article ( and in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is an extension of previous studies in which either only pseudoscalar condensation @xcite or only color superconductivity @xcite was taken into account . here",
    "both possibilities will be investigated simultaneously . the more complete phase diagrams which we have calculated are not merely a superposition of the phase diagrams obtained earlier , since it turns out that there is competition between the color superconducting phases and the phases in which the pseudoscalar mesons condense . if the chemical potentials of the quarks are large and approximately equal , for example @xmath6 , it is possible that an up and a down quark form a diquark condensate giving rise to a two - flavor color superconducting ( 2sc ) phase .",
    "if the chemical potentials of the quarks are large and approximately opposite to each other , for example @xmath7 it is possible that an up and a strange quark form a charged kaon condensate @xmath4 .",
    "so one might wonder what would happen if @xmath8 , could a 2sc phase appear together with a phase in which the charged kaon meson condenses ?",
    "we find that the color superconducting phases and the phase in which the pseudoscalar mesons condense are always separated by a first order transition for any temperature for a set of realistic parameters chosen .",
    "the three - flavor njl model we use is derived from a 4-point color current - current interaction and given by the following lagrangian density ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a coupling constant , @xmath11 is a diagonal matrix containing the up , down and strange quark masses and @xmath12 a diagonal matrix containing the up , down and strange quark chemical potentials .",
    "the constants @xmath13 , since the one gluon exchange interaction is only attractive in the antisymmetric color and flavor triplet channel .",
    "the matrices @xmath14 are the @xmath15 generators of @xmath16 and act in flavor space .",
    "they are normalized as @xmath17 .",
    "the matrices @xmath18 are the generators of @xmath16 and act in color space .",
    "their normalization is @xmath19 . to remind the reader , the antisymmetric flavor matrices @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 couple up to down , up to strange and down to strange quarks , respectively .",
    "the charge conjugate of a field @xmath23 is denoted by @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath26 of the diquark interaction is fixed by the fierz transformation ( see for example ref .",
    "however , other choices for this coupling strength are also made in the literature .",
    "the njl model has a symmetry structure similar to qcd , except for the local color symmetry .",
    "the njl model is only invariant under global su(3 ) color transformations since it does not contain gauge fields . in absence of quark masses and chemical potentials ,",
    "the lagrangian density of the njl model has a global @xmath27 symmetry . due to the non - vanishing quark masses ,",
    "the symmetry is like in qcd broken down to @xmath28 . since the masses of the quark and",
    "the chemical potentials are chosen to be different , the symmetry of the lagrangian density is further reduced to @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 stand respectively for baryon , isospin ( the @xmath33-component ) and hypercharge number .",
    "these remaining symmetries can be used to rotate away several possible condensates which simplifies the analysis in the end .",
    "the results that will be presented here are obtained with the following choice of parameters which were also used in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath34 these are the precise values used in the calculations , but clearly not all digits are significant implying that a small change of parameters will not have a big influence on the results .",
    "this choice of parameters gives rise to constituent quark masses @xmath35 mev and @xmath36 mev .",
    "to obtain a phase diagram one has to investigate the behavior of order parameters like the chiral condensates @xmath37 , the pseudoscalar condensates @xmath38 and the diquark condensates @xmath39 .",
    "the values of these order parameters can be found by minimizing the effective potential .",
    "the effective potential can be obtained by the introduction of auxiliary fields which are then shifted in such a way that the action of the njl becomes quadratic in the fermion fields .",
    "after integration over the fermion fields and replacing the auxiliary fields by their vacuum expectation values , it turns out @xcite that the effective potential in the mean field approximation is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 the matrix @xmath42 is the identity matrix in color ( @xmath43 ) , flavor ( @xmath44 ) , or dirac ( @xmath45 ) space .    by minimizing the effective potential",
    "it was found numerically that of the chiral condensates only @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 can be nonzero .",
    "so the chiral condensates @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 appear , while for example a @xmath52 condensate is impossible .",
    "the chiral condensates can be found in the phase diagram at low chemical potentials and temperatures .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that the pseudoscalar condensates @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are always nonzero",
    ". however , the other pseudoscalar condensates can appear . using the @xmath56 flavor symmetries one can reduce the possible set of pseudoscalar condensates to @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which are respectively a pion ( @xmath60 ) , a charged kaon ( @xmath61 ) , and a neutral kaon @xmath62 condensate .",
    "all these condensates break parity .",
    "pion condensation is possible if @xmath63 @xcite where @xmath64 is the mass of the pion , while kaon condensation is possible if @xmath65 @xcite where @xmath66 is the kaon mass .",
    "the different possible color - superconducting phases are named as follows ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath67 the abbreviation cfl stands for color - flavor locked phase .",
    "if there is exact @xmath68 flavor symmetry , the three diquark condensates in this phase have equal size and the vacuum is invariant under a combined rotation in color and flavor space @xcite . in the usc ,",
    "dsc or ssc phase the up , down or strange quark always takes part in the diquark condensate , respectively . in the 2sc phase an up and a down quark form a diquark condensate , in the 2scus and the 2scds phase this condensate is formed by an up and and strange quark and a down and a strange quark , respectively .",
    "the color superconducting phases of the njl model are not color neutral . in order to achieve color neutrality",
    ", one should introduce color chemical potentials @xcite .",
    "however , we leave this for further work .    to calculate the effective potential one needs to evaluate a determinant of a @xmath69 matrix .",
    "only in special cases such as when all masses and chemical potentials are equal and in absence of pseudoscalar condensation one can perform the sum over matsubara frequencies analytically and hence simplify the effective potential somewhat further .",
    "but in the more general cases which will be discussed in this article this either is not possible or gives rise to very complicated equations .",
    "we therefore calculated and minimized the effective potential numerically .",
    "some of the phase diagrams we obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] .",
    "our results agree qualitatively with the phase diagrams with only pseudoscalar condensation presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and the phase diagram with only superconductivity presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "one can clearly see that the phase diagrams evaluated at @xmath70 are symmetric under reflection in the origin .",
    "this is because the free energy is invariant under the transformation @xmath71 from the symmetry between particles and anti - particles .",
    "in general , horizontal and vertical lines in the phase diagrams arise if the pairing of one type of quark is not changed after a transition . in this case",
    ", the location of the phase boundary is determined by the properties of other quarks .",
    "therefore , changing the chemical potential of the unchanged quark species can not have a big influence on the location of the phase boundary .",
    "this results in the horizontal and vertical lines . for @xmath70",
    ", one always finds these lines near the values of the constituent quark masses , i.e.  @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( see for example ref .",
    "the diagonal lines arise because at @xmath70 pion condensation can occur if @xmath75 @xcite and kaon condensation can occur if @xmath76 @xcite ( the chosen parameter set gives rise to a somewhat low kaon mass , but this is not relevant for the qualitative features of the phase diagram ) .",
    "the diagrams show that if the chemical potentials are different from each other , the transition to the color - superconducting phases ( n / p / q / t / s ) remains first order at @xmath70 as was concluded in ref.@xcite .",
    "the lower right figure shows that this conclusion does no longer hold at finite temperature .",
    "moreover , one can see from the upper left diagram that if @xmath77 it is possible to go through two first - order transitions before entering the 2sc phase ( q ) ( similar to the situation discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite without color superconductivity ) .",
    "we observe that to have such a scenario at zero temperature , a minimum difference between @xmath2 and @xmath78 is required . in the present case",
    "this is about 35 mev .",
    "pion condensation ( i ) and the 2sc phase ( q ) are in this diagram separated by two phase transitions in contrast to the estimated @xmath79 phase diagram of ref .",
    "@xcite . the two lower phase diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] ( these phase diagrams were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath80 ) are of relevance for studying situations which are in weak equilibrium ( @xmath1 ) , but not necessarily electrically neutral . in that case",
    "there are situations in which a charged kaon condensate ( j ) is competing against a color superconducting phase ( s ) . from the diagrams",
    "it can be seen that the color superconducting phases are separated from the phase in which the charged kaon condenses for any temperature and all values of the chemical potentials .",
    "the same conclusion holds for a pion condensate @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we presented phase diagrams of the three - flavor njl model as a function of flavor chemical potentials and temperature .",
    "we found that the phases with pseudoscalar condensation are separated from the color superconducting phases by a first order transition for any temperature .",
    "although many regions in the phase diagrams were or will never be realized in nature , these diagrams may be relevant for comparison with possible future lattice data .",
    "this work could be extended with the inclusion of the electric and color neutrality constraints , the discussion of gapless phases , and the investigation of the effect of t hooft s instanton - induced interaction on the phases with pseudoscalar condensation .",
