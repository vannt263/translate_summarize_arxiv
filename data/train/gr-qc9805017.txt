    "a well - known property of the static , incompressible interior schwarzschild space - time is conformal flatness , _ i.e. _ , the weyl tensor vanishing : @xmath0 .",
    "the weyl tensor can be split into two parts , the _ electric _ and _ magnetic _ parts .",
    "the first part represents the tidal forces of the curvature , while the second part ( which has no newtonian analogue ) is generated by the vorticity , shear , etc .  of the congruence to which the electric and magnetic parts are related .",
    "therefore , rotating matter can be viewed as partly responsible for the existence of the magnetic part of the curvature @xcite .",
    "a simple example of a space - time containing rotating matter is expected to be a perfect fluid with a purely magnetic weyl tensor .",
    "little is known about space - times with a magnetic curvature .",
    "_ @xcite have obtained an example of these space - times , albeit with an unknown equation of state .",
    "another solution , suggested in @xcite is , however , shown to be not purely magnetic by mcintosh @xcite .",
    "to get some more insight on the subject , in this paper we investigate perfect fluid space - times with axistationary symmetry .",
    "we confine our attention to circularly rotating matter , _",
    "i.e. _ , the four - velocity lying in the plane of the two killing vectors .",
    "thus we may choose the line element in its papapetrou form , @xmath1 \\ .\\ ] ] we choose the canonical frame @xmath2 and project all quantities onto this .",
    "a space - time is locally completely determined by the set @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the components of the riemann tensor , @xmath5 are the rotation coefficients , @xmath6 the gradients of the essential coordinates , and @xmath7 is the constant metric in the chosen frame @xcite .",
    "the set @xmath8 may be calculated using the frame ( [ eq : frame ] ) and has a form characteristic of the metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) .",
    "we still have some freedom in performing lorentz transformations of the frame ( [ eq : frame ] ) , _",
    "e.g. _ , rotations in the ( 1,2)-plane ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : equations ] ) .",
    "these transformations will change the appearance of the components of , say , the riemann tensor , but will not introduce new _ non - zero _ components of this tensor .",
    "this freedom can be exploited to make the set @xmath8 as simple as possible .",
    "there is also a boost freedom , which does not introduce any new non - zero components of the tensors in the set @xmath8 .",
    "this can be used to put the frame ( [ eq : frame ] ) in a comoving form , thus giving a natural interpretation of ( some of ) the ricci rotation coefficients in terms of fluid variables ( such as vorticity ) .",
    "if we start with a set @xmath8 , instead of generating the set @xmath8 from a metric satisfying einstein s field equations , we need to impose certain restrictions on the elements of the set in order to guarantee that @xmath8 can be generated by a line - element that satisfy cartan s equations under the restriction of einstein s field equations .",
    "in general , these conditions are part of the commutator equations , ricci equations , and bianchi equations @xcite .",
    "the approach taken in this paper proceeds in the following steps :    1 .",
    "investigate the form of @xmath8 in the lorentz frame ( [ eq : frame ] ) for the metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) .",
    "2 .   analyze the properties of this @xmath8 under lorentz transformations .",
    "3 .   using the knowledge obtained in the steps above , make an _ ansatz _ for the set @xmath8 .",
    "4 .   subject the elements of this ansatz to the necessary and sufficient equations ( in general , parts of the commutator equations , ricci equations , and bianchi equations ) .",
    "use the fact that part of the variables in @xmath8 are the components of the weyl tensor to investigate magnetic space - times .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : equations ] we derive the equations describing an axisymmetric and stationary perfect fluid space - time .",
    "these are the commutators acting on the `` essential coordinates '' ( on which all quantities in @xmath8 depend ) and the ricci equations .",
    "the bianchi equations are not needed , but in practice they are very useful when there are restrictions on the weyl tensor .",
    "all these equations are first order partial differential equations in terms of two variables for the quantities in the set @xmath8 .",
    "also , @xmath8 is chosen as to be compatible with the metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) in a lorentz transformed version of the frame ( [ eq : frame ] ) .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : magnetic ] we investigate the restrictions of sec .  [ sec : equations ] in the case of a purely magnetic weyl tensor .",
    "specifically , we examine what space - times are allowed under the further restriction of incompressible fluid ( constant energy density ) or shear - free motion of the fluid ( rigid rotation ) .",
    "section [ sec : metric ] describes how to obtain the full metric of the space - time .",
    "we focus on the physically important shear free space - times .",
