    "for each time point , only one ( or a few ) nuclear spin(s ) becomes polarized and thus contributes to the signal . in the second step ,",
    "the nuclear spins are left to evolve freely for a time @xmath68 ( `` _ _ diffuse _ _ '' ) prior to transferring polarization back to the nv electronic spin for detection in the third step ( `` _ _ reverse sense _ _ '' ) . during the diffusion time @xmath68",
    ", nuclear polarization migrates to neighboring spins under the action of the homonuclear dipolar hamiltonian  @xcite . to sense the new location of the polarization the nv is again driven at the nuclear spin frequency ( alternating with the gradient field for enhanced spatial resolution ) . by omitting the initial rotation to the transverse plane ,",
    "the nv is now only sensitive to polarized nuclear spins . for a fixed diffusion time @xmath68 one thus obtain a 2d , correlated spectrum , similar to nmr 2d spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum ( figure  [ fig : simulation ] ) encodes information about the couplings between nuclear spins and thus constrains their relative positions .",
    "note that we could further obtain 3d spectra by sweeping the diffusion time @xmath68 ( si appendix ) .",
    "the spectra yield an over - constrained system for the spin positions , as for @xmath69 nuclear spins we can obtain up to @xmath70 equations ( si appendix ) . by using the polarized nuclear spins as probes of their own environment , this protocol can thus break the symmetry of the dipolar coupling and overcome the phase problem that plagues other experimental techniques .",
    ", scaledwidth=30.0% ]    indeed , the 1d nmr spectrum acquired in the first step provides information on the dipolar couplings to the nv spin .",
    "using a peak - picking procedure , we directly read out the longitudinal dipolar couplings from the frequency position @xmath71 of the dips , @xmath72 .",
    "the dip height determines the transverse coupling , as @xmath73 ( eq .",

    "the nuclear spin positions lie in a region defined by the unknown angle @xmath77 ( analogous to the phase problem in x - ray crystallography . )",
    "while the nv depth often further constrains this region , the information obtained from the 2d spectrum correlations is essential to unambiguously determine the position .",
    "in addition , 2d correlations help in distinguishing spins that might have similar couplings to the nv ( because of the phase symmetry ) and thus create overlapping signals in the 1d spectrum , but give rise to distinct peaks in the 2d spectra since they couple to different spins .    for an isolated nuclear spin pair ,",

    ", a 2d spectrum might not be sufficient to fully determine the position of a complex structure since couplings between distant nuclear spins might not be visible and because of uncertainties in the estimated parameters .",
    "the information can however be supplemented by 3d spectra ( varying the diffusion time ) and by including prior information , such as the length of chemical bonds , into the reconstruction algorithm .",
    "the proposed method would enable nv centers in diamond to sense individual nuclear spins and their mutual couplings with atomic - scale resolution and thereby determine the atomic structure of pockets and local sites close to the surface of large bio - molecules .",

    "the molecules could be functionalized and attached to the diamond surface , for example by methods such as the edc / nhs reaction , which forms a chemical bond stable over a few weeks  @xcite .",
    "deterministic binding near an nv center may be obtained using co - localization techniques developed in  @xcite .",

    "our method could complement information acquired via existing techniques , in particular x - ray crystallography and nmr . while x - ray diffraction is able to image whole proteins with angstrom resolution",
    ", the technique requires the ability to produce high quality single crystals of a few hundred of microns , thus restricting the number of proteins that can be studied ( e.g. , membrane proteins can not be crystallized ) ; in contrast , nv - based sensing can image single proteins in their natural state .",
    "in addition , the imaging protocol we propose can help solve reconstruction issues associated with the phase problem in x - ray diffraction and overcrowded spectra in nmr . while the nv - based scheme has similarities to nmr methods such as noesy  @xcite , which explore through - space spin - spin correlations , the ability of our nv technique to polarize only one spin at a time allows acquiring more information even in possibly crowded spectra .    we can estimate the resources needed for such tasks by considering the frequency resolution and signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) requirements to distinguish one or few nuclear spins in a dense molecule . for a nuclear spin on - resonance with the nv rabi frequency , the signal in eq .",

    "<S> nuclear spin imaging at the atomic level is essential for the understanding of fundamental biological phenomena and for applications such as drug discovery . </S>",
    "<S> the advent of novel nano - scale sensors has given hope of achieving the long - standing goal of single - protein , high spatial - resolution structure determination in their natural environment and ambient conditions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , quantum sensors based on the spin - dependent photoluminescence of nitrogen vacancy ( nv ) centers in diamond have recently been used to detect nanoscale ensembles of external nuclear spins . </S>",
    "<S> while nv sensitivity is approaching single - spin levels , extracting relevant information from a very complex structure is a further challenge , since it requires not only the ability to sense the magnetic field of an isolated nuclear spin , but also to achieve atomic - scale spatial resolution . </S>",
    "<S> here we propose a method that , by exploiting the coupling of the nv center to an intrinsic quantum memory associated with the nitrogen nuclear spin , can reach a tenfold improvement in spatial resolution , down to atomic scales . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial resolution enhancement is achieved through coherent control of the sensor spin , which creates a dynamic frequency filter selecting only a few nuclear spins at a time . </S>",
    "<S> we propose and analyze a protocol that would allow not only sensing individual spins in a complex biomolecule , but also unraveling couplings among them , thus elucidating local characteristics of the molecule structure .    </S>",
    "<S> proteins are the most important building blocks of life . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to obtain high - resolution protein structures is the keystone of drug discovery , since structure naturally reveals binding sites that can be targeted by drugs . </S>",
    "<S> several methods exist for determining high resolution protein structure , primarily x - ray crystallography  @xcite , transmission electron microscopy  @xcite and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while each method has greatly contributed to our understanding of protein structure , none of them can sense individual molecules . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest would be imaging of small active sites of a protein in its natural environment and conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , novel quantum sensors associated with the nitrogen vacancy ( nv ) center in diamond  @xcite have shown the potential to provide few nt@xmath0 sensing and nanoscale resolution at ambient conditions . </S>",
    "<S> nv - based magnetometers  @xcite can be transformative tools in quantum information , material science and bio - imaging  @xcite , allowing for example high - resolution magnetic imaging of living cells  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nv centers in bulk diamond have mapped the location of single @xmath1c nuclear spins inside the diamond crystal  @xcite , while shallow - implanted nvs have recently demonstrated the ability to sense a small number of nuclear spins in various organic materials  @xcite , as well as single and small ensembles of electronic spins outside the diamond sensor  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> each nuclear spin in samples of interest creates a magnetic field that depends on its position relative to the nv center . for spins 2 - 5 nm away from the nv </S>",
    "<S> spin , this magnetic field is within range of the sensitivity of the nv quantum probe  @xcite ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : nv - antenna].a ) , can be made possible by the long coherence time achieved by careful material preparation  @xcite and by using pulsed  @xcite or continuous  @xcite dynamical decoupling ( dd ) sequences , which can extend the sensing time to hundreds of microseconds . </S>",
    "<S> the decoupling cancels low - frequency dephasing noise , but by appropriately selecting the control timing to match the nuclear spin larmor frequency , the nv spin can sense the magnetic field created by the nuclear spins , even in the absence of a net nuclear polarization ( spin noise ) . for sparse nuclear spin ensembles , such as encountered in natural diamond , </S>",
    "<S> this effect is enough to distinguish individual spins and thus to reconstruct their position  @xcite . for dense samples , </S>",
    "<S> the frequency resolution is inadequate to distinguish individual spins . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the intrinsic nmr linewidth in a dense molecule might exceed the nv sensing linewidth .    in the following </S>",
    "<S> we describe a method to improve the frequency , hence spatial , resolution of nv sensing . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the method performance with simulations on typical bio - molecules and discuss the experimental resources needed to achieve atomic - scale reconstruction of nuclear spin positions .    </S>",
    "<S> c  ( spheres with color scale given by @xmath2 ) is in the range of nt , within reach of nv sensitivity . in the inset : the binding site of interest ( atoms other than @xmath1c  are blue ( o ) and red ( n ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) a shallow nv center ( 2 nm from the surface ) creates a magnetic field gradient ( @xmath3 ) above the [ 111 ] surface of the diamond . note the azimuthal symmetry of the field , which causes degeneracy of the frequency shift at many spatial locations . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : nv - antenna],scaledwidth=45.0% ]      we assume that the biomolecule to be probed is attached to the surface of a diamond at the location of a single nv center that is within 3 nm of the diamond surface ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : nv - antenna ] ) . to achieve enhanced spatial resolution for nv sensing of the nuclear spins within the biomolecule </S>",
    "<S> , we use three critical ingredients : ( i ) an effective strong magnetic field gradient across the biomolecule due , e.g. , to the rapid spatial variation of the magnetic dipolar field from the nv electronic spin ; ( ii ) hamiltonian engineering of the nv and multi - nuclear spin system  @xcite  which creates a very sharp dynamical frequency filter for nv sensing and controls the effect of nv spin polarization leakage through the coupled nuclear spin network ; and ( iii ) a quantum memory  the _ nuclear _ @xmath4n spin associated with the nv center  which enables long acquisition times and hence an even sharper frequency filter .    the sensing protocol works by following the leakage of polarization from the nv center ( which is optically polarized ) toward on - resonance nuclear spins . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance condition is in principle different for each nuclear spin , as it is given by its position - dependent coupling to the nv center . </S>",
    "<S> however , simply implementing cross - polarization does not yield enough frequency resolution for single - spin sensing . by alternating periods of cross - polarization with evolution under a magnetic field gradient while the nv spin state </S>",
    "<S> is preserved by mapping onto the quantum memory the interaction hamiltonian is modulated and only couplings of the nv to resonant nuclear spins are retained . </S>",
    "<S> evolution under the gradient thus acts as a sharp frequency filter , thereby increasing the spatial selectivity . </S>",
    "<S> the gradient evolution time can be long , limited only by the quantum memory ( the _ nuclear _ @xmath4n spin associated with the nv center ) coherence time , which at a few milliseconds translates to a high frequency resolution , @xmath5hz .    using the nv polarization leakage as a signature of the nuclear spin position provides two advantages over measurement of nv frequency shifts due to specific nuclear spins . </S>",
    "<S> first , it is easy to embed nuclear decoupling sequences within the sensing protocol ; nuclear decoupling is essential to narrow the nmr spectrum intrinsic linewidth and thus detect signal arising from individual nuclear spins . </S>",
    "<S> second , once the polarization is transferred to a nuclear spin , this spin itself becomes a sensitive probe of its local environment . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we propose a three - step protocol for nuclear spin imaging . in a first step , </S>",
    "<S> we observe polarization transfer from the nv center to one ( or a few ) nuclear spin(s ) , providing partial information about their positions . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear spins can then evolve freely , and polarization diffuses in the nuclear spin network . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization is then transferred back to the nv center , revealing the nuclear spin connectivity . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus acquire multi - dimensional spectra that not only decrease frequency crowding , but can also resolve degeneracies related to the intrinsic symmetry of the dipolar coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> next we describe in detail the proposed method and its application to biomolecule structure reconstruction . </S>"
