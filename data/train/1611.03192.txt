    "one of the most fundamental phenomena in physics is energy and particle exchange between systems , which occur in the form of heat and mass current in the presence of temperature and chemical potential gradient .",
    "it is often our interest to understand steady state ( ss ) with constant exchange rate .",
    "a great deal of research have been performed to clarify the properties of ss , such as landauer - bttiker ( lb ) formula for fermionic particle current  @xcite , onsager s reciprocal relation in the linear response regime  @xcite , and thermoelectric effect  @xcite .",
    "also in modern formulation of stochastic thermodynamics , steady state fluctuation theorem explains the directionality of the flow as a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics  @xcite , and proves symmetry relations between nonlinear response coefficients  @xcite .",
    "in fact , decay from an initial transient state into ss usually occurs if a system is subject to a dissipation due to a coupling to an environment  @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies show that types of dissipation processes  @xcite and the presence of bound state  @xcite are crucial for the formation of ss .",
    "numerical tools have been developed to examine how an open quantum system to reach ss  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that ss can also exist in a quantum system isolated from dissipative environment if the system itself is infinite to have continuum energy spectra .",
    "elementary but illuminating example is fermi s golden rule for the constant transition rate in a system having continuous density of states  @xcite .    as for ss in isolated quantum systems , despite the very fact that quantum systems are not infinite in their size , we presume that if the energy levels of considered systems are spaced densely enough , ss would also be established in a very similar manner to infinite systems . in this regard , the assumption of infinite size or continuum energy levels seems only a matter of mathematical convenience .",
    "however , it is obvious that the exchange rate between two finite systems can not be constant perpetually .",
    "if so , we reach an unphysical situation , for example , that particles flow constantly from system a to system b even if system a is totally evacuated . furthermore , finite quantum systems evolving according to time symmetric schrdinger equation can not reach ss in the strict sense .",
    "hence the behavior of ss predicted for infinite systems should cease to persist after a certain time scale @xmath0 .",
    "the following questions arise .",
    "what determines @xmath0 ?",
    "what are the subsequent states for a time longer than @xmath0 ? does any alternative form of ss emerge , which can not be explained by existing theories for infinite systems ?",
