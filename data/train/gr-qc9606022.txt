    "there are two steps from the einstein equations to a numerical code for solving them : first one selects the fields of the problem ( the metric , its derivatives , connection coefficients etc . ) and a subset of the einstein equations to evolve these from some boundary conditions .",
    "this constitutes the `` differential problem '' .",
    "the resulting set of differential equations is then transformed into a set of difference equations on a numerical grid , constituting the `` difference problem '' .",
    "( here the term `` boundaries '' includes spacelike and null as well as timelike boundaries . )    in the first step , one distinguishes between `` free '' and `` constrained '' evolution schemes . in a free evolution scheme ,",
    "the constraints are imposed only at the boundaries , and all fields are propagated by means of the evolution equations . in a constrained scheme , one uses fewer evolution equations , and instead reconstructs some fields at each time step from the constraints .",
    "( here the term `` time '' refers to the coordinate that labels slices in the numerical evolution , which can be null .",
    "constraints are all equations restricted to a hypersurface . )    in this paper we show that free evolution may already be ill - posed as a differential problem in some cases because it admits exponentially growing perturbations which are solutions of the evolution equations , but which violate the constraints and are therefore unphysical . for analytic purposes",
    "this does not matter , as imposing the constraints on the boundaries assures that they are obeyed everywhere , but any finite - differencing scheme introduces small perturbations which do not generically obey the constraints , and serve as initial data for the growing unphysical modes .",
    "the amplitude of these modes depends therefore on the choice of difference scheme ( and decreases with the grid spacing ) , but their evolution ( for example , the rate of exponential blow - up ) is determined by the differential problem alone .    as an example differential problem we consider free evolution in spherical symmetry in double null coordinates .",
    "it is sufficiently simple that we can calculate the blowup of the unstable mode analytically , before confirming it in a testbed calculation .",
    "this particular instability is a serious problem inside and just outside black holes , harmless far outside black holes , and is not present in perturbations around flat spacetime .",
    "the metric of any spherically symmetric spacetime can be written as @xmath0 where the metric coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 depend on @xmath3 and @xmath4 only . our matter will be a minimally coupled massless real scalar field @xmath5 , plus a spherically symmetric maxwell field . the maxwell field has no sources , and",
    "is therefore constrained to be a pure coulomb field of constant charge @xmath6 anchored at ( the singularity ) @xmath7 .",
    "this model has been used in both analytic @xcite and numerical @xcite work as a toy model for studying the interior of realistic black holes .",
    "realistic black holes should be spinning , at least slightly , and would therefore be expected to have a cauchy horizon , like the kerr solution . on the other hand",
    "they would be inevitably perturbed by gravitational wave tails , and these perturbations would blow up on the cauchy horizon .",
    "what really happens has therefore been the subject of prolonged investigation .",
    "replacing the rotation by an electric charge and gravitational waves by the scalar field allows the simplification of spherical symmetry .",
    "although we have chosen a particular matter model here , we shall see that the instability arises in the gravitational part of the equations and is therefore independent of the matter model .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 components of the einstein equations are @xmath10 the @xmath11 component is @xmath12 and the @xmath13 component is @xmath14 the other components of the einstein equations are redundant .",
    "the massless wave equation for @xmath5 , restricted to spherical symmetry , is @xmath15 we then have three hyperbolic equations @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 and two elliptic equations @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "( the elliptic equations are really ordinary differential equations because of the spherical symmetry . )",
    "the elliptic equations are propagated by the hyperbolic equations in the sense of @xmath21 while a similar equation holds for @xmath22 .",
    "a possible evolution scheme , perhaps the most natural one , and certainly one easy to implement numerically , is to consider the three hyperbolic equations as evolution equations for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath5 , and the elliptic equations as constraints which are imposed only on the boundary .",
    "the natural initial value problem for these equations , is a double null initial value problem . @xmath2",
    ", @xmath1 and @xmath5 are given as functions of @xmath3 on the null cone @xmath23 , subject to the constraint @xmath24 , and as functions of @xmath4 on the intersecting null cone @xmath25 , subject to the constraint @xmath26 .",
    "at the intersection point @xmath27 it is sufficient that the data @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 be continuous . in the free evolution scheme ,",
    "the constraints are imposed only on the null boundary data , but are not used for the numerical solution inside the numerical domain .",
    "we now examine the stability of this free evolution scheme in the context of black hole physics . as a testbed case we use the reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "it is the unique solution for @xmath28 , and it is known in double null coordinates in ( essentially ) closed form . in one particular gauge choice ( eddington - finkelstein coordinates ) this solution is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is given implicitly by @xmath31 the implicit equation @xmath32 can be solved numerically to arbitrary precision so that the solution exists in closed form for all numerical purposes .",
    "in our test case we have set @xmath28 because we expect a nonvanishing @xmath5 to give rise to a physical instability , namely mass inflation , inside the black hole , while we want to check if such instabilities are already contained in the free evolution scheme in a situation when we know that no physical instabilities can be present .    in order to look for instabilities in analytic approximation , it is useful to make a change of variables in order to eliminate first derivatives in the hyperbolic equations . with the new variables",
    "@xmath33 the evolution equations @xmath34 and @xmath35 , now restricted to @xmath28 , become @xmath36 ( the evolution equation @xmath37 for @xmath5 is dropped . ) the constraints @xmath24 and @xmath26 become @xmath38 now we linearize the evolution equations , denoting the perturbations of @xmath39 and @xmath40 by @xmath41 and @xmath42 : @xmath43 the coefficients of these equations on the reissner - nordstrm background are @xmath44    to obtain an analytic approximation to the perturbations we now consider @xmath2 and @xmath1 of the background as slowly varying functions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we make a mode ansatz @xmath45 the ansatz turns the derivative @xmath46 into the algebraic expression @xmath47 , and the equations ( [ pert ] ) into the local dispersion relation @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath49 are the eigenvalues of the two - by - two matrix @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "their value on the reissner - nordstrm background is @xmath51 , \\quad { \\rm where } \\quad \\rho\\equiv q^2/r^2,\\ ] ] and the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath52 are @xmath53    with @xmath3 and @xmath4 both increasing to the future .",
    "@xmath54 labels time , and @xmath55 labels space .",
    "@xmath54 increases away from the null boundary data .",
    "( inside the black hole , evolution towards increasing @xmath54 is also evolution towards the singularity . )",
    "therefore we have an instability if @xmath56 is negative for any @xmath57 , that is , for @xmath58 .",
    "we see that for @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "although @xmath1 changes sign at the horizons , one of the @xmath61 is always negative for all @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath62 the situation is not changed drastically .",
    "there is now a region where both @xmath61 are positive , namely @xmath63 ) of the metric invariant are @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are arbitrary functions .",
    "the speed of the exponential blowup itself is gauge - invariant , in the sense that @xmath61 transforms correctly under the coordinate transformations @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we can see this noting , from ( [ metric ] ) , that @xmath1 transforms in the same way as @xmath68 for any scalar @xmath69 , and that @xmath61 is the product of @xmath1 times a scalar ( @xmath2 is a scalar ) , and hence also transforms like @xmath1 .",
    "our results would therefore also hold in kruskal coordinates , or any other double null coordinates .",
    "we should stress again that the unstable perturbations we have constructed are not tied to a particular numerical scheme .",
    "they are solutions to the hyperbolic part of the einstein equations .",
    "they must arise in any numerical algorithm implementing a free evolution scheme in null coordinates , simply because they are excited by the discretisation error of any numerical scheme .",
    "of course these unstable modes are not solutions of the constraints , or elliptic part of the einstein equations .",
    "we can explicitly verify this by constructing the perturbations that do obey the constraints .",
    "the linearized constraints are @xmath70 because the reissner - nordstrm solution is unique , any perturbations of ( [ rn1],[rn2 ] ) obeying all the einstein equations must be infinitesimal coordinate transformations .",
    "perturbatively we write @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the corresponding perturbative changes in the metric variables are @xmath73 clearly these obey the linear constraints and are bounded .",
    "the unstable modes we have given do not obey the linear constraints and blow up .",
    "we first encountered this instability in a code modeled on that of reference @xcite , when we found we were unable to recover the reissner - nordstrm solution in a testbed .",
    "having constructed the unstable modes analytically , we could quantitatively verify their presence in the code .",
    "( once more it should be said that the instability is connected to the free evolution scheme , not to any particular numerical implementation . ) as an example we numerically construct a null diamond ( that is , a square in @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) of the schwarzschild solution centered on @xmath74 .",
    "( we have chosen @xmath75 because there the instability is greatest outside the horizon . )",
    "1 shows the numerical setup . at @xmath74 in the coordinates ( [ rn1],[rn2 ] ) ,",
    "this corresponds to a blowup of the unstable modes as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the usual schwarzschild time coordinate .",
    "numerically we find that the error grows as @xmath79 at @xmath74 .",
    "the discrepancy of the exponent may be due to the approximation of constant @xmath2 and @xmath1 we have made in the analytic calculation .",
    "there is a second prediction of the analytic model which can be verified at least qualitatively . from the form of the eigenvectors ( [ eigvec ] ) , together with the definitions ( [ new ] ) it follows that the relative error in @xmath1 is generically of the same order as the relative error in @xmath2 , except for @xmath80 , where it will much greater ( because @xmath81 ) .",
    "this feature is confirmed by numerical evolutions inside and outside the horizon , for various values of @xmath6 .",
    "we have given a simple clean example of a numerical instability arising from constraint violation .",
    "the amplitude of the unstable mode depends on the discretisation scheme , but its growth rate does not .",
    "we have estimated the growth rate analytically , and have confirmed it for a particular discretisation .",
    "the free evolution scheme we have described was used for the numerical study of perturbed reissner - nordstrm black holes in reference @xcite .",
    "as our investigation shows , this scheme is unable even to evolve the exact reissner - nordstrm solution ( setting the scalar field to zero ) because of an exponential instability eventually crashing the code .",
    "it can therefore not be used for the study of the physical instability triggered by small physical perturbations .",
    "( this is the physical instability @xcite predicted to lead to mass inflation and the destruction of the cauchy horizon . )",
    "this casts a shadow on the physical results obtained using this scheme .",
    "other published codes @xcite using a double null numerical grid use fully constrained evolution .",
    "the interior of a charged black hole has been treated with a fully constrained evolution scheme based on coordinates @xmath3 ( retarded time ) and @xmath2 ( curvature radius ) , but evolving them on a double null grid @xcite .",
    "this kind of algorithm has been pioneered in @xcite , and has been used extensively since @xcite .",
    "a code actually based on double null coordinates , as well as a null grid , was used in @xcite , implementing a fully constrained scheme .",
    "here fully constrained means that one uses the maximum number of equations containing only @xmath4-derivatives .",
    "another instance of an ill - posedness and instability arising from constraint violation has been found for the nonlinear evolution of weak gravitational waves on a flat background @xcite .",
    "the growth rate of the instability depended on the discretisation scheme , however , which is puzzling in the light of our results .",
    "generally our results suggest that free evolution schemes are generally harder ( or impossible , as in this case ) to make stable than fully constrained schemes .",
    "this is not in conflict with the statement @xcite that if one if one evolves in free evolution to a certain order in the grid spacing , the constraints are automatically obeyed to that order .",
    "the numerical , constraint - violating , error may go down as some power of decreasing step - size , but it can also be growing exponentially with time .",
    "if this exponential growth is fast enough , one will , in typical situations , be unable in practice to compensate for the error at late times by using a finer numerical grid .",
    "enforcing all the constraints at each time step can avoid a blowup only when the solution to be calculated is itself insensitive to small perturbations in the initial data , because then all rapidly growing perturbations must be constraint violations .",
    "the solution itself however may be highly sensitive to perturbations in the initial data , and/or may blow up at a spacetime singularity .",
    "examples of such physical instabilities are mass inflation in the perturbed black holes we discussed here , the threshold of black hole formation , or chaos in the mixmaster universe @xcite",
    ". such examples may not be strictly well - posed but are nevertheless interesting .",
    "then one must enforce the constraints to distinguish physical from unphysical ( constraint - violating ) perturbations .",
