    "+ we have identified macroscopic quantities , i.e. mass of the tumor and its radius , which can be exploited in a comparison with experimental or clinical data .",
    "most of the considerations contained in our paper , rely upon an evolution model based on the verhulst equation or on its modified forms .",
    "such a procedure is not new and , even though the literature in the field is considerable and authoritative and the assumptions underlying the models are convincing and well - motivated @xcite , we believe that all of them exhibit significant limitations , if viewed as tools to analyze the experimental data .",
    "these models are all leading to the same mechanisms ( growth and saturation ) and differ only for some specific parameter ( like the @xmath15 exponent in the kleiber law ) , but , at least with regards to the analysis of the data , there is no clear evidence guiding the selection of one model versus the other .",
    "they are characterized by an s - shaped evolution of the cancer mass and , from the empirical point of view , they are all equivalent .",
    "the various curves can indeed be mapped onto each other , by suitable rescaling of the parameters , thus hiding other effects , as shown in the following example .",
    "+ the dormant pre - angiogenic phase or cell quiescence , induced by necrotic hypoxic signals and/or by systemic treatment , rely on a largely unknown phenomenology , which can be accounted for in the evolution model only on the basis of ad hoc assumptions .",
    "as already stressed , when the tumor undergoes the pre - angiogenetic and angiogenetic phases , it exhibits different growth behaviors .",
    "the evolution rate becomes exponential , as the number of cells increases .",
    "we can therefore introduce an empirical parameter ( the critical mass @xmath193 associated e.g. with the largest mass compatible with an avascular growth ) , controlling this effect .",
    "accordingly , we modify the verhulst equation as follows @xcite      the growth rate is modulated by the tumor mass itself and tends to approximate the constant value @xmath195 when @xmath196 , on the contrary when @xmath196 the growth rate is significantly smaller .",
    "we expect therefore that the cancer mass evolution will take a larger amount of time to emerge from the initial latency stage to start its growth at an exponential rate . in fig .",
    "[ evolrappdiff ] we have reported the mass evolution predicted by eq . [ vermc ] for the ordinary verhulst case while , for the case @xmath197 with @xmath198 , the curve exhibit an almost identical behavior , even though shifted in time .",
    "albeit such a time delay is expected , the use of one form or the other for the analysis of the data is not significant .",
    "the two curves can indeed be exactly overlapped after choosing different initial conditions .",
    "it is therefore evident that an increase of the latency time induced by a mechanism of this type could be inferred from the analysis of the experimental data only when initial conditions are well defined and this requires a very accurate control of the experimental conditions .",
    "+     growth vs. time @xmath199 for the ordinary verhulst and its modified form as reported in equation [ vermc ] ; the graphs are obtained imposing the initial condition value ( @xmath200 ) equal to @xmath201 and with two different values for @xmath202 parameter : @xmath203 for dashed line and @xmath204 for continuous line . ]    the increase of the vascular feeding efficiency ( associated with vascular sprouting and the consequent ability of the tumor to feed its cells more efficiently ) may be even more effective and elude ( within certain limits ) the saturation mechanisms , by shifting the threshold of the on - set of the non - linearity .",
    "in other words it can be assumed that , when the mass increases , the system becomes capable of recruiting resources , thus acting as if the carrying capacity of the environment were increased by the growth of the tumor mass itself .",
    "+ such an effect is reminiscent of an analogous mechanism in social sciences regarding the human ( population ) evolution .",
    "that is , the carrying capacity of the ecological environment feeding humans seems to display a dynamical evolution , increasing with the population size itself .",
    "+ the model , first proposed on the eve of the last century by cohen @xcite , assumes that the population growth is ruled by the following modified verhulst equation @xmath205 in principle , this description could be used to model cancer cell evolution , by including new feeding strategies associated with vascularization and optimization of the resource recruiting mechanisms , through a dynamical tuning of the vascularweb architecture .",
    "+ the use of equation ( 43 ) does not imply a departure from the logistic behavior , but only a shift in the saturation threshold , leaving unaffected the growth rate . + in this case",
    "too there is no way of selecting the effect from the analysis of the data of cancer mass evolution .",
    "both curves can indeed be interpolated with a verhulst function differing only in the value of the saturated mass .",
    "+ the same model can be adopted ( just by reversing the sign of @xmath127 ) to study effects induced by starvation of the tumor mass @xcite therapy - induced or else .",
    "+ next , in fig .",
    "[ cnfrcurve ] we have therefore reported the result relevant to the evolution of cancer cells subject to different type of treatment @xcite .",
    "the red line refers to the untreated evolution , while the others report the response to different treatments : immunotherapy ( blue ) , chemotherapy ( green ) , and a combination of both ( black ) . without focussing on the specific details we see that by assuming that the equation modelling the mass ( number of cells ) evolution is provided by eq .",
    "[ cohen ] , we can reproduce the same behavior after an appropriate choice of the parameter @xmath127 .",
    "+ it is also worth noting that in the case of the green and black curves , a decrease of the malignant cell population follows the plateau phase ; this effect too can be easily included in the model , as we will show elsewhere .",
    "the verhulst evolution equation can be modified ad libitum , but it is our opinion , that no substantial improvement in our understanding of tumor behavior will be obtained through this modification strategy , if not implemented along the lines also discussed in @xcite .",
    "+ arguably , the fractal nature of the capillary network in cancer is a main element of the cancer s survival strategy .",
    "+ furthermore , the distinction between primary and secondary tumors is perhaps inadequate . the fact that the cancer system sheds metastatic colonies at very early stages suggests that it develops relatively long term survival schemes , which are not only the consequence of subsistence needs due to environmental energetic crises .",
    "+ rather , the colonies may indeed stay dormant until the `` primary '' component is treated with radiation or chemo - therapies or is surgically removed @xcite .",
    "sometime the impression one gets from this behavior is that of a coherent system well integrated with the rest of the body .",
    "+ we have stressed that the tumor undergoes the pre - angiogenetic and angiogenetic phases in which it exhibits different growth behaviors and becomes more efficient in finding energetic resources to increase its mass .",
    "the success of the vascularization strategy stems from the `` redundancy '' of the process itself , namely from its ability of finding different capillary web structures , which arguably is also the key tool to shield it from the impact of angio - genetic drugs @xcite .",
    "the ability of the cancer mass to establish advantageous links with the rest of the environment is somehow similar to what happens in the evolution of different types of populations or aggregates @xcite , based on allometry and agglomeration , size distribution and gravitational interaction .",
    "+ allometry is indeed a manifestation of the fractal nature of the geometry underlying the process , which governs the size .",
    "the gravitational interaction @xcite is a concept borrowed from the physical language to model interaction between aggregates depending on their size and distance .",
    "+ geometry is an important , albeit scarcely considered , element in cancer evolution .",
    "the fractal nature of the process regulates the associated diffusion mechanisms , which can not be modelled using ordinary diffusive equations of the heat type ( albeit non - linear ) .",
    "we have emphasized the centrality of a levy type process in cancer spreading and the fact that the relevant dynamics are regulated by fractional fisher equations , in which the non - integer coefficient specifying the order of the involved derivatives is linked to the fractal exponent of the various scaling relations ( such as kleiber ) involved in the macroscopic process that rules the evolution equation of the wbe type .",
    "+ the emergency of necrotic cores in tumors is still a fact of noticeable importance @xcite for its evolution strategy , but also the indication of a misconception of the associated geometrical structure .",
    "the topological idea we have in mind is that of a sphere and the core of the tumor is at center of this sphere .",
    "we have already stressed that the pathway of tumor expansion and capillary elongation occurs in opposite direction , but probably the geometrical concept of a center should be replaced with the `` center '' of energetic resources which lies outside the core of the tumor itself .",
    "+ this is not surprising , since increasing evidence suggests that many tumors are governed by the signals they receive from the microenvironment including the immune system cells . as such , cancer evolution and the aggressiveness of its metastasis is the result of the interaction with signals inside and outside the tumor @xcite . and as such , hosting organ physiology and tumor should not be considered as separated entities .",
    "+ the last point of the analogy is what we have called gravitational interaction .",
    "a major interest is to better understand the interaction between the primary and secondary tumors which appears rather active and , as already stressed , dormant colonies become active when the main tumor is treated @xcite .",
    "+ we have here touched upon several central questions in cancer growth and disseminations and , supported by medical findings reported in the literature , have presented a set of innovative theoretical arguments .",
