    "a recent trend in the area of literature mining is the inclusion of images in the form of figures from biomedical publications @xcite .",
    "this development benefits from the fact that an increasing number of scientific articles are published as open access publications .",
    "this means that not just the abstracts but the complete texts including images are available for data analysis . among other things , this enabled the development of query engines for biomedical images like the yale image finder @xcite and the biotext search engine @xcite",
    "below , we present our approach to detect and access gel diagrams .",
    "this is an extended version of a previous workshop paper @xcite .    as a preparatory evaluation to decide which image type to focus on",
    ", we built a corpus of 3000 figures that allows us to reliably estimate the numbers and types of images in biomedical articles .",
    "these figures were drawn randomly from the open access subset of pubmed central and then manually annotated .",
    "they were split into subfigures when the figure consisted of several components .",
    "figure [ fig : categories ] shows the resulting categories and subcategories .",
    "this classification scheme is based on five basic image categories : experimental / microscopy , graph , diagram , clinical and picture , each divided into multiple subcategories .",
    "it shows that bar graphs ( 12.4% ) , black - on - white gels ( 12.0% ) , fluorescence microscopy images ( 9.4% ) , and line graphs ( 8.1% ) are the most frequent subfigure types ( all percentages are relative to the entire set of images ) .",
    "we targeted different kinds of graphs ( i.e. , diagrams with axes ) in previous work @xcite , and we decided to focus this work on the second most common type of images : gel diagrams .",
    "they are the result of gel electrophoresis , which is a common method to analyze dna , rna and proteins .",
    "southern , western and northern blotting @xcite are among the most common applications of gel electrophoresis .",
    "the resulting experimental artifacts are often shown in biomedical publications in the form of gel images as evidence for the discussed findings such as protein - protein interactions or protein expressions under different conditions .",
    "often , not all details of the results shown in these images are explicitly stated in the caption or the article text . for these reasons , it would be of high value to be able to reliably mine the relations encoded in these images .    a closer look at gel images reveals that they follow regular patterns to encode their semantic relations .",
    "figure [ fig : example ] shows two typical examples of gel images together with a table representation of the involved relations .",
    "the ultimate objective of our approach ( for which we can only present a partial solution here ) is to automatically extract at least some of these relations from the respective images , possibly in conjunction with classical text mining techniques .",
    "the first example shows a western blot for detecting two proteins ( 14 - 3 - 3@xmath0 and @xmath1-actin as a control ) in four different cell lines ( mda - mb-231 , nhem , c8161.9 , and lox , the first of which is used as a control ) .",
    "there are two rectangular gel segments arranged in a way to form a @xmath2 grid for the individual eight measurements combining each protein with each cell line .",
    "a gel diagram can be considered a kind of matrix with pictures of experimental artifacts as content .",
    "the tables to the right illustrate the semantic relations encoded in the gel diagrams .",
    "each relation instance consists of a condition , a measurement and a result .",
    "the proteins are the entities being measured under the conditions of the different cell lines .",
    "the result is a certain degree of expression indicated by the darkness of the spots ( or brightness in the case of white - on - black gels ) .",
    "the second example is a slightly more complex one .",
    "several proteins are tested against each other in a way that involves more than two dimensions . in this case , the use of `` + '' and ``  '' labels is a frequent technique to denote the different possible combinations of a number of conditions .",
    "apart from that , the principles are the same . in this case",
    ", however , the number of relations is much larger .",
    "only the first eight of a total of 32 relation instances are shown in the table to the right . in such cases",
    ", the text rarely mentions all these relations in an explicit way , and the image is therefore the only accessible source .",
    "rl    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     although there is certainly much room for improvement , this simple gene detection step seems to perform reasonably well .",
    "for the last step , relation extraction , we can not present any concrete results at this point . after recognizing the named entities",
    ", we would have to disambiguate them , identify their semantic roles ( condition , measurement or something else ) , align the gel images with the labels , and ultimately quantify the degree of expression . to improve the quality of the results ,",
    "combinations with classical text mining techniques should be considered .",
    "this is all future work .",
    "we expect to be able to profit to a large extent from existing work to disambiguate protein and gene names @xcite and to detect and analyze gel spots ( see the existing work mentioned above ) .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that these results can be combined with existing techniques of term disambiguation and gel spot detection at a satisfactory level of accuracy .",
    "we plan to investigate this in future work .",
    "as mentioned above , we have started to investigate how the gel segment detection step could be improved by the use of the image recognition technique of convolutional networks ( convnet ) @xcite .",
    "we started with a simplified approach to the one presented in @xcite . in this approach",
    ", images are tiled into small quadratic pieces .",
    "we used a single network ( and not several parallel networks ) , based on @xmath3 input tile images with three layers of convolutions .",
    "the first layer takes eight @xmath4 convolutions and is followed by a @xmath5 sub - sampling .",
    "the second layer takes twenty four @xmath4 convolutions and is followed by a @xmath6 sub - sampling .",
    "the last layer takes seventy two @xmath7 convolutions , which leads to a fully connected layer .",
    "we trained our convnet on the 500 images of the training set , where we manually annotated the tiles as _ gel _ and _ non - gel_. with the use of eblearn @xcite , this trained convnet classified the tiles of the 500 images of our testing set .",
    "the classified tiles can then be reconstructed into a mask image , as shown in figure [ fig : convnet ] .",
    "a manual check of the clusters of recognized gel tiles led to the results shown in table [ tab : geldetection ] .",
    "recall is very good ( 95% ) but precision is very poor ( 14% ) , leading to an f - score of 25% .",
    "this is much worse than the results we got with our random forest approach , which is why convnet is currently not part of our pipeline .",
    "we hope , however , that we can further optimize this convnet approach and combine it with random forests to exploit their ( hopefully ) complementary benefits .",
    "using convnet to classify complete images as _ gel - image _ or _ non - gel - image _ and adjusting the classification to account for unbalanced classes , we were able to obtain an f - score of 74% , which makes us confident that a combination of the two approaches could lead to a significant improvement of our gel segment detection step .",
    "as an alternative approach , we will try to run convnet on down - scaled entire panels rather than small tiles , as described in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we will experiment with parallel networks instead of single ones to improve accuracy .",
    "the results obtained from our gel recognition pipeline indicate that it is feasible to extract relations from gel images , but it is clear that this procedure is far from perfect .",
    "the automatic analysis of bitmap images seems to be the only efficient way to extract such relations from existing publications , but other publishing techniques should be considered for the future .",
    "the use of vector graphics instead of bitmaps would already greatly improve any subsequent attempts of automatic analysis .",
    "a further improvement would be to establish accepted standards for different types of biomedical diagrams in the spirit of the unified modeling language , a graphical language widely applied in software engineering since the 1990s .",
    "ideally , the resulting images could directly include semantic relations in a formal notation , which would make relation mining a trivial procedure .",
    "if authors are supported by good tools to draw diagrams like gel images , this approach could turn out to be feasible even in the near future .    concretely",
    ", we would like to take the opportunity to postulate the following actions , which we think should be carried out to make the content of images in biomedical articles more accessible :    * * stop pressing diagrams into bitmaps ! * unless the image only consists of one single photograph , screenshot , or another kind of picture that only has bitmap representation , vector graphics should be used for article figures . * * let data and metadata travel from the tools that generate diagrams to the final articles !",
    "* whenever the specific tool that is used to generate the diagram `` knows '' that a certain graphical element refers to an organism , a gene , an interaction , a point in time , or another kind of entity , then this information should be stored in the image file , passed on , and finally published with the article .",
    "* * use rdf vocabularies to embed semantic annotations in diagrams !",
    "* tools for creating scientific diagrams should use rdf notation and stick to existing standardized schemas ( or define new ones if required ) to annotate the diagram files they create . * * define standards for scientific diagrams ! * in the spirit of the unified modeling language , the biomedical community should come up with standards that define the appearance and meaning of different types of diagrams .",
    "obviously , different groups of people need to be involved in these actions , namely article authors , journal editors , and tool developers .",
    "it is relatively inexpensive to follow these postulates ( though it might require some time ) , which in turn would greatly improve data sharing , image mining , and scientific communication in general .",
    "standardized diagrams could be the long sought solution to the problem of how to let authors publish computer - processable formal representations for ( part of ) their results .",
    "this can build upon the efforts of establishing an open annotation model @xcite .",
    "successful image mining from gel diagrams in biomedical publications would unlock a large amount of valuable data .",
    "our results show that gel panels and their labels can be detected with high accuracy , applying machine learning techniques and hand - coded rules .",
    "we also showed that genes and proteins can be detected in the gel labels with satisfactory precision .    based on these results",
    ", we believe that this kind of image mining is a promising and viable approach to provide more powerful query interfaces for researchers , to gather relations such as protein - protein interactions , and to generally complement existing text mining approaches . at the same time",
    ", we believe that an effort towards standardization of scientific diagrams such as gel images would greatly improve the efficiency and precision of image mining at relatively low additional costs at the time of publication .",
    "the authors declare that they have no competing interests .",
