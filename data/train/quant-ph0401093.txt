    "there exist several definitions of states ( cs ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "they lead to the same result for the harmonic oscillator potential and usually to different results for other physical systems .",
    "nevertheless , a careful analysis shows that they possesses common properties which can be taken to define cs for the very general quantum system @xcite .",
    "it happens that such a definition is very ambiguous",
    ". therefore one can choose between different possible systems the one which has a desirable property .",
    "for instance , one can look for a state , the wave function of which can be expressed in terms of known special functions or even in terms of elementary functions only .",
    "this simplifies considerably the study of these cs and their use in other applications . in this way one",
    "was able to construct different systems of cs for the well - known soliton potentials @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that different cs may be related between them with a symmetry operator @xcite or with the laplace transform @xcite .",
    "the most essential progress in studying cs has been achieved for systems possessing symmetries @xcite .",
    "if it is not possible to associate a symmetry group with a quantum system the problem becomes much more complicated .",
    "for instance , after applying a nontrivial supersymmetric ( or equivalently darboux ) transformation to a hamiltonian allowing a symmetry , the symmetry is usually lost or it is transformed to a nonlinear symmetry @xcite .",
    "this makes impossible to apply group theoretical methods for studying cs . in this respect",
    "it was suggested to apply the same transformation to the known cs of the initial quantum system and treat states thus obtained as coherent states for the transformed system @xcite .",
    "this approach proved to be useful for studying cs for supersymmetrically transformed harmonic oscillator @xcite and time - independent singular oscillator @xcite potentials .",
    "in particular , using correspondence between classical and quantum systems , which can be realized just by the technique of cs ( see e.g. @xcite ) , one was able to give an interpretation of the supersymmetry transformation in terms of classical notions @xcite .",
    "here we continue this study at the level of the time - dependent singular oscillator .    the time - dependent singular oscillator hamiltonian [ h0 ] h_0=-_x^2+^2(t)x^2+gx^-2 plays an essential role in different physical applications between which we would like to mention interesting results in molecular physics @xcite , in optics @xcite and in mathematical physics @xcite .",
    "recently a model of a two - ion trap has been proposed ( see @xcite where a good literature review is also given ) based on this hamiltonian .",
    "exact solvability of the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) may be , in particular , related with the fact that the symmetry operators realize a representation of the @xmath0 algebra and therefore it can be solved by the method of separation of variables @xcite .",
    "moreover , for this algebra two systems of cs are commonly known @xcite .",
    "the one may be obtained with the help of the @xmath1 group translation operator ( they are known as perelomov cs , see e.g. @xcite ) and the other are eigenstates of the annihilation operator @xcite ( barut - girardelo cs @xcite ) . here",
    "we will study the supersymmetric transformation of either system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section to fix the notations",
    "we give a review of some properties of the singular oscillator hamiltonian and its cs .",
    "in particular , basing on the barut - girardello cs we construct a holomorphic representation of state functions and operators ; for a concrete example of a free particle moving with a fixed value of the angular momentum equal to two we compare the time stability of barut - girardello and perelomov cs . in section 3",
    "we apply the time - dependent darboux transformation both to barut - girardello and to perelomov cs and study some properties of states thus obtained .",
    "conclusions are drown in the last section .",
    "in this section we summarize briefly what is known about this hamiltonian and its states ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite-@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) we need further .",
    "we would like to stress that although almost everything presented here is already published , but from one side we are adopting here a different approach with respect to the one usually used and from the other side we are bringing together a number of facts spread in numerous literature .",
    "in contrast to most of papers using different modifications of the method of quantum invariants @xcite for solving the schrdinger equation we are using the method of separation of variables @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that we do not need to be restricted by any quantum mechanical picture .",
    "instead , we consider the schrdinger equation as a second order parabolic differential equation , which gives us the possibility to get  nonphysical \" solutions we need for applying the darboux algorithm .      generators of the @xmath1 symmetry group , being symmetry operators of the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian @xmath2 , in coordinate representation [ kpmk ] k_-=2k_+=2 , + [ k0k ] k_0= ( k_-k_+-k_+k_- ) are expressed in terms of the harmonic oscillator creation and annihilation operators @xmath3 the dot over a symbol means the derivative with respect to time .",

    "it is clearly seen from these figures that for both cases the darboux transformation results mainly in a displacement of the curve while its shape is very little affected .",
    "we have shown that acting with the darboux transformation operator on the known cs of the time dependent singular oscillator gives us the states with the similar properties .",
