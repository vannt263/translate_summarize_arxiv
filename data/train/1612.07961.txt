    "<S> a stochastic model for intermittent fluctuations due to a super - position of uncorrelated lorentzian pulses is presented . for constant pulse duration </S>",

    "<S> a random distribution of pulse durations modifies the frequency spectrum and several examples are shown to result in power law spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of pulse durations does not influence the characteristic function and thus neither the moments nor the probability density function for the random variable . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the fluctuations are intrinsically intermittent through a large excess kurtosis moment in the limit of weak pulse overlap . </S>",
    "<S> these results allow to estimate the basic properties of fluctuations from measurement data and describe the diversity of frequency spectra reported from measurements in magnetized plasmas .    </S>",
    "<S> numerous experimental investigations on fluctuations in magnetized plasmas have demonstrated the general appearance of exponential frequency power spectra and in several cases convincingly attributed this to the presence of lorentzian pulses in the underlying time series . </S>",
    "<S> this includes basic laboratory plasmas,@xcite magnetically confined plasmas @xcite and chaotic and turbulent thermal convection.@xcite it has been anticipated that lorentzian pulses and exponential spectra are universal features of pressure - gradient driven turbulence in magnetized plasmas , leading to fluctuation - induced transport.@xcite on the other hand , the frequency spectra of plasma fluctuations are commonly fitted by power laws over limited frequency ranges , obviously motivated by prevailing theories of turbulent motions and self - similar stochastic processes.@xcite    in this contribution , an exponential power spectral density is shown to follow from a super - position of uncorrelated lorentzian pulses with constant duration . </S>",

    "<S> several examples of pulse duration distributions resulting in power law spectra are presented , including uniform , gamma and rayleigh distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations are demonstrated to be inherently intermittent , manifested by a large excess kurtosis moment in the limit of weak pulse overlap . </S>",
    "<S> another major conclusion of this work is that the characteristic function and thus the moments and the probability density function for the random variable do not depend on the distribution of pulse duration times . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , the shape of the power spectral density does not depend on the degree of pulse overlap or intermittency .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a stochastic process given by the super - position of a random sequence of @xmath0 pulses in a time interval of duration @xmath1,@xcite @xmath2 where each pulse labeled @xmath3 is characterized by an amplitude @xmath4 , arrival time @xmath5 , and duration @xmath6 , all assumed to be uncorrelated . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse arrival times @xmath5 are assumed to be independent and uniformly distributed on the time interval under consideration , that is , their probability density function is given by @xmath7 . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , the normalized auto - correlation function for the pulse shape is defined by @xmath16 and the fourier transform of this function is defined by @xmath17 in this contribution , the statistical properties of the time series given by eq .   will be investigated . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the influence of various duration time distributions in the case of lorentzian pulses will be explored .    </S>",
    "<S> the mean value of @xmath18 is given by averaging over all random variables . </S>",
    "<S> starting with the case of exactly @xmath0 events in a time interval with duration @xmath1 , this gives @xmath19 using that the pulse arrival times are uniformly distributed . </S>",
    "<S> neglecting end effects by taking the integration limits for the arrival times @xmath5 in eq .   to infinity , </S>",
    "<S> the mean value of the signal follows directly , @xmath20 taking into account that the number of pulses @xmath0 is also a random variable and averaging over this as well gives the mean value for the stationary process , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the average pulse waiting time . for a non - negative pulse function , @xmath23 , the mean value of the process is given by the average pulse amplitude and the ratio of the average pulse duration and waiting times . </S>",

    "<S> the cumulants @xmath42 are the coefficients in the expansion of the logarithm of the characteristic function for @xmath40 . from the cumulants , </S>",
    "<S> the lowest order moments are readily obtained . </S>",
    "<S> a formal power series expansion shows that the characteristic function is related to the raw moments of @xmath29 , defined by @xmath43 , @xmath44 it follows that the lowest order centred moments @xmath45 are related to the cumulants by the relations @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the variance of the random variable is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the standard deviation or root mean square ( rms ) value of the random variable . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the absolute fluctuation level is large when there is significant overlap of pulses , that is , for long pulse durations and short pulse waiting times . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the skewness and flatness moments are readily obtained,@xcite    [ moments ] @xmath51    both these moments increase with decreasing @xmath52 , clearly demonstrating the intrinsic intermittent features of a signal composed of a super - position of pulses . </S>",

    "<S> [ lsynthetic ] , where time series due to a super - position of lorentzian pulses with various degree of overlap are presented . </S>",
    "<S> note that for a symmetric amplitude distribution or an anti - symmetric pulse shape , the skewness moment clearly vanishes together with the mean value of the random variable . for large @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> the skewness and excess flatness moments both vanish , consistent with a normal distribution of the fluctuations which arise in this limit.@xcite for these reasons , @xmath52 is referred to as the intermittency parameter of the model . </S>",
    "<S> it is emphasized that the distribution of pulse durations does not influence the characteristic function and thus neither the moments nor the probability density function for the random variable .    </S>",

    "<S> the expression for the frequency spectrum is simplified by considering the centered and scaled random variable @xmath63 , @xmath64 it should be noted that this power spectral density is independent of the amplitude distribution @xmath65 and does not depend on the intermittency parameter @xmath52 , that is , the degree of pulse overlap . </S>",

    "<S> the expressions for the auto - correlation function and power spectral density become    [ rs_phi ] @xmath68    that is , they are simply determined by the auto - correlation function for the fixed pulse shape @xmath10 . in the following , the frequency spectrum will be calculated for a lorentzian pulse shape and various distributions of the pulse duration times . </S>",
    "<S> the lorentzian pulse shape is defined by @xmath69 the integral of the @xmath12-th power of the pulse function is in this case given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the gamma function . from this </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the mean value of the stationary process is given by @xmath72 , the variance is @xmath73 , and the normalized auto - correlation function and its transform are    @xmath74    in the special case of constant pulse duration it follows that the auto - correlation function is itself a lorentzian and therefore has algebraic tails , @xmath75 while the power spectral density has an exponential dependence on the frequency , @xmath76 the first term in the above equation results from the mean value of the signal , giving a zero frequency contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the second term is the anticipated exponential spectrum for a super - position of uncorrelated lorentizan pulses.@xcite    any deviation from a constant pulse duration will modify the exponential power spectral density for the random variable . </S>",
