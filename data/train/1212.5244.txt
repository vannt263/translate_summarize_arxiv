    "the recent discovery  @xcite of a new particle with properties consistent with a standard model ( sm ) higgs boson is clearly the most significant news from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "this discovery was supported by evidence for a higgs boson found by the cdf and d0 collaborations at the tevatron @xcite and completes our picture of the sm .",
    "however , the sm leaves many fundamental questions open  perhaps the most pressing issue being that the sm does not explain the value of the electroweak scale ,   the higgs mass , itself . clearly , a prime goal after the discovery is to thoroughly test the sm nature for this higgs - like signal .",
    "the sm makes precise predictions for the production cross sections of the higgs boson @xmath12 ( via gluon - gluon fusion ( ggf ) , vector boson fusion ( vbf ) , associated production with an electroweak gauge boson @xmath1 ( vh ) and associated production with a @xmath13 pair ( ) ) , and its decay branching fractions into various final states ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ) as a function of its unpredicted mass @xmath19 .",
    "the observation of the higgs boson at the lhc is based primarily on the @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite and @xmath16 @xcite decay modes .",
    "the higgs boson mass , @xmath19 , is quite precisely measured to be in the 125126  gev range using the high resolution @xmath14 and @xmath15 final states  @xcite .",
    "gev in the @xmath21 channel , the combined value from atlas is @xmath22  gev , in very good agreement with @xmath23  gev measured by cms .",
    "we find it reasonable to assume that the lower @xmath19 value from the atlas @xmath24 measurement is due to a statistical fluctuation or unknown systematics .",
    "] the evidence for the higgs boson at the tevatron is based principally on the @xmath17 decay mode @xcite , the observed enhancements being consistent with a large range of possible higgs masses .    with the measurements in various channels , a comprehensive study of the properties of the higgs - like state becomes possible and has",
    "the potential for revealing whether or not the higgs sector is as simple as envisioned in the sm . in particular",
    "it is crucial to determine the higgs couplings to gauge bosons and to fermions as defined by the lagrangian @xmath25 h\\ , ,   \\label{ldef}\\ ] ] where the @xmath26 are scaling factors for the couplings relative to their sm values , introduced to test possible deviations in the data from sm expectations . in principle",
    "all the @xmath26 are independent , in particular the @xmath27 can be different for up- and down - type quarks and/or leptons . a significant deviation of any @xmath26 from unity would imply new physics beyond the sm .    while fits to various combinations of @xmath26 s are performed by the experimental collaborations themselves  @xcite , we find it important to develop our own scheme in order to bring all results from atlas , cms and the tevatron experiments together and test not only the sm but also specific models beyond .",
    "such fits by theorists , using various parametrizations , were performed previously in @xcite . here , we go beyond these works by including all publicly available data as of the end of 2012 .",
    "in particular we take into account the updates presented at the hadron collider physics symposium in nov .",
    "2012 ( hcp2012 ) @xcite and at the open session of the cern council in dec .",
    "2012 @xcite .",
    "our parametrization is as follows .",
    "we treat the couplings to up - type and down - type fermions , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , as independent parameters ( but we only consider the case @xmath30 , and we assume that the @xmath27 are family universal ) .",
    "moreover , we assume a custodial symmetry in employing a single @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ ldef ] ) .",
    "the structure we are testing thus becomes @xmath32h\\ , .",
    "\\label{ourldef}\\ ] ] in general , the @xmath26 can take on negative as well as positive values ; there is one overall sign ambiguity which we fix by taking @xmath33 . even in this restricted context , various types of deviations of these three @xmath26 from unity are possible in extended theories such as two - higgs - doublet models ( 2hdms ) , models with singlet - doublet mixing , and supersymmetric models such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) .",
    "in addition to the tree - level couplings given above , the @xmath12 has couplings to @xmath2 and @xmath3 that are first induced at one loop and are completely computable in terms of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath34 if only loops containing sm particles are present .",
    "we define @xmath35 and @xmath36 to be the ratio of these couplings so computed to the sm (  @xmath37 ) values .",
    "however , in some of our fits we will also allow for additional loop contributions @xmath38 and @xmath39 from new particles ; in this case @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the largest set of independent parameters in our fits is thus @xmath42 in this study , we focus on models in which the higgs decays only to sm particles , in particular not allowing for invisible ( e.g. @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the lightest susy particle ) or undetected decays ( such as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a light cp - odd , perhaps singlet scalar ) .",
    "this approach , when we allow in the most general case for the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath34 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 couplings to be fully independent , encompasses a very broad range of models , including in particular those in which the higgs sector consists of any number of doublets + singlets , the only proviso being the absence of decays of the observed @xmath0 state to non - sm final states .",
    "( a fit for invisible higgs decays was performed early on in @xcite . )",
    "this approach however does not cover models such as composite models and higgs - radion mixing models for which the @xmath49 coupling has a more complicated tensor structure than that given in .",
    "our procedure will also be inadequate should the observed signal at @xmath0 actually arise from two or more degenerate higgs bosons ( see _ e.g. _",
    "although the success of our fits implies that there is no need for such extra states , the explicit tests for degenerate states developed in @xcite should be kept in mind as a means to test directly for two or more higgs bosons contributing to the signal at 125126 gev .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the experimental inputs and our fitting procedure are described in section  2 .",
    "the results of three generic fits are presented in section  3 together with the results of a fit in two - higgs - doublet models .",
    "section  4 contains our conclusions .",
    "we perform fits employing all production / decay channels for which results are available from the atlas and cms collaborations at the lhc , as well as the tevatron cdf+d0 higgs results .",
    "the experimental results are given in terms of signal strengths @xmath50 , the ratio of the observed rate for some process @xmath51 relative to the prediction for the sm higgs .",
    "often it is the case that several production processes contribute to a given experimental channel .",
    "for example , both vector boson fusion and gluon fusion can contribute to the  vbf \" channels ( or `` categories '' ) that are defined by a given set of experimental cuts .",
    "in comparing theory to experiment it is thus important to incorporate the estimates from the experiments of the relative contributions of the theoretically distinct production / decay processes .",
    "the values for the signal strengths in the various ( sub)channels as reported by the experiments and used in this analysis , together with the estimated decompositions into production channels are given in tables  [ atlasresults][tevatronresults ] .",
    "we adopt the simple technique of computing the @xmath52 associated with a given choice of the input parameters following the standard definition : ^2=_k ( _ k-_k)^2_k^2 , [ chisqdef ] where @xmath53 runs over all the experimentally defined production / decay channels employed , @xmath54 is the observed signal strength for channel @xmath53 , @xmath55 is the value predicted for that channel for a given choice of parameters and @xmath56 is the experimental error for that channel . the @xmath55 associated with each experimentally defined channel is further decomposed as _ k = t^i_k _ i [ murel ] where the @xmath57 give the amount of contribution to the experimental channel @xmath53 coming from the theoretically defined channel @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the prediction for that channel for a given choice of @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and ( for fits where treated as independent ) @xmath47 and @xmath48 . for the computation of the @xmath59 including nlo corrections we follow the procedure recommended by the lhc higgs cross section working group in  @xcite .",
    "in particular we include all the available qcd corrections for @xmath63 using ` higlu `  @xcite and for @xmath64 using ` hdecay `  @xcite , and we switch off the electroweak corrections .",
    "the @xmath57 depend on the specific analysis and hence differ from experiment to experiment .",
    "often , the @xmath57 are determined from simulations of a sm higgs signal . in some cases",
