    "this construction for the scaling functions of the transverse density and temperature profiles coincides with the method , that we developed for the solution of the relativisitic hydrodynamical equations in the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional problem , but here the transverse flow has a two - dimensional distribution , so the exponents and the scaling variables had to be re - defined accordingly .",
