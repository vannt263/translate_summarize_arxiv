    "string theory is currently one of the most promising frameworks which permits a unification between quantum field theory and general relativity . as such",
    ", it should be able to describe the physics of our universe in detail .",
    "there are in fact many string theory compactifictions which come very close to reproducing the standard model ( sm ) and its supersymmetric extension , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "examples include heterotic string compactications on orbifolds  @xcite and on calabi - yau manifolds  @xcite , and free fermionic models  @xcite .",
    "more , recently compactifications involving d - branes have attracted much attention .",
    "these types of models fall into two general classes , intersecting / magnetized d - brane models on orientifold backgrounds  @xcite , and gepner models  @xcite .",
    "one string - derived mssm satisfying all global consistency conditions has been constructed from intersecting / magnetized d - branes within the context of type ii orientifold compactifications  @xcite on a @xmath12 background .",
    "this model contains three generations of quarks and leptons as well as a single pair of higgs fields .",
    "the model contains a minimal amount of exotic matter , which may be decoupled from the low - energy sector .",
    "in addition , the tree - level gauge couplings are automatically unified at the string scale  @xcite . thus , this is a phenomenologically interesting model worthy of detailed study .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) and supergravity ( sugra ) are intimately related to string theory .",
    "in particular , string theory requires supersymmetry for consistency .",
    "furthermore , supergravity theories arise as the low - energy limits of string theories .",
    "although supersymmetry seems to be a required ingredient of string theory , this does not necessarily imply that it is broken at an energy scale such that we should expect supersymmetric partners of the sm particles to be observed at energies accessible at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "however , there are many phenomenological reasons to expect this . in particular",
    ", susy is one of the best - motivated solutions to the hierarchy problem .",
    "although the exact mechanism and scale at which susy is broken in nature should it exist is not known , simple calculations suggest that the masses of ( at least some ) of the superpartners should have @xmath13  tev@xmath14 masses if susy solves the hierarchy problem without introducing any ( or not too much ) fine - tuning . moreover , it can be shown that there is an upper bound on the higgs mass in the mssm , @xmath15  gev  @xcite .",
    "in addition to providing a solution to the hierarchy problem , susy with r - parity imposed can provide a natural candidate for dark matter  @xcite . finally , the unification of the three gauge couplings when extrapolated to high energies via the renormalization group equations ( rge ) is much more precise when susy is incorporated into the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in comparison to the non - susy sm , consistent with the idea of grand unification theories ( guts )  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a @xmath10  gev higgs boson  @xcite at the ( lhc ) has so far not been followed by the discovery of any new physics which might explain the hierarchy problem .",
    "supersymmetry remains one of the best candidates for such new physics .",
    "however , direct searches during the first run of the lhc for squarks and gluinos are pushing the mass limits for these particles into the tev range  @xcite . furthermore , to obtain a @xmath16  gev higgs mass in the mssm",
    "requires large radiative corrections involving the top / stop sector , requiring large stop squark masses @xmath17tev@xmath14 and/or large values of tan@xmath18 .",
    "the most - studied framework for supersymmetry breaking is minimal supergravity ( msugra ) , or equivalently the constrained mssm ( cmssm )  @xcite .",
    "however , to obtain a sufficiently large higgs mass in msugra / cmssm requires heavy squarks and sleptons which generically spoils the naturalness in which the hierarchy problem is solved by introducing some amount of electroweak fine - tuning ( ewft ) .",
    "one possible exception to this is the hyperbolic branch ( hb)/focus point ( fp ) region of the msugra / cmssm parameter space characterized by large @xmath0 in comparison to @xmath1 where the amount of required ewft is minimized locally relative to the full parameter space with similar values of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "several different groups have recently reassessed the status of msugra / cmssm in light of the @xmath19  gev higgs discovery  @xcite a consensus has built that the msugra / cmssm parameter space is being strongly constrained by this discovery and pushed into regions which require some degree of fine - tuning  @xcite .",
    "this has motivated the study of extensions of msugra / cmssm such as the non - universal higgs mass models ( nuhm ) where the universality condition on the scalar soft masses of msugra / cmssm is relaxed such that the higgs soft masses may be treated as independent parameters  @xcite .",
    "this allows superpartner spectra with a @xmath20-parameter close to the electroweak scale , thus featuring low fine - tuning , to be easily obtained .",
    "these models generically feature light higgsinos with masses in the few - hundred gev range .",
    "more generally , models which feature radiatively - driven natural supersymmetry ( rns ) may be considered  @xcite .    in the phenomenologically interesting intersecting / magnetized d - brane model discussed above ,",
    "it is possible to study the possible sets of supersupersymmetric soft terms which may be obtained , specifically for the f - type supersymmetry breaking where susy - breaking is dominated by the complex structure and/or k``ahler moduli as well as the universal dilaton .",
    "in general , the sets of possible soft terms in the model are non - universal .",
    "investigations into the sets of non - universal soft terms have been performed in  @xcite .",
    "however , there also exists subsets of the soft terms which feature universality . as shown in  @xcite , these subsets are similar to the the effective msugra / cmssm parameter space in that they feature a universal scalar mass @xmath0 , a universal gaugino mass @xmath1 and a universal trilinear term @xmath21 , which for the present case is fixed such that @xmath22 .",
    "these boundary conditions coincide with the slice of the effective msugra / cmssm parameter space studied in  @xcite , which includes a band along the hb / fp branch where spectra with a higgs mass in the range @xmath10  gev may be obtained in addition to sastifying experimental bounds on the dark matter relic density while also satisying most standard experimental constraints .",
    "in addition , for generic values of the k''ahler moduli in the model , the soft terms for sfermions are split about the higgs mass - squared terms as @xmath3 and @xmath4 where @xmath23 is a function of the k``ahler moduli .",
    "only for a specific choice of the k''ahler moduli do the soft terms reduce to those with a universal scalar mass for both higgs and sfermions .",
    "interestingly , it was observed in  @xcite that focus points may be realized with any boundary condition of the form @xmath7 with @xmath8 an arbitrary constant .",
    "these are essentially the same as boundary conditions in the model that we are considering , the only difference being that the soft terms in the model have this form for all three families of sfermions .",
    "thus , we should expect to obtain the same set of focus points in the model regardless of the choice of k``ahler moduli .",
    "it should be emphasized that the more general choice of k''ahler moduli goes beyond msugra / cmssm .    in the following , detailed scans of the d - brane model supersymetry parameter space with @xmath2 have been performed .",
    "regions of this parameter space featuring light higgsinos , a @xmath19  gev higgs mass , and low ewft are identified and discussed .",
    "in particular , it is found that there exists superpartner spectra with a light higgsino - like lsp with @xmath24  gev masses and a higgs mass in the range @xmath10  gev , and which satisfy most standard experimental constraints .",
    "consequently , viable spectra with low ewft between @xmath11 may be obtained .",
    "the dark matter direct - detection cross - sections for these spectra are in range of future experiments such as xenon-1 t  @xcite and super cdms  @xcite .",
    "in addition , most of the spectra are consistent with constraints from indirect - detection experiments .",
    "finally , the parameter space where the scalar mass - squared terms for squarks and sleptons are split about the higgs mass - squared term , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , is also studied in detail .",
    "as mentioned , this parameter space is obtained from the string model for generic values of the k``ahler moduli and goes beyond msugra / cmssm . as expected , the hb / fp regions are also present for this region of the parameter space , independent of the choice of k''ahler moduli .",
    "let us consider the realistic mssm constructed from interesecting / magnetized d - branes studied in  @xcite .",
    "this simple and elegant model has many desirable phenomenological features such as three families of quarks and leptons , minimal exotic matter , gauge coupling unification , and rank-3 yukawa mass matrices  @xcite such that it is possible to obtain the correct fermion masses and mixings .",
    "in addition , one variation of the model allows either baryon or lepton number to exists as a local gauge symmetry , thus forbidding proton decay  @xcite .",
    "the model also satisfies all conditions for global consistency such as tadpole and anomaly cancellation .",
    "type ii orientifold string compactifications with intersecting / magnetized d - branes have provided useful geometric tools with which the mssm may be engineered  @xcite . to briefly give an over view of the construction of such models , d6-branes in type iia fill ( 3 + 1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime and wrap 3-cycles in the compactified manifold , such that a stack of @xmath25 branes generates a gauge group u(@xmath25 ) [ or u(@xmath26 ) in the case of @xmath27 in its world volume . in general , the 3-cycles wrapped by the stacks of d6-branes intersect multiple times in the internal space , resulting in a chiral fermion in the bifundamental representation localized at the intersection between different stacks @xmath28 and @xmath29 . the multiplicity of such fermions is then given by the number of times the 3-cycles intersect .",
    "each stack of d6-branes @xmath28 may intersect the orientifold images of other stacks @xmath30 , also resulting in fermions in bifundamental representations .",
    "each stack may also intersect its own image @xmath31 , resulting in chiral fermions in the symmetric and antisymmetric representations .",
    "in addition , the consistency of the model requires certain constraints to be satisfied , namely , ramond - ramond ( r - r ) tadpole cancellation and the preservation of @xmath32 supersymmetry .",
    "the model discussed in  @xcite describes a three - generation pati - salam model with additional hidden sectors .",
    "the full gauge symmetry of the model is given by @xmath33_{\\rm observable } \\times [ { \\rm usp}(2)^4]_{\\rm hidden}$ ] .",
    "as discussed in detail in  @xcite , with this configuration of d6 branes all r - r tadpoles are canceled , k - theory constraints are satisfied , and @xmath32 supersymmetry is preserved .",
    "using the effective scalar potential it is possible to study the stability  @xcite , the tree - level gauge couplings @xcite , gauge threshold corrections @xcite , and gauge coupling unification @xcite .",
    "the effective yukawa couplings @xcite , matter field khler metric and soft - susy breaking terms have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the khler metric and string scattering of gauge , matter , and moduli fields has been performed in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath32 supergravity action depends upon three functions , the holomorphic gauge kinetic function , @xmath34 , k\"ahler potential @xmath35 , and the superpotential @xmath36 .",
    "each of these will in turn depend upon the moduli fields which describe the background upon which the model is constructed .",
    "supersymmetry is broken when some of the f - terms of the hidden sector fields @xmath37 acquire vevs .",
    "this then results in soft terms being generated in the observable sector .",
    "for simplicity , it is assumed in this analysis that the @xmath38-term does not contribute ( see @xcite ) to the susy breaking .",
    "then , the goldstino is eaten by the gravitino via the superhiggs effect and thus the gravitino obtains a mass , @xmath39 .",
    "the normalized gaugino mass parameters , scalar mass - squared parameters , and trilinear parameters respectively may be given in terms of the k``ahler potential , the gauge kinetic function , and the superpotential as @xmath40 , \\label{softterms}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the k''ahler metric appropriate for d - branes which are parallel on at least one torus , i.e. involving non - chiral matter .",
    "we assume that the supersymmetric breaking in the model is dominated by the complex structure moduli @xmath42 , @xmath43 which describe the shape of the compactified dimensions as well as the universal dilaton @xmath44 .",

    "the scalar masses - squared for sfermions are split about the higgs scalar mass - squared . in principle",
    ", it should be possible to dynamically fix the k``ahler moduli , complex structure moduli and the dilaton in the model by including non - perturbative effects such as supergravity fluxes or gaugino condensation in a hidden sector .",

    "our objective in the following sections is thus to study the more general parameter space with @xmath6 , which occurs for generic values of the k\"ahler moduli , in addition to the case with @xmath5 .",

    "thus , we should find that a focus point in the parameter space with @xmath5 is also a focus point when @xmath6 .",
    "since @xmath23 is a function which depends on the k``ahler moduli , it should be the case that the hb / fp region of the parameter space is essentially independent of the k''ahler moduli .",
    "indeed this is the case , as we shall see .",
    "as noted in the previous section , the high - scale boundary conditions for this model are universal for a specific value of the k``ahler moduli . for this case",
    "the soft terms are similar to those of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) , one of the most studied model of supersymmetry breaking .",

    "however , it should be kept in mind that the truly fundamental parameters are @xmath1 , @xmath84 , @xmath82 and @xmath20 from which the effective parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath21 are related by eqns .",
    "[ softterms2 ] .",
    "in addition , the sfermion mass splitting @xmath85 depends upon the k''ahler moduli of the string - derived model .",
    "this splitting is zero for a specific value of the k\"ahler moduli , and so the gut - scale parameters are universal for this case . in the following , we will study the resulting supersymmetry parameter space for both @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "an important question is whether or not this is accomplished naturally without reintroducing any fine - tuning .",
    "in fact , the mass of the observed higgs boson is slightly too large to accomodate in models such as msugra / cmssm without some level of fine - tuning .",
    "this is refererred to as the _ little hierarchy problem_. ordinarily , spectra with large scalar masses would generically be considered highly fine - tuned .",
    "this is not necessarily true for those spectra which fall in the hb / fp region of the parameter space , which may feature reduced electroweak fine - tuning relative to the local parameter space with similar values of @xmath0 . the amount of fine - tuning with respect to the electroweak scale ( ewft ) is typically quantified by the minimal electroweak fine - tuning parameter @xmath114 where @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 .",

    ", we shall use this parameter to analyze the minimal amount of fine - tuning required regions of the studied parameter space .    in  @xcite",
    ", it is argued that @xmath73 only provides a measure of the minimum amount of fine - tuning in regards to the electroweak scale and provides no information about the high scale physics involved in a particular model of susy breaking . in order to provide a measure of how fine - tuned a particular model is given knowledge of how susy is broken at a high energy scale ,",
    "a parameter called @xmath121 was introduced which is analogous to @xmath73  @xcite . for most of the parameter space",
