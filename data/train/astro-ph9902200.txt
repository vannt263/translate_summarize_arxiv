    "astrophysical jets are fast and well - collimated flows , observed in a wide variety of astronomical systems , ranging from young stellar objects ( e.g.  @xcite ) , galactic superluminal sources ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) , to quasars ( e.g.  @xcite )",
    ". a single mechanism may be responsible for their formation and collimation ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a candidate model is the magneto - centrifugal mechanism proposed by blandford and payne ( 1982 ) , investigated for instance in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and reviewed recently by knigl & pudritz ( 1999 ; see , however , @xcite for an alternative model ) . in this picture ,",
    "parcels of cold gas are stripped from the surface of a keplerian disk and flung out along open magnetic field lines by centrifugal force . at large distances from the source region",
    ", rotation winds the field lines up into concentric loops around the axis .",
    "these magnetic loops pinch on the outflow ( or wind ) and collimate it into a narrow jet .",
    "the original wind solution of blandford & payne ( 1982 ) is axisymmetric , steady - state and self - similar .",
    "the self - similarity ansatz is expected to break down near the rotation axis and at large distances , where appropriate boundary conditions must be imposed .",
    "there have been several studies seeking non - self - similar steady - state wind solutions .",
    "sakurai ( 1985 , 1987 ) and @xcite took the approach of starting directly from the time - independent mhd equations and found steady - state solutions iteratively .",
    "however , no general solutions are available at the present from this approach , due to the great complexity of the critical surfaces whose loci are unknown a priori ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , there is no guarantee that a steady - state solution can be found at all for a given set of boundary conditions .",
    "a time - dependent approach provides a surer method for studying mhd outflows , both steady state or not .",
    "this more flexible approach has been adopted by several authors ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is also the approach we shall take .",
    "following stone & norman ( 1993 ) and ouyed & pudritz ( 1997 ) , we treat the keplerian disk as a boundary and use the zeus mhd code to simulate the time - dependent , disk - wind .",
    "the main subtleties come from treating the disk - wind boundary the disk surface and the region close to the rotation axis .",
    "a special treatment of the disk - wind boundary is warranted , because this is the place where matter is ejected into the wind and where magnetic field lines are anchored . on this boundary ,",
    "some of the flow variables can be fixed , but not all of them .",
    "this point is illustrated most clearly by steady - state mhd winds , which have three , well - known critical surfaces slow , alfvnic and fast ( @xcite ) .",
    "crossing each of these critical surfaces imposes a set of constraints on the flow variables .",
    "similarly , it is impossible to assign arbitrary fixed values to all the quantities at the disk boundary : some quantities must be left free to adjust according to flow conditions in the sub - fast region .",
    "failure to do so will overdetermine the problem , forming numerical boundary layers with local discontinuities and impulsive acceleration of numerical origin close to the disk , which may cast doubts about the origin of the jet launched in the simulation .",
    "a numerical boundary layer may cause the effective boundary conditions governing the wind flow to differ from those imposed at the disk , as mentioned in @xcite .",
    "this loss of control is particularly inconvenient when doing parametrical studies . in this paper",
    "we prevent such overdeterminations by properly taking into account the existence of information going upstream from the critical surfaces .",
    "our main improvement over previous zeus - based works is to fix only the necessary number of boundary conditions at the disk surface .",
    "romanova et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and ustyugova et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have implemented a similar method for their godunov - type code independently .",
    "in addition , we derive a physically motivated method for treating the outflow near the rotation axis . centrifugal acceleration in the axial region",
    "does not happen in the magneto - centrifugal picture because the centrifugal force vanishes on the axis .",
    "a gravitational infall is expected along the axis , which could disrupt the outflow from the disk through streaming instabilities . to prevent such infall",
    ", some previous authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) assumed a high ( thermal and/or turbulent ) pressure to counterbalance the gravity of the central object .",
    "we , on the other hand , assume the presence of a narrow jet near the axis as explained in ",
    "[ magnetomodel ] .",
    "such a jet could be driven either electromagnetically by a rotating black hole ( @xcite ) in the context of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) or by interaction of a central star with a disk stellar wind ( e.g.  @xcite ) in the context of young stellar objects .    in this paper",
    "we describe in detail our numerical approach and present our first results using the code . in  [ physmodel ] we explain the physical model , the numerical code is introduced in  [ computer ] and the the boundary conditions in  [ boundary ] .",
    "our results are described in  [ results ] , and conclusions in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "further features of the numerical approach are presented in an appendix .    in forthcoming papers we shall explore the effects of the size of the jet - launching disk , the dependence of the mass flux @xmath15 with the inclination angle @xmath0 , and perform a 3d study .",
    "we will use axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates @xmath16 , such that the launching surface is at @xmath17 and the axis at @xmath18 . a subindex @xmath19 will denote quantities in the poloidal plane @xmath20 .",
    "the notation is similar to that in blandford and payne ( 1982 ) or @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic mhd equations used here are @xmath21 where @xmath22 we use a smoothed gravity , @xmath23 , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 fixed parameters .",
    "the product @xmath26 gives the scale of keplerian speeds .",
    "some quantities are conserved along the fieldlines in the steady state ( @xcite ) , becoming functions of the magnetic flux @xmath27 alone .",
    "two such quantities are the relation between mass and magnetic flux @xmath28 and the conserved angular velocity @xmath29 , which at @xmath17 has the equilibrium value @xmath30 . in steady state , the velocity is related to the magnetic field by @xmath31 .",
    "conservation also applies to the specific angular momentum @xmath32 and the specific energy @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the enthalpy , of small importance in our cold winds .",
    "finally , the entropy @xmath35 is conserved by our equations , but it is not relevant here .",
    "we will check these conserved quantities as a measure of the final approach to steady state .",
    "consider poloidal magnetic fieldlines emerging from the surface of an accretion disk .",
    "in steady state , the flow will be along these lines , due to the frozen - in property of ideal mhd flows .",
    "we can picture one element of gas flowing along a fieldline as a ` bead ' sliding on a rigid ` wire ' ( @xcite ) .",
    "let that bead start from @xmath17 , at a slow speed or at rest .",
    "the wire is rotating at a constant angular speed @xmath36 .",
    "this will exert on the bead a centrifugal force outwards , competing against the gravitational force pushing the bead inwards .",
    "for a lever arm large enough , the centrifugal force wins this competition , and the field line propels the flow .",
    "this happens when the inclination @xmath0 of the poloidal fieldlines from the axis is larger that a critical angle @xmath37 , allowing the flow to accelerate centrifugally along the fieldline as if shot by a sling .",
    "this critical angle is @xmath38 for newtonian gravity and keplerian rotation , only slightly changed by our smoothed gravity .    the fieldlines twist in the toroidal direction due to the differential rotation between the corona and the disk .",
    "this generates a toroidal component @xmath39 , whose magnetic pressure tends to collimate the flow , decreasing @xmath0 along a fieldline for increasing height @xmath40 . in addition , the gradient in the poloidal field pressure causes focusing , depending on the shape of the flux function .",
    "critical surfaces are the alfvnic ( @xmath41 ) and fast surface ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the slow magnetosonic surface is not relevant here due to our low sound speed .",
    "acceleration is due to the centrifugal and magnetic forces , which taken per unit mass and projected along the poloidal fieldlines , are @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these two forces must counter the projected gravitational pull @xmath45 .",
    "effective acceleration requires that the collimation of the fieldlines is not complete before the alfvn surface is reached : otherwise the projected centrifugal force would be too small .",
    "close to the axis , the fieldlines have an inclination lower than the critical angle @xmath38 , so they can not propel the flow centrifugally . for the purpose of designing this fully cold simulation , we can not prevent gravitational infall by the use of thermal pressure , which is an isotropic mechanism that would push across fieldlines as well as along them , making a large fraction of our simulation hot .",
    "we assume instead a ballistic axial injection of matter close to escape speed .",
    "its ram pressure provides a simple non - isotropic mechanism , which achieves the numerical objective of stopping gravitational backflow and isolating the region where the inclination of fieldlines is too small , without compromising the footpoints of the fieldlines with transverse flows , as a pressure - driven mechanism might tend to do .",
    "this jet core made of axial flow is not only a convenient numerical device ; it is physically justified in agn , and galactic superluminal sources , which may create a central electromagnetic jet carrying poynting flux and exerting an anisotropic maxwell stress at its surface .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the ballistic injection thus represents the effects of a feature of the flow not covered by the magneto - centrifugal model alone .",
    "to perform our simulations we wrote a variant , called zeus36 , based on the zeus3d code , released by lca ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "zeus3d is an explicit , finite - differencing algorithm , running on an eulerian grid .",
    "conservation of mass and momentum components is guaranteed by the code .",
    "magnetic fields are evolved using the constrained transport method ( @xcite ) , which guarantees that no monopoles will be generated , limited only by the numerical precision of the machine",
    ". an advanced method of characteristics ( @xcite ) is used to calculate @xmath46 and the transverse lorentz force .",
    "a large base of tests has already been done on this community code , and we have not changed the central difference scheme .",
    "zeus36 is a modification of zeus3d written for parallel computers , such as for instance the intel paragon and the touchstone delta .",
    "it uses mpi a standard message passing interface for parallel machines , including networks of workstations .",
    "this makes zeus36 easily portable in the parallel computing world .",
    "the 3d parallelization scheme is straightforward .",
    "we subdivide the computational cubic grid into n smaller grids , each given to one of the n compute nodes .",
    "communication between the nodes is realized by taking advantage of the boundary condition subroutines , appropriately modified to allow communication between adjacent compute nodes . zeus36",
    "also improves upon the latest released versions of zeus3d ( version 3.4 ) by treating the boundary conditions at the corners and edges of the grid more consistently .",
    "corners and edges are of less importance when the code is not run in parallel .",
    "they become more important in a parallel treatment , where they appear in the middle of the overall mesh rather than less obtrusively at the boundaries of the calculation .",
    "the user interface was modified to make it more convenient to our usage on many different computer systems , serial and parallel .",
    "for instance , it was decided not to use the powerful precompiler editor ( @xcite ) , bundled into the zeus3d release .",
    "these changes , together with the use of dynamic memory allocation , eliminate the need to recompile the main code when the grid size is changed .",
    "zeus36 has been tested for both internal consistency and consistency with zeus3d .",
    "we have made sure that the output does not depend on the distribution or number of the nodes used to compute a given grid . to test consistency with zeus3d",
    ", we have run some test problems using both programs , and compared their output byte - by - byte .",
    "the small departures observed were those due to the improvement in the treatment of corners and edges : no difference appeared after those were accounted for .      in these axisymmetric simulations the computational grid has four boundaries : axis ( @xmath18 ) , outer radius ( @xmath47 ) , disk ( @xmath17 ) and outer height ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the code enforces boundary conditions by assigning values to the fields @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 at the grid edge and at a few ghost zones outside the computational grid .",
    "the boundary conditions for @xmath53 are enforced indirectly from the values of @xmath52 , using the equation @xmath54 to evolve @xmath53 in both active and ghost zones , ensuring @xmath55 everywhere .",
    "the exact location and grid staggering of these ghost zones follows stone & norman ( 1992 ) .",
    "the axis boundary is geometrically well - determined by axisymmetry , and it has offered no complications either in implementing or running .",
    "the conditions are implemented as usual for the axis in cylindrical coordinates . in the calculation of ghost zone values for @xmath56 , scalar fields",
    "are reflected , and vector components are reflected with a change of sign in the directions @xmath57 and @xmath58 .      the upper boundary is treated in our simulation using an outflow boundary condition , as defined in the zeus3d code . specifically , for @xmath59 @xmath60 for all fields , except for @xmath61 .",
    "this is not perfect , but , as the physics of our simulation implies the existence of a supersonic , super - alfvnic accelerated outflow , these imperfections are not expected to have a large influence in the simulated flow .",
    "this is more delicate , especially at low altitude where the flow is sub - alfvnic , and can influence the upstream flow . in practice",
    "we use similar outflow conditions as for @xmath48 . label the fieldline that becomes trans - alfvnic at @xmath47 , by @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "[ s1_mai ] ) , and it is clear that artificial conditions imposed at @xmath47 for @xmath63 may induce spurious collimation .",
    "we must therefore explore the sensitivity of our results to our treatment of this part of the flow ( cf .",
    " [ engineering ] ) .    in one example of an alternative prescription , romanova et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have used a `` force - free '' prescription , @xmath64 , that can be written as @xmath65 ; a later proposal from the same authors is taking @xmath66 , with @xmath67 a constant to be determined ( @xcite ) , observing that artificial collimation may occur for inappropriate box sizes .",
    "even more important is the treatment of @xmath17 .",
    "it represents the launching surface of the model , located at the top of the disk , or the base of the corona , above the slow magnetosonic surface .",
    "its properties will determine all the flow downstream .",
    "the first question to address is the number of boundary conditions we are allowed to fix at this surface .",
    "this number is equal to the number of waves outgoing normally from the boundary , equal to the number of characteristics .",
    "we calculate it by counting the degrees of freedom of the system , subtracting all constraints .",
    "we have , in principle , seven degrees of freedom : the density , three components of @xmath51 and @xmath53 , minus the constraint @xmath55 , and also the internal energy , because our simulation , while dynamically cold , keeps track of a small internal energy .",
    "each crossing of a critical surface is also a constraint that will remove one degree of freedom . in principle",
    "there are three such surfaces , slow , alfvnic and fast ; however , the initial @xmath68 at @xmath17 is already larger than the slow speed , so only two critical surfaces will be crossed .",
    "we are left with five independent waves out of the original seven .",
    "five boundary conditions should be imposed .",
    "a more detailed deduction of this result can be seen for instance in @xcite .",
    "we choose to fix the five fields @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 at the disk if launching were sub - slow , the presence of the slow critical surface would reduce the number of independent boundary conditions to the first four . at @xmath17 ,",
    "the boundary conditions for @xmath69 and @xmath70 are derived from the infinite conductivity of the disk material , giving @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the condition for @xmath74 implies that @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "the condition for @xmath77 implies that @xmath78 .",
    "implementation is done by assigning values to fields at the ghost zones @xmath79 .",
    "density , velocity and internal energy are defined at the ghost zones as straightforward functions of @xmath57 , with @xmath80 for a small constant @xmath81 .",
    "this fixes the mass flux @xmath82 ; if our launching were subsonic , this quantity should be determined from the crossing of the slow critical surface .",
    "the magnetic field evolves in time following @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "fixing @xmath72 at @xmath17 keeps @xmath86 constant in that plane , anchoring the fieldlines to the disk surface .",
    "the angle @xmath87 between the fieldlines and the vertical evolves in the active zones ; a similar evolution must be present in the ghost zones .",
    "otherwise , the fieldlines would present sharp kinks at the base of the wind @xmath17 , associated with large currents and localized forces which might mask the launching mechanism .",
    "an evolving @xmath88 requires an @xmath89 dependence in the ghost zones ; knowing that @xmath69 vanishes at @xmath17 , we choose @xmath69 to be an odd function of @xmath40 .",
    "the resulting antisymmetric time dependence of the field @xmath90 and the flux @xmath27 allows @xmath0 to vary in approximately the same way in both active and ghost zones , so that the final inclination of the fieldlines is decided by the flow itself and its crossing of the critical surfaces , producing a much better steady state than alternative approaches in which the fieldline inclination is fixed .",
    "similarly we make @xmath91 symmetric around its known value at @xmath17 , defining @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "( an alternative possibility here would be extrapolating the fieldlines inside the ghost zones ; however , this is somewhat more difficult to implement . ) with this choice , one term of the time dependence of @xmath39 is even in @xmath40 .",
    "we make the other term also even , by requiring @xmath94 , which allows this quantity to vary freely . finally we need values for @xmath95 and @xmath96",
    ". we will take them from @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which we implement using the values of @xmath90 and @xmath36 at @xmath17 .",
    "following the variation of these quantities inside the ghost zones is also a possible option .    in some simulations",
    "we find occasions early during the run , long before steady state is approached in which @xmath99 at the first active zone close to the disk . in that case",
    "we modify the boundary conditions , allowing the disk to absorb the backflow , preventing the numerical artifacts shown in the appendix .",
    "the ghost values at @xmath79 for the fields @xmath49 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are taken temporarily from their values at the first active zone with @xmath100 , @xmath71 is set to zero and the internal energy to @xmath80 .",
    "thus backflow is absorbed , and will eventually disappear .    in this paper",
    "we artificially prescribe @xmath101 as a function of @xmath57 alone , although mass loading is effective only for @xmath102 . however , in the steady state simulations presented here this inequality is satisfied for most of the disk outside the innermost region , justifying our choices after the fact .",
    "we shall return to this in a following paper , in which @xmath15 will be allowed to depend also on @xmath0 .",
    "the functions of radius are parametrized using a combination of exponents and softening radii : @xmath103 we have used @xmath104 ( linear ) and @xmath105 ( quadratic ) . for large @xmath57 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 .",
    "this implementation of disk boundary conditions uses some values of the fields in the corona ; there is upstream propagation of information .",
    "the velocity at @xmath17 is supersonic but sub - alfvnic ; upstream propagation of waves is physically expected . a simulation that omits this effect is incomplete , and our results are , manifestly , sensitive to the treatment of the surface conditions .",
    "there is in principle a risk of numerical instability involved in using this information in the code ; fortunately , our runs did not show this kind of instability .      naturally , we are interested in flows that are independent of our starting conditions .",
    "it turns out that transients generally decay in a few alfvn crossing times , and do not influence the late final flow .",
    "nevertheless , they deserve some detailed explanation .",
    "initially @xmath109 is defined from its boundary condition value @xmath86 at @xmath17 , and the initial position of the footpoint @xmath110 of a generic poloidal fieldline passing through a point @xmath20 .",
    "this footpoint @xmath111 is found from the equation @xmath112 , where @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 are constant parameters .",
    "the lengthscale @xmath116 determines the location of the initial footpoint @xmath119 of the critical fieldline @xmath120 with @xmath121 , @xmath117 gives the initial curvature and collimation of the fieldlines , and @xmath118 sets the maximum slope @xmath122 allowed for the fieldlines , through the prescription @xmath123 valid at @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath118 is set to infinity , all angles @xmath0 are allowed , and @xmath124 .",

    "for simplicity , this initial @xmath96 is chosen as independent of @xmath40 .",

    "if this is a physical effect or an artifact caused by the edges , we enlarged the box in both directions , as shown below in  [ superalfvenic ] , finding that it is indeed only an artifact .",
    "we now explore the sensitivity of our solution to changes in the functions @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath86 , parametrized by the exponents @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath115 , or @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "first we checked that @xmath14 is indeed a good parameter .",
    "we did a variable density simulation with the same value of @xmath101 as the standard run , but with @xmath197 instead of zero , and let it run for the same physical time",
    ". for @xmath198 , the results of the variable density simulation coincide with the reference run ; however , steady state is not achieved at the outer corner ( figs .",
    "[ n123lines ] and [ n123den ] ) . despite its slower convergence",
    ", it represents the same physical steady state as the reference run , with the exception of very small values of @xmath40 , where the different profile of @xmath49 still has some influence . for a larger value of the density exponent , such as @xmath199 , the run fails to reach steady state in the same box as the reference run .",
    "however , simulations with a box size four times larger ( see  [ superalfvenic ] ) show that the @xmath199 case is nearly identical to the other cases .",
    "the effects of the box size are discussed in the next section .",
    "we thank the referee for suggesting this test .",
    "having done this , we next made a few simulations for different values of the parameters .",
    "[ nvarious ] shows the critical surfaces and fieldlines for these runs .",
    "their shapes are qualitatively similar , with the remarkable exception of the outer fieldlines for the flatter @xmath15 simulation @xmath200 , @xmath201 ; some of these lines start pointing inwards instead of outwards .",
    "not all fieldlines are able to propel the flow centrifugally at @xmath17 ; they must spend some initial kinetic energy before acceleration can start .",
    "further tests can tell if this unexpected effect is physical or only a numerical artifact . because the assumption @xmath202 is not fulfilled everywhere",
    ", these tests should take into account that the mass flux should be reduced for those fieldlines , as we will do in future work by using a @xmath15 dependent on @xmath0 .",
    "values of speed , alfvn number , lever - arm ratio , luminosity and torque are calculated at the point @xmath203 , and given as functions of the exponents @xmath115 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 in table  [ tableparameters ] .",
    "the first four colums are the simulations represented in fig .",
    "[ nvarious ] .",
    "the last column is the variable density simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ n123lines ] , where we can already see that its flux at the outer corner is slightly different from that of the reference run ; this is due to its insufficient convergence to the steady state in that region of the computational volume .",
    "we want to test the convergence of the simulations to a steady state solution by changing some computational and physical parameters from our reference run .",
    "we reduced the resolution of the original standard run by one half , using a box with @xmath204 active pixels , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "simulation converged to a steady state similar to the reference run , with maximum @xmath205 and maximum @xmath206 .",
    "the resolution test is therefore passed .",
    "here we show a run done in a larger box with @xmath132 active pixels , @xmath207 and @xmath208 ; this is the same space resolution used in  [ lowres ] , with a box extending in space to twice the height and width .",
    "once a steady state was achieved , we checked that the lower quadrant of this solution was compatible with the reference run .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ s2_alfven ] we compare the surfaces of constant alfvn number for the two runs with good results : we recover the strongly accelerated flow found before .",
    "the maximum alfvn number in the lower quadrant of this run is 3.78 , and the maximum fast number is 1.34 , which is close to the reference run and even closer to the results of  [ lowres ] .",
    "we also want to check the ratio of projected forces @xmath209 , especially near the location of the outer corner of the reference run , now the center of the computational box . looking into fig .",
    "[ s2_mc ] , we see that @xmath209 in this region",
    "is smooth , with positive magnetic acceleration ; therefore we conclude that the deceleration observed in the reference run was only an edge effect related to the outer corner . as another indication that our treatment of the outer boundary conditions could be improved for @xmath185",
    ", this simulation shows a tiny triangle of magnetic deceleration near its outer corner .",
    "this run has also the same physical parameters , changing only the shape of the computational box .",
    "here we cut the larger box from  [ superalfvenic ] in half , obtaining a square box with @xmath210 active pixels , @xmath133 and @xmath208 .",
    "the results show that the alfvnic surface crosses the outer boundary @xmath48 : the flow at the boundary @xmath47 is fully sub - alfvnic .",
    "the last fieldline able to make the alfvn transition , @xmath62 crosses now the @xmath48 edge .",
    "it marks the separation between two very different kinds of simulated flow . towards the axis",
    ", we have the usual magnetocentrifugally accelerated flow in steady state . but",
    "outside , in the sub - alfvnic region , we have a complex structure out of steady state , with filaments of magneto - centrifugal acceleration approximately parallel to the fieldlines , wide islands where the projected magnetic force @xmath185 is negative , and sharp variations in the magnetic twist @xmath211 .",
    "collimation is excessive , slowing down the acceleration of the flow .",
    "the total projected force along fieldlines , @xmath212 , is negative in a sizable part of the box , instead of only around the axis .    as we have shown in ",
    "[ superalfvenic ] , this complex flow disappears in a larger and axially elongated box ; it is made possible by the finite size , which sets artificial limits on the critical surfaces .",
    "the fieldlines with @xmath213 are able to reach the alfvn surface , carry the proper critical point information , and propagate it downwards to the disk . due to the shape of the box here",
    ", most fieldlines have @xmath63 , with critical points at @xmath59 , inaccessible to the simulation .",
    "mathematically , the assumptions used to decide the number of functions to fix at the disk surface are wrong , because the critical points are not reached . in this region , each streamline is almost independent from each other , creating the possibility of filaments .    we want to check our assumption that the different behavior of our square and non - square boxes is due to the location of the alfvn surface . to do that , we moved the alfvn surface used in  [ subalfvenic ] by reducing the intensity of the magnetic fields by half without changing the box .",
    "it allows the flow to become super - alfvnic inside the square computational box .",
    "the flow is smooth , showing again a case where the difference between filamentary and smooth runs lays in the relative position of the simulated alfvn surface and the computational volume .",
    "we have also checked that the conserved quantities are functions of @xmath27 .",
    "the setup used here is similar to the reference run .",
    "it differs only in the initial values of @xmath39 and @xmath96 , set by @xmath214 and @xmath215 , with @xmath216 a small fraction , equal to 0.01 . for simplicity",
    ", we have kept using initial values of @xmath39 and @xmath96 independent of @xmath40 ; we could have chosen them to make the initial @xmath36 a function of @xmath27 , but the initial values for @xmath39 would still be away from steady state .    here",
    "we have a large initial toroidal field , which provides excessive collimation of the fieldlines , making the angle @xmath0 too small for magnetocentrifugal acceleration . also , the magnetic force along the fieldlines is such that @xmath217 acts like a pressure ; @xmath218 grows along the fieldlines , stopping the acceleration of the flow .",
    "the results present filamentation , low acceleration , and high twist .",
    "this flow is sub - alfvnic in all the volume .",
    "we observe here that initial conditions can matter in these simulations , provided that the alfvn surface is not reached .",
    "these tests tell that smooth acceleration of the simulated flow is obtained when a majority of the fieldlines reach the critical alfvn surface inside the computational volume . if this condition is met , the simulation results depend mostly on the disk boundary conditions , with little dependence on the outer boundary conditions .",
    "the transients are quickly swept up by the advance of the fast accelerating flow .",
    "the opposite happens when too many fieldlines lay in the @xmath63 region : then the runs show filamentation , excessive collimation , dependence on initial and outer boundary conditions , and obviously a slow acceleration . controlling",
    "the position of the critical surfaces inside the computational box can improve convergence , which will help in the setup of future simulations .",
    "we plan to utilize this idea in a future work , in which we will set up initial and boundary conditions such that the rotating disk will be enclosed by an alfvn surface , fully nested inside the computational box ; this setup should minimize the influence of the outer boundaries . as shown in   4.3.3",
    ", the shape and size of the simulation box can sometimes introduce artificial nonsteadiness to a sub - alfvnic flow .",
    "caution must be observed also in steady - state sub - alfvnic flows , due to their possible dependence on the outer boundary .",
    "the tendencies to filamentation , both of numerical and physical origin , show that the stability and interaction between the various streamlines in this flow are not fully explored yet .",
    "this encourages us even more to follow up this work with a 3d simulation , for which this work will be the starting condition .",
    "the parallel code necessary to do such massive computation is already written and tested .",
    "this paper is the first in a series exploring various aspects of jets launched from accretion disks .",
    "here we have presented the code and shown the results of cold , axisymmetric , time - dependent simulations , paying special attention to the treatment of the jet - launching surface and the region near the rotation axis . from these simulations",
    "we conclude that :    1 )  as expected , cold , steady jets can be launched smoothly from keplerian disks by the magneto - centrifugal mechanism .",
    "the same mechanism is also effective in collimating the outflows .",
    "collimation is observed both in the shape of the fieldlines and in the density profiles , which become cylindrical and thus jet - like at large distances along the rotation axis , in agreement with asymptotic analysis .",
    "2 )  the magneto - centrifugal mechanism for jet production is robust to changes in the conditions at the base of the jets , whose consequences are consistent with expectations .",
    "3 )  steady - state jets obtained in earlier studies using an essentially incomplete treatment of the disk boundary conditions are qualitatively unchanged when this deficiency is rectified .",
    "it remains to be shown , however , whether the same is true for non - steady jets .",
    "4 )  the structure of the outflows is insensitive to the initial density or flow speed at the injection surface individually , as long as their product ( i.e. , the mass flux ) is kept constant .    5 )",
    "the size of the simulation box can strongly influence the outcome of a simulation unless most field lines pass through the alfvn surface within the box . as a result ,",
    "simulations that produce mainly sub - alfvnic disk outflows , steady or not , must be treated with caution .",
    "this highlights the pressing need for box - invariant simulations , which are under way .",
    "6 )  zeus3d can be parallelized so that solutions from different subgrids match smoothly .",
    "[ backflow ] we mention here some numerical problems that had to be overcome in developing the code , in the spirit of helping developers of similar codes .",
    "a simulation can develop backflow through at least two physical mechanisms .",
    "one is simple gravitational infall , which operates mostly in the axial region , where the magneto - centrifugal acceleration fails .",
    "a second mechanism is cocoon backflow . due to the differential keplerian rotation ,",
    "the inner parts of the flow launch a jet earlier than the outer .",
    "the cocoon of this jet may produce a temporary backflow .",
    "when the backflow impinges into the disk boundary , our boundary conditions shown in  [ diskbc ] carefully allow the disk to absorb it .",
    "this easy prescription avoids the problems discussed below .",
    "however , in our earliest simulations , our disk boundary was independent of the sign of @xmath71 in the first active zone .",
    "this created two kinds of trouble : false acceleration , and filamentation .      in this scenario ,",
    "backflowing material tries to get back towards the disk , where it finds a boundary condition imposing a positive speed outwards .",
    "compression increases the density close to @xmath17 .",
    "this increased mass is then flung out at the speed @xmath71 given by the boundary condition imposed .",
    "no physical process is involved : only a badly chosen boundary .",
    "this false acceleration is seen more clearly when we reduce the axial injection , allowing the gravitational infall to go all the way into the disk ; with incorrect boundary conditions , it quickly bounces back unphysically .",
    "let s suppose now that , early in the simulation , a portion of the cocoon backflow touches the disk at some radius @xmath219 . if the disk boundary condition insists on imposing a forwards speed @xmath220 to the material , we will get an increase in density due to the artificial compression of the coronal material",
    ". if the ejection speed @xmath71 is not large , a fast bounce - back will be avoided , and we will not get a false acceleration like before .",
    "nevertheless , we still get a localized region , close to the disk , where the density is abnormally large .",
    "this larger density will be associated with large localized @xmath39 , and it will have a large inertia ; the magneto - centrifugal acceleration will not be enough to lift the material up .",
    "the region around @xmath221 will be a hole in the acceleration front ; the jet will proceed forwards for both smaller and larger radii , but it will stagnate here . a succession of such holes would make the simulation look filamentary ; again , allowing the disk to absorb the backflow avoids this numerical effect .",
