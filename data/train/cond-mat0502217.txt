    "<S> we study the spatial fourier transform of the spin correlation function @xmath0 in paramagnetic quantum crystals by direct simulation of a 1d lattice of atoms interacting via a nearest - neighbor heisenberg exchange hamiltonian . since it is not practical to diagonalize the @xmath1 exchange hamiltonian for a lattice which is of sufficient size to study long - wavelength ( hydrodynamic ) fluctuations , we instead study the @xmath2 limit and treat each spin as a vector with a classical equation of motion . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations give a detailed picture of the correlation function @xmath0 and its time derivatives . at high polarization </S>",
    "<S> , there seems to be a hierarchy of frequency scales : the local exchange frequency , a wavelength - independent relaxation rate @xmath3 that vanishes at large polarization @xmath4 , and a wavelength - dependent spin - wave frequency @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a form for the correlation function which modifies the spin diffusion coefficients obtained in a moments calculation by cowan and mullin , who used a standard gaussian ansatz for the second derivative of the correlation function .    </S>",
    "<S> the heisenberg spin chain continues to be of the focus of much experimental and theoretical study ( see ref . and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> a number of new materials has been synthesized which appear to be nearly perfect experimental realizations of the spin-1/2 chain . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments have also pointed to the need for detailed theroeticals studies of the spin dynamics of the heisenberg chain . in its simplest form </S>",
    "<S> the model is defined by the hamiltonian h=_i , jj*s*_i _ j-_i bs^z_i [ ham ] where @xmath6 is the external magnetic field , @xmath7 is the nearest neighbor exchange integral , the second sum is over nearest neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> its low temperature ( @xmath8 ) behavior is controlled by the @xmath9 quantum critical point and is well - described by quantum field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the finite temperature dynamics are less understood . the infinite temperature regime has been studied theoretically , and numerically , but almost exclusively in the unpolarized @xmath10 case . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we focus on highly polaralized paramagnet at infinite temperature @xmath11 , but with @xmath12 finite . </S>",
    "<S> the 3-d version of the spin-1/2 system has been proposed as a model of spin transport in the paramagnetic hcp phase of solid @xmath13he.@xcite@xmath14@xcite    previously , we studied spin transport@xcite in a 2-d lattice model that demonstrated leggett - rice type behavior , i.e. , characterized by an exchange mean - field supporting damped spin - waves . </S>",
    "<S> the leggett equation@xcite was originally derived for paramagnetic fermi fluids , but it has been shown that it applies to the spin dynamics of any polarized system interacting via quantum exchange.@xcite whereas in the liquid longitudinal spin transport is due to particle motion and damping of the spin current is due to particle collisions , in a lattice of localized spins transport is due to exchange and damping is due to spin fluctuations . in the current paper we study 1-d chains and find another analogy with the fluid : a relaxation of the spin - current at high polarization , where the spin system begins to acts like a dilute gas with a mean free time @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we restrict our attention to longitudinal spin diffusion , although a similar description seems to apply for transverse spin transport ( the results are of a more preliminary nature , however ) . specifically , we study the polarization dependence of spatial fourier transform of the spin correlation function @xmath0 in the hydrodynamic limit @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> . the time derivatives of this function ( or the moments of its laplace transform ) give the diffusion coefficient @xmath17 , and the relaxation time @xmath15 . at high polarization , there seems to be a hierarchy of frequency scales : the local exchange frequency @xmath18 , a wavelength - independent relaxation rate @xmath19 that vanishes at large polarization @xmath4 , and a diffusive decay rate @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> since a lattice of @xmath21 spins involves @xmath22 quantum states , it is not practical to diagonalize the @xmath23 exchange hamiltonian for a lattice which is of sufficient size to study long - wavelength ( hydrodynamic ) fluctuations . instead , we take a commonly used approach @xcite@xmath24@xcite and study the @xmath25 limit and treat each spin as a vector @xmath26 with a classical equation of motion , ( * r*)=_*r*^ * s*(*r * ) ( * r*^ ) [ motion ] where the sum is over nearest neighbors and @xmath27 is the exchange frequency . for convenience , </S>",
    "<S> we have moved to the larmor frame , and have set the vector magnitude of the spins @xmath28 equal to @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> also , we found only quantitative differences between 1 and 2-d systems , so we have concentrated on 1-d systems , which are computationally less expensive , and for which theoretical results are easier to obtain . </S>",
    "<S> although it is known@xcite that the unpolarized chain exhibits anomolous diffusion @xmath30 with @xmath31 slightly less than 2 , this behavior does not seem to be a present at higher polarizations , where the fluctuations essentially pass through one another .    </S>",
    "<S> longitudinal diffusion was studied by simulating the motion of a hydrodynamic ( @xmath16 ) fluctuation @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> we define the correlation function@xcite g_q(t)= [ corr ] which is assumed to have an exponential decay @xmath33 as @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the brackets indicate an average over initial conditions sampled from an equilibrium ensemble .    . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) log - log plot of the spin diffusion coefficient @xmath17 vs. @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> form the longtime diffusive behavior and the microscopic relaxation time of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the last four points have a slope of @xmath37,width=480 ]    we briefly outline the procedure for calculating @xmath38 and its derivatives . first , an initial spin configuration was obtained by generating a lattice of randomly oriented spins @xmath39 with a boltzman distribution @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange energy was neglected in the boltzman factor , so the spins were initially uncorrelated . </S>",
    "<S> the spin configuration was then allowed to evolve according to eq.[motion ] , and the spin correlation function @xmath38 was calculated from the definition eq.[corr ] . the average </S>",
    "<S> was then performed over @xmath21 initial configurations where @xmath41 was typical . </S>",
    "<S> periodic boundary conditions were used and the length @xmath42 of the lattice was chosen to be much greater than the mean free path `` given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the maximum spin wave phase velocity , ( @xmath45 is the lattice spacing ) and @xmath15 is the ' ' mean free time \" ( defined below ) . </S>",
    "<S> the equation of motion was integrated with a fourth - order runge - kutta method , with time step @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the typical motion of a spin in a time step was 5 degrees or so . </S>",
    "<S> the conserved quantities such as the total energy , the polarization , and the individual spin magnitudes were found to be constant to a high degree of accuracy .        in simulations to study the short time behavior of @xmath38 and its derivatives </S>",
    "<S> the system was allowed to relax for a time greater than the microscopic relaxation time @xmath15 to remove any artifical effects of the uncorrelated initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the higher derivatives were , of course , a good deal noisier than @xmath0 data and up to @xmath47 simulations were even averaged in some cases , although these were short simulations to study short - time behavior .    in fig.1a </S>",
    "<S> the correlation function @xmath48 is shown for @xmath49 and is indistinguishable from @xmath50 . from this function </S>",
    "<S> we extract the spin diffusion coefficient @xmath51 the polarization dependence is shown in fig.1b , from which we find @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> we also get a detailed picture of the short - time behavior of the correlation function . in figs.2a - d </S>",
    "<S> we show the first four derivatives of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the surprising result is the fact that at high polarization the second derivative is not gaussian but has the form of a hydrodynamic correlation function @xmath53 , where @xmath15 is a polarization dependent relaxation time that diverges as @xmath54 and @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> ( it is easy to show from eqs.(2 - 3 ) that @xmath56 as @xmath54 . ) </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the first derivative relaxes _ exponentially _ to its quasi - steady value of @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a cut off time @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have the relation g_q(t_c1)=-d_q^2g_q(t_c1)=_0^t_c1g_q(t)dt = g(0)[g2tau ] giving @xmath60 which relates the hydrodynamic diffusive behavior to the microscopic behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> the fourth derivative evolves on an even shorter ( in fact the shortest possible ) time scale @xmath61 . for large polarizations @xmath62 has the form form @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is polarization dependent and @xmath65 as @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath66 ( more precisely to a value @xmath67 ) on a time scale @xmath68 , where here the cutoff time satisfies @xmath69 ( see fig.2b ) . assuming this form for @xmath62 we have the relation g_q(t_c2)=-=_0^t_c2g^iv_q(t)dt = g^iv_q(0)f(p ) [ g4tau ] putting this into the expression for @xmath70 we get our main result d _ [ d ]    next we compare our numerical results to the moments method calculations of cowan and mullin _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite@xmath24@xcite@xmath71@xcite , who considered a nearest - neighbor pair exchange hamiltonian to describe the quantum spin-1/2 dynamics of paramagnetic @xmath72he in its hcp phase , with a nearest - neighbor pair exchange hamiltonian . using a gaussian ansatz for the second derivative they found , for arbitrary polarization , @xmath73^{3/2}/[g_q^{iv}(0)]^{1/2}$ ] , which diverges like </S>",
    "<S> @xmath74 as @xmath4 . if we use eq.([d ] ) and their result that @xmath75 as @xmath4 , the divergence of @xmath17 would be modified , diverging instead at least like @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> this is still much slower than divergence seen in our numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> however , the divergence will be faster if the integral @xmath77 as @xmath4 , which from fig.2d seems entirely possible . </S>",
    "<S> in any event , our results shift the focus to the calculation of @xmath15 which depends on the short - time ( @xmath78 ) behavior of the fourth derivative . </S>"
