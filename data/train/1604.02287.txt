    "_ what were the body organs that you used the last time that you communicated with someone ?",
    "_ if we asked this strange question 200 years ago , the most likely answer would be : _",
    "`` my vocal cords''_. with the rise of the web and online communication , we are increasingly more likely to get another answer today : _",
    "`` my fingers''_. with more than 200 billion emails sent per day @xcite and textual communication being more frequent than voice calls in mobile phone usage @xcite , there is little doubt that the human - computer interface , in particular fingers and keyboards , plays an important role in online communication and the web in general .    * the qwerty effect * postulates that the keyboard layout influences word meanings by linking positivity to the use of the right hand and negativity to the use of the left hand . in @xcite for example ,",
    "jasmin and casasanto show that the qwerty effect manifests in offline small scale experiments , as human subjects rated those words more positively that were typed with more letters from the right side of the keyboard than words typed with more letters from the left @xcite .",
    "general lateralization effects explain the existence of the qwerty effect , including the positive connotation of the _ right _ @xcite and the positive effect of fluency that right - handed typers can experience when using the right hand more often .",
    "+    we measure the tendency to use right side letters through the right side ratio ( rsr ) , calculated as the amount of right side letters divided by the sum of right and left side letters in a text .",
    "figure [ fig : booksts]a shows the general pattern of hand usage in the qwerty layout and an example of how the rsr is calculated .",
    "figure [ fig : booksts]b shows the rsr for english books of the google books corpus @xcite published each available year since 1900 , illustrating a general upwards trend of this ratio that specially speeds up in the early 1990s .",
    "the vertical red bar shows the rsr computed for a corpus of english text on the web @xcite , displaying a higher tendency of right side letters on the web as compared to books . what remains unknown from this preliminary analysis",
    "is whether the increasing prevalence of words with a higher rsr on the web translates into evidence for the qwerty effect .",
    "we thus set out to study _ whether evidence for ( or against ) the qwerty effect can be found on the web_. in other words , we want to test the hypothesis that textual web content with more right side letters is evaluated more positively by users .",
    "in addition , we also want to study boundary conditions of the qwerty effect on the web , i.e. the extent to which it can be observed , and its limitations .",
    "building on existing methods used to analyze small scale experimental data @xcite , we perform a large scale confirmatory analysis to test if the qwerty effect manifests on the web .",
    "we test if the qwerty effect is present when _ ( i ) decoding text _ ,",
    "i.e. when evaluating items with names or titles ( e.g. imdb movie titles ) . for that",
    ", we gather eleven datasets of online media , recording how content is evaluated via votes , likes , or ratings . using that data",
    ", we explore the existence of a hand - meaning relationship through a series of statistical tests , including permutation tests , robust regression , and control for linguistic and contextual factors that could influence the effect .",
    "we also test the qwerty effect when _ ( ii ) encoding text _ ,",
    "i.e. when online users write text to express certain meaning ( e.g. amazon reviews ) . for that",
    ", we analyze four additional datasets of online product reviews that are accompanied by a summary of their evaluative meaning as a star rating . on these datasets , we test the existence of a relationship between star ratings of a review and the amounts of right and left side letters of its text .    we find mostly consistent , significant evidence for the existence of the qwerty effect across 15 web datasets , both on an encoding and decoding level . more specifically , we find that the ratio of right side letters has a normalized coefficient between 1 and 3% of the standard deviation of average evaluations given by users , and the amount of left - hand letters in a review are associated with decreases of up to 17% of a star per 100 letters ( more details in section [ sec : encoding ] ) .",
    "these apparently small effect sizes are characteristic of psycholinguistic studies , where word frequencies usually variate at the 1% level @xcite .",
    "we analyze the interaction between these effects and linguistic and contextual variables , finding robust evidence of the effect against a range of plausible confounds .",
    "our analysis also reveals some interesting limitations of the qwerty effect , which can weaken for popular web content or can even be reversed in the language of very particular contexts .",
    "the results reported in this paper are limited to english , and our models are only testable when explicit positive and negative ratings are present .",
    "our contributions are two - fold : ( i ) to the best of our knowledge , this is the first large scale attempt to study the existence of the qwerty effect on the web .",
    "( ii ) in addition to decoding studies which have been performed by previous research in small scale , offline experiments , we are also testing if the qwerty effect exists when encoding text .",
    "overall , our contribution lies in the execution of a confirmatory study to test the extent of the qwerty effect on the web , and its conditionants .",
    "* the qwerty effect : * the qwerty effect was first reported in secondary analyses of word rating experiments @xcite , testing the relationship between the valence expressed in a word and its difference between the amounts of right and left side letters in the word .",
    "the explanation of the effect existing due to the keyboard is specially consistent , as the effect is stronger for words created after the popularization of the keyboard and even for pseudowords without explicit meaning @xcite . besides this robust evidence in experimental tests ,",
    "the state - of - research on this effect is limited in two ways : first , previous research focused on word interpretation ( decoding ) and did not test the existence of the effect when writing text .",
    "second , results so far only show the existence of the effect in a precise controlled scenario , leaving open whether it appears in practice , for example if products with _ the `` right '' name _ have an advantage @xcite .",
    "we aim at contributing to our knowledge of the qwerty effect in a way that complements these two limitations , through a large scale observational analysis of the effect on the web that includes both encoding and decoding scenarios .",
    "the fact that we can not generally perceive the relationship between hand use and meaning suggests that the effect must be very subtle , difficult to measure with limited data , and easy to distort through experimental biases .",
    "one of our aims is to test if the effect exists when encoding , which is difficult to measure in the laboratory , since it would require participants to produce large amounts of text . to date , the only observational evidence of the effect during encoding focuses on baby names , testing if there is a bias towards right side letters when naming newborns .",
    "results for this case are mixed , while there is a general increase of right side letter use in us baby names @xcite , a precise test of a correlation between right side letter use and baby name popularity yields negative results @xcite .",
    "* explanations for the qwerty effect : * _ how can typing influence word meaning ? _ two possible mechanisms can be identified in the literature .",
    "first , the fluency experienced when using the right hand and its associated pleasantness can drive right - hand typers to use right keys when expressing positivity .",
    "since the majority of society is right - handed and the meaning of words is normative , a general association between right - handed words and positive meanings can emerge @xcite .",
    "second , the qwerty effect could be explained by general lateralization : individuals have implicit biases to associate right to good and left to bad , even across cultures @xcite .",
    "in fact , lateralization might be biologically grounded , as experiments with newborn chicken show faster learning rates when positive stimuli are located on the right @xcite .",
    "furthermore , smartphone usage is linked to increased finger sensitivity at the neural level @xcite , motivating the explanation that the qwerty effect could be built on the combination of biological and technological factors .",
    "* communication of emotion : * among the possible ways to measure meaning , our research question deals with evaluation , formalized for example in the semantic differential @xcite , and commonly named `` _ _ valence _ _ '' in emotion research @xcite .",
    "the valence associated to a word or a text measures the degree of pleasure or displeasure , the degree of positivity or negativity that the word or text means .",
    "the communication of emotions is integrated in a wider perspective in the _ hyperlens model _ of emotions , and its composed of two components : ( i ) encoding , in which the transmitter turns emotional meaning into signs , and ( ii ) decoding , when the receiver transforms those signs back into meanings @xcite . in this model , encoding and decoding",
    "happen in the presence of individual feedback and social and cultural contexts , considering emotions as interpersonal ( social ) phenomena that are embodied and not only present in the mind .",
    "the case of the qwerty effect is specially interesting for the concept of embodied emotions , since it proposes a fundamental change in emotional communication induced by a physical constraint , the keyboard layout , and not by any cognitive phenomenon .",
    "* expression of sentiment on the web : * online human - computer interaction has an important transformative power in society @xcite , changing our attitudes @xcite , and leaving traces that allow us to understand human behavior like never before @xcite . through the digital traces of the web we can learn social dynamics of emotions , for example the daily patterns of emotional expression @xcite , the emergence of collective emotions @xcite , or the spreading of emotional messages @xcite .",
    "fundamental properties of language can also be analyzed this way , for example the existence of positive biases across languages @xcite , the assortativity of subjective expression @xcite , and the community components of language @xcite .",
    "analyzing the content of online data has promising applications through sentiment analysis , from monitoring reactions to politically relevant events @xcite to financial trading based on emotional expression @xcite .",
    "thus , understanding how language might be influenced by technology is not only interesting as a fundamental research question , but has implications for the application of online data analysis .",
    "our aim is to test the qwerty effect in a wide variety of settings , including possible variations of language style and communication mechanisms .    [ [ datasets ] ] datasets + + + + + + + +    to test the effect , we need datasets that contain items ( products , movies , videos , etc ) that are rated in an evaluative manner , with both positive and negative feedback that can be aggregated to a valence score . if only positive feedback or views are present , the question would become about popularity rather than about evaluation .",
    "in addition , we need items to be named with a character string that is used to refer to them . for example , product names or movie titles fall on this class , while summaries or question formulations do not constitute symbols that could be affected by the qwerty effect . since the scope of this research is to try the qwerty effect as it has been formulated for the english keyboard layout , we will focus on english - speaking online communities and filter out non - english data in case of its existence .",
    "a summary of these datasets is shown on table [ tab : data1 ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results shown in table [ tab : encoding ] are robust to permutation and bootstrapping tests .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ fig : encoding ] shows the density functions of the estimates of @xmath0 and @xmath1 after permuting the data and in bootstrap samples . permuted estimates for the first three datasets",
    "are centered around @xmath2 and do not reach the mean of bootstrap estimates for three of the datasets , and the their distribution of estimates in the bootstrap samples is significantly far from @xmath2 .",
    "in our studies , we find robust evidence for the qwerty effect both at the point of text interpretation ( decoding ) as well as at the point of text creation ( encoding ) .",
    "we explicitly avoided selecting on the dependent variable by including a wide range of datasets in which the effect could be tested .",
    "this way , we analyzed 15 datasets ( 11 in the decoding study and 4 in the encoding study ) from 11 different online media to obtain cross - platform insights .",
    "we found robust evidence for the existence of the qwerty effect when reading texts ( decoding ) in 8 datasets , and we learned that the effect might be reversed under particular conditions .",
    "furthermore , we found significant evidence during writing texts ( encoding ) in three datasets , showing that positive reviews tend to contain more right side letters and negative reviews more left side letters .",
    "[ [ limitations ] ] limitations + + + + + + + + + + +    despite the general pattern of a positive right side coefficient , two cases showed non - significant positive effects : epinions and bookcrossing .",
    "one explanation for this could be a lack of statistical power in our strict methods , or the limited size of these two datasets . for the case of bookcrossing , the effect could also be absent due to books existing before widespread keyboard use .",
    "another interesting exception appears in one of the adult video communities , which was subject to possible sampling biases in the listing of the sitemap . that dataset showed a strong cutoff on video dates and might have had unpopular videos removed .",
    "if this were true , the negative effect would be consistent with the interaction that we found in amazon for sales rank : the qwerty effect weakens or even reverses when popularity or marketing forces are in play .",
    "in any case , we must note that we lack a testable conjecture that explains how the qwerty effect might interact with popularity and under which conditions .    the existence of the qwerty effect in the datasets we have studied however does not imply that it has to exist in every possible context , and its absence in a community that discusses a particular type of content does not constitute a rejection of the effect in general .",
    "future work might investigate the effect in additional web datasets on other types of products or entities , such as beer @xcite or wine @xcite , which were not available to us during the course of our study .",
    "we complemented previous experimental studies with observational tests , and thus our contribution suffers the typical limitations of observational , non - obtrusive studies .",
    "first , we did not have any degree of control on the conditions of our tests and we could not study if the same content would be evaluated differently depending on its name .",
    "natural experiments are a promising avenue to combine experimental and observational methods , but we ultimately need experiments in which , _ all things being equal _ , show a dependence between evaluation and right side letter measurements .",
    "second , besides our illustration of the rsr on books , we did not reach timespans long enough to test the emergence of the qwerty effect in a longitudinal manner .",
    "this point is specially challenging , as we are dealing with a property of language that can not be simply reset in a group of individuals .",
    "third , our observational methods only test the effect in an aggregated manner , leaving open the question of individual idiographic differences depending on demographic conditions like age or gender , on factors of human - computer interaction like handedness or other layouts , and on psychological factors like personality or locus of control .",
    "our work focused on english - speaking online media and filtered out non - english content .",
    "we must highlight that this contains the assumption that the qwerty keyboard layout is widely used in those communities , which might not be the case when non - native english speakers communicate online .",
    "further research might also consider other languages and keyboard layouts , but this might not be straightforward , as languages coexist in some online media .",
    "it is also important to note that the normative nature of language can cancel out minority effects like left - handed users or other language keyboards , in line with the findings that the effect can also appear in experiments with left - handed users and other layouts @xcite . while we include a wide variety of linguistic and contextual controls , we did not account for more complex effects such as alphabetic ordering effects or finger alternations @xcite .",
    "in addition , language is more than just letters , and nonlinear hierarchical interactions should be tested at the level of words and phrases .    while our work tests the existence of the qwerty effect",
    ", we do not evaluate its predictive power .",
    "our regression approach allows us to quantify the strength of the coupling between evaluative content and the amounts of right and left side letters in item names and review texts .",
    "as suggested by the subconscious aspect of the effect , the strength of the right side ratio was very small , in the line of other influential results in psycholinguistics that reveal variations of term frequencies below 1% @xcite .",
    "a small change in emotional language can also have large implications , for example driving social factors of emotions beyond critical thresholds that produce macroscopic phenomena @xcite .",
    "[ [ dactilar - onomatopoeias ] ] dactilar onomatopoeias + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the qwerty effect is a special case of _ onomatopoeia _ , a symbol class that violates the general arbitrarity of the relationship between signs and meanings @xcite .",
    "this kind of relationships are not new and are well documented in linguistics , in general with respect of how words phonetically imitate the sounds or objects they signify .",
    "for example , low voice tones are used to refer to large objects ( e.g. `` huge '' ) and high pitches to small objects ( e.g. `` tiny '' ) , resembling how large cavities produce lower sounds ( e.g. contrabass vs violin ) . since the organs used to articulate words online are our fingers , we can talk about _ dactilar onomatopoeias _ that connect hands and fingers with meanings .",
    "pronouncing words with the vocal tract does not have any precise spatial orientation , but using a keyboard to communicate introduces the asymmetry of the keyboard layout in the communication process .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this study provides first evidence of the extent of the qwerty effect on the web . in our datasets",
    "we confirm that products with more right side letters and fewer left side letters have higher average ratings , as suggested by @xcite . as an application to marketing ,",
    "our results support the concept that _ the `` right '' name _ might provide certain yet limited advantages .",
    "furthermore , we show that this extends to movie titles and youtube videos , where the presence of the effect in the ratio of likes was particularly robust .",
    "our exploration of confounds and interactions showed how the effect diminished for amazon products with infrequent words and very high sales .",
    "we also found an interesting exception of an inverse effect that calls for further research to understand how contextual properties can influence hand to meaning associations .",
    "finally , we tested the effect during encoding through the text of product reviews and their star ratings , finding first evidence that positive meanings are written with more right side letters .",
    "our work has implications for wider research in psychology and computational social science .",
    "the existence of the effect is an example of a combination of collective social factors and embodied emotions within the hyperlens model of emotions @xcite .",
    "our results can also be understood as an example of lateralization , not only in the metaphoric sense but also as a psychological phenomenon . with respect to online interaction , the qwerty effect is one example of social components in the expression of sentiment , in line with assortativity of happiness @xcite and emotion - dependent cascading behavior @xcite .",
    "the right and left side letter quantities that we measured are promising with respect to tasks that involve semantic annotation or sentiment analysis .",
    "future sentiment analysis tools might explore whether adding the right side ratio as a variable improves prediction quality .",
    "in addition , it will be interesting to explore whether and how the qwerty effect might interact with popularity and spreading processes , testing if messages with more right side letters are shared more frequently or trigger longer discussions .",
