    "conductance ( conductivity ) measurements belong to the easiest and most direct experiments which can be carried out .",
    "they attract a lot of attention , due to the fact that in general they can be performed without perturbing very much the behaviour of the system , e.g. a rigid - lattice bulk metal , such that the uncertainty of experimental artefacts is reduced to a minimum . there",
    "exist various well - known theoretical descriptions , such as semi - classical transport theories ( landauer @xcite and boltzmann - drude @xcite ) , dynamical linear - response theory @xcite and also green function linear - response theory @xcite . to carry out the latter , in particular at finite temperature ,",
    "is still poorly understood in generality @xcite , even in 1 + 1 space - time dimensions @xcite .",
    "since recent experimental progress allows conductance measurements also in 1 + 1 space - time dimensions @xcite , one can on the theoretical side fully exploit the special features of low dimensionality .",
    "it is in particular very suggestive to exploit the full scope of non - perturbative techniques which have been developed in the context of integrable quantum field theories in 1 + 1 space - time dimensions , such as the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) @xcite and the form factor bootstrap approach @xcite . generalizing the landauer transport picture",
    "a proposal for the conductance through a quantum wire with a defect ( impurity ) has been made in @xcite @xmath0 ,   \\label{1}\\ ] ] which we only modify to accommodate parity breaking , known to occur in integrable lattice models , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this means in particular we allow the transmission amplitudes to be different for a particle of type @xmath1 with charge @xmath2 passing with rapidity @xmath3 through a defect of type @xmath4 from the left @xmath5 and right @xmath6 .",
    "the density distribution function @xmath7 , being a function the temperature @xmath8 , and the potential at the left @xmath9 and right @xmath10 constriction of the wire , can be determined by means of the tba .",
    "we have already restricted ( [ 1 ] ) to the abelian ( diagonal ) situation .",
    "it is clear that the effect resulting from the defect is most interesting when @xmath11 , which requires the occurrence of simultaneous transmission and reflection ( see ( [ u2 ] ) , ( [ c2 ] ) ) . in this paper",
    "we will therefore be mainly interested in that situation .",
    "one may adapt ( [ 1 ] ) also to the case of pure reflection , which physically describes the influence of the constriction to the conducting process . from the previous statement",
    "it is clear that such boundary theories are only interesting in this physical context when they are non - abelian .",
    "the other prominent way of determining the conductance is a result from linear response theory , which yields an expression for the conductance in form of the fourier transform of the current - current two - point correlation function .",
    "this kubo formula has been adopted to the situation with a boundary @xcite .",
    "as we mentioned , this will only capture effects coming from the constriction of the wire , we propose here a generalization to the analogous situation as described in ( [ 1 ] ) , i.e. when a defect is present    @xmath12    here the defect operator @xmath13 enters in - between the two currents @xmath14 within the temperature and mass @xmath15 dependent correlation function .",
    "the matsubara frequency is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "the main purpose of this manuscript is to compare the two alternative descriptions ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) for massive bulk theories with a defect which allows for simultaneous reflection and transmission .",
    "there exist various investigations , e.g. , @xcite for conformal ( massless ) theories with defect , which exploit the original folding idea of wong and affleck @xcite .",
    "the idea is that a conformal field theory with a _",
    "purely _ transmitting or reflecting defect can be mapped into a boundary theory , i.e. a theory living in half space , which has the advantage that the full restriction of modular invariance can be exploited in the construction of boundary states as pioneered by cardy @xcite .",
    "since this folding idea relies on the vanishing of either the reflection or transmission , our considerations do in general not reduce to that set up , even in the conformal limit . as was already pointed out in @xcite , and as can be seen directly from ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) , in that case the conductance is less interesting because it is either zero or perfect for abelian theories .     in section 2",
    "we outline the procedure of how the defect scattering matrices may be determined , since they are needed as input in both approaches . in section 3",
    "we newly formulate the defect tba equations and use them to determine the density distribution functions .",
    "we evaluate numerically the landauer formula ( [ 1 ] ) for various defects and provide some analytical approximations in certain regimes . in section 4",
    "we propose a kubo formula ( [ 2 ] ) for a configuration in which an impurity is present and compute the current - current two - point correlation functions occurring in there by means of a form factor expansion .",
    "we find very good agreement between ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) for the complex free fermion theory with various types of defects .",
    "our final conclusions and an outlook into open problems is provided in section 5 .",
    "an essential input required in both non - perturbative methods which are exploited to compute the conductance ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) , that is the tba and the form factor bootstrap approach , respectively , is the knowledge of the exact ( defect ) scattering matrix .",
    "it is one of the most intriguing facts of two dimensional quantum field theories that these matrices can be determined exactly to all orders in perturbation theory . in the following section",
    "we will recall how much ( little ) of this approach can be carried over to the situation when defects are present and compute explicitly the transmission and reflection amplitudes for a variety of concrete defects .      a cornerstone in the context of integrable models in 1 + 1 space - time dimensions are the yang - baxter equations @xcite .",
    "they can be derived most easily simply by exploiting the associativity of the so - called zamolodchikov - faddeev ( zf ) algebra @xcite and its extended version which includes an additional generator representing a boundary @xcite or a defect @xcite . indicating particle types by latin and degrees of freedom of the impurity by greek letters , the `` braiding '' ( exchange ) relations of annihilation operators @xmath17 of a particle of type @xmath1 moving with rapidity @xmath3 and defect operators @xmath18 in the state @xmath19 can be written as @xmath20 the bulk scattering matrix is indicated by @xmath21 , and the left / right reflection and transmission amplitudes through the defect are denoted by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "we employed einstein s sum convention , that is we assume sums over doubly occurring indices .",
    "we suppress the explicit mentioning of the dependence of @xmath18 on the position in space and assume for the time being that it is included in @xmath19 . for the treatment of a single defect",
    "this is not relevant , but it will become important when we consider multiple defects .",
    "the same relations hold when we replace the annihilation operators by the creation operators @xmath24 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath21 replaced by their complex conjugates .",
    "the algebra ( [ z1])-([z2 ] ) can be used to derive various relations amongst the scattering amplitudes .",
    "using extended zf - algebra twice leads to the constraints @xmath25 the same equations also hold after performing a parity transformation , that is for @xmath26 and @xmath27 in ( [ u2])-([u3 ] ) . from the associativity of the extended zf - algebra one derives the equations @xcite @xmath28s(\\hat{\\theta}_{12})[\\bbb{i}\\otimes r_{\\beta } ^{\\gamma } ( \\theta _ { 2})]\\!\\!\\!\\ ! & = & \\!\\!\\!\\![\\bbb{i}\\otimes r_{\\alpha } ^{\\beta } ( \\theta _ { 2})]s(\\hat{\\theta}_{12})[\\bbb{i}\\otimes r_{\\beta } ^{\\gamma } ( \\theta _ { 1})]s(\\theta _ { 12}),\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ ,   \\label{ybt1 } \\\\ s(\\theta _ { 12})[\\bbb{i}\\otimes r_{\\alpha } ^{\\beta } ( \\theta _ { 1})]s(\\hat{\\theta}_{12})[\\bbb{i}\\otimes t_{\\beta } ^{\\gamma } ( \\theta _ { 2})]\\!\\!\\!\\ ! & = & \\!\\!\\!\\!r_{\\beta } ^{\\gamma } ( \\theta _ { 1})\\otimes t_{\\alpha } ^{\\beta } ( \\theta _ { 2 } ) ,   \\label{ybt2 } \\\\ s(\\theta _ { 12})[t_{\\alpha } ^{\\beta } ( \\theta _ { 2})\\otimes t_{\\beta } ^{\\gamma } ( \\theta _ { 1})]\\!\\!\\!\\ ! & = & \\!\\!\\!\\![t_{\\alpha } ^{\\beta } ( \\theta _ { 1})\\otimes t_{\\beta } ^{\\gamma } ( \\theta _ { 2})]s(\\theta _ { 12 } ) ,   \\label{ybt3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we employed the convention @xmath29 for the tensor product and abbreviated the rapidity sum @xmath30 and difference @xmath31 .",

    "the latter relations in ( [ c2 ] ) simply result by considering the relations for @xmath21 while letting one of the particles freeze , i.e. , setting its rapidity to zero , and viewing it as a defect .",
    "relations ( [ c1 ] ) are obtainable in a similar fashion as the interpretation put forward in @xcite .",
    "our equations ( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) disagree slightly from the crossing relations in @xcite , which is due to the fact that when parity is broken real analyticity is replaced by hermitian analyticity @xcite .",
    "later on in our example , this will also be reflected in the representation of the free fermion field ( [ free ] ) , being dirac rather than majorana .",
    "there is of course no consequence of this choice of conventions on the physics , since the ambiguity just exploits the fact that only the moduli of these amplitudes are observable .",
    "similar as for the bulk scattering matrices an additional powerful constraint results from the singularity structure of the defect scattering amplitudes .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the defect does not admit any excited state once one demands a simultaneous occurrence of reflection and transmission .",
    "supposing that the defect scattering matrices have a pole on the imaginary axis at @xmath46 , the corresponding residues are therefore constraint as @xmath47 the intervals @xmath48 are understood to be @xmath49@xmath50 .",
    "hence , there is no pole with positive residue in the physical sheet .      assuming that we have determined the defect scattering matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 for a single defect , for instance by solving the consistency equations in the previous subsection , it is straightforward to use them in order to compute the related quantities for several defects .",
    "this type of situation is of interest since , unlike for a single defect , it leads to the occurrence of resonance phenomena and when the number of defects tends to infinity even to band structures .",
    "let us therefore commence by exploiting the extended zf - algebra ( [ z1])-([z2 ] ) for a double defect .",
    "for the reasons mentioned in the introduction we are interested in the situation when @xmath22 and @xmath23 are simultaneously non - vanishing , and in the light of the result ( [ s ] ) , we shall therefore focus on the diagonal case from now onwards .",
    "we compute @xmath51 where we have now introduced overall transmission and reflection amplitudes corresponding to two defects @xmath52 the term @xmath53^{-1}=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } ( r_{i}^{\\beta } ( \\theta ) \\tilde{r}_{i}^{\\alpha } ( \\theta ) ) ^{n}$ ] results from the infinite number of reflections which we have in - between the two defects , well known from fabry - perot type devices of classical and quantum optics .",
    "for the case @xmath54 the expressions ( [ tr ] ) and ( [ tr2 ] ) coincide with the formulae proposed in @xcite .",
    "when absorbing the space dependent phase factor into the defect matrices , the explicit example presented in @xcite for the free fermion perturbed with the energy operator agree almost for @xmath54  with the general formulae ( [ tr ] ) .",
    "they disagree in the sense that the equality of @xmath55 and @xmath56 does not hold for generic @xmath57 as stated in @xcite .",
    "it is now straightforward to extend the expressions to an arbitrary number of defects , say @xmath58 , in a recursive manner @xmath59 for convenience we encoded here the defect degrees of freedom into the vector @xmath60 .",
    "similar expressions also hold for @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "it is clear that from the knowledge of the single defect amplitudes we are now in the position to compute the corresponding quantities for multiple defects just by nesting successively the expressions ( [ ttr ] ) and ( [ ttr2 ] ) for increasing values of @xmath58 into each other .",
    "nonetheless , in general one does not succeed to provide simple analytical expressions for  @xmath63-defect amplitudes and a different description is useful .    alternatively , we can define , in analogy to standard quantum mechanical methods ( see e.g. @xcite ) , a transmission matrix which takes the particle from one side of the defect to the other . from the braiding relations ( [ z1 ] ) and ( [ z2 ] )",
    ", we obtain with the help of the unitarity relations ( [ u2 ] ) and ( [ u3 ] ) @xmath64 with @xmath65 this means alternatively to the recursive way ( [ ttr ] ) and ( [ ttr2 ] ) , we can also compute the multi - defect transmission and reflection amplitudes as @xmath66 one may convince oneself that this formulation is indeed the same as ( [ ttr ] ) and ( [ ttr2 ] ) .",
    "it has , however , the virtue that it allows for a more elegant computation of the band structures .",
    "in particular , it is most suitable for numerical computations , since it just involves matrix multiplications rather than recurrence operations .",
    "let us now consider the case in which all the defects are of the same type @xmath19 , equidistantly separated by an amount @xmath67 and send @xmath68 .",
    "first of all we have to include now explicitly the dependence of the defect on its position into the discussion .",
    "we assume @xmath69 ^{l}q_{ny}^{-1}\\,,\\quad q_{y}=\\left (   \\begin{array}{cc } e^{iky } & 0 \\\\   0 & e^{-iky } \\end{array } \\right ) \\ , ,   \\label{yx}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 corresponds to the wavevector of the lattice .",
    "taking then @xmath71 this accommodates bloch s theorem ( e.g. , @xcite ) for the relativistic set - up .",
    "the simple requirement , that the product of transmission matrices @xmath72 remains finite , leads now in the usual way to a restriction for the allowed energies , that is to band structures . to see when this is the case we can exploit the r.h.s . of the first equation in ( [ yx ] ) and",
    "diagonalize the matrix @xmath73 .",

    "\\label{bands}\\ ] ] in other words particles are only allowed to travel in the system with rapidities for which the inequality ( [ bands ] ) holds . in conclusion , this means the determination of the transmission amplitudes for a single defect is sufficient to determine multiple defects and the energy band structure .",
    "let us illustrate the working of this general formulae with a concrete example .",
    "the continuous version of the 1 + 1 dimensional free fermion ( ising model ) with a line of defect was first treated in @xcite .",
    "thereafter it has also been considered in @xcite and @xcite from a different point of view . in @xcite",
    "the defect line has the form of the energy operator and in @xcite also a perturbation in form of a single fermion has been considered . in this manuscript",
    "we want to enlarge the class of perturbations having in mind to obtain various different kinds of structural and physical behaviours .",
    "let us consider the lagrangian density for a complex free fermion @xmath77 with @xmath78 defects ] ] @xmath79 where we describe the defect by the functions @xmath80 which we assume to be linear in the fermi fields @xmath81 and @xmath77 . in the following we will restrict ourselves mainly to the case of equidistantly distributed defects of the same type , i.e. @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "unfortunately , it follows from the arguments outlined in section 2.1 , that when one is seeking a situation with simultaneously occurring reflection and transmission the constraining equations for diagonal bulk scattering matrices reduce simply to unitarity and crossing .",
    "these equations are , however , not restrictive enough by themselves to fix @xmath22 and @xmath23 and therefore one has to resort to alternative arguments .",
    "for instance one may proceed in analogy to standard quantum mechanical potential scattering theory ( see also @xcite ) and construct the amplitudes by adequate matching conditions on the field .",
    "we consider now a single defect at the origin which suffices , since multiple defect amplitudes can be constructed from the single defect ones , according to the arguments of the previous section .",
    "we decompose the fields of the bulk theory as @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 , with @xmath88 being the heavyside step function , and substitute this ansatz into the equations of motion .",
    "this way we obtain the constraints @xmath89 using here for the left ( @xmath90 ) and right ( @xmath91 ) parts of @xmath77 the fourier decomposition of the free field @xmath92 with @xmath93 and the weyl spinors @xmath94 we can substitute them into the constraint ( [ bcon ] ) . treating the equations obtained in this manner componentwise , stripping off the integrals , we can bring them thereafter into the form @xmath95 the creation and annihilation operators @xmath96 play in ( [ z0 ] ) and ( [ z1/2 ] ) the role of the zf - algebra generators in view of the usual fermionic anti - commutation relations @xmath97 , @xmath98 . when including the defect operator in the equations ( [ m1 ] ) and ( [ m2 ] ) , on the right / left for @xmath99-subscript , they acquire precisely the form of the extended zf - algebra ( [ z1])-([z2 ] ) , such that one can read off directly the reflection and transmission amplitudes .",

    "we have now enough examples at hand to use them in the following to determine the conductance in a multiparticle system , which we shall do in two alternative ways .",
    "the most intuitive way to compute the conductance is via landauer transport theory @xcite .",

    ", we have to quantify the overall balance of particles of type @xmath1 and anti - particles @xmath178 carrying opposite charges @xmath179  at the end of the wire at different potentials .",

    "we assume that there is no effect coming from the constrictions of the wire , i.e. they are purely transmitting surfaces with @xmath182 .",

    "a short comment is needed on the validity of ( [ i11 ] ) .",
    "apparently it suggests that when the parity between left and right scattering is broken , there is the possibility of a net current even when an external source is absent . in this picture",
    "we have of course not taken into account that charged particles moving through the defect will alter the potential , such that we did in fact not describe a perpetuum mobile .",
    "thus the limitation of our analysis is that @xmath188 has to be much larger than the change in the potential induced by the moving particles .",

    "the expressions in ( [ i11 ] ) tend to zero for vanishing chemical potential difference such that the limit in ( [ g ] ) is non - trivial .",
    "thus from the knowledge of the transmission matrix and the density distribution function we can compute the conductance .",
    "having already described how @xmath190 can be determined , we will now explain how @xmath191 can be evaluated by exploiting the integrability of the theory .      the thermodynamic bethe ansatz is a powerful tool which may be used to compute various thermodynamic properties of multi - particle systems which interact via a factorizing scattering matrix @xcite and some chosen statistics .",

    "the two signs in ( [ ds ] ) capture the breaking of parity invariance in the limiting case , i.e. the two equations in ( [ lba ] ) correspond to taking the particle either clockwise or anti - clockwise around the world line as formulated for the parity breaking case for the first time in @xcite .",
    "we do not expect to recover from here the equations for a purely reflecting boundary which were suggested in @xcite , since the equations ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) do not make sense in the limit @xmath204 . for @xmath205 i.e. the free boson and fermion , we can exploit the fact that ( [ ban ] ) with ( [ ds ] ) look formally precisely like the bethe ansatz equations for a purely transmitting defect .",
    "if we want to exploit this analogy we should of course be concerned about the question whether @xmath206 is a meromorphic function .",

    "let us now carry out the thermodynamic limit in the usual way , namely by increasing the particle number and the system size in such a way that their mutual ratio remains finite .",
    "the amount of defects is kept constant in this limit , such that there is no contribution to the tba - equations from the defect in that situation , see also @xcite where the same argument was employed .",

    "it is straightforward to extend the expression ( [ massl ] ) to the case when the assumption on @xmath263 in ( [ 44 ] ) is relaxed and to the case with different values of @xmath67 . to proceed further we need to specify the defect .",
    "let us first consider the easiest example , which supports the general working of the method .",
    "when the defect is transparent , i.e. , @xmath135 , we can compute the expression for the conductance ( [ gg ] ) directly in the large temperature limit and obtain the well known behaviour @xcite @xmath267 alternatively we obtain the expression ( [ hh ] ) also from equation ( [ g0 ] ) and ( [ ffe ] ) . in the massless limit of ( [ massl ] )",

    "we simply get @xmath272 since the amplitudes do not depend on the rapidities , the tba - kernel is zero and there is no contribution from this defect to the free energy , even unit length .      for this defect the computation of the conductance according to ( [ gg ] )",
    "is more involved .",
    "the results of our numerical analysis of the expression ( [ gg ] ) are depicted in figure 4 .",
    "figure 4 : conductance @xmath274  for the complex free fermion with the energy operator defects as a function of the inverse temperature @xmath275 for fixed effective coupling constant @xmath112  and ( a ) for varying amounts of defects @xmath276 .",

    "first of all it is naturally to be expected that when we increase the number of defects the resistance will grow .",
    "this is confirmed , as for fixed temperature and increasing number of defects , the conductance decreases .",
    "second we see several well extended plateaux .",
    "they can be reproduced with the analytical expressions obtained in the massless limit ( [ massl ] ) . to be able to compare with ( [ gg ] ) we re - introduce atomic units for convenience ,",
    "i.e. @xmath278 . for a single defect there is only one plateaux and from ( [ massl ] ) we obtain with ( [ lr0 ] ) @xmath279 for @xmath280 the value @xmath281 is well reproduced in figure 4(a ) .",
    "the lower lying plateaux correspond to the region when @xmath259 . in that case",

    "finally we have to explain the reason for the increase from one to the next plateaux and why the curves are shifted precisely in the way as indicated in figure 4(b ) when we change the distance between the defects .",
    "this phenomenon is attributed to resonances as we shall discuss in more detail in the next subsection .      in @xcite we demonstrated that resonances may be described similarly as unstable particles .",
    "the latter provide an intuitively very clear picture which explains the relatively sharp onset of the conductance with increasing temperature .",
    "the temperature at which this onset occurs , say @xmath289 can be attributed directly to the energy scale at which the unstable particle is formed , since then it starts to participate in the conducting process . the breit - wigner formula @xcite constitutes in this case a relation for the mass @xmath290 and the decay width @xmath291 of an unstable particle .",
    "supposing that in the scattering process between particles of type @xmath1 and @xmath41 an unstable particle can be formed , this is reflected by a pole in @xmath292 at @xmath293 .",
    "then , for large values of the resonance parameter @xmath35 one may approximate @xmath294 , one should observe that the quantities @xmath295 and @xmath296 remain invariant .",
    "accordingly , this creation of the unstable particle should be reflected in the conductance as @xmath297 this means we can control the position of the onset in the conductance by @xmath290 and its extension in the temperature direction by @xmath291 . for a model which possesses unstable particles we found indeed such a behaviour @xcite . from the data of the previous subsections we find that the conductance scales as @xmath298 for @xmath299 .",
    "then the comparison with ( [ m12 ] ) suggests that we can relate the distance between the two defects to the resonance parameter as @xmath300const@xmath301 . from the maxima in @xmath302",
    "we may identify various @xmath35s and in fact in this case the net result can be attributed to two resonances @xcite .      up to now , we have observed that we always obtain essentially two plateaux in the conductance , no matter how many ( @xmath303 ) and what type of defects we implement .",
    "the natural question arising at this point is whether it is possible to have a set up which leads to a more involved plateaux structure ?",
    "it is clear that if we had many defects in a row separated far enough from each other such that the relaxation time of the passing particles is so large that they could be treated as single rather than multiple defects , then any desired type of multiple plateau structure could be obtained . in this case",
    "the conductance is simply the sum of the expressions one has for each defect independently .",
    "recalling the origin of the different plateaux , there is another slightly less obvious option .",
    "the density distribution function @xmath304 is a peaked function of the rapidity and if the resonances in @xmath305 would be separated far enough , such that they are resolved by @xmath304 , we would also get a multiple plateaux pattern .",
    "however , tuning the distance between the defects or the coupling constant will merely translate the position of the resonances in the rapidity variable or change their amplitudes , respectively ( see section 2 ) .",
    "figure 5 : conductance @xmath306  for the complex free fermion with the energy operator defects as a function of the inverse temperature @xmath307 for fixed effective coupling constant @xmath280  and varying temperature ratios in the two halves of the wire .",
    "therefore the last option left is to change the @xmath304s , which is possible by varying the temperature .",
    "choosing now a configuration as in figure 3 with different temperatures @xmath171 and @xmath172 , one can `` create '' a second plateau at half the height of the original one .",
    "the reason for this is simply that the cooled half of the wire will cease to contribute to the conductance as can be directly deduced from ( [ gg ] ) .",
    "we depict the results of our computations in figure 5 .",
    "from this it also obvious that if we only cool the fraction @xmath308 of the wire , the lowest plateau will be positioned at the height @xmath308 times the height of the upper plateau .",
    "thus , by combining these different configurations , i.e. , different temperatures or defects , we could produce any desired plateau structure .",
    "having computed the dc  conductance by means of a tba analysis , we want to proceed now by introducing an alternative method for the acquisition of the same quantity , that is the evaluation of the celebrated kubo formula @xcite    @xmath309    the key quantity needed for the explicit computation of ( [ kubo ] ) is the occurrence of the current - current correlation function @xmath310 . in the latter , the subscripts ( @xmath8 , @xmath15 ) indicate that , in general , one is interested in a situation when both , the mass scale of the particles in the quantum field theory and the temperature , are non - vanishing .",
    "this is precisely the same regime in which we have carried out the tba analysis in the previous section and ultimately we want to compare the outcome of both computations .",
    "so far , formula ( [ kubo ] ) still refers to a situation in which no defect is present in the theory . later on we will see how the kubo formula can also be generalized in order to incorporate the presence of defects .    as a consequence of the central role played by the two - point function of the current operator in ( [ kubo ] )",
    ", we will devote an important part of this section to recall the key features of a concrete method which will allow for the computation of such a quantity that is , the form factor bootstrap approach @xcite . to carry out this program",
    "one needs essentially as the only input the scattering matrix and it is then in principle possible to compute form factors associated to various local operators of the quantum field theory under investigation .",
    "form factors are defined as matrix elements of some local operator @xmath311 located at the origin between a multiparticle in - state and the vacuum ,    @xmath312    they can be obtained by a direct computation once a representation for the operator involved is known or as solution to a certain set of physically motivated consistency equations  @xcite , in a similar fashion as one can determine exact scattering matrices or transmission and reflection amplitudes for 1 + 1 dimensional integrable systems as discussed in section 2 .    in the zero - temperature regime ,",
    "the latter fact is well - known since the original works @xcite and has lead successfully to the computation of correlation functions for many models , albeit in most cases only approximately .",
    "it is easy to show that once the corresponding form factors associated to two local operators @xmath313 and @xmath314 are known , the computation of their two - point function is reduced to the task , still non - trivial , of evaluating the following series    @xmath315 ^{\\ast } , \\label{tzero}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath316 .",
    "the previous expression is simply obtained by introducing a sum over a complete set of states in between the two operators involved in the correlation function and by shifting the operator @xmath317 to the origin thereafter . however , as indicated by the subscripts , this formula applies only to the zero temperature regime . obviously , when setting @xmath318 , the correlation function ( [ tzero ] ) is precisely the quantity entering the kubo formula ( [ kubo ] ) , although for @xmath319 .",
    "it is therefore necessary to find a generalization of the expansion ( [ tzero ] ) to the @xmath320-regime .",
    "such type of generalization was first suggested in @xcite for the ising model .",
    "it appears , however , to be difficult to generalize this to dynamically interacting models @xcite and since by now this has not been achieved we shall concentrate on the zero temperature regime in this paper .      with the help of ( [ tzero ] ) we could in principle",
    "compute the current - current correlation function and therefore evaluate the kubo formula when there are no boundaries or defects present . with regard to the inclusion of boundaries ,",
    "the first examples in which the kubo formula was generalized in order to accommodate that situation were provided in @xcite . in there",
    "the expression ( [ kubo ] ) was evaluated for the sinh - gordon and sine - gordon model in the @xmath321 @xmath322 _ _  _ _ limit and in the presence of a boundary .",
    "this was done by replacing the vacuum state @xmath323 with a boundary state @xmath324 in the current - current correlation function as follows @xmath325 the boundary state @xmath326b@xmath327 is understood as the action of a boundary operator b on the vacuum state @xmath327 @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , one exchanges usually the roles of space and time , such that the correlation functions are radially rather than time ordered .",
    "this is the reason why the boundary operator b can only enter at the very right or left , since one formulates such theories in half space .",
    "in contrast to the boundary , a defect can also enter in - between the operators .",
    "therefore , in order to include a defect in ( [ kubo ] ) , one has to consider terms of the form @xmath328 where @xmath13 represents the defect operator .    as a consequence of ( [ dd ] )",
    ", the evaluation of the defect kubo formula will require the computation of matrix elements involving the operators @xmath13 @xmath329 equation ( [ kubod ] ) expresses the conductance for a situation in which @xmath58 generic defects @xmath330 are present in the theory and located at positions @xmath331 in space .",
    "the defect degrees of freedom are encoded into the vector @xmath60 , as done in previous sections . in order to compare with the tba results we would like , of course , to compute the conductance in the massive , finite temperature regime . as mentioned",
    "the evaluation of temperature dependent correlation functions is still poorly understood , even for the simplest models .",
    "in addition , the presence of the limit in the parameter @xmath16 , together with the introduction of the defect operator @xmath332 in the current - current two - point function makes the generic evaluation of ( [ kubod ] ) fairly involved and constitutes a problem which in general can not be solved analytically .",
    "this is specially cumbersome when double defects are considered , since the expressions for the reflection and transmission amplitudes ( [ tr ] ) , ( [ tr2 ] ) are , in general , quite messy to handle . for these reasons",
    "it is interesting to start with a more simplified situation , in which some analytical calculations can still be performed , that is the @xmath319 regime .",
    "one may now view ( [ dd ] ) as a three - point function and extend the expansion ( [ tzero ] ) to the case when three operators enter the correlation function .",
    "this will only require the inclusion of one more set of complete states , such that ( [ dd ] ) is expanded in terms of the form factors of the three operators involved @xmath333 we will now restrict ourselves further and consider the massless version of ( [ tree ] ) . in this limit , the results obtained for the conductance should agree with the uv - limit of the conductance computed by means of ( [ i11 ] ) , ( [ gg ] ) .",
    "such a limit can be carried out by exploiting the massless prescription suggested originally in @xcite and already introduced in the paragraph before equation ( [ lr0 ] ) .",
    "for the form factors in ( [ tree ] ) the massless limit yields @xmath334 with @xmath335 and @xmath336 for @xmath337 and @xmath338 for @xmath339 .",
    "namely , in the massless limit every massive @xmath58-particle form factor is mapped into @xmath340 massless form factors . using these expressions , performing a wick rotation and introducing the variable @xmath341",
    ", we obtain from ( [ tree ] ) @xmath342 we note that for the massless prescription to work , the matrix element involving the defect @xmath13 can only depend on the rapidity differences , which will indeed be the case as we see below . performing the variable transformation @xmath343 , we re - write the r.h.s . of ( [ tree2 ] )",
    "as @xmath344 we substitute now this correlation function into the kubo formula , shift all rapidities as @xmath345 @xmath346 , @xmath347 @xmath346 use the lorentz invariance of the form factors the lorentz spin of the operator @xmath313 and @xmath348 being a constant , the form factors satisfy @xmath349 ] and carry out the integration in @xmath350@xmath351 we state various observations : since the matrix element involving the defect only depends on the rapidity difference , it is not affected by the shifts .",
    "the lorentz spin @xmath352 plays a very special role in ( [ conn ] ) , which makes the current operator especially distinguished . in that case the r.h.s . of ( [ conn ] ) becomes independent of the frequency @xmath16 and the limit is carried out trivially .",
    "furthermore , since the final expression has to be independent of @xmath353 , we deduce that the form factors have to be linearly dependent on @xmath353 .",
    "one may now compute the form factors by solving either the associated consistency equations or by using concrete realizations of the operators .",
    "for those form factors involving the current operator @xmath14 , a realization in terms of the zf - algebra was given in @xcite for complex free fermion type models and used to compute the corresponding matrix elements .",
    "we will determine form factors involving the defect operator in the same fashion , which means we require a concrete realization for the operator @xmath18 .",
    "a realization of @xmath18 can be achieved very much in analogy to a realization of local operators , i.e. as exponentials of bilinears in the zf - operators @xcite .",
    "for the case of a boundary a generic model independent realization for the boundary operator b was originally proposed in @xcite for the parity invariant case , i.e. , @xmath354 .",
    "this proposal was generalized to the defect operator in @xcite with the same restriction and for self - conjugated particles .",
    "this realization was used by the authors for the computation of various matrix elements involving the defect operator . our aim in this section is to extend this realization in order to incorporate the possibility of parity breaking as well as non self - conjugated particles . a non - trivial consistency check for the validity of our proposal",
    "will be ultimately provided when exploiting it in the computation of the conductance , obtained before by entirely different means , that is the tba approach .",
    "the realization we want to propose here is a direct generalization of the one presented in @xcite , namely @xmath355:\\text { } ,   \\label{d}\\ ] ] where  :  : denotes normal ordering and the operator @xmath356 has the form @xmath357 ,   \\label{gend}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath358 in comparison with @xcite we have used a slightly different normalization factor , since in general we have contributions in the sum over @xmath1 in ( [ gend ] ) including both particles and anti - particles , as for the complex free fermion we shall treat below . following the arguments given in @xcite , the operator @xmath359 depends on the amplitudes @xmath360 , @xmath361 , @xmath362 and @xmath363 with their arguments shifted according to ( [ s1])-([s2 ] ) , as considered also in @xcite .",
    "the reason for these shifts is the exchange of the roles played by the space and time coordinates @xmath364 , which was already mentioned after ( [ bb ] ) . doing this and keeping",
    "simultaneously the product @xmath365 invariant requires the rapidity shifts in ( [ s1])-([s2 ] ) . in our context",
    ", this implies that we must now not only perform the shifts ( [ s1])-([s2 ] ) in our expressions , but also , with regard to the positions of the defects , the change @xmath366 should be implemented",
    ". the latter replacement will play an important role since , similar as in the tba case , the amplitudes ( [ s1])-([s2 ] ) will become in this way strongly oscillating functions of @xmath367 .",
    "therefore , we may be able to carry out once more certain analytical calculations , by replacing the mentioned functions with their mean values . in ( [ gend ] )",
    "we have already specialized to the case when the reflection and transmission amplitudes are diagonal both with respect to the particle and defect degrees of freedom , since that will be the situation for all the examples we want to treat in this paper .",
    "having now a concrete generic realization of the defect ( [ gend ] ) , we can compute the defect matrix elements .",
    "one way of doing this is to solve a set of consistency equations which relate the lower particle matrix elements to higher particle ones , similar as in the standard form factor program @xcite .",
    "such kind of iterative equations were proposed in @xcite for a parity invariant defect and for a real free fermionic and bosonic theory .",
    "first we note that the operator ( [ d ] ) becomes @xmath368:,\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath369 and @xmath182 .",
    "the defect should act in this case as the identity operator and , according to ( [ z1/2 ] ) , @xmath370 holds , simply by employing wick s theorem when carrying out the necessary contractions . for two particles",
    "we find , @xmath371 where we recall from section 2 the notation@xmath372 and @xmath373 .",
    "for later convenience we have introduced the functions @xmath374 since the @xmath375 , @xmath376,@xmath377and @xmath378 amplitudes defined by ( [ s1])-([s2 ] ) will repeatedly appear in the combinations ( [ uss1 ] ) , ( [ uss2 ] ) in what follows .",
    "the latter equalities in ( [ uss1 ] ) , ( [ uss2 ] ) follow simply from @xmath379 which are in turn consequences of the crossing - hermiticity properties ( [ c1])-([c2 ] ) . having these matrix elements we can construct the ones involving more particles recursively from @xmath380 @xmath381 here we denoted with the check on the rapidities @xmath382 the absence of the corresponding particle in the matrix element .",
    "it is clear from the expressions ( [ d ] ) and ( [ gend ] ) that the only possible non - vanishing matrix elements ( [ mm ] ) are those when @xmath383 is even .",
    "taking ( [ i1])-([i3 ] ) as the initial conditions for the recursive equation ( [ mm])-([mm2 ] ) , we can now either solve them iteratively or use ( [ d ] ) and evaluate the matrix elements directly .",
    "similar as for the tba we want to exemplify our general formulae with the complex free fermion .",
    "we consider now the particularization of the defect realization ( [ gend ] ) to this case .",
    "then the generators of the zf - algebra _ _ z__@xmath384 _ _ z__@xmath385 are just the usual creation and annihilation operators @xmath386 in the free fermionic fock space and we have to distinguish between particles _",
    "i _ and antiparticles _ _. for the complex free fermion it is interesting to notice that the realization ( [ d ] ) resembles very much the one employed in @xcite for a prototype local field .",
    "let us now use ( [ d])-([gend ] ) in order to evaluate matrix elements involving the defect operator .",
    "in what follows , the most relevant matrix elements are those involving four particles , for which we compute @xmath387 \\delta _ { i\\bar{k } } ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\langle a_{i}(\\theta _ { 1})z_{\\mathbf{\\alpha } } a_{i}^{\\dagger } ( \\theta _ { 2})a_{k}^{\\dagger } ( \\theta _ { 3})a_{i}^{\\dagger } ( \\theta _ { 4})\\rangle = \\pi ^{2}\\hat{w}_{i}^{\\mathbf{\\alpha } } ( \\theta _ { 1})\\hat{k}_{i}^{\\mathbf{\\alpha } } ( -\\theta _ { 3})^{\\ast } \\left [ \\delta ( \\hat{\\theta}_{23})\\delta ( \\theta _ { 14})-\\delta ( \\theta _ { 12})\\delta ( \\hat{\\theta}_{34})\\right ] \\delta _ { i\\bar{k } } ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the abbreviations @xmath388 one can also find solutions for all @xmath58-particle form factors either from ( [ mm])-([mm2 ] ) or by direct computation .",

    "the other cases work the same way .",
    "starting with the expansion of the determinant @xmath395 with respect to the row involving the variable @xmath396 gives @xmath397 inserting then ( [ bob ] ) into ( [ allis ] ) , we obtain @xmath398 expanding now the second determinant in ( [ koelln ] ) with respect to the @xmath399-th row , which involves the rapidity @xmath396 , and using the fact that the @xmath400s are just integration variables and therefore , the sum in @xmath401 gives actually @xmath58 times the same contribution ,",

    "we present them at this stage and will confirm their validity below by some specific examples . specializing to the case in which all @xmath78 defects are of the same type and equidistantly separated , i.e. , @xmath426 . as in the tba context ( [ massl ] ) , we can identify two distinct regions @xmath427 where we used in addition ( [ uss2 ] ) . supported by our explicit examples below , we find that for @xmath428 in ( [ reg ] ) the amplitudes @xmath418 become independent functions of the rapidity .",
    "as we have already argued above @xmath429 the two regions specified in ( [ reg ] ) are in complete agreement with the regions identified in equation ( [ massl ] ) , since we also consider here the massless limit . when exploiting ( [ reg ] ) , our explicit examples below yield the values of the conductance as those computed from ( [ massl ] ) . in the regime",
    "@xmath428 this is very apparent , since when @xmath430 it becomes equal to @xmath431 and the conductance reduces just to the constant factor given by ( [ reg ] ) times the value @xmath432 obtained when defects are not present in the theory .",
    "the vanishing of the first contribution in ( [ corr ] ) is also quite suggestive with regard to the tba results , since the conductance obtained in terms of thermodynamic quantities only involves the moduli of the transmission or the reflection amplitudes , but not both simultaneously and , in the light of the previous discussion , that seems to extend also to the form factor computation .",
    "the coincidence in the regime for finite value of @xmath67 between the kubo formula based on ( [ reg ] ) and the results from the landauer formula are less obvious and we support this by some explicit computations for several specific defects , similar as in subsection 3.5 .      a simple example to start with , which at the same time provides a first test of the working of the kubo formula in the uv - limit is a transparent defect , i.e. , purely transmitting .",
    "as shown in subsection 2.3.3 , examples for this are the absence of a defect @xmath434 as well as the defect @xmath136 , for which the associated reflection and transmission amplitudes are given by ( [ rb ] ) and ( [ tb ] ) . in this case",
    "the observation @xmath435 is of course trivial and therefore only the second integral in ( [ corr ] ) is relevant .",
    "the situation in which there is no defect was already commented on in the paragraph after equation ( [ :-> ] ) .",
    "we found in that case that the kubo formula leads to entirely consistent results with regard to our tba analysis , that is @xmath413 in the massless limit .",
    "considering now a theory with @xmath58 defects of the type @xmath436 , we find @xmath437 simply by exploiting the expressions ( [ tb ] ) for a single defect and the formulae ( [ ttr ] ) and ( [ ttr2 ] ) . from ( [ transp ] ) it follows that @xmath438 just , as in the case in which the defect is absent .",
    "therefore , we recover once more the value @xmath439 for the conductance at zero mass and temperature .    the next complication arises for defects whose reflection and transmission amplitudes are simultaneously non - vanishing , but at the same time are independent functions of the rapidity . as we have seen in section 3.5",
    ", those defects can be very easily handled in the context of a tba calculation for the conductance , since the modulus of the transmission amplitudes is a constant , depending only on the defect coupling @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , the conductance is simply given by the constant @xmath440 times the value ( [ nodef ] ) .",
    "the vanishing of the function @xmath422 can be established in those cases by exploiting the crossing properties listened above .",
    "namely , from ( [ c1])-([c2 ] ) we find @xmath441 whenever the reflection amplitudes are independent of the rapidity , and therefore @xmath442 .",
    "the latter quantity is zero for the defects @xmath443 and @xmath444 treated in section 2.3.4 , when setting @xmath445 , since the reflection amplitudes are purely complex quantities .",
    "therefore , the kubo formula computation leads to the same results as found in subsection 3.6.1 , since we find @xmath446 which yields @xmath447 as expected , for @xmath448 we recover once more the value ( [ nodef ] ) .",
    "let us now treat the energy operator defect , the example which has been most extensively studied in our previous sections .",
    "considering first a theory possessing a single defect of this type , we find @xmath450 therefore , in this case the amplitude @xmath451 is non - vanishing . however , we find that @xmath423 .",
    "this means that the integral of this function ( or its complex conjugated ) is vanishing .",
    "consequently , only the transmission part contributes non - trivially to ( [ corr ] ) . in order to evaluate ( [ 4p ] ) in the massless limit ,",
    "we are interested in this limit of ( [ ggg ] ) which enters equation ( [ corr ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath452 which , together with ( [ mf1 ] ) leads to the result @xmath453 again in agreement with the corresponding result ( [ g1 ] ) from the landauer formula .",
    "let us now proceed to the study of the conductance in the presence of a double defect .",
    "again , we consider first the case @xmath404 and two defects of the energy operator type located at the origin and at a distance @xmath67 from the origin , respectively .",
    "expression ( [ jzj ] ) again holds for that situation with @xmath454 .",
    "as explained in the paragraph after equation ( [ tr2 ] ) , the greek indices in the defect operator encode also the space dependence .",
    "the reflection and transmission amplitudes are computed according to ( [ tr ] ) and ( [ tr2 ] ) with ( [ ggg ] ) .",
    "these functions can thereafter be substituted into equation ( [ 4p ] ) in order to determine the explicit form of the functions @xmath455 and @xmath456 in ( [ 4p ] ) for the double defect system , which depend now on the distance @xmath67 between the defects and their expressions become very cumbersome .",
    "once more , it is possible to show that the contribution to the conductance depending on @xmath456 is vanishing and therefore only the function @xmath457 will be of further interest to us .",
