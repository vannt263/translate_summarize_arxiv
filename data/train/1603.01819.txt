    "diffusion - based molecular communication is one of the promising mechanisms for communication among nano - scale machines . in such systems ,",
    "molecules are used as information carriers instead of the electromagnetic waves .",
    "information may be encoded in the number , type or release time of the molecules . released",
    "molecules gradually diffuse in the medium , resulting in channel memory and inter - symbol interference ( isi ) .",
    "one of the main theoretical challenges of molecular communication is handling of the channel memory .    while isi is a common issue in classical communications ,",
    "it is more challenging and prominent in the context of molecular communication because one can not readily combat isi with classical channel equalization techniques .",
    "this is due to the fact that molecular communication systems are _ positive systems _ , i.e. , transmitter can only release a positive amount of concentration of a specific molecule into the medium . as a result ,",
    "consecutive transmissions at the transmitter side can only contribute positively to the molecules at the receiver side , and can not cancel out the previous transmissions .",
    "one approach to handle _ negative _ signals is to add a constant value ( dc term ) to both negative and positive transmission concentrations to make all the transmitted concentrations positive .",
    "for instance , to transmit amplitudes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we can consider a dc term of @xmath1 , i.e. , making transmitted concentrations as @xmath2 and @xmath3 for negative and positive messages , respectively .",
    "however , this will increase the number of transmitted molecules ( transmission power ) and may not be appropriate . in @xcite ,",
    "negative signals are handled by assuming that the input signal is the derivative of molecule concentration .",
    "the derivative of a positive signal can be both positive and negative .",
    "thus , when we want to send positive signals , it is suggested to increase the current level of diffusion and if we want to send negative signals , we reduce the current level of transmission . however , the fact that the input signal has to be the derivative of some non - negative waveform does impose restrictions on the input signal .",
    "how this constraint translates into the fourier domain is a challenge in employing the model of @xcite .",
    "to simulate negative signals , another known promising idea exploits a unique feature of molecular communication , namely chemical reactions .",
    "the general idea is that when molecules of different type bond together , they produce new molecule types and reduce the concentration of original molecule types . in @xcite ,",
    "the release of enzymes throughout the environment to put down the remaining molecular concentration from previous transmissions is proposed .",
    "however , this would also weaken the direct link between the transmitter and the receiver and would imply higher transmission powers .",
    "chemical reactions are also employed in design of molecular logic gates like xor , with two types of molecules that nullify each other @xcite .",
    "two works that consider chemical reactions to simulate negative signals are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "authors in @xcite propose that one puts information on molecules of type @xmath4 , but also follow it by the release molecules of type @xmath5 ( called a poison signal ) to chemically cancel effect of remaining isi terms ; thus , molecules of type @xmath5 are playing the role of negative signals . in @xcite , the idea of using @xmath6 and @xmath7 ions",
    "is proposed wherein transmitting each of these ions reduces the concentration of the other one in the medium",
    ". therefore these ions can play roles of positive and negative signals .",
    "diffusion - reaction equations are used to describe the variation of the concentration of ions in the medium .",
    "the main challenge of this system is that these diffusion - reaction equations are _ nonlinear _ , making its analysis a challenging problem .",
    "a different suggestion is given in @xcite to use two molecule types of @xmath4 and @xmath5 as primary and secondary signals to mitigate isi .",
    "information is transmitted on the primary signal , via molecules of type @xmath4 .",
    "the number of molecules of type @xmath4 at each time slot are either due to the current transmission , or previous transmissions ( isi term ) .",
    "to convey the isi term to the receiver , the idea is that after each transmission of primary molecules of type @xmath4 , with a certain delay , a proportional amount of molecules @xmath5 is emitted to the medium .",
    "no reaction occurs between molecules of type @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and molecules of type @xmath5 experience a similar channel as molecules of type @xmath4 . observing that molecules of type @xmath5 are released after a delay , the idea is to treat the number of arriving molecules of type @xmath5 as the isi term of molecules of type @xmath4 that we wish to cancel .",
    "then , the receiver subtracts the number of received molecules of type @xmath4 and @xmath5 to suppress the isi .",
    "a numerical optimization is run to find the best choice of delay and the amount of released molecules of type @xmath5 to minimize the error probability .",
    "while this approach is shown to reduce the isi , its performance is obtained numerically .    to sum this up",
    ", previous works consider four solutions : ( 1 ) adding a dc to make the signal positive , ( 2 ) coding information on the signal derivative , ( 3 ) using chemical reactions , and ( 4 ) using pre - equalization ( with primary and secondary signals ) .",
    "our goal is to find a solution to simulate the effect of negative signals such that the resulting system still _ remains linear_. the property of linearity will allow us to apply classical communication approaches , such as spectral transformations , for communication and detection paradigms in the general multiple transmitter and multiple receivers setting . in particular , this scheme will permit us to use a _ precoder _ filter to compensate the adverse effects of the channel .",
    "we propose to exploit the fact that any arbitrary real signal is the _ difference _ of two positive signals .",
    "the idea is to use two different types of molecules ( denoted by molecules @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) for positive and negative transmissions . in other words , when we would like to send a positive signal , we release molecules of type @xmath4 , and for sending a negative signal , we release molecules of type @xmath5 .",
    "that is , if the transmitter wants to transmit signal @xmath8 , if @xmath9 then @xmath8 moles of molecules of type @xmath4 will be released , and if @xmath10 , then @xmath11 moles of molecules of type @xmath5 will be inserted into the medium .",
    "[ fig.signal ] demonstrates this scheme for transmitting @xmath12 into the medium . in this transmission strategy , the difference of the concentration of molecules of types @xmath4 and @xmath5 is equal to the signal @xmath13 .",
    "we call this signaling the type based sign ( ts ) modulation .",
    "our solution has similarities and differences with each of the previous solutions .",
    "while our solution is not based on chemical reactions as in @xcite , crucially we see that the resulting system remains linear ; in fact , chemical reactions can be utilized for an improved performance .",
    "next , our idea is similar to the one given in @xcite in the sense that we look at the _ difference _ of concentrations of molecules of type @xmath4 and @xmath5 to identify the signal .",
    "but our approach differs from the ones given in @xcite as we use molecules @xmath4 and @xmath5 in a _ symmetric way _ for positive and negative amplitudes , whereas in @xcite molecules of type @xmath4 are the primary and carriers of information , while molecules of type @xmath5 follow molecules of type @xmath4 by mirroring them appropriately in order to reduce the channel isi .",
    "thus , molecules of type @xmath5 are treated as secondary or poison signals . on the other hand",
    ", our approach for canceling the isi term is via a _ precoder _ for an effective channel derived using the diffusion - reaction equations .",
    "furthermore , the conceptual reason for taking the difference of concentrations of molecules of type @xmath4 and @xmath5 is not because we view one as a poison for the other , but because the difference of concentrations follows a linear differential equation that is not affected by the reaction rate between molecules .",
    "furthermore , there is a unique feature in our approach . to explain this ,",
    "let us consider an open unbounded medium with no drift and no reaction .",
    "then , if we release one molar of molecules at the origin at time zero , the concentration of molecules equals @xmath14}{(4 \\pi d t)^{1.5 } } { \\mathsf{exp}}(-\\frac{\\|r\\| _ 2 ^2 } { 4dt}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the concentration at time @xmath16 at location @xmath17 . for large values of @xmath16 , @xmath15 vanishes like a constant times @xmath18 , as @xmath19 this inverse polynomial decay is slow and leads to large values of isi . ; for instance , see @xcite for a bounded region with a reflexive boundary condition . however , one should note that the value of @xmath20 is proportional to the diameter of the region ( it depends on the poincar constant of the medium , which is proportional to its diameter @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", the decay can be still very slow and lead to large values of isi .",
    "] on the other hand , we get much faster decays if we allow for chemical reactions . for a broad class of chemical - reaction equations , it is shown in @xcite ( using the entropy method ) that the concentration of molecules converges exponentially fast in time to its stationary distribution like @xmath21 . to sum this up , chemical reactions allow for fast exponential decays .",
    "this is helpful for combatting the isi , as the effect of previous transmissions dies out faster .",
    "but chemical reactions not only decrease the isi terms , but also the direct link .",
    "in fact , the approach of @xcite based on the release of enzymes has this drawback .",
    "however , the unique feature of our approach is that it allows us to overcome this difficulty because the differential equation that governs the difference of molecules of type @xmath4 and @xmath5 is not affected by any of chemical reaction rates .",
    "thus , in an intuitive sense , chemical reactions are utilized in a dimension perpendicular to the direction of the signal propagation .",
    "our contribution can be summarized as follows : ( i ) we propose a new type based sign ( ts ) signaling strategy to introduce negative signals for molecular communication ( ii ) the ts signaling is utilized for precoder design .",
    "the effect of various imperfections on the error probability of the precoder are studied ; supporting analytical results and numerical simulations are also given .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : system - model ]",
    ", fick s law of diffusion as well as reaction - diffusion equations are reviewed .",
    "section [ sec : tsmodul ] gives the principles of the ts modulation .",
    "the scheme is applied to a time slotted communication setting in section [ sec : tssig ] . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we derive a precoder , utilizing the ts modulation . in section [ section : imperfect - reaction ] , the effect of imperfect chemical reactions on the noise variance at the receiver is studied .",
    "section [ numeric ] provides extensive numerical results to verify the various claims given in the paper , and finally section [ sec : conc ] concludes the paper .",
    "diffusion of molecules can be studied from either a microscopic or macroscopic perspectives , depending on the number of released molecules .",
    "if the number of released molecules is small , the microscopic perspective is relevant and the movement of individual molecules should be studied through brownian motion and stochastic differential equations .",
    "if possibility of chemical reaction between molecules of different types is considered , one will have brownian motion with interacting particles . on the other hand ,",
    "if the number of released molecules is large , the macroscopic perspective is relevant and the variation of the concentration of molecules should be studied through the deterministic fick s laws of diffusion .",
    "if chemical reaction between molecules also exists , one should look at reaction - diffusion differential equations ( still a deterministic equation ) .",
    "herein , we assume that the number of released molecules is large and utilize the macroscopic perspective .",
    "the macroscopic diffusion of a molecules over an medium is described as follows : assume that the medium has a time - invariant flow velocity @xmath22 at location @xmath17 .",
    "the fick s second law of diffusion states that @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the concentration of molecule at time @xmath16 and position @xmath17 , @xmath25 is the diffusion coefficients of molecules , and @xmath26 denotes the concentration of molecule production rate at point @xmath17 ( by the transmitter ) , _",
    "i.e. , _ the number of molecules added to the environment between time @xmath27 $ ] in a small volume @xmath28 around @xmath17 is equal to @xmath29",
    ". equation can be understood as follows : any change in @xmath24 is due to the following factors :    * the term @xmath30 due to _ medium inhomogeneity _ : molecules flow from area of high concentration to areas of low concentration , and the rate of this flow is proportional to the difference of concentrations .",
    "thus , the gradient of @xmath24 gives the flow due to medium inhomogeneity .",
    "but the mere existence of a flow does not necessarily imply a change in concentration of molecules at @xmath17 .",
    "for instance , in a uniform flow , the number of molecules that enter @xmath17 equals the number of molecules that exit @xmath17 .",
    "concentration of molecules at @xmath17 changes if there is a mismatch between the incoming and outgoing flows at @xmath17 , _",
    "i.e. , _ variations in the gradient of @xmath24 , which is @xmath30 .",
    "* the term @xmath31 is due to the velocity of the medium .",
    "the velocity of the medium can alter concentration of molecules at @xmath17 , but as velocity mixes molecules from a neighborhood of @xmath17 , it should be considered in conjunction with the concentration of molecules in the vicinity of @xmath17 .",
    "this is reflected in computing the divergence of the product @xmath32 . *",
    "the molecule production rate @xmath26 at @xmath17 directly contributes to a change in @xmath24 .",
    "the molecule production rate is due to the transmitter(s ) .",
    "let us denote the medium by a bounded region @xmath33 , and its boundary by @xmath34 . to ensure that has a unique solution for @xmath24 , initial , boundary conditions as well as some technical mathematical assumptions about the boundary of @xmath34 and @xmath26 will be imposed @xcite . throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume _ initial rest and zero boundary condition_. the medium is in initial rest if it is zero and remains zero until a non - zero input is applied to the medium by the transmitter(s ) , _",

    "[ fig.quantize ] it can be realized that although by increasing the quantization levels the average distortion decreases , the error rate does not decrease .",
    "for instance , the error probability for the quantization level of @xmath272 is less than the one for @xmath273 .",

    "the restriction of positive signals makes handling of isi a challenge for molecular communication . in this paper , we proposed a new modulation scheme , named ts , to simulate negative signals .",

    "implies that the modulation scheme is _ robust _ with respect to factors that influence the reaction rate such as existence of a catalyst .",

    "consider the reaction diffusion equations given in and . when @xmath289 , _ i.e. , _ when the non - linear term does not exist , the system whose inputs are @xmath290 and @xmath291 and whose outputs are @xmath61 and @xmath62 is linear . as a result multiplying both @xmath290 and @xmath291 by a constant",
    "@xmath292 would affect @xmath61 and @xmath62 by the multiplicative constant @xmath292 . to understand the case of @xmath293 , it is helpful to consider the following change of variables : @xmath294 , @xmath295 , @xmath296 , @xmath297 , @xmath298 , @xmath299 , @xmath300 , and @xmath301 in equations and for some positive @xmath292 and @xmath302 . then , after the rescaling , equations and become @xmath303 note that this is the same reaction - diffusion equation with @xmath304 .",
    "let us begin with the case of @xmath305 , @xmath306 .",
    "we observe that multiplying both @xmath290 and @xmath291 by a constant @xmath292 would affect @xmath61 and @xmath62 by the same multiplicative constant @xmath292 _ only if @xmath58 is also multiplied by @xmath292 . _",
    "when we employ @xmath307 times higher molecule production rates @xmath290 and @xmath291 , we should make the chemical reaction @xmath292 times faster if we want the concentrations @xmath61 and @xmath62 to be multiplied by @xmath292 .",
    "if we keep using the same reaction rate @xmath58 , molecules of type @xmath4 and @xmath5 would not cancel out as fast as @xmath308 and concentrations of molecules of type @xmath4 and @xmath5 will be multiplied by bigger multiplicative constants than @xmath292 .",
    "this is an effect of the non - linear term .    finally , consider the case of @xmath309 , @xmath310 .",
    "observe the particular change of variable @xmath301 used . here , we see the intuitive relation between @xmath58 and time : if we multiply @xmath58 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 by two , we are making the reaction and diffusion twice as fast and we expect the same diffusion pattern in half the time .",
    "now , consider the use a time - slotted communication strategy with time steps of size @xmath95 .",
    "the above discussion shows that decreasing @xmath95 by a factor of two while at the same time increasing @xmath58 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 by a factor of two would keep the molecular concentrations ( and the error probabilities ) the same .",
    "consider the differential equations @xmath311 let @xmath312 and @xmath313 be two solutions to the above equations , where @xmath314 and @xmath315 are assumed to be hlder continuous functions . then by adding up equation for these two solutions , we obtain @xmath316 where in , we used the fact that @xmath317 and @xmath318 are non - negative . similarly , @xmath319 furthermore , @xmath320 have the zero initial and boundary conditions .",
    "now , consider the reaction - diffusion set of equations for molecule production rates @xmath321 and @xmath322 : @xmath323 these equations can be re - expressed in the standard form @xmath324 for @xmath325 @xmath326 observe that @xmath327 and @xmath328 and @xmath329 are quasi - monotone decreasing functions ( in the sense of @xcite ) . as a result , and imply that @xmath320 is an upper solution for and in the sense of @xcite .",
