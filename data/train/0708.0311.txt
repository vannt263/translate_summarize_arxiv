    "understanding the statistical properties of a fully developed turbulent velocity field from the lagrangian point of view is a challenging theoretical and experimental problem .",
    "it is a key ingredient for the development of stochastic models for turbulent transport in such diverse contexts as combustion , pollutant dispersion , cloud formation , and industrial mixing.@xcite progress has been hindered primarily by the presence of a wide range of dynamical timescales , an inherent property of fully developed turbulence . indeed , for a complete description of particle statistics , it is necessary to follow their paths with very fine spatial and temporal resolution , on the order of the kolmogorov length and time scales @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the trajectories should be tracked for long times , order the eddy turnover time @xmath2 , requiring access to a vast experimental measurement region .",
    "the ratio of the above timescales can be estimated as @xmath3 , and the microscale reynolds number @xmath4 ranges from hundreds to thousands in typical laboratory experiments . despite these difficulties , many experimental and numerical studies of lagrangian turbulence",
    "have been reported over the years.@xcite here , we present a detailed comparison between state - of - the - art experimental and numerical studies of high reynolds number lagrangian turbulence",
    ". we focus on single particle statistics , with time lags ranging from smaller than @xmath5 to order @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , we study the lagrangian velocity structure functions ( lvsf ) , defined as @xmath6^p \\rangle\\ , , \\label{eq : dlsf}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 denotes a single velocity component .    in the past , the corresponding eulerian quantities , _",
    "i.e. _  the moments of the spatial velocity increments , have attracted significant interest in theory , experiments , and numerical studies ( for a review see ref .  ) .",
    "it is now widely accepted that spatial velocity fluctuations are intermittent in the inertial range of scales , for @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the largest scale of the flow . by intermittency we mean anomalous scaling of the moments of the velocity increments , corresponding to a lack of self - similarity of their probability density functions ( pdfs ) at different scales . in an attempt to explain eulerian intermittency ,",
    "many phenomenological theories have been proposed , either based on stochastic cascade models ( _ e.g. _  multifractal descriptions  @xcite ) , or on closures of the navier - stokes equations.@xcite common to all these models is the presence of non - trivial physics at the dissipative scale , @xmath10 , introduced by the complex matching of the wild fluctuations in the inertial range and the dissipative smoothing mechanism at small scales.@xcite numerical and experimental observations show that clean scaling behavior for the eulerian structure functions is found only in a range @xmath11 ( see ref . for a collection of experimental and numerical results ) . for spatial scales",
    "@xmath12 , multiscaling properties , typical of the intermediate dissipative range , are observed due to the superposition of inertial range and dissipative physics.@xcite    similar questions can be raised in the lagrangian framework : ( i ) is there intermittency in lagrangian statistics ? ( ii ) is there a range of time lags where clean scaling properties ( _ i.e. _  power law behavior ) can be detected ?",
    "( iii ) are there signatures of the complex interplay between inertial and dissipative effects for small time lags @xmath13 ?    in this paper",
    "we shall address the above questions by comparing accurate direct numerical simulations ( dns ) and laboratory experiments .",
    "unlike eulerian turbulence , the study of which has attracted experimental , numerical and theoretical efforts since the last thirty years , lagrangian studies become available only very recently mainly due to the severe difficulty of obtaining accurate experimental and numerical data at sufficiently high reynolds numbers . consequently",
    ", the understanding of lagrangian statistics is still poor .",
    "this explains the absence of consensus on the scaling properties of the lvsf .",
    "in particular , there have been different assessments of the scaling behavior @xmath14 mainly due the desire to extract a single number , _",
    "i.e. _  the scaling exponent @xmath15 , over a range of time lags .    measurements using acoustic techniques  @xcite gave the first values of the exponents @xmath15 , measuring scaling properties in the range @xmath16 .",
    "subsequently , experiments based on cmos sensors  @xcite provided access to scaling properties for shorter time lags , @xmath17 , finding more intermittent values , though compatible with ref .  .",
    "dns data , obtained at lower reynolds number , allowed simultaneous measurements in both of these ranges.@xcite for @xmath18 , scaling exponents were found to be slightly less intermittent than those measured with the acoustic techniques , though again compatible within error bars . on the other hand ,",
    "dns data  @xcite for small time lags , @xmath19 , agree with scaling exponents measured in ref .  .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to critically compare state - of - the - art numerical and experimental data in order to analyze intermittency at both short and long time lags .",
    "this is a necessary step both to bring lagrangian turbulence up to the same scientific standards as eulerian turbulence and to resolve the conflict between experiment and simulations ( see also refs .  ) .    to illustrate some of the difficulties discussed above , in fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] we show a compilation of experimental and numerical results for the second - order lagrangian structure function at various reynolds numbers ( see later for details ) .",
    "the curves are compensated with the dimensional prediction given by the classical kolmogorov dimensional theory in the inertial range  @xcite , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation .",
    "the absence of any extended plateau and the trend with the reynolds number indicate that the inertial range , if any , has not developed yet .",
    "the same trends have been observed in other dns studies  @xcite and by analyzing the temporal behavior of signals with a given power - law fourier spectrum.@xcite    we stress that assessing the actual scaling behavior of the second ( and higher ) order lagrangian velocity structure functions is crucial for the development of stochastic models for lagrangian particle evolution .",
    "indeed , these models are based on the requirement that the second - order lvsf scales as @xmath22 . the issues of whether the predicted scaling is ever reached and ultimately how the lvsf deviate as a function of the reynolds numbers remains to be clarified .",
    ", at various reynolds numbers and for all data sets .",
    "details can be found in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "exp2 and exp4 refer to the same reynolds number ( @xmath23 ) , but with different measurement volumes ( larger in exp4 ) ; in particular exp2 and exp4 better resolve the small and large time lag ranges , respectively , and intersect for @xmath24",
    ". we indicate with a solid line the resulting data set made of data from exp2 ( for @xmath25 ) and exp4 ( for @xmath26 ) ; a good overlap among these data is observed in the range @xmath27 . for all data sets , a extended plateau is absent , indicating that the power law regime typical of the inertial range has not yet been achieved , even at the highest reynolds number , @xmath28 , in experiment.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    moreover ,",
    "an assessment of the presence of lagrangian intermittency calls for more general questions about phenomenological modeling . for instance",
    ", multifractal models derived from eulerian statistics can be easily translated to the lagrangian framework,@xcite with some degree of success.@xcite    the material is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sect : expdns ] , we describe the properties of the experimental setup and the direct numerical simulations , detailing the limitations in both sets of data .",
    "a comparison of lagrangian velocity structure functions is considered in section  [ sec : lvsfcomp ] .",
    "section  [ sec : lsess ] presents a detailed scale - by - scale discussion of the local scaling exponents , which is the central result of the paper .",
    "section  [ sec : concl ] draws conclusions and offers perspectives for the future study of lagrangian turbulence .",
    "before describing the experimental setup and the dns we shall briefly list the possible sources of uncertainties in both experimental and dns data . in general this is not an easy task .",
    "first , it is important to discern the deterministic from the statistical sources of errors .",
    "second , we must be able to assess the quantitative importance of both types of uncertainties on different observables .    _",
    "deterministic uncertainties_. for simplicity , we report in this work the data averaged over all three components of the velocity for both the experiments and the dns .",
    "since neither flows in the experiments nor the dns are perfectly isotropic , a part of the uncertainty in the reported data comes from the anisotropy . in the experiments",
    "the anisotropy reflects the generation of the flow and the geometry of the experimental apparatus .",
    "the anisotropy in dns is introduced by the finite volume and by the choice of the forcing mechanism . in general , the dns data are quite close to statistical isotropy , and anisotropy effects are appreciable primarily at large scales .",
    "this is also true for the data from the experiment , especially at the higher reynolds numbers .",
    "an important limitation of the experimental data is that the particle trajectories have finite length due both to finite measurement volumes and to the tracking algorithm , which primarily affect the data for large time lags .",
    "it needs to be stressed , however , that in the present experimental set up due to the fact that the flow is not driven by bulk forces , but by viscous and inertial forces at the blades , the observation volume would anyhow be limited by the mean velocity and the time it takes for a fluid particle to return to the driving blades . at the blades the turbulence is strongly influenced by the driving mechanism .",
    "therefore , in the experiments reported here the observation volume was selected to be sufficiently far away from the blades to minimize anisotropy . for short time",
    "lags , the greatest experimental difficulties come from the finite spatial resolution of the camera and the optics , the image acquisition rate , data filtering and post - processing , a step necessary to reduce noise . for dns ,",
    "typical sources of uncertainty at small time lags are due to the interpolation of the eulerian velocity field to obtain the particle position , the integration scheme used to calculate trajectories from the eulerian data , and the numerical precision of floating point arithmetic .",
    "the _ statistical uncertainties _ for both the experimental and dns data arise primarily from the finite number of particle trajectories and  especially for dns  from the time duration of the simulations .",
    "we note that this problem is also reflected in a residual , large - scale anisotropy induced by the non - perfect averaging of the forcing fluctuations in the few eddy turnover times simulated .",
    "the number of independent flow realizations can also contribute to the statistical convergence of the data . while it is common to obtain experimental measurements separated by many eddy turnover times ,",
    "typical dns results contain data from at most a few statistically independent realizations .",
    "we stress that , particularly for lagrangian turbulence , only an in - depth comparison of experimental and numerical data will allow the quantitative assessment of uncertainties .",
    "for instance , as we shall see below , dns data can be used to investigate some of the geometrical and statistical effects induced by the experimental apparatus and measurement technique .",
    "this enables us to quantify the importance of some of the above mentioned sources of uncertainty directly .",
    "dns data are , however , limited to smaller reynolds number than experiment ; therefore only data from experiments can help to better quantify reynolds number effects .",
    "the most comprehensive experimental data of lagrangian statistics are obtained by optically tracking passive tracer particles seeded in the fluid .",
    "images of the tracer particles are analyzed to determine their motion in the turbulent flow.@xcite due to the rapid decrease of the kolmogorov scale with reynolds number in typical laboratory flows , previous experimental measurements were often limited to small reynolds numbers.@xcite the kolmogorov time scale at @xmath29 in a laboratory water flow was so far resolved only by using four high speed silicon strip detectors originally developed for high - energy physics experiments .",
    "@xcite the one - dimensional nature of the silicon strip detector , however , restricted the three dimensional tracking to a single particle at a time , limiting severely the rate of data collection .",
    "recent advances in electronics technology now allow simultaneous three dimensional measurements of @xmath30 particles at a time , by using three cameras with two - dimensional cmos sensors .",
    "high - resolution lagrangian velocity statistics at reynolds numbers comparable to those measured using silicon strip detectors are therefore becoming available.@xcite    lagrangian statistics can also be measured acoustically .",
    "the acoustic technique measures the doppler frequency shift of ultrasound reflected from particles in the flow , which is directly proportional to their velocity.@xcite the size of the particles needed for signal strength in the acoustic measurements can be significantly larger than the kolmogorov scale of the flow .",
    "consequently , the particles do not follow the motion of fluid particles,@xcite and this makes the interpretation of the experimental data more difficult.@xcite    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the simulations , the main systematic error for small time lags comes from the interpolation of the eulerian velocity fields needed to integrate the equation for particle positions , @xmath31 of course , high - order interpolation schemes such as third - order taylor series interpolation or cubic splines partially remove this problem .",
    "cubic splines give higher interpolation accuracy , but they are more difficult to use in implementations that rely on secondary storage.@xcite it has been reported  @xcite that cubic schemes may resolve the most intense events better than linear interpolation , especially for acceleration statistics ; the effect , however , appears to be rather small especially as far as velocity is concerned .",
    "more crucial than the order of the interpolation scheme is the resolution of the eulerian grid in terms of the kolmogorov length scale . to enlarge the inertial range as much as possible , typical eulerian simulations tend to poorly resolve the smallest scale velocity fluctuations by choosing a grid spacing @xmath32 larger then the kolmogorov scale @xmath0 .",
    "since this strategy may be particularly harmful to lagrangian analysis , here it has been chosen to better resolve the smallest fluctuations by choosing @xmath33 and to use the simple and computationally less expensive linear interpolation .",
    "we stress that having well resolved dissipative physics for the eulerian field is also very important for capturing the formation of rare structures on a scale @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , as discussed in ref .",
    ", such structures , because of their filamentary geometry , may influence not only viscous but also inertial range physics .",
    "another possible source of error comes from the loss of accuracy in the integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dxdt ] ) for very small velocities due to round - off errors .",
    "this problem can be overcome by adopting higher - order schemes for temporal discretization .",
    "for extremely high reynolds numbers it may also be necessary to use double precision arithmetic , while for moderate @xmath4 , single precision , which was adopted in the present dns , is sufficient for accurate results ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .  ) .",
    "details of the dns analyzed here can be found elsewhere  @xcite ; here , we simply state that the lagrangian tracers move according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dxdt ] ) , in a cubic , triply periodic domain of side @xmath35 .",
    "dns parameters are summarized in table [ tab : dns ] .",
    "let us now compare the experimental and numerical measurements of the lagrangian velocity structure functions directly .",
    "figures  [ fig : lsf2 ] and [ fig : lsf4 ] show a direct comparison of lvsfs of order @xmath36 and @xmath37 for all data sets .",
    "the curves are plotted using the dimensional normalization , assuming that @xmath38 ( where we use @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "such a rescaling can be generalized as @xmath41 .",
    "both the @xmath42 and @xmath43 order moments show a fairly good collapse , especially in the range of intermediate time lags . however , some dependence can be observed both on @xmath4 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lsf4 ] ) and on the size of the measurement volume ( compare exp2 and exp4 ) .",
    "both effects call for a more quantitative understanding .      a common way to assess how the statistical properties change for varying time lags is to look at dimensionless quantities such as the generalized flatness @xmath44^{p}}\\ , .",

    "numerical and experimental results are very close , and clearly show that the intermittency changes considerably going from low to high @xmath45 .",
    "the difficulty in trying to characterize these changes quantitatively is that , as shown by fig .",

    ", we measured the logarithmic derivative ( also called local slope or local exponent ) of structure function of order @xmath51 , @xmath52 , with respect to a reference structure function,@xcite for which we chose the second - order @xmath53 : @xmath54 we stress the importance of taking the derivative with respect to a given moment : this is a direct way of looking at intermittency with no need of _ ad hoc _ fitting procedures and no request of power law behavior .",
    "this procedure,@xcite which goes under the name of extended self similarity  @xcite ( ess ) , is particularly important when assessing the statistical properties at reynolds numbers not too high and/or close to the viscous dissipative range .",
    "a non - intermittent behavior would corresponds to @xmath55 . in the range of @xmath45 for which the exponents @xmath56 are different from the dimensional values @xmath57 , structure functions are intermittent and correspondingly the normalized pdfs of @xmath58 change shape with @xmath45 .",
    "figures  [ fig : ess4 ] and [ fig : ess6 ] show the logarithmic local slopes of the numerical and experimental data sets for several reynolds numbers for @xmath37 and @xmath59 versus time normalized to the kolmogorov scale , @xmath60 .",
    "these are the main results of our analysis .",
    "the first observation is that for both orders @xmath37 and @xmath59 , the local slopes @xmath61 deviate strongly from their non - intermittent values @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "there is a tendency toward the differentiable non - intermittent limit @xmath64 only for very small time lags @xmath65 .    in the following",
    ", we shall discuss in detail the small and large time lag behavior .",
    "_ small time lags .",
    "_ for the structure function of order @xmath37 ( fig .  [ fig : ess4 ] ) , we observe the strongest deviation from the non - intermittent value in the range of time @xmath66 . it has previously been proposed that this deviation is associated with particle trapping in vortex filaments.@xcite this fact has been supported by dns investigations of inertial particles.@xcite the agreement between the dns and the experimental data in this range is remarkable . for @xmath59 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : ess6 ] ) , the scatter among the data is higher due to the fact that , with increasing order of the moments , inaccuracies in the data become more important .",
    "still , the agreement between dns and the experimental data is excellent .",
    "differently from the @xmath37 case , a dependence of mean quantities on the reynolds number is here detectable , though it lies within the error - bars .",
    "the experimental data set for @xmath59 , at the highest reynolds number ( @xmath67 ) , show a detectable trend in the local slope toward less intermittent values in the dip region , @xmath68",
    ". this change may potentially be the signature of vortex destabilization at high reynolds number  which would reduce the effect of vortex trapping .",
    "it is more likely , however , that at this very high reynolds number both spatial and temporal resolution of the measurement system may not have been sufficient to resolve the actual trajectories of intense events.@xcite we consider this to be an important open question for future studies .    _",
    "larger time lags .",
    "_ for @xmath69 up to @xmath2 , the experimental data obtained in small measurement volumes ( exp1,2,3 ) , are not resolving the physics , as they develop both strong oscillations and a common trend toward smaller and smaller values for the local slopes for increasing @xmath45 .",
    "this may be attributed to finite volume corrections ( see also sect .",
    "[ sec : vol ] ) . for these reasons ,",
    "the data of exp1,2,3 are not shown for these time ranges .",
    "on the other hand , the data from exp4 , obtained from a larger measurement volume , allow us to compare experiment and simulation . here",
    "the local slope of the experimental data changes slower very much akin to the simulations .",
    "this suggests that in this region high reynolds number turbulence may show a plateau , although the current data can not give a definitive answer to this question . for @xmath59 , a similar trend",
    "is detected , though with larger uncertainties .",
    "the excellent quantitative agreement between dns and the experimental data gives us high confidence into the local slope behavior as a function of time lag .    in light of these results",
    ", we can finally clarify the recent apparent discrepancy between measured scaling exponents of the lvsfs in experiments  @xcite and dns,@xcite which have lead to some controversy in the literature.@xcite in the experimental work  @xcite , scaling exponents were measured by fitting the curves in fig .",

    "it needs to be emphasized , however , that the limits induced by the finiteness of volume and of the inertial range extension in both dns and experimental data do not allow for making a definitive statement about the behavior in the region @xmath75 .",
    "we may ask instead if the relative extension of the interval where we see the large dip at @xmath76 and the possible plateau , observed for @xmath75 both in the numerical and experimental data ( see exp4 data set ) , becomes larger or smaller at increasing the reynolds number.@xcite if the dip region the one presumably affected by vortex filaments flattens , it would give the asymptotically stable scaling properties of lagrangian turbulence . if instead the apparent plateau region , at large times , increases in size while the effect of high intensity vortex remains limited to time lags around @xmath77 , the plateau region would give the asymptotic scaling properties of lagrangian turbulence .",

    "the modified dns statistics are essentially indistinguishable from the experimental results .",
    "it is now interesting to look at the lvsf measured from these finite length numerical trajectories .",
    "this shows that the method we devised is able to mimic the presence of a finite measurament volume as in experiments .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : alea ] , we show the fourth - order lvsf obtained by considering the full length trajectories and the trajectories living in a sub - volume as explained above .",
    "what clearly appears from fig .",
    "[ fig : alea ] is that the finite length of the trajectories lowers the value of the structure functions for time lags of the order of @xmath87 .",
    "indeed , the finite - length statistics give a signal that is always lower than the full averaged quantity : this effect may be due to a bias to slow , less energetic particles , which have a tendency to linger inside the volume for longer times than fast particles , introducing a systematic change in the statistics .",
    "note that this is the same trend detected when comparing exp2 and exp4 in figs .",
    "[ fig : lsf ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : aleb ] , we also show the effect of the finite measurement volume on the local slope for @xmath37 . by decreasing the observation volume",

    ". this could be the source of the small offset between the plateaux developed by the exp4 data and the dns data in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .    for the sake of clarity , we should recall that in the dns particles can travel across a cubic fully periodic volume , so during their full history they can reenter the volume several times . in principle , this may affect the results for long time delays .",

    "[ fig : aleb ] where we can notice the perfect agreement between data obtained by using periodic boundary conditions or limiting the analysis to subvolumes of size @xmath88 ( i.e. not retaining the periodicity ) and even @xmath89 .      as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : expdns ] , results at small time lags can be slightly contaminated by several effects both in dns and experiments .",
    "dns data can be biased by resolution effects due to interpolation of the eulerian velocity field at the particle position . in experiments uncorrelated",
    "experimental noise needs to be filtered to recover the trajectories.@xcite    to understand the importance of such effects quantitatively , we have modified the numerical lagrangian trajectories in the following way .",
    "first , we have introduced a random noise of the order of @xmath90 to the particle position , in order to mimic the noise present in the experimental particle detection .",
    "second , we have implemented the same gaussian filter of variable width used to smooth the experimental trajectories @xmath91 .",
    "we also tested the effect of filtering by processing experimental data with filters of different length .    in figs .  [",
    "fig : filterdns ] and [ fig : filterexp ] , we show the local scaling exponents for @xmath81 as measured from these modified dns trajectories together with the results obtained from the experiment , for several filter widths .",
    "the qualitative trend is very similar for both the dns and the experiment .",
    "the noise in particle position introduces non - monotonic behavior in the local slopes at very small time lags in the dns trajectories .",
    "this effect clearly indicates that small scale noise may strongly perturb measurements at small time lags , but will not have important consequences for the behavior on time scales larger than @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of the filter is to increase the smoothness at small time lags slightly ( notice the shift of local slopes curves toward the right for @xmath92 for increasing filter widths ) .",
    "a similar trend is observed in the experimental data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : filterexp ] ) . in this case , choosing the filter width to be in the range @xmath93\\tau_{\\eta}$ ] seems to be optimal , minimizing the dependence on the filter width and the effects on the relevant time lags .",
    "understanding filter effects may be even more important for experiments with larger particles , on the order of or comparable with the kolmogorov scale . in those cases , the particle size naturally introduces a filtering by averaging velocity fluctuations over its size , _",
    "i.e. _ , those particles are not faithfully following the fluid trajectories.@xcite",
    "a detailed comparison between state - of - the - art experimental and numerical data of lagrangian statistics in turbulent flows has been presented .",

    "[ fig:6 ] ) . whether the trend of logarithmic local slopes at large times is becoming more and more extended at larger and larger reynolds number is an issue for further research .",
    "both experiments and numerics show in the ess local slope of the fourth and sixth order lagrangian structure functions a dip region at around time lags @xmath77 and a flattening at @xmath95 . as of today",
    ", it is unclear whether the dip or the flattening region give the asymptotic scaling properties of lagrangian turbulence",
    ". the question of which region will extend as a function of reynolds number can not be resolved at present , and remains open for future research .",
    "it would also be important to probe the possible relations between eulerian and lagrangian statistics as suggested by simple phenomenological multifractal models.@xcite in these models , the translation between eulerian ( single - time ) spatial statistics and lagrangian statistics is made via the dimensional expression of the local eddy turnover time at scale @xmath96 : @xmath97 .",
