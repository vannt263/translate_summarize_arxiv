    "lattice methods are widely used in studies of quantum few- and many - body problems in nuclear , hadronic , and condensed matter systems , see _",
    "e.g. _  refs .",
    "a necessary step in such studies is the computation of scattering phase shifts and mixing angles from an underlying microscopic lattice hamiltonian .",
    "remarkably , the same problem arises in the context of experiments on optical lattices .",
    "several groups have pioneered the use of ultracold atoms in optical lattices produced by standing laser waves , to emulate the properties of condensed matter systems and quantum field theories  @xcite .",
    "the basic concept is to tune the interactions of the atoms , both with each other and with the optical lattice , to reproduce the single - particle properties and particle - particle interactions of the `` target theory '' .",
    "such studies often require a more general setup than a simple cubic lattice , for instance in the case of the hexagonal hubbard model  @xcite , which closely resembles the physics of graphene  @xcite and carbon nanotubes  @xcite . clearly , a robust and accurate method for computing scattering parameters on arbitrary lattices is needed . for the scattering of particles on a cubic lattice ,",
    "lscher s finite - volume method  @xcite uses periodic boundary conditions to infer elastic scattering phase shifts from energy eigenvalues .",
    "the method has been widely used in lattice qcd simulations with applications to different angular momenta  @xcite as well as partial - wave mixing  @xcite , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review .",
    "an important advantage of lscher s method is that periodic boundary conditions are typically already used in lattice calculations of nuclear , hadronic , ultracold atomic , and condensed matter systems .",
    "since no additional boundary constraints are needed , the method is easily applied to a wide class of systems .",
    "however , lscher s method requires that the finite - volume energy levels can be accurately determined , with errors small compared to the separation between adjacent energy levels .",
    "this is not practical in cases such as nucleus - nucleus scattering , where the separation between finite - volume energy levels is many orders of magnitude smaller than the total energy of the system .",
    "fortunately , this problem has been solved using an alternative approach called the adiabatic projection method  @xcite . there , initial cluster states are evolved using euclidean time projection and used to calculate an effective two - cluster hamiltonian ( or transfer matrix ) . in the limit of large projection time ,",
    "the spectral properties of the effective two - cluster hamiltonian coincide with those of the original underlying theory .",
    "this method has been applied to nuclei and ultracold atoms , while applications to lattice qcd simulations of relativistic hadronic systems are currently being investigated .",
    "since the adiabatic projection method reduces all scattering systems to an effective two - cluster lattice hamiltonian , additional boundary conditions can be applied to the effective lattice hamiltonian in order to compute scattering properties .",
    "this opens the door to methods more accurate than lscher s by removing the effects of the periodic boundary conditions , which are otherwise a significant source of rotational symmetry breaking .",
    "one promising approach is to place the particles in a harmonic oscillator potential and extract phase shifts from the energy eigenvalues  @xcite .",
    "another prominent example is the method used in refs .",
    "@xcite , whereby a `` spherical wall '' is imposed on the relative separation between the two scattering particles .",
    "phase shifts are then determined using the constraint that the wave function vanish at the wall boundary .",
    "this method has been applied to the two - nucleon problem in lattice effective field theory ( eft )  @xcite and to lattice simulations of nucleus - nucleus scattering using the adiabatic projection method  @xcite . in spite of such progress in lattice scattering theory",
    ", all methods are still lacking in precision , especially when partial - wave mixing and high angular momenta are concerned . in previous work ,",
    "numerical approximations were used for the study of coupled - channel systems  @xcite .",
    "we now describe an extension of the spherical wall method , which enables an efficient and precise determination of two - particle scattering parameters for arbitrary energies and angular momenta .",
    "we use angular momentum projection and solve the lattice radial equation with spherical wall boundaries , supplemented by an `` auxiliary potential '' .",
    "we test our method on a lattice model with strong tensor interactions that induce appreciable partial - wave mixing .",
    "we expect our method to be applicable in theoretical lattice studies of nuclear , hadronic , ultracold atomic , and condensed matter systems , as well as in the experimental design of optical lattices .",
    "while we discuss only non - relativistic wave mechanics in our examples here , the extension to relativistic systems simply entails replacing the non - relativistic dispersion relation with the relativistic one .",
