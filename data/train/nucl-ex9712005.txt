    "recently , the study of the @xmath7shell nuclei has gained renewed interest .",
    "the development of very efficient detector arrays both for @xmath3rays and charged particles has allowed investigation of the structure of these nuclei at high spins .",
    "close to the middle of the @xmath7 shell , nuclei show strong collective behaviour near the ground state  @xcite . at higher spins , shape transitions towards triaxial and non - collective deformations can occur due to an intimate interplay between the collective and microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "recently , band terminating states , corresponding to fully aligned @xmath7 configurations , were observed in @xmath8cr  @xcite and @xmath9cr  @xcite . when approaching the doubly magic nucleus @xmath10ni the collective behaviour is rapidly disappearing as nuclei evolve towards a spherical shape .",
    "so far , the nucleus @xmath0fe has been an experimental challenge .",
    "most of the known excited states in this nucleus are of relatively low spin ( below 6@xmath1 ) and have been observed in ( @xmath11he , n )  @xcite , ( @xmath12,2n )  @xcite and ( p , t )  @xcite reactions ( see also ref .",
    "attempts to extend its yrast structure to higher spins in fusion - evaporation reactions induced by heavy ions have failed so far ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the reason of this has been attributed to the probable inversion between the lowest 10@xmath4 and 12@xmath4 states , which results in an isomeric 12@xmath4 yrast trap that decays by @xmath13 emission to @xmath0mn  @xcite .",
    "thus , although fusion - evaporation reactions populate appreciably the @xmath0fe channel , the deexcitation @xmath3ray flux effectively stops at the 12@xmath4 level where it is diverted into the population of high spin states in @xmath0mn . due to the weak direct population of the lower spin states",
    ", it was not possible to observe the yrast line above the 4@xmath14 state  @xcite .",
    "one should note , however , that these previous experiments were performed with small ( 10 - 15@xmath15 efficiency ) ge(li ) detectors , and therefore had a rather low @xmath3ray detection efficiency .",
    "in this work , performed with a powerful @xmath3ray detector array , we have been able to extend the level scheme of @xmath0fe up to the 10@xmath4 state , thereby confirming the predicted inversion of the 10@xmath4 and 12@xmath4 states .",
    "the experimental data have been interpreted in the framework of spherical shell model ( sm ) calculations in the full _ pf _ shell .",
    "high spin states in the nucleus @xmath0fe have been populated via the @xmath2si + @xmath2si reaction at 115 mev beam energy .",
    "the silicon beam was delivered by the xtu tandem accelerator at the national laboratory of legnaro .",
    "the target was a 0.8 mg/@xmath16 @xmath2si foil evaporated on a 13 mg/@xmath16 au backing .",
    "gamma rays have been detected with the gasp array  @xcite which consists of 40 compton - suppressed large volume hp ge detectors and the 80 bgo crystals inner ball . the 40 ge detectors are placed symmetrically relative to the beam axis on seven rings as follows : 6 detectors at 35@xmath17 , 6 detectors at 60@xmath17 , 4 detectors at 72@xmath17 , 8 detectors at 90@xmath17 , 4 detectors at 108@xmath17 , 6 detectors at 120@xmath17 and 6 detectors at 145@xmath17 .",
    "data have been recorded when at least two ge detectors and two elements of the bgo inner ball fired in coincidence .",
    "we collected on tape a total of 7.8 x 10@xmath18 two fold and 5.4 x 10@xmath19 three fold events .",
    "gain matching and efficiency calibration of the ge detectors have been performed using @xmath20eu and @xmath10co radioactive sources .",
    "the total cross section of the reaction used was fragmented in a large number of reaction channels . in order to estimate the relative yield of these channels we have used a total @xmath3@xmath3 coincidence matrix in which we determined the intensities of the @xmath3ray transitions feeding the ground states .",
    "the most intense channels populated in our reaction were @xmath9cr ( @xmath21 ) with @xmath2231% , @xmath23cr ( @xmath24 ) with @xmath2229% and @xmath23v ( @xmath25 ) with @xmath2211% of the total cross section .",
    "states in @xmath0fe have been populated either by @xmath26 or @xmath12 evaporation .",
    "the population of the ground state of @xmath0fe was estimated to represent less than 1% of the total gamma yield .",
    "previous studies of @xmath0fe  @xcite have established the position of the yrast 2@xmath4 , 4@xmath4 , 3@xmath27 and 5@xmath27 states , of a second 4@xmath4 state and of the long lived 12@xmath4 state .",
    "this isomeric level , placed at an excitation energy of 6820@xmath28130 kev and with a measured half - life of 45.94@xmath281.0 sec  @xcite , decays @xmath5 towards states in @xmath0mn .",
    "an upper limit of 0.4 % was established  @xcite for the @xmath3decay of the 12@xmath4 state .",
    "the high efficiency of the gasp array and the use of a reaction in which low - lying levels are considerably populated by side feeding allowed us to identify new @xmath3ray transitions belonging to @xmath0fe by setting gates on the previously known @xmath3rays .",
    "double gated @xmath3coincidence spectra with gates set on some key transitions assigned to @xmath0fe are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "on the basis of such @xmath3@xmath3 coincidence data obtained from a @xmath3@xmath3@xmath3 coincidence cube and of the relative intensities of the transitions , we have constructed the level scheme shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the relative intensities of the transitions have been extracted from the 90@xmath17 spectrum in coincidence with the 850 kev 2@xmath4@xmath290@xmath4 transition in order to avoid the uncertainties introduced by the lineshape broadening .",
    "the intensity for the 2753 kev transition which is assumed to be of @xmath30i=1 character ( see level scheme ) is already corrected for the angular distribution as specified in ref .",
    "the high energy part of the spectrum at 90@xmath17 in coincidence with the 850 kev transition , from which the relative intensities were extracted , is shown in fig .",
    "we could confirm the yrast 6@xmath4 state suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite ; furthermore we established a new 6@xmath4 state as well as two 8@xmath4 states and a 10@xmath4 state lying at 7.381 mev , well above the 12@xmath4 @xmath5 decaying isomer .",
    "this constitutes the first experimental evidence for the predicted  @xcite inversion between the first 10@xmath4 and 12@xmath4 states .",
    "three new @xmath3rays connecting the 5@xmath27 level to the 3@xmath27 , 4@xmath14 and 4@xmath31 states have been identified .",
    "we have to mention here that high spin states in @xmath0fe have been also identified in a parallel experiment performed recently at gammasphere  @xcite .",
    "the low statistics together with the high background produced by the more strongly populated nuclei in this reaction , prevented the observation of a possible e4 @xmath3ray connecting the 12@xmath4 and the 8@xmath4 states .    spins and parities have been assigned on the basis of the angular distribution of the @xmath3rays .",
    "data were sorted in two @xmath3@xmath3 coincidence matrices having on one axis @xmath3rays detected at all angles and on the second axis those detected at 60@xmath17 and 120@xmath17 and those detected at 90@xmath17 , respectively . by setting gates on the axis with all the detectors , the intensity of the observed @xmath3rays follows the regular angular distribution law disregarding the multipole character of the gating transition .",
    "the ado ( angular distribution from oriented states ) ratio is defined as @xcite : @xmath32    where @xmath33 denotes the intensity of the observed @xmath3ray at the angles @xmath34 , @xmath35 and 90@xmath17 , respectively , corrected by the detection efficiency .",
    "typical values of the ado ratios for @xmath34=60@xmath17 in the gasp geometry are @xmath22 1.17 for a stretched quadrupole transition and @xmath22 0.85 for a stretched dipole transition .",
    "the @xmath3ray energies and relative intensities of the transitions belonging to @xmath0fe , together with their ado ratios at 60@xmath17 and spin  parity assignments are reported in table [ table1 ] .",
    "spin and parity of the new levels are based on ado analysis , by assuming that transitions with r@xmath36 1.17 have stretched e2 character . the results for the 1941 , 2168 and 889 kev transitions lead therefore to i@xmath37 = 10@xmath4 for the state at 7.381 mev .",
    "we could not extract the angular distribution of the 2735 kev and 2753 kev @xmath3ray transitions depopulating the 4@xmath38 and 5@xmath27 states , respectively , since their broadened lineshapes are overlapping .",
    "the spin assignment for the states decaying via these two transitions are based on previous measurements . in ref .",
    "@xcite the angular distribution of the 2735 kev transition was found to be compatible with an e2 character .",
    "this assignment is now supported by the observation of a 1286 kev transition connecting the 6@xmath31 state to the 4@xmath31 state .",
    "a level at 5138@xmath284 kev excitation energy decaying towards the 4@xmath4 yrast state was also reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ; later on  @xcite , a 5@xmath27 assignment has been given to that state .",
    "this brings a @xmath30i=1 character for the new measured @xmath3ray transitions of 1553 kev and 2753 kev .",
    "the 5@xmath27 assignment is also confirmed by the e2 character of the 740 kev @xmath3-ray feeding the 3@xmath27 state .      to perform the analysis of the doppler broadened lineshapes we sorted the data in seven 4k x 4k @xmath3@xmath3coincidence matrices , each corresponding to the coincidence between the detectors of one ring and all other detectors .",
    "we have analyzed the @xmath3ray spectra in coincidence with the 850 kev @xmath3ray ( which does not show any appreciable broadening ) in order to select better the channel of interest and to reduce as much as possible the contaminations on the lineshapes of the relevant transitions .",
    "the 10@xmath4@xmath29 8@xmath39 and 10@xmath4@xmath29 8@xmath38 @xmath3ray transitions do not exhibit a broadened lineshape , indicating that the 10@xmath4 state has a long lifetime ( longer than a few ps ) .",
    "changes in the lineshape for states below were observed only when a large amount of side feeding was present ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the lifetime analysis was carried out with the computer code lineshape  @xcite . the slowing down process and",
    "the scattering of the recoils in the target and in the backing were described by a monte carlo simulation as it was developed by bacelar _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , with a modification regarding the spread in the initial direction of the recoils due to the evaporation of light particles  @xcite .",
    "the simulation was performed with 5000 histories and up to 187 time steps covering the recoil range in the backing .",
    "northcliffe and schilling  @xcite electronic stopping power values have been used in the calculations .",
    "the program performs a @xmath40 minimization of the lineshape fit as a function of the level lifetime , the side - feeding time and the normalization factors .",
    "we have used a one step side - feeding for each level , the side - feeding intensity being a fix parameter in the program . the background and the intensity of contaminant peaks present in the spectra",
    "have been kept fixed .",
    "the analysis was done for each line separately starting with the highest transition in the level scheme .",
    "lineshapes were fitted at forward and backward angles simultaneously allowing a better identification of the contaminants .",
    "the program , designed to deal with cascades of @xmath3rays connecting states with side - feeding originating only from the continuum , is not suited for level schemes such as that of @xmath0fe .",
    "anyway , it could be used also in our case by properly transforming the complex feeding scheme in equivalent @xmath3ray cascades . we have first determined the lifetimes of the two 8@xmath4 states from the analysis of the two decay branches , 10@xmath41 8@xmath42 6@xmath14 and 10@xmath41 8@xmath43 6@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the lifetime of the yrast 6@xmath4 state has been extracted by analyzing the decay pattern along the yrast sequence . to account for the feeding provided via the decay of the 8@xmath38 state , we have introduced above the 6@xmath14 state a virtual level with zero lifetime and side - feeding time given by the lifetime of the 8@xmath31 state .",
    "the intensity of the 1021 kev transition has been modified to account for the whole longlived population of the 6@xmath14 level provided by the decay of the 10@xmath4 state .",
    "the lifetime of the second 6@xmath4 state has been extracted from the analysis of the sequence of @xmath3ray transitions 10@xmath41 8@xmath43 6@xmath43 4@xmath14 . in order to describe the multiple feeding of the 4@xmath14 state",
    ", we have again introduced virtual levels of mean lifetime equal to zero and side - feeding times given by the lifetimes of the 6@xmath31 and 5@xmath27 states , respectively . in fig .",
    "4 the best fits for the lineshapes ( measured at 72@xmath17 ) of several @xmath3ray transitions are displayed .",
    "the lineshape of the 2035 kev transition is strongly contaminated by the presence of the 2045 kev line belonging to @xmath23cr with a very pronounced lineshape .",
    "we have determined the lifetime of the 8@xmath14 state from the best fit of the experimental spectrum with that obtained after summing the calculated lineshape of the 2035 kev @xmath3ray transition and the experimental lineshape of the contaminant line .",
    "the two lines of 2735 and 2753 kev overlapped their lineshapes and consequently , we could not extract a definite lifetime value for the 4@xmath38 and 5@xmath27 states .",
    "we estimated a lower limit of about 1 ps for the sidefeeding of the 4@xmath39 provided via the 2753 kev transition .",
    "we have varied this sidefeeding time in the range 0.52.0 ps without practically affecting the mean lifetime value of the 4@xmath39 state .",
    "the obtained results are reported in table [ table2 ] together with the previous measured values .",
    "the experimental reduced transition probabilities @xmath44 have been extracted according to the expression  @xcite : @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the branching ratio of the @xmath3ray transition , @xmath47 is the lifetime of the state in picoseconds , @xmath48 is the energy of the transition in mev and @xmath49 is the total conversion coefficient .",
    "these @xmath44 values are compared to the ones calculated within the sm ( see sect .",
    "the structure of @xmath0fe has been analyzed in the framework of the spherical shell model in the full @xmath6 shell ( @xmath50-scheme dimension 109,954,620 ) .",
    "these calculations have shown to reproduce with very good accuracy the experimental data of the nuclei in this mass region  @xcite .",
    "the single particle energies were taken from the @xmath51ca experimental spectrum and the effective interaction used was the kb3  @xcite .",
    "the effects of core polarization on the quadrupole properties were taken into account by using the effective charges @xmath52=1.5 and @xmath53=0.5 .",
    "the hamiltonian was treated by the lanczos method and diagonalized with the code antoine  @xcite .",
    "the resulting theoretical level scheme is compared in fig .  5 with the experimental one .",
    "a fairly good agreement is found .",
    "the energy inversion of the 12@xmath4 isomeric state with the 10@xmath4 yrast is reproduced theoretically , even if the energy gap between the two states is smaller than in the experiment .",
    "a reasonable reproduction of the energy spectrum is not enough to establish the goodness of the shell model calculations .",
    "a more stringent test is their ability to reproduce the experimental lifetimes or the @xmath44 values .",
    "the calculated @xmath44 values are displayed in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "they are in good agreement with the experimental ones .",
    "the values for the 6@xmath31 and the 8@xmath31 states seem to be not very well described by the calculations but this can be due to the vicinity in energy to the states of the same spin and parity ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the shell model calculations provide also the spectroscopic quadrupole moments @xmath54 which are plotted in the lowest panel of fig .",
    "large negative values are obtained for the first two excited states . as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath0fe behaves as a rotor below @xmath55 , consistently with a @xmath56 band . using the rotational model prescription we obtained for the 2@xmath4 and",
    "4@xmath4 states an intrinsic quadrupole moment @xmath57e  @xmath58 from both the theoretical @xmath44 values and the spectroscopic quadrupole moments .",
    "the deduced deformation parameter is @xmath59 . at @xmath55 ,",
    "@xmath54 changes sign and takes a very small value .",
    "this change of regime can be associated to the process of particle alignment . in this mass region ,",
    "the most deformed nuclei lay in the middle of the shell . in particular",
    ", the nucleus @xmath8cr has the maximum number of particles to develop quadrupole collectivity . at high spin",
    ", the interplay between single particle and collective degrees of freedom produces changes of shape towards spherical or non collective oblate states .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the mechanism of generating angular momentum by aligning the valence particle spins along the rotational axis in a high - j shell becomes energetically favoured at high frequency .",
    "nuclei as @xmath0fe which do not lay near the middle of the shell , are not much deformed and the incipient rotational behaviour at low spin smears out very soon with increasing angular momentum .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the development of quadrupole coherence that gives rise to rotational  like bands in these nuclei  @xcite , is originated by the mixing of the @xmath7 and @xmath60 orbits .",
    "it is thus interesting to follow the single orbital contributions to the wavefunction as the angular momentum increases . in fig .",
    "6 , the fractional occupation numbers of the @xmath7 and @xmath60 orbits are plotted for the yrast states of @xmath0fe . for comparison ,",
    "the same quantities are also reported for its cross conjugate nucleus @xmath61ti and for the most quadrupole deformed nucleus in the @xmath7 shell , @xmath8cr . in the simple @xmath62 model , @xmath0fe and @xmath61ti",
    "should have the same energy spectra ( cross conjugate symmetry ) .",
    "in fact , the two level schemes are similar at low spin .",
    "however , the symmetry is lost at high spin : there is no inversion of the 10@xmath4 and 12@xmath4 states in @xmath61ti .",
    "then , even if from a qualitative analysis of fig .  6 the @xmath7 subshell results by large the most occupied one , the contribution arising from the rest of the orbitals in the @xmath6 shell becomes crucial to obtain a good description of these nuclei .",
    "the fractional occupation number of the @xmath60 orbital is much more important than the other two orbitals @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( not included in the figure ) . at low spin",
    ", the @xmath60 occupation number remains almost constant for all three nuclei .",
    "the biggest @xmath60 contribution is observed for the most deformed nucleus @xmath8cr , where it begins to decrease at the backbending ( @xmath65 ) . in @xmath0fe",
    "this happens much earlier , at @xmath55 .    at the maximum spin that can be constructed with the valence particles in the @xmath7 shell ,",
    "the @xmath60 occupation number vanishes for @xmath61ti ( @xmath66 ) and becomes insignificant for @xmath8cr ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "also the smaller contribution from the @xmath63 and @xmath64 decreases at high spin and at the band terminating states the @xmath7 becomes the only relevant orbit .",
    "these fully - aligned band - terminating states are of non collective character .",
    "the situation is different in @xmath0fe , where above @xmath55 , the @xmath60shell contribution stays almost constant as a function of spin and the same happens for the other components , even at @xmath66 .",
    "there is still some quadrupole coherence in the 12@xmath4 state .",
    "this can be related to the energy inversion of the 10@xmath4 and 12@xmath4 states , which gives rise to the yrast trap , as will be shown below .",
    "the change of regime at @xmath55 , reflected in the fractional occupation numbers and in the spectroscopic quadrupole moments , can be related in the rotational model to a crossing between the ground state @xmath56 band and an excited @xmath68 band . to study this problem",
    "we have computed different nilsson intrinsic states and projected them onto good angular momentum .",
    "the @xmath56 band corresponds to an intrinsic state obtained by filling the [ 330]1/2 , [ 321]3/2 , [ 312]5/2 nilsson orbitals for protons and neutrons .",
    "the intrinsic state of the @xmath68 band is constructed by exciting one proton _ or _",
    "one neutron from the [ 312]5/2 to the [ 303]7/2 orbital .",
    "our calculations indicate that the @xmath69 @xmath68 and the @xmath69 @xmath56 are degenerate .",
    "this also explains the presence of two 6@xmath4 levels close in energy ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the states between the 6@xmath4 and the 10@xmath4 could be thus considered as a mixing of a @xmath56 and a @xmath68 band .",
    "we can not speak of a well defined intrinsic state .",
    "we repeated this procedure for the state at @xmath66 , where there is a residual quadrupole coherence .",
    "a @xmath70 intrinsic prolate nilsson state can be constructed by exciting two particles , a proton _ and _ a neutron , from the [ 312]5/2 to the [ 303]7/2 orbit . after projecting this state onto good angular momentum ,",
    "an overlap of @xmath22  0.9 with the exact shell model wave function of the 12@xmath4 state is obtained .",
    "the excitation energy of this level is lower than the @xmath65 and @xmath66 states coming from the @xmath56 and @xmath68 bands , which explains the presence of the yrast trap .",
    "excited nuclear states in the vicinity of closed shells are explained through the rearrangement of the nucleons in the available single particle orbitals .",
    "this results usually in irregular decay patterns and isomeric states , often called , at high spins , `` yrast traps '' .",
    "the isomeric 12@xmath4 state in @xmath0fe represents an energy spin yrast trap due to the large difference of its spin with those of the lower states .",
    "several high spin yrast traps have been identified along the periodic table but only few of them originate through the inversion in energy with yrast states of lower spins .",
    "such yrast traps have been identified in @xmath71fe  @xcite , @xmath71co  @xcite , @xmath72hf  @xcite , @xmath73po  @xcite and @xmath74po  @xcite .",
    "the nature of the energy spin traps can be related  @xcite to the alignment of nucleons .",
    "the nucleons with aligned spins gain energy because their residual interaction is stronger for wave functions with large spatial overlap ( mona effect  @xcite ) .",
    "in most of the cases the structure of these states is associated with oblate deformation or `` single particle '' rotations .",
    "a different structure is , however , found in @xmath0fe where the effect of the maximum alignment is accompanied by a quadrupole coherence that gives rise to a prolate deformation at @xmath66 , as stated in the previous subsection .    in fig .  7a",
    ", the yrast bands of the even - even n = z nuclei @xmath61ti , @xmath8cr and @xmath0fe are shown up to the maximum spin that can be built in the @xmath7 shell .",
    "the nucleus @xmath8cr , is presented to stress the evolution of the collectivity along the n = z line .",
    "the similarity between the level structure for @xmath61ti and @xmath0fe can be seen up to spin 10@xmath1 but in @xmath61ti , even if the energy of the 12@xmath4 state is lowered due to the alignment of the valence nucleons , no inversion is observed .",
    "as discussed in the previous subsection , in @xmath61ti and @xmath8cr the @xmath66 and @xmath67 levels , respectively , behave as non collective band terminating states with pure @xmath7 configurations . on the other hand ,",
    "the 12@xmath4 state in @xmath0fe still preserves contributions from the @xmath60 orbital , the nucleus is slightly prolate deformed and therefore more collective .    in fig .  7b , one can see the systematics of other yrast traps in this mass region .",
    "the nucleus @xmath71fe and its mirror @xmath71co present yrast traps at @xmath75 at an excitation energy around 3 mev that lay below the 15/2@xmath27 states .",
    "the 19/2@xmath27 level in @xmath71fe decays by @xmath3 emission of e4 , m5 and e6 character , while in @xmath71co decays @xmath5 . in these cases",
    "the yrast traps are also well reproduced by the shell model calculations . in the nilsson calculation , we obtain a prolate @xmath76 state for @xmath71fe ( @xmath71co ) by exciting one of the protons ( neutrons ) from the [ 312]5/2 to the [ 303]7/2 and coupling them to the odd neutron ( proton ) . as in the case of the @xmath77 @xmath0fe ,",
    "these aligned collective states are favoured in energy and become yrast traps .",
    "these mirror nuclei do not behave as their cross conjugates @xmath78 .",
    "in fact , in @xmath79ti and @xmath79sc there are isomeric 19/2@xmath27 states at about 3  mev excitation energy but higher in energy with respect to the 15/2@xmath27 states to which they decay by @xmath3 emission .",
    "the systematics shows that the cross conjugate symmetry is not verified in these nuclei .",
    "one can interpret these differences in terms of deformation or available valence space .",
    "in fact , at the beginning of the shell , @xmath61ti together with the mirrors @xmath78 , have a reduced number of particles and the fully aligned states are of pure @xmath62 configuration of non - collective character . for the heavier group of nuclei ,",
    "the maximum spin state is slightly prolate deformed due to the contribution of the @xmath60 orbit and yrast traps can be formed .",
    "we have investigated high spin states in @xmath0fe in a backed target experiment . the high detection efficiency of the gasp array and the relatively large amount of side - feeding population of the states of interest allowed us to establish the level scheme up to spin @xmath65 , a fact which was hindered until now by the presence of the 12@xmath4 yrast trap .",
    "we could therefore establish experimentally that the retardation of the decay of the 12@xmath4 yrast state is due to its location at an energy lower than that of the 10@xmath4 state .",
    "the mean lifetime of the states have been determined by means of the doppler shift attenuation method .",
    "the experimental results have been compared with calculations performed within the spherical sm in the _ pf _ shell .",
    "reasonably good agreement has been found for both the energy of the states and the @xmath44 values .",
    "the difference between the 12@xmath4 states in the cross conjugate nuclei @xmath61ti and @xmath0fe can be satisfactorily explained through shell model calculations . it was concluded that apart from the lowering of the states due the maximal overlapping of the nucleonic wave functions , in @xmath0fe this state is even lower due to a higher degree of collectivity present in the structure of the wave function related to the contribution of the @xmath60 orbital .",
