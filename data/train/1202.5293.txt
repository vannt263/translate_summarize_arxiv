    "in the studies of the hydrodynamical transport of confined cylinders  @xcite , it has usually been assumed that , in the absence of vortex shedding , the motion of the cylinder is steady : the cylinder translates with constant velocity and , in some cases , rotates with a constant angular velocity and at a fixed transverse distance from the mid plane of the gap .    following these views , non",
    "- stationary flows would only appear at reynolds numbers , @xmath6 , above the vortex shedding threshold .",
    "the present work demonstrates instead , at lower reynolds numbers , a periodic non - stationary transport regime due to another type of flow instability strongly influenced by the viscosity .",
    "early studies of the torque and drag forces on a cylinder facing a flow have been performed in the stokes regime or at relatively small reynolds numbers . for particles placed in the centre of the channel ,",
    "faxen @xcite derived the expression of the drag for a confinement @xmath4 less then @xmath5 ; the case of higher confinements has been recently considered by ben richou and co workers @xcite .",
    "an eccentered cylinder experiences in addition a positive torque decreasing sharply in the vicinity of the walls  @xcite ; for a cylinder translating closely along a wall or held fixed in a poiseuille flow , this torque tends to generate a rotation of sign opposite to that of contact rolling .",
    "this results from the backflow near the second wall and has a sizable influence on the force distribution on the cylinder @xcite .    the displacement of a free cylinder released from an eccentric position inside a vertical gap has been computed by hu  @xcite for three values of the reynolds number @xmath6 . for @xmath16 ,",
    "the cylinder reaches a final stable transverse position in the middle of the gap . for @xmath17 ,",
    "instead , an off - axis cylinder rotates in the direction opposite to the previous one , resulting in a lift force oriented away from the axis : this was accounted for by the appearance of a recirculation zone  @xcite .",
    "however , as the cylinder approaches one of the walls , the recirculation zone recedes because of the interaction between the wake and the wall boundary layer .",
    "the rotation and the lift force then change sign again , so that a stable off - axis position is finally found .",

    "<S> an oscillatory instability has been observed experimentally on an horizontal cylinder free to move and rotate between two parallel vertical walls of distance @xmath0 ; its characteristics differ both from vortex shedding driven oscillations and from those of tethered cylinders in the same geometry . the vertical motion of the cylinder , its rotation about its axis and its transverse motion across the gap have been investigated as a function of its diameter @xmath1 , its density @xmath2 , of the mean vertical velocity @xmath3 of the fluid and of its viscosity . for a blockage ratio @xmath4 above @xmath5 and a reynolds number @xmath6 larger then @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> oscillations of the rolling angle of the cylinder about its axis and of its transverse coordinate in the gap are observed together with periodic variations of the vertical velocity . </S>",
    "<S> their frequency @xmath8 is the same for the sedimentation of the cylinder in a static fluid ( @xmath9 ) and for a non - zero mean flow ( @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the strouhal number @xmath11 associated to the oscillation varies as @xmath12 with : @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding period @xmath14 is then independent of @xmath3 and corresponds to a characteristic viscous diffusion time over a distance @xmath15 , implying a strong influence of the viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> these characteristics differ from those of vortex shedding and tethered cylinders for which @xmath11 is instead roughly constant with @xmath6 and higher than here . </S>"
