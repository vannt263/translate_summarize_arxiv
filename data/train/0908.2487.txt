    "polyzwitterions@xcite belong to a special class of polyampholytes@xcite , where each monomer carries both the positive and negative charges .",
    "different kinds of polyzwitterions@xcite have been synthesized by varying the length of the zwitterionic unit , the spacing and the functionality of the group attaching the zwitterionic unit to the chain backbone . also ,",
    "depending on the synthesis scheme , polyzwitterions can be prepared without any counterions of the charged moieties on the zwitterionic unit or with counterions . in the literature ,",
    "a major class of such molecules are known as betaines@xcite and , depending on the functionality of the negatively charged site on the zwitterionic unit , are called sulfo- ( i.e. , sulphonate group in the zwitterion unit ) , carbo- ( carboxylate group ) and phospho- ( phosphate ) betaines .",
    "these molecules have a wide variety of applications@xcite in medicine , biotechnology and oil industry .    since the synthesis of first polyzwitterionic molecule in 1957@xcite ,",
    "a number of experimental studies@xcite have been carried out on this special class of polyampholytes .",
    "one of the well - known signatures of these molecules is their insolubility in water despite the presence of charged groups .",
    "furthermore , it is observed that the addition of salt enhances the solubility of these molecules .",
    "this particular effect is known as `` anti - polyelectrolyte '' effect@xcite in the literature due to the opposite behavior seen in pure polyelectrolytes@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the enhancement in the solubility of these molecules in water has been shown to depend on the specific nature of the added salt@xcite . for polycarbobetaines",
    ", the solubility also depends on ph of the solution , due to the presence of an acid - base equilibrium mechanism in these systems .    in the literature@xcite , insolubility of polyzwitterions in pure water",
    "is explained on intutive grounds by the presence of attractive dipolar intra and inter - molecular interactions in salt - free conditions . despite the lack of screening in purely dipolar media@xcite ,",
    "the screening of attractive dipolar interactions by the added salt@xcite is conjectured to be responsible for the `` anti - polyelectrolyte '' effect .",
    "the minimum amount of salt required to solubilize the polyzwitterions@xcite is further observed to depend on specific interactions between the charged groups on the zwitterionic unit and the salt ions .",
    "sometimes@xcite , both the `` polyelectrolyte '' ( decrease in the solubility of these molecules in aqueous solutions with the addition of salt ) and `` anti - polyelectrolyte '' effects are observed in these systems . using zeta - potentiometry@xcite , it has been shown that the `` polyelectrolyte '' effect is a consequence of a net charge on the polyzwitterionic chain .",
    "the role of asymmetric counterion adsorption on the solubility of polyzwitterions has also been revealed using zeta - potentiometry .    on the theoretical front ,",
    "a number of studies have been carried out on polyampholyte solutions where the molecules contain both positive and negative charges _ along",
    "_ the backbone , starting from the work by edwards - king - pincus@xcite .",
    "the conformations of polyampholytes were investigated in detail by higgs and joanny@xcite , kantor and kardar@xcite and dobrynin and rubinstein@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the overall net charge@xcite of the chain , arising as a result of differential counterion adsorption on the positive and negative charges , plays a crucial role .",
    "furthermore , it has been predicted that depending on the extent of asymmetry in the counterion adsorption on the charged sites along the backbone , the polyampholyte chain may behave like a polyelectrolyte .",
    "also , the charge sequence along the polyampholyte chain@xcite and the formation of ionic bridges@xcite between the oppositely charged groups along the backbone have been shown to affect the conformational behavior .",
    "in contrast to these polyampholyte models , polyzwitterions bear zwitterionic side - groups carrying both positive and negative charges on the same monomeric unit .",
    "the presence of the positive and negative charges on the same monomer implies that dipolar interactions@xcite are of paramount importance in these systems , which complicates the analysis .",
    "so far , polyzwitterions have received little attention from the theoretical community .    in this work",
    ", we consider a single polyzwitterionic chain and derive quantitative relations between the radius of gyration of the chain and the added salt concentration using a variational technique@xcite that was previously applied to neutral polymers@xcite and polyelectrolytes@xcite . with the aid of these relations ,",
    "experimental observations regarding the solubility of polyzwitterions can be inferred . here , an increase or decrease in the solubility of polymers on changing experimental conditions is inferred from the increase or decrease in the radius of gyration of the chain , respectively . using the radius of gyration as a gauge for measuring the solubility of polymers , concepts of poor , theta and good solvent conditions",
    "have already been developed for neutral polymers@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we carry out a similar analysis for a polyzwitterionic chain and study the effect of added salt on the radius of gyration of the chain , which , in turn , is used to infer the effect of added salt on the solubility of polyzwitterionic molecules .    before presenting the theoretical outline of this paper , we summarize the assumptions and key results of the model for those who are uninterested in the mathematical details .",
    "\\(i ) we model the polyzwitterionic chain of @xmath0 kuhn segments by a continuous curve of length @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the length of each segment , where each segment has a dipole of length @xmath3 attached to it at an angle .",
    "we consider the situation in which the chain is surrounded by two kinds ( positive and negative ) of monovalent small ions arising from the dissociation of the zwitterionic monomers along with those coming from the added monovalent salt .",
    "we assume that there are @xmath4 positive and @xmath5 negative counterions released by the zwitterionic monomers .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the negative ( @xmath6 being the electronic charge ) and positive charges ( @xmath7 ) are distributed uniformly among the negative and positive sites , respectively .",
    "also , the interactions between the segments with electric dipoles are modeled by a short range delta function pseudopotential of strength @xmath8 and the long range electrostatic interactions between the charges of the electric dipoles . dividing the population of the small ions into ones free to move in the solution ( called `` free '' ions ) and those , which are adsorbed on the zwitterionic monomers ( `` adsorbed '' ions ) , we compute the radius of gyration of the polyzwitterionic chain using a variational method in case the electric dipoles can rotate freely .",
    "\\(ii ) the counterion adsorption in the presence of the small ions near the polyzwitterionic chain complicates the situation .",
    "this is because the counterion adsorption leads to the formation of small dipoles at the adsorption sites .",
    "so , the description of the segment - segment interactions must include the charge - charge and charge - dipole interactions in addition to the dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "integrating over the positions of the `` free '' ions , it is found that in addition to the well - known debye - hckel screening of the charge - charge interactions , charge - dipole and dipole - dipole interactions also get screened . for a charge of magnitude @xmath9 ( in units of electronic charge ) and a dipole of moment @xmath10 ( in units of electronic charge ) located at @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively ,",
    "charge - dipole interaction energy ( in units of @xmath13 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath14 being the temperature ) is found to be @xmath15\\left[\\mathbf{p}.(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}')\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is bjerrum s length written in terms of the relative permittivity @xmath17 of the medium , @xmath18 being the permittivity of vacumm . also , @xmath19 is debye length having contributions from only the `` free '' small ions in the solution given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the positive , negative ions dissociated from the zwitterionic monomers and the added salt . for the charge and a freely rotating dipole",

    "note that putting @xmath31 in the above expressions , well - known functional form the bare charge - dipole and dipole - dipole interaction energies@xcite are obtained .",
    "\\(iii ) the radius of gyration of the polyzwitterionic chain is found to be dependent on an intricate interplay of charge - charge , charge - dipole and dipole - dipole interactions in addition to the short range excluded volume interactions . in this work ,",
    "we show the possibility of an attraction dominated and a repulsion dominated regime . in the attraction dominated regime , dipolar interactions dominate over all the other interactions .",
    "for example , in the absence of the small ions , segment - segment interactions are described by the short range excluded volume interactions and the dipole - dipole interactions . in this case , the radius of gyration ( @xmath32 ) is to be obtained from the relation @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are _ renormalized _ two body and three body excluded volume parameters , given by eqs .",
    "(  [ eq : w2 ] ) and (  [ eq : nu ] ) , respectively .",
    "these parameters depend on the bjerrum s length and the magnitude of the dipole moment of the zwitterionic monomers ( @xmath36 ) . from eq .",
    "(  [ eq : w2 ] ) , it is clear that for strong enough dipole - dipole interactions ( characterized by the parameter @xmath37 ) , @xmath34 may become negative even for good solvents ( i.e. , positive _ bare _ excluded volume parameter @xmath8 ) and eq .",
    "(  [ eq : size_salt_free_intro ] ) becomes the well - known relation describing a globule or a polymer chain in a poor solvent . in other words ,",
    "our model predicts that a globule is the equilibrium state for strong enough dipolar interactions so that @xmath34 is negative .",
    "however , the presence of the small ions leads to the counterion adsorption on the zwitterionic monomers and the screening of the dipolar interactions . taking into account the effects of the charge - charge and charge - dipole interactions in addition to the dipole - dipole interactions , the radius of gyration in the attraction dominated regime for the uniform distribution of charges on the zwitterionic sites is to be obtained from @xmath38 here , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are given by eqs .",
    "(  [ eq : wcd ] ) , (  [ eq : gamma ] ) , (  [ eq : nu ] ) , and (  [ eq : w_eff ] ) , respectively . from eq .",
    "(  [ eq : size_salt_attraction_intro ] ) and (  [ eq : w_eff ] ) , it is found that @xmath41 increases with the increase in @xmath42 in the regime @xmath43 , which corresponds to a compact globule .",
    "physically , the increase in @xmath41 with an increase in @xmath42 corresponds to the opening up of the compact globule due to the screening of the attractive dipolar interactions .",
    "a key prediction of the model is the dependence of the degree of ionization of the zwitterionic monomers on the self - energy of the dipoles , charge - dipole and dipole - dipole pairs ( given by eqs .",
    "(  [ eq : ea_cc ] ) , (  [ eq : ea_cd ] ) and (  [ eq : ea_dd ] ) , respectively ) , formed as a result of the counterion adsorption .",
    "an asymmetric counterion adsorption on the positive and negative sites of the zwitterionic monomers is predicted for different adsorption energies of the two kinds of counterions .",
    "the adsorption energies ( cf .",
    "(  [ eq : ea_cc ] ) ) are characterized by the local inhomogenieties in the dielectric constant near each kind of ions and the length of the dipole or ion - pair formed due to adsorption .    for an asymmetric counterion adsorption",
    ", the repulsive charge - charge interactions may dominate over the attractive dipolar interactions .",
    "the cross - over from the attraction to repulsion dominated regime is characterized by @xmath44 . in the repulsion dominated regime ,",
    "the radius of gyration is given by @xmath45 in the weak screening limit @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the strong screening limit @xmath48 .",
    "comparing eqs .",
    "(  [ eq : size_salt_repulsion_intro ] ) and (  [ eq : size_salt_high2_intro ] ) with those for polyelectrolytes@xcite , it is found that the polyzwitterionic chain behaves like a polyelectrolyte with the net charge equal to @xmath49 .",
    "note that in this regime so that @xmath50 , the screening of electrostatic interactions lead to the decrease in the radius of gyration in contrast to the attraction dominated regime , where the screening leads to an increase in the radius of gyration . also , note the dependence of the parameter characterizing the cross - over from an attraction to repulsion dominated regime ( i.e. , @xmath51 ) on the salt concentration .",
    "hence , the cross - over depends on the ionic strength related to @xmath42 and the net charge on the polyzwitterionic chain .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the formalism is presented in section  [ sec : theory ] , our results for the conformational characteristics of polyzwitterions are presented in section  [ sec : results ] , and section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we consider a single flexible polyzwitterionic chain of @xmath0 kuhn segments , each with length @xmath2 in a spherical volume @xmath52 . the polyzwitterionic chain is represented as a continuous curve of length @xmath1 , and an arc length variable @xmath53",
    "is used to represent any segment along the backbone so that @xmath54 $ ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] ) . also , we assume that each segment has a dipole of length @xmath3 attached to it , which can rotate freely .",
    "physically , this corresponds to a chain with zwitterionic side - groups attached to it , which carry both the monovalent positive and negative sites separated by a spacer of length @xmath3 . by taking the dipole length attached to each segment to be the same , we have assumed that the distance between the positive and negative sites on the zwitterionic side groups is the same for each monomer and remains fixed irrespective of the conformational state of the chain .",
    "the distance is governed mainly by the chemistry of the macromolecule and typically , it is around three to four methylene groups ( e.g. , in poly - suphobetaines ) , which is about @xmath55 nm and amounts to a dipole moment of @xmath56 d for monovalent charged sites compared to a dipole moment of @xmath57 d for gaseous water ( monomeric dipole - moment is represented by @xmath58 for univalently charged groups ) . to have a general picture , we consider that there are @xmath59 and @xmath60 positive and negative counterions released by the negative and positive groups on the zwitterionic monomers , respectively .",
    "in addition to this , we assume that there are @xmath61 and @xmath62 positive and negative monovalent salt ions in the system .",
    "overall , the system is electroneutral .",
    "we denote by @xmath63 the valency ( with sign ) of the charged species @xmath64 and @xmath65 represent the positive , negative sites on the zwitterionic groups , positive , negative counterions from the zwitterionic monomers , positive and negative salt ions , respectively .    in order to study the effect of counterion adsorption on conformational characteristics in such a complicated multi - component system , we use the so - called `` two - state '' model@xcite for the counterions so that there are two populations of counterions .",
    "one population of the counterions is free to enjoy the available volume ( called the `` free '' counterions ) and the other population is `` adsorbed '' on the backbone .",
    "however , the adsorbed counterions are allowed to move along the backbone . in the literature",
    ", this kind of charge distribution has been referred to as a `` permuted '' charge distribution@xcite . in the case of polyzwitterions , there are two kinds of counterions coming from the positive and negative charged sites of the zwitterionic monomers .",
    "we denote the degree of ionization of the negative and positive sites on the chain by @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , so that there are @xmath68 and @xmath69 `` free '' counterions coming from the negative and positive zwitterionic sites , respectively . in other words , there are @xmath70 `` adsorbed '' counterions on the chain and @xmath71 is the net charge on the chain , @xmath72 being the charge on an electron .",
    "we compute the radius of gyration of a single polyzwitterionic chain in the presence of its counterions , the added salt ions , and the solvent ( treated implicitly in this work as a uniform dielectric medium ) using the variational formalism presented below .      here ,",
    "we present the variational formalism to compute the radius of gyration of a polyzwitterionic chain surrounded by small ions . in the presence of small ions",
    ", it can be shown that not only the charge - charge but also the charge - dipole and dipole - dipole interactions are screened ( appendix a ) . using the functional forms for the screened interaction potentials derived in appendix a , we can study the effective size of a polyzwitterionic chain in the presence of salt .",
    "however , the formation of small dipoles as a result of counterion adsorption complicates the situation . for the discussion here",
    ", we consider the case of monovalent salt and assume that the counterion adsorption of the positive and negative ions from the solution on the chain leads to dipoles having dipole moments @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "there may also be bridging effects due to the presence of oppositely charged species along the backbone .",
    "we can study this particular effect within uniform expansion model considered here by introducing another parameter @xmath75 , which is the fraction of monomers involved in bridge formation .",
    "bridging can be accounted for by adding a net attractive contribution to the excluded volume parameter@xcite , which arises from a balance between ionic attractions and a conformational entropy penalty for bridges .",
