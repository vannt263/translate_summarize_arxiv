    "impulsive systems @xcite are an important class of hybrid systems admitting discontinuities in the state trajectories , that are governed by discrete - time maps .",
    "they occur in several fields like epidemiology @xcite , sampled - data and networked control systems @xcite , forestry @xcite , power electronics @xcite , harvesting problems @xcite , etc . among the wide class of impulsive dynamical systems",
    ", we may distinguish between systems whose impulse - times depend on the system state and those for which the impulse - times are external to system and only time - dependent .",
    "the latter class may be represented in the following form @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the state of the system and the initial condition , respectively .",
    "the system matrices are possibly uncertain , i.e. @xmath2 where @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the convex hull .",
    "the state trajectory is assumed to be left - continuous and to have right - limits at all time .",
    "the notation @xmath6 denotes the right limit of @xmath7 as @xmath8 tends to @xmath9 from the right , i.e. @xmath10 . the set of impulsive times @xmath11 is a countable set of impulse instants @xmath12 , @xmath13 and we define the inter - impulse distance as @xmath14 .",
    "this quantity is also referred to as _ dwell - time _ in the literature .",
    "we also assume that the sequence @xmath15 has no accumulation point in order to exclude any zeno behavior .",
    "depending on the structure of the matrices @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the system may exhibit very different behaviors .",
    "in particular , notions of minimal and maximal dwell - time can be defined for impulsive systems @xcite , similarly as for switched systems @xcite . in the case of impulsive systems , these notions refer to system properties such that too large or too short dwell - times destabilize the system . in the case of periodic impulses with period @xmath18 , the problem essentially reduces to the study of the schurness of the matrix @xmath19 , which turns out to be a very simple problem .",
    "however , this formulation suffers from several critical drawbacks :    1 .",
    "the eigenvalue analysis is not extendable to the case of aperiodic impulses since the spectral radius is , in general , not submultiplicative ; 2 .   to overcome this , lyapunov approaches can be applied but lead to robust linear matrix inequalities ( lmis ) with scalar uncertainties at the exponential , known to be complex numerically , yet solvable @xcite ; 3 .",
    "the extension to robust stability analysis is also difficult , again due to the exponential terms .",
    "there is no efficient solution , at this time , to handle block matrix uncertainties at the exponential .",
    "the approach discussed in this paper aims at overcoming the above important drawbacks and brings an efficient solution for the characterization of robust - dwell times .",
    "the main tool used in this paper is an extension of the one developed in @xcite in the context of sampled - data systems , itself triggered by a somewhat different approach discussed in the anterior work @xcite where impulsive systems are considered for the representation of aperiodic sampled - data systems@xcite .",
    "the core of the approach relies on the implicit but equivalent correspondence between discrete- and continuous - time domains obtained in @xcite .",
    "it is shown there that discrete - time stability is equivalent to a certain kind of continuous - time stability , provided that the latter is proved using particular functionals referred to as _ looped - functionals_. one important feature of pointwise stability criteria is to allow for non - monotonic continuous - time lyapunov functions ( evaluated along the flow a system ) since only a pointwise decrease is imposed instead of a continuous one .",
    "a discrete - time criterion provides then a weaker condition for stability than classical continuous - time ones . in the case of impulsive systems , by studying the decrease of the lyapunov function evaluated at impulse - times only , non - monotonicity of the continuous - time lyapunov function between impulse - times may be tolerated .",
    "the interesting point of the method is its wide adaptability to any type of systems having discrete - events , or more generally time - marks , which are time - instants for which the system admits certain regularity properties . for sampled - data and impulsive systems ,",
    "these time - marks coincide with the control law update and impulse - times , respectively . hence , by looking at a discrete - time lyapunov function whose values at the marker - times are decreasing allows one to prove stability of the overall hybrid system .",
    "this concept is immediately extendable to other type of systems for which such marks may be defined .",
    "the looped - functional - based approach introduced above leads to lmi - conditions that are _ affine in the dwell - time _ , _ devoid of exponential terms _ and _ able to consider the jumps precisely _ through the non - monotonicity of the lyapunov function . indeed ,",
    "expansive jumps on a certain state can be tolerated as long as it decreases sufficiently between jumps .",
    "conversely , increasing between jumps is also allowed as long as the jumps are contracting .",
    "the obtained lmi conditions easily allow one to both characterize stability under periodic and aperiodic impulses .",
    "in both cases , the dwell - time @xmath20 plays an important role in the stability of the impulsive system .",
    "several stability concepts are considered in this paper : stability with minimal dwell - time @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the so - called _ minimal dwell - time _ , stability with maximal dwell - time @xmath23 $ ] where @xmath24 is the _ maximal - dwell time _",
    ", stability with ranged dwell - time @xmath25 $ ] and stability with arbitrary pulsing @xmath26 .",
    "the domains of application of these different dwell - time concepts are summarized in table [ tab : app ] .",
    "it is important to stress that the case ( 3,3 ) can not be handled using existing approaches , e.g. @xcite , since none of the system matrices are stable , while the proposed approach does not require such stability conditions on @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this emphasizes that the proposed approach better captures the internal structure of the system .",
    "thanks to the affine dependence of the obtained conditions on the system matrices , dwell - time notions are finally extended to the case of uncertain systems , a problem for which there is currently a lack of efficient solution techniques .",
    "it seems important to stress that since the paper has been submitted , several improvements have been made .",
