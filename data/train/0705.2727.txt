    "recent experimental studies of pbse nanocrystals ( ncs ) have revealed an unexpectedly fast intraband relaxation in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) with energy separation between adjacent electron ( or hole ) levels exceeding by far the optical phonon energies  .",
    "a pronounced temperature dependence of the observed relaxation rates   suggests that underlying mechanism should involve multiphonon transitions while auger - like relaxation processes   are ruled out due to a nearly symmetric energy spectra in the conduction and valence bands of pbse .",
    "the multiphonon transitions between otherwise orthogonal quantized electronic states in a qd may occur due to nonadiabaticity of the electron - phonon system  . a model study performed in conjunction with the experiments on pbse ncs revealed that , in order for this mechanism to be responsible for the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the relaxation rate , the electron - phonon coupling should be stronger than one would expect  .",
    "however , the study of detailed models of electron - phonon interaction in quantum dots ( upon which the judgement about the coupling strength is based ) has always been a weak point in approaches to energy relaxation   and raman   processes . in case of pbse ncs the situation",
    "is further obscured by the fact that the widely accepted model of their electronic structure   which would be natural to pick for an estimate of electron - phonon coupling strength fails to describe absorption spectra of pbse ncs   and is therefore not quite reliable . thus , instead of seeking to either confirm or rule out this mechanism we will concentrate on examining other possibilities for the fast energy relaxation .",
    "as it has been proposed for epitaxially grown qds  , such possibilities can be provided by a localized state of an impurity or defect close to the qd surface . in case of the experiment of ref .",
    "such states can correspond to deep impurities in the silica host surrounding pbse ncs occurring in an appreciable proximity to the nc surface .",
    "otherwise they can be due to surface states .",
    "an electron trapped to the impurity is strongly localized which assures its strong coupling to local lattice vibrations .",
    "one can then consider a relaxation process involving the interior qd levels as the initial ( @xmath0 ) and final ( @xmath1 ) states , and the state at the impurity as an intermediate ( @xmath2 ) state as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "although processes of this type have been theoretically investigated  , all these studies considered the relaxation as a two step process , so the relaxation time @xmath3 .",
    "but if @xmath4 is shorter than the phonon lifetime in state @xmath2 then the transition @xmath5 must be treated as a coherent quantum mechanical process .",
    "such process represents a new mechanism of phonon - assisted carrier relaxation in qds and its studying is the scope of the present work .",
    "similar processes have been considered for capture or generation of electron - hole pairs by impurities in bulk semiconductors     another system where the proposed mechanism can play the key role is provided by cdse colloidal nanocrystals . in the recent experiments on such quantum dots the fast intraband relaxation of electrons has been observed in the absence of the holes  .",
    "the electrons were injected into the quantum dots instead of being optically generated , and the pump - probe measurements were subsequently carried out  .",
    "these experiments showed that intraband relaxation times vary significantly with surface modification suggesting involvement of a surface state such as the empty @xmath6  -  state of the surface cd@xmath7 atoms  .",
    "a faster relaxation rate was observed for lower temperatures   though more thorough studies of the temperature dependences of the relaxation rate in cdse colloidal nanocrystals are desirable .",
    "it has been noticed   that multiphonon relaxation processes are analogous to tunneling problems in electron transport utilizing the tunneling hamiltonian .",
    "it turns out that the relaxation mechanism proposed in this paper is analogous to the problem of electron tunneling through a potential barrier placed between two leads and containing localized electronic states coupled to phonons and resonant with the energy of the tunneling electron .",
    "the latter problem was studied by glazman and shekhter  .",
    "there is , however , a substantial difference between the two problems due to the descrete energy spectrum for carriers confined in a qd .",
    "indeed , in the problem of electron tunneling there is a continuum of both initial and final states in the leads .",
    "thus , this problem has a characteristic time related to the elastic tunneling of the electron from the localized state to either of the leads and determining the width of the resonance .",
    "the rate of the phonon - assisted tunneling can be then calculated using some generalization of the fermi golden rule with the @xmath8-function accounting for the energy conservation being integrated out while summing over the continuum of final electronic states . in our problem",
    "the initial and final electronic states are descrete .",
    "however , the spectrum of the entire system `` electron plus phonons '' is continuous and the scheme of calculation of the transition rate proposed in ref .   can still be applied , although some changes should be introduced .",
    "first , the width of the resonance will be determined by the lifetime of phonons in the intermediate state .",
    "second , the phonon density of states will enter the expression for the transition rate .",
    "it turns out that these changes can be more naturally incorporated using a more traditional approach based on calculation of overlap integrals of eigenfunctions belonging to shifted parabolic potentials ( see e.g.  ) .",
    "another advantage of this method is that it allows one to make some qualitative conclusions without having done actual calculations .    in this paper",
    "the proposed mechanism of carrier relaxation will be studied in detail for a model qd system while discussions of its relevance to particular realizations of qds are left for future studies .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we formulate the problem in a form most convenient for comparison with the work by glazman and shekhter   and with the case of nonadiabaticity - induced phonon - assisted transitions between intrinsic qd states  .",

    "phonon decay should be taken into account as it determines the width of the resonance corresponding to the intermediate state in the relaxation problem under study . however , the problem of evaluating the correlation function  ( [ bigu ] ) taking the phonon decay into account is very difficult",
    ". therefore , in the next section we devise an approximation which allows one to account for phonon decay without evaluating correlation function  ( [ bigu ] ) .",
    "in order to understand the origin of the width of the resonance corresponding to the intermediate state in our relaxation problem we will consider an auxiliary problem which will help us to apply the concept of quasi - stationary states to the states of the system `` electron localized at the impurity plus phonons '' .",
    "more precisely , let us set @xmath45 and consider the electron localized at the impurity and coupled to phonons .",

    "the latter reflects what happens to the electron when it is suddenly brought to the impurity site from a remote location ( where it does not experience any coupling or entangling to phonons ) at @xmath41 . therefore",

    "the only difference is that , as @xmath50 , the auxiliary problem does not describe dynamics of the electron tunneling to the impurity site .",
