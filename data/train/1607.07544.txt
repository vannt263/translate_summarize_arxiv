    "recently , there are several works in connection with the differential calculus on fractals that involve derivatives , tangents , multiharmonic functions , higher order laplacians , analogous to the theory of analysis on manifolds .",

    "we only consider those @xmath0 symmetric fractals , since the full symmetric structures could provide many advantages for our discussion .",

    "we show how to extend the previous results to those p.c.f .",
    "self - similar sets with full symmetry , including some typical @xmath1 symmetric fractals , such as the tetrahedral sierpinski gasket and the vicsek sets .",
    "finally , in appendix , we provide a recursion algorithm for the exact calculations of the boundary values of the monomials introduced in section 3 , for some typical @xmath0 or @xmath1 symmetric fractals , which are important for results in section 3 .",
    "this algorithm is an improved version of the one developed in [ nsty ] , which presents to be more direct and shorter .",

    "now we could prove analogous results as stated in theorem 3.8 , for @xmath518 , providing that all the numbers @xmath589 are not equal to @xmath44 .",
    "the method is similar , except that when discussing the transverse derivatives , we need to look at the values @xmath590 and @xmath591 instead of the left side of @xmath592 . for the calculations of @xmath589 , see appendix .",
    "as an appendix of this paper , we focus on the calculation of @xmath593 , @xmath594 and @xmath194 , the boundary values of the monomials @xmath595",
    ". we will mainly discuss the @xmath0 symmetric fractals .",
    "the most typical example @xmath5 has been well studied in [ nsty ] , where an iterated calculation of the values as well as the derivatives of @xmath595 at the boundary were given . however , their method is indirect , since it involves the boundary values and inner products of functions in the `` easy '' basis , and need to transform data from the `` easy '' basis to our `` monomial '' basis .",
    "here we provide a new algorithm , which is more direct and shorter , using which , we could calculate @xmath193 and @xmath194 on some other examples , including @xmath118,@xmath119 .",

    "taking @xmath596 in ( 4.4 ) , we get a recursion relation , @xmath597 holding at all vertices @xmath598 for all @xmath335 . here in the second line of ( 7.1 ) , we use the identity @xmath599 .",
    "thus , assuming we already have the values @xmath600 , ( 7.1 ) as well as the self - similar identities ( 3.1)-(3.3 ) form a system of equations to calculate @xmath601 from the values @xmath602 .",
    "we do use this idea to solve the @xmath603 cases .            also , we need a notation of _ infinite dimensional semi - circulant matrices _ @xmath608 . for example , @xmath609 , has @xmath610 for @xmath611 and @xmath612 for @xmath613 .",
    "it is easy to check @xmath614 for @xmath611 , and the multiplications among these matices are commutable .",
    "we will need a linear operator @xmath615 on such matrices defined by @xmath616 where @xmath107 is the scaling constant of the laplacian defined before .",
    "first , for @xmath200 , by considering the symmetry , ( 7.2 ) becomes @xmath619 for @xmath335 , where we denote @xmath620 .",
    "in addition , for @xmath621 , we have @xmath622 we could rewrite the above identities in matrix notation , @xmath623 by multiplying them with @xmath624 on both sides , where @xmath625 is the infinite matrix defined with @xmath626 for @xmath611 and @xmath627 for @xmath613 . eliminating @xmath625 , we get @xmath628 which results that @xmath629 .",
    "so we get the recursion relation for @xmath593 .    for @xmath202 , we can write ( 7.2 ) into @xmath630 for @xmath191 , where we denote @xmath631 .",
    "thus by multiplying both sides with @xmath624 , we have @xmath632 with some calculation , we get @xmath633 which gives the recursion relation of @xmath594 .          thus , to prove that @xmath636 is determined by ( 7.4 ) uniquely",
    ", we only need to prove the equations @xmath641 has a unique solution @xmath642 , where @xmath643 is the symmetry that fixes @xmath127 and interchanges the other two vertices of @xmath24 .",
    "first we need to look at the equation @xmath644 it is not hard to check that @xmath645 is the unique solution of ( 7.6 ) , where @xmath436 is the harmonic function with the same boundary values as those of @xmath646 , from which , one can find that @xmath647    now suppose @xmath3 is a solution of ( 7.5 ) .",
