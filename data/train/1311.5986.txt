    "hence , studying these two classes is essentially equivalent .",
    "it is immediate from the definition that the classes @xmath33 and @xmath36 are `` symmetric around @xmath39 '' in the sense that a function @xmath3 belongs to the class @xmath33 ( @xmath36 ) if and only if so does the function @xmath40)$ ] .",
    "our first principal result shows that the above - defined function @xmath2 lies in the class @xmath36 and indeed , is the ( pointwise ) largest function of this class .",

    "we remark that substituting @xmath44 and @xmath45 into shows that all functions from the class @xmath36 are uniformly bounded from above , whence the function @xmath46 is well defined .",
    "it is not difficult to see that this function itself belongs to @xmath36 and is pointwise bounded from above by the function @xmath2 .",

    "these classes were introduced in @xcite , except that the functions from the class @xmath53 ( up to the normalization ) are known as @xmath34-_midconvex _ and under this name have been studied in a number of papers ; see , for instance , @xcite . as shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  3 ) , every concave function from the class @xmath36 belongs to all classes @xmath48 .",

    "we use the following notation . given two subsets @xmath58 of a finite abelian group @xmath9 , we consider the directed cayley graph , induced by @xmath8 on @xmath9 , and we write @xmath59 for the edge - boundary of @xmath7 ; that is , @xmath59 is number of edges in this graph from an element of @xmath7 to an element in its complement @xmath11 : @xmath60 equivalently , @xmath59 is the number of edges between @xmath7 and @xmath11 in the _ undirected _ cayley graph induced on @xmath9 by the set @xmath61 .    as a consequence of corollary  [ c : finfm ] ( thus , ultimately , of theorem  [ t : max - f ] ) , we prove    [ t : isoper ] let @xmath7 and @xmath8 be subsets of a finite abelian group @xmath9 , of which @xmath8 is generating .",
    "if @xmath10 is a positive integer such that the order of every element of @xmath8 does not exceed @xmath10 , then @xmath62    our proof of theorem  [ t : isoper ] is a variation of the argument used in ( * ? ? ?",

    "for instance , if @xmath9 is the symmetric group of order @xmath64 , and @xmath63 consists of two involutions , then the cayley graph induced on @xmath9 by @xmath8 is a bi - directional cycle of length @xmath65 .",
    "consequently , for a non - empty proper subset @xmath66 inducing a path in this cycle , one has @xmath67 ( as @xmath68 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 ) .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the sharpness of the estimate of theorem  [ t : isoper ] and to determine whether the function @xmath2 in its right - hand side can be replaced with a larger function .",

    "we conclude that the factor @xmath75 in the right - hand side is optimal , and the function @xmath2 can not be replaced with a larger function .    as shown in (",
    "* theorem  6 ) , for each @xmath47 , the functions @xmath76 are well - defined and belong themselves to the classes @xmath48 , and ( * ? ? ?",

    "it is natural to investigate the infimum @xmath77 .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that this infimum can be found explicitly , even though the individual functions @xmath78 are known for @xmath79 only ( see  ( * ? ? ? * theorem  7 ) ) .",

    "* lemma  3 ) says that every concave function from the class @xmath36 belongs to all the classes @xmath48 . for the proof of theorem  [ t : inf - fm ]",
    "we need the converse assertion , which turns out to be true even with the concavity assumption dropped .",
    "[ l : convl3 ] if @xmath81 for all @xmath47 , then @xmath43 .",
    "clearly , every convex function lies in the class @xmath33 .",
    "the last result of our paper shows that all `` sufficiently flat '' _ concave _ functions also lie in @xmath33 ; this complements in a sense theorem  [ t : max - f ] which implies that every concave function from the class @xmath33 is `` flat '' .",

    "as lemma  [ l : redend ] shows , it suffices to establish with @xmath74 and @xmath97 .",

    "it remains to prove lemma  [ l : redend ] .",
    "the proof uses the well - known fact that a strictly concave function is unimodal ; the specific version we need here is that if @xmath3 is continuous and strictly concave on the closed interval @xmath130 $ ] , then either it is strictly monotonic on @xmath130 $ ] , or there exists @xmath131 such that @xmath3 is strictly increasing on @xmath132 $ ] and strictly decreasing on @xmath133 $ ] . as a result , the minimum of a function , strictly concave on a closed interval , is attained at one of the endpoints of the interval .",
