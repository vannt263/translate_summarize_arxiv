    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of bl lac objects is dominated by non - thermal emission from a relativistic jet oriented close to the line of sight .",
    "it is characterised by two peaks , where the first lies in the ir to soft x - ray range and is thought to be due to synchrotron radiation .",
    "the second peak is in the @xmath1-ray range and most likely due to inverse ",
    "compton radiation .",
    "it is well established that bl lac objects detected in radio surveys ( rbls ) show markedly different properties compared to bl lacs detected in x - ray surveys ( xbls ) . in general , the latter are less extreme in terms of variability , polarization , superluminal motion and luminosity . also , rbls show stronger optical emission lines than xbls and most of the bl lac objects detected in @xmath1rays belong to the rbl class .",
    "the unification of rbls and xbls is still a matter of debate .",
    "the angle between the relativistic jet and the line of sight is certainly an important parameter ( e.g. celotti et al .",
    "1993 ) , but it has been shown ( e.g. sambruna et al . 1996 ) that orientation alone can not explain the large differences in the spectral energy distribution of the two classes . a second parameter could for example be the jet kinetic luminosity ( georgantopoulos & marscher 1998 ) or the frequency of the synchrotron peak ( e.g. padovani & giommi 1995 ) . the latter suggestion has led to a re - classification of bl lacs into hbls and lbls , i.e. high and low  frequency peaked bl lac objects , where most of the xbls and rbls belong to the hbl and lbl class , respectively .",
    "selection effects , caused by the high flux limits of previous samples ( e.g. 1-jy sample , emss sample ) , clearly are important and might explain much of the apparent dichotomy of bl lac objects .",
    "therefore it is desirable to establish new , large and complete samples of bl lac objects with deeper flux limits . in particular , the properties of intermediate bl lacs ( ibls ) ,",
    "i.e. those which fill the gap between lbls and hbls , play an important role for bl lac unification theories .",
    "recently , a new large sample of bl lac objects has become available ( cf .",
    "laurent - muehleisen et al . , this volume ) .",
    "it is a subsample of the so - called rgb sample , which resulted from the cross - correlation of the rosat all - sky survey and the 87 gb 5ghz radio survey .",
    "after accurate radio positions were obtained by vla observations of more than 1900 sources of this sample ( laurent - muehleisen et al .",
    "1997 ) , the optical identification of a properly selected subgroup resulted in more than 50 new bl lacs , adding to the about 100 previously known bl lac objects contained in the rgb sample .    the distribution in @xmath0 , the spectral index between 5ghz and 1 kev , is shown in fig .  1 for the rgb bl lacs . for comparison the distributions for the 1-jy and the emss sample",
    "are also shown .",
    "clearly , there is a continuous distribution in @xmath0 and the gap between hbls and lbls is filled with a number of objects .",
    "there are 22 bl lacs with 0.7@xmath20.8 , which constitute our sample of intermediate bl lac objects .    fig .",
    "2 shows the soft x - ray photon index @xmath3 in the 0.12.4 kev energy band as a function of the peak frequency of the synchrotron component @xmath4 .",
    "the peak frequencies were simply determined by parabolic fits to the radio , optical and x - ray fluxes .",
    "the photon indices for lbls and hbls were taken from urry et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and perlman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , whereas the @xmath3 values for the ibls were derived from hardness ratios . only datapoints with @xmath5 are shown .",
    "as already noted by padovani & giommi ( 1996 ) , lbls follow a positive and hbls a negative correlation in this diagram , which is nicely explained within the two component emission model . in this scenario ,",
    "ibls are expected to show intermediate peak frequencies ( in the optical ) and rather steep soft x - ray spectra .",
    "indeed , the average peak frequency for ibls is @xmath6 , compared to @xmath7 and @xmath8 for lbls and hbls , respectively .",
    "also the photon indices for the ibl sample are consistent with the two component model and a continuous distribution of synchrotron peak frequencies .",
    "a representation of the asca spectrum of the ibl 1424 + 2401 is shown in fig .",
    "3 . this source was originally considered to be a white dwarf , but was re - classified as a bl lac by impey & tapia ( 1988 ) and fleming ( 1993 ) .",
    "the ratio of data to model , where the model is a simple power law fit between 2 and 5 kev , indicates a curved spectrum , i.e. a flattening at the low and the high energy end . a model with two energy breaks around 1 and 5 kev significantly improves the fit .",
    "the flattening towards higher energies might be interpreted in terms of a flat inverse  compton component that starts to dominate the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the flux deficit at lower energies can not be due to absorption , since the necessary n@xmath9 values would be inconsistent with the rosat pspc spectrum .",
    "the spectral energy distribution sed of 1424 + 2401 is compared to mrk501 and oj287 in fig .  4 .",
    "the latter represent typical hbls and lbls , respectively .",
    "the vertical bars denote the peak frequencies of a third - order polynomial fit to the datapoints ( dashed lines ) and the open triangles represent the rosat pspc spectrum of 1424 + 2401 .",
    "the peak frequency and the very steep x - ray spectrum confirm the intermediate nature of 1424 + 2401 and hence indicate a continuous distribution of peak frequencies in bl lac objects .",
    "1055 + 5644 is one of the newly identified bl lac objects from the rgb sample .",
    "the combined sax lecs / mecs data of 1055 + 5644 indicate a steep x - ray spectrum ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "no significant curvature is seen , apart from a marginal flattening in the spectrum above 5 kev in the mecs data . in this context",
    "we note that 1055 + 5644 is included in the third egret catalog ( hartmann et al . ,",
    "this volume ) .",
    "the sed of 1055 + 5644 is again typical for ibls , i.e. it shows a peak frequency in the optical / nir .",
    "the rgb sample for the first time allows to study the bulk properties of bl lac objects over a broad range of seds . in particular , a large number of intermediate bl lac objects ( ibls ) is contained in the sample .",
    "the statistical properties of this first sample of ibls are consistent with the hypothesis that the bl lac population can be described by a continuous distribution of synchrotron peak frequencies .",
    "the asca spectrum of 1424 + 2401 is steep and displays significant curvature . in particular , the flattening at energies @xmath115 kev points towards a flat ic component , which begins to dominate at these energies .",
    "the seds of both 1424 + 2401 and 1055 + 5644 confirm the intermediate nature of these bl lac objects .",
