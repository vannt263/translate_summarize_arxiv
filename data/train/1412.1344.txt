    "in the statistical analysis of spatial processes , modelling and estimating the spatial dependence structure is fundamental . it is used by prediction techniques like kriging or conditional simulations .",
    "its description is commonly carried out using statistical tools such as the variogram or covariogram calculated on the entire domain of interest and considered under the stationarity assumption , for reasons of parsimony or mathematical convenience .",
    "the complexity of the spatial component of the analyzed process is therefore limited .",
    "the assumption that the spatial dependence structure is translation invariant over the whole domain of interest may be appropriate , when the latter is small in size , when there is not enough data to justify the use of a complex model , or simply because there is no other reasonable alternative . although justified and leading to a reasonable analysis , this assumption is often inappropriate and unrealistic given certain spatial data collected in practice .",
    "non - stationarity can occur due to many factors , including specific landscape and topographic features of the region of interest or other localized effects .",
    "these local influences can be observed computing local variograms , whose characteristics may vary across the domain of observations . for this type of non - stationarity structures ,",
    "making spatial predictions using conventional stationary methods is not appropriate . indeed",
    ", applying stationary approaches in such cases would be liable to produce less accurate predictions , including an incorrect assessment of the estimation error@xcite .",
    "several approaches have been proposed to deal with non - stationarity through second order moments ( see @xcite , for a review ) .",
    "one of the most popular methods of introducing non - stationarity is the space deformation of @xcite and other @xcite .",
    "it consists in starting with a stationary random function , and then transforming the distance in some smooth way to construct a non - stationary random function .",
    "maximum likelihood and bayesian variants of this approach have been developed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite established some theoretical properties about uniqueness and richness of this class of non - stationary models .",
    "some adaptations have been proposed recently by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a fundamental limitation of all estimation methodologies presented so far is the fact that implementation requires multiple independent realizations of the random function in order to obtain an estimated sample covariance or variogram matrix .",
    "the idea of having several independent realizations of the natural field is unrealistic because there are not multiple parallel physical worlds . in practice ,",
    "the approach is feasible when a time series is collected at each location as this gives the necessary , albeit dependent , replications . in general , we would prefer to incorporate a temporal aspect in the modelling rather than attempting repairs ( e.g. , differencing and detrending ) to achieve approximatively independent realizations .",
    "however , many geostatistical applications involved only one measurement at each site or equivalently , only one realization of a random function . @xcite , @xcite are the first authors to address the estimation of space deformation model in the case of a single realization of a random function , obtained as the transformation of a gaussian and isotropic random function .",
    "they exhibit a methodology based on quasi - conformal mappings and approximate likelihood estimation of the local parameters that characterize the deformation derived from partitioning densely observed data into subregions and assuming independence of the random function across partitions .",
    "however , this approach has not been applied to real datasets and requires very dense data .    in this work ,",
    "we follow the pioneering work of @xcite , while freeing the strong assumption of replication and do not make any distributional assumptions . in addition , we take into account other shortcomings associated with this approach that are : the required property of the deformation to be bijective and the computational challenge to fit the model for moderate and large datasets .",
    "to do so , we propose an estimation procedure based on the inclusion of spatial constraints and the use of a set of representative points referred to as anchor points rather than all data points to find the deformation .",
    "the proposed method provides a non - parametric estimation of the deformation through a step by step approach : first a dissimilarity matrix is built by combining a non - parametric kernel variogram estimator and euclidean distance between two points in the geographical space , second the estimation of the deformation at anchor points is considered by weighted non - metric multi - dimensional scaling and finally the deformation is interpolated over the whole domain by thin - plate spline radial basis functions .",
    "the proposed method also provides a rational and automatic estimation of the spatial dependence structure in the deformed space .",
    "we illustrate our estimation procedure on two simulated examples and apply it to soil dataset .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec2 ] describes the space deformation model through its basic ingredients and main properties . in sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ]",
    ", we address the problem of estimating the non - stationary spatial dependence structure and how spatial predictions and conditional simulations should proceed .",
    "two simulated data in section [ sec5 ] and a real dataset in section [ sec6 ] are used to illustrate the performance of the new approach and its potential . finally , section [ sec7 ] outlines concluding remarks and further work .",
    "the main idea behind the space deformation approach is the euclidean embedding of a non - stationary random function into a new space of equal or greater dimension , where it can be easily described and modeled , that is to say where both stationarity and isotropy hold .",
    "let @xmath0 be a constant mean random function defined on a fixed continuous domain of interest @xmath1 of the euclidean space @xmath2 and reflecting the underlying studied phenomenon .",
    "we consider that @xmath3 is governed by the following model : @xmath4 which can be written equivalently : @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents a stationary and isotropic random function and @xmath7 represents a deterministic non - linear smooth bijective function of the @xmath1-space onto the @xmath8-space . in principle , we can allow @xmath9 , although most frequently @xmath10 . from now on , without loss of generality , we assume @xmath10 .    the model specification in leads to model the variogram of @xmath3 in the form : @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the euclidean norm in @xmath2 and @xmath13 the stationary and isotropic variogram of @xmath14 which depends only on the euclidean distance between locations in @xmath8-space .    the second order structure model obtained in leads to a valid variogram , i.e. conditionally non - positive definite @xcite .",
    "its validity is assessed by the following proposition inspired by @xcite and straightforward to establish ( see [ appendix1 ] ) .",
    "[ prop1 ] if @xmath15 is a valid variogram , then @xmath16 is a valid variogram on @xmath17 , for any function @xmath18 .",
    "it is then even possible to rely on a valid variogram in a different space , through a function linking the two spaces .",
    "consequently , instead of working on the support @xmath1 of the non - stationary random function @xmath3 , the variogram of @xmath3 is defined with respect to the latent space @xmath8 where stationarity and isotropy are assumed .",
    "any problem involving the observed random function @xmath3 is transposed by the deformation @xmath19 to the stationary and isotropic random function @xmath14 .",
    "standard geostatistical techniques , such as kriging and conditional simulations can be apply directly to the latter . the results obtained on @xmath14 will then transpose to @xmath3 by the inverse deformation @xmath20 .    as described by @xcite ,",
    "when @xmath13 is non - decreasing , the spatial deformation @xmath19 operates as follows : the deformation effectively stretches the @xmath1-space in regions of relatively lower spatial correlation , while contracting it in regions of relatively higher spatial correlation , so that a stationary and isotropic variogram can model the spatial dependence structure as a function of the distance in the @xmath8-space representation .",
    "it is also important to note that the spatial deformation model defined in is identifiable up to a scaling for @xmath13 and up to a homothetic euclidean motion for @xmath19 .",
    "all isometries and homotheties are observationally equivalent .",
    "this result is based on the following proposition equivalent to that established by @xcite for deformation based non - stationary spatial correlation model . the proof is given in [ appendix1 ] .",
    "[ prop2 ] if @xmath21 is a solution to ( [ eq3 ] ) , then for any regular square matrix @xmath22 and any vector @xmath23 , @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a solution as well .",
    "let @xmath27 be a @xmath28 vector of observations from a unique realization of the random function @xmath3 , associated to known locations @xmath29 . in the second order structure model defined in ( [ eq3 ] ) , the functions @xmath19 and @xmath13 are unknown and need therefore to be estimated .",
    "the estimation workflow involves four main steps .",
    "first , we define a non - stationary variogram non - parametric kernel estimator which serves as a dissimilarity measure between two points in the geographical space @xmath1 .",
    "second , we construct the deformed space @xmath8 using the procedure of weighted non - metric multi - dimensional scaling applied to a dissimilarity matrix built from the non - stationary variogram estimator .",
    "third , we estimate @xmath19 by interpolating between a configuration of points in the @xmath1-space and the estimations of their deformations in the @xmath8-space using the class of thin - plate spline radial basis functions .",
    "fourth , the estimation of @xmath13 is carried out by calculating the experimental variogram on transformed data in the deformed space @xmath8 and using a mixture of basic variogram models , providing wide flexibility to adapt to the observed structure .",
    "we begin with an estimate of the non - stationary variogram at arbitrary locations using a kernel weighted local average of squared increments .",
    "our proposal is to use the variogram cloud @xmath30 which is an unbiased estimator of @xmath31 @xcite as the input data for the non - parametric kernel estimator of the non - stationary variogram .",
    "an intuitive empirical estimator of the non - stationary variogram at any two locations is given by the non - parametric kernel estimator defined as follows : @xmath32    where @xmath33 is a kernel defined as : @xmath34 , with @xmath35 a non - negative , symmetric kernel on @xmath36 with bandwidth @xmath37 .",
    "the expression defines the spatial dissimilarity between two arbitrary points in the geographical space @xmath1 .",
    "the purpose of the kernel function is to weight observations with respect to a reference point so that nearby observations get more weight while remote sites receive less .",
    "the denominator of is a standardization factor that ensures @xmath38 is unbiased when the expectation of the squared difference between the observations is spatially constant .",
    "if several realizations are available , we can simply take the average of over the different realizations .",
    "regarding the kernel @xmath35 defined in , his choice is less important than the choice of its bandwidth parameter @xmath39 , a reasonable choice of @xmath35 will generally lead to reasonable results @xcite .",
    "we use the quadratic kernel ( epanechnikov kernel ) which is an isotropic kernel with compact support , showing optimality properties in density estimation @xcite .",
    "indeed , the computational cost of is greatly reduced by using a compactly supported kernel , as it reduces the number of terms to compute .",
    "the selection of the bandwidth parameter @xmath39 is adresssed in section [ ssec4 ] .",
    "the transformation of the geographical space @xmath1 into the deformed space @xmath8 can be seen as the reallocation of a set of points in a euclidean space ( in a given dimensionality ) .",
    "the approach of non - metric multi - dimensional scaling ( nmds ) provides a solution to this problem @xcite .",
    "the aim is to find a representation of points in a given dimension space , such that the ordering of the euclidean distances between points matches exactly the ordering of the dissimilarities .",
    "till now , the fitting of a space deformation model based on nmds procedure is a challenging numerical problem where the dimensionality is roughly proportional to the number of observations . a sample of size @xmath40 requires a @xmath41 dissimilarity matrix to be stored and a @xmath42 matrix of coordinates to be inferred .",
    "the search of the deformed space based on this dissimilarity matrix requires considerable computing time even when @xmath40 is moderately large . to reduce the computational burden ,",
    "we can avoid mapping directly all data locations .",
    "indeed , spatial dissimilarities calculated between pairs of close points can be unnecessary and redundant because of their high correlation .",
    "the idea consists in obtaining the deformed space using only a representative set of @xmath43 points referred to as anchor points over the geographical space @xmath1 .",
    "these will be rather mapped with nmds .",
    "interpolating the anchor points in the @xmath1-space and the estimations of their deformations in the @xmath8-space , produces an estimate @xmath44 of the deformation function .",
    "then , the location of all sampling data points in the deformed space is obtained through @xmath44 .",
    "representative points may be chosen as a sparse grid over the domain or a subset of data points .",
    "they allow to reduce the computation time and to give reliable results for the nmds task .",
    "the sampling density which may be vary over the domain , can be accounted by non - uniform distribution of the anchor points .",
    "we consider a set of @xmath45 @xmath46-dimensional anchor points @xmath47}^t$ ] of the geographical space @xmath1 . the non - stationary variogram estimator @xmath48 defined in and calculated for each pair of anchor points allows to build a @xmath49 symmetric dissimilarity matrix @xmath50 $ ] , with @xmath51 .",
    "the specification of the dissimilarity matrix is required for the nmds procedure .",
    "the latter is usually applied in the absence of the euclidean coordinates of the points which produce the dissimilarities . however , in our context , the points of the original space @xmath1 are already identifiable by their euclidean coordinates , hence the necessity to ensure the spatial consistency of the transformation .",
    "moreover , @xmath48 reflects the local spatial dissimilarity , that is to say , for close pairs .",
    "indeed , this estimator can be quite accurate for short and moderate distances , as in the stationary framework , but very imprecise , although well defined , for large distances .",
    "it is therefore necessary to penalize the importance given to large distances compared to short distances in the search of the deformation .",
    "therefore , given the distance matrix associated with support points @xmath52 , we build a composite @xmath49 dissimilarity matrix @xmath53 $ ] : @xmath54 \\ \\mbox{and } \\mathbf{\\tilde{d}}=[\\tilde{d}_{ij}],\\ ] ] where @xmath55 represents the scaled ( transformed to the interval [ 0,1 ] ) non - stationary variogram estimator at locations @xmath56 and @xmath57 ; @xmath58 is the scaled euclidean distance between @xmath56 and @xmath57 ; @xmath59 $ ] is a mixing parameter .",
    "the composite dissimilarity matrix @xmath60 is a linear combination of a scaled dissimilarity matrix and a distance matrix .",
    "the idea is to build a hybrid spatial dissimilarity measure which takes into account both the dissimilarities observed in the regionalized variable and the spatial proximity to ensure that the deformation function does not fold , i.e. is bijective .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath61 controls the non - folding .",
    "the setting of @xmath61 is adressed in section [ ssec4 ] .      given the @xmath49 symmetric matrix @xmath53 $ ] of dissimilarities between the set of @xmath45 @xmath46-dimensional anchor points @xmath47}^t$ ] ,",
    "the objective is to represent @xmath52 as a configuration of @xmath62-dimensional points @xmath63}^t$ ] such that the following relations are satisfied as much as possible :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is a monotonic function that preserves the rank order of the dissimilarities .    in other words ,",
    "given the @xmath66 dissimilarities , we look for a representation of the anchor points in a given dimension space , so that the rank order of the configuration distances accord with the rank order of the dissimilarities .",
    "the representation of anchor points @xmath67 in the deformed space @xmath8 is determined such that the distances between these points in the @xmath8-space minimize the loss function defined by a _",
    "measure : @xmath68}^2}{\\sum_{i < j}{p_{ij}(\\lambda)h_{ij}^2(\\mathbf{u})}}}\\right]}^\\frac{1}{2},\\ ] ] where the minimization is performed over all monotonic functions @xmath65 and @xmath69 , for @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath33 is the kernel function used in the computing of the non - stationary variogram estimator @xmath71 defined in .",
    "the estimator @xmath72 represents the weighted least squares monotonic regression of the @xmath73 on the @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75 are non - negative dissimilarity weights used to weight the contribution of the corresponding elements of the dissimilarity matrix @xmath60 in computing and minimizing _ stress_. we introduce such a weighting scheme to take into account the fact that local information available in the neighborhood of anchor points may fluctuate from one anchor point pair to another . hence highly reliable dissimilarities have more impact in the loss function than unreliable ones . such weights also allow to emphasize dissimalirities at short distances .",
    "the _ stress _ provides a measure of the degree to which the rank order of the configuration distances concurs with the rank order of the dissimilarities to be mapped .",
    "it is invariant by translation , rotation or rescaling of the configuration .",

    ", we are interested in the estimation of the functional parameters @xmath19 and @xmath13 which govern the second order structure model . the transformation of anchor points is extended to a smooth function @xmath76 over the entire geographical space @xmath1 , using the class of thin - plate spline radial basis functions . using the estimated deformation @xmath76",
    ", an isotropic stationary variogram model is adjusted to the empirical variogram in the deformed space .",
    "finally , the estimated deformation function , in conjunction with the estimated isotropic stationary variogram model , are used to provide estimates of the spatial dependency between any two locations in the geographical space @xmath1 .",
    "we want to know the mapping of any point @xmath77 in the deformed space @xmath8 , as well as that in @xmath1 of any point @xmath78 . especially , a representation of all data points in the deformed space @xmath8 is required .",
    "given the configuration of anchor points @xmath52 and the estimation of their deformation @xmath67 , we seek a @xmath62-variate function @xmath79 that satisfies the interpolation condition @xmath80 .",
    "while a wide range of options exist , we follow @xcite in using the class of thin - plate spline radial basis functions to estimate @xmath19 .",
    "specifically , the thin - plate spline estimator of @xmath19 takes the following form @xcite : @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 are the anchor points seen as the centers of the radial basis function @xmath84",
    ".    the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the expression ( [ eq8 ] ) are unknown and therefore have to be determined .",
    "this is achieved by resolving the system of equations @xmath87 under the constraints @xmath88 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the performance of the spatial deformation approach also depends on its ability to properly adjust an isotropic stationary variogram model in the deformed space .",
    "thus , the modelling and estimating of the spatial dependence structure that characterizes the spatial behavior of the variable of interest is a key step .",
    "so far , highlighted by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , no rational choice has been developed yet for the isotropic stationary variogram model in the spatial deformation model . this choice is often made by visual inspection .    here , the estimation of @xmath13 in the deformed space @xmath8 is carried out using a mixture of basic variogram models ( nugget effect , gaussian , exponential , spherical ,  ) thereby enriching the set of theoretical variograms and offering wide flexibility to match the observed structure : @xmath89 where @xmath90 are basic valid isotropic stationary variogram structures and @xmath91 positive real numbers .",
    "to estimate @xmath13 , the isotropic stationary variogram model in the deformed space @xmath8 , we use a robust method recently developed by @xcite .",
    "it consists in automatically finding a model that fits the experimental variogram . from a linear combination of some authorized basic structures a numerical algorithm",
    "is used to estimate a parsimonious model that minimizes a weighted distance between the model and the experimental variogram .",
    "the proposed approach relies on two hyper - parameters @xmath92 used in the computation of the composite dissimilarity matrix @xmath60 .",
    "the method used to select these hyper - parameters is data driven .",
    "we combine two forms of cross - validation to select their optimal value .",
    "the first form is the cross validation based on @xmath48 .",
    "it consists of computing the cross - validation variogram error criterion over a grid of bandwidth values to determine a small set of bandwidths with low scores : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the non - stationary variogram estimator at locations @xmath95 and @xmath96 computed with all observations except @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath30 is an unbiased estimator of @xmath31 .    because the estimation of the spatial dependence structure is rarely a goal per se but an intermediate step before kriging , we want to choose the hyper - parameters that give the best cross - validation mean square error ( mse ) .",
    "more explicitly , for each pair of hyper - parameters @xmath92 , we compute the leave - one - out cross - validation score : @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes the spatial predictor computed at location @xmath95 using all observations except @xmath100 .",
    "the prediction method is described in detail in section [ ssec5 ] .",
    "the first form of cross - validation ( [ eq11 ] ) allows to select a small grid of bandwidth values which are used in the second form of cross - validation ( [ eq12 ] ) to search the optimal values of @xmath92 .",
    "thus , the first coarse bandwidth search reduces computational burden of the second step .",
    "this selection of hyper - parameters is illustrated with some examples in sections [ sec5 ] and [ sec6 ] .",
    "the main purposes of modelling and estimating the spatial dependence structure is to spatially interpolate data and perform simulations .",
    "we focus here on the description of the kriging and conditional simulations with the spatial deformation model .",
    "the estimation of the space deformation model can be used in kriging - type estimation equations to provide more reliable spatial estimates and prediction standard errors than those based on an inadequate stationary variogram structure .    given observations @xmath101 at @xmath102 ,",
    "the point predictor for the unknown value of @xmath3 at unsampled location @xmath103 is given by the ordinary kriging estimator : @xmath104 which minimizes the mean square error @xmath105 under the constraint@xmath106 @xmath107 .",
    "@xmath108 represents the transformed points .",
    "the prediction problem of the non - stationary random function @xmath3 is then transposed to the isotropic stationary random function @xmath14 .",
    "then , the kriging weights @xmath109 are calculated by solving the well known ordinary kriging system @xcite in the stationary framework .",
    "thus , using the space deformation approach to estimate the regionalized variable on target grid points , we can proceed as follows :    1 .",
    "obtain the image of the target grid points and data points through @xmath110 ; 2 .",

    "obtain the kriging on the target grid points by simple correspondence .",
    "there are a number of situations where conventional prediction techniques like kriging not properly fulfill their objectives .",
    "this is when it comes to integrating data , to predict quantities such as extrema or quantiles .",
    "an attractive approach to form consistent estimators of any entity of interest or quantifying uncertainties is through conditional simulations of the random function .    here , the goal is to simulate a realization @xmath112 of a gaussian random function @xmath3 with constant mean @xmath45 and second order structure model : @xmath113 , with respect to the data @xmath114 .",

    "additionally , the non - stationary approach leads to better prediction than the stationary model as measured by predictive scores .",
    "one advantage of the proposed approach is that instead of finding the deformation using all data points , we can do it with a reduced number of points , compared to existing methods .",
    "this is a major improvement for large datasets .",
    "indeed , the use of anchor points makes it possible to run the nmds step even for very large datasets .",
    "moreover , the approach incorporates spatial constraints which guarantee the bijection property of the deformation .",
    "this point was actually a major drawback while trying to fit a deformation function .",
    "the proposed approach is easy to implement and allows to use all developments already made in the stationary framework through the deformation .",
