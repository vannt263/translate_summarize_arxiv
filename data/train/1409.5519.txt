    "the past few years have witnessed an extensive theoretical development in the area of cooperative control of multi - agent systems .",
    "this area of control engineering has attracted significant attention from various scientific communities ranging from mathematics to electronic engineering @xcite .",
    "much of this attention owes to applications in the fields of unmanned air vehicles ( uavs ) , smart grids , large - scale sensor networks , to name a few @xcite .",
    "one of the central problems in cooperative control of multi - agent systems , the so called consensus problem @xcite , is concerned with the design of local controllers using relative information to realize a state agreement in the whole group . to date , much progress has been made in the study of consensus in multi - agent systems .",
    "for example , consensus for first - order multi - agent systems with switching directed topologies has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the state of consensus in such multi - agent systems can be achieved if and only if the time - varying network topology jointly contains a directed spanning tree .",
    "however , a large class of practical agents requires higher order dynamical models to describe dynamics of such systems @xcite .",
    "motivated by this observation , consensus problems for second - order multi - agent systems and integrator - type higher - order multi - agent systems have been studied in @xcite .",
    "more recently , the consensus problem for general linear multi - agent systems has received a lot of attention @xcite-@xcite .",
    "specifically , the consensus problem for linear multi - agent systems under a fixed directed communication topology has been addressed in @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the robust consensus of linear multi - agent systems with additive perturbations of the transfer matrices of the nominal dynamics was studied . in  @xcite and a number of subsequent papers ,",
    "the robust consensus was analyzed from the view point of the @xmath0 control theory . among other relevant references , we mention @xcite and @xcite where , while assuming that the open loop systems are lyapunov stable , the consensus problems for linear multi - agent systems with undirected and directed switching topologies have been investigated , respectively .",
    "in the situation where the multi - agent system is equipped with a leader and the topology of the system belongs to the class of switched directed topologies , the consensus tracking problem has been studied in @xcite .",
    "one feature of the results in these references is that the open loop agents systems were not required to be lyapunov stable .",
    "note that the presence of the leader in the multi - agent systems considered in these reference facilitated the derivation and a direct analysis of the consensus error system .",
    "however , when the open loop systems are not lyapunov stable and/or there is no designated leader in the group , the consensus problem for linear multi - agent systems with switching directed topologies remains challenging .",
    "motivated by the above discussion , this paper aims to study the consensus problem for linear multi - agent systems with switching directed topologies .",
    "several aspects of our study are worth mentioning .",
    "firstly , we dispense with some of the assumptions in the existing work . e.g. , the open loop dynamics of the agents are not required to be lyapunov stable in the present paper .",
    "furthermore , the multi - agent systems under consideration are not required to have a leader .",
    "compared to consensus problems for linear multi - agent systems that have a designated leader , the point of difference here concerns the assumption on the communication topology of the system . in the previous work on the linear leader - tracking multi - agent consensus such as , e.g. , @xcite , each possible augmented system graph was required to contain a directed spanning tree rooted at the leader .",
    "compared to that work , the switching topologies in the present paper are allowed to have spanning trees rooted at different nodes .",
    "this is a significant relaxation of the existing conditions since it enables the system to be reconfigured if necessary ( e.g. , to allow different nodes to serve as the formation leader ) .",
    "this also has a potential to make the system more reliable .",
    "the analysis of leaderless tracking consensus in this paper proceeds as follows . by introducing a linear transformation , the consensus problem for the leaderless multi - agent system under consideration",
    "is first converted to the global uniform asymptotic stability analysis problem for a class of switched linear systems with zero equilibrium .",
    "it is worth noting that the transformation technique employed in this paper is different from those used in @xcite where the consensus problem was converted to the global asymptotic stability problem over a time - varying manifold .",
    "then , by constructing multiple lyapunov functions , sufficient conditions are derived for the system under consideration to achieve consensus .",
    "similar to @xcite , our results impose a condition on the minimum dwell time of the network , i.e. , the minimum time the system must spend in a particular configuration . recall that the conditions in @xcite provide a lower bound on the dwell time which ensures that consensus in a multi - agent system of coupled double integrators with switching topology is achieved if each possible topology contains a directed spanning tree .",
    "however , the analysis method given in @xcite is inapplicable to general linear multi - agent systems since one can not directly calculate the divergence behavior of general linear multi - agent systems .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , some preliminaries from the graph theory and the problem formulation are given . in section iii ,",
    "the main theoretical results are presented .",
    "a numerical example is provided in section iv for illustration .",

    "thus , to show that the multi - agent system ( [ closedloopmas ] ) achieves consensus it is sufficient to establish that the zero equilibrium point of the switched system ( [ closdloopconsensuserrorrewritten ] ) is globally asymptotically stable .    according to assumption [ assumptiontopology ]",
