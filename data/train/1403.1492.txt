    "the self - assembly of large triangular molecules attracts nowadays a great deal of attention ( see e.g. reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "the trimesic acid ( tma )  @xcite , btb  @xcite and some other molecules  @xcite create patterns of different complexity on solid - liquid interface or high - quality graphite and metal surfaces in ultra vacuum conditions .",
    "the assemblies of such molecules might be different , but the , so - called , honeycomb phase is the dominating low temperature pattern .    for description of the ordering of such ( or similar ) molecules the statistical models of phase transitions might be used .",
    "the honeycomb phase might be understood then as the low - temperature long - range order ( lro ) phase on a tripartite lattice in which the sites of each sublattice are occupied by occupation variables @xmath13 , @xmath14 and 0 , respectively .",
    "for example , the ordering of triangular tma molecules might be described by the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) nearest neighbor ( 1nn ) 3-state model  @xcite which was originally created to describe the ordering of lattice fluids and is sometimes called bell - lavis model  @xcite .",
    "this model is similar to a better known triangular afm lattice models : blume - capel ( bc ) model  @xcite with some neglected interactions , blume - emery - griffiths model  @xcite with anisotropic term  @xcite and diluted triangular afm ising ( tafi ) model  @xcite .",
    "the ordering of large molecules requires accounting for a finite size of the ordering objects , therefore some modifications related to hard core exclusions have to be introduced . to describe the ordering of tma molecules into a series of flower phases , a model  @xcite with such exclusion at 1nn",
    "was proposed . in this model",
    "the initial lattice is rescaled , and the molecular interactions , which mimic the h - bonds , act between the molecules being on third nearest neighbor ( 3nn ) sites , while the exclusion mimic the hard core infinite repulsive interaction occurring due to finite size of the molecules .",
    "at least two important questions arise when triangular afm and other lattice models are used ( see e.g.  @xcite ) to descibe the molecular ordering : to what extent the standard models might be rescaled and what effect the exclusion brings in comparison with classical ( i.e. usually 1nn ) statistical models .",
    "intuitively , it is clear that the rescaling to the nnn models ( with n@xmath15 ) changes the entropy of the system repressing the ordered phases and decreasing the phase transition temperature if more sites for molecular diffusion occur . on the other hand ,",
    "the exclusion , which necessarily comes due to large size of the molecules , decreases the number of sites for diffusion and , while promoting the ordered phases , increases the transition temperature .",
    "here we try to answer these questions using a triangular afm bc model with exclusions as an example .",
    "this model is tightly related to tafi model which was extensively studied  @xcite due to its frustrated phase and large entropy at @xmath16 .",
    "the tafi model with magnetic field ( chemical potential ) gives rise to ordered 3-sublattice structure , denoted as @xmath17 , in which magnetizations ( densities ) of two sublattices are mutually equal but different from that of the third  @xcite .",
    "when diluted by the vacancies , which are not fixed , but evolve together with the spins ( the , so - called , annealed vacancies ) , the tafi model also allows for the 3-sublattice lro structure .",
    "simple substitution of occupation variables  @xcite transforms a diluted tafi model in a field to ising spin-1 or bc model  @xcite .",
    "the tafi model also can be mapped into 6-state afm clock model  @xcite .",
    "as shown by cardy  @xcite , the 6-state clock model can exhibit either a first - order transition , two berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type transitions or successive ising , three - state potts , or ashkin - teller - like transitions .",
    "with decrease of temperature the 6-state afm clock model on triangular lattice gives a succession of two very close phase transitions which are attributed to ising ( chiral ) and bkt - type respectively  @xcite .",
    "the earliest study  @xcite of triangular afm bc model performed by renormalization group methods demonstrated that the afm lro phase , which has the sites of its three sublattices occupied by variables 1 , -1 and 0 respectively , can be obtained on a phase diagram of this model .",
    "this phase occurs when the ratio of a single ion anisotropy parameter normalized to antiferromagnetic coupling , @xmath18 , is within limits 0 and 3/2 .",
    "when @xmath19 the gas ( disordered ) phase prevails .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the phase transitions to the lro phase are of the second order for all @xmath20 , except at the very limit of the lro phase , @xmath21 , where the first order phase transition was found .",
    "overstepping other limit of the lro phase , i. e. at @xmath22 , the frustrated phase typical to the tafi model occurs .",
    "it should be noted that treating the model spin variables as particle variables and using the lattice - gas rather than the magnetic formalism , the single ion anisotropy parameter @xmath0 might be understood as a chemical potential",
    ". then decrease of @xmath0 is associated with increase of particle concentration at expense of vacancies and transition from the 3-state afm bc model to the 2-state tafi model ( no vacancies ) at @xmath23 .",
    "recently , a consistent study of phase transitions of this model was performed using monte carlo ( mc ) calculations  @xcite .",
    "it was clearly shown that the phase transition from the paramagnetic to the afm lro phase is mediated by the bkt - type phase in all interval of @xmath20 values , where the lro afm phase exists , except for @xmath24 , where the first order phase transition between paramagnetic and lro afm phases is found .",
    "in this paper we study the afm bc model with exclusions .",
    "the problem is solved assuming the afm interaction of spins residing on 3nn sites .",
    "two models with hard core exclusions are considered : the 3nn model with exclusions at the 1nn sites ( 3nn1 ) and the 3nn model with 1nn and 2nn exclusions ( 3nn12 ) ( see fig .",
    "it should be noted that 3nn afm bc model without exclusions is not studied here , because it gives entirely different type of lro afm phase as its ground state structure .",
    "the obtained results for 3nn1 and 3nn12 models are compared with the results of the 1nn model .",
    "we study how the exclusion affects the type of phase transition , critical line of the bkt points and phase diagram .",
    "we demonstrate that in both 3nn models with exclusion the bkt - type phase transitions obtained in 1nn model survive . nevertheless , the phase transitions in the 3nn1 and 3nn12 models are similar to those of the 1nn model only at lower temperature , where the transition from the bkt - type phase to the lro afm phase is found , and at those values of a single - ion anisotropy parameter which are not close to the gas phase limit . at higher temperature and close to this limit",
    "the properties are rather different .",
    "the exclusions decrease the high - temperature point of the bkt - type phase transition and might stimulate the occurrence of a phase transition from paramagnetic phase to the phase with domains of the lro afm phase .",
    "it is demonstrated in the last section of the paper that the higher temperature part of the phase diagrams of both 3nn models is very different from that of the 1nn model .",
    "the model hamiltonian has the form    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the spin variable on the triangular lattice site @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the antiferromagnetic ( @xmath29 ) interaction parameter acting between the particles at 3nn sites , and @xmath30 is a single - ion anisotropy parameter . here",
    "we regard the introduced variables as describing the magnetic particles in the diluted lattice - gas model rather than the spin projections . therefore in ( 1 )",
    "we write @xmath30 with plus sign and treat this parameter as a chemical potential , i.e. the total concentration of @xmath31 particles increases ( decreases ) with decrease ( increase ) of @xmath30 . consequently , in the 3nn12 model the interactions between particles separated by 1nn and 2nn distances are forbidden by taking infinite repulsion of particles at these sites . in the 3nn1 model",
    "the interactions between particles in the 1nn sites are forbidden in the same way .",
    "further , the temperature and single - ion anisotropy parameter are both normalized to @xmath32 : @xmath33 and @xmath18 .    since cluster algorithms for frustrated systems",
    "are known to be ineffective  @xcite , we performed the simulation of phase transition properties using local update ( single - flip ) metropolis algorithm and glauber dynamics . in the beginning the sites of a triangular lattice were randomly populated by particles in states + 1 , 1 and 0 , and the initial energy @xmath34 of a randomly chosen molecule was calculated .",
    "then the initial state of that molecule was changed ( with equal probability ) to one of two remaining states , and the final energy @xmath35 was calculated .",
    "the new state was accepted , if the energy decreased after the change of state , or accepted with the probability @xmath36 $ ] , if increased .",
    "thus , the calculations were performed with fixed chemical potential , while the concentration of particles in non - zero state , @xmath37 , was allowed to vary .    for thermal averaging mc calculations and finite size",
    "scaling ( fss ) of both 3nn models with exclusions we used the triangular lattices of sizes @xmath38 with @xmath39 from 96 up to 216 . for calculations of the 1nn model , which we performed to compare the results ,",
    "the lattice sizes @xmath40 , 72 , 96 , 120 were used ( for 1nn model @xmath28 in ( 1 ) is acting between the particles on the 1nn sites ) .",
    "we used periodic boundary conditions and @xmath41 mc steps ( mcs ) for thermalization .",
    "further , we collected averages of 10@xmath42 mcs for the 3nn models and 10@xmath43 - 10@xmath42 mcs for the 1nn model .",
    "our simulations were performed starting from higher temperature and using random initial particle configuration .",
    "then the temperature was gradually decreased in small steps with simulations at new temperature starting from the final configuration of the previous temperature .    since phase transition parameters in this system",
    "were often characterized by abruptness of their thermodynamic parameters and first order phase transitions , in particular , we performed also energy histogram calculations using reweighting techniques  @xcite . for these calculations we used slightly larger lattice sizes ( @xmath44 ) than for the thermal averaging . in some cases we used a very large lattice size , @xmath45 and 399 .",
    "our simulations of thermodynamic parameters ( energy derivatives ) often proceeded as follows : the phase transition point was located by thermal averaging and then its slight correction was performed by reweighting calculations .",
    "we also performed the analysis of the autocorrelation time of energy at @xmath1 at @xmath46 for both 3nn models .",
    "the integrated autocorrelation time for the 3nn12 model ranged from @xmath47 mcs for @xmath48 to @xmath49 mcs for @xmath50 . for the 3nn1 model",
    "this time is around one - two orders of magnitude higher .    for studies of phase transitions we used the afm order parameter .",
    "it should be noted , that low temperature afm phase of the 1nn model is stabilized when each sublattice of the tripartite lattice is occupied by @xmath13 , @xmath14 and 0 variables , respectively .",
    "the distance between so - occupied sites is one lattice constant of a triangular lattice , @xmath51 .",
    "the stoichiometric particle concentration ( coverage of sites occupied by the @xmath31 particles ) in the 1nn model is @xmath52",
    ". low temperature afm phase of both 3nn models has 12 sublattices , only two of which are occupied by the @xmath13 and @xmath14 particles , respectively , and all other sublattices are empty .",
    "therefore the distance between @xmath13 and @xmath14 particles is @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the afm phase of both 3nn models . as an order parameter",
    ", we use the staggered magnetization , a slightly reworked version of the one suggested for the 1nn model  @xcite .",
    "it is the average difference of maximally and minimally occupied sublattices .",
    "for 3nn model we had to account for occupancy of 12 sublattices , and therefore the staggered magnetization has the form    @xmath55    here @xmath56 denote sites belonging to each sublattice , and the factor 6 is needed to compensate for the stoichiometric concentration of the afm phase in the 3nn models .",
    "we calculate also temperature dependences of the specific heat @xmath57 , susceptibility @xmath58 , logarithmic derivatives of @xmath59 and @xmath60    @xmath61    and binder order parameter and energy cumulants , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively . the functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 were introduced in ref .",
    "they were shown  @xcite to be useful for a finite - size scaling of the 1nn afm bc model . at the second order phase transition point",
    "@xmath1 the maximum of specific heat and susceptibility scale as @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , while minimum of @xmath64 and @xmath65 - as @xmath68 .",
    "here @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are critical exponents of specific heat , susceptibility and correlation length , respectively . at the first order phase transition at @xmath1 the extrema of all these functions scale as",
    "@xmath72  @xcite , where @xmath73 is dimensionality of the system .    in a following section we present the values of critical exponent ratios @xmath74 and @xmath75 at the phase transition point from the paramagnetic phase , @xmath1 .",
    "the ratio @xmath74 is obtained either by combined thermal averaging and reweighted histogram calculation of specific heat maximum at @xmath1 or by scaling these values close to @xmath1 and using the formula @xmath76 ( here @xmath77 and background is assumed to be @xmath78 ) .",
    "the latter formula also gives the value of @xmath75 which we alternatively obtain as the average of scaling of parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    in a case of bkt - type phase transitions correlation length",
    "diverges as @xmath79^{-1/2}\\}$ ] and spin - correlation function decays as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the critical exponent of the correlation function  @xcite .",
    "the order parameter at the bkt - type of phase transition point scales as @xmath82 .",
    "the exponent @xmath81 might also be obtained from a part of susceptibility @xmath83  @xcite . to obtain accurate values of the bkt - type phase transitions of the afm bc 1nn model at @xmath3 and @xmath2 ,",

    "both 3nn12 and 3nn1 models , as well as the 1nn model , have the low - temperature afm phase at values of the single - ion anisotropy parameter @xmath0 in between 0 and 3/2 .",
    "the behaviour and properties of phase transitions are different for different values of @xmath0 . for the 3nn12 model we found three important ranges of @xmath0 values .",
    "the range i corresponds to the situation when there are three consecutive phase transitions : two of them are of the bkt - type ( @xmath3 and @xmath2 ) , and they frame the critical line of the bkt - type phase transitions , and the third is a high - temperature phase transition at @xmath1 . in range ii there remains the critical line of the bkt - type phase transition points , and @xmath3 as its low - temperature point , but @xmath90 .",

    "temperature dependence of staggered magnetization ( fig .",
    "2a ) demonstrates that 3nn12 model has three phase transitions at @xmath46 .",
    "in addition to two transitions at @xmath3 and @xmath2 ( which correspond to peaks of susceptibility in fig .",
    "2b ) , the high temperature phase transition at @xmath1 is nicely visible as a twist of @xmath93 dependence at very low values of @xmath98 . in temperature dependence of susceptibility , the @xmath1 might be noticed as a small higher - temperature shoulder of the peak at @xmath2 .",
    "however , the transition at @xmath1 corresponds to the main high - temperature peak in the @xmath95 dependence ( fig .",
    "2c , d ) , and here the transition at @xmath2 is its hardly discernible lower - temperature satellite ( fig . 2c ) .",
    "the transition at @xmath3 is very weakly @xmath39-dependent ( fig .",

    "analysis of log - log plots of magnetization vs @xmath39 ( fig.4a ) corroborates the finding of the 1nn model that the transitions at @xmath3 and @xmath2 belong to the bkt - type phase transitions .",
    "this is seen from the temperature dependence of the critical exponent of the correlation function , @xmath81 ( fig .",
    "4c ) , which for the bkt - type transitions should correspond to the doubled slope of lines in fig .",
    "4a . in temperature range between 0.35 and 0.55",
    "the parameter @xmath81 clearly demonstrates a plateau .",
    "the interval of @xmath81 values in the plateau roughly coincides with classical predictions for the critical line of the bkt - type phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "we performed the fss analysis using formula ( 4 ) to obtain more accurate values of transition temperatures @xmath3 and @xmath2 and @xmath81 .",
    "the results are shown in fig . 5a and",

    "the obtained value of @xmath3 is a bit higher than that at the peak of @xmath104 and very similar to that at the peak of @xmath105 , while @xmath2 lies lower than that obtained at the peak of @xmath105 .",
    "it should be also noted , that we expected some error in determination of the @xmath2 point , since in the 3nn12 model , differently from the 1nn model , the transition at @xmath2 is not from the paramagnetic phase , but from the structure existing between @xmath2 and @xmath1 ( see below ) .",

    "it should be also noted that the @xmath115 dependence ( fig .",
    "4c ) also `` feels '' the phase transition at @xmath1 demonstrating a sharp peak at the same value of temperature where the extrema of @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath104 are obtained .",
    "this is not unexpected : the point at @xmath1 is critical .",

    "we noticed that this transition occurs at approximately same concentration of particles as the stoichiometric concentration of the low - temperature lro afm phase ( see fig .",
    ". visual inspection of instant particle configuration reveals marked increase ( in comparison to the paramagnetic phase ) of hexagons with side length @xmath53 and alternation of + 1 and -1 variables on the vertices and 0 in the center , i.e. hexagons typical to the low-@xmath118 phase of the 3nn12 model .",
    "these domains of low - temperature phase exist in a very small interval of temperature between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    ".    different properties of phase transition at @xmath1 in ranges ii and iii , on one hand , and i , on the other , might be seen analyzing the energy histograms ( fig .",

    "it should be noted here that even the behavior in @xmath151 region is not so homogeneous as might be assumed from main fig .",
    "9b . the detailed inset in this fig . demonstrates that interface tension slightly increases when the limit of the tafi model , @xmath23 , is approached and therefore has some minimum around @xmath152 , the minimum which survives also for other values of @xmath39 .    rather similar result ,",
    "demonstrating the division into several ranges of behavior , is obtained analyzing the magnitude of minimum related to @xmath1 of both binder cumulants , @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "they have two very different regions of behavior : up to approximately @xmath155 the minimum of @xmath97 is around 0.3 - 0.1 , but drastically decreases for higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "the minimum of @xmath96 is rather close to the 2/3 limit up to @xmath46 , but again start to rather abruptly decrease at higher values of @xmath0 .    the results of our thermal averaging mc simulation in ranges ii and iii demonstrate that the thermodynamic parameters close to @xmath1 either show thin and high extrema ( @xmath104 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) or abruptness similar to jump ( @xmath84 and average energy ) , see e.g. the behavior of normalized coverage at @xmath149 in fig . 6 .",
    "thus , these results just confirm the results obtained by histogram calculations that the phase transitions in these two regions are of the first order .    in ranges ii and iii we also performed fss analysis and determined the ratios of critical exponents .",

    "@xmath185 these two models have notable differences : where the 1nn model demonstrates higher temperature paramagnetic - to - bkt - type phase transition at @xmath2 and lower temperature transition at @xmath3 , the 3nn12 model shows three transitions : ( i ) phase transition at @xmath1 from paramagnetic phase to the structure , which has the stoichiometry and separate domains of the lro afm phase , ( ii ) higher - temperature transition to the bkt - type phase at @xmath2 and ( iii ) lower temperature transition at @xmath3 .",
    "the difference in magnitude of @xmath2 occurs , because the 3nn12 model has higher entropy , i. e. larger number of free sites for hopping and higher probability of inhomogeneous distribution of particles into domains .",
    "therefore the frustrated phase in the 3nn12 model disorders at lower temperature than in the 1nn model .",
    "the occurrence of phase transition at @xmath1 is related to the fact that exclusions make the energy and other thermodynamic functions more abrupt at higher temperature , i.e. exclusions create inhomogeneous distribution of particles in disordered phase .",
    "thus , income of particles is hindered and their coverage @xmath119 is artificially maintained too small for that particular temperature ( in comparison to the 1nn model ) .",
    "decrease of temperature enhances afm correlations , and the `` normal '' coverage is recovered by sudden increase of @xmath119 .",
    "this might be seen e.g. in @xmath186 dependences in fig .",
    "6 or temperature dependences of internal energy which result in sharp peaks of @xmath104 at @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the `` semi - ordered '' afm phase has a chance to form in the 3nn12 model at a bit higher temperature than the frustrated phase occurs .",
    "the hump in @xmath186 dependence marks the region of frustrated phase between @xmath3 and @xmath2 . in this temperature range the center sites of the hexagons ( which are formed by alternating variables @xmath31 on the vertices )",
    "are partially filled .",
    "thus , in the 3nn12 model the preconditions ( relatively low temperature and stoichiometry corresponding to the afm phase ) allows for the afm domains - phase to occur just before the hump .",
    "higher concentration and correspondingly broader hump ( lower values of @xmath0 ) shift the @xmath1 value to higher temperature , while lower concentration ( @xmath187 ) make the hump small and @xmath188 .    , 0.7 , 0.9 , 1.15 and 1.3 .",
    "the results were obtained for lattice sizes @xmath94 ( both 3nn models ) and 48 ( 1nn model ) . ]",
    "the entropy of the 3nn1 model ( number of free sites for hopping ) is even higher than that of the 1nn or 3nn12 model .",
    "therefore the temperature of the phase transition from the paramagnetic phase for the 3nn1 model is the lowest of the three models .",
    "moreover , due to relative entropy increase , this phase transition occurs at such a temperature which lies in temperature limits of the line of the the bkt - type critical points of the 1nn model .",
    "therefore , contrary to the 1nn model , which has the line of critical bkt - type points between @xmath3 and @xmath2 , and the 3nn12 model , which ( at least in part of @xmath0 interval ) demonstrates three phase transitions ( @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 ) , the 3nn1 model shows reduced temperature interval of the bkt - type points line .",
    "the end point of this line at @xmath2 coincides with @xmath1 for all values of @xmath0 and , as shown by our analysis , most likely , does not belong to the bkt - type phase transitions .",
    "our analysis can not distinguish , whether the two transitions merge into one point or they are separate transitions at extremely close temperatures with @xmath189 , a well - known situation for transitions to frustrated systems  @xcite .",
    "note , that @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the 3nn12 model coincide only at narrow interval of @xmath7 ( compare abrupt behaviour of @xmath93 at this region of the 3nn12 model with that of the 3nn1 model in all interval of @xmath0 values , see fig .",

    ", we found that the histograms are two - peaked in all interval of @xmath0 values in both 3nn12 and 3nn1 models .",
    "however , the position of the saddle point in these histograms clearly depends on @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0-dependences of interface tension , latent heat and binder cumulants demonstrate that there are three ranges of behavior of phase transitions . in range iii the transition at @xmath91 is clearly of the first order .",
    "this is evidenced by two - peaked histograms with a saddle point which is either very deep or decreasing with increase of @xmath39 .",
    "the magnitudes of critical exponents @xmath74 and @xmath75 are around 2 .",
    "the histograms in intermediate range ii ( @xmath190 ) have higher saddle point than those in region iii , but it also decreases with increase of @xmath39 .",
    "this allows to attribute the transition in this range to the first order , too .",
    "however , in this range the finite size scaling at the @xmath1 point gives critical exponents different from ( though rather close to ) 2 .",
    "we could not present a definite answer about the type of the phase transition at @xmath1 in region i of the 3nn12 model ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "the histograms are two - peaked here , but the saddle point is rather high . extrapolation of the values of interface tension and latent heat at lattice sizes used in this paper shows that they approach finite limits at @xmath192 .",
    "rather controversial is the @xmath39-dependence of the order parameter which indicates that interpretation of the phase transition at @xmath1 in terms of critical exponents might be inconsistent .",
    "this would allow to attribute this transition to a `` weak '' first - order phase transitions observed in some diluted and frustrated systems  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we can not completely rule out the possibility of a second - order phase transition manifesting itself as vanishing of the latent heat at much larger lattices than used here .",
    "it should be noted that the 3nn12 model is a unique model in which the splitting of the higher temperature phase transition into two transitions , at @xmath1 and @xmath2 , occurs .",
    "in addition to this model , two other models with full exclusions up to interaction distance were also studied : the 5nn model with exclusions up to 4nn ( 5nn1234 ) and 6nn model with exclusions up to 5nn ( 6nn12345 ) . all models except 3nn12",
    "demonstrate one higher temperature phase transition at @xmath90 .",

    "the phase transitions from paramagnetic to fully frustrated ( ff ) phase in square @xmath193 ffxy model  @xcite proceed either through ( i ) ising and bkt phase transitions sequence with very close transition temperatures ( at small values of parameter @xmath194 similar to our @xmath0 ) , ( ii ) tricritical region ( intermediate values of @xmath194 ) featuring histograms with high saddle point or ( iii ) first order phase transitions ( high values of @xmath194 ) .",
    "here we studied strongly diluted lattices with small concentration of particles ( spins ) .",
    "such studies require huge computer resources and therefore might leave some questions not completely answered",
    ". however , the main tendencies are quite clear : exclusions do not affect the low temperature phase transition ; they make the high temperature phase transition more abrupt ; rescaling of lattice stimulate the entropic effects and decreases the high temperature phase transition temperature ; in a case of the 3nn12 model the formation of domains of low - temperature structure might reveal itself as a phase transition at high temperature .",
