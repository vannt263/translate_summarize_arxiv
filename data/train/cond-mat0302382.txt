    "high intensity beams of charged particles , in particular in linacs , have been proposed in recent years for a wide variety of accelerator  related applications : drivers for sources of neutron spallation ; production of tritium ; transmutation of radioactive wastes to species with shorter lifetimes ; heavy ion drivers for fusion - based production of thermonuclear energy ; production of radioactive isotopes for medical use , and so on . in all these cases",
    "it is very important to keep at a low level the beam losses to the wall of the beam pipe , since even small fractional losses in a high  current machine can cause exceedingly high levels of radioactivation .",
    "it is now widely believed that one of the relevant mechanisms for these losses is the formation of a low intensity halo relatively far from the core of the beam .",
    "these halos have been either directly observed @xcite or inferred from experiments @xcite , and have also been predicted from extensive numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "often in these studies the particle  core model has been used to understand the halo formation and its extent .",
    "that notwithstanding , it is widely believed that for the next generation of high intensity machines it is necessary to obtain a more quantitative understanding not only of the physics of the halo , but also of the beam transverse distribution in general @xcite .",
    "in fact `` because there is not a consensus about its definition , halo remains an imprecise term '' @xcite so that several proposals have been put forward for its description .",
    "charged particle beams are usually described in terms of classical deterministic dynamical systems .",
    "the standard model is that of a collisionless plasma where the corresponding dynamics is embodied in a suitable phase space ( see for example @xcite ) . generally speaking ,",
    "the beams are described in a comoving reference system so that we can confine ourselves to a non relativistic setting . in this framework",
    ", the formation of the halo has been studied mainly by means of the particle - core model initially proposed by gluckstern , and the simulations show that the dynamical instabilities due to a parametric resonance can allow ions to escape from the core @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we propose and develop a different approach .",
    "we introduce a model for the formation of the halo based on the idea that the trajectories of the charged particles are sample paths of a stochastic process , rather than the usual deterministic ( differentiable ) trajectories .",
    "a random collisional plasma described in terms of configurational stochastic processes seems a realistic model for the dynamics taking place in particle accelerators .",
    "moreover , it can explain the rare escape of particles from a quasi - stable beam core , since it takes into account , statistically , the complicated inter - particle interactions that can not be described in detail .",
    "of course , the idea of a stochastic approach is hardly new @xcite , but there are several different ways to implement it .",
    "the system we want to describe is the particle beam endowed with some measure of time - reversal invariance .",
    "for such a physical situation one is faced with a many - body dynamical system which is at the same time stochastic ( due to the random collisions and the fast , irregular configurational dynamics ) and conservative ( time - reversal invariant ) .",
    "one then needs a generalization of classical mechanics for conservative deterministic systems to a classical mechanics of conservative stochastic systems , i.e. a stochastic mechanics .    despite the rather widespread misconception that stochastic processes in dynamics are always associated to the description of dissipative and irreversible behaviors , it is in fact possible for specific stochastic dynamical systems to exhibit time - reversal invariance . in general",
    ", these systems are such that a deterministic dynamics in terms of known external potentials is ascribed to a system whose kinematics , due to some intrinsic irregularities , is instead stochastic @xcite .",
    "this is the case we conside for the collisional beam .    in previous papers",
    "@xcite we analysed some basic properties of stochastic mechanics ( sm ) and we also introduced some basic criteria of mechanical stability in order to provide phenomenological support to the scheme of sm for classical stochastic dynamical systems .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite we applied sm to the description of the dynamics of charged particle beams , and we showed how the criteria of mechanical stability allow to connect the ( transverse ) emittance to the characteristic microscopic scales of the system and to the total number of particles in a given beam .",
    "moreover , this method allows to implement techniques of active control for the dynamics of the beam . in ref .",
    "@xcite these techniques have been proposed to improve the beam focusing and to independently change the frequency of the betatron oscillations .    in the present paper , the sm of particle beams",
    "is used to investigate the nature , the size and the dynamical characteristics of beam halos . in particular , we determine the effects of the space ",
    "charge interaction on the formation of the halo by calculating the growth of the beam emittance , and by estimating the probability to find particles far away from the beam core .",
    "we then consider the reverse problem i.e. , by imposing reasonable forms of the stationary halo distributions we derive the effective spatial potentials that are associated to such distributions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sections [ nelsonism ] and [ control ] we summarize the results of previous papers on the model of sm for particle beams with special emphasis on the techniques of active control needed to engineer a desired beam dynamics .",
    "we then apply sm to study the formation of the beam halo . in section [ selfconsistent ]",
    "we show how to treat with sm the effects of space charge due to the electromagnetic interactions among the particles .",
    "we introduce and solve self - consistently a set of coupled , nonlinear hydrodynamic equations for the beam density and phase , the space - charge potentials , and the external electromagnetic field .",
    "solution of the coupled equations leads to the first main result of our paper , i.e. that the final transverse particle distribution is greatly broadened due to the presence of the space - charge potential .",
    "this broadening gives rise to a penetration of the distribution well into spatial regions very far from the core of the beam , thus realizing a type of continuous halo , i.e. without intermediate voids of particles ( nodes of the transverse beam distribution ) .",
    "this effect is reflected in a corresponding growth of the transverse emittance that we estimate from the solution of the self - consistent equations . in section [ halodistr ]",
    "we study the reverse problem : given different stationary transverse distributions of the halo around the core of the beam , such as a continuous broadened distribution or a distribution with a gap ( void ) between the halo and the core , we determine the dynamics that leads to such configurations .",
    "this is important since it enables us to deduce the form of the effective potentials which control the stationarity of the halo distribution .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we draw our conclusions and discuss future directions of research .",
    "the usual way to introduce a stochastic dynamical system is to modify the dynamics in phase space by adding a wiener noise only in the equation for the momentum , in order to preserve the usual relations between position and velocity : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the mass of the system , @xmath2 is the position variable , @xmath3 is the momentum variable , @xmath4 is the external force , and @xmath5 is a fluctuating force modelled by a wiener process ; in general , this procedure yields a differentiable , but non markovian process @xmath6 for the position ( here @xmath7 denotes the autocorrelation of the fluctuating force ) .",
    "the standard example of this approach is that of a brownian motion in a force field described by the ornstein  uhlenbeck system of stochastic differential equations ( sde ) @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the spatial gradient of the external potential , and @xmath10 is the damping constant .",
    "this system can be reduced to yield a non differentiable , markovian process @xmath6 acted on by a wiener noise , with diffusion coefficient @xmath11 , to the equation for the position . in this case",
    "we are forced to drop the equation for the momentum since @xmath12 is no longer differentiable , and we can reduce the stochastic system to the single sde @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the so called forward velocity , and @xmath15 is the increment of a standard wiener noise @xmath16 ; as it is well known , this increment is a gaussian process .",
    "the standard example of this reduction is the einstein - smoluchowski approximation of the ornstein  uhlenbeck process in the overdamped case .",
    "it is however possible to introduce eq .",
    "( [ ito ] ) in a completely different context , as the defining equation for a theory of stochastic dynamical systems in configuration space , rather than in phase space .",
    "this amounts to consider a system whose kinematics , rather than its dynamics , is taken _ ab initio _ to be random . by doing this ,",
    "no external sources of dissipation and irreversibility are introduced on the forces acting on the system . instead , a source of randomness is assumed that perturbs only the configurations of the system .",
    "for such systems with random kinematics , the dynamics can then be introduced either by generalizing the newton equation @xcite , or by introducing a stochastic variational principle @xcite .",
    "the crucial aspect is that such a dynamics turns out to be both stochastic _ and _ conservative . in this scheme ,",
    "since @xmath2 is not differentiable , there is no velocity as a standard derivative .",
    "instead it is possible to define in a suitable way @xcite an average velocity @xmath17 in the forward time direction , and an average velocity in the backward time direction @xmath18 : these functions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are different , and they both coincide with the usual velocity only if the process is differentiable , i.e. if the kinematics is deterministic . the relations between @xmath17 and @xmath18 will be introduced in the subsequent discussion .",
    "it is important to remark that @xmath21 is no more an a priori given field : it plays now the role of a dynamical variable .",
    "the stochastic dynamical scheme sketched above is known as stochastic mechanics ( sm ) , and most of its applications have concerned the problem of developing a classical stochastic model for the simulation of quantum mechanics . nonetheless , it is a very general model which can be applied to very different stochastic dynamical systems endowed with time - reversal invariance @xcite",
    ". we will show below how one can derive from the stochastic variational principle two coupled , nonlinear hydrodynamic equations for the density and the phase of a dynamical system in configuration space .",
    "these two real , coupled equations can be recast into a single complex equation whose form is completely equivalent to that of a schrdinger differential equation . in this sense , some authors denote classical dynamical systems described by sm as quantum - like systems , in analogy with other recent studies on the collective dynamics of charged particl beams @xcite .    in general , sm can be used to describe every conservative , stochastic dynamical system satisfying fairly general conditions : for instance , it is known that for any given conservative diffusion there is a correspondence between the associated diffusion process and a solution of the schrdinger equation with hamiltonians associated to suitable vector and scalar potentials @xcite . under some regularity conditions",
    "this correspondence is one - to - one .",
    "the usual schrdinger equation , and hence quantum mechanics , are recovered when the diffusion coefficient @xmath11 is independent from the values taken by the conservative diffusion process and coincides with @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the planck constant . here",
    "we are not interested in the stochastic modelling of quantum mechanics , but rather in the classical stochastic dynamics of particle beams . in this instance the unit of action appearing in the effective schrdinger equation is linked to the beam emittance as will be clarified below .",
    "we will now describe the stochastic process performed by a representative particle of the beam that oscillates , in a comoving reference frame , around the closed ideal orbit in a particle accelerator .",
    "we consider the three - dimensional ( 3d ) diffusion process @xmath24 , taking the values @xmath19 , which describes the motion of the representative particle and whose probability density coincides with the particle density of the beam . the evolution of this process is ruled by the it sde  ( [ ito ] ) where the diffusion coefficient @xmath11 is supposed to be constant . the quantity @xmath25 , which has the dimensions of an action , will be connected later to the characteristic transverse emittance of the beam",
    "( [ ito ] ) defines the random kinematics performed by the collective degree of freedom , and replaces the simple deterministic kinematics @xmath26 for the differentiable trajectory @xmath27 .",
    "we are in a situation in which we have both a random , diffusive kinematics and a time reversal invariance .",
    "therefore , to counteract the dissipation , one must impose a conservative dynamics on the stochastic kinematics , at variance with the purely dissipative fokker - planck or langevin dynamics .",
    "a conservative dynamics imposed on a random kinematics can be introduced by a suitable stochastic generalization of the least action principle of classical mechanics @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by replacing the classical deterministic kinematics ( [ classicalkin ] ) with the random diffusive kinematics ( [ ito ] ) as the independent configurational variables of the lagrangian density entering the action functional .",
    "the equations of motion thus obtained by minimizing the action functional take the form of two coupled hydrodynamic equations that describe the dynamical evolution of the beam profile and of the associated velocity field . in the following we briefly sketch the derivation of the hydrodynamic equations , referring for details to references @xcite .",
    "given the sde ( [ ito ] ) , we consider the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath28 associated to the diffusion @xmath12 so that , besides the forward velocity @xmath29 , we can also define the backward velocity @xmath30 it is also useful to introduce the current and the osmotic velocity fields , defined as : @xmath31 the velocities in eq .",
    "( [ osmotic ] ) have a transparent physical meaning : the current velocity @xmath32 represents the global velocity of the density profile , being the stochastic generalization of the velocity field of a classical perfect fluid . on the other hand",
    "the osmotic velocity @xmath33 is clearly of intrinsic stochastic nature , for it is a measure of the non differentiability of the stochastic trajectories , and it is related to the spatial variations of the density . in the limit of a deterministic process , i.e. of a diffusion that tends to a deterministic , differentiable trajectory @xmath34 , the current velocity @xmath35 tends to the classical velocity field @xmath36 , and the osmotic velocity @xmath37 tends to zero ( the trajectory becomes differentiable , so that the forward and backward velocities , i.e. the left and right derivatives coincide ) .    in order to establish",
    "the stochastic generalization of the least action principle one introduces a mean classical action averaged over the probability density function of the diffusion process , in strict analogy to the classical deterministic action . in fact , the main difficulty in the stochastic case is due to the non differentiable character of the sample paths of a diffusion process which does not allow to define the time derivative of the process @xmath12 .",
    "hence the definition of a lagrangian density and of an action functional is possible only in an average sense through a suitable limit on expectations .",
    "the stochastic action is then defined as @xcite @xmath38 dt \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath39 denotes the expectation of a function of the diffusion process @xmath12 , @xmath40 is an external potential , and @xmath41 is the finite increment of the process .",
    "it can be shown that the mean action ( [ lagrangianaction ] ) associated to the diffusive kinematics ( [ ito ] ) can be recast in the following particularly appealing eulerian hydrodynamic form @xcite : @xmath42 \\rho({\\bf r } , t ) \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath43 are defined in eq .",
    "( [ osmotic ] ) .",
    "this eulerian form of the action immediately shows that when @xmath44 ( and hence the trajectories are differentiable ) it coincides with the action for the conservative dynamics of a classical liouville fluid .",
    "the stochastic variational principle now follows by imposing the stationarity of the stochastic action ( @xmath45 ) under smooth and independent variations @xmath46 of the density , and @xmath47 of the current velocity , with vanishing boundary conditions at the initial and final times .    as a first consequence we get that the current velocity has the following gradient form : @xmath48 which can be also taken as the definition of the phase @xmath49 .",
    "the non linearly coupled lagrange equations of motion for the density @xmath50 and for the current velocity @xmath32 , of the form ( [ gradient ] ) , are a continuity equation typically associated to every diffusion process @xmath51 and an evolution equation for the conservative dynamics @xmath52 the above equations give a complete characterization of time - reversal invariant diffusion processes .",
    "the last equation is formally analogous to the hamilton ",
    "madelung ( hjm ) equation originally introduced in the hydrodynamic formulation of quantum mechanics by madelung @xcite . however , the physical origins of the two equations are profoundly different , as in the quantum mechanical case the diffusion coefficient is related to the fundamental planck constant by the relation @xmath53 .",
    "notice that when @xmath54 ( namely when the kinematics is not diffusive ) the equation  ( [ hjm ] ) coincides with the usual hamilton  jacobi equation for a liouville fluid .",
    "since ( [ gradient ] ) holds , the two equations  ( [ continuity ] ) and  ( [ hjm ] ) can be recast in the following form @xmath55 which now constitutes a coupled , non linear system of partial differential equations for the couple @xmath56 which completely determines the state of our beam . on the other hand , because of  ( [ gradient ] ) , this state is equivalently given by the couple @xmath57 .",
    "( [ continuity1 ] ) and  ( [ hjm2 ] ) describe the collective behavior of the beam at each instant of time through the evolution of both its particle density and its velocity field .",
    "it is important to notice that , introducing the representation @xcite @xmath58 with @xmath59 the two coupled real equations ( [ continuity1 ] ) and ( [ hjm2 ] ) are equivalent to a single complex schrdinger equation for the function @xmath60 , with the planck action constant @xmath23 replaced by the unit of action @xmath61 : @xmath62 in this formulation the phenomenological `` wave function '' @xmath60 carries the information on the dynamics of both the beam density and the beam velocity field , since the velocity field is determined via eq .",
    "( [ gradient ] ) by the phase function @xmath63 .",
    "this shows , as previously claimed , that our procedure , starting from a different point of view , leads to a description formally analogous to that of the so - called quantum - like approaches to beam dynamics @xcite .",
    "we remark again that obviously eq .",
    "( [ schroed ] ) has not the same meaning as in quantum mechanics .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 defined in eq .",
    "( [ alfa ] ) has the dimensions of an action , but in general @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , @xmath61 is not a universal constant and its value can not coincide with @xmath23 , as its value depends on the physical system under study .",
    "however , @xmath61 plays in some sense a role similar to that of @xmath23 in quantum mechanics since , as we will see in the following , it identifies a lower bound for the beam emittance in phase space , and gives a measure of the position - momentum uncertainty arising from the stochastic dynamics of the beam .",
    "thus the schrdinger equation  ( [ schroed ] ) for the stochastic mechanics of particle beams presents some features reminiscent of quantum mechanics , but at the same time is a deeply different theory with a different physical meaning . in particular , while in quantum mechanics a system of @xmath65 particles is described by a wave function in a @xmath66dimensional configuration space , in the scheme of sm the normalized probability density distribution @xmath67 is a function of only the three space coordinates in physical space .",
    "if there are @xmath65 particles in the beam , then the function @xmath68 is simply the particle density in physical space .",
    "in the previous section we have introduced two coupled equations that describe the dynamical behavior of the beam : the first is the it equation  ( [ ito ] ) , or equivalently the continuity equation ( either  ( [ continuity ] ) or  ( [ continuity1 ] ) ) ; the second is the hamilton - jacobi - madelung ( hjm ) equation ( either  ( [ hjm ] ) or  ( [ hjm2 ] ) ) . here",
    "we briefly summarize a general procedure , already exploited in refs .",
    "@xcite , to engineer a controlled dynamics of stochastic systems .",
    "we will then apply this method to the control of the beam halo in section  [ halodistr ] .    to this end",
    "it is useful to show , by simple substitution from ( [ osmotic ] ) , that eq .",

    "( [ vback ] ) and  ( [ osmotic ] ) that also the forward velocity @xmath70 is irrotational : @xmath76 where the scalar functions @xmath77 and @xmath49 are connected by the relation @xmath78 and @xmath79 is an arbitrary time - dependent function . through eq .",
    "( [ gradient1 ] ) , eqns .",
    "( [ fp ] ) and  ( [ hjm1 ] ) can be cast in a form analogous to the system of eqns .",
    "( [ continuity1 ] ) and  ( [ hjm2 ] ) . in this case , the couple of functions which determine the state of the beam is @xmath80 ( or equivalently @xmath81 ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that the possibility of a time reversal invariance @xcite is assured by the fact that the forward velocity @xmath82 is not an _ a priori _ given field , as is the case for dissipative diffusion processes of the langevin type .",
    "rather , it is dynamically determined at any instant of time , for any assigned initial condition , through the hjm evolution equation ( [ hjm ] ) .",
    "let us suppose now that the beam density @xmath83 is given at some time @xmath20 .",
    "we may think for instance of an engineered evolution from some initial density toward a final , required state with suitable properties .",
    "in particular , we could imagine to have a halo - ridden particle distribution in the beam that should be steered toward a final halo - free distribution .",
    "we know that @xmath50 must be a solution of the fp equation  ( [ fp ] ) for some forward velocity field @xmath84 , which we consider here as not given a priori . since also eq .",
    "( [ gradient1 ] ) must be satisfied , this means that  for a given @xmath50  we should find an irrotational @xmath70 in such a way that the fp equation  ( [ fp ] ) is satisfied . in other words , we are required to solve the partial differential equation @xmath85 for the irrotational vector field @xmath70 , or equivalently , by taking eq .",

    "another case of practical interest is that of a 3d system with cylindrical symmetry around the @xmath100-axis ( which will be supposed to be the beam longitudinal axis ) .",
    "if we denote with @xmath101 the cylindrical coordinates , where @xmath102 , we will suppose that @xmath103 depends only on @xmath104 and @xmath20 , and that @xmath105 is radially directed , with modulus depending only on @xmath104 and @xmath20 . in this case , it is straightforward to see that the equation for @xmath106 is @xmath107 whose solution is @xmath108 in this case @xmath109    finally , in the 3d stationary case the beam density @xmath50 is independent of @xmath20 .",
    "this greatly simplifies the treatment , as it is easy to check by simple substitution , and we simply find @xmath110 with @xmath111 this result corresponds to the well known fact that for stationary forward velocities the fp equation  ( [ fp ] ) always admits stationary solutions of the form @xmath112 remark however that also for particular choices of a non stationary @xmath83 it is sometimes possible to find a stationary velocity field @xmath113 such that the fp equation  ( [ fp ] ) is satisfied ( think for instance to the ornstein  uhlenbeck non stationary solutions ) : this fact will be of use in the following sections .    now that @xmath50 and @xmath77 ( or equivalently @xmath70 ) are given and satisfy eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) , we should also remember that they will qualify as a good description of our system only if they also are a solution of the dynamical problem , namely if they satisfy the hjm equation  ( [ hjm1 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath77 , @xmath70 and @xmath50 are now fixed , this last equation must be considered as a constraint relation defining an external controlling potential @xmath40 which , after straightforward calculations and in terms of the dimensionless distribution @xmath75 , turns out to be of the general form : @xmath114 this procedure can in principle be applied also to more complicated instances , for example to engineer a beam dynamics that keeps the beam coherent even in the presence of aberrations , or to engineer some desired evolution .",
    "however the solutions will not always be available in closed form , and will in general require some approximate treatment . here",
    "we present the simple analytic solutions for the three particular cases discussed above .    in the 1d case @xmath115 , with @xmath106 given by eq .",

    "one of the possible mechanisms for the formation of the halo in particle beams is that due to the unavoidable presence of space charge effects . in this section",
    "we will investigate this possibility in the framework of our hydrodynamic - stochastic model of beam dynamics .",
    "to this end , we take into account the space charge effects by coupling the hydrodynamic equations of stochastic mechanics with the maxwell equations which describe the mutual electromagnetic interactions between the particles of the beam . we thus obtain a self - consistent , stochastic magnetohydrodynamic system of coupled nonlinear differential equations that can be numerically solved to show the effect of the space charge .    in the following",

    "<S> the formation of the beam halo in charged particle accelerators is studied in the framework of a stochastic - hydrodynamic model for the collective motion of the particle beam . </S>",
    "<S> in such a stochastic - hydrodynamic theory the density and the phase of the charged beam obey a set of coupled nonlinear hydrodynamic equations with explicit time - reversal invariance . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a linearized theory that describes the collective dynamics of the beam in terms of a classical schrdinger equation . taking into account space - charge effects , we derive a set of coupled nonlinear hydrodynamic equations . </S>",
    "<S> these equations define a collective dynamics of self - interacting systems much in the same spirit as in the gross - pitaevskii and landau - ginzburg theories of the collective dynamics for interacting quantum many - body systems . </S>",
    "<S> self - consistent solutions of the dynamical equations lead to quasi - stationary beam configurations with enhanced transverse dispersion and transverse emittance growth . in the limit of a frozen space - charge core it is then possible to determine and study the properties of stationary , stable core - plus - halo beam distributions . in this scheme the possible reproduction of the halo after its elimination is a consequence of the stationarity of the transverse distribution which plays the role of an attractor for every other distribution . </S>"
