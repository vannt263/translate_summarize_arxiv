    "topological defects produced during cosmic phase transitions are a standard component of many field and brane theories and cosmologies . often they take the form of macroscopically extended classical one dimensional objects , with microscopic radius , called cosmic strings . the cosmological evolution of strings forms a population of quasi - stable loops that lose energy mainly by gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "this paper describes a new way in which these gravitational waves may be observed : a regime in which radiation from individual loops can appear as perfect harmonic series in an observed frequency spectrum .",
    "string loops oscillate , radiate gravitational waves and shrink until they completely decay .",
    "the center of mass speed of a loop when it forms is of the order of unity . after it stops interconnecting with the rest of the string network , a loop",
    "s velocity decays inversely proportional to the scale factor . at late times , the primordial velocity is negligible and the loop population clusters in almost the same way as the dominant cold , collisionless dark matter  @xcite . in the case of light strings , for which loops are small and numerous , a galaxy halo can contain a very large number of loops  @xcite .",
    "they are concentrated to high density , so the mean distance to the nearest loop is much smaller than the cosmic mean .",
    "a cosmic string loop produces a spectrum of discrete frequencies  @xcite which may be detectable if it is close enough .",
    "the spectrum of any loop is given by a sum over a nearly perfect harmonic series of frequencies @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the length of the string loop .",
    "this distinctive property is unlike any other astrophysical source of gravitational waves and if observed , would provide convincing evidence of the existence of cosmic strings , as well as detailed information about their astrophysical behavior .",
    "the power from each discrete mode @xmath4 of a loop is given by , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the mass ( energy ) density of the string .",
    "we define @xmath7 .",
    "numerical simulations indicate @xmath8 is approximately 50 to 100 .",
    "we use a value of 50 for this study .",
    "the power in each mode depends upon the particular oscillation pattern of a string loop , but the general solution of a sum of harmonic modes does not depend upon any particular model . for the illustrative estimates in this paper we assume a very simple model , again motivated by numerical estimates : the mean power of an ensemble scales as @xmath9 .",
    "loops clustered around the milky way halo , most of which are too distant to detect individually , taken together create an unresolved background of gravitational waves , akin to the white dwarf binaries  @xcite .",
    "we also estimate this confusion background .",
    "the new effects are most important for cosmic string loops with lower string tensions @xmath10",
    "@xcite and for stable loops formed at a significant fraction , @xmath11 , of the horizon  @xcite .",
    "in this situation , we find that cosmic strings are an important new source at the frequencies 0.1 hz to 10 mhz   band where _ laser interferometer space antenna _",
    "( lisa )   @xcite will be most sensitive .",
    "the extension into this regime is all the more relevant given the current limits set on cosmic string tensions via sdss , wmap , and millisecond pulars  @xcite .",
    "since the results depend on the size distribution of stable loops  @xcite , a number of possibilities are considered in the parameter studies here .",
    "the average number density of loops between size @xmath3 and @xmath12 is @xmath13 , computed numerically .",
    "the loops are assumed to be clustered around galaxies in the same way as the dark matter .",
    "the number density in the galaxy is matched to the dark matter halo , given by the nfw density distribution @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the number density is then a function of the length of loops and distance from the center of the galaxy @xmath15 .",
    "we start by figuring out the size of the loops at the fundamental frequency : @xmath16 using the one - scale model  @xcite , loops form with size @xmath17 and start to decay at a rate @xmath18 .",
    "loops created at a time @xmath19 will be of the size @xmath20 at the time @xmath21 . at the present time",
    "@xmath22 we find the fundamental frequency given by : @xmath23 the number density at @xmath22 , for time of creation @xmath19 is given by : @xmath24 using the time @xmath19 we solve numerically to find the number density .    to illustrate with typical numerical values : the average distance between galaxies is 5 mpc , the number of loops within the galaxy for @xmath25 and a fundamental frequency of 1 mhz is approximately @xmath26 .",
    "the density of galactic string loops is matched to the dark matter distribution in the milky way using the nfw density @xmath14 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are determined by observation .",
    "representative values are given by  @xcite using the favored model , e.g. @xmath29=21.5 kpc . from above",
    "we see that for @xmath30 , @xmath31 and for @xmath32 , @xmath33 .    from the previous example using strings of tension @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 kpc , we find at the earth s distance from the galactic center , @xmath38 kpc , a value of @xmath39 kpc@xmath40 , or @xmath41 kpc , an `` average '' distance to the nearest loop .",
    "the nearst loop is likely closer as the distribution is not constant over this range of position .    the number density of loops in the milky way is strongly influenced by the size and mass density of the cosmic string loops .",
    "tables  [ table1][table3 ] give results for the number of loops in the milky way for various parameterizations of the string loops .",

    "note that the power radiated is independent of the loop size . to first order",
    "we ignore directionality of the emitted gravitational radiation .",
    "each loop has a spectrum given by a set of power coefficients , @xmath46 , and the average sum for the population @xmath47 is fixed by the statistical properties of the strings .",
    "this is an average over a wide array of loops : individual loops vary from this . for most loops",
    "the most power is in the fundamental mode and the lowest modes , while the higher modes have significantly reduced power .    for a given mode",
    "the quality factor is given by , @xmath48 for light strings with @xmath25 we find , @xmath49 for the fundamental mode @xmath46 is of order unity at most , so @xmath50 is large , and increases with higher @xmath4 .",
    "thus the harmonic series is almost perfect and the lines extremely narrow .",
    "this justifies the use of delta functions in other applications .",
    "given the extremely large value of @xmath51 the signal from each mode in the loop is practically constant for the duration of observation with respect to decay .",

    "using previous results for the strain produced by a gravitational wave , we can add the harmonic time dependence to find the strain at each mode for the result : @xmath60 again , the @xmath46 are the `` power coefficients '' estimated to scale in the mean as @xmath61 . recall that the sum of coefficients is given by @xmath62 . in practice",
    "most of the power is in the fundamental mode , so the the power from lower modes drops off , allowing truncation of the sum at a reasonable value of @xmath4 . as an example",
    ", we set teh amplitudes equal to the sample mean : @xmath63 and @xmath64 . at @xmath65",
    "we find @xmath66 , giving a reasonable estimate .",
    "for a single loop the total strain will be a sum of all the modes , @xmath67 in practice a suitable cutoff is used to facilitate numerical computations .",
    "since the signal detected by lisa will be as a discrete set of points , it is useful to take a discrete fourier transform of a sample signal . in general lisa has a sampling rate of @xmath68hz , which leads to large numbers of data points for integration times of one to three years .",
    "this large number of data points also leads to a very clear signal due to the harmonic nature of the gravitaional waves produced by the cosmic strings .",
