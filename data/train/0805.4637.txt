    "it is believed that one of the signatures of a hot , dense medium expected to appear in most central high - energy collisions of heavy ions , will be modification of properties of jets  highly collimated streams of particles , originating from hard scattering of partons and therefore produced early in a collision  as a result of their interaction with that medium  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , direct reconstruction of jets in the presence of a large background typical of such events is an extremely challenging task .",
    "one possible answer to this problem is studying two - particle azimuthal correlations , which allow one to extract the jet signal from the soft background by taking advantage of the fact jet particles are strongly correlated in azimuth . in recent years",
    "rhic experiments have made this approach highly successful by not only observing the expected signatures , but also providing , through further investigations , evidence which has led to a major change of expectations regarding properties of the hot medium ( the `` perfect liquid '' description ; see _ e.g. _  @xcite ) . however , until recently ( @xcite ) no analyses of this sort were performed in the energy range of the cern sps .",
    "the na49 detector is a large - acceptance spectrometer dedicated to the study of hadron production in fixed - target nucleon - nucleon , nucleon - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions at a wide range of energies offered by the cern sps . during its eight years of running",
    "it has been used to register pb+pb collisions at 20@xmath1 , 30@xmath1 , 40@xmath1 , 80@xmath1 and 158@xmath1 gev , c+c and si+si collisions at 40@xmath1 and 158@xmath1 gev , along with p+p and p+pb interactions at 158@xmath1 gev .",
    "the main components of the detector are four time projection chambers , used for tracking as well as particle identification by de / dx .",
    "two of the chambers , the so - called vertex tpcs , are located inside two superconducting magnets ( with field intensity of 1.5 and 1.1  t , respectively ) positioned along the beam axis right downstream of the target , with the other two ( `` main '' tpcs ) placed further downstream on both sides of the beam line .",
    "two time of flight walls located beyond the mtpcs complement particle identification in the intersection region of bethe - bloch de / dx bands .",
    "centrality selection in nucleus - nucleus collisions is based on the projectile spectator energy deposited in the veto calorimeter , located at the downstream end of the experiment .",
    "the present analysis is based on 3  million central pb+pb collisions at 158@xmath1  gev recorded by na49 in the year 2000 .",
    "the two - particle correlation function is calculated independently in four event centrality bins : 0 - 5  % , 5 - 10  % , 10 - 15  % , and 15 - 20  % .",
    "the transverse momentum bins are @xmath2 for trigger particles and @xmath3 for associates .    following the prescription of the phenix collaboration  @xcite we define the correlation function as a ratio of two normalised distributions of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the azimuthal angle : @xmath6 , in which both particles come from the same event , and @xmath7 , in which the trigger and the associate originate from different events .",
    "division by the mixed - event spectrum accounts for non - uniform detector acceptance .",
    "@xmath8 in this analysis the mixing is accomplished with a sliding window of up to 50 most recent events in each centrality bin .",
    "the resulting correlation functions are shown in the top row of fig .",

    "the two flow terms @xmath11 and @xmath12 have been obtained from an independent reaction - plane analysis  @xcite , see table  [ tbl : v2values ] for the values .",
