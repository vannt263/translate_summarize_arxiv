    "with device fabrication in the submicron or nanometer regime , it is possible to fabricate mechanical oscillators with very high fundamental frequencies and high mechanical quality factors . in the regime when the individual mechanical quanta are of the order of or greater than the thermal energy , quantum effects become important .",
    "recently , a high - frequency mechanical resonator beam that operates at ghz frequencies has been reported hzmr03 . unlike quantum optical systems where extremely high frequency oscillators , vacuum environments , zero temperature , and well - isolated systems are the usual setup , solid state systems normally exist at finite temperatures and interact with their surroundings . for a resonator operating at the fundamental frequency of ghz and at a temperature of 100mk , on average only 20 vibrational quanta",
    "are present in the fundamental mode .",
    "an interesting question is : can we observe quantum jumps , i.e. , discrete ( fock or number state ) transitions in such a true mechanical oscillator in a mesoscopic solid system @xcite , as the mechanical oscillator exchanges quanta with the outside world or environment ? in order to observe quantum jumps , one needs to design a scheme to measure the phonon number of the oscillator so that the oscillator will stay in a certain phonon number state long enough before it jumps to another phonon number state due to the inevitable interaction with its environment , usually through linear coupling to the oscillator position .    to achieve a quantum mechanical phonon number measurement of a mechanical oscillator , conventional measurement methods , such as the direct displacement measurement , @xcite",
    "can not be simply applied since the observable ( i.e. , the number of phonons in the oscillator ) does not commute with , for example , the position or displacement operator . thus , naively attaching a readout transducer to the mechanical oscillator results in inaccurate subsequent measurements due to back action .",
    "one thus must make sure that the transducer that couples to the mechanical resonator measures only the mean - square position , without coupling linearly to the resonator s position itself @xcite .",
    "some preliminary experiments in this direction have been conducted .",
    "they use a second , driven mechanical oscillator ( oscillator @xmath0 in fig .  [ model ] ) as the transducer to measure the mean - square position of the system oscillator ( oscillator @xmath1 in fig .  [ model ] ) .",
    "hereafter , we use the notations of the system oscillator  and ancilla oscillator  in the text , but keep @xmath1  and @xmath0  as subscripts in the mathematical notations .",
    "the basic idea is that the non - linear , quadratic - in - position coupling between the two oscillators shifts the resonance frequency of the ancilla oscillator by an amount proportional to the phonon number or energy excitation of the system oscillator .",
    "this frequency shift may be detected as a phase shift of the oscillations of the ancilla oscillator with respect to the driving , when driven at a fixed frequency near resonance .",
    "also , the ancilla oscillator needs to have sufficient sensitivity to resolve an individual quantum jump .    in the analysis of this measurement scheme presented by santamore , doherty , and",
    "cross @xcite , self - anharmonic terms @xmath2 , in the two mechanical oscillators were neglected due to the smallness of the coupling coefficients compared to their harmonic oscillation frequencies , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the displacement of the oscillators position from equilibrium . since the self - anharmonic terms are of the same order as the nonlinear coupling term @xmath5 , it is important to include those terms and analyze the effects on the proposed measurement scheme .    in this paper , we extend the work of ref .",
    "@xcite and investigate the effects of self - anharmonic terms  on a phonon number measurement . due to the higher order self - anharmonic terms , the adiabatic elimination method used in ref .",
    "@xcite may not be straightforwardly applied even with the assumption of a heavily damped ancilla oscillator due to measurement . here",
    "we take a slightly different approach . as the ancilla",
    "is assumed to be heavily damped , it will relax very rapidly to its steady state within a timescale on the order of typical response time of the system oscillator , and will appear to the system oscillator effectively as a bath . to see the consequences of a rapidly decaying ancilla oscillator on the dynamics of the system oscillator",
    ", we use the quantum open systems approach to find the master equation for the reduced density matrix of the system oscillator . in obtaining the master equation ,",
    "the correlation functions of the effective bath  ( or the ancilla oscillator ) are calculated using the generalized p - representation approach @xcite .",
    "the generalized p - representation approach has the advantage of removing some of the unnecessary restrictions imposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we find that in the presence of self - anharmonic term , @xmath6 , of the ancilla oscillator , the effect of increasing driving strength and self - nonlinearity tends to shift the resonance frequency , increase the peak value and decrease the width of the response of the peak of @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ qj_gamma ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 is the ratio of the back - action diffusion coefficient ( or decoherence rate ) @xmath9 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : rateg ] ) ] and its value @xmath10 at zero self - anharmonicity and zero detuning .",
    "if the damping of the ancilla oscillator is much larger than the effect of the self - anharmonic term , the overall effect of self - anharmonic term on the phonon number measurement is small . finally , we show that the induced electromotive readout current ygpb94 from the ancilla oscillator provides information on the phonon number of the system , even in the presence of higher order anharmonic terms , and we obtain the relation between the current and the measured system observable .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss briefly the measurement scheme and hamiltonian , and obtain the master equation for the model described above while keeping higher order self - anharmonic terms .",
    "it turns out that the master equation we obtain requires two - time correlations of the ancilla oscillator operators .",
    "section [ sec_correlation ] deals with this issue .",
    "we find one - time and two - time correlation functions of the ancilla . in sec .",

    "and @xmath0 are anharmonically coupled with coupling strength @xmath11 .",
    "both oscillators are subjected to thermal noise injection and dissipation .",
    "the oscillator @xmath0 is driven and a readout apparatus is attached to it.,width=432 ]    our model consists of two mesoscopic scale mechanical bridges with rectangular cross section .",
    "one serves as a system oscillator ( oscillator 0 in fig .",

    "the other is used as an ancilla oscillator ( oscillator 1 in fig .",

    "a schematic illustration is reproduced in fig .",
    "[ model ] . these mesoscopic - size elastic bridges or beams with rectangular cross - section",
    "are connected by a device that transmits only one of the flexing modes of the system oscillator to the ancilla oscillator . as a result , these two resonators are anharmonically and symmetrically coupled ( for experimental progress toward the scheme , see ref .",
    "we label the measured system oscillator with subscript @xmath1 and the ancilla oscillator with subscript @xmath0 , with corresponding resonant frequencies of the two flexing modes labelled as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the ancilla oscillator is driven at frequency @xmath14 with strength @xmath15 .",
    "a measuring apparatus is attached to the ancilla oscillator .",
    "the whole structure is subjected to the thermal bath environment .",
    "the interaction of the system oscillator with the thermal bath causes thermal dissipation and excitation of the system oscillator , which results in random - in - time transitions between phonon number eigenstates ( i.e. , quantum jumps ) .",
    "a change in the energy of the system oscillator appears to the ancilla oscillator as a shift of the resonant frequency via the anharmonic coupling .",
    "this frequency shift may be detected as a phase shift of the oscillations of the ancilla oscillator with respect to the driving , when driven at a fixed frequency near resonance .",
    "the free hamiltonian for the two bridge oscillators @xmath1 and @xmath0 is @xmath16where @xmath17 are creation and annihilation operators for oscillator @xmath1 , respectively , and similarly , @xmath18 for oscillator @xmath0 .",

    "the two oscillators are coupled anharmonically through the special coupling device that controls and allows only one type of strain ( the longitudinal stretch ) to pass to other oscillator . beyond the linear elasticity",
    "theory , the two flexing modes , which are perpendicular to each other , are coupled .",
    "expansion of the elastic energy with respect to the strain tensor is taken up to second order .",
    "the next term , cubic in the elastic energy , gives quadratic terms in the equation of motion @xcite .",
    "since the coupling of the two modes of the two beams is symmetric , and since the two modes are not coupled at the linear level , the first order in coupling is @xmath24 , where @xmath25  is the displacement operator .",
    "so we expand the anharmonic terms up to first order in coupling and obtain @xmath26where @xmath27 is the coupling coefficient .",
    "the high frequencies of the resonators , i.e. , @xmath28 much larger than @xmath29 and their damping rates , allows us to use the rotating wave approximation .",
    "thus we write the anharmonic terms as @xmath30where we have defined the standard raising and lowering operators for the oscillators : @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the hermitian conjugate of @xmath33 and similarly for @xmath34 and @xmath35 with the subscript @xmath1 replaced by @xmath36 .",
    "we have also introduced new coefficients @xmath37 s ( without tildes ) which all have the same dimension of frequency .    the coupling term @xmath38  commutes with the observable @xmath39 , enabling a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement .",
    "the terms @xmath40 and @xmath41 shift the resonance frequency by a constant amount , so we have absorbed these quantities into @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the terms @xmath42 and @xmath43 are analogous to kerr non - linearities in nonlinear optics . since these terms commute with the measured observable @xmath44 , they will not change the system phonon number eigenstates ; however , the kerr effect causes an intensity dependent phase shift . unlike a coherent state , in which this effect results in rotational shearing",
    ", a thermal state will not be affected by phase shift , due to its rotational invariance .",
    "as for detecting phonon number in the system oscillator , we adapt a magnetomotive detection scheme suggested by yurke et al ygpb94,cr96,cr99 .",
    "the voltage developed is proportional to @xmath45 , where @xmath46  is the displacement of the beam from its equilibrium position .",
    "the current induced by this voltage is monitored by phase lock - in amplifier .",
    "an experimenter monitors the amplitude of the current and its phase with respect to the driving current that is set to a frequency near resonance .",
    "the details of the relation between the measured current and the phonon number of the system oscillator are derived in ref .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "there are two physically distinct environments in the model : the thermo - mechanical environment of each oscillator and the electronic noise environment of the electrical system that ultimately provides information on the motion of the ancilla .",
    "the environments are modelled as thermal baths , each consisting of an infinite number of harmonic oscillators .",
    "the couplings between the oscillators and the thermal baths are considered as weak , linear and markovian ; thus we use the rotating wave approximation .",
