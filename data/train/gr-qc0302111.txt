    "in my lecture i will try to explain how scattering and merging processes between black holes can be described analytically in general relativity(gr ) .",
    "this is a vast subject and i will focus attention to the basic issues , rather than trying to explain analytical details of approximation schemes etc .",
    "i will also not discuss numerical aspects , which are beyond my competence , and which would anyway require a separate lecture .",
    "i will address the following main topics :    1 .   a first step beyond newtonian gravity , 2 .",
    "constrained evolutionary structure of einstein s equations , 3 .   the 3 + 1- split and the cauchy initial - value problem , 4 .",
    "black hole data , 5 .",
    "problems and recent developments ,    with emphasis on the fourth entry .",
    "however , i will also spend some time to explain some of the specialties of gr , like the absence of a point - particle concept and the non - trivial linkage between the field equations and the equations of motion for matter .",
    "these points should definitely be appreciated before one goes on to discuss black holes , which are solutions to the _ vacuum _ einstein equations representing _ extended _ objects .",
    "the following points seem to me the main motivations for studying the problem of black hole collision :    * coalescing black holes are regarded as promising sources for the detection of gravitational waves by earth - based instruments . * close encounters of black holes provide physically relevant situations for the investigation of the strong - field regime of general relativity . *",
    "the dynamics of simple black hole configurations is regarded as ideal testbed for numerical relativity .",
    "my conventions are as follows : space - time is a manifold @xmath0 with lorentzian metric @xmath1 of signature @xmath2 .",
    "greek indices range from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , latin indices from @xmath5 to @xmath4 unless stated otherwise .",
    "the covariant derivative is denoted @xmath6 , ordinary partial derivatives by @xmath7 or sometimes simply by a lower - case @xmath8 .",
    "the relation @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) defines the left ( right ) hand side .",
    "the gravitational constant in gr is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is newton s constant and @xmath13 the velocity of light .",
    "a symbol like @xmath14 stands collectively for terms falling off at least as fast as @xmath15 .",
    "it can hardly be overstressed how useful the concept of a _ mass - point _ is in newtonian mechanics and gravity .",
    "it allows to _ pointwise _ probe the gravitational field and to reduce the dynamical problem to the mathematical problem of finding solutions to a system of _ finitely _ many _ ordinary _ differential equations . to be sure ,",
    "just postulating the existence of mass points is not sufficient . to be consistent with known laws of physics",
    "one must eventually understand the point mass as an idealization of a highly localized mass distribution which obeys known field - theoretic laws , such that in the situations at hand most of the field degrees of freedom effectively decouple from the dynamical laws for those collective degrees of freedom one is interested in , like e.g. the centre - of - mass . in newtonian gravity",
    "this usually requires clever approximation schemes but is not considered to be a problem of fundamental nature .",
    "although this is true for the specific linear theory of newtonian gravity , this needs not be so for comparably simple generalizations , as will become clear below .    in gr",
    "the situation is markedly different .",
    "a concentration of more than one schwarzschild mass in a region of radius less than the schwarzschild radius will lead to a black hole whose behaviour away from the stationary state usually can not be well described by finitely many degrees of freedom .",
    "it shakes and vibrates , thereby radiating off energy and angular momentum in form of gravitational radiation .",
    "moreover , it is an extended object and can not be unambiguously ascribed an ( absolute or relative ) position or individual mass .",
    "hence the problem of motion , and therefore the problem of scattering of black holes , can not be expected to merely consist of _ corrections _ to newtonian scattering problems .",
    "rather , the whole kinematic and dynamical setup will be different where many of the established concepts of newtonian physics need to be replaced or at least adapted , very often in a somewhat ambiguous way . among those are mass , distance , and kinetic energy .",
    "for example , one may try to solve the following straightforward sounding problem in gr , whose solution one might think has been given long ago .",
    "given are two unspinning black holes , momentarily at rest , with equal individual mass @xmath16 , mutual distance @xmath17 , and no initial gravitational radiation around .",
    "what is the amount of energy released via gravitational radiation during the dynamical infall ?",
    "in such situation we can usually make sense of the notions of ` spin ' ( hence unspinning ) and ` mass ' ; but ambiguities generally exist in defining ` distance ' and , most important of all , ` initial gravitational radiation ' .",
    "such difficulties persist over and above the ubiquitous analytical and/or numerical problems which are currently under attack by many research groups .    to those who are not so familiar with gr and like to see newtonian analogies ,",
    "i wish to mention that there is a way to _",
    "consistently _ model some of the non - linear features of einstein s equations in a newtonian context , which shares the property that it does not allow for point masses .",
    "i will briefly describe this model since it does not seem to be widely known .",
    "first recall the field equation in newtonian gravity , which allows to determine the gravitational potential @xmath18 ( whose negative gradient , -@xmath19 , is the gravitational field ) from the mass density @xmath20 ( the ` source ' of the gravitational field ) : @xmath21 now suppose one imposes the following principle for a modification of ( [ eq : poisson - eq ] ) : all energies , including the self - energy of the gravitational field , act as source for the gravitational field . in order to convert an energy density @xmath22 into a mass density @xmath20",
    ", we adopt the relation @xmath23 from special relativity ( the equation we will arrive at can easily be made lorentz invariant by adding appropriate time - derivatives ) .",
    "the question then is whether one can modify the source term of ( [ eq : poisson - eq ] ) such that @xmath24 with @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the energy density of the gravitational field _ as predicted by this very same equation _",
    "( condition of self - consistency ) .",
    "it turns out that there is indeed a unique such modification , which reads @xmath27\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : mod - poisson - eq}\\ ] ] it is shown in the appendix that this equation indeed satisfies the ` energy principle ' as just stated .",
    "( for more information and a proof of uniqueness , see @xcite . ) the gravitational potential is now required to be always positive , tending to the value @xmath28 at spatial infinity ( rather than zero as for ( [ eq : poisson - eq ] ) ) .",
    "the second term on the right hand side of ( [ eq : mod - poisson - eq ] ) corresponds to the energy density of the gravitational field . unlike the energy density following from ( [ eq : poisson - eq ] ) ( which is @xmath29 ) it is now _ positive _ definite",
    "this does not contradict attractivity of gravity for the following reason : the rest - energy density of a piece of matter is in this theory not given by @xmath30 , but by @xmath31 , that is , it depends on the value of the gravitational potential at the location of matter .",
    "the same piece of matter located at lower gravitational potential has less energy than at higher potential values . in gr",
    "this is called the universal redshift effect . here ,",
    "as in gr , the active gravitational - mass also suffers from this redshift , as is immediate from the first term on the right hand side of ( [ eq : mod - poisson - eq ] ) , where @xmath20 does not enter alone , as in ( [ eq : poisson - eq ] ) , but is multiplied with the gravitational potential @xmath18 . with respect to these features our modification ( [ eq : mod - poisson - eq ] ) of newtonian gravity mimics gr quite well .",
    "we mention in passing that ( [ eq : mod - poisson - eq ] ) can be ` linearized ' by introducing the dimensionless field @xmath32 , in terms of which ( [ eq : mod - poisson - eq ] ) reads @xmath33 the boundary conditions are now @xmath34 .",
    "hence only those linear combinations of solutions are again solutions whose coefficients add up to one .",
    "for @xmath35 it also follows that solutions to ( [ eq : linearization ] ) can never assume negative values , since otherwise the function @xmath36 must have a negative minimum ( because of the positive boundary values ) and therefore non - negative second derivatives there .",
    "but then ( [ eq : linearization ] ) can not be satisfied at the minimum , hence @xmath36 must be nonnegative everywhere .",
    "this implies that solutions of ( [ eq : mod - poisson - eq ] ) are also non - negative . to be sure , for mathematical purposes ( [ eq : linearization ] )",
    "is easier to use than ( [ eq : mod - poisson - eq ] ) , but note that @xmath18 and not @xmath36 is the physical gravitational potential .",
    "we now show how these non - linear features render impossible the notion of point mass , and even induce a certain black - hole behaviour on their solutions .",
    "let us be interested in static , spherically symmetric solutions to ( [ eq : mod - poisson - eq ] ) with source @xmath20 , which is zero for @xmath37 and constant for @xmath38 .",
    "we need to distinguish two notions of mass .",
    "one mass just counts the amount of ` stuff ' located within @xmath38 .",
    "you may call it ` bare mass ' or ` baryonic mass ' , since for ordinary matter it is proportional to the baryon number .",
    "we denote it by @xmath39 .",
    "it is simply given by @xmath40 the other mass is the ` gravitational mass ' , which is measured by the amount of flux of the gravitational field to ` infinity ' , that is , through the surface of a sphere whose radius tends to infinity .",
    "we call this mass @xmath41 .",
    "it is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the 2-sphere or radius @xmath46 and @xmath47 is its surface element .",
    "@xmath41 should be identified with the total inertial mass of the system , in full analogy to the adm - mass in gr ( see eq . (",
    "[ eq : adm - mass ] ) below ) .",
    "hence @xmath48 is the total energy of the system , with gravitational binding energy also taken into account .",
    "the masses @xmath39 and @xmath41 can dimensionally be turned into radii by writing @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and further turned into dimensionless quantities via rescaling with @xmath51 , the radius of our homogeneous star .",
    "we write @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    for each pair of values for the two parameters @xmath39 and @xmath51 there is a unique homogeneous - star - solution to ( [ eq : mod - poisson - eq ] ) , whose simple analytical form needs not interest us here ( see @xcite ) . using it we can calculate @xmath41 , whose dependence on the parameters is best expressed in terms of the dimensionless quantities @xmath54 and @xmath55 : @xmath56 the function @xmath57 maps the interval @xmath58 $ ] monotonically to @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "this implies the following inequality @xmath60 which says that the gravitational mass of the star is bounded by a purely geometric quantity .",
    "it corresponds to the statement in gr that the star s radius must be bigger than its schwarzschild radius , which in isotropic coordinates is indeed given by @xmath61 .",
    "it can be proven @xcite that the bound ( [ eq : schwarzschild - inequality ] ) still exists for non - homogeneous spherically symmetric stars , so that the somewhat unphysical homogeneity assumption can be lifted .",
    "the physical reason for this inequality is the ` redshift ' , i.e. the fact , that the same bare mass at lower gravitational potential produces less gravitational mass . hence adding more and more bare mass into the same volume",
    "pushes the potential closer and closer to zero ( recall that @xmath18 is always positive ) so that the added mass becomes less and less effective in generating gravitational fields .",
    "the inequality then expresses the mathematical fact that this ` redshifting ' is sufficiently effective so as to give finite upper bounds to the gravitational mass , even for unbounded amounts of bare mass .",
    "the energy balance can also be nicely exhibited . integrating the matter energy density @xmath62 and the energy density of the gravitational field , @xmath63",
    ", we obtain @xmath64 note that the term @xmath65 in ( [ eq : energy - total ] ) is just the newtonian binding energy . at this point",
    "it is instructive to verify the remarks we made above about the positivity of the gravitational energy . shrinking a mass distribution _",
    "enhances _ the field energy , but diminishes the matter energy twice as fast , so that the overall energy is also diminished , as it must due to the attractivity of gravity . but here this is achieved with all energies involved being positive , unlike in newtonian gravity .",
    "note that the total energy , @xmath41 , can not become negative ( since @xmath18 can not become negative , as already shown ) .",
    "hence one also can not extract an infinite amount of energy by unlimited compression , as it is possible in newtonian gravity .",
    "this is the analogue in our model theory to the positive mass theorem in gr .",
    "we conclude by making the point announced above , namely that the inequality ( [ eq : schwarzschild - inequality ] ) shows that point objects of finite gravitational mass do not exist in the theory based upon ( [ eq : mod - poisson - eq ] ) ; mass implies extension ! taken together with the lesson from special relativity , that extended rigid bodies also do not exist ( since the speed of elastic waves is less than @xmath13 ) , we arrive at the conclusion that the dynamical problem of gravitating bodies and their interaction is fundamentally of field - theoretic ( rather than point - mechanical ) nature .",
    "its proper realization is gr to which we now turn .",
    "in gr the basic field is the spacetime metric @xmath66 , which comprises the gravitational and inertial properties of spacetime .",
    "it defines what inertial motion is , namely a geodesic @xmath67 with respect to the levi - civita connection @xmath68 ( since inertial motion is ` force - free ' by definition , you may rightly ask whether it is correct to call gravity a ` force ' . )",
    "the gravitational field @xmath66 is linked to the matter content of spacetime , represented in form of the energy momentum tensor @xmath69 , by einstein s equations @xmath70 due to the gauge - invariance with respect to general differentiable point transformations ( i.e. diffeomorphisms ) of spacetime one has the _ identities _ ( as a consequence of noether s 2nd theorem ) @xmath71 being ` identities ' they hold for any @xmath72 , independent of any field equation . with respect to some coordinate system",
    "@xmath73 we can expand ( [ eq : bianchi - id ] ) in terms of ordinary derivatives . preferring the coordinate @xmath74 ,",
    "this reads @xmath75 since @xmath72 contains no higher derivatives of @xmath66 than the second , the right - hand side of this equation also contains only 2nd @xmath74-derivatives .",
    "hence ( [ eq : bianchi - expanded ] ) implies that the four components @xmath76 only involve first @xmath74-derivatives .",
    "now choose @xmath74 as time coordinate .",
    "the four @xmath77-components of ( [ eq : einstein ] ) then do not involve second time derivatives , unlike the space - space components @xmath78 .",
    "hence the time - time and time - space components are _ constraints _ , that is , equations that constrain the allowed choices of initial data , rather than evolving them .",
    "that is not an unfamiliar situation , which similarly occurs for maxwell s equations in electromagnetism ( em ) .",
    "let us recall this analogy .",
    "we consider the four - dimensional form of maxwell s equations in terms of the vector potential @xmath79 , whose antisymmetric derivative is the field - tensor @xmath80 , comprising the electric ( @xmath81 ) and magnetic ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 cyclic ) field .",
    "maxwell s equations are @xmath84 due to its antisymmetry , the field tensor obviously obeys the identity @xmath85 which here is the analogue of ( [ eq : bianchi - id ] ) , an identity involving third derivatives in the field variables . using ( [ eq : em - id ] ) in the divergence of ( [ eq : maxwell ] ) yields @xmath86 which shows that maxwell s equations imply charge conservation as integrability condition .",
    "let us interpret the rle of charge conservation in the initial value problem .",
    "decomposing ( [ eq : em - id ] ) into space and time derivatives gives @xmath87 again the right hand side involves only second time derivatives implying that the @xmath3-component of ( [ eq : maxwell ] ) involves no second time derivatives .",
    "hence the time component of ( [ eq : maxwell ] ) is merely a constraint on the initial data ; clearly it is just gauss law @xmath88 .",
    "its change under time evolution according to maxwell s equations is @xmath89 where we used the identity ( [ eq : identity - maxwell ] ) in the second step .",
    "suppose now that on the initial surface of constant @xmath74 we put an electromagnetic field which satisfies the constraint , @xmath90 , and which we evolve according to @xmath91 ( implying @xmath92 on that initial surface )",
    ". then ( [ eq : evol - constr ] ) shows that charge conservation is the necessary and sufficient condition for the evolution to preserve the constraint .",
    "let us return to gr now , where the overall situation is entirely analogous .",
    "now we have four constraints @xmath93 and six evolution equations , which we write @xmath94 the identity ( [ eq : bianchi - id ] ) now implies @xmath95 which parallels ( [ eq : identity - maxwell ] ) . here , too , the time derivative of the constraints is easily calculated : @xmath96 using ( [ eq : identity - einstein ] ) in the last step .",
    "now consider again the evolution of initial data from a surface of constant @xmath74 . if they initially satisfy the constraints and are evolved via @xmath97 ( hence all spatial derivatives of @xmath98 vanish initially ) they continue to satisfy the constraints if and only if the energy momentum tensor of the matter satisfies @xmath99 hence we see that the ` covariant conservation ' of energy - momentum , expressed by ( [ eq : em - conservation ] ) , plays the same rle in gr as charge conservation plays in em .",
    "this means that you can not just prescribe the motion of matter and then use einstein s equations to calculate the gravitational field produced by that source .",
    "you have to move the matter in such a way that it satisfies ( [ eq : em - conservation ] ) . but note that at this point there is a crucial mathematical difference to charge conservation in em : charge conservation is a condition on the source _ only _ , it does not involve the electromagnetic field .",
    "this means that you know _ a priori _ what to do in order not to violate charge conservation . on the other hand , ( [ eq : em - conservation ] ) involves the source _ and _ the gravitational field .",
    "the latter enters through the covariant derivatives which involve the metric @xmath66 through the connection coefficients ( [ eq : christoffel ] ) .",
    "hence here ( [ eq : em - conservation ] ) can not be solved a priori by suitably restricting the motion of the source .",
    "rather we have a consistency condition which _ mutually _ links the problem of motion for the sources and the problem of field determination .",
    "it is this difference which makes the problem of motion in gr exceedingly difficult .",
    "( a brief and lucid presentation of this problem , drawing attention to its relevance in calculating the generation of gravitational radiation by self - gravitating systems , was given in @xcite .",
    "a broader summary , including modern developments is @xcite ) .",
    "for example , for pressureless dust represented by @xmath100 , where @xmath20 is the local rest - mass density and @xmath101 is the vector field of four - velocities of the continuously dispersed individual dust grains , ( [ eq : em - conservation ] ) is equivalent to the two equations @xmath102 the first states the conservation of rest - mass .",
    "the second is equivalent to the statement that the vector field @xmath101 is geodesic , which means that its integral lines ( the worldlines of the dust grains ) are geodesic curves ( [ eq : geodesic ] ) _ with respect to the metric @xmath66_. hence we see that in this case the motion of matter is fully determined by ( [ eq : em - conservation ] ) , i.e. by einstein s equations , which imply ( [ eq : em - conservation ] ) as integrability condition .",
    "this clearly demonstrates how the problem of motion is inseparably linked with the problem of field determination , and that these problems can only be solved simultaneously . the methods used today use clever approximation schemes .",
    "for example , one can make use of the fact that there is a difference of one power in @xmath103 between the field equations and their integrability condition . hence , in an approximation in @xmath103 it is consistent for the @xmath104th order approximation of the field equations to have the integrability conditions ( equations of motions ) satisfied to @xmath105st order .",
    "clearly the problem just discussed does not arise for the matter - free einstein equations for which @xmath106 . now recall that black holes too are described by the matter free equations .",
    "hence the mathematical problem just described does not occur in the discussion of their dynamics . in _ this _ aspect the discussion of black hole scattering is considerably easier than e.g. that of neutron stars .",
    "we saw that the ten einstein equations decompose into two sets of four and six equations respectively , four constraints which the initial data have to satisfy , and six equations driving the evolution . as a consequence",
    "there will be four dynamically undetermined components among the ten components of the gravitational field @xmath66 .",
    "the task is to parametrise the @xmath66 in such a way that four dynamically undetermined functions can be cleanly separated from the other six .",
    "one way to achieve this is via the splitting of spacetime into space and time ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "the four dynamically undetermined quantities will be the famous _ lapse _ ( one function @xmath107 ) and _ shift _ ( three functions @xmath108 ) .",
    "the dynamically determined quantity is the riemannian metric @xmath109 on the spatial 3-manifolds of constant time .",
    "these together parametrise @xmath66 as follows : @xmath110 the physical interpretation of @xmath107 and @xmath108 is as follows : think of spacetime as the history of space .",
    "each ` moment ' of time , @xmath111 , corresponds to an entire 3-dimensional slice @xmath112 .",
    "obviously there is plenty of freedom how to ` waft ' space through spacetime .",
    "this freedom corresponds precisely to the freedom to choose the 1 + 3 functions @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "for one thing , you may freely specify how far for each parameter step @xmath113 you push space in a perpendicular direction forward in time .",
    "this is controlled by @xmath107 , which is just the ratio @xmath114 of the _ proper _ perpendicular distance between the hypersurfaces @xmath112 and @xmath115 .",
    "this speed may be chosen in a space and time dependent fashion , which makes @xmath107 a function on spacetime .",
    "second , given a point with coordinates @xmath116 on @xmath112 .",
    "going from @xmath116 in a perpendicular direction you meet @xmath115 in a point with coordinates @xmath117 , where @xmath118 can be chosen at will .",
    "this freedom of moving the coordinate system around while evolving is captured by @xmath108 ; one writes @xmath119 .",
    "clearly this moving around of the spatial coordinates can also be made in a space and time dependent fashion , so that the @xmath108 are functions of spacetime , too .",
    "let @xmath120 be the vector field in spacetime which is normal to the spatial sections of constant time .",
    "it is given by @xmath121 , as one may readily verify using ( [ eq : split - metric ] ) ( you have to check that @xmath104 is normalized and satisfies @xmath122 ) .",
    "we define the _ extrinsic curvature _ , @xmath123 , to be one - half the lie derivative of the spatial metric in the direction of the normal : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the spatial covariant derivative with respect to the metric @xmath109 . as usual , a round bracket around indices denotes their symmetrization .",
    "note that , by definition , @xmath123 is symmetric .",
    "finally we denote the ricci scalar of @xmath109 by @xmath126 .",
    "we can now write down the four constraints of the vacuum einstein equations in terms of these variables : @xmath127 ( [ eq : ham - constraint ] ) and ( [ eq : mom - constraint ] ) are referred to as _",
    "hamiltonian constraint _ and _ momentum constraint _ respectively .",
    "the six evolution equations of second order in the time derivative can now be written as twelve equations of first order .",
    "six of them are just ( [ eq : def - ext - curv ] ) , read as equation that relates the time derivative @xmath128 to the ` canonical data ' @xmath129 .",
    "the other six equations , whose explicit form needs not concern us here ( see e.g. @xcite ) , express the time derivative of @xmath123 in terms of the canonical data . both sets of evolution equations contain on their right hand sides the lapse and shift functions , whose evolution is not determined but must be specified by hand .",
    "this specification is a choice of gauge , without which one can not determine the evolution of the physical variables @xmath129 .",
    "the initial - data problem takes now the following form    1 .",
    "choose a topological 3-manifold @xmath130 .",
    "2 .   find on @xmath130 a riemannian metric @xmath109 and a symmetric tensor field @xmath123 which satisfy the constraints ( [ eq : ham - constraint ] ) and ( [ eq : mom - constraint ] ) .",
    "3 .   choose a lapse function @xmath107 and a shift vector field @xmath108 , both as functions of space and time , possibly according to some convenient prescription ( e.g. singularity avoiding gauges , like maximal slicing ) .",
    "4 .   evolve initial data with these choices of @xmath107 and @xmath108 according to the twelve equations of first order . by consistency of einstein s equations the constraints",
    "will be preserved during this evolution , independent of the choices for @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the backbone of this setup is a mathematical theorem , which states that for any set of initial data , taken from a suitable function space , there is , up to diffeomorphism , a unique maximal einstein spacetime developing from these data  @xcite .",
    "by black hole data we understand vacuum data which contain _ apparent horizons_. the informal definition of an apparent horizon is that it is the boundary of a trapped region , which means that its orthogonal outgoing null rays must have zero divergence .",
    "( inside the trapped region they converge for any 2-surface , by definition of ` trapped region ' . )",
    "the penrose - hawking singularity theorems state that the existence of an apparent horizon implies that the evolving spacetime will be singular ( assuming the strong energy - condition ) . given also the condition that singularities can not be seen by observers far off , a condition usually called _ cosmic censorship _",
    ", one infers the existence of an _ event horizon _ and hence a black hole .",
    "one can then show that the intersection of the event horizon with the spatial hypersurface lies on or outside the apparent horizon ( for stationary spacetimes they coincide ) .",
    "the reason why one does not deal with event horizons directly is that you can not tell whether there exists one by just looking at initial data . in principle",
    "you would have to evolve them to the infinite future , which is beyond our abilities in general .",
    "in contrast , apparent horizons can be recognized once the data on an initial slice are given .",
    "the formal definition of an apparent horizon is the following : given initial data @xmath131 and an embedded 2-surface @xmath132 with outward pointing normal @xmath133 .",
    "@xmath134 is an apparent horizon if and only if the following relation between @xmath123 , the extrinsic curvature of @xmath130 in spacetime , and @xmath135 , the extrinsic curvature of @xmath134 in @xmath130 , is satisfied : @xmath136 where @xmath137 is just the induced riemannian metric on @xmath134 , so that ( [ eq.def-apparent-horizon ] ) simply says that the restriction of @xmath123 to the tangent space of @xmath134 has opposite trace to @xmath135 .",
    "( the minus sign on the rhs of ( [ eq.def-apparent-horizon ] ) signifies a _ future _ apparent horizon corresponding to a _ black _ hole which has a _ future _ event horizon .",
    "a plus sign would signify a past apparent horizon corresponding to a ` _ _ white _ _ hole ' with _ past _ event horizon . )",
    "this means that once we have the data @xmath131 we can in principle find all 2-surfaces @xmath132 for which ( [ eq.def-apparent-horizon ] ) holds and therefore find all apparent horizons .      by poincar charges",
    "we shall understand quantities like mass , linear momentum , and angular momentum .",
    "in gr they are associated to an asymptotic poincar symmetry ( see @xcite ) , provided that the data @xmath131 are _ asymptotically flat _ in a suitable sense , which we now explain .",
    "topologically asymptotic flatness means that the non - trivial ` topological features ' of @xmath130 should all reside in a bounded region and not ` pile up ' at infinity .",
    "more formally this is expressed by saying that there is a bounded region @xmath138 such that @xmath139 ( the complement of @xmath140 ) consists of a finite number of disjoint pieces , each of which looks topologically like the complement of a ball in @xmath141 .",
    "these asymptotic pieces are also called the _ ends _ of the manifold @xmath130 .",
    "next comes the geometric restriction imposed by the condition of asymptotic flatness .",
    "it says that for each end there is an asymptotically euclidean coordinate - system @xmath142 in which the fields @xmath129 have the following fall - off for @xmath143 ( @xmath144 , @xmath145 ) @xmath146 moreover , in order to have convergent expressions for physically relevant quantities , like e.g. angular momentum ( see below ) , the field @xmath147 must be an _ even _ function of its argument , i.e. @xmath148 , and @xmath149 must be an _ odd _",
    "function , i.e. @xmath150 .    under these conditions each end can be assigned mass , momentum , and angular momentum , which are conserved during time evolution .",
    "they may be computed by integrals over 2-spheres in the limit the spheres are pushed to larger and larger radii into the asymptotically flat region of that end .",
    "these so - called adm - integrals ( first considered by arnowitt , deser , and misner in @xcite ) are given by the following expressions , which we give in ` geometric ' units ( meaning that in order to get them in standard units one has to multiply the mass expression given below by @xmath151 and the linear and angular momentum by @xmath152 ) : @xmath153      the constraints ( [ eq : ham - constraint ] , [ eq : mom - constraint ] ) are too complicated to be solved in general .",
    "further conditions are usually imposed to reduce the complexity of the problem : data @xmath129 are called _ maximal _ if @xmath154 . the name derives from the fact that @xmath155 is the necessary and sufficient condition for a hypersurface to have stationary volume to first order with respect to deformations in the ambient spacetime .",
    "even though stationarity does generally not imply extremality one calls such hypersurfaces maximal .",
    "note also that since spacetime is a lorentzian manifold , extremal spacelike hypersurfaces will be of maximal rather than minimal volume .",
    "in contrast , in riemannian manifolds one would speak of minimal surfaces .",
    "a much stronger condition is to impose @xmath156 , which as seen from ( [ eq : adm - momentum ] ) and ( [ eq : adm - angular - momentum ] ) implies that all momenta and angular momenta vanish . only the mass is now allowed to be non - zero .",
    "such data are called _ time - symmetric _ since for them @xmath109 is momentarily static as seen from ( [ eq : def - ext - curv ] ) .",
    "this implies that the evolution of such data into the future and into the past will coincide so that the developed spacetime will have a time - reversal symmetry which pointwise fixes the initial surface where @xmath156 .",
    "this surface is therefore also called the _ moment of time - symmetry_. time - symmetric data can still represent configurations of any number of black holes without angular momenta which are momentarily at rest .",
    "note also that for time - symmetric data the condition ( [ eq.def-apparent-horizon ] ) for an apparent horizon is equivalent to the tracelessness of the extrinsic curvature of @xmath134 . _",
    "hence for time symmetric data apparent horizons are minimal surfaces .",
    "_    we add one more general comment concerning submanifolds .",
    "a vanishing extrinsic curvature is equivalent to the property that each geodesic of the ambient space , which starts on , and tangent to , the submanifold , will always run entirely inside the submanifold .",
    "therefore , submanifolds with vanishing extrinsic curvature are called _ totally geodesic_. now , if the ambient space allows for an isometry ( symmetry of the metric ) , whose fixed - point set is the submanifold in question , like for the time - reversal transformation just discussed , the submanifold must necessarily be totally geodesic . to see this , consider a geodesic of the ambient space which starts on , and tangent to , the submanifold .",
    "assume that this geodesic eventually leaves the submanifold .",
    "then its image under the isometry would again be a geodesic ( since isometries always map geodesics to geodesics ) which is different from the one we started from .",
    "but this is impossible since they share the same initial conditions which are known to determine the geodesic uniquely .",
    "hence the geodesic can not leave the submanifold , which proves the claim .",
    "we will later have more opportunities to identify totally geodesic submanifolds  namely apparent horizons  by their property of being fixed - point sets of isometries .",
    "possibly the most popular approach to solving the constraints is the _ conformal technique _ due to york , lichnerowicz and others ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the basic idea is to regard the hamiltonian constraint ( [ eq : ham - constraint ] ) as equation for the conformal factor of the metric @xmath109 and _ freely _ specify the complementary information , called the conformal equivalence - class of @xmath109 .",
    "more concretely , this works as follows :    1 .",
    "choose unphysical ( ` hatted ' ) quantities @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is a riemannian metric on @xmath130 and @xmath159 is symmetric , trace and divergence free : @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath158 .",
    "2 .   solve the ( quasilinear elliptic ) equation for a positive , real valued function @xmath162 with boundary condition @xmath163 , where @xmath164 : @xmath165 3 .",
    "using the solution of ( [ eq : lichnerowicz ] ) , define physical ( ` unhatted ' ) quantities by @xmath166 _",
    "these will satisfy the constraints ( [ eq : ham - constraint ] , [ eq : mom - constraint ] ) ! _",
    "before we say a little more about maximal data we wish to present some of the most popular examples for time symmetric data some of which are also extensively used in numerical simulations .",
    "hopefully these examples let you gain some intuition in the geometries and topologies involved and also let you anticipate the richness that a variable space - structure gives to the solution space of one of the simplest equations in physics : the laplace equation .    restricting the solution strategy , outlined above , to the time - symmetric case one",
    "first observes that for @xmath156 one has @xmath167 .",
    "the momentum constraint ( [ eq : mom - constraint ] ) is automatically satisfied and all that remains is equation ( [ eq : lichnerowicz ] ) , which now simply becomes the laplace equation for the single scalar function @xmath162 on the riemannian manifold @xmath168 .",
    "we now make a further simplifying assumption , namely that @xmath158 is in fact the _ flat _ metric .",
    "this will restrict our solution @xmath109 to a _ conformally flat _ geometry .",
    "it is not obvious how severe the loss of physically interesting solutions is by restricting to conformally flat metrics .",
    "but we will see that the latter already contain many interesting and relevant examples .",
    "so let us solve laplace s equation in flat space ! remember that @xmath162 must be positive and approach 1 at spatial infinity ( asymptotic flatness ) .",
    "we can not take @xmath169 since the only solution to the laplace equation in @xmath141 which asymptotically approaches 1 is identically 1 .",
    "we must allow @xmath162 to blow up at some points , which we can then remove from the manifold . in this way we let the solution tell us what topology to choose in order to have an everywhere regular solution .",
    "you might think that just removing singular points would be rather cheating , since the resulting manifold may turn out to be incomplete , that is , can be hit by a curve after finite proper length ( you can go ` there ' ) , even though @xmath162 and hence the physical metric blows up at this point . if this were the case one definitely had to say what a solution on the completion would be .",
    "but , as a matter of fact , this can not happen and the punctured space will turn out to be complete in the physical metric .      the simplest solution with one puncture ( at @xmath170 ) is just @xmath171 where @xmath172 is a constant which we soon interpret and which must be positive in order for @xmath162 to be positive everywhere .",
    "we can not have other multipole contributions since they inevitably would force @xmath162 to be negative somewhere . what is the geometry of this solution ?",
    "the physical metric is @xmath173 which is easily checked to be invariant under the inversion - transformation on the sphere @xmath174 : @xmath175 this means that the region @xmath176 just looks like the region @xmath177 and that the sphere @xmath174 has the smallest area among all spheres of constant radius .",
    "it is a minimal surface , in fact even a totally geodesic submanifold , since it is the fixed point set of the isometry ( [ eq : inversion - trans ] ) .",
    "hence it is an apparent horizon , whose area follows from ( [ eq : metric - one - hole ] ) : @xmath178 our manifold thus corresponds to a black hole .",
    "its mass can easily be computed from ( [ eq : adm - mass ] ) ; one finds @xmath179 .",
    "this manifold has two ends , one for @xmath143 and one for @xmath180 .",
    "they have the same geometry and hence the same adm mass , as it must be the case since individual and total mass clearly coincide for a single hole .    the data just written down correspond to the ` middle ' slice right across the kruskal ( maximally extended schwarzschild ) manifold .",
    "also , ( [ eq : metric - one - hole ] ) is just the spatial part of the schwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates .",
    "hence we know its entire future development in analytic form .",
    "already for two holes this is not the case anymore .",
    "even the simplest two body problem  head - on collision has not been solved analytically in gr .",
    "there is an obvious generalization of ( [ eq : phi - one - hole ] ) by allowing two ` monopoles ' of strength @xmath181 and @xmath182 at the punctures @xmath183 and @xmath184 respectively .",
    "the 3-metric then reads @xmath185 the manifold has now three asymptotically flat ends , one for @xmath186 , where the overall adm mass @xmath0 is measured , and one each for @xmath187 . to see the latter , it is best to write the metric ( [ eq : metric - two - hole - schw ] ) in spherical polar coordinates @xmath188 centered at @xmath189 , and then introduce the inverted radial coordinate given by @xmath190 .",
    "in the limit @xmath191 the metric then takes the form @xmath192 where @xmath193 .",

    "the upper bound follows from the so - called penrose inequality in riemannian geometry ( proven in @xcite ) , which directly states that @xmath206 for each asymptotically flat end , where @xmath16 is the mass according to ( [ eq : adm - mass ] ) and @xmath207 is the area of the outermost ( as seen from that end ) minimal surface .    if the two holes approach each other to a distance comparable to the sizes of the holes the geometry changes in an essential way .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig:2bh - close ] .",
    "the most important new feature is that new minimal surfaces form , in fact two @xcite , which both enclose the two holes .",
    "the outermost of these , as seen from the upper end , denoted by @xmath208 in figure [ fig:2bh - close ] , corresponds to the apparent horizon of the newly formed ` compound ' black hole which contains the two old ones . for two black holes of equal mass",
    ", i.e. @xmath209 , this happens approximately for a parameter ratio of @xmath210 , which in an approximate numerical translation into the ratio of individual hole mass to geodesic separation reads @xmath211 .",
    "the method can be generalized in a straightforward manner to any number @xmath104 of black holes with parameters @xmath212 , @xmath213 , for the punctures .",
    "the manifold @xmath130 has now @xmath214 ends , one for @xmath186 and one for each @xmath215 .",
    "the expressions for the metric and masses are then given by the obvious generalizations of ( [ eq : metric - two - hole - schw ] ) and ( [ eq:2bh - masses ] ) respectively .",
    "loosely speaking , hawking s area law states that the surface of a black hole can not decrease with time .",
    "( see @xcite for a simple and complete outline of the traditional and technically slightly restricted version and @xcite for the technically most complete proof known today . )",
    "let us briefly explain this statement . if @xmath130 is a cauchy surface ( a spacelike hypersurface in spacetime ) and @xmath216 the event horizon ( a lightlike hypersurface in spacetime ) , the two intersect in a number of components ( spacelike 2-manifolds ) , each of which we assume to be a two - sphere .",
    "each such two - sphere is called the surface of a black hole at time @xmath130 .",
    "let us pick one of them and call it @xmath140 .",
    "consider next a second cauchy surface @xmath217 which lies to the future of @xmath130 .",
    "the outgoing null rays of @xmath140 intersect @xmath217 in a surface @xmath218 , and the statement is now that the area of @xmath218 is larger than or equal to the area of @xmath140 ( to prove this one must assume the strong energy condition ) .",
    "note that we deliberately left open the possibility that @xmath218 might be a proper subset of a black hole surface at time @xmath217 , namely in case the original hole has merged in the meantime with another one .",
    "if this does not happen @xmath218 may be called the surface of the _ same _ black hole at the later time @xmath130 .",
    "following an idea of hawking s @xcite , this can be applied to the future evolution of multi black hole data as follows . as we already mentioned",
    ", the event horizon lies on or outside the apparent horizon .",
    "hence the area of the ` surface ' ( as just defined ) of a black hole is bounded below by the area of the corresponding apparent horizon , which in turn has the lower bound stated in ( [ eq : area - bounds ] ) .",
    "suppose that after a long time our configuration settles in an approximately stationary state , at least for some interior region where no gravitational radiation is emitted anymore .",
    "since our data have zero linear and angular momentum , the final state is static and uniquely given by a single schwarzschild hole of some final mass @xmath219 and corresponding surface area @xmath220 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of known black hole uniqueness theorems ( see @xcite or p.  157 - 186 of @xcite for a summary ) . by the area theorem",
    "@xmath221 is not less than the sum of all initial apparent horizon surface areas .",
    "this immediately gives @xmath222 in passing we remark that applied to a single black hole this argument shows that it can not lose its mass below the value @xmath223 , called its _",
    "irreducible mass_. back to the multi - hole case , the total initial mass is given by the straightforward generalization of ( [ eq:2bh - masses ] ) : @xmath224 using these two equations we can write down a lower bound for the fractional energy loss into gravitational radiation : @xmath225 for a collision of @xmath104 initially widely separated ( @xmath226 ) holes of equal mass this becomes @xmath227 for just two holes this means that at most 29% of their total rest mass can be radiated away .",
    "but this efficiency can be enhanced if the energy is distributed over a larger number of black holes .",
    "another way to raise the upper bound for the efficiency is to consider spinning black holes . for two holes",
    "the maximal value of 50% can be derived by starting with two extremal black holes ( i.e. of maximal angular momentum : @xmath228 in geometric units ) which merge to form a single unspinning black hole @xcite .",
    "one can also envisage a situation where one hole participates in a scattering process but does not merge . rather it gets kicked out of the collision zone and settles without spin ( for simplicity ) in an quasistationary state ( for some time ) far apart .",
    "the question is what fraction of energy the area theorem allows it to lose .",
    "let this be the @xmath229th hole",
    ". then @xmath230 .",
    "hence @xmath231 showing that an appreciable efficiency can only be obtained if the data are such that @xmath232 is not too close to zero .",
    "this means that the @xmath233 hole was originally not too far from the others .",
    "this seems an unlikely process .",
    "hence it is difficult to extract energy from a single unspinning hole .    for a single spinning black hole",
    "the situation is again different .",
    "spinning it down from an extreme state to zero angular momentum sets an upper bound for the efficiency from the area law of 29% .",
    "this follows easily from the following relation between mass , irreducible mass , and angular momentum for a kerr black hole ( see e.g. @xcite , formula ( 33.60 ) ) : @xmath234 setting @xmath228 one solves for @xmath235 ; hence @xmath236 .",
    "it can moreover be shown @xcite that this limit can be ( theoretically ) realised by the penrose process ( compare frolov s lecture ) .",
    "needless to say that realistic processes may have far less efficiency than this theoretical bounds from the area law alone indicate .",
    "recent numerical studies of the head - on ( i.e. zero angular momentum ) collision of two equal - mass black holes give a radiated energy in units of the total energy of only @xmath237 @xcite . with angular momentum",
    "the efficiency is of course expected to be much better . here",
    "recent numerical investigations give an estimate of @xmath238 for an inspiral of two equal - mass non - spinning black holes from the innermost stable circular orbit @xcite : still a long way from the theoretical upper bound .",
    "other topologies can be found which support initial data with apparent horizons .",
    "for example , instead of the ` schwarzschild ' manifold with @xmath214 ends for @xmath104 black holes one can find one which has just two ends for any number @xmath239 of holes and which has been termed the einstein - rosen manifold @xcite .",
    "the difference to the data already discussed does not primarily lie in the physics they represent .",
    "after all their different topologies are hidden behind event horizons for the outside observer , even though their interaction energies are slightly different @xcite@xcite . however , the point we wish to stress here is that such data can analytically and numerically be more convenient , despite the fact that the underlying manifold might seem _ topologically _ more complicated .",
    "the reason is that these data have more symmetries , and that coordinate systems can be found for which these symmetries take simple analytic expressions . for example , in the einstein - rosen manifold the upper and lower ends are isometrically related by reflections about the minimal 2-spheres in each connecting tube , with the fixed - point sets being the apparent horizons . hence all the apparent horizons can analytically be easily located in the multi - hole einstein - rosen manifold , in contrast to the multi - hole schwarzschild manifold .",
    "r0.6    let us briefly explain this for two holes of equal mass . here one starts again from @xmath141 coordinatised by spherical bi - polar coordinates .",
    "these are obtained from bi - polar coordinates @xmath240 in the @xmath241 plane by adding an azimuthal angle @xmath242 corresponding to a rotation about the @xmath243 axis , just like ordinary spherical polar coordinates are produced from ordinary polar coordinates in the @xmath241-plane . the coordinates @xmath240 parametrise the @xmath241-plane according to @xmath244 , where @xmath245 and @xmath246 is a constant .",
    "the lines of constant @xmath247 intersect those of constant @xmath248 orthogonally .",

    "following an idea of misner @xcite , one can borrow the method of images from electrostatics ( see . e.g. chapter  2.1 in @xcite ) to construct solutions @xmath162 to the laplace equation such that the metric @xmath253 has a number of reflection isometries about two - spheres , one for each hole .",
    "in the two hole case one uses the two two - spheres @xmath254 for some @xmath255 , which then become the apparent horizons . using these isometries",
    "we can take two copies of our initial manifold , excise the balls @xmath256 and glue the two remaining parts ` back to back ' along the two boundaries @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",
    "the isometry - property is necessary so that the metric continues to be smooth across the seam .",
    "this gives an einstein - rosen manifold with two tubes ( or ` bridges ' , as they are sometimes called ) connecting two asymptotically flat regions .",
    "in fact , we could have just taken _ one _ copy of the original manifold , excised the balls @xmath256 , and _ mutually _ glued together the two boundaries @xmath254 .",
    "this also gives a smooth metric across the seam and results in a manifold known as the misner wormhole @xcite .",
    "metrically the misner wormhole is locally isometric to the einstein - rosen manifold with two tubes ( which is its ` double cover ' ) , but their topologies obviously differ .",
    "this means that for the observer outside the apparent horizons these two data sets are indistinguishable .",
    "this is not quite true for the einstein - rosen and schwarzschild data , which are not locally isometric . even without exploring the region inside the horizons (",
    "which anyway is rendered impossible by existing results on topological censorship  @xcite ) they slightly differ in their interaction energy and other geometric quantities , like e.g. the tidal deformation of the apparent horizons .    the two parameters @xmath13 and @xmath259 now label the two - hole configurations of equal mass .",
    "( in the schwarzschild case the two independent parameters were @xmath260 and @xmath261 . ) but unlike the schwarzschild case , we can now give not only closed analytic expressions for the total mass @xmath0 and individual mass @xmath16 in terms of the two parameters , but also for the geodesic distance of the apparent horizons @xmath17 .",
    "( @xmath17 is used as definition for ` instantaneous distance of the two black holes ' ; for the misner wormhole , where the two apparent horizons are identified , this corresponds to the length of the shortest geodesic winding once around the wormhole . )",
    "these read @xmath262 you might rightly wonder what ` individual mass ' should be if there is no internal end associated to each black hole where the adm - formula ( [ eq : adm - mass ] ) can be applied .",
    "the answer is that there are alternative definitions of ` quasi - local - mass ' which can be applied even without asymptotic ends .",
    "the one we used for the expression of @xmath16 above is due to lindquist @xcite and is easy to compute in connection with the method of images .",
    "but it is lacking a deeper mathematical foundation .",
    "an alternative which is mathematically better founded is due to penrose @xcite , which however is much harder to calculate and only applies to a limited set of situations ( it agrees with the adm mass whenever both definitions apply ) . amongst them are , however , all time - symmetric conformally flat data , and for the data above the penrose mass has fortunately been calculated in @xcite .",
    "the expression for @xmath16 is rather complicated and differs from that given above , though the difference is only of sixth order in an expansion in ( mass / distance ) @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we see that the problem of setting up initial data for two black holes of given individual mass and given separation has no unique answer .",
    "metrically as well as topologically different data sets can be found which have the same right to be called a realization of such a configuration . for holes without associated asymptotically flat",
    "ends no unambiguous definition for quasi - local mass exists .      according to a prescription found by bowen and york  @xcite",
    ", we can add linear and angular momentum within the setting of maximal data .",
    "we can still use _ conformally flat _ data , i.e. set @xmath263 , on multiply punctured @xmath141 .",
    "then the following two expressions add linear momentum @xmath264 and spin angular momentum @xmath265 to the puncture @xmath266 : @xmath267 it is straightforward to check that these expressions satisfy ( [ eq : hat - constraints ] ) ( note that @xmath268 )",
    ". one can also check that these data will indeed give the proposed momenta and angular momenta at infinity ( i.e. at the end @xmath143 ) .",

    "linearity of all these equations in @xmath270 allows us to just add @xmath271 and @xmath272 and get initial data for one black hole with given momentum @xmath273 and ( spin ) angular momentum @xmath274 .",

    "in this final section we draw attention to some of the current problems and developments , without claiming completeness .",
    "1 .   given black hole data for @xmath104 holes of fixed masses and mutual separations ( whatever definitions one uses here ) .",
    "one would like to minimize these data on the amount of outgoing radiation energy .",
    "any excess over the minimal amount can be said to be ` already contained ' initially .",
    "but so far no local ( in time ) criterion is known which quantifies the amount of gravitational radiation in an initial data set .",
    "first hints at the possibility that some ( newman - penrose ) conserved quantities could be useful here were discussed in @xcite .",
    "2 .   restricting to spatially conformally flat metrics seems to be too narrow .",
    "it has been shown that there are no conformally flat spatial slices in kerr spacetime which are axisymmetric and reduce to slices of constant schwarzschild time in the limit of vanishing angular momentum @xcite .",
    "accordingly , bowen - york data , even for a single black hole , contain excess gravitational radiation due to the relaxation of the individual holes to kerr form @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for an informal discussion of this and related problems .",
    "an alternative to the bowen - york data which describe two spinning black holes and which reduce to kerr data if the mass of one hole goes to zero have been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "3 .   even for the most simple 2-hole data ( schwarzschild or einstein - rosen )",
    "it is not known whether the evolving spacetime will have a suitably smooth asymptotic structure at future - lightlike infinity ( i.e. ` scri - plus ' ) . as a consequence",
    ", we still do not know whether we can give a rigorous mathematical meaning to the notion of ` energy loss by gravitational radiation ' in this case of the simplest head - on collision of two black holes !",
    "the difficult analytical problems involved are studied in the framework of the so - called ` conformal field equations ' .",
    "see @xcite ( in particular section  4 ) for a summary and references .",
    "4 .   we usually like to ask ` newtonian ' questions , like : given two black holes of individual masses @xmath201 and mutual separation @xmath17 , what is their binding energy ?",
    "for such a question to make sense we need good concepts of _ quasi - local mass _ and _ distance_. but these are ambiguous concepts in gr .",
    "different definitions of ` quasi - local mass ' and ` distance ' amount to differences in the calculated binding energies which can be a few @xmath237 times total energy at closest encounter @xcite .",
    "this is of the same order of magnitude as the total energy lost into gravitational radiation found in @xcite for head - on ( i.e. zero angular momentum ) collision of two black holes modelled with misner data .",
    "by the ` energy principle ' we understand the property , that _ all _ energy of the self - gravitating system serves as source for the gravitational field . in this appendix",
    "we wish to prove that ( [ eq : mod - poisson - eq ] ) indeed satisfies this principle . for the uniqueness argument see @xcite .    given a matter distribution @xmath20 immersed in its own gravitational potential @xmath18 .",
    "suppose we redistribute the matter within a bounded region of space by actively dragging it along the flow lines of a vector field @xmath315 which vanishes outside some bounded region .",
    "the rate of change , @xmath316 , of the matter distribution is then determined through @xmath317 , where @xmath318 is the lie derivative with respect to @xmath315 and @xmath319 is the standard spatial volume element .",
    "note that the latter also needs to be differentiated along @xmath315 , resulting in @xmath320 .",
    "hence we have @xmath321 .",
    "the rate of work done to the system during this process is @xmath322 where the integration by parts does not lead to surface terms due to @xmath315 vanishing outside a bounded region",
    ". equation ( [ eq : app1 ] ) is still completely general , that is , independent of the field equation for @xmath18 .",
    "the field equation comes in when we assume that the process of redistribution is carried out adiabatically , which means that at each stage during the process @xmath18 satisfies its field equation with the instantaneous matter distribution .",
    "our claim will be proven if under the hypothesis that @xmath18 satisfies ( [ eq : mod - poisson - eq ] ) we can show that @xmath323 , where @xmath41 is defined in ( [ eq : grav - mass ] ) and represents the total gravitating energy according to the field equation . setting @xmath324 and using the more convenient equation ( [ eq : linearization ] ) , we have @xmath325    = \\frac{c^4}{2\\pi g}\\int_{\\reals^3 } dv\\ ,      \\left[\\psi\\delta(\\delta\\psi)-(\\delta\\psi)\\delta\\psi\\right ]      \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{c^4}{2\\pi g}\\,\\lim_{r\\rightarrow\\infty}\\int_{s^2(r ) } d\\sigma\\ ,      \\vec n\\cdot\\left[\\psi\\vec\\nabla(\\delta\\psi)-                      ( \\vec\\nabla\\psi)\\delta\\psi\\right]\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : app2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , the fall - off condition for @xmath143 imply that @xmath326 falls off as fast as @xmath327 and @xmath328 as @xmath269 .",
    "hence the second term in the last line of ( [ eq : app2 ] ) does not contribute so that we may reverse its sign .",
    "this leads to @xmath329 which proves the claim .",
