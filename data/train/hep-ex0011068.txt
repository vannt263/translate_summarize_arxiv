    "several fundamental aspects of the standard model@xcite , such as the number of families and the fermion masses could be explained naturally in composite models where leptons and quarks have substructure@xcite .",
    "the existence of excited leptons is a typical consequence of these models .",
    "the excited leptons @xmath3 and @xmath4 were extensively searched for at the lep@xcite collider .",
    "first generation excited leptons were also searched for at the hera@xcite @xmath5 collider .",
    "the increase of the lep centre - of - mass energy , @xmath6 , up to @xmath0 in 1999 extends the range of potential discovery of new heavy particles .",
    "the interactions of excited leptons are studied within a model@xcite that assumes spin 1/2 , and isospin doublets with left and right handed components : @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "excited leptons are expected to decay into their ground states by radiating a photon ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , via charged - current decay ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) or via weak neutral - current decay ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) .    at  colliders ,",
    "excited leptons can be produced either in pairs ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) or singly ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) . in pair production ,",
    "the coupling of the excited leptons to the gauge bosons is described by the effective lagrangian : @xmath20 here @xmath21 are the dirac matrices , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the standard model su(2 ) and u(1 ) coupling constants , @xmath24 denotes the pauli matrices , @xmath25 is the hypercharge , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the gauge fields associated with the su(2 ) and u(1 ) groups respectively .",
    "the couplings of excited leptons to the gauge bosons are fixed by their quantum numbers , and thus the cross section for pair production depends only on the mass of the excited lepton and the centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the single production of excited leptons as well as their decay are described by means of an effective lagrangian of the form : @xmath28 where @xmath29 $ ] , @xmath30 is the scale of new physics and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the couplings associated with su(2 ) and u(1 ) respectively .",
    "the production rate of single excited leptons depends on their mass , @xmath6 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . for a given mass and centre - of - mass energy ,",
    "the polar angle distribution is determined by the relative value of the couplings @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the decay fractions of excited leptons into standard leptons plus gauge bosons are also determined by the relative value of @xmath31 and @xmath32@xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : bratio ] shows the branching ratios for two choices of @xmath31 and @xmath32 and for different excited lepton masses .",
    "pair production searches are sensitive to excited leptons of mass up to values close to the kinematic limit , _",
    "i.e. _ the beam energy , @xmath35 .",
    "searches for single production extend the sensitivity to the mass range above the beam energy up to the centre - of - mass energy .    in the case of single production of excited electrons ,",
    "the polar angle distribution depends critically on the relative values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . if @xmath36 , the @xmath37-channel photon exchange gives a large contribution at low polar angle with the electron escaping through the beam pipe . if @xmath38 , the @xmath39 vertex is not allowed , and only the @xmath40 mediated @xmath41- and @xmath37-channels contribute , giving rise to events with an electron visible in the detector .",
    "thus , the efficiency for @xmath42 selection is calculated for both scenarios : @xmath36 and @xmath38 . for all other flavours of excited leptons ,",
    "the detection efficiency depends only slightly on the coupling assumption .",
    "the data sample analysed was collected in 1999 with the l3 detector@xcite at four different centre - of - mass energies , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , with corresponding integrated luminosities of 29.7 @xmath1 , 83.7 @xmath1 , 82.8 @xmath1 and 37.0 @xmath1 .",

    "pair produced excited leptons are generated with a mass of @xmath54 which is close to the expected limits . in the case of single production , excited leptons with masses 100 , 150 and @xmath55 are generated , and a linear interpolation is used to estimate the selection efficiency for masses in the range from 90 to @xmath2 .",

    "time dependent inefficiencies , as monitored during the data taking period , are reproduced in these simulations .",
    "the selection of candidate events for excited lepton production is performed with criteria similar to those used at @xmath56@xcite , for the most significant experimental signatures .",
    "these criteria are modified to follow the evolution of the signal topology , that manifests a larger boost of the decay particles with the higher @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , some new selections are performed to complement the search in decay channels which were not investigated previously .",
    "all selections are based on the identification of the decay products of the excited leptons .",

    "photons must be isolated whereas electrons must be associated to a charged track . in order to be well inside the angular acceptance of the central tracking chamber ,",
    "the polar angle of electrons and photons must satisfy @xmath58 .",
    "muons are reconstructed either from tracks in the muon spectrometer pointing to the interaction vertex and in time with the event , or via energy depositions in the calorimeters consistent with a minimum ionising particle .",
    "tau leptons are reconstructed from low multiplicity hadronic jets , or from identified electrons or muons .",
    "the neutrino from the tau decay carries away part of the energy , giving rise to events with missing energy along the tau direction . in some selections where a kinematic fit is applied ,",
    "this signature is imposed by requiring the fitted energy of the tau to be greater than the visible energy of the corresponding jet or lepton .    to reduce the background from the radiative return to the z and from two - photon interactions , the missing momentum is required to point away from the beam axis in most of the selections .",
    "the discovery potential is maximised for the topologies in which it is possible to reconstruct the invariant mass of the excited leptons .",
    "pair production and single production of excited leptons are discussed below .",
    "the search for pair produced excited leptons is optimised for excited leptons of masses close to the kinematic limit .",
    "for excited leptons of mass up to @xmath59 , the neutral - current decay branching ratio is always below 15% , and depends on the mass and the relative value of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "thus , only the radiative and the charged - current decays are considered .",
    "the production cross section can reach a few pb , depending on the excited lepton mass . for example at @xmath60 and an excited lepton mass of @xmath54 , the cross section for pair production is 1.1 pb for @xmath61 and 0.7 pb for @xmath62 .",
    "table  [ tab : selections ] lists the selections and summarises the efficiencies and the number of events found in data and expected from standard model background processes .",
    "the relative importance of the selections is given by the coupling assumption .",
    "the radiative decays @xmath10 and @xmath11 provide the maximum sensitivity in the @xmath36 and the @xmath38 scenarios respectively .",
    "event selection for the @xmath63 process requires low multiplicity events with two photons and two same flavour charged leptons . to reduce the background from radiative dilepton production , at least one of the photons is required to lie in the central region of the detector ( @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the photon polar angle ) . after a kinematic fit , which imposes energy and momentum conservation , the difference of the lepton - photon invariant masses",
    "is required to be smaller than @xmath66 and their sum greater than @xmath59 .",

    "there should be no tracks in the central tracker nor in the muon spectrometer , and the energy of any other calorimetric cluster should be less than @xmath70 .",
    "the background from the @xmath71 process is efficiently reduced by requiring the photon acoplanarity to be greater than @xmath72 .",
    "the charged - current decays @xmath12 and @xmath13 are dominant in the @xmath38 and the @xmath36 scenarios respectively .",
    "final states from @xmath73 are experimentally similar to standard model w pair production . to achieve a high signal efficiency , pair production of excited leptons",
    "is searched for as an enhancement of the w pair - like event rate .",
    "a combination of four selections , named @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , selects such events .    for the @xmath74 selection ,",
    "events with at least three hadronic jets and visible energy greater than @xmath78 are selected . for at least one pair of jets",
    ", their invariant mass must be in the range between @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the recoiling mass against these two jets must be greater than @xmath79 and the sum of invariant plus recoil masses must be greater than @xmath81 .",

    ", visible energy below @xmath84 and an isolated lepton are retained .",
    "the invariant mass of the hadronic system must be compatible with the w mass . in the @xmath77 selection ,",

    "figure  [ fig : pair]b shows the hadronic invariant mass for the @xmath82 selected events .",
    "the experimental signatures of the process @xmath87 are also similar to standard model w pair production .",
    "thus , the @xmath74 and @xmath82 selections described above are used to investigate them . moreover , in the @xmath88 and @xmath89 channels , the final state leptons may be detected , providing a very clean signature .",
    "therefore , for these channels the signal sensitivity is enhanced by requiring two additional isolated electrons or muons in the event , with energy in the range between @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the processes @xmath92 and @xmath93 give rise to events with an energetic photon , a lepton , and the decay products of a w boson . both the hadronic and the leptonic decays of the w",

    "the additional criteria for each final state are discussed below .    in the @xmath94 and @xmath95 channels , an energetic electron or muon",
    "is required . moreover , the sum of the invariant and recoil masses of the lepton - photon pair , _",
    "i.e. _ the masses of the @xmath61 candidates , must be greater than @xmath96 and their difference smaller than @xmath66 in the electron case and @xmath83 in the muon case . figures  [ fig : pair]c and d show the @xmath97 and @xmath98 invariant masses for the selected events . for the signal distributions , @xmath36 is assumed to set the branching ratios .    for the @xmath99 and @xmath100 channels , a low multiplicity jet ,",
    "an electron or a muon must be present .",
    "in high multiplicity events , the signature of a w boson is imposed by requiring the invariant mass of the hadronic system to be in the range from @xmath101 to @xmath59 , whereas low multiplicity events must contain only the photon and no more than two leptons . for the @xmath99 channel ,",
    "the invariant mass and the energy of the @xmath102 system correspond to the @xmath103 mass and the beam energy , respectively .",
    "this signature is used by requiring the recoil mass of the tau - photon system to exceed @xmath104 , and the visible energy of the rest of the event to be smaller than @xmath81 . for the @xmath100 channel , after excluding the photon , the visible energy of the rest of the event must be smaller than @xmath81 and @xmath105 for the hadronic and leptonic decays of the w respectively .",
    "the search for singly produced excited leptons complements the search for pair production in the mass range from @xmath35 to @xmath6 .",

    ", at least one of the two possible @xmath107 invariant masses must be greater than @xmath105 .",
    "events with just an identified electron and a photon , with invariant mass above @xmath105 , are also accepted for the excited electron selection .",
    "thus , a high signal efficiency is kept for the signal events originating from the @xmath37-channel photon exchange where one electron escapes along the beam pipe .",
    "figures  [ fig : rad]a - c show all combinations of lepton - photon invariant masses above @xmath108 . final states from @xmath109 are selected by requiring a single photon with energy greater than @xmath110 at high polar angle @xmath64 .",

    "the @xmath82 selections described above are applied . however , in order to be sensitive to charged excited leptons with mass close to the w mass , and to excited neutrinos with mass close to @xmath6 , where the final state neutrino carries low momentum , no cuts on the missing momentum or visible energy are applied .",

    "for some signatures of excited leptons , a sizable signal efficiency is achieved with very low background , giving sensitivity to production cross sections as low as 0.1 pb . for each flavour of excited lepton",
    ", all selections are combined to derive an upper limit to the signal cross section , taking into account the luminosity , the branching fractions and the efficiencies .",
    "the results from the four centre - of - mass energies analysed are presented together , but are treated separately for the calculation of limits , as the signal cross sections depend on @xmath6 .",
    "these combinations include the results from @xmath56@xcite .",
    "the limit is set at 95% confidence level , using bayesian statistics and assuming a flat positive _ a priori _ distribution for the signal cross section .",
    "two different scenarios are considered in order to present limits . in the first one ,",
    "@xmath36 , the radiative decay is allowed for charged excited leptons whereas it is forbidden for excited neutrinos . in the second one , @xmath38 ,",
    "the situation is the opposite : the radiative decay is forbidden for charged excited leptons and is allowed for excited neutrinos .    in the case of pair production ,",
    "lower mass limits are derived from the cross section upper bounds .",
    "a scan is performed for all the possible relative values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . for each value ,",

    "[ tab : limits ] the limits corresponding to the @xmath36 and @xmath38 scenarios are presented together with the lowest limit obtained in the scan . this limit corresponds to the ratio of the couplings @xmath126 that , given the signal efficiencies and the number of expected candidates , maximise the compatibility of the data with the existence of excited leptons .",
    "the lowest mass limits correspond to the branching ratios that , given the signal efficiencies and the number of expected candidates , maximise the compatibility of the data with the existence of excited leptons .    in the case of single production searches , an upper limit to the cross section",

    "figure  [ fig : limites ] shows the upper limits to the effective coupling @xmath127 for charged excited leptons and excited neutrinos for the @xmath36 and @xmath38 scenarios .",
    "the left - hand edge of the curves indicates the lower mass limit derived from pair production searches whereas the rise of the curves in the high excited lepton mass region reflects the lack of experimental sensitivity due to the low expected signal cross section .",
    "the limits corresponding to charged excited leptons in the @xmath36 scenario and excited neutrinos in the @xmath38 scenario are derived mainly from the radiative decay searches , highly sensitive to the signal .",
    "these limits are therefore more stringent than the limits obtained in the complementary scenarios in which the radiative decays are forbidden .",
    "moreover , the limits corresponding to excited leptons of the first generation are significantly lower due to the higher cross section explained by the @xmath37-channel contribution .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are conservatively taken into account for the limit calculations by lowering the background expectation and the signal efficiency in all the selections .",
    "a variation close to 2.6% in the background , depending on the selection , accounts for the uncertainties related to background cross sections , limited monte carlo statistics , detector simulation and selection efficiency .",
    "a similar variation in the signal efficiency accounts for the uncertainties coming from signal monte carlo statistics , the extrapolation to different centre - of - mass energies and excited lepton masses and detector simulation . the effect of systematics is quite significant for the limits extracted from high statistics selections , as in the case of @xmath128 in the @xmath36 scenario .    in conclusion ,",
