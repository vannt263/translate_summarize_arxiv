    "when studying gauge / gravity dualities , one may encounter singularities in the supergravity geometry .",
    "some of these singularities are acceptable , in the sense of having a physical understanding such as the location of a source ( , a brane ) in the geometry .",
    "others are unphysical , and signal a failure of supergravity to capture crucial features of the situation , such as physics of the underlying short  distance theory .",
    "one mechanism for resolving such singularities that has appeared in this context is the `` enhanon '' mechanism , so called because the prototype example@xcite was accompanied by the appearance of extra massless states giving rise to enhanced gauge symmetry in spacetime .",
    "the entire supergravity solution came from wrapping many bps d6branes on k3 , and the dangerous `` repulson''@xcite singularities are associated to a region of repulsive geometry , whose behaviour is inconsistent with the 1/4bps nature of the configuration .",
    "the resolution of the geometry s singularities was to simply excise the region which was behaving poorly and replace it with flat space .",
    "the physics behind this is the fact that all of the branes making up the solution cease to be pointlike and smear out to form a spherical shell called the `` enhanon '' , of radius @xmath7 , which is larger than the radius , @xmath8 of the repulson singularity .",
    "( see figure  [ sphere ] . )",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the wrapped branes also play the role of bps monopoles charged under the @xmath9 arising from reduction of the superstring theory on the k3 s volume cycle . in supergravity , at radius  @xmath7 the k3 s volume reaches the value at which an effective higgs vacuum expectation value vanishes and the @xmath9 is restored to @xmath10 . as bps monopoles , there is no problem finding an approximately spherical configuration .",
    "the deviation from this spherical symmetry should be subleading in a @xmath11 expansion@xcite . ]",
    ", the d6branes accordingly smear out , and become massless , forming the enhanon shell .",
    "since there are no longer any point sources inside  @xmath7 , the spacetime geometry is well approximated by flat space .",
    "the resulting complete geometry is well  behaved , possessing the correct physical properties to match certain gauge theory phenomena expected from the world ",
    "volume theory on the branes , such as the metric on moduli space .",
    "the configuration has eight supercharges , which is enough to have a moduli space , but not so much as to force it to be trivially flat .    the proposal to excise the bad region and replace it with flat space , while a natural one , might have seemed considerably drastic from other points of view , and one might ask whether it is a consistent procedure from the purely supergravity perspective : since the enhanced gauge symmetry is a purely stringy phenomenon , is there any sense in which the excision procedure is natural in supergravity ? after doing a purely supergravity analysis@xcite",
    ", the satisfying answer is that the excision is not only allowed by the supergravity ( in fact , one can perform it at any radius greater than @xmath7 in that spherical case and get sensible results ) , but it is extremely natural to carry it out at the enhanon radius .",
    "the reason is as follows : one glues the exterior geometry onto the new interior ( flat space ) and any mismatch in the extrinsic curvatures of the geometries across the junction acts as a source in the theory , which in this case would be the smeared shell of branes .",
    "the analysis of ref.@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) showed that the shell of branes was in fact massless at the enhanon radius , consistent with the superstring expectations given above .",
    "furthermore , the enhanon radius was the _ most economical _ place at which to perform the excision , since that radius also coincided with the outermost reaches of the unphysical repulsive interior region , as could be seen by probing with ordinary supergravity test particles .    while this special spherically symmetric situation is compelling , it is interesting to find more examples , and explore the nature of the mechanism in greater detail .",
    "the spherical symmetry is quite seductive , and it is easy to forget that there should be nothing particularly special about that symmetry .",
    "after all , the @xmath12 constituent branes are bps , and so in fact as long as we do not develop any unphysical regions , _ very many _",
    "shapes should be possible , and for large @xmath12 , almost _ any _ shape is imaginable .",
    "the difficulty is of course in finding supergravity techniques which facilitate the exhibition of solutions describing the non",
    " trivial shapes that we can imagine .",
    "for this project we set out to do the most simple bps deviation from the sphere we could think of , which was to deform to an oblate situation , and perhaps work perturbatively away from the spherical situation . to our surprise ,",
    "the result was much richer than we could have hoped for .",
    "we succeed in describing a complete family of axially symmetric geometries , parametrised by a parameter  @xmath13 .",
    "it transpires that there is a critical value , @xmath14 , separating two distinct physical situations .",
    "the reader should refer to figure  [ loci ] ( on page  ) which illustrates the following descriptions :    * for @xmath15 , the enhanon locus is disconnected : there is an outer shell and an inner shell , with non  trivial supergravity inside the inner shell .",
    "the region between the two shells is unphysical in the naive geometry and is excised and replaced by flat space , while the region inside the inner shell is perfectly well  behaved , and so remains . for increasing @xmath13",
    "the outer shell becomes more depressed at the poles , forming an oblate shape , while the inner shell reaches increasingly outwards towards the poles .",
    "* even more remarkably , perhaps , for @xmath16 , the two enhanon shells join , and the enhanon is no longer disconnected . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the complete enhanc con locus is in fact a torus .",
    "the torus flattens increasingly for greater @xmath18 see also figure  ( [ notsphere ] ) . *",
    "another choice which can be made for @xmath19 is to excise the entire interior , leaving the oblate shape outside , and flat space in the entire interior region .",
    "remarkably , the supergravity excision technology is tractable in this situation , and confirms that these are physically sensible choices .    in this paper",
    "we report on this interesting and highly non ",
    "trivial example of supergravity geometry as an exhibit of the enhanon mechanism at work , and as a study which allows us to learn more about certain brane configurations . in section  [ distribution ] , we study first a generalised six  brane supergravity solution which corresponds to a disc distribution of d6branes .",
    "such branes are the nicest geometries to wrap on k3 , since the remaining transverse geometry has three spatial dimensions .",
    "this means that the resulting geometry is easy to visualise , and , at a deeper level , much of the mathematics is quite familiar , as we shall see .",
    "there are two useful coordinate systems which are employed here to uncover aspects of the geometry in the wrapped case , and it is worthwhile exploring them in the unwrapped case .",
    "the unwrapped case itself is interesting , and we compare it to expressions that we derive for other d  brane disc distributions .",
    "we should make a cautionary note , however .",
    "it is useful to describe these solutions in terms of a continuous density of branes .",
    "while this is a simplification , ( since branes come in discrete amounts due to charge quantisation ) , it is a good and useful approximation at large @xmath12 .",
    "however , the d6brane disc distribution that we find has the strange feature that the density function in the interior of the disc is in fact negative , which is hard to interpret .",
    "however , we are able to characterise the behaviour resulting from this strange feature and do not discard the solution , for at least three reasons :    * apart from the negative density itself , there is no compelling reason to think that there might not be yet to be found some beyond  supergravity means of explaining the role of such a geometry , perhaps involving something analogous to the enhanon mechanism . *",
    "the negative density has _ nothing _ to do with the repulson geometry arising from wrapping , which is what we really want to study in this paper .",
    "we need not `` throw out the baby with the bathwater '' , and can carry out a _ separate _ discussion of the wrapping and its associated features , including the enhanon mechanism .",
    "the features associated to this negative density are clearly isolated in the discussion and do not play any role . *",
    "the d5 and d4brane distributions which we also display have no such strange behaviour , and the subsequent discussion of the appearance of the repulson after wrapping and its resolution by the enhanon is similar in spirit to the d6brane case we study in detail first . even if the d6brane example we study here does not turn out to be salvageable in its entirety",
    ", we will see that the key features survive in these better  behaved examples .    in short",
    ", we can use the d6brane case as a ( rather pretty ) simple model , and be aware of the negative density , but not distracted by it , leaving its understanding for another day .",
    "we also exhibit the fact that the behaviour of the harmonic functions corresponding to the distribution has a beautiful expansion in terms of legendre polynomials .",
    "recalling that the moduli space of the wrapped brane system is isomorphic to that of the coulomb branch of the @xmath20 supersymmetric @xmath21dimensional pure @xmath0 gauge theory , this will yield a useful geometrical parametrisation of the vacuum expectation values of operators made from the symmetric product of the three adjoint scalars in the gauge multiplet , an issue we return to in section  [ gaugetheory ] .    in section  [ wrapping ]",
    "we uncover the properties of the wrapped system , seeking the repulson and enhanon loci , and characterising them , displaying the equations which result in figures  [ loci ] and  [ notsphere ] .",
    "we probe the supergravity solution with wrapped branes and point particles , in order to discover the nature of the unphysical regions of the geometry .",
    "we then perform the excision to construct new geometries which are free of the repulson regions arising from the wrapping , checking consistency in supergravity in section  [ excision ] . in section",
    "[ others ] we discuss some features of wrapped d4 and d5brane distributions .",
    "section [ gaugetheory ] extracts some gauge theory results from the d6brane case .",
    "we conclude with some remarks in section  [ conclude ] .",
    "it is possible to derive a metric for a continuous distribution of branes by taking extremal limits of rotating solutions .",
    "the limits remove the rotation and restore supersymmetry , and the parameters that corresponded to rotation remain in the geometry as parameters of the distribution ( for d3branes this was done first in refs.@xcite ) .",
    "we can do this here for d6branes as follows : the rotating black six ",
    "brane solution , in the usual supergravity conventions , is given by ",
    "brane solutions of type  ii supergravity have been found in refs.@xcite by uplifting of rotating black hole solutions of various types . ] : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 while @xmath25 is a radial coordinate for three cartesian coordinates @xmath26 with @xmath27 and we are using standard spherical polar coordinates such that @xmath28 , and so on .",
    "we can obtain an extremal limit by sending the non  extremality parameter @xmath29 and the boost parameter @xmath30 , while keeping @xmath31 fixed . in this limit the metric component , @xmath32 , giving rise to rotation does not survive and the resulting solution is : @xmath33 where @xmath34 this can be done for the other solutions presented in refs.@xcite as well , giving distributions of other d@xmath35branes , and we refer to some of the results of this later .",
    "the normalisation @xmath36 gives @xmath12 units of d6brane charge , @xmath37 , in the standard units  @xcite .",
    "in the next section we wrap this configuration of d6branes on k3 .",
    "however , let us first examine the structure of this configuration , in order to understand better what new features are specifically brought about by the wrapping , and which are due to the distribution s geometry .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 controls the departure from a spherical geometry . in the case",
    "@xmath38 , the solution in equation  ( [ d6metric - oldcoordinates ] ) reduces to the usual spherically symmetric static d6brane solution@xcite , where the singularity at @xmath39 is interpreted as the position where the branes reside .",
    "now , as soon as @xmath40 , that singularity disappears except for on the equatorial plane @xmath41 : the denominator in the harmonic function is now @xmath42 , which only vanishes at @xmath43 , so the source at @xmath39 has been modified .",
    "let us try to understand how .    to get a better understanding of the source ,",
    "let us perform the following transformation@xcite to isotropic coordinates which we shall refer to as `` extended '' : @xmath44 we see that the origin @xmath39 is mapped to a disc , given by @xmath45 , @xmath46 . going to @xmath39 along @xmath47 takes us to the centre of the disc at @xmath48 , while an approach along @xmath41 takes us to the edge of the disc at @xmath49 .",
    "approaching along other angles takes us to the interior of the disc .",
    "the metric in equation  ( [ d6metric - oldcoordinates ] ) reduces to a standard brane form : @xmath50 where the harmonic function is given by @xmath51 with @xmath52 now we see that the singularity we identified earlier is in fact a _ ring _ of radius @xmath13 .",
    "is this where the branes are located ?",
    "the harmonic function @xmath53 should have an integral representation given schematically by @xmath54 for some density function @xmath55 representing a continuous distribution of branes in the coordinate  @xmath56 .",
    "how seriously we should take the physical meaning of this distribution is a matter of interest . for many applications , of concern to supergravity quantities ,",
    "the meaning of a continuous distribution of branes should not be a problem , but we must remember that in the full string theory , we might wish to probe the structure of the solution at resolutions which might render the distribution meaningless .",
    "it is possible to directly determine the distribution s dependence on @xmath56 , using an analogue of gauss law . for six",
    " branes , we have three transverse spatial dimensions , and so the problem of determining harmonic functions is in fact directly translated into an undergraduate electromagnetism problem .",
    "let us define @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "it is sufficient to determine the harmonic function s behaviour along the @xmath59axis .",
    "the density function and the angular dependence of @xmath53 follows directly from harmonic analysis .",
    "the analogue of gauss law in electrodynamics for a standard infinitesimal `` pillbox '' surface defined on the @xmath60 plane is : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the unit normal vector of the surface directed from one side ( @xmath63 ) to the other side  ( @xmath64 ) of the surface , and @xmath65 is the surface charge density .",
    "the electric field is @xmath66 , while the role of the potential @xmath67 is now played by the harmonic function .",
    "taking the derivative , @xmath68 we obtain @xmath69 where an expansion in small @xmath59 was used to get this result .",
    "this density is negative , but happily ( since it would be hard to see how to get a positive result for the d6brane charge from this ) , it integrates to infinity over the disc , due to the boundary contribution .",
    "we must therefore add an extra positive term to the boundary , so that the complete distribution is @xmath70 it is worth checking that the normalisation of the configuration is indeed @xmath71 as expected @xmath72_{\\rho=0}^{\\rho=\\ell } + \\left.\\frac{r_6 \\rho}{\\sqrt{\\ell^2 - \\rho^2 } } \\right|_{\\rho=\\ell }   =   r_6\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and that the brane distribution ( [ d6density ] ) correctly reproduces our harmonic function along the @xmath59axis : @xmath73_{\\rho=0}^{\\rho=\\ell } + \\left.\\frac{r_6 \\rho}{\\sqrt{z^2+\\rho^2}\\sqrt{\\ell^2 - \\rho^2 } } \\right|_{\\rho=\\ell }   =   1 + \\frac{r_6 z}{\\ell^2 + z^2}\\ .{\\label{theform}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is very interesting , particularly when compared to the results ( listed in equation  ( [ more ] ) ) one can get by computing the analogous quantities for d@xmath35brane disc distributions for @xmath74 .",
    "the results are easy to obtain @xmath0 gauge theory@xcite . ] by noting first that along the @xmath59 axis , the harmonic function s form in extended coordinates is exactly the same as in unextended coordinates : @xmath75 this can be verified by simply examining the appropriate metrics , which can be derived by taking an extremal limit of the metrics listed in @xcite , as we did for equation  ( [ rotating ] ) to get equation  ( [ d6metric - oldcoordinates ] ) , keeping only one non ",
    "zero parameter @xmath76 .",
    "given that the harmonic function should have an integral representation @xmath77 it is easy to guess the densities in each case and check them by explicit integration .",
    "we list the densities here , and plot them in figure  [ distributions ] : @xmath78 ( now @xmath59 in the above is shorthand for all of the directions transverse to the disc and , of course , to the brane s world  volume . )",
    "the pattern is amusing . for a d@xmath35brane ,",
    "as @xmath35 becomes larger , the distribution increasingly spreads away from the centre .",
    "the d5brane case is a limiting one , having all of the branes at the boundary forming a ring .",
    "the d6brane case ( not plotted ) also has a @xmath79function on the boundary , but is accompanied by a negative contribution to @xmath55 in the interior .",
    "while there is a striking pattern here , we must pause to consider what the physical significance of the negative contribution to the distribution of branes might be @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "there , switching on a vacuum expectation value of a perfectly physical operator in the gauge theory corresponded to a five dimensional ball distribution , which by happy coincidence is described by the same function as we have listed above for the d6brane disc . ] . as we said previously",
    ", we must be careful about the meaning of the continuous distribution in general , since it is merely a supergravity approximation .",
    "however , the negative density ( and hence tension and charge ) is somewhat harder to accept , and may be another cry for help from the supergravity , appealing to more stringy physics to resolve the problem .",
    "this is of course reminiscent of the features which are resolved by the enhanon mechanism .",
    "there is a region where branes seem to have negative tension . in that case@xcite",
    "this was seen by sending in a probe brane of the same type to the affected region .",
    "the supergravity geometry in the interior was consequently discarded because one could argue that it can not be constructed by bringing all of the constituent branes from infinity .",
    "we can _ not _ apply that reasoning here , however .",
    "a probe d6brane will again see no potential for movement in this background , and the resulting moduli space metric is perfectly flat right down to @xmath48 .",
    "so it would seem that we can not argue in this way that we ca nt construct this supergravity solution .",
    "later , we will also see that this sort of distribution corresponds to switching on apparently sensible vacuum expectation values for gauge theory operators .",
    "that discussion will be aided by noting that the harmonic function @xmath53 can be expanded in a series in the variable @xmath80 for @xmath81 , or @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "it is delightful to see how these series arrange themselves in terms of legendre polynomials : @xmath84 where we have defined new polar coordinate angles with respect to the @xmath85 s : @xmath86 and @xmath87 s are the legendre polynomials in the variable @xmath88 , with the normalisation : @xmath89 in hindsight , this is of course what we should expect from a direct expansion of equation  ( [ theform ] ) , combined with harmonic analysis .",
    "it is worth noting that we can insert any of our favourite harmonic potentials from electromagnetism ( or higher dimensional generalisations ) and get a supergravity solution corresponding to a distribution of d  branes .",
    "this could in principle be wrapped on k3 , as we do in section  [ wrapping ] . however , since these are most commonly found as a series expansion of the form above , exact determination of the crucial enhanon and repulson loci ( as we do later ) will not in general be possible .",
    "it is interesting to probe the system with a point particle using the standard technology .",
    "there are killing vectors @xmath90 and @xmath91 which , for a particle moving on timelike geodesics , with velocity @xmath92 , define for us conserved quantities @xmath93 and @xmath94 . in terms of these , we can write a first integral of the geodesic equation . the purely radial motion on the equatorial plane or along the symmetry axis ( , assuming @xmath95 , and @xmath96 ) of the test particle is described by @xmath97 the effective potential that the particle probe feels is @xmath98 we plot @xmath99 for a particle approaching along the equator and also along the @xmath59axis in figure  [ veffa ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that accompanying this negative brane region is a repulsive behaviour in the supergravity .",
    "a test particle located along the @xmath59axis sees a potential which is repulsive inside a radius @xmath13 .",
    "this has nothing to do with the repulson singularity coming from wrapping , which we will study shortly , so we must bear in mind that it is a feature which will descend from the unwrapped configuration to the wrapped configuration . later , in section  [ others ] , we shall see that there is no such behaviour for d5brane distributions , and so we will treat this as an artifact of the d6brane case in what follows , as it will not affect our analysis of the excision of the repulson behaviour arising from wrapping .",
    "we have learned enough about our configuration to return to our problem of wrapping the branes on k3 .",
    "wrapping a d6brane on k3 induces precisely one unit of negative d2 brane charge in the d6brane world  volume . as in ref.@xcite",
    ", this suggests that the appropriate supergravity solution is that appropriate to a d6brane with delocalised d2branes in its world ",
    "volume@xcite , where in the d2brane harmonic function , we put @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the volume of k3 as measured at infinity and @xmath102 .",
    "this leads to the following geometry ( we remind the reader here that there are no real d2branes in the geometry ) : @xmath103 with @xmath104 @xmath105 is the metric of a unit volume k3 surface , and the functions @xmath106 and @xmath107 were defined before .",
    "the dilaton and r  r fields are given by @xmath108 despite being a solution to the supergravity equations of motion , the geometry for this configuration is not consistent .",
    "naked singularities ( seen  by examining the curvature invariants @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , . ) of repulson@xcite type appear where the running k3 volume , given by : @xmath112 shrinks to zero .",
    "some algebra shows that this occurs at radii : @xmath113.{\\label{singularityradius}}\\ ] ] when @xmath13 is zero , we have the spherically symmetric situation where the singularity appears on a sphere of radius @xmath114 . for non  zero , but sufficiently small @xmath13",
    "the singularity appears at two disconnected loci , one of them inside the other , and between these loci the metric ( [ d6d2metric - oldcoordinates ] ) is imaginary .",
    "when @xmath13 reaches the critical value @xmath115 these two surfaces meet and join into one single surface for @xmath116 .",
    "we expect stringy effects to have switched on long before a vanishing volume is reached , since when the volume gets to the value @xmath117 , there are extra massless states coming from wrapped d4 and anti  d4branes , giving an enhanced @xmath10 in spacetime .",
    "the radius at which this occurs is the enhanon radius , and it is easily computed to give : @xmath118\\ .{\\label{enhanconradius}}\\ ] ]    this is of course the same radius that gives a zero of the effective tension of a probe wrapped d6brane , whose action is@xcite : @xmath119 where @xmath120 @xmath121 are the coordinates on the unwrapped part of the world  volume and @xmath122 is the induced metric . working in static gauge the potential vanishes and we obtain the result for the effective lagrangian : @xmath123 and we can read off the effective mass ( tension ) as @xmath124 let us study the enhanon radius given in equation  ( [ enhanconradius ] ) . for @xmath38",
    "we recover the spherically symmetric case with enhanon radius @xmath125 . for non ",
    "zero @xmath13 , two different situations can be observed , depending on whether @xmath13 is smaller or greater than the critical value : @xmath126    when @xmath127 , there are two enhanon shells which divide our geometry into three distinct regions .",
    "the tension of a d6brane probe drops to zero at the outer enhanon shell .",
    "let us call the exterior region of positive tension region i. in between the outer and inner enhanon shells , the tension of our probe would be negative .",
    "we will call this region ii .",
    "this is the region where we encountered the repulson singularities  ( [ singularityradius ] ) and it will be excised shortly .",
    "finally , the tension is again positive in region iii , inside the inner enhanon shell",
    ". we can be sure that singularities are contained in the region ii only , because the running k3 volume is a continuous function and @xmath128 .",
    "the origin @xmath39 , appears to be problematic , since it solves both equation  ( [ singularityradius ] ) and equation  ( [ enhanconradius ] ) .",
    "in fact , if we approach @xmath39 along the @xmath59axis , we get @xmath129 while an approach along the equator shows that @xmath130 , which is puzzling .",
    "this is partly resolved by going to the extended coordinates , where @xmath39 opens up into a disc .",
    "then we see that @xmath131 as we approach the edge of the disc , while @xmath132 on the interior of the disc .",
    "notice what happens when @xmath133 .",
    "the inner and outer enhanon shells meet at two points on the @xmath59axis .",
    "the tension of a brane probe moving along this axis drops to zero at the enhanon radius and becomes positive again .    for @xmath134 ,",
    "the inner and outer enhanon shells have merged into a single connected shell with a toroidal shape .",
    "our geometry is now divided into two distinct regions .",
    "the volume of k3 is less than @xmath117 in the interior of the torus .",
    "the repulson singularities lie inside the torus .",
    "actually , although there is no physical significance to the fact , it is worth noting that the repulson loci undergo a similar evolution from disconnected to connected ( with the critical value @xmath135 separating the two cases ) , with shapes of the same sort . since @xmath136 ,",
    "the repulson always becomes connected before the enhanon locus does .",
    "this all seems rather complicated , but is quite beautiful to look at , in fact .",
    "we have already sketched the enhanon loci in figures  [ loci ] and  [ notsphere ] , but now we put it together with the repulson loci by shading in dark grey ( or blue for viewers in colour ) in the regions where the volume is greater than zero but less than @xmath117 in figure  [ k3volume - oldcoordinates ] , for different values of @xmath13 .",

    "ultimately , we must remove the parts of the geometry resulting from the wrapping which are unphysical . in order to do this , we must see what sorts of geometry we can replace the bad parts with , ascertaining whether it is consistent to do so .",
    "consistency here will be measured at the level of supergravity , bolstered by intuition from the physics of the underlying string theory .",
    "new stringy physics appears when the volume of the k3 gets to @xmath117 .",
    "a wrapped d6brane probe becomes massless there and also delocalises .",
    "one can not place wrapped d6brane sources in the regions where the volume is less than @xmath117 and so , as in previous cases , the geometry must be , to a good approximation , simply flat space .",
    "the junction between the flat space and the well  behaved geometry , ( across which the extrinsic curvature will jump , providing a stress tensor source ) must be equivalent to a massless brane .",
    "this is the logic that was tested in ref.@xcite for the spherically symmetric case with the single prototype shell , and also with additional d2branes , and further in ref.@xcite for the case of geometries made of mixtures of d5 and d1branes . in these works ,",
    "it was always spherically symmetric situation under study , but there was a family of concentric enhanon shells of different types , and sometimes non  trivial geometry was grafted in , for consistency .",
    "the novelties here are that we have no spherical symmetry , and the nested shells can intersect for some ranges of the parameters , making a toroidal shape .",
    "as we shall see , despite this complication , the gravity junction technology@xcite allows us to analytically demonstrate that there is a variety of consistent excisions that we can perform .",
    "one can perform the excision procedures that were carried out in refs.@xcite , even though we are far from spherical symmetry , if we are careful about how we set up the problem .",
    "let our spacetime @xmath167 have coordinates @xmath168 , and a metric @xmath169 . a general hypersurface @xmath170 within @xmath167 deserves its own coordinates @xmath171 , and so it is specified by an equation of the form @xmath172 .",
    "the unit vector normal to this hypersurface is then specified as @xmath173 the induced metric on @xmath170 is the familiar @xmath174 the main object we shall need is the extrinsic curvature of the surface .",

    "@xmath177 , giving : @xmath178 using the coordinates @xmath179 , we get the simple more commonly used expression : @xmath180 in the axially symmetric case , the equation specifying @xmath170 is @xmath181 , where @xmath109 is now a function of @xmath182 . since @xmath183 the unit normal vectors are @xmath184 we can compute the extrinsic curvature : @xmath185 where @xmath186 .",
    "this relation will be useful below when we calculate the stress  energy tensor along axially symmetric enhanon shells .",
    "we will discuss the toroidal enhanon first .",
    "as observed before , the volume of k3 drops below  @xmath117 in the interior of the torus . in this region ,",
    "the metric has the same form as given in equation  ( [ d6metric - oldcoordinates ] ) , but we replace @xmath187 and @xmath188 with new harmonic functions , @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "the precise form of these harmonic functions will be determined by the consistency of the theory . transforming to einstein frame @xmath191 , ( this is the natural frame in which to perform this sort of computation ) we use the axially symmetric extrinsic curvature  ( [ curvature ] ) to determine the stress ",
    "energy tensor along the surface joining our two solutions .",
    "there is a discontinuity in the extrinsic curvature across the junction defined by @xmath192 the stress ",
    "energy tensor supported at this junction is given by @xcite : @xmath193 for our particular geometry , the stress ",
    "energy tensor can be computed to be : @xmath194 where @xmath65 has been defined in equation  ( [ siggy ] ) and the prime denotes @xmath195 .",
    "also , newton s constant is set by @xmath196 , in the standard units@xcite . the indices @xmath197 and @xmath198 run over the k3 directions ( @xmath199 ) , while parallel to the brane s unwrapped world  volume directions we have indices @xmath200 which run over the ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "the transverse directions are labelled by indices @xmath202 . as expected , the stress ",
    "energy tensor along the transverse directions vanishes , which is consistent with the bps nature of the system s constituents .",
    "the tension of the discontinuity can be obtained from the components in the longitudinal directions .",
    "recall from equation  ( [ repulsive - potential - minimal ] ) that @xmath203 at the enhanon loci given in equation  ( [ enhanconradius ] ) .",
    "for vanishing tension , then , looking at our result in the middle line of equation  ( [ se ] ) , we require that @xmath204 vanishes at this radius as well .",
    "in addition to this constraint , positive tension between the two enhanon shells requires , @xmath205 .",
    "if we wish to saturate the bound and assume @xmath189 and @xmath190 have a similar form to @xmath187 and @xmath188 , the harmonic functions are in fact constant , and a suitable solution is : @xmath206 so we are able to successfully perform the task of cutting out the bad region contained within the toroidal enhanon , replacing it with flat space .",
    "it appears that we can have the resulting shell made of zero tension branes , as is in keeping with the intuition about the stringy fate of the constituent branes .",
    "we must note that the `` point '' @xmath39 is not entirely satisfactory .",
    "indeed , we are justified in thinking of the entire geometry as that of a torus , since in the extended coordinates , this point is really a disc of radius @xmath13 . on the edge of this disc , as stated before , the asymptotic volume is ambiguous , but the value @xmath101 seems to be the most physically consistent , as this is what it is in the disc s interior .",
    "there is no singularity on the disc s interior , and the volume is not at a special value .",
    "this means that there is no requirement to place physical branes there , and so the torus genuinely has a hole in the centre , and not just a single point .",
    "we have ignored the fact that the form of the harmonic function in that region indicates that we might have a negative density of branes on the interior of the disc .",
    "we are free to ignore this , since there is no singularity there : the supergravity analysis tells us that we are free to place the zero tension distribution of branes over the whole toroidal surface instead .",
    "of course , there is still the fact that there is repulsion along the symmetry axis as seen by a test particle moving in the geometry .",
    "again , we stress that this behaviour has nothing to do with the wrapping : it is an artifact of the continuous brane distribution we started with",
    ". this would not occur for other branes , as we show in section  [ others ] .",
    "we also have the case @xmath15 , when the enhanon lies in two disconnected parts .",
    "we have two choices .    *",
    "the first is to simply cut out the entire interior region , and replace it by flat space .",
    "this then gives a simple oblate enhanc con shape .",
    "this is perfectly fine as a solution , and has the extra feature that it gives a case where wrapping removes the entire disc located at @xmath39 .",
    "this means that this is a case where the enhanc con mechanism removes negative tension branes which show up in the unwrapped distribution . in the event that the peculiarities associated to the ring at @xmath39 turn out to be unpalatable , this is a satisfactory conservative choice .",
    "it is also the gentlest generalisation from the point of view of the dual moduli space of the gauge theory we shall discuss in section  [ gaugetheory ] .",
    "* we can also keep both the inner and the outer shell , and place flat space in between .",
    "this means that the ring is kept again , but then the same words that we used in the case of the toroidal cases apply the volume returns to the asymptotic value , @xmath101 again .",
    "the inner enhanon would then be another copy of the outer one .",
    "it would also fit with the observation that there is a finite repulsion : it is in fact an attraction in this picture .",
    "while intriguing , the fact that we can connect to the @xmath207 case may make this harder to justify . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath13 is a parameter and not a physical quantity , it may be that we are free to explore this alternative .",
    "let us check the supergravity analysis for this case .",
    "recall the three regions defined in section  [ wrapping ] .",
    "region ii represented the unphysical geometry where the tension of a brane probe becomes negative .",
    "it contains the repulson singularity .",
    "we can perform an incision as was done for the toroidal enhanon by defining @xmath189 and @xmath190 as above , between the two enhanon shells .",
    "the geometry of regions i and iii are consistent and can be defined as in equations  ( [ d6metric - oldcoordinates ] ) .",
    "we can alternatively define the harmonic functions in region iii to be @xmath208 where @xmath209 .",
    "the double enhanon , then , allows for some number @xmath210 of wrapped d6branes in the interior of our geometry .",
    "if we perform the excision , the stress  energy tensor for the outer shell is as in equation  ( [ se ] ) where @xmath109 is the outer enhanon radius .",
    "the inner shell has a stress energy tensor given by : @xmath211 here @xmath212 is the equation  ( [ enhanconradius ] ) of the inner enhanon shell defined in terms of @xmath213 .",
    "again , the transverse stresses vanish and the tension vanishes at the inner enhanon shell .",
    "so , we see that we have constructed a geometry which is consistent with supergravity and excises the unphysical negative tension brane geometry resulting from wrapping .    in the case of the double shell enhanon geometry",
    ", one might wonder how such a geometry can be constructed .",
    "consider probing our geometry with @xmath214 d2branes as was done in refs.@xcite .",
    "such branes are able to pass through the enhanon shells since they are not wrapped on the k3 and so their tension remains positive .",
    "this is evident from the effective lagrangian @xmath215 we can additionally probe our geometry with @xmath216 d2d6 bound states , as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian is given by : @xmath217 the presence of the bound d2brane ensures that the volume of k3 does not drop below @xmath117 .",
    "the bound state can therefore pass through the outer enhanon shell and continue on to the origin .",
    "once we are in the interior , region iii , we can separate the d2branes from the d6branes since the k3 volume is greater than @xmath117 there .",
    "the d6branes have positive tension and hence are free to move about in the interior . if we attempt to move a d6brane out of region iii , the volume of k3 approaches @xmath117 as the brane nears the inner enhanon shell .",
    "the d6brane becomes tensionless at the inner enhanon and melts into the shell , as happens for brane approaching the outer shell from outside .",
    "hence , d2d6 bound states can be used to move d6branes into the interior and to add d6 branes to the inner enhanon shell .",
    "it is easy to imagine building the double shell enhanon geometry in this fashion , starting with widely separated d2 and d6branes , and then removing the d2branes after the construction .",
    "we focused on d6branes almost exclusively , but it should be clear that many of the amusing features that we have seen are also present for wrapping d4 and d5 branes .",
    "in fact , we ought to stress again here that the possibly unpalatable feature of the negative brane density and its repulsive potential are not generic .",
    "( we have already seen that the disc brane distributions for all of the other branes have positive densities everywhere . )    the feature of having multiple solutions for the enhanon locus will occur also .",
    "in fact , it will give up to _ three _ solutions for the d4brane s enhanon loci , but only one for the d5brane .",
    "this is because the harmonic functions will be of the form : @xmath218 for @xmath219 and one non  zero parameter @xmath76 .",
    "the equation determining the enhanon loci is of the form of equating a ratio of two of these @xmath220 s to a constant , @xmath221 which gives a quadratic equation in the case of the d6brane , as we have seen , but only a linear equation for d5branes .",
    "the d4brane case will give a cubic equation .      actually , it is worth looking briefly a bit more at the d5brane case , keeping non ",
    "zero both of the parameters , @xmath222 , that we can have with four transverse directions .",
    "taking the extremal limit of the rotating black d5brane solution given in ref.@xcite we get for our unwrapped solution : @xmath223 where @xmath224 and @xmath225 the extended coordinates are given by : @xmath226 considering the case @xmath227 will give the ring density mentioned previously .",
    "let us consider particle probes of the geometry .",
    "previously we associated repulsive gravitational features of the d6brane distribution with a negative brane density on the disc .",
    "the d5brane distribution did not have negative brane density , and indeed , does not show these repulsive features . in this case the transverse space ",
    "time has one more dimension , but it is also endowed with one additional killing vector related to the @xmath228 coordinate . therefore an analysis similar to the one set forth in section  [ probing ] shows that test particle motion in @xmath229 and @xmath230 directions is governed by the same effective potential given in equation  ( [ veef ] ) .",
    "in fact , the effective potential in the @xmath231 direction does depend only on @xmath232 and in the @xmath233 direction only on @xmath234 , while the form of dependence is identical . as figure  [ oblated5_veff ] shows ,",

    "the probe computation yields the tree level and one  loop contribution to this result , and there are no perturbative corrections .    in the present case , we should be able to see new physics , since the parameter @xmath13 should have some meaning in the gauge theory .",
    "in fact , we expect that it should be controlling the vacuum expectation value of an operator made by the symmetric product of the adjoint scalars , by analogy with the case in the ads / cft@xcite context . here , the @xmath109symmetry is @xmath262 .",

    "the leading terms in this large @xmath286 expansion should have an interpretation as the contribution of the operators which are switched on .",
    "the @xmath289 result is that of the spherical case@xcite .",
    "the case @xmath290 comes with the legendre polynomial @xmath291 , which has the @xmath109charge of the  @xmath266 , the simplest operator one can make out the adjoint scalars .",
    "so the parameter @xmath13 , ( , @xmath197 ) controls the vacuum expectation value of this operator , with subleading contributions coming from the higher spherical harmonics .",
    "notice that this expansion is not sensitive to some of choices that we can make in doing the excision .",
    "in particular , while it works for any @xmath13 , it is for large @xmath56 .",
    "so from the point of view of this expansion , all of the choices are equivalent to the excisions which give a single locus : for @xmath292 , this is the oblate enhanon with flat space inside , while for @xmath293 , it is the toroidal shape .",
    "the difference between the two is presumably non  perturbative in the operator expansion",
    ". it would be interesting to find gauge theory meaning for cases where we can choose to have a double shell .",
    "we have seen that enhanon shapes quite different from the prototype spherical case can be well described within supergravity .",
    "we achieved this by wrapping distributions of d ",
    "branes on  k3 , and uncovered many interesting and beautiful features of the resulting geometry .    while the main example we used here ( the d6brane distribution ) had a physical oddity at its core ( a negative contribution to the brane density ) , we continued to use it as out main example , since it is clear that this feature does not affect the discussion of the enhanon .",
    "indeed , we showed that all of the salient features we wanted to illustrate are present for d5brane distributions , ( and very likely also extend to d4branes ) which do not have any such problems with the distribution s density .",
    "for the d5branes in fact , it is clear that the excision process always removes the original disc distribution of branes ( this time they are all on the edge ) , and so the problem in that case is moot .",
    "in fact , it would be interesting to study our d6brane distribution further to determine if there is some mechanism , perhaps similar to the enhanon , which might resolve the apparently unphysical features ( repulsive force and negative brane density ) that we observed .",
    "this odd behaviour may be a residual effect inherited from the fully rotating configuration since we are studying an extremal limit of that solution .",
    "perhaps a consideration of the full solution will provide additional insight .",
    "we were able to use the geometry to extract some quite interesting new information about the associated @xmath0 gauge theory whose moduli space is isomorphic to that of the wrapped d6brane problem .",
    "one can read off the details of which operator vacuum expectation values have been switched on from an expansion of a probe result in terms of spherical harmonics . of course , similar results for other gauge groups should be easily extracted by a generalisation of the work of ref.@xcite along the lines done here .",
    "overall , it is very satisfying that we can find and exactly analyse such intricate structures , successfully correcting poorly behaved supergravity geometries with knowledge from the underlying string theory .",
    "this is encouraging , since such studies have potential applications to searches for realistic gauge / geometry duals , better understanding of singularities in string theory , and a host of other inter  related problems .",
