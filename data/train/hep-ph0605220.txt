    "<S> with the perturbative qcd approach based on @xmath0 factorization , we study the pure annihilation type radiative decays @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the branching ratio of @xmath3 is @xmath4 , which is too small to be measured in the current @xmath5 factories of babar and belle . </S>",
    "<S> the branching ratio of @xmath2 is @xmath6 , which is just at the corner of being observable in the @xmath5 factories . a larger branching ratio @xmath7 is also predicted . </S>",
    "<S> these decay modes will help us testing the standard model and searching for new physics signals .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 meson rare decays are interesting for testing the standard model and searching for new physics . however , due to our poor knowledge of non - perturbative qcd , predictions for many interesting exclusive decays are polluted by large hadronic uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> the two body radiative @xmath5 decays involve simpler hadronic dynamics with only one hadron in the final states , so they suffer much less pollution than non - leptonic decays . </S>",
    "<S> the radiative decays such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 thus attract much attention @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the isospin breaking effects between the charged @xmath10 and neutral @xmath11 in these modes are mainly due to contributions from the annihilation type diagrams @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the importance of the annihilation type diagrams can also be shown from the pure annihilation radiative @xmath5 decays . </S>",
    "<S> the color suppressed @xmath12 and @xmath3 modes are of this kind . </S>",
    "<S> the former is tree dominant while the latter is a pure penguin flavor changing neutral current decay . despite the fact that they are </S>",
    "<S> annihilation type decays , these decay amplitudes can be factorized as the b meson to photon transition form factor @xmath13 times the decay constant @xmath14 or @xmath15 in the naive factorization approach .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the vertex corrections for the four quark operators have been performed in the so called qcd factorization approach @xcite , utilizing the light - cone wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> the branching ratios turn out to be one order of magnitude different from the naive factorization approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a large contribution from next - to - leading order corrections implies that the hadronic uncertainty in this kind of decays is as large as other hadronic annihilation type decays @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent study of soft collinear effective theory @xcite also shows that the naive factorization contribution is not the only dominant contribution , which contradicts to qcd factorization claims . </S>",
    "<S> more theoretic study is needed before one can claim new physics effects in these decays .    in this paper , we will use an alternative approach- the perturbative qcd approach ( pqcd ) @xcite to calculate the pure annihilation type decays @xmath3 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> based on @xmath16 factorization , the pqcd approach has been proposed and applied to calculate two body non - leptonic @xmath5 decays such as @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath19 @xcite , the radiative decays @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite , etc . and the results are consistent with experimental data . in this approach , </S>",
    "<S> the quark transverse momentum @xmath16 is kept in order to kill the end - point singularity . </S>",
    "<S> because of inclusion of transverse momenta , double logarithms from the overlap of two types of infrared divergences , soft and collinear , are generated in radiative corrections . </S>",
    "<S> the resummation of these double logarithms leads to a sudakov form factor , which suppresses the long - distance contribution .    for convenience , we work in the light - cone coordinate , where the @xmath5 meson momentum in its rest frame , is @xmath22 by choosing the coordinate frame where the vector meson moves in the `` @xmath23 '' direction and photon in the `` + '' direction , the momenta of final state particles are @xmath24 where @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum of the light quark in @xmath5 meson is : @xmath26 for the final state vector meson , we set the momentum of @xmath27 as @xmath28 in above functions , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are momentum fractions of the quarks .     </S>",
    "<S> process in pqcd . ]    in pqcd approach , the decay amplitude is factorized into the convolution of the mesons wave functions , the hard scattering kernel and the wilson coefficients , which stand for the soft , hard and harder dynamics respectively . with transverse momentum and sudakov form factor , </S>",
    "<S> the formalism can be written as : @xmath31},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the conjugate space coordinate of the transverse momentum @xmath33 , which represents the transverse interval of the meson . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 is chosen as the largest energy scale in the hard scattering kernel @xmath35 in order to suppress higher order corrections . </S>",
    "<S> the light cone wave functions of mesons are not calculable in principle in pqcd , but they are universal for all the decay channels . so that they can be constrained from the measured other decay channels , like decays @xmath36 @xcite , @xmath37 @xcite , etc .    </S>",
    "<S> since the outgoing photon can be only transversely polarized , the decay amplitude can be decomposed into two parts as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the momenta of vector meson , and photon , respectively . @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the relevant polarization vectors . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix element @xmath43 can be calculated in the pqcd approach .    in principal , the leading order contributions for @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) </S>",
    "<S> decays involve only four - quark operators plus a photon emitted from any of the quark line . </S>",
    "<S> the effective weak hamiltonian is formed by the @xmath46 four - quark operators and the corresponding qcd corrected wilson coefficients @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> very recently the electromagnetic penguin operator @xmath47 contribution through @xmath48 with one photon connecting to the @xmath49 meson is studied in ref.@xcite . the branching ratio for @xmath50 </S>",
    "<S> is found to be @xmath51 which is larger than the four quark operator contribution from qcd factorization approach @xcite . in pqcd language , the contribution from @xmath47 is next - to - leading order . </S>",
    "<S> its contribution is still smaller than other contributions in pqcd approach which will be shown later . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of this kind of operator to the @xmath2 decay is negligibly small .    </S>",
    "<S> the lowest order feynman diagrams of @xmath52 in pqcd are shown in fig.[fig1 ] . in principle , the photon can be emitted from any quark line of the four - quark operator . however , the contribution of fig.[fig1](c ) is canceled exactly by that of ( d ) because of topology symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> thus , only the decay amplitudes from fig.[fig1](a ) and ( b ) are left as : @xmath53,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] @xmath54,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 is the modified bessel function which results from fourier transformation of the quark propagator . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 is sudakov form factor , @xmath59 is vector meson decay constant and @xmath60 denotes ckm matrix elements . in above calculations , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 meson is treated as a heavy - light system , whose wave function is defined as : @xmath61 and the expression of distribution amplitude @xmath62 is shown in ref.@xcite with parameter @xmath63gev , which is normalized as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the decay constant of the @xmath5 meson . since we do not need the @xmath49 or @xmath66 wave functions in the calculations of feynman diagrams fig.[fig1](a ) and ( b ) , we need not show them here .    for @xmath67 decay , only penguin operators can contribute , and the ckm matrix elements are @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of the wilson coefficients in eq.([ampl ] , [ amp2 ] ) are : @xmath69 the wilson coefficient of dominant qcd penguin operator @xmath70 cancels much with @xmath71 , and @xmath72 cancels with @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a result of color suppression in this decay , since at least three gluons are needed for a vector @xmath49 meson produced from penguin diagram @xcite . for @xmath74 , both tree and penguin operators give contribution , and corresponding conclusions of the wilson coefficients are : @xmath75 again , @xmath76 cancels much with @xmath77 which is also a result of color suppressed tree contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath60 in tree ( penguin ) operators is @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) .    with the amplitudes @xmath80 and @xmath81 defined in eq.([msp ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , the decay width of @xmath44 is given by @xmath82    in our numerical calculations , the input parameters are summarized in table  [ parameter ] , where @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are ckm parameters in wolfenstein parametrization @xcite , and @xmath87 , @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> their values can be found in review of particle properties @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> .summary of input parameters@xcite [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     at the leading order , the main uncertainty for decay branching ratios comes from the @xmath5 meson wave function . </S>",
    "<S> but it is constrained by the measured exclusive hadronic decays , like @xmath89 @xcite , @xmath90 </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with parameter @xmath91 from @xmath92 to @xmath93 . on the other hand , there should be large uncertainty since we work only at leading order in @xmath94 for the hard part and also for the wilson coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the missing next - to - leading order correction is a very important uncertainty for rare decays . to estimate it </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the hard scale @xmath34 at a range of @xmath95 with the above major uncertainties from @xmath5 meson wave function parameter @xmath91 and the different scale @xmath34 , respectively , we give out the branching ratio of @xmath67 : @xmath96 there are many other uncertainties in our calculation such as decay constants and ckm matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> however , the uncertainty induced by above factors is not more than @xmath97@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> with such a small branching ratio ( [ br ] ) , this decay is too rare to be measured at the running @xmath5 factories or even in future lhc - b experiment . </S>",
    "<S> our result is still much smaller than the recent upper limit @xmath98 from experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if some new physics particles enhance this ratio through tree or loop effects @xcite , it may be measurable in near future experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> after similar calculations , we also give the branching ratio of @xmath99 decay : @xmath100 because this process is tree diagram dominated , it is much larger than that of @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is still not big enough to be measured at the @xmath5 factories but it is already around the corner of @xmath5 factories capability . </S>",
    "<S> currently , there is only upper limit , which is @xmath101 at @xmath102 confidence level @xcite .    from our calculation , we find that most of the contribution comes from fig.1(b ) , which indicates that photon emission from the light quark of the @xmath5 meson is easier than that from the heavy quark . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the heavy quark is much difficult to become off - shell than the light quark , while a nearly on - shell quark rarely emits photons .    within qcd factorization approach </S>",
    "<S> , the branching ratios of these two decays have been calculated in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results are given as : @xmath103 compared with their results , we find that our results are one order of magnitude larger . in qcd factorization approach , some next - to - leading order contribution has been added in addition to the naive factorization contribution . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that these presumably order @xmath94 corrections change the branching ratios by one order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> in fact these two decays are non - factorizable contribution dominant in naive factorization approach . </S>",
    "<S> usually qcd factorization approach calculation for this kind of decays ( such as @xmath104 @xcite ) is not stable . </S>",
    "<S> they receive dominant contribution from non - factorizable diagrams , sometimes with an endpoint singularity in the collinear factorization . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , our numerical results are also much larger than the naive factorization approach , which is mainly due to a smaller energy scale ( @xmath105 other than @xmath106 ) used in the calculation of the wilson coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> this uncertainty comes from part of the next - to - leading order effect in pqcd approach .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath107 decay is the same as @xmath108 decay within su(3 ) symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> it is also a pure annihilation type decay . </S>",
    "<S> the decay formulas are exactly the same except replacing the corresponding ckm factor @xmath109 , @xmath110 by @xmath111 , @xmath112 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the su(3 ) breaking effect , we used @xmath113 @xcite , @xmath114mev , we can get @xmath115 which should be easy to be measured in the future lhcb experiment .    in a summary </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the branching ratios of pure annihilation type radiative decays @xmath67 and @xmath116 within the standard model in pqcd approach . </S>",
    "<S> we find the branching ratio of @xmath67 is at the order of @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> this small branching can not be detected in the running b factories of babar and kek , unless some new physics enhance this results sharply . in future </S>",
    "<S> , this decay may be measured in lhc - b experiment or other high luminosity experiments . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath108 decay , the branching ratio is about @xmath118 , which is just close to the @xmath5 factory experiment capability of measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental measurements of these decays would be very useful for understanding various qcd methods , like qcd factorization and pqcd approaches . </S>"
