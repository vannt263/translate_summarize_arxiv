    "the last eight billion years have witnessed strong evolution of the disk galaxy population .",
    "both ` archaeological ' studies of local disk - dominated galaxies and ` look - back ' studies of the evolution of disk galaxies suggest a steady build - up in their stellar masses since @xmath9 .",
    "insights into how this growth occurs are accessible through the study of disk galaxy scaling relations , such as the luminosity  rotation velocity ( tully - fisher ) relation or the luminosity  size relation . yet , owing to sample size limitations , selection effects , and differences in analysis techniques , these studies have come to widely divergent conclusions . in this paper , we explore the evolution of the luminosity  size and stellar mass  size relations over the last 8 gyr ( since @xmath9 ) using a sample of almost 5700 disk - dominated galaxies from the hst gems survey ( galaxy evolution from morphology and seds * ? ? ?",
    ".    in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) picture of structure formation , collapsing dark matter perturbations acquire angular momentum through tidal torques and mergers @xcite .",
    "some fraction of this angular momentum is conserved , leading to the formation of cold , rotationally - supported disks .",
    "the typical magnitude of the specific angular momentum predicted in this framework leads to the formation of present day disks with approximately the correct distribution of radial sizes , if the specific angular momentum of the gas is similar to that of the dark matter and is mostly conserved during the formation process @xcite .",
    "a difficulty is that this idealized picture does not correspond to the outcome when the process of galaxy formation is simulated in detail within the cosmological context of cdm . in hydrodynamical simulations",
    ", the gas tends to lose a large fraction of its initial angular momentum , resulting in disks that are too small compared to observed nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , very few ` late - type ' disks are formed in such simulations : galaxies tend to suffer mergers that thicken and destroy their disks @xcite .",
    "it is not yet established whether this problem represents a fundamental difficulty with the ` standard ' cdm paradigm ( i.e. , a result of excess small scale power ) , a reflection of our incomplete ability to understand and simulate the complexities of star formation and supernova feedback , or inadequacies in numerical resolution .",
    "many proposed solutions to this problem involve _ delaying _ gas collapse and disk formation to later times , either by adopting an alternate power spectrum with reduced small scale power ( such as warm dark matter ) , in which structure formation occurs later ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or by invoking some form of feedback that prevents the gas from cooling until relatively late times @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "while these solutions would be consistent with an important build - up in the disk galaxy population at late times , the late formation times implied by these models may be in conflict with the old ages of disk stars in the milky way and m31 .",
    "additional constraints can be gleaned from so - called ` backwards evolution ' models , in which the ages and metallicities of the stars in present - day disk galaxies are used to constrain the formation history of different components within our and other galaxies @xcite .",
    "direct measurements of the mass  size scaling relations and radial size distributions of disk galaxies at earlier epochs will provide an important counterpoint to these arguments by providing direct constraints on the angular momentum content of stars at these earlier times .    a number of previous studies have used the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) to quantify the evolution of disk galaxies by measuring their absolute sizes and magnitudes as a function of redshift . magnitude and size",
    "are strongly correlated ; a line of constant surface brightness falls _",
    "almost _ parallel to the distribution of observed galaxies , making the evolution of galaxy surface brightness a natural choice for parameterizing the evolution of galaxy sizes . however , the results of studies measuring average rest - frame surface brightnesses as a function of redshift have proven controversial , ranging from detecting no evolution to rather strong evolution in the range of 1 - 2 mag arcsec@xmath5 brightening by redshift @xmath7 .",
    "for example , @xcite found an average increase of the surface brightness of @xmath10 mag by redshift @xmath7 .",
    "this result is supported by observations of galaxies at high redshifts ( @xmath11 ) , detected in very deep ground - based near - infrared images @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate that the average rest - frame surface brightness of these objects is more than 2 - 3 mag arcsec@xmath5 brighter than in the local universe .",
    "@xcite pointed out that selection effects play a crucial role in such analyses .",
    "after accounting for the different sources of incompleteness , @xcite and @xcite argue that the luminosity  size relation of disk galaxies evolves by less than 0.4 mag arcsec@xmath5 over the interval @xmath12 .",
    "yet , in order to reproduce the observations , both groups found it necessary to introduce a new population of high surface brightness galaxies in the highest redshift bin ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "a different interpretation was suggested by @xcite , who find strong evolution of the average rest - frame @xmath6-band surface brightness of @xmath13 mag arcsec@xmath5 at a redshift @xmath14 , also including a full treatment of completeness .    in this work",
    ", we present the results from a new sample of disk - dominated galaxies from the gems  survey .",
    "each of our galaxies has a spectrophotometrically - measured redshift , a spectral energy distribution , and a stellar mass estimate @xcite from combo-17  .",
    "we combine these sed constraints with light - profile shapes and sizes determined from deep high - resolution _ hst _  _ advanced camera for surveys _ ( _ acs _ ) images .",
    "we reassess the evolution of the magnitude  size and stellar mass  size relation as a function of redshift over the range @xmath15 , taking particular care to model the impact of the selection function .",
    "we suggest a resolution to the conflicting previous results by presenting a coherent picture of strong surface brightness evolution with redshift without the need for a new population of high surface brightness galaxies .",

    "rest - frame absolute magnitudes and colors , accurate to @xmath40.1mag , are also available for these galaxies .",
    "furthermore , using a simple parameterized star formation history and the photometry in the 17 combo-17  bands , @xcite computed stellar mass estimates for each galaxy in our sample , assuming a @xcite stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "these mass estimates are consistent with those derived using a one - color - based transformation from light to mass as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "while such estimates suffer from uncertainties in the imf , ages , dust , and metallicity , it is encouraging to note that several studies @xcite find good agreement between masses based on broad - band colors and those from spectroscopic ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and dynamical @xcite techniques .",

    "we wish to isolate the subset of galaxies whose light is dominated by a disk component .",
    "we start by identifying all galaxies that can be reasonably well - fit by any single srsic  profile @xcite using the two - dimensional fitting code galfit@xcite .",

    "the best - fit model is given by 7 parameter values and their associated uncertainties , including the half - light radius , the srsic  index and the total magnitude .",
    "initial galfit  starting guesses for the model parameters were obtained from the sextractor  source catalogues . typically , neighbouring galaxies were excluded from each model fit using a mask , but in the case of closely neighbouring galaxies with overlapping isophotes the galaxies were fitted simultaneously . the sky level for each galaxy",
    "was carefully measured using flux growth curves , masking out detected neighbouring sources .",
    "lacking an estimate for the srsic  index from sextractor , we started all fits with @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , all galaxies with @xmath39 were fitted with gim2d@xcite . estimates for magnitudes , sizes and srsic   indices from the two codes agree very well ( see bell et al .",

    ", young stars make a progressively smaller contribution with increasing wavelength .",
    "therefore , galaxy morphologies in f850lp are smoother than those in f606w , leading to a more robust detection and deblending of extended sources .",
    "the f850lp band corresponds to rest - frame @xmath41 , @xmath6 , and @xmath42-bands at @xmath43 , 0.7 , and 1 respectively .",
    "selection of a galaxy sample for this kind of study is a multi - step process .",
    "first we merge the gems  catalogue with the combo-17  redshift catalogue , then we select disk - dominated objects , and finally we remove sources with poor fits ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_sample ] ) .",
    "we start by matching the gems  sources to the combo-17  catalogue . to account for the relatively high source density in the gems  images",

    "we isolate disk - dominated galaxies for further study by cutting the sample based on the srsic  profile fits .",

    "the final catalogue contains 5664 disk galaxies with absolute rest - frame @xmath42- and @xmath6-band magnitudes , redshifts and stellar masses obtained from combo-17and apparent half - light radii and srsic  indices from galfit .      in order to compare our measurements to a local reference point",
    "we have opted to use the nyu value - added galaxy catalog ( vagc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is based on the second data release ( dr2 ) of the sdss  @xcite .",

    ", we use the vagc elliptical aperture srsic  fits for estimates of @xmath59-band half - light radius , srsic  index and -flux ; coupled with extrapolated circular aperture @xmath60 fluxes .",
    "the magnitudes were converted to absolute galactic foreground extinction - corrected magnitudes using the latest k - correct routines , which were also used for the original data @xcite .",
    "we apply the following correction to convert the sdss  elliptical half - light @xmath59-band sizes to rest - frame @xmath6-band ( see @xmath16  [ restsizes ] ) : @xmath61 .",
    "the redshift of the individual sdss  sources does not impact significantly on this correction factor . to obtain a rest - frame @xmath42-band size for the sdss  galaxies we use : @xmath62 .",
    "we have chosen the vagc rather than the fits to the magnitude  size and stellar mass  size planes by @xcite for various reasons .",
    "using the vagc we have full control over all estimated parameters including the photometric system , k - corrections , etc .",
    "specificially , the fits by @xcite where performed on circularized size estimates while we use elliptical srsic  measurements .",
    "the half - light sizes and absolute magnitudes by @xcite were provided only in sdss  filters , necessitating the use of color transformations and of additional luminosity function convolutions in order to obtain mean values for the same selection and photometric system as the gems   data .",
    "furthermore , the vagc allows us to repeat the same analysis procedure that was also used for the gems  data .",
    "finally , the vagc incorporates the latest version of the sdss  pipeline , leading to more robust srsic  indices , fainter apparent limiting magnitudes and fewer problems with deblending large sources . since the vagc and",
    "the data used by @xcite have @xmath63 sources in common we could verify that the measured parameters broadly agree with each other .",
    "the vagc does not contain stellar masses .",
    "therefore , we have used the prescription given in @xcite to convert a @xmath64 color into a sdss  @xmath59-band stellar mass - to - light ratio : @xmath65 we have applied a correction of @xmath660.15 to convert to a kroupa imf , in accord with our gems  stellar masses .",
    "the stellar mass was then obtained from the following relation : @xmath67 with the absolute rest - frame srsic  magnitude @xmath68 , the apparent rest - frame srsic   magnitude @xmath69 , the luminosity distance @xmath70 and the absolute magnitude of the sun @xmath71 in sdss  @xmath59 .",
    "calculating a stellar mass in the same fashion for the lowest redshift gems   galaxies and comparing this estimate with the sed - based masses @xcite reveals no apparent systematic offsets .",
    "galaxies are known to exhibit radial color gradients . as a result of this , galaxy sizes vary as a function of wavelength and the measured physical size evolution of the galaxy population could be skewed by the effects of band shifting with redshift .",
    "therefore , we have not simply converted our apparent half - light sizes @xmath72 measured in the f850lp filter to a physical value , but instead have applied a color gradient correction to each individual galaxy according to its redshift to correct the size to the rest - frame @xmath6-band . for a sample of local galaxies , presents the relative disk scale lengths , which for a pure disk corresponds to @xmath73 , in the @xmath42- , @xmath6- , @xmath41- , @xmath74- , @xmath75- and @xmath76-bands .",
    "figure  [ fig_sizecorr ] illustrates this ratio of the disk scale lengths in one band to the size measured in the @xmath6-band , as a function of the corresponding wavelength .",
    "a linear fit with the intercept fixed to 1 at the @xmath6-band results in a slope of @xmath77 , corresponding to correction factors varying by only @xmath78 over the whole redshift range .",
    "all future references to effective radii @xmath31 are to sizes corrected to the rest - frame @xmath6-band .    in order to obtain rest - frame sizes for the sdss  data we have calculated the ratio of the circularized half - light sizes in the five sdss  bands , divided by the size in the sdss  @xmath79-band .",
    "we overplot the resulting values in fig .",
    "[ fig_sizecorr ] , minimizing in a simultaneous fit the offset between the sdss  points and the other @xmath6-band normalized measurements .",
    "the agreement between the various measurements is striking .",
    "this supports the validity of the _ average _ correction to obtain rest - frame sizes , bearing in mind the 20% galaxy - by - galaxy scatter , and that this method , strictly speaking , applies only to nearby galaxies .",
    "given the possible rapid evolution of galaxy disks in the last 8 billion years , it is not inconcievable that the ` average ' disk color gradient has evolved considerably since @xmath9 . in a subsequent paper",
    "we will reconstruct the rest - frame @xmath42-band for individual galaxies and estimate sizes directly from this image to account for this effect . as an interim solution",
    ", we have tested the applicability of the local average relation on distant galaxies in gems .",
    "we have fit all gems  galaxies in the f606w band using exactly the same approach used to fit in f850lp . owing to significant differences in the depth of the f606w and f850lp data , and f606w s extra sensitivity to ongoing star formation , we consider the f606w fits at this stage to be preliminary- or @xmath6-band sizes on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis . ] . from these fits",
    "we selected those sources for which one of the bands corresponds to the rest - frame @xmath6-band and measure the size ratio at @xmath80 ( f606w @xmath4 @xmath81 ) and at @xmath82 ( f850lp @xmath4 @xmath81 ) .",

    "we combine the gems  detection probability and the combo-17  completeness by multiplying the two values for each individual object : @xmath90 we can now estimate the combined detection probability @xmath91 of individual galaxies . since later on we weight galaxies by the inverse of the detection probability we have taken special care when using very low detection probability values . in order to avoid attributing large weights to any given galaxy ( which would then dominate the whole sample ) , we remove any object with @xmath92 from the sample ( a total of 14 sources ) . for the main analysis presented here ,",

    "this slope closely matches that of a line of constant volume density , i.e.  a law such that the ratio of flux and the cube of the radius is constant ( @xmath111 ) , rather than a line of constant surface density ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the fact that the slope does not match that of a constant surface brightness implies that measuring average surface brightnesses depends to some extent on the range in magnitudes over which the average is calculated .",
    "thus , in order to quantify the evolution of the surface brightness one has to make sure that the same range of absolute magnitudes is observed at all redshifts .",
    "the sample becomes approximately magnitude - limited at @xmath113 .",

    "we conclude that the combined gems  + combo-17  sample is essentially magnitude - limited only , with surface brightness playing a minor role .",

    ", this limit is fainter than our adopted absolute magnitude cut .    inspection of fig .  [ fig_abscomp ] shows that the sample reaches @xmath120 in the highest redshift bin ; therefore in what follows we restrict our analysis to this absolute magnitude range at all redshifts .",

    "the reason for this is two - fold . on one hand",
    "the absolute magnitude limit @xmath237 and the lower stellar mass limit @xmath238 are chosen rather conservatively , leading to a removal of almost all sources with @xmath243 .",
    "on the other hand , once the absolute magnitude limit reaches the region where the detection probability drops , galaxies fall along a line of constant apparent magnitude ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_completeness_data ] , at @xmath244 the 50% completeness contour is almost vertical ) .",
    "thus , calculation of a mean surface brightness ( or surface mass density ) is evenly ( un-)affected by the completeness correction ( independent of surface brightness ) .",
    "both these arguments arise from the fact that the gems  data is not limited in surface brightness .",

    "this has to be interpreted as the surface brightness at which one starts removing galaxies from the sample with the lowest surface brightness , thus shifting the average to higher surface brightnesses .",
    "measuring constant mean values at the lowest surface brightnesses , however , does not necessarily imply that the average does not shift .",
    "it rather means that we run into our completeness limit eventually , i.e.  we do not detect the galaxy population at all that might yet exist at such a faint level .",
    "the question is , whether we reach a plateau in @xmath132 or @xmath133 before we run into the gems  surface brightness limit . to test this",

    "we find that both @xmath132 and @xmath133 vary systematically as a function of @xmath233 and @xmath236 .",
    "the reason for this is that the distribution of galaxies in the magnitude  size plane does not exactly fall along a line of constant surface brightness , but has a slightly steeper slope .",
    "this is most obvious at the lower redshift bins where we have the largest dynamic range in absolute manitudes .",
    "therefore , our results are strictly true only for the adopted limiting magnitude @xmath237 .",
    "if one were to repeat our evaluation with deeper data , thus reaching fainter absolute limiting magnitudes at the highest redshift , one should expect to find slightly different absolute values for @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",

    "the same line of reasoning of course also holds for @xmath238 .    the only way to circumvent this problem",
    "would be to move from measuring evolution in the surface brightness to a new variable @xmath259 , which matches the observed slope of the low redshift population .",

    "we can rule out differences in the datasets as the source of our divergent conclusions .",
    "owing to the similarity of the datasets , we can reproduce the analysis of @xcite in some detail .",
    "@xcite assessed the average @xmath42-band central surface brightness of their sample as a function of redshift , limited in surface brightness to @xmath158 . for both the goods  and the gems  data sets the @xcite surface brightness limit implies removing half to two thirds of all galaxies at @xmath159 that are detected above the absolute magnitude limit and have a measured redshift .",
    "note that only @xmath160 of all galaxies were excluded at the highest redshift ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "obviously , by using only one third of galaxies with the highest surface brightness , one introduces a strong bias in the measurement of @xmath162 and the derived value will therefore not represent the average properties of disk galaxies at that redshift .",
    "adoption of the surface brightness limit used by @xcite yields very consistent results to theirs for @xmath162 ( right - hand panel of fig .",
    "13 ) . for the gems  data",
    "we find evolution at less than the 0.4 mag arcsec@xmath5 level using their selection criteria .",
    "as expected the high redshift data points are the least affected by their surface brightness limit . however , at lower redshift the results achieved using their selection criteria start to deviate systematically from the analysis we presented earlier . specifically , the lowest redshift point with the surface brightness cut is more than 10@xmath163 off the expected value ( as estimated from our linear relation ) without such a cut .",
    "@xcite adopted a very similar strategy , and also found very weak evolution , although in their case low number statistics are also an important source of uncertainty ( there are only 5 and 6 galaxies in their lowest two redshift bins , respectively ) .",
    "the analysis of @xcite and @xcite , justifiably , imposed the selection function of high - redshift galaxies on the low - redshift galaxy population , and asked whether the average surface brightness of galaxies which one could have in principle seen at @xmath9 has evolved . clearly , because of cosmological surface brightness dimming the bulk of nearby galaxies would be invisible if placed at @xmath164 , and are omitted from consideration .",
    "one then finds little difference in the population of local galaxies that would be observable at @xmath8 .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt a different approach .",
    "in essence , we step gradually outwards from low redshift to higher redshift , asking at each stage if there is any evidence that the results are significantly biased due to cosmological surface brightness dimming .",
    "the @xmath165 sdss data are clearly not surface brightness limited for galaxies with @xmath120 . stepping outwards to @xmath166 in the gems data , the surface brightness limits are well clear of the observed drop - off in galaxy number density for galaxies with @xmath120 .",
    "similarly for @xmath43 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 ; at each redshift we have clearly detected both sides of the size distribution in a region where completeness is @xmath169% , and the observed drop - off is real .",
    "thus , the observed evolution , at least out to @xmath168 , is a genuine property of the entire disk galaxy population and is unaffected by surface brightness dimming .    at @xmath9 ,",
    "it is less obvious that the data are well clear of the selection boundaries  we correct for incompleteness using the estimates obtained by applying our pipelines to artificial galaxies . yet , even at the @xmath9 bin we reach well beyond the peak of the surface brightness distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_sbhist ] ) , within the limits that we can confidently correct for incompleteness .",
    "therefore , either the evolution we measure in that bin is roughly correct , or the galaxy surface brightness distribution would have to be bimodal . in that case",
    "we could not observe a hypothetical second peak of low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "furthermore , these galaxies would have to fade significantly ( and faster than the `` normal '' galaxy population ) with time , because otherwise we would detect these objects at lower redshifts .",
    "so far there are neither observational nor theoretical grounds on which to expect such a population of low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "it is worth noting that if the galaxy population did not evolve towards higher surface brightness at higher redshift , we would have seen that in the data , as the sample out to @xmath168 is clearly deep enough to probe the entire @xmath120 galaxy distribution in the high completeness region .",
    "[ [ a - new - population - of - high - surface - brightness - galaxies - at - high - redshift ] ] a new population of high surface brightness galaxies at high redshift ? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    @xcite and @xcite suggest that at @xmath7 a distinct population of very high surface brightness galaxies emerges that is not detected at lower redshifts .",
    "@xcite describe these objects as sources with very high surface brightness @xmath170 ( they found 9 candidates ; 18% of all galaxies detected at that redshift ) .",
    "@xcite delineate this group of objects as compact ( @xmath171 kpc ) and bright ( @xmath172 ) . using their classification , @xmath173 of the galaxies at @xmath7 fall into this category .",
    "one might conjecture that the introduction of a new population of high surface brightness galaxies at @xmath9 simply arises in order to interpret the increasing average surface brightness within a global picture of a non - evolving @xmath162 .",
    "our results suggest that the _ whole distribution _ of surface brightnesses shifts with redshift , naturally leading to a larger number of high surface brightness galaxies at higher redshift .",
    "furthermore , we find no evidence that the surface brightness distribution changes its shape ( at the 10% level , from inspection of fig .  8) .",
    "interestingly , both @xcite and @xcite introduce the appearance of this new group of objects just at the high redshift limits of their surveys . at those redshifts",
    "@xmath174 their values for the average surface brightness are generally in agreement with the gems  data points .",
    "we have shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_sbevo_b]b that we can reproduce the effect of a flattening in the evolution of @xmath162 by introducing a hard upper surface brightness cut . however , the bulk of the remaining evolution appeared in the highest redshift bin ( and hence one could propose the introduction of a new class of high surface brightness galaxies to account for this ) . after removing the highest surface brightness galaxies as classified by @xcite or @xcite , even the gems  data do not show a significant redshift - dependent trend in @xmath162 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig_sbevo_b]b ) .",
    "although this line of reasoning appears to be consistent it nevertheless has a major drawback . at the lowest redshift the results should agree with the average surface brightness obtained from the sdss",
    "this fact alone should raise strong concerns regarding the global sampling of the local galaxy population . only strong evolution of @xmath175",
    "can account for both convergence with the local data point and the high redshift results from @xcite , @xcite and the results presented in this paper .",
    "to summarize , we believe that the weak surface brightness evolution found by @xcite and @xcite , and the emergence of a ` new population ' of high surface brightness galaxies at @xmath9 results from differences between their analysis technique  which imposes the high - redshift selection function on galaxies at all redshifts  and our analysis technique , which implicitly steps out gradually from the local towards the high redshift universe , asking if there is any evidence for the galaxy distribution running into the surface brightness detection limits . applying the same selection criteria as @xcite , we also found weak surface brightness evolution .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is that it can not yield quantitative statements about the evolution of the global ensemble of disk galaxies , especially at low redshift .",
    "the basic picture of disk formation within a hierarchical universe posits that the dark matter and gas are ` spun up ' by tidal torques in the early universe .",
    "the internal angular momentum is generally characterized by the dimensionless spin parameter , @xmath176 . assuming that the gas does not suffer significant loss of specific angular momentum during collapse",
    ", the size of the resulting disk @xmath177 is expected to scale as @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the radius enclosing the gas before collapse ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in cosmological n - body simulations",
    ", it is found that the distribution of values of @xmath176 for dark matter halos follows a characteristic log - normal form , and that the value of @xmath176 does not correlate with halo mass , nor does the distribution of @xmath176 evolve with time @xcite .",
    "thus , to first order , we expect the size of a disk of fixed mass to scale with time in proportion to the virial radius of the dark matter halo : @xmath180^{-2/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath181 is the scale length at @xmath182 and @xmath183 is the hubble parameter as a function of redshift @xcite . using the definition of the surface mass density eq .",
    "[ eq_rhorest ] we find : @xmath184 with the surface mass density at redshift zero @xmath185 . since we are interested in the relative evolution only , we normalize the curve to the observed value @xmath186 and show the redshift dependence in fig .",
    "[ fig_massevo ] .",
    "the expectation of this very naive model is that disks at @xmath8 should be a factor of two denser at fixed mass than they are at the present day , in clear contradiction with the observational results .    in reality , however , we expect there to be several other competing factors .",
    "for example , the internal density profile of the dark matter halo , as commonly characterized by the concentration @xmath187 , will also impact the final size of the disk , in the sense that halos with higher concentration will produce smaller , denser disks .",
    "the average concentration at fixed halo mass is a function of epoch , scaling as @xmath188 @xcite .",
    "thus , the fact that halos were _ less _ concentrated at @xmath7 by about a factor of two will tend to counteract the strong evolution in surface density indicated above .",
    "as well , there are numerous other complications : there is certainly not a straightforward relationship between halo mass and the mass of baryons that collapse to form a disk ; the specific angular momentum of the baryons that comprise the disk may not be equal to that of the dark matter halo ; the disk size can be affected by the presence of a pre - existing bulge ; and halos with low spin parameters and/or large disk masses may not be able to support a stable disk @xcite .",
    "in addition , a proper comparison of the predicted evolution of the disk mass - size relation with the data requires a careful treatment of the observational selection effects .",
    "we defer this analysis to a future work ( somerville et al . in prep ) .",
    "based on two - dimensional fits to the light profiles of all gems  sources we have compiled a complete and unbiased sample of disk galaxies .",
    "our disk sample was defined by its radial profile , specificially by srsic  profiles with concentrations lower than @xmath44 .",
    "combo-17  provided us with redshifts , rest - frame absolute magnitudes and stellar masses for @xmath189 sources . in order to compare the gems  data to a local reference",
    "we have obtained the vagc , containing the same information as provided by gems  for @xmath190 nearby ( @xmath191 ) sdss  galaxies . inspecting the magnitude  size and the stellar mass  size relation for disk galaxies as a function of redshift",
    "we have come to the following conclusions :    @xmath192 at high redshifts @xmath7 the gems  survey is complete only for galaxies with absolute magnitudes @xmath2 or stellar masses @xmath193 . in order to properly address the potentially severe biases that arise when one attempts to explore the evolution of the galaxy population over this redshift range , we have computed a detailed 2-dimensional selection function and introduced a lower limiting absolute magnitude cut .",
    "@xmath192 treating completeness and selection effects carefully , we find that the average surface brightness of disk galaxies increases with redshift , by about 1 magnitude from @xmath8 to the present in the rest - frame @xmath6-band .",
    "@xmath192 the values calculated in our study are consistent at the high redshift end with the results of @xcite and @xcite and at the low redshift end with the value estimated from the sdss  vagc .",
    "we have shown that the reasons the studies of @xcite and @xcite reached rather different conclusions from our own ( weak or no surface brightness evolution over the same redshift range ) are primarily related to the way the data were analyzed , as well as to problems with small number statistics in the lower redshift bins .",
    "in particular , applying a hard lower surface brightness cut leads to removing substantial numbers of galaxies in the low redshift bins , and to a strong bias in the estimated value of the _ average _ surface brightness . this approach yields average surface brightness estimates at low redshift @xmath1940.4 that do not converge with the `` zero redshift '' results from sdss .",
    "we confirmed that when we apply the same selection criteria to the gems  data , we obtain results that are consistent with those of @xcite .",
    "@xmath192 in contrast to the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite , we find that there is no need to appeal to a new population of high surface brightness galaxies , which makes its appearance at high redshift .",
    "the increased number of high surface brightness galaxies at high redshift is a natural result of the surface brightness evolution that we have detected .",
    "@xmath192 while the magnitude  size relation shows strong evolution with redshift , we show that the stellar mass  size relation stays constant with time . @xmath192 the most naive theoretical expectation is that disks of fixed mass should be about a factor of two denser at @xmath8 , in clear contradiction with our results .",
    "several competing factors probably conspire to produce the weaker evolution that we observe .    @xmath192 as the stellar mass of galaxies increases with time , the fact that the surface mass density does not evolve as a function of redshift implies that _ on average _ disk galaxies form inside - out , i.e.  through increasing their disk scale lengths with time as they grow in mass .    based on observations taken with the nasa / esa _ hubble space telescope _",
