    "discovery of the suppression of high transverse momentum ( ) hadrons in relativistic heavy ion collisions  @xcite and the absence of such suppression in collisions  @xcite inspired intense theoretical work during the past decade .",
    "the phenomenon was immediately interpreted , in fact , even predicted  @xcite , as the energy loss of a hard scattered parton in the hot , dense strongly - interacting quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formed in the collision .",
    "prompted by the large amount of very diverse experimental data from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  namely , by suppression patterns at various collision energies , colliding systems , and centralities  several models have been developed , based mostly on perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) ( see section  [ subsec : models ] as well as  @xcite ) .",
    "the suppression patterns are quantified by the nuclear modification factor , defined for single - inclusive s as    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the production cross section of in collisions , @xmath16 is the nuclear overlap function averaged over the relevant range of impact parameters , and @xmath17 is the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions computed with @xmath18 . despite their different approaches , several models  @xcite were able to describe the and centrality dependence of within experimental uncertainties . at the same time , those models provided very different estimates of medium properties such as the transport coefficient @xmath19 , the average 4-momentum - transfer - squared per mean free path of the outgoing parton within the medium . for this reason , alone does not provide sufficient constraint for extracting medium properties such as @xmath19 from the theoretical predictions , because it averages the varying energy losses along many different paths of the parton in the medium .    while dihadron correlation measurements are a successful approach to constrain @xmath20 of the parton in the medium  @xcite , the single particle observable typically has smaller statistical errors and higher reach .",
    "in addition , if is measured as a function of the azimuthal angle with respect to the event plane of the collision , the average path length @xmath20 can be constrained  @xcite . in all but the most central ion - ion collisions ,",
    "the overlap region of the nuclei is not azimuthally isotropic .",
    "the average distance the parton traverses before emerging and fragmenting varies as a function of the angle with respect to the event plane .",
    "each collision centrality class selects different @xmath20 values , so the differential observable directly probes the path length dependence of the energy loss .",
    "the first measurements of azimuthal asymmetries of nuclear suppression and collective flow  @xcite used s as the probe , which has the advantage that s are relatively easy to identify over a very wide range in a single detector  a crucial factor in mitigating systematic uncertainties .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , both collective flow and azimuthal dependence of nuclear suppression can be formally defined at any , but they have historically and conceptually different roots .",
    "the notion of collective flow originates in lower phenomena , and is usually interpreted as a _ boost _ to the original spectrum ( of partons or final state particles ) in the direction of the highest pressure gradient .",
    "in contrast , and are typically used to describe high behavior , and their decrease from unity interpreted as a _ loss _ of parton momentum due to the presence of a medium . in this paper , results on production , the nuclear modification factor , and its azimuthal dependence in terms of the event - plane - dependent are presented . the results presented here",
    "are based upon the data collected in the 2007 rhic run .",
    "the data sample is four times larger than that of  @xcite .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : etapi0fit ]    the lack of nuclear effects on this ratio indicate that at high p@xmath27 the fragmentation occurs outside the medium and the ratio is governed by vacuum fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "this is also supported by a recent global analysis of @xmath28 fragmentation functions ( consider figure 5 in  @xcite and the fact that the relevant @xmath29 range , the fraction of the four - momentum of the parton taken by a fragment , in the current measurement is about 0.050.2 ) .",
    "the relevant p@xmath27 is presumably 56 , below which recombination may be a significant hadronization mechanism ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) . also , it should be pointed out , that precise knowledge of the absolute value of this ratio is important for the background calculations in dielectron and direct photon measurements .              the reference yield of @xmath31 in collisions has been obtained from data taken in 2005  @xcite",

    "it should be noted that in these three models the energy loss is proportional to @xmath73 , where @xmath13 is the path length in the medium , and the quadratic dependence is characteristic when radiative energy loss is the dominant mechanism .",

    "such a hybrid procedure was first suggested in  @xcite .",
    "the virtual gluons radiated into the medium are governed by pqcd , but the interactions of those virtual gluons with the medium to bring them on shell is done by assuming that the transverse - momentum - squared is proportional to @xmath73 as given by an ads / cft calculation  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the weak - coupling expression for the transverse - momentum - squared , @xmath74 .",
    "this results in an energy loss proportional to l@xmath75 instead of l@xmath76 as in the case of the pqcd - based models .",

    "both the current measurement and  @xcite explore a region of high p@xmath27 where the mechanism leading to an azimuthally anisotropic yield is parton energy loss rather than hydrodynamical flow .",
    "it is increasingly difficult for purely pqcd - based models to explain these results and one is led to the tentative conclusion that strong coupling plays an important role in parton energy loss in the medium . at present ,",
    "the best method to do the relevant calculations is in an ads / cft framework .",

    "is given , which indicates that the energy loss at lhc ( alice data ) is about 30% higher than at rhic , and that the loss falls slightly with energy .",
    "the dependence of these observables on momentum and center - of - mass energy ( presumably on energy density ) will be a crucial factor in untangling the underlying mechanisms of parton energy loss .",
    "recently , experiments at the lhc have begun to examine the behavior of fully reconstructed jets , which should give more easily interpretable information on this phenomenon .",
