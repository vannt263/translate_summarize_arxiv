    "recent advances in sparse inverse problems , often referred to as compressive sensing  @xcite , have led to new methods and technologies for compressive image reconstruction .",
    "the central idea is to design encoded , subsampled linear measurements which allow for accurate optimization - based decoding which assumes sparsity in some transform domain such as wavelets or curvelets  @xcite .",
    "applications of interest include fluorescence microscopy  @xcite , infrared microscopy  @xcite and astronomy , for example the single - pixel telescopic system  @xcite .",
    "intensity measurements , in which a pixel array is sampled using a binary ` on - off ' mask , are often considered an attractive choice .",
    "for example , in the case of the single - pixel camera  @xcite , a spatial light modulator ( slm ) in the form of a digital micromirror device is typically used for image acquisition , and binary measurements are simplest to encode into hardware . meanwhile",
    ", it is important for the computational efficiency of the optimization - based reconstruction that the measurement matrix can be implemented as a fast transform .",
    "the walsh - hadamard transform ( wht )  @xcite , which involves a measurement matrix consisting of @xmath0 entries , is therefore an attractive solution , and so measurement schemes are often based upon it ( see for example each of the references given above ) .",
    "one of the central tenets of compressive sensing is that uniform , random , subsampling is optimal for reconstructing signals whose sparsity pattern is unstructured  @xcite .",
    "however , wavelet transforms have an inherent multi - scale structure , and the sparsity patterns associated with the wavelet transforms of natural images are in consequence highly structured , with signal energy being concentrated in the coarse ( low frequency ) scales .",
    "in fact , the wht itself has a multi - scale interpretation , and it has now been established that improvements in reconstruction accuracy result from subsampling the wht at a variable rate ; and in particular , more aggressively at finer ( higher frequency ) scales  @xcite .",
    "practical schemes incorporating the above principles typically involve randomly subsampling the wht coefficients , while varying the subsampling rate with scale  @xcite .",
    "implementation of this approach requires the locations of the selected random coefficients to be stored and the full wht to be repeatedly computed within the reconstruction algorithm .    in this paper",
    ", we consider an entirely deterministic approach to variable , multi - scale , @xmath0 sampling .",
    "the scheme leads to comparable reconstruction performance , but without the need to rely upon randomness . as a result",
    ", no locations of randomly selected coefficients need to be stored , and full whts can be replaced with more efficient transforms which directly compute the subsampled coefficients . the sampling scheme is based upon a family of matrices that have been shown both theoretically and empirically to be effective measurement matrices for compressive sampling : delsarte - goethals frames  @xcite .",
    "we will consider one particular instantiation of delsarte - goethals frames : _ real kerdock matrices_. the contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows .    * we show that applying a kerdock matrix to a signal results in multi - scale measurements , where the measurements at a given scale sample only a single scale of the _ haar wavelet transform _ of the signal . in other words , the kerdock transform is scale - preserving .",
    "* based on these new insights , we propose a new deterministic strategy for variable , multi - scale , @xmath0 sampling .",
    "we present experimental evidence that the new strategy leads to improved image reconstruction performance compared to the uniformly subsampled wht .",
    "the structure of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section  [ kerdock ] ,",
    "we give details on the real kerdock transform , and in section  [ scale ] , we establish the scale - preserving properties of the transform and make the connection to the haar wavelet transform .",
    "we then propose our new deterministic multi - scale sampling strategy in section  [ strategy ] .",
    "numerical image reconstruction experiments can be found in section  [ experiments ] , comparing the deterministic approach with other subsampling strategies .",
    "in this section , we give the essential form of the kerdock transform and refer the interested reader to   for further technical details . we define a @xmath1 kerdock matrix @xmath2 as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a @xmath5 normalized hadamard matrix and @xmath6 , for @xmath7 , is a diagonal matrix with @xmath0 entries on the diagonal .",
    "these diagonal entries are determined by binary quadratic codes known as kerdock codes ( see   for further details ) .",
    "the kerdock matrix @xmath2 is a union of orthobases , and it is instructive to consider how it operates on a vector divided into @xmath8 subvectors of length @xmath9 . writing @xmath10 we have @xmath11 in other words , it is a weighted sum of the whts of the subvectors @xmath12 .",
    "it follows immediately that there exists an @xmath13 transform for computing a matrix - vector product with @xmath2 : divide the input vector into subvectors , apply the wht to each , then apply the necessary componentwise sign changes to the resulting outputs and sum them .",
    "we will call this transform the 1d kerdock transform , and denote it by @xmath14 .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 controls the compression factor of the transform , which is @xmath8 . the ability to vary the parameter @xmath15 for different wavelet scales will be essential for designing a variable , multi - scale sampling strategy .",
    "we note that there is an upper bound on @xmath15 imposed by the underlying kerdock codes : we must have @xmath16 ( see  ) .    the extension to a 2d kerdock transform is achieved using the usual cartesian product . given a @xmath17 image @xmath18 ,",
    "define the 2d kerdock transform @xmath19 to be @xmath20",
    "the aim of this section is to show that applying a kerdock matrix to a signal results in multi - scale measurements , where the measurements at a given scale sample only a single scale of the haar wavelet transform of the signal . in other words ,",
    "the kerdock transform is scale - preserving .",
    "we restrict our focus in this section to the 1d kerdock transform , though the analysis extends naturally to the 2d kerdock transform and images .",
    "our starting point is a striking result about the relationship between the walsh - hadamard transfrom ( wht ) and the haar wavelet transform .",
    "given @xmath21 , let @xmath4 be the @xmath5 hadamard matrix with columns in dyadic / paley order  @xcite , and let @xmath22 be the matrix whose rows are the haar wavelet basis elements ordered in the usual way from coarse to fine scales , so that multiplication by @xmath22 gives the discrete haar wavelet transform .",
    "the matrix product @xmath23 has the following block - diagonal decomposition .",
    "* theorem 1 .",
    "* @xmath24    the result appears implicitly in the literature , for example in  , but appears explicitly here for the first time , to the authors best knowledge . a proof is given in appendix  [ proof ] .",
    "the result can also be viewed as a statement about the mutual coherence of the hadamard and haar bases .",
    "since the magnitude of the coefficients decays with scale , it is an example of the asymptotic incoherence described in  .",
    "now consider the kerdock transform of a signal @xmath25 ( see section  [ kerdock ] ) , and write @xmath26 for the decomposition of @xmath27 into @xmath8 subsignals , so that @xmath28 let @xmath29 be the haar wavelet transform of @xmath27 , and write @xmath30 for its haar wavelet decomposition by scales .",
    "write @xmath31 for the haar wavelet transform of each subsignal @xmath32 , @xmath7 , and @xmath33 for their respective haar wavelet decompositions by scales .",
    "also write @xmath34 for each diagonal matrix @xmath6 , @xmath7 , where the submatrices correspond in size to the wavelet scales",
    ". then we have @xmath35    but haar wavelets have a nested property : if we divide a signal @xmath27 into @xmath8 subsignals @xmath32 , the haar wavelet coefficients of @xmath27 at scale @xmath36 are nothing other than the haar wavelet coefficients of each of the subsignals at scale @xmath37 , that is , @xmath38 it follows that , writing @xmath39 for the decomposition of the output measurements by scale , we have , for @xmath40 , @xmath41 the output measurements at a given scale @xmath37 are thus seen to be nothing other than a weighted sum of the haar wavelet coefficients at scale @xmath36 , we replaced these subcodes with actual kerdock codes for each scale , which is a departure from  . ] .",
    "we can summarize the implications of the previous section as follows .    1 .",
    "the kerdock transform @xmath14 performs uniform sampling of the finest @xmath42 haar wavelet scales and gathers no information from the first @xmath15 wavelet scales .",
    "it can therefore be combined with direct sampling of the coarsest @xmath15 wavelet scales to give a two - level sampling scheme .",
    "note the desirable property that the coarsest @xmath15 scales , for which full samples are computed , are not further sampled unnecessarily by the kerdock transform .",
    "the subsampling factor @xmath8 can be chosen for each scale independently by computing measurements at each scale using whichever @xmath14 transform is desirable .",
    "an important remaining question is how to efficiently implement this multi - scale sampling scheme , and we leave this question as future work .    based on these observations , we propose a deterministic multi - scale sampling scheme for 1d signals .",
    "* inputs : * signal @xmath43 ; sampling strategy @xmath44 .    @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47    * outputs : * measurements @xmath48 .",
    "note that the required user tuning is straightforward and intuitive : simply provide a vector @xmath49 of integers , the entries of which give the power of @xmath50 by which the signal will be subsampled at each scale .",
    "let us write @xmath51 for this 1d multi - scale kerdock transform , and @xmath52 for the corresponding measurement matrix .",
    "the extension to 2d images immediately follows as in section  [ kerdock ] . given a @xmath5 image @xmath18 ,",
    "define the 2d multi - scale kerdock transform @xmath53 to be @xmath54",
    "we present a comparison of image reconstruction using different schemes for @xmath0 sampling .",
    "we sample the 1024x1024 ` man ' test image by taking @xmath55 samples ( a subsampling factor of @xmath56 ) . writing @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) for the vectorized 2d haar wavelet coefficients of the image , we can represent the linear measurements in the form @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is an @xmath61 matrix .",
    "we then use the ` spgl1 ` code  @xcite to solve the optimization problem @xmath62 we measure accuracy of reconstruction using the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , defined as @xmath63    we present results for three sampling schemes in figure  [ image_plots ] .",
    "schemes 1 and 2 are subsamplings of the 2d wht , taking @xmath55 randomly chosen coefficients ( scheme 1 ) and the first ( lowest frequency ) @xmath55 coefficients ( scheme 2 ) respectively .",
    "we see that the performance of random subsampling ( scheme 1 ) is , as the research consensus would now expect , disastrous , while the low frequency sampling ( scheme 2 ) represents a baseline with which to compare .",
    "+   +    scheme 3 is a version of the kerdock sampling scheme described in this paper , in which we directly sample the first @xmath64 scales of the wht , and then use kerdock matrices to subsample scales @xmath65 to @xmath66 , using @xmath67 for scale @xmath65 , @xmath68 for scale @xmath69 , and @xmath70 for scale @xmath66 ( see section  [ kerdock ] ) , again giving @xmath55 .",
    "we observe that the reconstruction accuracy using scheme 3 represents a significant improvement over scheme 2 , demonstrating the effectiveness of a deterministic multi - scale sampling strategy with a number of different subsampling factors across scales ( in this case four ) .",
    "given @xmath21 , the @xmath5 hadamard matrix with columns in dyadic / paley order  @xcite , @xmath4 , is defined by the recursion @xmath71\\;\\mbox{for}\\;m\\geq 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 denotes the usual kronecker product .",

    "the proof of theorem 1 is by induction on @xmath42 .",
    "noting that ( [ coherence ] ) holds trivially for @xmath75 , assume ( [ coherence ] ) holds for @xmath76 . using ( [ walsh_dyadic ] ) and ( [ haar ] ) , and by symmetry of @xmath77 , we have @xmath78\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\\psi_r^t\\otimes\\left(\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\1\\end{array}\\right)&i_r\\otimes\\left(\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\-1\\end{array}\\right)\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\\phi_r\\psi_r^t&0\\\\0&\\phi_r\\end{array}\\right],\\ ] ] and ( [ coherence ] ) now follows for @xmath79 , and hence for all @xmath21 by induction.@xmath80      adcock , b. , hansen , a. and roman , b. _ the quest for optimal sampling : computationally efficient , structure - exploiting measurements for compressed sensing_. in _ compressed sensing and its applications _ ; editors : boche , h. , calderbank , r. , kutyniok , g. and vybral , j. springer , pp . 143167 , 2015 .      calderbank , r. , howard , s. and jafarpour , s. _ construction of a large class of deterministic sensing matrices that satisfy a statistical isometry property_. ieee journal of selected topics in signal processing 4(2 ) , pp .",
