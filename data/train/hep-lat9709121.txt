    "for our tests we select as a low - cost laboratory the massive 2-flavour schwinger model ( 2d qed ) @xcite .",
    "the lattice model is given by the wilson plaquette and fermionic action .",
    "for details we refer to last year s proceedings @xcite .",
    "we work with the hermitean fermion matrix @xmath0 scaled so that its eigenvalues are in @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "to set the scale , we simulate using a hmc code working also with the hermitean matrix @xmath2 .",
    "the implementation includes optimization features like trajectory length set by @xmath3 and acceptance @xmath4 , and re - use of the cg solution in the trajectory via @xmath5 ( gain @xmath6 20% ) .",
    "alternatively to hmc , m. lscher proposed a local bosonic formulation @xcite .",
    "the one main variant we consider uses the fact that we are dealing with a hermitean fermion matrix thus allowing to exactly rewrite the effective distribution @xmath7 \\;\\ ; { \\rm det}[p_n(q^2)^{-1 } ] \\;\\ ; e^{-s_g(u ) }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath8 a polynomial of even degree @xmath9 approximating @xmath10 for _ real _ @xmath11 $ ] such that the correction factor @xmath12    \\approx 1 $ ] . its roots",

    "one update of the bosonic system consists of a trajectory of heat bath and over - relaxation steps for @xmath22 @xcite and @xmath23 fields , possibly followed by a metropolis appectance correction for @xmath24 $ ] . in total , this introduces the parameters @xmath9 , @xmath25 and the number of reflections per heat bath into the algorithm .",
    "the correction factor can be treated exactly with a metropolis accept / reject step or re - weighting @xcite using a stochastic method as demonstrated for the non - hermitean variant @xcite .",
    "the reweighting method computes a noisy estimate for @xmath24 $ ] and includes it in the observables .",
    "the metropolis correction step uses an acceptance probability @xmath26 dependent on a gaussian noise @xmath27 which satisfies detailed balance when averaged over the noise .",

    "this is non - trivial to solve .",
    "the task becomes trivial , if we recall the factorized form @xmath31 taking one factor from each c.c .",
    "we remark that the metropolis scheme includes a further optimization possibility which we call metropolis with adapted precision .",
    "we retain a valid algorithm if the inversion necessary for the metropolis decision is first executed with very small precision ( in our case @xmath32 ) and repeated with standard inverter precision ( @xmath33 ) only if the decision would else be unclear . as the cg",
    "can be restarted from the intermediate solution , this procedure could result in less work on the average .",
    "evaluating a high order polynomial for a matrix faces the problem of loss of precision . in the non - hermitean variant or re - weighting case",
    "we are able to avoid this by using the chebyshev recursion formula for @xmath34 . unfortunately the hermitean variant with metropolis correction or the polynomial hybrid monte - carlo algorithm @xcite",
    "rely on the evaluation of partial products of root factors .    in a forthcoming publication @xcite",
    ", we compare various proposals for reordering the roots to minimize numerical instabilities . in this work",
    ", we use a fairly stable version , the so - called bitreversal scheme , whenever no recursion is possible .",
    "recently , one of us proposed a different solution @xcite .",
    "we rewrite the metropolis acceptance to @xmath35 with @xmath36 given by @xmath37^{1 \\over 2 } \\eta$ ] . at this point",
    "we suggest solving for the inverse of the square root of @xmath38 directly .",
    "this can be accomplished with an expansion in gegenbauer polynomials converging exponentially with the same rate as cg .",
    "we simulate on 8x20 lattices with a conservative @xmath40 and a run length of usually @xmath41 , calculating the plaquette and correlations of local meson operators @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath46 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we expect finite size effects to appear in deviations from the approximately linear behaviour of the pion mass with @xmath39 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ mass ] , finite size effects are small for @xmath47 , resulting in a pion mass @xmath48 = 0.629 and a physical ratio @xmath49 .    [ mass ]",
    "to summarize , we repeat the schemes included in our investigation . besides hybrid mc to set the scale , we compare lba with re - weighting , lba with metropolis , lba with metropolis using adapted precision , and lba with gegenbauer inverter as described above .",
    "we point out that re - weighting and metropolis algorithms result in 2 different ensembles .",
    "therefore it is no longer possible to compare cpu cost by @xmath50 but one has to use a measure based on the relative error @xmath51 in these formulae @xmath52 signifies the number of measurements , @xmath53 the total number of matrix multiplications for the whole run .    to illustrate our search for optimal parameters , we depict in fig .",
    "[ cont ] the cpu cost in the @xmath54 plane ( number of reflections optimized ) for one algorithm , namely plain metropolis .",
    "the figure clearly shows that we obtain a flat optimum .",
    "we further compare only the optimal parameter sets and their cpu cost in table [ cost ] .",
    ".cpu cost minina - plaquette [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we think that this study gives further clear evidence that the lba is competitive to hmc .",
    "the tuning of the lba is fairly easy .",
    "the cpu cost can be lower than for hmc , but not by a large factor with present techniques .",
    "we want to stress that the gain factors for the plaquette and pion propagator differ with estimates from plaquette - like observables too optimistic .",
    "technically , the number of reflections per heat - bath update is found to be an important optimization tool .",
    "we also demonstrate that using a noisy metropolis scheme to make the lba exact is possible for the hermitean case as well .",
    "the gegenbauer inverter , which avoids instabilities in the evaluation of the polynomial , is shown to be competitive to cg in a first real simulation .",
    "we thank u. wolff , c. lang , k. jansen and r. frezzotti for discussions ."
