    "a basic but important question in physical chemistry concerns a chemical reaction that involves two steps : a to b to c. do the steps occur sequentially or simultaneously , i.e. , in a concerted / synchronous manner ? two examples of particular interest are coupled electron - proton transfer @xcite and double proton transfer .",

    "examining the plots shown in figure [ figf ] , suggests that the cusp catastrophe describes transitions between classes i and ii and between ii and iii .",
    "the transition between iii and iv is described by two simultaneous fold catastrophes .",
    "if the extrema are isolated the relative number of minima ( @xmath60 ) , maxima ( @xmath61 ) , and saddle points ( @xmath62 ) on the potential energy surface is constrained by the relation @xmath63 for example , in class iv , @xmath64 .",

    "@xcite states that if a smooth function @xmath69 as @xmath70 or if the gradient of @xmath71 points outward over a closed surface ( curve in two dimensions ) , then the isolated extrema of @xmath71 inside that closed surface , must satisfy the relation ( [ poincare ] ) .",
    "this condition is satisfied on general grounds because extreme compression or stretching of a bond makes the energy very large compared to the equilibrium energy .",
    "there have only been a few previous discussions about how global constraints such as equation ( [ poincare ] ) follow from differential topology .",
    "mezey considered lower and upper bounds for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , based on the morse inequalities @xcite .",
    "pick considered the corresponding equation [ which has zero on the right hand side ] for absorbates on periodic substrates @xcite .    a study of a simple model two - dimensional potential for double proton transfer @xcite also produced a phase diagram as a function of the model parameters and considered bifurcation of the instanton tunneling paths",
    "however , it has been argued that the model potential used there does not respect some of the symmetries of the problem @xcite .",
    "the ground state energy of the double h - bond system can be compared to that of two decoupled h - bonds where @xmath15 is the binding energy of an isolated x - h bond .",
    "the energy of a single h - bond for the corresponding two - diabatic state model @xcite is @xmath72 and the ground state energy of the two decoupled h - bonds is @xmath73 it turns out that for @xmath2 the ground state energy of the hamiltonian ( [ eqn - ham ] ) is given by an identical expression .",
    "thus , we see that it is differences between the single and double proton affinities that couple the two h - bonds together .",
    "the question of whether the two bonds are co - operative or not is subtle . is the binding energy enhanced or decreased ? is the barrier for double proton transfer increased or decreased ?",
    "figure 4 shows that as @xmath40 decreases ( and thus the coupling between the two h - bonds increases ) that the @xmath0 value needed to remove the barrier decreases . this is a signature of anti - co - operative behaviour .",
    "similarly the barrier for concerted proton transfer increases as @xmath40 decreases .",
    "the above analysis shows that a key parameter in the model is @xmath40 , the ratio of the second proton affinity , @xmath16 to the first proton affinity , @xmath15 .",
    "unfortunately , there are few calculations or measurements of @xmath16 for specific molecules , that i am aware of .",

    "this is equivalent to @xmath76 . for the chromophore of the green fluorescent protein ,",
    "the ground state energies of four different protonation states have been calculated at the level of ms - caspt2 with a sa2-cas(4,3 ) reference at the mp2 ground state geometry with a cc - pvdz basis set @xcite . with respect to the anion state the energies of the phenol , imidazolol , and oxonol",
    "cation states are -15.09 , -13.74 , and -24.72 ev , respectively .",
    "this leads to @xmath77 .",
    "given the values discussed above , the parameter range @xmath78 shown in figure 4 is chemically realistic",
    ".    for porphycenes chemical substitutions external to the cavity produce a range of @xmath0 values for the n - h@xmath38n bonds inside the cavity between 2.5 and 2.9 @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "this variation leads to the tautomerisation [ double proton transfer ] rate increasing smoothly by more than three orders of magnitude as @xmath0 decreases @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that in the model presented here the scale of the energy barriers is largely determined by @xmath80 which decreases with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "the plots shown in this paper use a parameterisation for o - h@xmath38o bonds @xcite .",
