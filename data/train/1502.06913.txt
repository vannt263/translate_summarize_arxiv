    "in the brane world scenario [ 1,2 ] our universe is assumed to be a submanifold , or brane , embedded in a higher dimensional bulk space time .",
    "in contrast with the traditional kaluza - klein [ 3 ] treatment of extra - dimensions , ordinary matter fields are confined on the brane , only gravity can propagate into the bulk .",
    "in particular , the scenario proposed by randall and sundrum [ 4 ] , consists of a single positive tension brane which is embedded in the five dimensional anti- de sitter ( i.e. @xmath0 , @xmath1 is curvature radius of bulk ) space ( @xmath2 ) with @xmath3 - symmetry ( the rs2 scenario [ 4 ] ) .",
    "however one may neglect the cosmological constant in @xmath4 brane ( i.e. @xmath5 ) by choosing rs fine tuning condition .",
    "it is well known that the cosmological field equations on the brane are essentially different from the standard 4 - dimensional cosmology [ 5 ] . in rs2 scenario ,",
    "the modified friedmann equations give @xmath6 at early stages of the evolution of the universe when the energy density is high ( i.e. @xmath7 ) and the standard four dimensional gravity is recovered on the brane in the low energy limit [ 4,6,7 ] ( i.e. @xmath8 when @xmath9 ) .",
    "recent observations [ 8 - 14 ] suggest that our universe is currently undergoing an accelerating expansion .",
    "this challenging issue in standard cosmology shows a new imbalance in the governing friedmann equations .",
    "physicists have addressed such imbalances by either introducing new sources or by altering the governing equations . in the frame of standard cosmology , this imbalance is addressed by introducing a new matter source termed as dark energy ( de ) in the friedmann equations .",
    "however the nature of de is completely unknown ( except for its negative pressure ) and is still an unresolved problem in modern cosmology [ 15,16 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "a group of physicists have explored the second possibility and modified the gravity theory itself , assuming that at large scales , einstein s theory of general relativity breaks down and a more general action describes the gravitational fields .",
    "these theories include f(r)- gravity , scalar tensor gravity , einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity , brane world gravity and many others [ 2,4,15 - 21 ] .",
    "in particular , brane world scenario is related to gravity in higher dimension and matter fields are confined to the brane . in the frame work of rs2 model , several models have shown the recent observed phenomena , specifically a self - interacting scalar field [ 22 - 26 ] behaves as dark energy .",
    "the dynamics of scalar field with constant or exponential [ 27 ] as well as self - interaction potential [ 28 ] has been studied in the context of frw cosmology .",
    "also scalar field coupled to barotropic fluid has been found in [ 29 - 35 ] .",
    "further , it should be mentioned that scalar field appears naturally in particle physics and in the present context it behaves as a source of de .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the dynamics of rs2 brane scenario in the context of interacting dark species .",
    "the dark energy ( de ) is chosen as a real scalar field with self interacting potentials while a perfect fluid model with barotropic equation of state is taken as a model for dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "the argument behind choice of interaction models is that they are favoured by observed data obtained from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) [ 36 ] and matter distribution at large scales [ 37 ] .",
    "further , das et al [ 38 ] and amendola et al [ 39 ] showed that an interaction model of the universe mimics the observationally measured phantom equation of state as compared to non - interacting models , which may predict a non phantom type of equation of state .    as the evolution equations in the brane scenario are very complicated in form so exact analytical solution is not possible for the present model .",
    "hence a dynamical system analysis in the phase space associated to this scenario is presented . to study the nature of the critical points , eigenvalues of the first order perturbation matrix near the critical points",
    "are examined . also classical stability analysis for the model",
    "is done . in this context ,",
    "relevant dynamical system studies in the brane scenario can be found in [ 40 - 43 ] and others .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii comprises of the essential details of randall - sundrum model and deals with basic equations in brane scenario and formation of dynamical system . in sections",
    "iii a detailed phase space analysis related to the critical points is presented , we discuss the existence and stability / instability of critical points as well as of the model in section iv . finally , the discussion and concluding remarks are given in section v. throughout the paper we use natural units ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "in the framework of rs2 brane model two dark species interacting non - gravitationally are considered in the background of flat frw model .",
    "one of the dark species namely the dark matter is considered in the form of perfect fluid with barotropic equation of state while the other dark component namely the dark energy ( de ) is chosen as real scalar field with arbitrary self interaction potential .",
    "so the modified einstein field equations are [ 44 - 47 ] @xmath11    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is brane tension , @xmath14 is barotropic index of the dark matter , @xmath15 is the total energy density of the dark species . here",
    "@xmath16 is the dark radiation term which arises due to non- zero bulk weyl tensor and c is constant parameter related to the black hole mass in the bulk .",
    "if the bulk is chosen as ads- schwarzschild then @xmath17 [ 45 ] while c vanishes [ 47,48 ] for ads bulk .",
    "for simplicity of calculation in the present work we shall choose the later bulk model so that @xmath18 .    it should be noted that we have neglected the cosmological constant in the 4d brane ( i.e. @xmath5 ) by choosing randall - sundrum fine tuning condition .",
    "the energy conservation equations for individual dark sectors are given by @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 stands for the interaction between the two dark species ( i.e. dark matter and dark energy ) .",
    "for the time being @xmath21 is unspecified only it is assumed that @xmath21 does not change sign during the cosmic evolution . in the above continuity equation ( 3 )",
    "@xmath22 is the energy density for dark matter and is related to the thermodynamic pressure by the relation @xmath23 , where @xmath14 is the barotropic state parameter bounded by the relation @xmath24 .",
    "however , @xmath14 should be very close to unity , and even greater , nor less than 1 , in order to satisfy the usual energy conditions imposed for dark matter .",
    "on the other hand , the energy density and pressure of the scalar field @xmath25 are given by @xmath26 with @xmath27 as the self interacting potential . now using ( 5 ) in the continuity equation ( 4 ) the evolution of the scalar field",
    "is given by @xmath28 at the early stages of the evolution of the universe the energy density is high ( i.e. @xmath7 ) so from the modified friedmann equation ( 1 ) @xmath29 .",
    "on the other hand , at late times , due to expansion the energy density of the matter falls off so that @xmath9 and we have @xmath30 i.e. the equation ( 1 ) behaves as the usual friedmann equation at late stages of the evolution .",
    "thus , although the brane effects are dominant at early epochs but the modified friedmann equation ( 1 ) describes the evolution of the universe at all times .",
    "moreover due to complicated form of the evolution equations namely equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) , it is not possible to have an analytic solution .",
    "hence for a qualitative idea about the cosmological behavior we shall put the evolution equations into an autonomous dynamical system . for this , we introduce the new variables @xmath31 which are normalized over hubble scale . as a result",
    ", the evolution equations reduce to the following autonomous system of ordinary differential equations ( after some algebra ) @xmath32 \\\\",
    "\\frac{dz}{dn } = -3z[x^{2}(2-\\omega_{m } ) + \\omega_{m } ( 1-y - z ) ] \\\\",
    "\\frac{ds}{dn } = -\\sqrt{6 } xs^{2}f(s)\\\\   \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where we have introduced another dynamical variable related to the self interacting potential of the scalar field as @xmath33 with @xmath34 and the independent variable is chosen as @xmath35 .",
    "+ in deriving the above autonomous system of ordinary differential equation we choose the interaction to be in the form @xmath36 , with @xmath37 as the coupling parameter .",
    "usually , in the literature @xmath37 is chosen to be positive .",
    "this indicates that there is energy flow from de to dm , as required to alleviate the coincidence problem and to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "hence in view of coincidence problem , the positive coupling is very reassuring . on the other hand , for negative coupling parameter",
    "there is decay of dm into de .",
    "such models allow for the possibility that there is no de field in the very early universe and that de condenses as a result of the slow decay of dm [ 49 ] . also recently",
    ", it has been shown [ 50 ] that the coupling parameter is weakly constrained to negative values by planck measurements .",
    "however , the negative coupling can not be counted to resolve the tension between the planck and hst measurements of the hubble parameter[50 ] .",
    "although , the negative coupling does not help to alleviate the coincidence problem , it appears in the observed data fittings that models with negative coupling show most significant departure from zero coupling .",
    "moreover , from the view point of curvature perturbation , it has been shown that[51 ] when the interaction is proportional to the de energy density , we get a stable curvature perturbation ( except @xmath38 ) while for the choice of the interaction proportional to dm energy density or total energy density of the dark sectors , the curvature perturbation can only be stable when @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the equation of state parameter for de ) . + further , using the normalized variables into the first modified friedmann equation , we obtain the density parameter for the dark matter as @xmath41 due to the energy condition @xmath42 , the normalized variables are not independent but are restricted by the relation @xmath43 also the ratio of the total energy density to the brane tension is given by @xmath44 from the above relation we see that the early super dense region @xmath45 i.e. neighborhood of initial singularity corresponds to @xmath46 while @xmath47 indicates late time cosmological solution when @xmath9 ( i.e. low energy regime ) .",
    "but the explicit form of the autonomous system shows that @xmath46 is not allowed by the system i.e. our model is not appropriate to describe the dynamics near the initial singularity ( possibly quantum effects will be appropriate ) .",
    "however , from mathematical point of view the neighborhood of this initial singularity may be reached in the limiting sense ( i.e. asymptotically ) .",
    "thus the phase space of the above autonomous system can be described as @xmath48\\ ] ] with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "further , the cosmological parameters related to the scalar field namely the equation of state parameter ( @xmath54 ) and the density parameter @xmath55 can be expressed by the newly defined variables as @xmath56 also the deceleration parameter has the explicit form @xmath57\\ ] ]",
    "the system of equations ( 8) forming an autonomous dynamical system has the following eleven critical points , which can be classified as : + i. * critical points * : @xmath58 , @xmath59 + ii . * curves of critical points * : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62    \\iii . * classes of critical points * : @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 + where @xmath68 is a solution of @xmath69 and @xmath70 . note that as @xmath71 so for the existence of the critical points @xmath72 and @xmath73 we must have @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "in other words , the fluid should not be ultra relativistic stiff fluid and the energy exchange should be in the reverse way for the critical points @xmath72 and @xmath73 to exist .",
    "these critical points and relevant physical parameters at those points are shown in table i.    .",
