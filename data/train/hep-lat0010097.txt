    "for over a decade there has been a lot of interest in performing numerical simulations of strongly correlated fermionic systems . a recently discovered method for solving the sign problem inherent in such simulations",
    "is the meron - cluster algorithm @xcite .",
    "a new reference configuration allows us to explore a larger class of models with this method .",
    "the model we study here is a variant of the attractive hubbard model .",
    "the attractive hubbard model has recieved a lot of attention as a toy model for superconductivity .",
    "it is a very simplistic model since the attraction between fermions is explicitly included , instead of arising from some more subtle mechanism . in that respect",
    "it is perhaps more closely related to the case of color superconductivity in qcd .",
    "it is still useful as a model for high-@xmath1 superconductors since at intermediate attraction strength they both exhibit pairing at temperatures above the superconducting transition @xcite .    despite the hubbard model s simplicity , numerical attempts to verify the properties of a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition are inconsistent @xcite .",
    "the main reason seems to be the fairly small lattice size restriction imposed by conventional fermionic monte carlo methods .",
    "since the meron - cluster algorithm scales very efficiently with lattice volume , we are able to go to large system sizes needed to accurately test finite size scaling formulas",
    ". another advantage comes from performing the simulation directly in the fermion occupation basis , thus allowing very simple access to a wide range of observables .",
    "we study a model of fermions with spin on a lattice in two spatial dimensions .",
    "the hamilton operator can be written as @xmath2 with a nearest neighbor interaction @xmath3 \\nonumber \\\\   & + & 2 ( 1+\\delta ) \\left[\\vec s_x \\cdot \\vec s_y +   \\vec j_x \\cdot \\vec j_y \\right ]   - 4\\delta j_x^3 j_y^3 \\nonumber",
    "\\\\   & -&4\\left[(n_{x,\\uparrow}-\\frac12)(n_{x,\\downarrow}-\\frac12 )    + \\frac\\delta4\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\   & \\times&\\left[(n_{y,\\uparrow}-\\frac12)(n_{y,\\downarrow}-\\frac12 )    + \\frac\\delta4\\right ] \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and an on - site term @xmath4 we also define the number operators @xmath5 along with the on - site spin @xmath6 and pseudo - spin operators @xmath7 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the term containing @xmath8 serves to bind the fermions with opposite spin together on a lattice site . in the limit as @xmath9",
    "the model becomes bosonic and can be mapped onto the anisotropic quantum heisenberg model .",
    "as @xmath8 decreases the model becomes increasingly fermionic , as in the attractive hubbard model .",
    "however , at @xmath10 we still have a strongly interacting system due to the additional terms present .     and @xmath11.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    -1.2 cm    -0.4 cm [ pcu8 ]     and @xmath11.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    -1.2 cm    -0.4 cm [ pcu0 ]    in spite of these additional factors",
    ", we still expect this model to behave similarly to the attractive hubbard model since they both possess the same symmetries .",
    "the important symmetries are the @xmath12 spin group generated by the standard fermionic spin operator @xmath13 , and the @xmath14 charge symmetry generated by the pseudo - spin operator @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath12 group is always a symmetry of the hamiltonian , but the @xmath14 group is broken down to the @xmath16 particle number group if either @xmath17 or @xmath18 are nonzero .",
    "the remaining @xmath16 symmetry can then undergo a kosterlitz - thouless transition in two dimensions .    here",
    "we will only consider the case where the @xmath14 is broken by @xmath19 at half filling ( @xmath20 ) as a test of the model and our simulations .",
    "we will study the more physically relevant case of @xmath21 elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the meron - cluster algorithm uses clusters in the standard path integral formulation of a quantum model to solve the sign problem arising from fermion permutations .",
    "it has been presented in detail for a variety of models @xcite . here",
    "we will only outline the extension to this model .",
    "we chose this particular model because of its simple cluster rules .",
    "the clusters are formed identically for the spin up and spin down fermions .",
    "we can thus group all the clusters into pairs that are identical except for having different spin . flipping both clusters to be in the same orientation",
    "then gives an identical fermion sign for each spin sector , thus canceling each other out .",
    "no matter how the clusters are shaped , we can always flip them to be in a `` reference configuration '' with both spin sectors identical , which will always have a positive contribution to the partition function .",
    "the on - site attraction term proportional to @xmath8 is implemented with an extra on - site plaquette similar to the mass term in the previously studied staggered fermion model @xcite . here",
    ", however , the extra link can either do nothing , or it can freeze two clusters of different spin together in the same orientation . if frozen together the clusters can still be flipped , but both spin sectors must be flipped together . note that this frozen state is consistent with the reference configuration which allows us to include it in the meron - cluster algorithm .",
    "this also limits us to studying an on - site attraction in this model since a repulsion would need to freeze the clusters in opposite orientations which is contrary to the reference configuration .     and",

    "we simulated the model presented above using a variant of the implementation used in @xcite .",
    "we have been able to simulate systems with a spatial volume ( v ) of @xmath22 , but we will only present results of up to @xmath23 here .",
    "each simulation produced between @xmath24 and @xmath25 configurations after performing at least @xmath26 thermalization sweeps . in all cases we measured the autocorrelation time to be less than two configurations .",
    "the transition to a state with long range order can be seen in the s - wave pair correlation @xmath27\\ ] ] with @xmath28 in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath29 ) , the pair correlation should diverge near a kt transition as @xmath30 with @xmath31     and @xmath11.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    -1.2 cm    -0.4 cm [ wnu0 ]    figures [ pcu8 ] and [ pcu0 ] show the pair correlation for @xmath32 and @xmath10 respectively . in both cases",
    "we can clearly see evidence of long range correlations forming .",
    "here we do not see much of a difference between the nearly bosonic ( @xmath32 ) and fermionic ( @xmath10 ) model , only a slight shift in the critical temperature .",
    "one could attempt to extract @xmath1 from fitting the pair correlation for the largest volume available to the above form for @xmath33 .",
    "this generally turns out to be difficult due to the large volumes necessary to approximate @xmath33 near @xmath1 .    an easier way of measuring @xmath1 comes from the helicity modulus @xcite which can be defined in terms of the winding number as @xmath34 where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is the total number of particles winding around the boundary in the x ( y ) direction .",
    "this is very convenient to work with since we know the finite size scaling form to be @xmath37 \\label{fsshm}\\ ] ] with @xmath38 . in figures [ wnu8 ] and [ wnu0 ]",
    "we show the quantity @xmath39 for the two different values of @xmath8 . here",
    "we can clearly see the tendency of a universal jump between 0 and 2 at @xmath1 .",
    "near @xmath1 we can fit the helicity modulus for several volumes to ( [ fsshm ] ) to get the two parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we see that the coefficient @xmath40 moves approximately linearly through 1 as @xmath42 goes through @xmath1 . by fitting a straight line to @xmath40",
    "we can determine @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath32 we estimate that @xmath43 while for @xmath10 we get @xmath44 .    for @xmath11 with @xmath9 our model maps onto the quantum xy model with an extra factor of 1/4 multiplying the temperature . scaling the measured result for the xy model @xcite",
    ", we should get @xmath45 for large enough @xmath8 .",
    "our result for @xmath32 is consistent with this which provides a good check of our simulations .",
    "we also see that @xmath32 is indeed close to the bosonic limit .    ) and fermionic ( @xmath10 ) limits.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    -1.2 cm    -0.4 cm [ pf32 ]    we can better understand how the model changes as we adjust @xmath8 by measuring the pairing fraction which we define as @xmath46 in figure [ pf32 ] we show the pairing fraction for both @xmath32 and @xmath10 versus the reduced temperature @xmath47 using @xmath1 as determined above . here",
    "we can distinctly see the effects of the on - site attraction . for @xmath32",
    "the pairing fraction gradually increases as @xmath1 is approached from above and comes within a few percent of its value at @xmath1 well before the kt transition .",
    "for @xmath10 we see a more dramatic rise as @xmath1 is approached from above . here the pairing fraction levels off much closer to @xmath1 than for @xmath32 , but still just before the transition .",
    "we have efficiently simulated a fermionic model with the same symmetries as the attractive hubbard model . in this model",
    "we observed a kt transition at a finite temperature for @xmath11 in the bosonic ( u=8 ) and fermionic ( u=0 ) limits . by measuring the helicity modulus",
    ", we were able to easily obtain the critical temperature .",
    "in the future we will include a chemical potential in our simulations .",
    "this will allow us to move away from half filling .",
    "we also plan to study this model in 3 dimensions to observe the physics of massless goldstone bosons .",
