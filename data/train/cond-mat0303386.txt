    "one quantity of interest is the shift quantum number @xmath7 associated with the cyclic shift symmetry of the rings . using the sign rule of marshall and peierls @xcite or equivalently the theorems of lieb , schultz , and mattis",

    "nevertheless , even for frustrated rings with odd @xmath5 astonishing regularities are numerically verified .",

    "it is a legitimate question whether the k - rule holds for heisenberg spin rings only or whether it is valid for a broader class of spin hamiltonians . in order to clarify this question we investigate the following xxz - hamiltonian @xmath36 for various values of @xmath37 .",
