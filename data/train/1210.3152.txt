    "boron clusters exhibit novel properties and have wide range of applications , from hydrogen storage to chemical ligands.@xcite the ability to form structures of any size makes boron different from other elements .",
    "recent reports have shown that the planar boron clusters are analogous to hydrocarbons with both @xmath1 and @xmath2 aromaticity.@xcite for example , wheel shaped b@xmath3 , shows chemical bondings similar to [ 10]annulene(c@xmath4 ) and coronene(c@xmath5).@xcite ab initio study of another planar cluster , b@xmath6 , reveals that this cluster act as a wankel motor , i.e. the outer ring rotates in opposite direction as that of the inner , when shined with circularly polarized light .",
    "@xcite    in this report , we present a theoretical calculation of optical absorption spectra of the most stable planar isomers of b@xmath0 cluster . since , conventional mass spectrometry alone can not distinguish between the isomers of a given cluster ; our results will be useful in identifying the different isomers , with the help of the computed absorption spectra .",
