    "it is commonly accepted that on the scale of the strong interaction , which is responsible for nuclear integrity and compactness , the large nuclei have a macroscopically finite size and a well - defined boundary .",
    "this size can be physically measured in the rest frame of a nucleus , and it undergoes the lorentz contraction in the moving frame without any physical limitations ( as is required by special relativity ) . in this paper , we suggest to take this fact as a guideline , and explore the consequences of the finite size of the nuclei for the _ quantum process _ of their collision at ultrarelativistic energies . of these consequences ,",
    "the most important is the change of the symmetry : the incoming nuclei are prepared in a homogeneous space having a given energy and momentum .",
    "the fixed space- time point of the first interaction corrupts the initial symmetry , and enforces a different choice of the conserved quantum numbers for the later stages .",
    "of the ten symmetries of the poincar group , only rotation around the collision @xmath0-axis , lorentz transformation along it , and the translations in the transverse @xmath1 and @xmath2-directions survive . therefore , it is profitable to choose , in advance , the set of normal modes which have the symmetry of the localized initial interaction and carry quantum numbers adequate to this symmetry .",
    "these quantum numbers are the transverse components , @xmath3 , of momentum and the boost , @xmath4 , of the particle ( which is associated with the center - of - mass motion and replaces the component @xmath5 of its momentum ) .",
    "these geometric considerations can be reinforced by the quantum mechanical arguments .",
    "indeed , from the perspective of an external observer , the first thing that happens during the collision is a precise measurement , by means of the strong interactions , of the collision coordinate within a very short time interval .",
    "therefore , statistically , by the uncertainty principle , the secondaries with any conceivable momentum @xmath6 can be detected after collision .",
    "this is a well - known scheme of the heisenberg microscope .",
    "the higher resolution we want to achieve , the larger must be the energy resources of the microscope . in the textbook example of the electron probed by the photon , the electron receives energy from the hard photon . in nuclear collisions , both the kinetic energy of the nuclei , and the energy of the compression of the lorentz - contracted nuclei",
    "are used for the purpose of a precise measurement of the coordinate .",
    "an internal observer that penetrates the future of the collision with the nuclei will see a violently expanding matter around him .",
    "the two viewpoints perfectly complement each other .",
    "the short scales of primary interaction provide a sufficient motivation to use the wedge dynamics which describes the fields inside the future domain of the `` wedge '' @xmath7 , and employs the `` proper time '' @xmath8 as a hamiltonian time of the evolution and the coordinate rapidity @xmath9 as a longitudinal coordinate @xcite .",
    "the infamous rapidity plateau persistently observed in high - energy nuclear collisions strongly supports this picture .",
    "the approach advocated in this paper explicitly incorporates the macroscopic finite size of the interacting objects into the quantum theory of the earliest stage of the collision .",
    "we assume that there is no measurable gluon fields outside the large stable nuclei .",
    "consequently , the time moment and the @xmath0 coordinate , along the collision axis , of the first interaction are defined with the accuracy of at least @xmath10 , which is both the size of a lorentz- contracted individual nucleon , and the characteristic scale of color correlation in the @xmath0 direction before the collision .",
    "the full size of the lorentz - contracted gold nucleus at the energy @xmath11 per nucleon is @xmath12 .",
    "we show , that despite an almost infinite lorentz contraction and the quantum nature of the interaction process , the information about the finite size of the incoming nuclei does not fade away .",
    "it remains clearly identifiable in terms of the properly chosen lorentz - invariant variable , _ the boost _ , which is associated with the center - of - mass motion .",
    "thus , it is possible to describe the collision of the two nuclei staying on the same physical ground in any reference frame , either in the reference frame of one of the nuclei , or in the laboratory frame where both nuclei move almost at the speed of light .",
    "the fact that nuclei have finite size is intimately connected with the gauge nature of the strong interactions .",
    "therefore , when addressing the problem of interaction of the two compact nuclei , we must refer to the properties of the vector gauge fields .",
    "the colored sources of these fields must be located inside the nuclei and they can be physically resolved only after the two nuclei overlap .",
    "this is the only assumption we make regarding the internal structure of a nucleus . by all means ,",
    "location of a material object inside a nucleus implies that its center - of - mass should move with this nucleus without crossing its boundary .",
    "therefore , before the collision , it is natural to characterize such an object by its center- of - mass , i.e. , by its boost @xmath13 .",
    "the valence quarks are the first candidates to be considered in this manner . in this sense",
    ", we follow the idea of mclerran - venugopalan model @xcite in the form given by kovchegov and mueller @xcite",
    ". however , we do not try to populate the nuclei with the wee partons .",
    "we think that they are _ gradually created _ in the course of collision @xcite .",
    "the framework of wedge dynamics also offers a unique opportunity to avoid various technical problems encountered when the moving at the speed of light nuclei , @xmath14 , are taken as the first approximation @xcite .",
    "this state can not be reached as a continuous limit of @xmath15 and a significant effort has been made to smooth out the singular behavior of quantum fields at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the wedge form of hamiltonian dynamics is free of this difficulty .",
    "furthermore , the gauge @xmath17 of the wedge dynamics can be fixed completely .",
    "hence , the transverse and longitudinal fields are well separated and the gluon propagators of wedge dynamics have no spurious poles that can stimulate a singular behavior of scattering amplidudes @xcite . in this framework , one can use the same dynamics and the same gauge for the description of both incoming nuclei and the products of their reaction @xcite , thus avoiding all glitches of the `` on - line '' changing the gauge and redefinition the states @xcite .",
    "below , we concentrate on a specific interaction in the expanding system that emerges in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions . it is mediated by the longitudinal part of the gluon field .",
    "it seems to be the leading one at the earliest moments of the collision of the two nuclei , and to result in the intensive color exchanges even in quasi- elastic subprocesses .",
    "eventually , these exchanges must cause an active breakdown of the fragile color coherence of the colliding nuclei and stimulate intense color radiation .",
    "the rate @xmath18 of these color exchanges between the quantum boost states appears to be large at the earliest moments of the collision , and it grows as @xmath19 with the total energy @xmath20 .",
    "this major result of this paper is given by eq.([eq : e2.13e ] ) .",
    "the @xmath19 dependence of the rate on the total energy of the collision resembles the obtained in the early sixties estimate on the maximal rate at which the total cross section may grow with the energy .",
    "it is known as the froissart bound , and a steady growth of the total cross section is indeed observed in the proton - proton collisions .    originally , the froissart bound was derived in the scope of the axiomatic field theory , a powerful approach based on the most general requirements , like lorentz invariance , causality , unitarity , completeness of the basis of physical states and the cluster decomposition principle ( see refs.@xcite for the details ) . since the perturbation theory ( usually _ in a given order _ ) can lead to an anomalously large total cross section ( and thus to apparently violate unitarity ) it is said that the perturbative total cros - section requires unitarization .",
    "recently , this problem received a vigorous attention in connection with the evolution equations for large nuclei at low @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "a physical protection from an excessive growth of cross section due to collinear problems was offered in ref .",
    "@xcite . from this standpoint",
    ", one can infer that the result ( [ eq : e2.13e ] ) of this paper indeed complies with the unitarity .",
    "though this issue has to be studied in more details , we suggest a plausible simple physical arguments below",
    ".    the axioms of unitarity and completeness clearly are not truly ndependent .",
    "discussion of any issue related to unitarity requires that the spaces of the initial and final states are completely specified .",
    "physically , this means that the measurement is not accomplished until its products are analyzed .",
    "what the particular states are , depends on the detectors that resolve these states . in nuclear collisions ,",
    "one can not rely on the conventional `` external '' distant detectors .",
    "the role of the detectors for the earliest subprocesses ( which only very tentatively can be viewed as the independent acts of scattering ) is played by the subsequent interactions .",
    "the next - to - best thing one can do is to try to answer the following question .",
    "let the fields excited at the beginning of the collision are expanded over a system of states characterized by some quantum numbers .",
    "let two such states interact .",
    "what is the rate of these interactions ?",
    "the answer will be related to the two main problems of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "first , the known rate of the primary interaction will help to estimate the entropy production .",
    "at this point , the explicit knowledge of the final states is imperative , because the entropy is the number of the excited degrees of freedom .",
    "second , it will be directly connected to the total cross section . indeed ,",
    "if the fields change their colors during the time @xmath22 with sufficient probability , then the nucleons will lose their coherence and fall apart .",
    "a new composition of hadrons will be created with the probability one , and it does not really matter how the interacting states are chosen . this argument has been tested long ago : the total cross section of the @xmath23-annihilation into hadrons coincides with the cross section of the process @xmath24 .",
    "one of the recently studied examples is the interaction of the eikonalized quarks or gluons @xcite . in this paper , for the same purpose , we consider the `` natural '' states of the wedge dynamics , deliberately leaving the key question of _ what _ interacts at the very beginning of the collision open .",
    "we find that , because the states of wedge dynamics carry internal currents in the coordinate rapidity direction , there exists a specific contact interaction of these currents which grows when @xmath25 , and leads to the amplitude of interaction , proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "[ the contact term in the gluon propagator has been singled out in the course of the complete fixing of the gauge @xmath27 , and its main effect is confined to the nearest vicinity of the light wedge , @xmath28 , where the boundary conditions that fix the gauge are imposed . ]",
    "if the qcd indeed falls under a jurisdiction of the axiomatic field theory ( which by no means is self- evident ) , then our perturbative result , which exactly reaches the froissart bound , may point to the major physical mechanism that triggers the scenario of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : sn1 ] we introduce the variables of wedge dynamics and clarify the physical meaning of the boost in classical and quantum contexts . in section [ sec : sn2 ] we use the boost states to estimate the amplitude of forward scattering with color transfer at the earliest moments of the collision , paying attention to the contact interaction in the expanding system . in appendix",
    "a , we demonstrate that the contact term has no counterparts , and that the standard coulomb - type terms are still there in the propagator .",
    "they are somewhat modified , just in a way which one could expect on purely physical grounds . in appendix",
    "b we show , that the contribution of the other terms into the forward scattering amplitude is subleading .",
    "in this section , we address the basic connection between the classical and quantum aspects of the interaction of compact relativistic objects , in order to prepare the stage for a more involved analysis of the interaction picture .",
    "first , we discuss the role of the classical lorentz boost as a natural variable which , by its origin , is closely related to the finite size .",
    "second , we review the meaning of the boost as a quantum number , and establish its connection with the classical boost . finally , we show that the genuinely classical distribution of the boosts in stable nuclei before the collision plays a role as the initial data for the primary quantum interactions between nuclei .",
    "the wedge form of relativistic dynamics works inside the future domain of the hyperplane @xmath29 ( light wedge ) were the two finite - size ultrarelativistic objects touch each other for the first time .",
    "the natural coordinates inside this domain are parameterized by the proper time @xmath8 and the rapidity coordinate @xmath9 , @xmath30    in terms of these variables , the action for a classical particle is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the spatial velocity squared , and the dot means derivative over the ( hamiltonian ) time @xmath8 . is an exception , it always stands for the rapidity direction ) , and the latin indices from @xmath33 to @xmath34 for the vectors in flat minkowsky coordinates .",
    "we use latin indices from @xmath35 to @xmath36 for the transverse @xmath1- and @xmath2-components ( @xmath37 ) , and the arrows over the letters to denote the two - dimensional vectors , _ e.g. _ , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "the latin indices from @xmath40 to @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) will be used for the three - dimensional internal coordinates @xmath43 on the hyper - surface @xmath44 . ]",
    "the canonical momenta of this particle , @xmath45 are conserved by virtue of the equations of motion .",
    "the hamiltonian is of a standard relativistic form , @xmath46 which , after excluding the velocities , can be rewritten in terms of the canonical momenta , @xmath47 the useful relations of geometric origin , which will be often referred to later on , are @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are the cartesian momenta .",
    "therefore , the boost , @xmath52 is related to the center - of - mass coordinate . according to eq.([eq : e1.5 ] ) , the quantity @xmath53 plays a role as a local longitudinal momentum .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equation for the classical action of a particle reads as @xmath54 it allows for the separation of variables and has a solution @xmath55 in a quantum context , this action serves as the phase of a semi - classical wave function , @xmath56 , with the quantum numbers @xmath13 and @xmath57 , either when @xmath58 or when @xmath59 .",
    "an isolated solution with the not separated variables is @xmath60 it corresponds to a plane wave , and its parameter , the ( momentum ) rapidity @xmath61 , is not a canonical momentum .      in order to understand the physical meaning of the boost variable @xmath13 , the canonical conjugate to the rapidity @xmath9",
    ", one has to figure out how it enters the classical equations of motion .",
    "according to the jacobi theorem , the action @xmath62 , known as a function of coordinates @xmath63 and arbitrary constants @xmath64 , allows one to find an additional set of the conserved quantities , @xmath65 .",

    "the origin of the transverse mass may be different .",
    "it includes both the lagrangian mass and the `` adjoint mass '' due to the transverse momentum . inside a stable nucleus , the momenta most probably characterize the standing waves which are not likely to be too short , if the nucleus is in the ground state .",
    "] then the first of the equations ( [ eq : e1.11 ] ) becomes @xmath75 obviously satisfying the required boundary condition at @xmath28 .",
    "now , it is easy to understand that the quantity @xmath76 is the @xmath8- independent coordinate @xmath77 of the particle in the co - moving frame . by the definition ,",
    "this quantity is lorentz - invariant : the boost @xmath13 is the same in all lorentz frames .",
    "the cartesian form ( [ eq : e1.14 ] ) of the trajectory is obviously continued to all quadrants of the @xmath78 plane .",
    "this classical definition of the boost is fairly operational but , as the reader may notice , it requires that the base world line ( plane ) , from which the coordinate @xmath77 , is measured is explicitly chosen . for the two colliding nuclei ,",
    "it is natural that the base lines ( corresponding to the rapidities @xmath79 ) go through the point @xmath29 , where the nuclei touch each other by their surfaces .",
    "if the nuclei have radius @xmath80 and are built from the fragments of the ( transverse ) mass @xmath81 , then the boosts for the right - moving nucleus will be in the range @xmath82 , and in the range @xmath83 for the left - moving one .",
    "there is no contradiction with quantum mechanics at this point , since the nuclei are _ macroscopic _ stable objects which can be kept under non - destructive control ( in their co - moving reference frames ) before the collision .",
    "asymptotically , they have the well defined rapidities @xmath84 , which can be also measured classically , without any contradiction with the anticipated uncertainty relation , @xmath85 .",
    "indeed , the boosts @xmath86 are measured _ inside _ the nuclei , while the measurements of the velocities of the nuclei is performed by external devices . therefore , the boost variable is indeed perfectly suited for the description of the finite size objects .",
    "if the relative boosts of all constituents do not change in the course of the interaction , then the object remains unaltered in its ( possibly new ) rest frame .    as the matter of fact",
    ", the boosts provide an _ invariant measure _ of the distribution of the constituents of the compact objects .",
    "the picture of rectilinear trajectories holds outside the light wedge also .",
    "therefore , the classically prepared distribution of the boosts is resolved as the distribution of the further interacting quantum states with the given boosts , when two such objects collide .",

    ", the practical measurement of the boost requires that the rapidity @xmath87 is measured at two time moments along the same trajectory .",
    "then , solving the system of two equations ( [ eq : e1.12 ] ) , one finds @xmath13 and @xmath61 , the boost and the asymptotic rapidity of the particle .",
    "it is unrealistic to perform such measurements with sufficient accuracy in the asymptotic domain of the macroscopically large @xmath8 . unlike the case of the macroscopic finite size object",
    ", this kind of measurement does meet quantum - mechanical obstacles .",
    "the quantum - mechanical measurement of the boost @xmath13 is very similar to the measurement of a usual momentum and relies on the definition of the operator of the boost , @xmath88 as the operator of translations in the @xmath9-direction .",
    "then it becomes evident , that a simultaneous measurement of coordinate @xmath9 and momentum @xmath13 is limited by the uncertainty relation , @xmath89    in the field - theory formulation , the boost operator is given by the generator of the lorentz rotations in the @xmath78 plane .",
    "in the internal geometry of wedge dynamics , the boost operator is given by the @xmath90 component of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the boost of the quantum field at the proper time @xmath8 , @xmath91 ( where @xmath92 is the usual angular momentum tensor ) is the integral of motion corresponding to the translation symmetry ( lorentz rotation ) in @xmath9 direction .",

    "indeed , the surface of the light wedge , everywhere except for its vertex , corresponds to @xmath100 .",
    "the wave functions ( [ eq : e1.18 ] ) are connected , by means of fourier transform , with the plane - wave solutions , @xmath101 the saddle point of the fourier transform ( [ eq : e1.20 ] ) ( or its inverse ) is located at the value of @xmath13 ( or @xmath61 ) defined by the relation , @xmath102 corresponding to the classical definition ( [ eq : e1.7 ] ) of the boost .",
    "one can easily see that these wave functions also are semi - classical with the action ( [ eq : e1.10 ] ) , and have a usual momentum ( or the rapidity @xmath61 ) as a quantum number .",
    "these states become localized in rapidity @xmath9 at later times , @xmath103 , and namely these states are most likely to be detected by the expanding collective system .    the key element of the suggested approach",
    "is that the lorentz - invariant boost states , which are independently prepared in the two approaching nuclei , begin to interact as the quantum states only when the nuclei overlap . at this moment , the positions of the nuclei constituents ( classical boosts , which describe the elementary constituents of the nuclei even outside the light wedge ) are translated into the quantum numbers , which define the periodicity of the wave functions in the coordinate rapidity direction .",
    "it is evident , that at the earliest times , the distortion of the initial geometric picture should be only minimal .",
    "therefore , it will be a sufficient approximation to study the transitions into other boost states , and we stay within this approximation until the end of this paper .",
    "the rate at which these early distortions develop appears to be quite large .",
    "the dynamics of boost states preserves the _",
    "invariant information _ about the finite size of the nuclei both in the laboratory frame when each of the two nuclei is contracted up to a negligible small size , and in the rest frame of one of the nuclei ( target ) when the second one ( projectile ) passes through it as a seemingly infinitely sharp shock front .",

    "the propagators of the gauge fields in wedge dynamics were studied in @xcite . in appendix",

    "the leading contribution comes from the spatially local `` contact term '' of the longitudinal part of the propagator . in order to give a flavor of its origin",
