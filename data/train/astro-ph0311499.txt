    "this paper is one of a series whose aim is to develop quantitative models of jets in low - luminosity ( fri ; @xcite ) radio galaxies on the assumption that they are decelerating relativistic flows .",
    "our hypothesis is that the jets are close enough to being intrinsically symmetrical , axisymmetric and antiparallel that the observed differences between them are dominated by the effects of relativistic aberration .",
    "this hypothesis is motivated by the results of @xcite , who presented a statistical study of jets in the b2 sample of radio galaxies and showed that the observed correlations between fractional core flux density and side - to - side asymmetries in intensity and width are consistent with jet deceleration and the presence of transverse velocity gradients .",
    "they inferred that the jets slow from @xmath00.9@xmath1 where they start to expand rapidly to @xmath00.1@xmath1 over distances @xmath21 to 10kpc and that the deceleration scale is an increasing function of jet power . in (",
    "* hereafter lb ) , we demonstrated that an intrinsically symmetrical , relativistic jet model provides an excellent description of the total intensity and linear polarization observed at 8.4ghz from the jets of the fri radio galaxy 3c31 .",
    "we were able to estimate the angle to the line of sight and the three - dimensional distributions of velocity , emissivity and magnetic - field structure . by combining this kinematic model with a description of the external gas density and pressure derived from _",
    "observations @xcite and using conservation of particles , energy and momentum , we demonstrated that the jet deceleration could be produced by entrainment of thermal matter and we derived the spatial variations of pressure , density and entrainment rate @xcite .    the _ free models _ developed by lb for 3c31",
    "were designed to fit the observed images without embodying specific preconceptions about the ( poorly known ) internal physics . in those models",
    ", we adopted simple and arbitrary functional forms for the spatial variations of velocity , synchrotron emissivity and field ordering and allowed the emissivity and field ordering to vary separately as smooth functions of position .",
    "to proceed beyond such purely empirical descriptions of the jets , we must make further assumptions about processes that affect the components of the modelled emissivity  the relativistic particle energy spectrum and the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the separation of the emissivity into its components is ill - determined unless inverse - compton emission can be detected from the synchrotron - emitting electrons , in which case the particle density and field strength can be determined independently .",
    "unfortunately , inverse - compton emission from the inner jets in 3c31 is too weak to detect @xcite .",
    "there are , as yet , no prescriptive theories for dissipative processes such as particle acceleration and field amplification or reconnection in conditions appropriate to fri radio jets .    the energy - loss processes for the radiating particles can be quantified , however .",
    "it is inevitable that the particles will suffer adiabatic losses as the jets expand .",
    "we argue that synchrotron and inverse - compton losses are negligible by comparison for electrons radiating at 8.4ghz in 3c31 , as the jets have accurately power - law spectra with indices close to 0.5 @xcite and show no evidence of spectral curvature until much higher frequencies @xcite .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to compare the observations with models in which the radiating particles are accelerated before entering the region of interest and then lose energy only by the adiabatic mechanism while the magnetic field is frozen into and convected passively with the flow , which is assumed to be laminar . following conventional usage , we refer to such models as _",
    "there are analytical solutions for the adiabatic evolution of emissivity and surface brightness with jet radius and velocity if the magnetic field is exactly parallel or perpendicular to the flow direction .",
    "models of this kind were first considered by @xcite , who showed that the decrease of brightness with distance from the nucleus would be much steeper than he observed in 3c31 if the jets have constant velocity .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the brightness would decline more slowly with distance in a decelerating jet .",
    "this idea underlies the turbulent jet models of @xcite .",
    "a relativistic generalisation was developed by @xcite to model the jets in 3c264 and was applied by @xcite and @xcite to other fri jets .",
    "these treatments all assumed that there is no velocity gradient across the jet , and that the magnetic field is exactly parallel or perpendicular to the flow .",
    "while this approach is self - consistent , it can not be applied if there is velocity shear in a direction perpendicular to any component of the field .    in lb",
    ", we developed a numerical approach to modelling a relativistic jet with a more general magnetic field structure .",
    "this approach allowed us to use the variations of total intensity and linear polarization as independent constraints on the jet velocity field .",
    "we concluded that the magnetic structure and velocity field in 3c31 are indeed significantly more complex than those assumed by @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we compared our models and the data for 3c31 with their analytical solutions .",
    "we showed that :    1 .",
    "the adiabatic approximation is qualitatively inconsistent with the variations of brightness and polarization along the first @xmath03 kpc of the jets , but 2 .",
    "further from the nucleus , the observed variations are closer to those expected if the adiabatic approximation holds .",
    "this comparison motivated us to develop a more general approach to modelling of adiabatic , relativistic jets , which we present in this paper .",
    "our approach allows us to calculate how the brightness and polarization structure evolve along an adiabatic jet from _ prescribed initial conditions _",
    "( specified as profiles across the jet ) , given the jet geometry and more complex magnetic structures and velocity fields of the type inferred for 3c31 by lb .",
    "detailed comparison of the new adiabatic models with the free models of lb , which fit the observations better , can then diagnose whether and where other physical processes , such as particle acceleration , may be significant in the jets .",

    "section  [ obs - mod ] describes our approach to modelling of adiabatic jets ; it briefly recapitulates material from lb before discussing new aspects specific to the present study .",
    "section  [ outer - region ] applies our adiabatic models to the outer regions of the jets in 3c31 and shows that they can give a fair description of the vla observations of these regions .",
    "section  [ whole - jet ] confirms that the adiabatic models fail to describe the inner jet regions and critiques the adiabatic hypothesis in the light of this result ; it also discusses the extent to which distributed particle injection can bring the adiabatic models into better agreement with the data .",
    "section  [ conclusions ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "the jets are taken to be adiabatic in the sense defined by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , as follows :    1 .",
    "the energies of the radiating particles change like those in an adiabatically expanding relativistic gas , i.e.  @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the volume of a fluid element in its rest frame .",
    "there is no diffusion of particles .",
    "3 .   the particle momentum distribution remains isotropic ( e.g.  by resonant scattering off alfvn waves ) .",
    "4 .   the magnetic field behaves as if it is convected passively with the flow .",
    "we take the velocity field to be a smooth function of position .",
    "although the addition of a turbulent velocity component would make little difference to the calculation of the effects of relativistic aberration on the appearance of the jet , there would be a major difference in the strength and structure of the magnetic field , which would be affected by shear and expansion , if not by dynamo action and reconnection .",
    "synchrotron and inverse - compton losses are negligible for electrons radiating at the wavelength of observation , so the energy and synchrotron frequency spectra are always power laws with indices @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . specifically , we take the number density of radiating electrons with energies between @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the jet rest frame to be @xmath9    in addition , we assume , as in lb , that the regions of the jets to be modelled are intrinsically identical , antiparallel , axisymmetric , stationary flows .    the magnetic field @xmath10 is taken to have longitudinal , toroidal and radial components @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( all measured in the jet rest frame ) .",
    "synchrotron radiation is generally anisotropic even in the rest frame of the emitting material . in this paper",
    "we therefore write the emissivity @xmath14 , where @xmath15 would be the emissivity in total intensity for a magnetic field @xmath16 perpendicular to the line of sight ( @xmath17 denotes a spatial average ) .",
    "@xmath15 is the same for all three stokes parameters , but @xmath18 depends on field geometry , and differs for @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 [ for total intensity , @xmath22 and for linear polarization @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the maximum degree of polarization for spectral index @xmath25 .",
    "we now briefly recapitulate the analytical adiabatic relations derived by @xcite for axisymmetric , decelerating , relativistic jets without velocity shear .",
    "suppose that a jet has radius @xmath26 , and that we can make the quasi - one - dimensional approximation : ( a ) that it is uniform in cross - section at a given distance from the nucleus and ( b ) that the velocity is unidirectional .",

    "the emissivity is then : @xmath43 the next subsection develops a numerical approach capable of describing velocity shear .",
    "the formalism needed to predict the total and linearly polarized synchrotron emission from an element of fluid in a non - relativistic adiabatic flow was first developed by @xcite .",
    "their approach was to follow an element of fluid containing relativistic particles and an initially isotropic , disordered magnetic field through a model flow .",
    "they included the effects of synchrotron and inverse - compton energy losses , as well as adiabatic effects .",
    "@xcite developed a simplified approach for the case where synchrotron and inverse - compton losses are negligible , which we follow here .",
    "the reasons for taking the field to be disordered on small scales are discussed by @xcite , @xcite and lb .",
    "an element of fluid is taken to be a unit cube ( much smaller than the spatial scale of variations in the velocity field ) , with sides defined by orthonormal unit vectors @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 along natural axes of the flow in the fluid rest frame",
    ". the cube contains an isotropic disordered field and relativistic particles with the energy spectrum of equation  ( [ eq - energy - spec ] ) and normalizing constant @xmath47 .",
    "the cube moves with the flow , deforming into a parallelepiped with sides defined by the vectors @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "we define a second coordinate system @xmath55 , again in the observed frame , with @xmath56 along the jet axis , @xmath57 perpendicular to it in a plane containing the line of sight and @xmath58 in the plane of the sky .",
    "we parameterize the streamline by an index @xmath59 , which varies from 0 at the inner edge of a flow component to 1 at its outer edge , as in lb . without loss of generality",
    ", we can consider flow in the @xmath60 plane , where the distance of a streamline from the jet axis is @xmath61 .",

    "@xmath63 ( initially radial ) is the only one of the three vectors affected by velocity shear : it is a function of the jet radius and the accumulated path length difference along adjacent streamlines ( fig .  [ abc - evol ] ) .",

    "the total - intensity distribution for the fully - optimized adiabatic model is in much better agreement with the observations .",
    "some of the improvement in @xmath143 results from the requirement to fit the total flux density in the outer region rather than to match the free model exactly at the start of the region .",
    "the model parameters can then be optimized to give a good fit between 11 and 25arcsec from the nucleus , at the expense of an error between 10 and 11arcsec , where the initial decrease of brightness with distance from the nucleus is slightly too rapid , and at distances  25arcsec , where the model intensity is too high ( figs  [ out - contours ] and [ iout - profile ] ) .",
    "the total intensity of the counter - jet is well fitted by this model .",
    "3 .   both adiabatic models predict too high a degree of polarization in the transverse - field region on the axis of the main jet , especially within @xmath010arcsec of the start of the outer region ( fig .",
    "[ out - pgrey ] ) .",
    "conversely , both adiabatic models give slightly too low a degree of polarization on the axis of the counter - jet ( figs .",
    "[ out - contours ] and [ out - pgrey ] ) .",
    "the degree of polarization at the edges of both jets is overestimated , again within @xmath010arcsec of the start of the outer region .",
    "[ out - contours ] and [ out - pgrey ] ) 6 .",
    "the field - vector directions for the fully - optimized adiabatic model are close to those observed , but those for the parameter - matched model are incorrect at the edge of the jet ( where they should be parallel to the surface ; fig .",
    "[ out - contours ] ) .",
    "the problems encountered in fitting the polarization of the outer region with these laminar - flow adiabatic models are fundamental and do not depend on the choice of @xmath103 or the velocity field .",
    "the free models fitted by lb introduce a significant radial magnetic field component , @xmath13 , at the edge of the jet at the start of the outer region to produce the low degree of polarization @xmath151 there .",
    "this field component also reduces the values of @xmath151 on - axis .",
    "the very high degrees of polarization observed at the jet edges further from the nucleus require @xmath13 again to become small compared with the toroidal and longitudinal components @xmath12 and @xmath11 there .",
    "this can not be achieved in our adiabatic models , for which the ratio @xmath162 is fixed by our choice of an axisymmetric velocity field with straight streamlines for the outer region ( the coefficients of @xmath44 and @xmath45 in equations  [ a - eqn - lin ] and [ b - eqn - lin ] are identical ) .",
    "more generally , @xmath162 alters very slowly unless the rate of change of expansion is large : this is a direct consequence of flux - freezing in a laminar velocity field ( equations  [ a - eqn ] and [ b - eqn ] ) . in order to change the ratio ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce a component of velocity across the existing model streamlines .",
    "this component could result from turbulence , for example as a result of entrainment of the external medium .",
    "the reason why @xmath13 disappears in the outer parts of the jets remains unclear .    as a result of the small range of jet / counter - jet sidedness ratio in the outer region ,",
    "the fully - optimized adiabatic models are poorly constrained .",
    "this results in a degeneracy between the velocity and angle to the line of sight : the optimized values of the fiducial velocities @xmath152 and @xmath153 range from 0.33 and 0.16 for @xmath103 = 25@xmath146 to 0.87 and 0.43 for @xmath103 = 70@xmath146 . for the best - fitting model ,",
    "the velocities are 0.71 and 0.34 ( table  [ out - table ] ) .",
    "these are significantly larger than the velocities deduced for the free model ( 0.54 and 0.27 ) and imply faster deceleration .",
    "in addition , the fractional velocity at the edge of the jet is lower ( 0.26 , compared with 0.63 ) .",
    "the combination of these two differences leads to much higher shear at the edges of the jet for the optimized model .",
    "the changes result from a partially - successful attempt to fit the slow brightness decline at the start of the outer region and the apparent magnetic - field direction at the edge of the jet . in effect , the coupling that the adiabatic models require between the variations of the field geometry and the emissivity forces them to steeper velocity gradients in the outer region than those in the best - fitting free model .",
    "we have also investigated the effects of changing the _ functional form _ of the velocity law as well as the parameters .",
    "it is possible to improve the fit to the total intensity by making the velocity decrease more rapidly at the start of the outer region and more slowly at large distances , but this always gives a worse fit to the polarization , and we have been unable to improve the overall @xmath143 .",
    "the parameter - matched model effectively incorporates information gained from free - model fits to the inner jet regions and should therefore provide a much more realistic description of the velocity field , but its predicted brightness distribution initially declines too rapidly with distance from the nucleus ( figs  [ out - contours ] and [ iout - profile ] ) .",
    "particle injection and/or field amplification might occur close to the boundary with the flaring region , thereby slowing the emissivity decline ( cf .",
    "section  [ inject ] ) .",
    "as noted by lb ( section5.4 ) , the conical inner region ( the first 2.5 arcsec of the jet ) shows no evidence for deceleration , but neither does it exhibit the extremely rapid brightness fall - off characteristic of adiabatic expansion at constant speed . the low sidedness ratio observed in this region also led us to suggest that its emission comes mostly from a slow surface layer which does not persist to larger distances .",
    "we have insufficient resolution to build or verify a model of the transverse structure of this region , so we do not consider it further in this paper .",
    "lb showed that the analytical adiabatic approximation of @xcite fails completely for the flaring region .",
    "we now examine whether this conclusion would be modified by including more realistic initial conditions and the effects of velocity shear by modelling the flaring and outer regions of 3c31 , setting the initial emissivity and field - ordering profiles at the boundary between the inner and flaring regions ( @xmath134 ) . as in section",
    "[ outer - region ] , we find that the results for gaussian and ssl velocity profiles are very similar , but that the former fit better , as well as having fewer free parameters .",
    "we therefore again show only the gaussian - velocity case , and compare fully - optimized models with a parameter - matched model whose initial conditions , velocity field , angle to the line of sight and flux scaling are identical to those of the best - fitting free model .",
    "the best fits for the optimized models are much poorer ( @xmath163 ) than those for the free models ( @xmath145 = 1.7  1.8 ) , and also require extremely high velocities at the start of the flaring region . as for the outer region alone ( section  [ outer - region ] )",
    ", solutions of comparable quality can be found over a wide range of angles to the line of sight ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "we show the best - fitting example , which again has @xmath165 .",
    "images of total intensity and linear polarization for the parameter - matched and fully - optimized models are compared with the observations of 3c31 and the best - fitting free ssl model in figs  [ ivec ]  [ ihires ] and the parameters for both models are listed in table  [ params ] .",
    "the main points of interest are as follows .    1",
    ".   the parameter - matched model fails completely to fit the brightness distribution : its initial brightness fall - off is far too steep on both sides of the nucleus .",
    "this confirms our conclusion from the analytical approximation .",
    "the polarization distribution predicted by the parameter - matched adiabatic model is also incorrect , the apparent magnetic field being almost perpendicular to the jets at their edges , rather than parallel as observed .",
    "3 .   the fully - optimized model fits the total intensity from the main jet and the outer counter - jet fairly well ( figs  [ ivec ] , [ iprofile ] and [ ihires ] ) , but seriously underestimates the emission from the counter - jet close to the beginning of the flaring region , where the predicted jet / counter - jet sidedness ratio is @xmath050 , compared with the observed maximum of 13 for the entire region .",
    "4 .   the fully - optimized model shows a qualitatively correct polarization distribution , with transverse apparent field on the axis of both jets and longitudinal field at the edges .",
    "it predicts a higher degree of polarization on - axis in the main jet than in the counter - jet ( opposite to the observed difference ) and also fails to reproduce the regions of low polarization at the edges of both jets and across the whole of the main jet in the flaring region ( figs  [ ivec ] and [ pgrey ] ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    the parameter - matched model fails because there is insufficient deceleration to counteract adiabatic losses resulting from the rapid expansion of the jets in the flaring region , even when field amplification by velocity shear is taken into account .",
    "there is also insufficient shear to counteract the effects of expansion at the edges of the jets , leading to a transverse apparent field there .",
    "the fully - optimized model fits much better , but has two main problems .",
    "first , it requires an extremely rapid deceleration in the flaring region : the initial on - axis velocity @xmath166 is in the range 0.93  0.99 for any @xmath103 and the corresponding velocity at the edge of the jet is 0.7 , so high sidedness ratios are inevitable .",
    "second , as in the outer region , the polarization data require far larger a change in the ratio @xmath162 than is allowed in our axisymmetric , laminar adiabatic model : a significant radial field component must first be generated at the edge of the flaring region and then destroyed further from the nucleus .",
    "the extremely high sidedness ratios required by the optimized adiabatic models are inconsistent with observations .",
    "to help adiabatic models fit the data using the more realistic velocity field of the free models , additional emissivity must be introduced in the flaring region , as we now discuss .",

    "our modelling approach lets us estimate the rest - frame emissivity and the field - component ratios , but it can not disentangle the roles of particles and magnetic field in the absence of any constraint from inverse - compton emission .",
    "the observation of x - ray emission from the inner and flaring regions shows that fresh relativistic particles must be injected there , as the synchrotron lifetimes of electrons radiating at these frequencies are @xmath210 s of years @xcite .",
    "we therefore investigate a simple , but self - consistent physical model in which new ( e.g. reaccelerated ) particles with an energy distribution @xmath170 are added in a distributed fashion over the flaring region and then evolve adiabatically .",
    "we again fix the angle to the line of sight and velocity field at the best - fitting free model values , and assume that the magnetic field is frozen into the flow .",
    "we then optimize the initial conditions and particle injection function .",
    "we parameterize the particle injection as the ratio of the additional emissivity at position @xmath171 in the flaring region to its value on the same streamline at the start of the region , using the empirical relation : @xmath172^{-q}\\ ] ] for @xmath173 ( the emissivity function @xmath97 is defined in section  [ assumptions ] ) .",
    "this means that the transverse injection profile is a constant gaussian function .",
    "the parameters @xmath169 , @xmath20 and @xmath168 are optimized , with @xmath174 restricted to @xmath175 .",
    "the fit to the total - intensity distribution is generally good ( figs  [ ivec ] , [ iprofile ] and [ ihires ] ) , but the jet / counter - jet sidedness ratio close to the boundary between the inner and flaring regions is still significantly higher than is observed , despite the more modest velocity there .",
    "the reason is that the field is almost purely longitudinal , so the ratio is @xmath176^{3 + 2\\alpha}$ ] @xcite rather than the usual @xmath177^{2+\\alpha}$ ] appropriate for a field which is closer to isotropy .",
    "given that the assumed magnetic - field evolution is unchanged , it is not surprising that the deficiencies in the polarization fits noted earlier are still present ( figs  [ ivec ] and [ pgrey ] ) and that an unrealistic field structure is required at the start of the flaring region .",
    "we do not , therefore , regard the high sidedness ratio as a significant problem for the model .",
    "the fit to the total intensity in the outer region is very similar to that of the parameter - matched model described in section  [ outer - region ] , as expected , so the need for some additional emissivity there remains .",
    "the overall fit is slightly worse than for the fully - optimized model ( @xmath178 compared with 4.7 ) , but with 10 free parameters instead of 14 .",
    "the optimized parameters for the particle - injection model are given in table  [ params ] .",
    "key implications are as follows :    1 .   particle injection is required out to 6.4arcsec ( 2.2kpc ) from the nucleus , i.e.  only over the first half of the flaring region . in the second half of the region , the jet decelerates rapidly , thereby slowing the brightness decline predicted by adiabatic models .",
    "further particle injection there would produce too slow a decline in brightness .",
    "the injection rate decreases rapidly with distance from the nucleus within that region .",
    "the emissivity everywhere in the flaring region is dominated by particles injected locally rather than those originating from the inner region .",
    "given the short synchrotron lifetimes of the electrons responsible for the high - energy emission , x - rays are likely to be produced close to the injection sites and the x - ray emissivity might therefore be expected to be roughly proportional to the injection function , @xmath179 , rather than to the radio emissivity .",
    "a comparison between the observed x - ray and radio emission profiles ( @xcite , lb ) and a model profile derived on this assumption ( fig .  [ xray - inject ] ) supports this idea .",
    "the brightest x - ray emission comes from the inner 2.5arcsec of the jet , which we have not modelled , but for which non - adiabatic evolution is clearly required ( section  [ inner - jet ] ) . in the first half of the flaring region , where we infer the need for significant particle injection , there is indeed evidence for more x - ray emission than in the outer half of the region , where injection is not required .",
    "the x - ray data in the flaring region are , however , too noisy to be sure whether the ratio of x - ray to radio emission changes within this region as our particle - injection model predicts .",
    "we also note that high - resolution studies of x - ray and radio emission from jets have shown that both may be highly inhomogeneous , with a complex mutual relationship @xcite .",
    "if particles are indeed injected without much modifying the magnetic field , the ratio of particle to field energy is likely to increase ( by an amount which we can not estimate without a proper description of the injection mechanism ) .",
    "we would not , therefore , expect equipartition between field and particle energy everywhere in the flaring region , even if it holds in some locations .",
    "the region where we infer significant particle injection is also where the expansion rate of the jet is increasing ( fig .",
    "[ geom - sketch ] ) and is where @xcite inferred a significant over - pressure ( fig .",
    "[ xray - inject]b ) .",
    "the internal pressure significantly exceeds not only the external gas pressure , but also the synchrotron minimum pressure , so quite large deviations from equipartition could occur between 2.5 and @xmath05arcsec from the nucleus . in any case , we know that the magnetic field component ratios change in a way which is inconsistent with flux freezing in a laminar velocity field , so it is very likely that amplification of the field also occurs .",
    "all of these results are consistent with injection ( or reacceleration ) of radiating particles over a wide energy range in the first half of the flaring region .",
    "the x - ray - emitting particles have extremely short synchrotron lifetimes and radiate where they are injected , whereas the lower - energy , radio - emitting particles suffer mainly adiabatic losses and radiate over the outer parts of the jet , as we have calculated .",
    "a quantitative study of the acceleration and energy - loss processes over the entire energy spectrum is outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "we have investigated the hypothesis that the radio jets in 3c31 can be modelled as adiabatic , decelerating , relativistic flows .",
    "our technique has several advantages over previous work in : modelling linear polarization as well as total intensity ; including the effects of velocity shear ; taking account of anisotropic emission in the rest frame and fitting to two - dimensional images rather than to longitudinal profiles .",
    "we have found that optimized adiabatic models give a fair description of the observed brightness and polarization distributions in the outer parts of the modelled region .",
    "their fit to the data is inferior to that of the free models of lb , but is obtained with many fewer free parameters .",
    "the adiabatic models can not describe the inner or flaring regions of the jets in 3c31 , however : the predicted distributions of total intensity and linear polarization are inconsistent with those observed . in the innermost region ,",
    "the jets are clearly non - adiabatic unless the emission comes primarily from a part of the jet volume which is not expanding with distance from the nucleus ( we do not resolve the region transversely ) . in the flaring region , a much higher initial velocity is required than is allowed by our measurements of jet / counter - jet sidedness ratio . the emission in this region is well resolved , and comes from the entire jet volume .",
    "we have shown that a modified adiabatic model can still be fitted to the total intensity in this region if we add distributed injection of relativistic particles which then evolve adiabatically ; the region where these particles must be injected is also one where there is independent evidence for recent particle acceleration from the detection of x - ray synchrotron radiation @xcite and of a local over - pressure in the jet from dynamical arguments @xcite .    while the total intensity distributions in the jet and counter - jet of 3c31 can be reproduced satisfactorily by decelerating adiabatic jet models with particle injection in the flaring region , the polarization data ( degree of linear polarization and apparent magnetic field direction ) can not .",
    "the apparent magnetic field configuration contains several features that are qualitatively incompatible with adiabatic evolution of all the field components in laminar - flow models , even in the presence of a velocity shear .",
    "we infer that the departures from adiabatic conditions in 3c31 must also include deviations either from the flux - freezing description of the magnetic fields or from a laminar , axisymmetric velocity field .",
    "the free models of lb achieved better consistency with the observed polarization structure by allowing the field to become roughly isotropic at the edges of the jet in the flaring region . this could be achieved by a turbulent velocity component even if the field is frozen into the flow , in which case the resulting shear would also contribute to the enhancement in emissivity required to fit the adiabatic models in the flaring region .",
    "processes such as dynamo action or field - line reconnection might also be significant .",
    "more detailed analysis of the particle injection process inferred for the flaring region would benefit from more sensitive x - ray , optical and infra - red data and higher - resolution radio observations of this region , i.e.  from deeper exposures with _",
    "chandra _ and _ hst _ and from deep higher - resolution polarimetry with the evla .",
    "improved knowledge of the intensity and apparent magnetic field structures within this region might also assist development of models for the magnetic field microphysics in this region of the 3c31 jet , which all of our analysis suggests is crucial in determining the deceleration dynamics of the jet , and its brightness and polarization properties further from the nucleus .",
