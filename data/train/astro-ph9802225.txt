    "the nature of the bright @xmath0-ray source geminga remained elusive from the first observations using sas - b ( @xcite ) until its recognition as a pulsar with a period of 0.237 seconds in @xmath0 rays ( @xcite @xcite ) and in x - rays ( @xcite ) . based upon colour considerations an optical candidate was proposed , g \" with a m@xmath3 of 25.5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this star had a measurable proper motion ( @xcite ) indicating a probable distance of about 100 pc and thereby making a probable association with a neutron star .",
    "subsequent hubble space telescope observations have given a distance based upon parallax of @xmath4 pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "optical observations in b showed geminga to be fainter than 26th magnitude ( @xcite ) - a result confirmed by hst observations ( @xcite ) . in v geminga is brighter at 25.4 .",
    "this aspect of the spectrum has been explained by a proton cyclotron feature causing either preferential emission in v or absorption in b and i ( @xcite ) superimposed on a thermal continuum .",
    "however , re - analysis of the euve and rosat datasets highlight an error in this earlier work , indicating that the thermal continuum would not be expected to dominate in the optical regime , based on the observed flux ( @xcite ) . such an apparent absorption feature has been previosuly observed in the crab spectrum ( @xcite ) although not confirmed by other observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent spectral studies of geminga ( @xcite ) show a continuous power - law from 3700 to 8000 (  ) with no such features consequently indicating that a predominantly magnetospheric origin is preferred over a thermal one . it should be noted that these spectroscopic studies were at the limit of the observational capabilities of the keck and with a low signal - to - noise ratio .    of crucial importance to",
    "the understanding of neutron star structure is the stellar radius .",
    "this can in principle be inferred once the distance and the black - body contribution has been measured ( @xcite ) .",
    "however determining the black - body component of an isolated neutron star is complicated by magnetospheric and possible atmospheric effects ( @xcite ) . as geminga is very nearby it is a prime candidate for measuring the thermal component - crucial to this will be the removal of the magenetospheric component of its emission .",
    "this is possible by determining what contribution of the optical emission is pulsed and whether it follows the hard ( magnetospheric ) or soft ( presumed thermal ) x - ray emission profile .",
    "the faintness of the optical counterpart has precluded time - resolved observations using conventional photometers . however by using 2-d photon counting detectors , the required astrometric analysis can be carried out off - line .",
    "consequently photon arrival times can be measured from a reduced ( seeing optimised ) aperture diaphram .",
    "observations were made on 25th and 26th february 1995 using the 3.55 m new technology telescope ( ntt ) at la silla .",
    "follow up observations were taken in january 1996 , using the 6 m telescope ( bta ) of the special astrophysical observatory over three nights .",
    "two mama detectors were used ; one a b extended s-20 ( @xcite ) and the other a bialkali ( @xcite ) photocathode . by using the ucg triffid camera ( @xcite ) to record the data .",
    "the arrival time and position of each photon was recorded to a precision of 1 @xmath5second and 25 microns .",
    "the spatial resolution was equivalent to 0``.13 on the ntt and 0''.25 on the bta .",
    "absolute timing was achieved using a combination of a gps receiver , which gave utc to a precision of 400nsec every 10 seconds , and an ovened 10mhz crystal which was accurate to @xmath6 1 @xmath5second per 10 second interval . on each night",
    "the crab pulsar was observed for calibration purposes . using a crab timing ephemeris ( @xcite ) the barycentric phase of the crab pulse was determined ;",
    "phase was maintained to within 10 @xmath5seconds over the whole period .",

    "the images could be marginally improved by removing the effects of telescope movement ( @xcite ) .",
    "these images were compared with hst / wfpc2 archival images to determine the position of geminga at these epochs .",
    "after coaddition of all the b and v images from january 1996 , a faint star could be seen at the expected position of geminga .",
    "no such object could be seen in the february 1995 data .",
    "the reason for this was two fold : firstly the exposure time - telescope aperture product was 5 times greater in 1996 compared to 1995 and secondly the flat - fields were deeper in the later observations .",
    "once the position of geminga was established , the photons times were extracted from a window , centred on geminga , with a diameter corresponding to the average seeing widths for each exposure . this was chosen to maximise the signal to noise ratio .",
    "these extracted times were then translated to the solar system barycentre using the jpl de200 ephemeris .",
    "the geminga arrival times were folded in phase using the egret ephemeris ( @xcite ) for each colour and for each observing run .",
    "3.3truein    3.3truein    figure 1 shows the light curve in b for each night of january 1996 and figure 2 shows the combined light curve .",
    "figure 3 shows the time resolved images in b for 4 phase bands as indicated .",
    "clearly geminga can be seen during the two on phases ; star g is to the top right .",
    "we note that background fluctuations are consistent with the expectations of poissonian statistics .",
    "table 2 shows the determined pulsed magnitude or 1 sigma upper limits where appropriate .",
    "this type of light curve is best analysed using the @xmath8 statistic ( @xcite ) .",
    "only the january 1996 b data shows significant pulsations - the @xmath9 statistic for this data set ( of 20.6 ) has a significance of 99.96% . in the january 1996 v data a weak signal , with a similar form ,",
    "can also be observed .",

    "no significant signal was observed in february 1995 - mainly due to the smaller telescope aperture .",
    "given these considerations the upper limits of our data are consistent with the level of pulsations remaining constant . in order to estimate the pulsed fraction the background level had to measured .",
    "for each data set the background was determined as the mean of the signal in a small annulus , of radius 2``.5 and width 0''.25 around the position of geminga .",
    "the magnitude calibration was achieved using the star g ( @xcite ) which was always in the field of view .",
    "our measured pulse fraction is consistent with 100% , but , we should stress that there is a large error in this value , due to uncertainties in measuring the sky background , as seen in figure 2",
    ". we can however give a @xmath13 upper limit to the unpulsed component of @xmath14 .",
    "our results agree qualitatively with the previously observed optical flux , but the form of the optical light curve resembles the @xmath0 and hard x - ray rather than the soft x - ray signature , implying a magnetospheric origin . in @xmath0-rays the spectrum is double peaked with maxima at phases 0.25 and 0.75 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the soft x - ray is characterized by a sinusoidal modulation consistent with thermal emission with two temperatures ( @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath18k ) or from a single thermal source and a power spectrum ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "euve satellite observations , albeit with low significance , indicate that the extreme uv timing profile is similar in shape to the soft x - ray light curve .",
    "recent reported detections of radio emission ( @xcite , @xcite ) do not show a consistent pulse profile pattern and geminga s radio emission is still a topic of some debate . however the phase agreement of the @xmath0-ray light curve with the radio profile of kuzmin and losovskii , using the egret ephemeris , would suggest that peak 2 corresponds to direct polar emission as reported in their paper . when this is combined with the doubled pulsed optical , hard x - ray and @xmath0-ray profile we can attempt to constrain models for the high energy emission .",
    "the high energy pulses are about 0.5 phase apart which rules out a geometry similar to the crab pulsar .",
    "it would seem that geminga has a magnetic axis at about @xmath19 to the rotation axis , with the emission sites situated close to the neutron star surface .",
    "interestingly when we fold our data , using the malofeev and malov ephemeris , one of the optical pulse peaks arrives at phase zero - expected from most emission models where phase zero generally corresponds to the radio peak .",
    "what is not clear is why the malofeev and malov pulse is delayed to phase 0.4 .",
    "from figure 2 we can see that the signal shows two peaks with a phase separation of @xmath20 0.5 .",
    "we can understand this in terms of the extrapolation of the pulsed @xmath0 emission to optical wavelengths , which is valid for the crab pulsar .",
    "@xmath0-ray emission from geminga has been suggested to be variable ( @xcite ) in both total intensity and spectral index .",
    "our optical observations are within the spread of variation and wide dispersion from the higher energy points ( @xcite ) .",
    "halpern & wang s more recent analysis fitted the x - ray and hard uv data to a black - body spectrum ( t @xmath21 k ) with a power law . the low energy extrapolation of their black - body fit would produce an optical flux 2 magnitudes fainter than we observe , whilst the power law would produce a flux @xmath22 5 magnitudes brighter . as with the crab pulsar this points to a probable flattening of the spectrum in the uv region .",
    "we should also note this extension from the x - ray to the optical does not require a proton cyclotron feature ( @xcite ) to explain the v data but it might imply that there is preferential absorption in i. this could be due to a number of processes including electron cyclotron resonance scattering or synchrotron self - absorption ( unlikely in this instance ) . such a turnoff has been observed spectroscopically in geminga ( @xcite ) albeit with low significance .",
    "as similar i attenuation is observed in both the crab and vela pulsars spectra we are begining to develop an understanding whereby the high energy emission from these objects comes from a similar process .",
    "our results when taken in conjunction with the spectroscopy studies favour an electron synchrotron origin for the radiation at least up to the edge of the b band .",
    "differences can be understood in terms of the viewing geometry and path length over which the electrons are radiated .",
    "deep , phase resolved observations in v , r , i and h will be crucial in determining whether there is a continuum infra - red turnover or whether there is an absorption line .",
    "such observations , including a determination of the pulse fraction , will adequately separate the thermal and non - thermal components with important ramifications for models of pulsar emission .",
    "indeed , the unpulsed components would constrain geminga s thermal continuum , which in conjunction with euve and x - ray data and the known distance would provide definitive estimates , rather than upper limits ( @xcite ) , on the neutron star s size .    _",
