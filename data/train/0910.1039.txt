    "the mechanical performance and failure modes of glassy polymers are strongly affected by strain hardening ; an increase in the stress needed to deform systems as the strain increases .",
    "there has been great interest in understanding the mechanisms of strain hardening so that it can be predicted and optimized for applications .",
    "recent studies have challenged the traditional view that entanglements between polymer chains control strain hardening , and suggest that orientation of individual chains plays the dominant role .",
    "this paper uses simulations of polymer mixtures to separate the roles of entanglements and orientation .",
    "the most widely used @xcite theories of strain hardening are based on rubber elasticity .",
    "they assume that entanglements between polymer chains act like chemical crosslinks in a rubber and that strain hardening arises from the decrease in entropy of an affinely deforming entanglement network @xcite .",
    "the stress is written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the plastic flow stress , @xmath2 the `` strain hardening modulus '' , @xmath3 the stretch tensor describing the macroscopic deformation , and @xmath4 a dimensionless function that describes the reduction in chain entropy .",
    "this approach has had much success in fitting experimental stress strain curves , but the fits seem inconsistent with the underlying microscopic model @xcite .",
    "one difficulty is that @xmath2 is two orders of magnitude larger than expected near the glass transition temperature @xmath5 .",
    "more troubling is that strain hardening grows with decreasing temperature , while any entropic force should decrease .",
    "a final difficulty is that the theory does not explain the plastic flow stress , which must be added by hand .",
    "a number of recent experiments and simulations have examined the origins of these difficulties @xcite .",
    "one realization is that the two terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) are of similar magnitude and must arise from similar mechanisms .",
    "experiment , theory and simulations all show that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are linearly related when pressure , @xmath6 or strain rate is varied @xcite .",
    "this connection explains the large magnitude of @xmath2 and the fact that it grows with decreasing temperature as is typical for the plastic flow stress .",
    "a direct connection between @xmath1 and @xmath2 has been established in the athermal limit ( @xmath7 ) , where both contributions to the stress are given by a single scaling factor times the rate at which interchain bonds break during local plastic rearrangements @xcite .    simulations also show strain hardening occurs in polymers that are too short to form the entangled network that is assumed in rubber elasticity theories @xcite .",
    "moreover , the strain hardening in these unentangled systems can be mapped to that of entangled chains if the macroscopic deformation @xmath8 in eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma ] is replaced @xcite by an effective stretch tensor @xmath9 that describes the orientation of individual chains : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the value of @xmath2 in the long - chain limit .",
    "the orientation of entangled chains is consistent with an affine deformation , @xmath12 . for unentangled systems",
    "the orientation is consistent with a subaffine deformation by @xmath9 .",
    "the above findings support the notion that entanglements play an indirect role and that strain hardening is produced by the increased rate of local plastic rearrangements that are needed to maintain chain connectivity as chains orient @xcite .",
    "in contrast , other recent experiments @xcite suggest that entanglements play a central role .",
    "they find that @xmath2 is directly proportional to the entanglement density @xmath13 in both pure systems and polymer mixtures .",
    "however , there are other explanations for this correlation . for example",
    ", an increase in chain stiffness increases @xmath13 and also stretches the chains so that more plastic rearrangements are required to maintain chain connectivity @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine strain hardening of polymer mixtures . using polymers with different chain lengths but the same interactions , stiffness , etc . , allows us to isolate the roles of entanglements and orientation .",
    "the simulation results show that the orientation of chains plays the dominant role and that the response of mixtures has a surprisingly simple mean - field form .",
    "the variation of chain orientation with macroscopic stretch is nearly independent of the length of surrounding chains .",
    "in addition , the stress in mixtures is a simple weighted average of results for pure systems .",
    "these results suggest that strain hardening can be modeled as a sum of contributions from individual chains as they are deformed by interactions with the surrounding glass and produce local plastic rearrangements in the glass to maintain their connectivity .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations are performed using a coarse - grained bead - spring polymer model @xcite .",
    "all monomers have mass @xmath14 and interact via the truncated and shifted lennard - jones potential @xmath15 \\ \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the cutoff radius and @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",

    "we consider semiflexible chains with an angular potential @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the angle between consecutive bond vectors along a chain .",
    "all quantities are expressed in units of the molecular diameter @xmath25 , binding energy @xmath26 , and characteristic time @xmath27 .",

    "simulations are performed using the same protocols as in refs .",
    "a rapid quench is applied to well - equilibrated melts @xcite , producing glasses at the desired temperature @xmath6 .",

    "also shown is the weighted average of the pure system results @xmath67 for @xmath64 . within our statistical accuracy ,",
    "the stress in the mixtures is equal to this weighted average .",
    "we have verified that this `` stress superposition principle '' holds for different @xmath49 , chain lengths , temperatures and @xmath45 .",
    "the only discrepancies are observed at large @xmath4 ( @xmath68 ) when chains in entangled systems have stretched nearly taut and significant energy is stored in the covalent bonds .",
    "experiments only reach such large stretches when special sample preparation procedures are used @xcite .    equation ( [ eq : sigma ] ) would predict a linear increase in stress with @xmath4 .",
    "the systems in fig .",
    "[ fig : linsuperpos ] were chosen to exhibit deviations from this straight line behavior , but still obey stress superposition .",
    "deviations from linearity in experiments are often fit by including non - gaussian ( finite chain length ) corrections to the network entropy @xcite .",
    "previous simulations are not consistent with this interpretation @xcite .",
    "they show that the upturn in stress for entangled systems reflects energy stored in the glass , while the downward curvature for unentangled systems results from subaffine deformation of the chains ( @xmath69 ) . despite the different curvatures for the long and short chains in fig .",
    "[ fig : linsuperpos ] their contributions to the stress in mixtures are simply additive .",
    "these results do not conflict with experiments that found @xmath2 was proportional to @xmath13 @xcite . for the specific polymers studied ,",
    "the entanglement density of mixtures is a weighted average of pure systems .",
    "thus these systems also obey stress superposition .",
    "it would be interesting to perform similar experiments on polymer mixtures whose entanglement density was a nonlinear function of weight fraction .",
    "the relation between @xmath13 and @xmath45 is nonlinear for the model polymers considered here , yet plots in a previous paper indicated @xmath2 was proportional to @xmath13 @xcite . while this is approximately true for monodisperse systems , the results for mixtures were misinterpreted in this earlier paper .",
    "a factor of @xmath70 was inadvertently excluded in the calculation @xcite of @xmath13 from primitive path analysis @xcite .",
    "when @xmath13 is evaluated correctly , the hardening modulus is no longer proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "however , we do find that the values of @xmath71 from ref .",
    "@xcite satisfy stress superposition .",
    "indeed , the superposition principle explains the success of the previous collapse . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the incorrectly determined value of @xmath13 was proportional to @xmath70 and so the collapse implied @xmath72 as expected from superposition .",
    "the correct @xmath13 is nearly proportional to @xmath73 and not linearly related to @xmath2 .    to understand why the contribution of chains to stress is additive , we examined the changes in molecular conformations during shear .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the orientation was quantified by the effective stretch @xmath59 .",
    "this is defined as the mean stretch of chains along the compression direction ; @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the rms @xmath31-component of the end - to - end vector of a chain and @xmath76 the value before strain .",
    "panel ( c ) shows @xmath77 for short and long chains in the pure and mixed states for the same systems shown in panels ( a - b ) .",
    "remarkably , @xmath78 and @xmath79 do not themselves depend on @xmath45 .",
    "in other words , the orientation of the long ( short ) chains is not dependent on whether they are in a pure system or mixed with a fairly high fraction of short ( long ) chains .",
    "this @xmath45-independence of @xmath59 holds over the same broad range of conditions as the stress superposition principle .",
    "how can we understand the apparent @xmath45-independence of @xmath59 ?",
    "the simplest qualitative picture is that interchain interactions in the glass tend to enforce an affine deformation of the chains , but that this is opposed by intrachain bonds .",
    "chains can not deform affinely at small scales because this would stretch the stiff covalent bonds along the chains .",
    "instead , chains are observed to straighten over an effective persistence length @xmath80 that increases with @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this straightening is independent of chain length until the associated stress becomes large enough to force relaxation of the chain along its length . for the systems considered here ,",
    "the friction with neighboring chains is large enough that significant relaxation does not occur until unentangled chains are stretched to a substantial fraction of their fully extended length .",
    "straightening chains while maintaining their connectivity requires local rearrangements of the surrounding monomers .",
    "the number of rearrangements grows with the persistence length and this was found to correlate directly with the strain hardening at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "note that entanglements do not enter directly in this picture .",
    "since entangled and unentangled chains behave in the same manner at small @xmath81 , the constraints on their rearrangements must be determined by very local interactions with the surrounding matrix .",
    "entanglements only become relevant when @xmath4 is so large that @xmath80 reaches a significant fraction of the separation between entanglements @xcite . in this limit",
    "entanglements become more effective than friction from the matrix in enforcing an affine displacement of the chain .",
    "the associated tension in the chains grows as @xmath80 approaches @xmath82 and contributes significant energetic terms to the strain hardening at large @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "it is worth considering under which conditions this mean field picture should break down . for the reasons just described , the range of validity will be limited to small strains in very densely entangled systems ; fortunately , by this standard , few synthetic polymers are so densely entangled @xcite .",
    "the mean field picture should also break down for extremely short chains where the high density of chain ends changes the density , friction and other properties significantly .",
    "stress superposition will be particularly sensitive to changes in the relaxation rate of chains on the end - end scale , @xmath83 , with @xmath45 .",
    "these are known to be significant for @xmath6 above @xmath5 , where @xmath84 for short chains is increased when they are mixed with longer chains , leading to greater orientation at a given shear rate @xcite .",
    "our results show that such coupled - orientation effects are small deep in the glassy state .",
    "the simulations presented here provide further evidence that strain hardening in polymer glasses depends primarily on chain orientation rather than entanglement .",
    "they also provide new insight into the factors that control the degree of orientation .",
    "the local coupling to the glassy matrix enforces an affine deformation of the chains ( @xmath85 ) at small @xmath81 .",
    "hardening arises primarily from the plastic rearrangements needed to maintain intrachain connectivity as chains orient and are straightened over greater lengths .",
    "as the associated stress on the chains grows , there is an increasing tendency for them to relax along their length , leading to subaffine deformation ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the observation that the value of @xmath59 for a given chain length is independent of @xmath45 and that the stress due to plastic rearrangements obeys the superposition principle , implies that chains relax nearly independently .",
    "the degree of relaxation depends on a competition between the intrachain tension caused by alignment and friction with the glassy matrix .",
    "entanglements only enter at very large @xmath81 where they prevent relaxation of chains that are much longer than @xmath87 .    to our knowledge , no microscopic theory that predicts the functional form of @xmath59 in glasses has been published .",
    "constitutive models which employ a viscoelastic or viscoplastic description of glassy strain hardening ( e.  g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) typically decompose @xmath8 into rubber - elastic and plastic parts ( or use other internal state variables ) , but do not explicitly account for @xmath86 or the @xmath88-dependence of nonaffine relaxation @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to see if a first principles theory like that of ref .",
    "@xcite could be generalized to predict @xmath77",
    ". the qualitative ingredients that must enter such a microscopic theory are evident from the results shown here and in refs .",
    ". simply put , @xmath59 falls behind @xmath60 when the stress in the material is insufficient to further affinely orient the average chain .",
    "fortuitously , @xmath59 can now be accurately measured in scanning near - field optical microscopy experiments @xcite which can discriminate values for different chain lengths in a bidisperse system .",
    "@xcite showed @xmath59 falls behind @xmath60 for entangled chains deformed slightly above @xmath5 ; similar studies on a variety of chain lengths below @xmath5 would be of great interest .",
    "these might prove that @xmath59 is one of the `` mesoscale '' quantities @xcite whose understanding will improve modeling of the deformation of amorphous materials .",
