    "in 1992 nagel and schreckenberg  @xcite introduced a simple cellular automata model , which simulates single - lane one - way traffic , in order to study the transition from free flow traffic to jammed traffic with increasing car density .",
    "the behavior of the model is determined by three parameters , the maximal velocity @xmath2 , the noise parameter @xmath3 and the global density of cars @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the total number of the cars and @xmath6 the system size , respectively .",
    "the variables describing a car @xmath7 at time @xmath8 are its position @xmath9 , its velocity @xmath10 and the gap @xmath11 , which is the number of unoccupied cells in front of the car .",
    "using periodic boundary conditions , the following update steps are applied in parallel for each car : @xmath12    increasing the global density for fixed @xmath3 and @xmath2 jams occur above a certain critical value @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the forward movement of all particles the jammed region is characterized by a backward moving of shock waves , i.e.  jams are nothing else than backward moving density fluctuations .",
    "this property of jams was found in real traffic flow already in the 50 s  @xcite .",
    "investigations of the nagel - schreckenberg traffic flow model show that crossing the critical point a transition takes place from a homogeneous regime ( free flow phase ) to an inhomogeneous regime which is characterized by a coexistence of two phases ( free flow and jammed traffic ) .",
    "thereby , the free flow is characterized by a low local density and the jammed phase by a high local density , respectively . due to the particle conservation of the model the transition",
    "is realized by the system separating into a low density region and a high density region  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the dynamical structure factor is an appropriate tool to investigate the decomposition of the two phases above the transition point .",
    "additionally the dynamical structure factor has the decisive advantage that both phases could be distinguished in a natural way by the sign of their characteristic velocities .",
    "thus no artificial definitions of jams are needed which were used in previous investigations and lead to controversial results  ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "= 6.0 cm = 6.0 cm    the dynamical structure factor is defined as follows : let @xmath14 the evolution of @xmath15 leads directly to the space - time diagram where the propagation of the particles can be visualized .",
    "figure  [ fig : space_time ] shows a space - time diagram of the system above the critical value .",
    "traffic jams are characterized by the backward movement of the high density regions .",
    "the dynamical structure factor @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where the fourier transform is taken over a finite rectangle of the space - time diagram of size @xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : space_time ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_struc_factor ] we plot the dynamical structure factor below and above the transition , respectively .",
    "below the transition @xmath16 exhibits one mode formed by the ridges .",
    "the values of the modes are obtained from a determination of the position of the maxima of @xmath0 for fixed @xmath19 or @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "this mode is characterized by a positive slope @xmath20 corresponding to the positive velocity of the particles in the free flow phase . increasing the global density of the cars , a second mode appears at the transition to the coexistence regime .",
    "this second mode exhibits a negative slope indicating that it corresponds to the backward moving density fluctuations in the jammed phase .",
    "= 10.0 cm = 6.0 cm    = 10.0 cm = 6.0 cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_struc_factor_max ] we plot the position of the ridges of @xmath16 in the jammed regime .",
    "both modes are characterized by a linear dispersion relation ( @xmath21 ) , i.e.  each phase is characterized by one velocity only . since the modes of both phases can clearly be distinguished ( note the logarithmic scale in fig .  [ fig : dyn_struc_factor ] ) and no other mode occur we think that this indicates that above the transition a real phase separation of the system takes place .",
    "this is in contrast to results of previous investigations which examine the steady state correlation function and concluded that there is no real phase separation of the system  @xcite .",
    "= 5.5 cm = 5.5 cm    a linear regression of the modes of fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_struc_factor_max ] yields the velocities of both phases . in fig .",
    "[ fig : velocities ] we plot the velocities of the free flow and jammed phase for different values of @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath22 .",
    "independent of the value of the global density , the free flow phase is characterized by the velocity @xmath23 , i.e.  @xmath24 equals the average velocity of the particles in the limit @xmath25 and the cars can be considered as independent particles .",
    "this agrees with investigations of the local density distribution and the steady state structure factor ( @xmath26 )  @xcite .",
    "the plotted values of the jam velocity @xmath27 are obtained from simulations with @xmath28 and various values of @xmath22 and @xmath2 .",
    "the velocity of the jams neither depends on the global density nor on the maximum velocity .",
    "the jam velocity is a function of the noise parameter only . using the structure of @xmath0 we are able to determine this @xmath3 dependence of @xmath27 for the first time and the results",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : jam_velocity ] .",
    "= 6.0 cm = 6.0 cm",
    "we studied numerically the nagel - schreckenberg traffic flow model .",
    "the investigation of the dynamical structure factor allowed us to examine the transition of the system from a free flow regime to a jammed regime . above the transition the dynamical structure factor exhibits two modes corresponding to the coexisting free flow and jammed phase .",
    "due to the sign of their characteristic velocities @xmath24 and @xmath27 , both phases can clearly be distinguished .",
    "we investigated the dependence of @xmath24 and @xmath27 on the system parameters systematically and found that the jammed velocity depends on the noise parameter only .",
    "the characteristic velocity of the free flow phase turned out to be equal to the velocity of free flowing cars in the low density limit ( @xmath25 ) , i.e. cars of the free flow phase behave as independent particles ."
