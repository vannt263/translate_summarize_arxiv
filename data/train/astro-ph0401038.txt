    "* hereafter t03 ) derived the galactic pl relation by combining the galactic cepheids with independent distance measurements from open clusters / associations @xcite and from the barnes - evans ( be ) surface brightness techniques @xcite .",
    "the resulting galactic pl relations in t03 are steeper than the lmc pl relations commonly applied in distance scale applications ( as in , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similar conclusions are also reported in @xcite .    the need to use the galactic pl relation as a fundamental calibrating relation has become more desirable in recent years @xcite , because of",
    "the following two main reasons : ( a ) the average value of metallicity ( defined as @xmath4 $ ] ) in target galaxies of the @xmath5 key project is @xmath6 @xcite , which is closer to the standard solar value of @xmath7 @xcite than the lmc value of @xmath8 ( see reference in @xcite ) ; and ( b ) there is evidence that the lmc pl relation is broken at 10 days @xcite , i.e. , the short ( @xmath9 days ) and long period cepheids in the lmc follow different pl relations . due to these reasons",
    ", the calibrated galactic pl relation will become important in future distance scale studies .    in this paper",
    ", we derive the galactic pl relation from cepheids with independent distance measurements .",
    "our analysis of the galactic pl relation is similar to t03 but different in the following aspects :    1 .",
    "in addition to the cepheids from @xcite and @xcite that are used in t03 , we include other recent distance measurements to galactic cepheids that are available in the literature ( see section 2 ) .",
    "these include 11 additional cepheids that are not included in t03 .",
    "2 .   as most of the cepheids we considered here",
    "have more than one independent distance measurement , we took the standard weighted - mean of the available distances as the final adopted distance to derive the pl relation .",
    "we collected the galactic cepheids with recent distance measurements from the literature , which include :    1 .",
    "* distances from open cluster techniques * : these distances are adopted from table 3 of t03 , where the authors adopted a distance modulus for the pleiades of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated that the uncertainty associated with cluster distance moduli is @xmath11-@xmath12 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , hence we assign an uncertainty of @xmath12 to the open cluster distance moduli ( @xmath13 $ ] ) in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "this error could incorporate the uncertainty due to the location of the cepheid in the cluster ( far - side vs. near - side ) , the uncertainty due to metallicity corrections from cluster to cluster , etc .",
    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , we also include other open cluster distances from @xcite and @xcite in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "since these additional open cluster distances are based on @xmath14 , we add a correction of @xmath15 to these distances in table [ tab1 ] to be consistent with the t03 open cluster distances .",
    "however , it is unclear whether the distances given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* where the t03 adopted distances originate ) and in @xcite are totally independent to each other or not , since some of them were adopted from the same sources .",
    "for example , the open cluster distances for cv mon in @xcite and @xcite are all adopted from @xcite .",
    "we have labelled the @xcite distances that are dubious in this dependency regard in table [ tab1 ] , and excluded them in obtaining the weighted - mean distances . for gt car , cg cas and tv cma in @xcite , which are not included in @xcite ,",
    "there is no i band data available in the literature .",
    "we exclude them in order to have a consistent number of cepheids in b , v and i bands",
    "* distances from be surface brightness techniques * : we adopt these distances from @xcite , which is an updated version of @xcite , with additional cepheids that are not included in @xcite . fouqu ( 2003 , private communication ) has verified that the the distances from @xcite and @xcite are not independent of each other , as the distances from the later paper use the latest available data to update the distances in @xcite .",
    "the exception is cs vel , where we include the distance from @xcite since there is no distance given to this cepheid in @xcite .",
    "note that t03 only included the distances from @xcite but not from @xcite .",
    "we also include the latest distance measurements using be techniques from @xcite , who used a bayesian statistical approach in their analysis .",
    "* distances from interferometry techniques * : these distances are adopted from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . note that for distances in @xcite , we did not use the direct distance measurements for the four cepheids ( @xmath16 aql , w sgr , @xmath17 dor & @xmath18 car ) because the errors are asymmetric and large ( except for @xmath18 car ) . instead we adopt the distances from their table 12 .",
    "these are obtained from combining the interferometry data and the empirical period - radius relations from @xcite .",
    "* distance from _ hst _ astrometry techniques * : currently there is only one cepheid with a distance measurement from astrometry using the _ hubble space telescope _ : @xmath19 cep from @xcite .",
    "the selected galactic cepheids and the corresponding distances from these sources are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "since these distances are from independent measurements , we can take the weighted - mean among the available distances ( i.e. column 2 , 3 , 5 & 6 in table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "note that t03 only uses the distance moduli in column 2 & 4 of table [ tab1 ] in their paper .",
    "we did not include the distances from _ hipparcos _ because the errors in the distance moduli , after conversion from parallax , are large ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in this work , we exclude all the possible non - fundamental mode cepheids and those not classified as `` dcep '' in the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs , @xcite ) .",
    "some of them are mentioned in t03 , and include : ev sct , v1726 cyg , sz tau , qz nor , @xmath20 umi and v367 sct .",
    "we further exclude eu tau from @xcite because it is a first - overtone cepheid .",
    "note that ls pup is not classified as `` dcep '' in the gcvs .",
    "we also exclude this cepheid though it is included in the t03 sample . for cepheids in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we did not include the cepheids that are classified as `` dceps '' in the gcvs , which includes su cas , gh car and y oph .",
    "the additional cepheids included in our sample but not in t03 are labelled in table [ tab1 ] .    in principle",
    "the number of cepheids can be increased if we include the first overtone ( fo ) galactic cepheids in our sample , by using their fundamental mode periods in obtaining the pl relation .",
    "however , we prefer not to include the fo cepheids due to the following reasons : ( a ) we want to avoid the contaminations from other types of cepheids and select only the _ bona fide _ fundamental mode cepheids ; ( b ) we want to be consistent with t03 , who excluded the non - fundamental mode cepheids in their study ; ( c ) the physics involved in fundamental mode and fo cepheids is not the same ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and ( d ) the results of microlensing surveys to the magellanic clouds suggest that the fo cepheids follow their own pl relations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the theoretical studies from @xcite and @xcite also suggest that the fo cepheids follow different pl relations .",
    "nevertheless , we list the fo cepheids ( classified as `` dceps '' in the gcvs ) with recent distance measurements in table [ fo ] for completeness .",
    "note that although bd cas has been updated to `` dceps '' by @xcite , there is no i band data available for this cepheid in the literature .",
    "we therefore exclude bd cas in table [ fo ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,<,^ \" , ]     @xmath21 the errors are random error only .",
    "the systematic error is about @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "@xmath23 the metallicity correction using the lmc pl relation to this galaxy is @xmath24 @xcite . then the metallicity - corrected distance modulus becomes @xmath25",
    "by using the recent independent distance measurements to 50 galactic cepheids , we derive a galactic pl relation in the b , v and i bands .",
    "our analysis differs from that in t03 due to the following aspects : ( a ) we include other recent independent distance measurements ; and ( b ) we took the weighted - mean to the available distances .",
    "the results confirm that the galactic pl relations are steeper than the lmc counterparts @xcite .",
    "however , the steepness of the galactic pl relation is still inconclusive ( either as steep as in t03 or as shallow as in this study ) because of the small number ( @xmath26 ) of cepheids in the sample .",
    "application of the galactic pl relation from equation ( 2 ) & ( 3 ) to determine the distance to ngc 4258 shows that there is still a @xmath2 discrepancy in distance with the water maser measurements .",
    "the galactic pl relation can be improved if there are more independent distance measurements to galactic cepheids in the future , such as the cycle 12 _ hst _ observations of the nearby cepheids with astrometric measurements ( 10 cepheids from program 9879 , with p.i .",
