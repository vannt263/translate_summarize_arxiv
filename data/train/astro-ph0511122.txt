    "an important issue in current - day astronomy is whether the stellar populations in elliptical galaxies are uniformly old or a complex mixture of various populations of different ages .",
    "one of the classical formation scenarios , the monolithic collapse scenario ( eggen , lynden - bell & sandage 1962 ) suggests that all elliptical galaxies consist of uniformly old stars : i.e. , they formed at high redshift ( @xmath22 ) and evolved passively . the fundamental plane ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ; bender , burstein & faber 1993 ) and the mg@xmath3 relation ( bender et al . 1993 ; ziegler & bender 1997 ; colless et al .",
    "1999 ) show indications towards this possibility . on the other hand",
    ", the hierarchical clustering scenario predicts that elliptical galaxies were formed as a result of merging of galaxies accompanied by intensive starbursts ( e.g. toomre & toomre 1972 ; kauffman & charlot 1998 ) .",
    "results based on spectroscopic line strength analysis by several authors ( e.g. gonzlez 1993 ; trager et al .",
    "2000b ) seem to support this scenario , since a significant scatter in ages is found .",
    "recent results from the sloan survey ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ) seem to indicate that large ellipticals are old and small ellipticals are younger .",
    "although measuring accurate ages and metallicities would lead to a breakthrough in our understanding of the formation of elliptical galaxies , this has been considerably difficult due to the age - metallicity degeneracy ( worthey 1994 ; arimoto 1996 ) .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic properties such as colors , absorption line indices , change almost in the same way to differences in age and metallicity of the stellar populations , so that it is difficult to determine unambiguous ages",
    ".    in understanding the formation of elliptical galaxies in clusters , the color - magnitude relation ( cmr ) plays a fundamental role .",
    "the cmr is an important tool , since in clusters it is tight and as a result provides a relation that can be used to tie together ages , metallicities and masses of galaxies .",
    "the scatter in the cmr is known to be small ( @xmath4 0.05 mag in the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( see bower , lucey & ellis 1992a , b ; terlevich et al .",
    "2001 for low redshift galaxies ) , and is also established in clusters at high redshift ( stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1998 ; blakeslee et al .",
    "2003 ) , supporting the monolithic collapse scenario .",
    "the origin of the cmr has been explored extensively . a model based on the monolithic collapse scenario with",
    "a galactic wind has been able to explain the cmr as a sequence of metallicity ( arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; kodama & arimoto 1997 ) .",
    "this is not the only way to explain the cmr : models based on hierarchical clustering ( kauffmann & charlot 1998 ; ferreras , charlot & silk 1999 ; terlevich et al .",
    "1999 ; ferreras & silk 2000 ) producing a combination of age and metallicity variations could also explain the cmr .",
    "this controversial situation is almost due to the age - metallicity degeneracy . in short , the origin of the cmr is still under debate .",
    "spectroscopic properties , such as absorption line strengths , can partially break the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "worthey ( 1994 ) showed that the h@xmath7 index , defined in burstein et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , is sensitive to the luminosity - weighted age of galaxies and less to their metallicity .",
    "if a galaxy contains ionized gas , however , its emission makes the h@xmath7 absorption line weaker , and therefore an uncertain correction is necessary . to partially get around this one",
    "can use h@xmath8 and h@xmath9 indices , such as h@xmath10 , h@xmath11 , h@xmath12 and h@xmath13 ( defined in jones & worthey 1995 and worthey & ottaviani 1997 ) , which are less affected by emission than h@xmath7 .",
    "these aforementioned indices are some of the lick / ids indices ( burstein et al .",
    "1984 , worthey et al . 1994 ) , which are measuring line strengths of several absorption lines at low resolution .",
    "although maybe less than colors , these indices are still affected by the age - metallicity degeneracy .    partially to overcome the problem of low resolution rose ( 1984 ) investigated spectra of elliptical galaxies using higher resolution indices ( @xmath42  ) . his indices , such as h@xmath9/fe",
    "i and h@xmath8/4325 , are defined as ratios of neighboring absorption lines .",
    "jones & worthey ( 1995 ) defined a new h@xmath14 index , h@xmath15 that would be more sensitive to age . that index , however , is strongly affected by velocity dispersion ( @xmath16 ) broadening of galaxy spectra , since the bandpasses of feature and pseudocontinua are very narrow , and therefore age determination using this index are difficult and has uncertainty .",
    "later , vazdekis & arimoto ( 1999 ) introduced a new age indicator , h@xmath1 , which is very successful at breaking the age - metallicity degeneracy and usable for a wide range of @xmath16 . while the presence of non - solar abundance ratio in most early - type galaxies ( e.g. , gonzlez 1993 ; kuntschner 2000 ; poggianti et al .",
    "2001 , etc . ) introduces systematic errors in the derived ages if lick indices are used , errors from h@xmath1 are less affected by non - solar abundance ; i.e. errors mainly come from poissonian noise .",
    "vazdekis et al .",
    "( 2001a ) applied h@xmath1 to 6 elliptical galaxies in the virgo cluster and demonstrated that it is a useful age - determinator for elliptical galaxies .",
    "the derived ages are uniformly old ( @xmath1710gyr ) , except for one galaxy ( ngc  4478 ) which has bluer color , and the total metallicities and [ mg / fe ] ratios are increasing with luminosity , color and velocity dispersion .",
    "they concluded that the cmr is driven mainly by the mean stellar metallicity .",
    "although this is an important result , it needs to be strengthened , since the number of galaxies in vazdekis et al .",
    "( 2001a ) is small , and the luminosity spans only 3.3 magnitudes .    in this paper",
    "we present new data of 8 elliptical galaxies in the virgo cluster observed with the subaru telescope together with the 6 galaxies of vazdekis et al .",
    "( 2001a ) . for the combined sample of 14 galaxies we present the analysis of the line strengths and determine their ages in various ways .",
    "we describe the details of our sample selection and observations in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we describe the line index measurements and stellar population analysis based on the simple stellar population ( ssp ) models of vazdekis ( 1999 ) . in section 4 ,",
    "we present the measurement of ages and metallicities of our sample , and discuss the advantage of using h@xmath1 index and compare our results with previous studies . in section 5",
    "the conclusions are given . in a future paper ( yamada et al .",
    "2006 ) we discuss age and metallicity trends along the cmr and other scaling relations .",
    "in this paper we present data taken with the subaru and the william herschel telescope .",
    "vazdekis et al .",
    "( 2001a ) presented the first results of the wht long slit observations .",
    "we re - reduced the wht data to check the dependence of data reduction technique on the index measurements and added 8 new galaxies observed with the subaru telescope .",
    "the subaru observations were done on april 17 - 18 , 2002 and june 26 , 2003 .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were performed with the long slit mode of the focas spectrograph with the mit ccd and the r300 grism in the 2nd order ( kashikawa et al .",

    "we made use of tungsten flat fields obtained at each galaxy pointing and twilight flat fields as well as cuarne arc lamp frames for @xmath24 calibration for each exposure . for correction to a relative flux scale the spectrophotometric standard star g191b29 was used .",
    "data reduction was done with the standard iraf packages in the standard way ; i.e. overscan correction , bias subtraction , flat fielding , @xmath24 calibration , sky subtraction and flux calibration .",
    "we used dome flat fields ( for the subaru data ) and tungsten lamp flat fields ( for the wht data ) for correction for pixel - to - pixel variations of the sensitivity .",
    "the spectra of wht have wiggles coming from problems with the dichroic .",
    "we successfully removed these patterns by using tungsten lamp flat fields obtained for each galaxy pointing .",
    "we achieved @xmath25 ( error in @xmath24 ) smaller than 0.07  for the @xmath24 calibration , which is very important for the determination of h@xmath1 , since even a small shift in @xmath24 can affect the h@xmath1 measurement significantly ( vazdekis & arimoto 1999 ) .",

    "abundance ratios contain important information about the formation of galaxies , and are understood to indicate different time - scales for various types of supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath42 elements by sne ii explosions occurs without delay from the onset of star formation because their progenitors are massive stars . on the other hand , sne ia ,",
    "whose progenitors are white dwarfs of binaries , mainly supply iron peak elements 11.5 gyrs after the onset of star formation . as a result , lower [ mg / fe ] indicates that the contribution of sne ia is larger ; i.e. star formation is relatively longer ( worthey 1998 ) or the number fraction of sne ia progenitors is enhanced .",

    "models only have solar abundance ratios , past studies ( trager et al . 2000b",
    "; proctor & sansom 2002 ) used the response functions on the lick / ids system of tripicco & bell ( 1995 ) to derive abundance ratio of each element . since the method using their response functions is complex and introduces unknown systematic errors , we did not use it .",
    "we therefore adopted a more straightforward method using the h@xmath1metal index diagrams , i.e. , we directly estimated [ z@xmath43/h ] , [ z@xmath44/h ] , [ z@xmath45/h ] , [ z@xmath46/h ] and [ z@xmath47/h ] from the h@xmath1 vs. fe3 , mg@xmath39 , ca4227 , cn@xmath40 and g4300 diagram with the ssp model grids , respectively . for galaxies outside the model grid , we slightly extrapolated the grid to measure their metallicities .",
