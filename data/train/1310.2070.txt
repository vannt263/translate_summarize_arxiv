    "a toroid is one of the simplest multiply - connected 3d shapes , and the periodic boundary conditions both simplify and enrich experimental and theoretical work . in the limit of small cross - sectional area , annular traps permit approximate access to ideal 1d infinite systems ( cf .  born - von karman boundary conditions ) using a finite experimental footprint .",
    "ring traps are excellent systems in which to perform atom interferometry @xcite or study superfluidity @xcite .",
    "extremely smooth magnetic ring traps for ultracold atoms can be made via induction @xcite , which eliminates both wire end - effects and roughness from meandering dc currents @xcite .",
    "such time - averaged traps are limited to radii @xmath0 mm for the ` thin - wire ' geometries considered here , however careful optimisation of wire thickness can decrease radii to @xmath1 mm @xcite .",
    "in this paper we show  for the first time  how inductive ring traps can be obtained using rf - dressing , which then permits access to the @xmath2 mm ring radius regime , suitable for fabrication on atom chips .",
    "such chips offer the prospect of portable ultracold atomic setups and there have been recent important developments in both chip loading @xcite and their application @xcite .",
    "we envisage prospects for low - decoherence on - chip studies of sagnac interferometry , superfluidity , ring dark solitons @xcite as well as vortices @xcite and solitons @xcite in low - dimensional systems .",
    "there have been a wide variety of studies of cold matter in toroidal geometries , which we briefly summarize , considering first complementary traps , before concentrating on the purely magnetic techniques relevant to this article .",
    "the optical dipole force can be used in many ways to confine atom in ring traps : by optically plugging a magnetic trap @xcite , using static ` hollow ' laguerre - gauss beams @xcite or beams that have intensity profiles spatially - shaped by a spatial light modulator @xcite .",
    "in addition , one can quickly scan a focused beam @xcite and trap atoms in the time - averaged dipole potential , opening access to a variety of complex geometries including ring lattices .",
    "static dipole traps using both co- @xcite and counter - propagating @xcite laguerre gauss mode superpositions also offer the flexibility of extending to more exotic ring geometries .",
    "magnetic ring - shaped traps have been proposed and realised using either static @xcite or time - averaged @xcite magnetic fields . in purely magnetic traps , to reduce the size of the system , the current - carrying wires  needed to connect the system to an external electric source  get closer to the trap region , perturbing the rotational symmetry of the potential .",
    "furthermore , fragmentation of atomic clouds has been seen for magnetically trapped gases lying close to current carrying wires in atom chips @xcite .",
    "this was attributed to corrugations or irregular domain structure in the conductor that deflect the current from the desired path . a way to circumvent",
    "this is the use of alternating current to ` time - average ' away the defects @xcite .",
    "the need to obtain an ultra - smooth ring trap , with no end effects due to input / output wires and the inherent magnetic smoothness of an ac current , led to the proposal of a time - averaged toroidal trap based on a conducting ring driven by magnetic induction @xcite .",
    "this trap has now been experimentally realised @xcite , however although the trap works well at ring radii of a few mm , it is not scalable down into the sub - mm regime required for atom chips .",
    "this is because time - orbiting potential ( top ) traps @xcite require @xmath3 where the subscripts t , top and l refer to the harmonic trap , rotating bias field , and larmor angular frequencies at the trap location , respectively .",
    "ring - shaped conductors with radius @xmath4 and wire radius @xmath5 have a natural high angular frequency cutoff @xmath6 , however we have shown that inductive top traps work best with @xmath7 a few times greater than @xmath8 @xcite . for a given wire geometry @xmath9 this leads to a prohibitive increase in @xmath7 ( above the larmor angular frequency ) due to the rapid increase in @xmath8 as the ring size shrinks . throughout this paper",
    "we consider @xmath10 , suitable for chip traps , however @xmath8 can be reduced to some extent by increasing @xmath5 for a given @xmath11    recently , using radio - frequency adiabatic potentials @xcite , new ways to create toroidal ring traps have been suggested @xcite offering extended flexibility for trap geometries . in particular",
    "a time - averaged adiabatic potential ( taap ) @xcite ring trap has recently been experimentally demonstrated @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present a new scheme for creating a toroidal trap with a radius in the 100  @xmath12 m range with magnetic fields oscillating at rf frequencies , extending the inductive trap from the top regime @xcite , into the higher - frequency adiabatic regime , whilst retaining all the benefits of the inductive geometry .",
    "magnetic traps are inherently free of the wavelength - scale diffraction corrugation that can potentially plague optical traps with radii @xmath13 m @xcite , and as our trap design is suitable for implementation on atom chips , it will have advantages over dressed traps with macroscopic coils @xcite in terms of gradiometry and portability .",
    "we first present the central principles of the dressed inductive ring trap , then discuss two different implementable layouts , i.e.  with the quantisation magnetic field being either spatially uniform but with time - varying direction ( a taap - type trap ) or a static quadrupole configuration . to begin generally , we consider an atom in a static or slowly varying quantisation magnetic field @xmath14 with an alternating magnetic field @xmath15 at angular frequency @xmath16 . in the dressed state picture , the ac field induces a coupling of the atomic zeeman sub - levels and the resulting interaction hamiltonian can be written @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively the projections of the total angular momentum operator along the @xmath20 polarisation and @xmath21 directions ( if we choose a local co - ordinate system with @xmath21 parallel to @xmath22 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is the sign of the land g - factor @xmath24 for the total angular momentum @xmath25 .",
    "the larmor frequency is expressed as @xmath26 and @xmath27 denotes the rabi frequency associated with the part of the ac field that contributes to the coupling between the zeeman sub - levels , where @xmath28 is the bohr magneton . in this limit",
    ", one can simply express the resulting adiabatic potential as @xmath29 for an atom initially in the @xmath30 zeeman sub - level , with @xmath31 the detuning between the larmor and drive frequencies .",
    "these expressions for @xmath32 and @xmath33 stand in the adiabatic regime , i.e.  as long as the condition @xmath34 is valid , where @xmath35 .",
    "adiabaticity can thus be re - expressed as @xmath36 where @xmath37 represents the total time derivative @xmath38 allowing for atomic motion at velocity @xmath39 and we refer to @xmath40 as the adiabaticity parameter .",
    "we will only consider trapping regions in which the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) is valid , i.e.  @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite .     and",
    "have axes aligned with the @xmath43 direction .",
    "the two geometries we consider are : a ) two helmholtz coil pairs ( blue and dark blue ) driven in quadrature at an angular frequency @xmath44 , b ) a dc anti - helmholtz coil pair ( blue ) .",
    "black , gray and white arrows indicate current directions at angular frequencies @xmath45 @xmath46 and dc , respectively .",
    "co - ordinate pairs are coil current angular frequencies , with associated phases . ]    consider now the experimental apparatus illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gringschem ] : a set of two helmholtz coils ( orange ) provide a spatially homogenous oscillating field @xmath47 throughout the surface of the conductive ring ( red ) , and parallel to the ring axis @xmath48 .",
    "spatial homogeneity of @xmath49 is reasonable if we consider the ring to have much smaller dimensions than the coils , and homogeneity is not essential as long as cylindrical symmetry is not significantly broken .",
    "the magnetic flux from @xmath49 induces a current in the ring , which has a complex amplitude calculated using lenz s law and characterised using the ring s electrical resistance @xmath50 and inductance @xmath51 @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath4 is the radius of the ring .",
    "the above formalism using complex currents allows one to drop time dependence .",
    "this current , in turn , generates a synchronous magnetic field @xmath53 which is fully spatially expressed using elliptical integrals @xcite .",
    "the complete rf field , with time dependence , at position @xmath54 is thus : @xmath55 now we consider a static , or slowly varying , magnetic field @xmath56 , which we choose as our quantisation axis .",
    "the rf field has to be expressed in terms of the two components @xmath57 and @xmath58(*r * ) orthogonal to the static field , since the parallel @xmath59 component does not contribute to coupling .",
    "using jones formalism @xcite , the amplitude of the rf fields that couples to @xmath60 transitions is then given by : @xmath61 it is then straightforward to calculate the adiabatic potential using eq .",
    "[ eq : adiabpot ] .    throughout this paper ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , we assume a copper ring with a radius of @xmath62 m and a wire radius of @xmath63 m .",
    "helmholtz coils provide an rf field of amplitude @xmath64 g oscillating at @xmath65mhz .",
    "our simulations include a finite - element solver @xcite to account for the finite ring size and the skin effect that can significantly change the electrical parameters at high frequencies , as well as for precise calculation of the potential depth . note , however , that the main results of the paper can still be reproduced to reasonable ( @xmath66 ) accuracy without resorting to finite - element calculations . with the above ring dimensions and driving field , the ring has resistance and inductance of @xmath67m@xmath68 and @xmath69nh , respectively .",
    "the current amplitude flowing inside the conductor is @xmath70ma , dissipating about @xmath71mw that rapidly leads to an equilibrium temperature of the copper of approximatively 230@xmath72c ( assuming perfect black body radiation ) .",
    "if required , this temperature rise could be radically reduced using e.g.  a diamond substrate as an electrically insulating heatsink .",
    "we also consider the specific case of @xmath73rb pumped into the @xmath74 magnetic sub - level , therefore @xmath75 and only the @xmath76 component couples to the atomic spin .",
    "we now focus on the inductive taap configuration ( fig .  [",
    "fig : gringschem ]  a ) , where the quantisation field is spatially homogenous , with a vector direction in the @xmath77 plane of the ring , but rotating around the symmetry axis . for a snapshot in time the cylindrical symmetry of the system",
    "is broken by the quantisation field @xmath22  as the total rf field @xmath78 is projected into a different ratio of coupling : non - coupling components , depending on the quantisation direction . however , as the atoms ca nt respond on these time - scales , they experience the cylindrically symmetric time - averaged taap potential averaged over one rotation period of the quantisation field shown in fig .

    "there are two factors to consider for the maximum trappable temperature in the inductive taap .",
    "firstly , gravity results in a saddle point shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gqsschem ] , and atoms hotter than @xmath89k will no longer be confined to a ring but have access to a disk .",
    "secondly , one can show that , during the rotation of the quantisation field , there are curves of points where the rf coupling totally vanishes ( black zones ) .",
    "however , as the detuning is non - zero when the coupling vanishes , the adiabatic potential still exists .",
    "one can estimate the loss at these locations using the @xmath40 parameter , eq .",
    "these points would in principle limit the trap depth to 5  @xmath12k , however the smallest value of the loss parameter is @xmath90 near the instantaneous 3d point of zero - coupling ( compared to @xmath91 at the trap minimum ) for @xmath92k atoms with a quantisation axis rotation rate of @xmath93khz .",
    "we can therefore expect negligible landau - zener loss , so atom temperature and the background pressure will be the only limits to the ring geometry and lifetime , respectively .",

    "@xcite where @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) .",
    "the trap parameters of the inductive taap are amenable to scaling arguments and we consider a scenario where the ring radius and wire radius both scale together with the parameter @xmath98 ( i.e. @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) .",
    "the natural angular frequency of the ring then transforms as @xmath101 , so if the rf drive angular frequency follows an equal scaling @xmath102 , the skin depth of the rf current in the ring scales with @xmath103 i.e. @xmath98 , and the spatial current distribution in the wire remains the same .",
    "moreover , if the amplitude of the rf field @xmath104 and the detuning @xmath80 are kept constant , the taap trap potential depth and shape remain the same ( if gravitational potential is relatively weak ) , but are scaled to cover a region @xmath98 times the original size  i.e. the radial and axial trap frequencies are @xmath105 times larger .",

    "because of the spatially varying magnetic field amplitude , the detuning @xmath80 is spatially dependent .",
    "the geometry of the potential is determined by the strength of the magnetic quadrupole .",

    "however , with appropriate modifications to the trap parameters , scaling to larger and smaller ring radii is possible .    in terms of loading both kinds of dressed inductive ring trap ( taap and quadrupole ) , the relatively shallow depth due to its small dimensions necessitates pre - evaporation of the atomic cloud , after optical molasses , to tens of microkelvin in a magnetic or spin - polarised optical dipole trap . by applying bias fields to a quadrupole / top / ioffe magnetic trap , or focal point scanning of a single - beam dipole trap with an aom / moving lens ,",

    "we note that a third dressed inductive geometry is possible , using a dc current - carrying wire along the ring axis ( cf .",
    "this also has very favourable trapping parameters , however we have omitted detailed description due to the difficulty of experimentally realising such a geometry on a chip .",
    "in conclusion we have extended inductive ring traps from the time - averaged case to the dressed domain , suitable for investigations of sub - millimetre ring traps .",
    "two geometries were considered  an inductive taap ring trap , and a splittable inductive quadrupole ring trap  both of which are amenable to implementation on atom chips .",
    "inductive taaps have the advantage that they are ideally made with spatially homogeneous inducing and quantisation fields , and as such many rings can be implemented in parallel on the same chip for application in e.g.  gradiometry .",
    "inductive quadrupole traps have quasistatic fields which must be centred on the ring , however multiple quadrupoles for each ring can be implemented on the same chip using u - wires , making parallel implementation of this geometry feasible as well .",
    "the inductive quadrupole trap also enables tunable splitting of the ring into a double ring , permitting measurement of e.g. gravitational acceleration , in addition to the usual use of ring traps as gyroscopes .",
    "as both types of inductive ring trap have no reliance on optical dipole forces , their potential should be extremely smooth , even with large ( mm ) scale diameters , ideal for both interferometry and studies of superfluidity .",
