    "knots and links are a fascinating subject and are researched in connection with several concrete applications both in physics and biology @xcite .",
    "a beautiful review from a theoretical physics point of view about knot theory and polymers can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , chapter 16 . in this paper",
    "we study the statistical mechanics of a system of an arbitrary number of entangled polymer rings .",
    "mathematically , two or more entangled polymers form what is called a link .",
    "single polymer rings form instead knots .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to systems in the configurations of @xmath1plats . roughly speaking ,",
    "@xmath1plats are knots or links obtained by braiding together a set of @xmath2 strings and connecting their ends pairwise @xcite",
    ". a physical realization of @xmath1plats could be that of two rings topologically entangled together and with some of their points attached to two membranes or surfaces",
    ". in nature @xmath1plats occur for example in the dna of living organisms @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is believed that most knots and links formed by dna are in the class of @xmath4plats @xcite .",
    "these biological applications have inspired the research of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which @xmath4plats have been studied with the methods of statistical mechanics and field theory . in particular , in @xcite it has been established an analogy between polymeric @xmath4plats and anyons , showing in this way the tight relations between two component systems of quasiparticles and the theory of polymer knots and links . after the publication of @xcite , interesting applications of analogous anyon systems to topological quantum computing have been proposed @xcite .",
    "these applications are corroborated by the results of experiments concerning the detection of anyons obeying a nonabelian statistics , see for example @xcite .",
    "while these results have appeared in 2005 and are still under debate @xcite , other systems in which non - abelian anyon statistics could be present have been discussed @xcite .    motivated by these recent advances , we study here the general case of @xmath1plats in which @xmath0 polymer rings are entangled together to form a link",
    ". the topology of the link is distinguished using the gauss linking number .",
    "this is a weak topological invariant , so that many inequivalent topological configurations characterized by some value of the gauss linking number are allowed .",
    "however , since we are restricting ourselves to conformations that , by construction , must remain @xmath1plats , we are implicitly imposing a more stringent topological condition on the system than that imposed merely by the gauss linking number .",
    "for example , both the unlink and the whitehead link have zero gauss linking number , but a @xmath4plat unlink is not allowed to change into a whitehead link , which can not be realized as a @xmath4plat .",
    "viceversa , a @xmath5plat whitehead link will not transform into a @xmath4plat unlink , despite the fact that both topological configurations share the same value of the gauss linking number .    among all knot and link configurations ,",
    "the class of @xmath1plats is very special .",
    "for instance , it is possible to decompose the trajectory of a @xmath1plat into a set of @xmath2 open subtrajectories that can be further interpreted as the trajectories of @xmath2 polymer chains directed along an arbitrary direction . without losing generality , we assume that this direction coincides with the @xmath6axis .",
    "successively , we map into a field theory the system of @xmath1directed polymers resulting from the decomposition of the plat . after the passage to second quantized fields ,",
    "a model describing a gas of quasiparticles is obtained . in this model , the @xmath7",
    "coordinate becomes the `` time '' , while the monomer densities of the @xmath2 directed polymers may be interpreted as quasiparticle densities of a multi - layered anyon gas .",
    "all the nonlocalities and strong nonlinearities of the original theory due to the topological constraints disappear in the field theoretical formulation .",
    "a remarkable feature of polymers in the configuration of a @xmath1plat is that these systems admit self - dual points and their hamiltonian can be minimized by self - dual solutions of the classical equations of motion .",
    "here we show that in the case of a @xmath4plat these solutions may be explicitly constructed after solving a cosh - gordon equation .",
    "the self - dual conformations of a @xmath4plat should be particularly stable and , on the other side , with the present technologies @xcite it is possible to realize polymer @xmath1plats in the laboratory .",
    "thus there is some hope that some effect related to these conformations could be observable .",
    "apart from the existence of self - dual solutions , the field theoretical model developed in this work has also phenomenological consequences that are relevant for the statistical mechanics of polymers .",
    "first of all , it provides an explicit and nonperturbative expression of the interactions among the monomers arising due to the constraints which fix the topological configuration of the @xmath1plat . after an exact summation over the abelian bf - fields , it turns out that the monomers are subjected to forces of topological origin that have a two - body and a three - body components",
    "the two - body interactions can be both attractive and repulsive , depending on the conformation of the system and strongly interphere with the non - topological interactions , which two - body interactions as well .",
    "this results confirms at a nonperturbative level the outcome of a previous calculation performed with the help of the method of the effective potential @xcite , where it was found that the monomers of two polymer rings attract themselves due to the topological constraints counterfeiting the excluded volume interactions typical of polymers in a good solution . in the particular case of a @xmath8plat ,",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that , after a bogomolnyi transformation , it is possible to single out contributions of the two - body forces of topological origin that match exactly , apart from proportionality constants , the excluded volume forces .",
    "what is somewhat unespected is the presence of three - body interactions in a polymer system subjected to topological constraints imposed with the help of the gauss linking number .",
    "this is surprising because the gauss linking number is able to take into account only the topological relations between pairs of trajectories .",
    "for this reason , one could expect that this type of constraints is rather associated with interactions between pairs of monomers belonging to two different chains .",
    "indeed , before the second quantization procedure , the explicit expression of the gauss linking number can be interpreted as a ( nonlocal ) two - body potential related to forces acting on the bonds located on two different polymers .",
    "three - body forces give a vanishing contribution in the case of links with two polymers only , see ref .",
    "however , we show here that there are processes in which three - body forces are relevant if the number of loops involved in the link is equal to three or higher .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . before mapping the partition function of a general @xmath1plat into that of anyons ,",
    "it is necessary to split the trajectories of the @xmath0 polymer rings forming the plat into a set of @xmath2 subtrajectories .",
    "the splitting procedure and the definition of a suitable `` time '' variable that parametrizes the @xmath2 subtrajectories is carefully described in section  [ sectionii ] . in section  [ sectioniii ]",
    "it is shown how it is possible to implement and simplify in the partition function of the @xmath1plat the constraints that fix the possible topological configurations in which the system of polymer rings linked together can be found .",
    "the constraints are imposed using the gauss linking number .",
    "the treatment follows the method already established in ref .",
    "@xcite , but its generalization to the case in which the trajectories are splitted into subtrajectories parametrized by the special `` time '' coordinate instead of the usual arc - lengths is new .",
    "to eliminate the nonlinearities and nonlocalities introduced by the topological constraints , which necessarily have memory since they must remember the global geometry of the ring in space , we use a set of abelian bf - fields . roughly speaking ,",
    "these fields generate electromagnetic type interactions with the monomers and create in this way the necessary `` reaction '' forces that forbid the system to escape the constraints .",
    "the bf - field theory is quantized in the non - covariant coulomb gauge , because this leads to several simplifications and is very convenient in order to establish the analogy with anyon systems .",
    "how the `` covariance '' of the theory is recovered is shown in appendix  [ appendixb ] in the particular case of a @xmath4plat .",
    "this example is very helpful to interprete the meaning of the gauss linking number in the coulomb gauge , which is apparently more related to the winding number of open trajectories than to the gauss linking number . in section  [ sectioniv ] the passage from first quantized polymer trajectories to second quantized fields",
    "is performed .",
    "the case of general interactions between the monomers is considered .",
    "after the second quantization procedure and the introduction of replica complex scalar fields , the densities of monomers of the original polymer rings can be regarded as the densities of a system of multilayered gas of quasiparticles .",
    "the topological bf - fields are eliminated by integrating them out from the partition function . in section  [ sectionvi ] some phenomenological consequences on the statistical mechanics of the @xmath1plat coming from the field theoretical model obtained in section  [ sectioniv ]",
    "are presented . in section  [ sectionvii ]",
    "we limit ourselves to @xmath4plats , switching off the non - topological interactions . in this particular case ,",
    "studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is known that the hamiltonian of the @xmath4plat is minimized by self - dual solutions . here",
    "the classical equations of motion are reduced to a cosh - gordon equation .",
    "it is shown how the explicit expression of the classical configurations minimizing the hamiltonian of the @xmath4plat can be constructed out of the solution of this cosh - gordon equation .",
    "finally , our conclusions are drawn in section  [ sectionviii ] .",
    "let s consider @xmath0 closed loops @xmath9 of lengths @xmath10 respectively in a three - dimensional space with coordinates @xmath11 .",
    "the vector @xmath12 spans the two dimensional space @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath7 will play later on the role of time .",
    "the @xmath0 loops will be labeled using as indices the first letters of the latin alphabet : @xmath14 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath9 form a @xmath1plat .",
    "for convenience , we briefly review what is a @xmath1plat .",
    "first of all , we recall that a closed trajectory in the three - dimensional space is from the mathematical point of view a knot , while a system of knots linked together forms a link .",

    "giving an orientation to the trajectories , we can distinguish positive and negative crossings , see fig .",
    "[ pncrossings ] .",
    "+    one may also realize that the trefoil diagram in fig .",
    "[ treefoil ] is characterized by two minima and two maxima .",
    "two dimensional diagrams of this kind , deformed in such a way that the number @xmath2 of minima and maxima is the smallest possible and the maxima and minima are aligned at the same heights @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively , are called in knot theory @xmath1plats  .",
    "the height of a @xmath1plat is measured here with respect to the @xmath7 axis . in the present case , with some abuse of language , we will call @xmath1plats any system of @xmath0 three - dimensional knots realized in such a way that the trajectories of the knots are characterized by a number @xmath2 of maxima and minima . the locations of the @xmath18 points of maxima and those of the @xmath18 points of minima",
    "are fixed , i. e. they are not allowed to fluctuate and their number @xmath2 is constant .",
    "the points of maxima and minima do not need to be aligned as it happens in the mathematical definition of a @xmath1plat .",
    "an example of the two - dimensional diagram of such a physical @xmath1plat is given in fig .",
    "[ basiclink ] .",
    "let us denote with the symbols @xmath19 , @xmath20 , the heights of the maxima and minima of each trajectory @xmath21 , for @xmath22 .",
    "of course , it should be that : @xmath23 we choose @xmath24 to be the height of the absolute minimum of each trajectory @xmath21 .",
    "starting from @xmath24 , we select the orientation of @xmath21 in such a way that , proceeding along the trajectory according to that orientation , we will encounter in the order the points @xmath25 .",
    "clearly , @xmath26 is the height of a point of maximum , @xmath27 the height of a minimum and so on .",
    "moreover , we should put for consistency : @xmath28 the introduction of two symbols for the same height @xmath24 will be useful in the future in order to write formulas in a more compact form . in the following",
    ", the trajectories @xmath9 will be decomposed into a set of directed trajectories @xmath29 , @xmath22 and @xmath30 , whose ends are made to coincide in such a way that they form the topological configuration of two linked rings .",

    "these conditions are needed in order to connect together the subtrajectories @xmath29 so that the loop @xmath21 is reconstructed . in eq .",
    "( [ bcondone ] ) the two - dimensional vector @xmath35 represents the projection of the trajectory @xmath29 onto the plane @xmath36 perpendicular to the @xmath6axis .",
    "let us note that we are using the same indexes @xmath37 to label the trajectories @xmath29 and the points @xmath38 .",
    "however , in the first case @xmath39 , while in the second case we have chosen @xmath40 .",
    "the range of the indices @xmath37 in the variables @xmath41 s and of the @xmath42 s that will be defined later is the same as that of the indices labeling the trajectories @xmath29 s , i.  e. @xmath39 .",
    "we notice that the @xmath41 s are always growing . in this way",
    ", the fact that the whole chain is continuous and has a given orientation is not taken into account .",
    "better variables , respecting both the continuity and orientation of the trajectories @xmath29 , are the @xmath42 s , which are defined as follows : @xmath43 assuming for instance that @xmath37 is odd , then for any two consecutive trajectories @xmath29 and @xmath44 the range of the variables @xmath42 and @xmath45 is given by : @xmath46 instead , if @xmath37 is even : @xmath47 let us recall that by our conventions the trajectories labeled by odd @xmath37 s are oriented from a point of minimum to a point of maximum , while trajectories with even values of @xmath37 go from a point of maximum to a point of minimum . accordingly , the new variables @xmath42 have been chosen in such a way that they increase from the minimum to the maximum when @xmath37 is odd , while they decrease from the point of maximum to that of minimum when @xmath37 is even .",
    "finally , we provide the definition of the curves @xmath29 parametrized with the help of the @xmath42 s : @xmath48 of course , the boundary conditions ( [ bcondtwoa ] ) and ( [ bcondtwo ] ) are always understood .",

    "@xmath53 is an abelian gauge field on @xmath54 .",
    "it is easy to show that , after splitting the loop @xmath21 into the subtrajectories @xmath29 , on each of these subtrajectories it is possible to change the arc - length @xmath51 with the parameters @xmath42 . if one does that , the curvilinear integral @xmath55 of eq .",

    "these winding numbers can not change due to the thermal fluctuations , because the end points @xmath63 and @xmath64 of each subtrajectory @xmath29 must be fixed in our construction .",
    "this fact can be used to constrain the @xmath1plat to stay in very complex topological configurations . in the following ,",

    "the topological configurations of the system will rather be imposed as in refs .",
    "@xcite by applying the gauss linking number .",
    "the gauss linking number is a link invariant expressing the topological states of two closed trajectories linked together . due to the fact that it can only be applied to pairs of loops , here",
    "we restrict ourselves for simplicity to the case of a @xmath1plat composed by only two loops @xmath65 and @xmath15 .",
    "note that each of these two loops is a plat too having @xmath66 points of maxima and @xmath66 points of minima with @xmath67 . for consistency",
    ", it should be that @xmath68 .",
    "the gaussian linking number is defined as follows : @xmath69 where the @xmath70 s and the arc - lengths @xmath51 s , @xmath67 have been already defined at the end of the previous section , after eq .",
    "( [ integrali ] ) .",
    "the trajectories of the two loops will be topologically constrained by the condition : @xmath71 @xmath72 being a given integer .",
    "the above constraint is imposed by inserting the dirac delta function @xmath73 in the partition function of the @xmath1plat , where the statistical sum over all conformations of @xmath65 and @xmath15 is performed . of course , the analytical treatment of such a delta function in a path integral is difficult .",
    "some simplification is obtained by passing to the fourier representation : @xmath74 even in the fourier representation , the difficulty of having to deal with the gauss linking number in the exponent appearing in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ deltaft ] ) remains .",
    "formally , this link invariant introduces a term that resembles the potential of a two - body interaction which is both nonlocal and nonpolynomial . for this reason",
    ", the treatment of the gauss linking number in any microscopical model of topologically entangled polymers is complicated .",
    "the best strategy to deal with this problem consists in rewriting the delta function @xmath73 as a correlation function of the holonomies of a local field theory , namely the so - called abelian bf - model @xcite : @xmath75 where @xmath76}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&e^{-i\\tilde c_{12}\\oint_{\\gamma_1}d\\tilde x^\\mu_1(d_1 )    b_\\mu^{12}(\\tilde{x}_1(d_1 ) ) } e^ { -i\\tilde d \\oint_{\\gamma_2 } d\\tilde x^\\mu_2 ( d_2)c_\\mu^{12}(\\tilde{x}_2(d_2 ) ) } \\label{c2a3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equation we have put @xmath77 to be dummy integration variables spanning the whole three - dimensional space @xmath78 .",

    "( [ c2a3 ] ) by performing a rescaling of one of the two fields @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    "( [ maintopcurrents ] ) the goal of transforming the nonlinear and nonlocal interaction appearing in the right hand side of eq .",

    "in all the above discussion , the two trajectories @xmath65 and @xmath15 have been parametrized with the help of the arc - lengths @xmath95 and @xmath96 . however , in the present case",
    "the loops @xmath9 are realized as a set of open paths @xmath29 connected together by the conditions ( [ bcondtwoa])([bcondtwo ] ) .",
    "the subtrajectories @xmath29 s are directed paths @xmath97 parametrized by the variables @xmath42 .",

    "( [ twobody ] ) , these quartic terms are exactly of the same form of those contained in the action  ( [ smatter2 ] ) .",
    "here we have seen in the more general case of a @xmath1plat and an arbitrary two - body potential @xmath327 how the interactions arising due to the presence of the constraints interphere with the non - topological interactions of eq .",
    "( [ sev ] ) .",
    "for example , from eq .",
    "( [ spart ] ) it is possible to realize that in the action @xmath198 the third components of the bf - fields can be absorbed by the fields @xmath156 after a shift . since the bf - fields are related to the topological constraints and the fields @xmath156 are propagating the non - topological forces , this hints to a strong interplay between the topological and non - topological interactions .",
    "let us note that the effect of the forces of topological origin may result both in a reciprocal attraction or repulsion between the monomers , while the short range two - body potential ( [ twobody ] ) , corresponding to the case in which the polymers are immersed in a solution , can only be attractive if @xmath328 or repulsive if @xmath329 .",
    "2 .   the field theoretical model of polymeric @xmath1plats defined by eqs .  ( [ reallyfinal])([c4c ] )",
    "shows that three - body forces become relevant in a system of @xmath0 polymers linked together in which the topological constraints are imposed by means of the gauss linking number .",
    "these three - body forces have been represented in the form of a feynman diagram in fig .",
    "[ vertices]-(c ) and are described in section  [ sectionvi ] .",
    "an example of process in which there are interactions between three monomers at once has been shown in fig .  [ three - body - forces - example ] .",
    "the existence of three - body interactions acting on the monomers was not predicted by previous calculations .",
    "this is probably because only the case @xmath246 has been mainly treated so far .",
    "when @xmath246 , it turns out that the contribution of sextic interactions terms in the action of eq .",
    "( [ s1mattercg ] ) , which are responsible for the presence of the three - body forces , vanishes in the zero replica limit . besides , the appearance of three - body forces is not trivial and not easy to be predicted , because the gauss linking number involves only interactions between pairs of monomers .",
    "3 .   by using the splitting procedure presented in section  [ sectionii ] and",
    "thanks to the introduction of auxiliary fields , the problem of the statistical mechanics of a @xmath1plat has been mapped into the dynamics of a system in which quasiparticles of different kinds are mixed together . in ref .  @xcite it has been shown that systems of this type admit vortex solutions . out of the self - duality regime ,",
    "vortex magnetic lines associated with quasi - particles of different kind can repel or attract themselves .",
    "after a particular choice of the parameters of the theory , in which the coefficients @xmath263 , @xmath67 and @xmath249 are all equal , a self - dual point is reached in which attractive and repulsive forces balance themselves and disappear . a similar phenomenon , but in a different model , has been recently found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work ,",
    "the self - dual vortex conformations have been computed exactly and explicitly up to the solution of a cosh - gordon equation .",
    "the topological properties of the link formed by the @xmath1plat have been described here by using the gauss linking invariant , which is related to the abelian bf - model of eq .",
    "( [ csaction ] ) .",
    "we have seen in appendix  [ appendixb ] how the topological constraints are fixed when the bf - model is quantized in the coulomb gauge . in this gauge",
    "are counted the winding numbers of all possible pairs of paths formed by the subtrajectories @xmath29 belonging to a loop @xmath21 and the subtrajectories @xmath62 belonging to another loop @xmath244 .",
    "the sum of all these winding numbers is an integer multiple of @xmath330 , where the integer is equal to the half of the number of left and right crossings of the two oriented trajectories @xmath21 and @xmath244 .",
    "this number is independent on the way in which the trajectories are projected on a plane and provides a well known alternative definition of the gauss linking number . in this way , also in the coulomb gauge the condition that the gauss linking number of @xmath21 and @xmath244 should be equal to some value @xmath245 is realized . while abelian anyon field theories like those of eq .",
    "( [ csaction ] ) may be significant in quantum computing @xcite , it is rather nonabelian statistics that plays the main role in this kind of applications . despite its limitations , when the gauss linking number is applied to a @xmath1plat configuration , which can not be destroyed because the @xmath2 points of maxima and minima are kept fixed , some of the nonabelian features of the system are certainly captured . as a matter of fact , in the case of @xmath1plats the capabilities of the gauss linking number to distinguish the changes of topology are enhanced .",
    "the reason is the synergy between the constraints imposed by the gauss linking number and those imposed by the fact that the polymer system can not escape the set of conformations allowed in a @xmath1plat . indeed , since the end points of the subtrajectories @xmath29 and @xmath62 are fixed , also the winding number between two different subtrajectories is fixed . due to the constraints imposed by the linking number ,",
    "allowed are only those topology changes for which an amount of the winding angle of two subtrajectories is transferred in units of @xmath330 to the winding angle of another pair of subtrajectories . moreover ,",
    "the number of subtrajectories is fixed to be equal to @xmath2 . as a consequence , at least in the particular case of @xmath1plats ,",
    "it is possible to overcome the limitations of the gauss linking number .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , if we start from an unlink consisting of a @xmath4plat , the system will never be able to attain the configuration of a whitehead link and viceversa , a @xmath5plat whitehead link can not turn into a @xmath4plat . moreover , in a forthcoming publication we will show how the present formalism can be applied to include the treatment of links without the limitations of the gauss linking number and even to the case of nontrivial knots .",
    "this will pave the way to the treatment of polymer knots or links constructed from tangles .",
    "polymers of this kind are relevant in biochemistry because nontrivial knot configurations appearing as a major pattern in dna rings are mostly in the form of tangles @xcite .",

    "moreover , we remember that in our notation @xmath372 . apparently , the elements of the trajectories @xmath373 and @xmath374 which lie below @xmath375 and above @xmath376 do not take the part in the topological interactions . thus is due to the presence of the dirac @xmath353-function @xmath377 in the components of the chern - simons propagator ( [ propone])-([proptwo ] ) .",
    "however , we will see later that also the contributions of these missing parts are present in the expression of @xmath378 . in order to proceed , we notice that the exponent of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ reszcs ] ) consists in a sum of integrals over the time @xmath379 of the kind : @xmath380 the above integrals can be computed exactly .",

    "the winding angle between the two trajectories @xmath65 and @xmath15 has changed by the quantity @xmath399 .",
    "3 .   next , in the region @xmath400 , the winding angle which measures how many times the subtrajectory @xmath398 winds up around @xmath401 is given by the difference @xmath402 .",
    "4 .   finally , in the region @xmath403 only the second trajectory @xmath15 continues to evolve , going first downwards with the curve @xmath401 and then upwards with @xmath395 .",
    "the net effect of this evolution is that the winding angle between @xmath65 and @xmath15 changes by the quantity @xmath404 .",
    "it is thus clear that the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ logzcs ] ) , apart from a proportionality factor @xmath405 , counts how many times the trajectory @xmath373 winds around the trajectory @xmath374 . if we wish to identify the quantity in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ logzcs ] ) with the gauss linking number @xmath406 , we should check for consistency that it takes only integer values as the gauss linking number does .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that , modulo @xmath330 , the following identities are holding : @xmath407 for example , the first of the above equalities states that the angle formed by the vector @xmath408 connecting the subtrajectories @xmath394 and @xmath395 at the height @xmath409 is equal to the angle formed by the vector @xmath410 connecting the subtrajectories @xmath394 and @xmath401 at the same height .",
    "the reason of this identity is trivial : at that height , the subtrajectories @xmath395 and @xmath401 are connected together at the same point . applying the above relations to eq .",
    "( [ logzcs ] ) , one may prove that : @xmath411 as a consequence , we can write : @xmath412 where @xmath406 is the gauss linking number .",
    "concluding , the above analysis shows that also in the coulomb gauge the bf fields in the polymer partition function ( [ ppm ] ) fix the topological constraints ( [ topconst ] ) correctly , in full consistency with the results obtained in the covariant gauges .",
    "of course this consistency was expected due to gauge invariance .",

    "<S> the main subject of this work is the statistical mechanics of a system of @xmath0 polymer rings linked together . </S>",
    "<S> the link that arises in this way is constrained to be in the form of a @xmath1plat , where @xmath2 is the fixed number of maxima and minima of the polymer trajectories along one chosen direction . </S>",
    "<S> plats appear very often in nature , in particular in the dna of living organisms . </S>",
    "<S> the topological states of the link are distinguished using the gauss linking number . </S>",
    "<S> this is a relatively weak link invariant in the case of a general link , but its efficiency improves when @xmath1plats are considered as it will be proved here . using field theoretical methods , a nonperturbative expression of the partition function of the system is achieved . in its final form , </S>",
    "<S> this partition function is equivalent to that of a multi - layer electron gas . </S>",
    "<S> such quasi - particle systems are studied in connection with several interesting applications , including high-@xmath3 superconductivity and topological quantum computing . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the topological constraints acting on the polymer rings generate two and three - body forces acting on the monomers . </S>",
    "<S> these forces interphere with the non - topological two - body forces to which monomers are subjected in a solution , enhancing for instance the attraction between the monomers . </S>",
    "<S> what is remarkable is the appearance of three - body forces of topological origin . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that these three - body interactions have nonvanishing contributions when three or more rings are entangled together . </S>"
