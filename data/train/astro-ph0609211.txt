    ", we describe our survey , and announce the discovery of four , well - resolved igc candidates in virgo . in section  3 , we discuss the metallicities of these objects , and show that all are metal poor , with photometric properties that differentiate them from the globular clusters of virgo s central cd galaxy , m87 . in section  4 , we compare the candidate igcs to galactic globular clusters and show that their half - light and tidal radii are larger than their milky way counterparts .",
    "we attribute these properties to the igcs lack of tidal processing , and use the radii to constrain the clusters origins .",
    "we conclude by estimating the specific frequency of globular clusters in virgo s intracluster space , and discussing the implications this number has for the origin of igcs and future igc surveys .",
    "between 30 may 2005 and 7 june 2005 we used the _ advanced camera for surveys _ on the _ hubble space telescope _ to obtain deep f606w and f814w images of a single virgo intracluster field ( @xmath412:28:10.80 , @xmath512:33:20.0 , orientation 112.58 degrees ) , @xmath6  deg ( @xmath7  kpc ) from any large galaxy .",
    "the f814w ( @xmath8-band ) data consisted of 22 exposures totaling 26880  s of integration time ; the f606w ( wide @xmath9-band ) observations included 52 exposures totaling 63440  s. these data were co - added using the multidrizzle task within pyraf @xcite : this procedure removed all the cosmic rays , corrected the instrument s geometric distortions , and improved the sampling of our data to @xmath10  pixel@xmath11 .",
    "the details of these reductions , and an image of the field illustrating its position in the cluster is given by @xcite .",
    "after combining the data , we used seextractor @xcite to identify all sources ( extended and unresolved ) brighter than @xmath12 , near the peak of the globular cluster luminosity function in virgo ( @xmath13 , * ? ? ?",
    "we then cross - correlated this list with the point source identifications from daophot  ii @xcite , and searched for objects surrounded by a statistical excess of stars ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "this procedure yielded eight sources , three of which were obvious background galaxies with internal structure , and one of which was clearly surrounded by misidentified background galaxies .",
    "however the remaining four objects had the properties expected for igcs .",
    "each was well - resolved and roughly spherical ( @xmath15 ) , each had an integrated f814w magnitude near the peak of the virgo globular cluster luminosity function , and each was surrounded by point sources which had the colors and magnitudes of virgo cluster red giant stars .",
    "the coordinates of these four sources , aligned to the astrometry of the automatic plate measuring ( apm ) machine catalog , apmcat/ ] are given in table  [ tab1 ] ; images of the objects are displayed in figure  [ pics ] .",
    "we performed photometry on the point sources surrounding the igc candidates using daophot  ii @xcite .",
    "instrumental magnitudes in @xmath16 apertures were computed via point - spread - function fitting .",
    "these magnitudes were then extrapolated to infinite apertures and placed on the vega magnitude system using the correction parameters and photometric zero points given by @xcite .",
    "photometry of the candidate igcs themselves was performed with the iraf task phot using a series of concentric circular apertures , ranging in size from @xmath17 to @xmath18 . within @xmath19",
    "these aperture radii were incremented in @xmath17 intervals ; outside this radius , aperture widths were increased to maintain a near constant photometric error .",
    "again , these instrumental magnitudes were converted to the vega magnitude system using the zero points of @xcite .",
    "transformations to the standard @xmath20 magnitude system were performed using the coefficients of @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that these transformations have a rather large scatter , @xmath21  mag .",
    "consequently , this last step was only used to compare the integrated magnitudes of our globular cluster candidates with other measurements in the literature . whenever possible , we confined our analysis to the f606w@xmath22f814w magnitude system .",
    "to translate our photometric measurements into physical parameters , we first dereddened the observed magnitudes using the @xcite value for galactic foreground extinction ( @xmath23 ) . with the reddening law of @xcite and the _ acs _ filter transformations of @xcite",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "total luminosities for the igc candidates were then calculated assuming a virgo distance of 16.2  mpc , and a bolometric correction of @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 ) .",
    "finally , these luminosities were used to estimate masses by assuming a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath28 , which is typical for galactic clusters @xcite .    to test whether our candidate igcs are true globular clusters , we convolved a series of @xcite model profiles with a @xcite representation of the f814w filter point - spread - function , and fitted the resultant curve to the objects radial profiles using a @xmath29 minimization procedure .",
    "the best fits are shown in figure  [ king ] , with the photometric errors increased by 5% ( added in quadrature ) to account both for deviations between the true psf and our moffat function , and for the `` red halo effect '' @xcite .",
    "the best - fit core radii , tidal radii , and half - light radii are given in table  [ tab1 ] ; the errors on these numbers are the standard deviations of fits to a series of monte carlo simulations of each brightness profile .",
    "( the data for igc-3 ( our faintest candidate ) was not of sufficient precision to constrain the tidal radius , so no errors are given for this object . ) in all four cases , our convolved king profiles provide good fits to the data , with @xmath30 .",
    "this contrasts with fits which use the @xcite @xmath31-law or an exponential disk ( also given in table  [ tab1 ] ) , which generally give poorer @xmath29 values .",
    "the quality of the fits strongly supports the conclusion that these objects are , indeed , globular clusters .",
    "additional support for the globular cluster interpretation comes from the point sources surrounding each igc candidate .",
    "the mean density of all unresolved sources detected in our intracluster survey field ( down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath32 ) is 480  arcmin@xmath33 @xcite .",
    "thus , we would expect @xmath6 stars to be projected between @xmath34 and @xmath35 from the center of each igc candidate .",
    "even the faintest of our candidates has 6 times this number ; the poisson probability of having four or more stars randomly projected about a @xmath36 object in our field is less than 0.5% .",
    "since there are 195 such objects present in the region , at most one of our igc candidates is expected to be a chance superposition of stars around a bright unrelated object , and a visual examination of the candidates reduces this number , further .",
    "the final piece of evidence supporting of igc identification is the magnitude of the brightest stars surrounding each cluster , @xmath37 .",
    "this is the magnitude expected of red giant stars at the distance of virgo @xcite .",
    "it therefore seems likely that the sources surrounding each igc candidate are red giants bound to the clusters .",
    "can the objects be background galaxies or some other source unrelated to globular clusters ? the radial profile of igc-1",
    "can be fit with both a king model and an @xmath31-law ( @xmath38 ) , so it is conceivable that this object is a field elliptical galaxy . however , igc-1 is also bright enough to have photometry from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , and its sloan @xmath39 and @xmath40 colors ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively ) are bluer than those of any normal elliptical at any redshift @xcite .",
    "this fact , along with the object s @xmath43 and @xmath44 colors , which are bluer than those of local small ellipticals @xcite but similar to those of virgo globulars @xcite , makes it extremely unlikely that the object is a background galaxy .",
    "similarly , although the radial profile of our faintest candidate , igc-3 , _ can _ be fit with an @xmath31-law ( with @xmath45 ) , king models or a @xcite profile with @xmath46 (  an isothermal distribution ) generate an even lower @xmath29 , and the object s @xmath44 color is again much bluer than that expected from a normal elliptical .",
    "finally , igc-2 and igc-3 are our most elongated igc candidates ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) , with shapes that are more eccentric than @xmath47 of galactic globulars @xcite . while , it is possible the more elliptical galactic clusters are tidally disturbed by the galaxy , it is clear that these ellipticities do not rule out a globular cluster classification . in any case ,",
    "king profiles provide much better fits to these candidates than any exponential or @xmath31 law .",
    "in fact , the only objects that could reproduce the observed properties of our igc candidates are the nuclear remains of tidally stripped dwarf galaxies .",
    "such an origin has been proposed for the milky way object @xmath48  cen @xcite , the giant globular cluster g1 in m31 @xcite , the most massive clusters of ngc  5128 @xcite , and the ultra - compact dwarfs of virgo and fornax @xcite .",
    "however , all of our igc candidates are much fainter than these unusual objects : for example , @xmath48  cen is over a magnitude brighter than our most luminous igc candidate , and the ultra - compact dwarf galaxies found by @xcite and @xcite are brighter still .",
    "of course , it is difficult to completely exclude the possibility that our igcs are stripped dwarfs : @xmath48 cen is more than a thousand times closer than virgo , and its classification is still controversial @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , given that all four candidates have luminosities near the peak of the globular cluster luminosity function , the simpliest explanation for these sources is that they are , indeed , normal globular clusters at the distance of virgo .",
    "figure  [ cmds ] plots the point sources within @xmath49  arcsec ( @xmath2100 pc at virgo ) of each globular cluster candidate on the f606w@xmath22f814w color - magnitude diagram .",
    "overplotted are isochrones for an old ( 12.5  gyr ) stellar population @xcite at the distance of virgo .",
    "these sparse cmds suggest that all four of our igc candidates are metal - poor .",
    "the most metal - rich of the group , igc-4 , has [ m / h ] @xmath50 , while the stars of igc-2 and igc-3 fall close to most metal - poor isochrone ( [ m / h ] @xmath51 ) .",
    "curiously , four of the point sources surrounding igc-1 fall blueward of any of the @xcite isochrones , in a region of the hr diagram occupied primarily by background sources @xcite .",
    "it is possible that either there is an overdensity of background objects in this part of the field or that the effects of crowding have produced errors in the stellar photometry larger than the standard errors shown on the cmd . in any case , if we exclude these objects from the analysis , the remaining stars of the cluster imply a metallicity of [ m / h ] @xmath52 .    the metal - poor nature of our globular cluster candidates is supported by their integrated colors , though not to the extent that one might expect . in most large galaxies ,",
    "the distribution of globular cluster colors is bimodal @xcite .",
    "for example , the color distribution of m87 globulars is well - modeled by two gaussians , one with a peak at @xmath53 and the other centered at @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "this division has generally been interpreted as evidence for the existence of two separate populations of clusters , one consisting of blue , `` metal - poor '' objects , and the other comprised of `` metal - rich '' systems ( * ? ? ? * but see @xcite for an alternative explanation ) .",
    "the integrated colors of clusters igc-3 and igc-4 clearly place them in the metal - poor category , as one might expect from the colors of their halo stars .",
    "however , igc-1 and igc-2 both have colors that fall slightly to the red of the dividing line .",
    "this seems incompatible with the colors of the systems red giant stars .    to investigate this inconsistency , we measured the objects radial color profiles . as figure  [ colorprof ] demonstrates , igc-1 and igc-2",
    "both have significant color gradients , with the clusters interiors being redder than their halos by @xmath55  mag .",
    "such gradients are usually associated with galaxies , and , as mentioned above , it is conceivable that these two clusters are actually the stripped remains of compact dwarf galaxies @xcite . but",
    "this need not be the case : in the galaxy , one third of all globular clusters have similar red - to - blue gradients @xcite .",
    "whether these gradients are caused by the effects of mass segregation , the random presence of a few relatively bright stars @xcite , or chemical inhomogeneities in the stellar populations @xcite is unclear .",
    "however , it does explain how our two igc candidates can have neutral colors , but still exhibit metal - poor cmds .",
    "it is therefore possible that these two igcs are of intermediate metallicity .",
    "future spectroscopy can provide a definitive answer to this question .",
    "the fact that all four of our igc candidates are relatively blue stands in marked contrast to the color distribution of clusters in m87 s inner regions .",
    "s globulars have a mean @xmath56 and @xmath57 are classified as `` metal - rich '' based on their red colors .",
    "all of our igc candidates have metal - poor rgbs , and our two reddest clusters just barely fall on the red - side of the color distribution . to a limited extent",
    ", this is consistent with the results of @xcite , who showed that outside of @xmath58  kpc , the ratio of red to blue clusters surrounding brightest cluster galaxies drops dramatically . however , in the @xcite sample , the fraction of red clusters never drops below @xmath59 , even at galactocentric distances of @xmath60  kpc .",
    "the igcs in our intracluster field are @xmath7  kpc from any galaxy , and the probability of observing four clusters with @xmath61 out of the @xcite distribution is just @xmath62 .",
    "these numbers suggests that the igc population in our field is fundamentally different from that associated with brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the four globular cluster candidates observed in our small intracluster field are not representative of the virgo igc population as a whole .",
    "three of the four clusters , igc-1 , 2 , and 3 , are located in a line which runs north - south along the western half of our field .",
    "since these clusters are also the most metal - poor of our candidates , it is possible that all three originated in a single stripped galaxy , and that the stream has not yet completely mixed with the general intracluster population .",
    "indeed , the spatial sub - structure exhibited by the metal - poor stars in our _ acs _ field is evidence for just such a scenario @xcite . if coherent streams are common , then a much wider survey will be needed to reliably measure the properties of virgo s globular clusters .",
    "figure  [ rcrt ] compares the core and tidal radii of our igc-1 , 2 , and 4 with those of galactic globular clusters , using our adopted virgo distance .",
    "( igc-3 is not plotted , since its tidal radius is unconstrainted . ) from the figure , we can see that , though the core radii of the two sets of objects are comparable , the tidal radii of the intergalactic objects are larger than most of their milky way counterparts .",
    "this is not a selection effect : since our igc search criteria included all sources detected by sextractor , our sample is not biased by size . in fact , a close examination of figure  [ rcrt ] shows that the tidal radii of our igc candidates are similar to those of the milky way clusters with large galactocentric distances .",
    "this agrees with the thesis that globular clusters inside large galaxies are continually affected by tidal stress .",
    "such stress is thought to play a key role in the evolution of galaxy - bound clusters .",
    "for example , analyses by @xcite and @xcite suggest that over a hubble time , a large fraction of globular clusters within a milky way - type spiral will be either stripped or destroyed .",
    "however , if our igcs were created _ in situ , _ or if their parent galaxies were low - mass objects , then tides have never been important for their dynamical evolution .",
    "support for this idea also comes from the observations of @xcite , who showed that in the rich abell cluster  1185 , the half - light radii of globular clusters systematically increases with galactocentric distance .",
    "the large tidal radii of the clusters provide a hint about the length of time for which the igcs have been free - floating .",
    "dynamical models predict that globular clusters recover from galactic tidal shocking on a half - mass relaxation timescale , which is typically 510 @xmath63 yr @xcite .",
    "after several of these relaxation times , the clusters will lose any structures caused by past tidal effects and approach a distribution governed by the gradient of the galaxy cluster s potential , a value that is @xmath64 times less .",
    "the fact that the igcs are well - fitted by king profiles with finite tidal radii suggests our objects were once affected by the tidal field of a galaxy @xcite , but are now internally evolving towards a state with little tidal truncation . since this process can take 5 - 10 gyr @xcite , the observations imply that these igcs have been free - floating , unaffected by strong tidal influences , for several gyr .",
    "in order to place these igc candidates into a context of galaxy cluster evolution , it is important to compare our surface density results with previous surveys for these objects .",
    "the existence of four igcs within our 11.4  arcmin@xmath33 field implies that virgo s igc surface density is @xmath65  arcsec@xmath33 .",
    "if we scale this number to the distance of coma ( a distance ratio of 6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then our data imply a surface density that is safely below the upper - limit of 0.004  arcsec@xmath33 measured by @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a scaling of our surface density to the distance of a1185 ( @xmath66 km s@xmath11 ) yields a value that is a factor of two larger than that observed by @xcite .",
    "however , since their survey only reached one magnitude _",
    "brighter _ than the peak of the globular cluster luminosity function , while our observations go @xmath67  mag _ fainter _ than the peak , the two values are compatible .    the number of igcs places an interesting constraint on the specific frequency ( @xmath68 ) of globular clusters in virgo s intracluster environment .",
    "star counts ( after the statistical removal of unresolved background galaxies ) in our @xmath69  arcmin@xmath70 field reveal @xmath71 stars brighter than @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "if we extrapolate these counts down to the main sequence using the isochrones of @xcite , then the data imply an intracluster surface brightness brightness of @xmath73  mag  arcsec@xmath33 ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an absolute total luminosity of @xmath22@xmath74  kpc@xmath33 , and a globular cluster specific frequency @xmath1 .",
    "this relatively high value suggests that we have not missed a significant number of igcs , and that the properties of these four igcs may be representative of the igc population in virgo .",
    "our value of @xmath1 can be used to place a constraint on the origins of the virgo intracluster population . if most of the stars in virgo s intergalactic space originated in typical spirals ( were liberated via the galaxy harassment scenario of",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then we would expect to measure a much lower value for the globular cluster specific frequency , with @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "this argument may apply to low surface brightness spirals as well ( j.h .",
    "kim et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "alternatively , if intracluster stars are the disrupted remains of low - luminosity dwarfs , then @xmath68 should be @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "our value for the specific frequency of globular clusters lies between these two extremes , in the range normally associated with cd galaxies @xcite and dwarf ellipticals @xcite",
    ". in fact , dwarf elliptical galaxies are the most common morphological type in galaxy clusters @xcite , and the virgo core currently contains about 900 of these objects .",
    "this is a significant number of galaxies : @xcite estimate that if two - thirds of all dwarf ellipticals are destroyed through gravitational interactions over a hubble time , then their remnants could account for virgo s entire intracluster population .",
    "the preceding has two caveats .",
    "first , the low metallicities and high specific frequency of igcs could be due to preferential stripping of globular clusters during tidal encounters .",
    "the radial distribution of clusters within a galaxy is often flatter than that of the galaxy s light @xcite ; this fact is consistent with the idea that such systems are often formed during galactic mergers and interactions @xcite .",
    "since clusters ( and stars ) in the outskirts of galaxies are more susceptible to tidal forces than interior objects , this mismatch can lead to the increased stripping of globular clusters with respect to the stars .",
    "the result is that in rich clusters , where tidal encounters are important , the specific frequency of clusters in intergalactic space can be enhanced at the expense of galactic values .",
    "there is some evidence for just this effect : in virgo , some galaxies have lower values of @xmath68 than their field counterparts ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , since systems of blue globular clusters often have flatter radial distributions than those of red clusters @xcite , this process can explain why the four igc candidates found in our survey are all metal - poor .    a second caveat to our measurement of @xmath68 concerns the survival of clusters in the galactic and extragalactic environments . in large galaxies , bulge shocks , disk shocks , and dynamical friction all",
    "take their toll on the globular cluster population , so that , over a hubble time , a large fraction of clusters will be destroyed @xcite .",
    "such processes do not occur in intergalactic space .",
    "consequently , while values of @xmath68 in a passively evolving galaxy can decline with time , the specific frequency of igcs can actually increase ( this is because the igcs are not destroyed and the luminosity of the normalizing intracluster stellar population decreases as it ages ) .",
    "the importance of this effect is difficult to model , since it depends critically on where and when the igcs originally formed .",
    "however , like the effects of preferentially stripping , this mechanism will produce higher values of @xmath68 for the intracluster environment than for the clusters parent galaxies .",
    "the metallicities of our igc candidates alone do not help determine the clusters origins , as most globular cluster systems contain a significant blue ( metal - poor ) component .",
    "however , the relatively blue colors and metal - poor cmds of our candidates do support the hypothesis of @xcite that redder , more metal - rich clusters must form later in the deeper potential wells of major galaxies . the fact that none of our igcs are metal - rich implies that , once formed , it is difficult to eject red clusters into intergalactic space .",
    "in order to properly investigate the systematics of igcs , one needs a much larger sample of objects . the key to obtaining such a sample is spatial resolution : with ground - based images , it is extremely difficult to distinguish igcs from the ( much more numerous ) background contaminants .",
    "however , the fact that four igcs were discovered in a single _ acs _ field suggests that with a few additional _ hst _ pointings , one can identify an astrophysically interesting sample of such objects . with _",
    "hst _ resolution , one can obtain the igcs structural parameters , measure their tidal radii , and investigate the systematics of a set of clusters that have evolved in a largely stress - free environment .",
    "moreover , with follow - up ground - based spectroscopy one can measure conclusive ages and metallicities .",
    "such a sample can be a powerful probe of galactic and cluster evolution . by comparing the luminosities of globular clusters in and outside of galaxies , one can test for the effects that bulge and disk shocking have on the globular cluster luminosity function . similarly , by examining the distribution of tidal radii for igcs , one can probe the length of time these objects have been in the intergalactic environment , and complement population constraints imposed by the intracluster stars . finally , with a large sample of clusters",
    ", we can test whether the bimodal color and metallicity distributions often seen around large galaxies extend to the intracluster population , and whether `` red '' clusters can be liberated from their parent galaxies .",
    "such tests , in turn , can place new constraints on the formation of these objects .",
