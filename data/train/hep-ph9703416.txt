    "the polarization of gluons in @xmath0 annihilation  @xcite , in deep inelastic scattering  @xcite and in quarkonium decays  @xcite has been studied in a series of papers dating back to the early 80 s .",
    "several proposals have been put forward to measure the polarization of the gluon among which is the proposal to measure angular correlation effects in the splitting process of a polarized gluon into a pair of gluons or quarks  @xcite .",
    "latter proposal has led to a beautiful confirmation of the presence of the three - gluon vertex in the @xmath0 data  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the earlier calculations of the gluon s polarization in @xmath0 annihilations had been done for massless fermions which was quite sufficient for the purposes of that period  @xcite . in the meantime",
    "the situation has changed in so far as the heavy top quark has been discovered whose production properties in @xmath0 annihilations will be studied in the proposed next - linear - collider ( nlc ) .",
    "typical running energies of the nlc would extend from @xmath1-threshold at about @xmath2 to maximal energies of about @xmath3 .",
    "it is quite clear that top mass effects can not be neglected in this energy range even at the highest c.m",
    ".  energies .",
    "it is therefore timely to redo the calculations of  @xcite for heavy quarks and to investigate the influence of heavy quark mass effects on the polarization observables of the gluon .",
    "as is usual we shall represent the two - by - two differential density matrix @xmath4 of the gluon with gluon helicities @xmath5 in terms of its components along the unit matrix and the three pauli matrices .",
    "accordingly one has @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the unpolarized differential rate and @xmath8 are the three components of the ( unnormalized ) differential stokes vector .",
    "specifying to @xmath9 we perform an azimuthal and polar averaging over the relative beam - event orientation .",
    "after azimuthal averaging the @xmath10-component of the stokes vektor @xmath11 drops out  @xcite .",
    "one retains only the @xmath12- and @xmath13-components of the stokes vector which are referred to as the gluon s linear polarization in the event plane and the circular polarization of the gluon , respectively . in this report",
    "we study the differential energy distribution of the polarization of the gluon , differential with regard to the scaled gluon energy @xmath14 . after having integrated over the quark ( or antiquark ) energy the circular polarization of the gluon averages to zero due to @xmath15-invariance .",
    "the differential unpolarized and polarized rates ( with @xmath16 ) are then given by @xmath17 the notation @xmath18 stands for either @xmath7 or @xmath19 , and the same for @xmath20 ( the index @xmath21 is explained later on ) .",
    "this notation closely follows the one in  @xcite where the nomenclature @xmath22 has been used to denote the total rate ( @xmath23 : unpolarized transverse , @xmath24 : longitudinal ) .",
    "the electro - weak cross section is written in modular form in terms of two building blocks .",
    "the first building block specifies the electro - weak model dependence through the parameters @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "they are given by @xmath27 where , in the standard model , @xmath28 , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 the mass and width of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 are the charges of the final state quarks to which the electro - weak currents directly couple ; @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the electro - weak vector and axial vector coupling constants . for example , in the weinberg - salam model , one has @xmath38 , @xmath39 for leptons , @xmath40 , @xmath41 for up - type quarks ( @xmath42 ) , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 for down - type quarks ( @xmath45 ) . in this paper",
    "we use standard model couplings with @xmath46 .",
    "the second building block is determined by the hadron dynamics , i.e.   by the current - induced production of a heavy quark pair with subsequent gluon emission .",
    "we shall work in terms of the components of the polarized and unpolarized hadronic tensor @xmath47 which are related to the differential rate by @xmath48 the index @xmath49 specifies the current composition in terms of the two parity - conserving products of the vector and the axial vector currents according to ( we drop all further indices on the hadron tensor ) @xmath50    eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) gives the differential cross section for unpolarized beams .",
    "the case of longitudinally polarized beams can easily be included and leads to the replacement @xmath51 in the unpolarized and linearly polarized differential rates @xmath20 where the electroweak coefficients @xmath52 are given in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn3 ] ) and where @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) denote the longitudinal polarization of the electron ( positron ) .",
    "the various pieces of the hadronic tensor can be calculated from the relevant feynman diagrams .",

    "one has @xmath68 in fig .",
    "1(a ) we plot the linear polarization of the gluon as a function of the gluon s fractional energy @xmath69 for the top and charm quark cases ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "we use a c.m .",
    "energy of @xmath71 . at both ends of the spectrum the linear polarization of the gluon is fixed by general and model independent considerations . at the soft gluon end",
    "it is well - known that the linear polarization is 100% while at the hard end of the spectrum the linear polarization has to go to zero for the simple reason that one can no longer define a hadronic plane in this collinear configuration .",
    "these limits can be easily verified by taking the corresponding @xmath72 and @xmath73 limits in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn4 ] ) .",
    "we have chosen to compare the polarization of the gluon in the top and charm quark cases at the same fractional energy @xmath74 .",
    "for a given fractional energy @xmath69 the linear polarization of the gluon is always higher in the top quark case than in the charm quark or mass zero case .",
    "contrary to this one finds a higher degree of polarization in the charm quark case than in the top quark case when comparing the linear polarization at _ fixed gluon energies_. however , a comparison at a fixed fractional energy of the gluon is more appropiate from a physics point of view in particular if one is interested in the average linear polarization of the gluon to be discussed later on .",
    "the linear polarization of the gluon remains above 50% for 85% of the avaliable energy range in the top quark case . as fig .",
    "1(b ) shows , the rate for top quark production is strongly weighted towards smaller gluon energies where the linear polarization is large .",
    "we anticipate a large average linear polarization of the top quark . in the charm quark case",
    "the linear gluon polarization is already quite close to the zero mass case which , according to eq .",
    "( [ eqn5 ] ) , is given by . ]",
    "@xmath75 the good quality of the zero mass formula eq .",
    "( [ eqn6 ] ) when applied to the charm quark case ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) must be judged against the fact that the dominating logarithmic term @xmath78 is not yet overly large .",
    "the linear polarization is flavour independent ( and beam polarization independent ) in the zero mass limit since the flavour dependent @xmath79 factor drops out in the ratio eq .",
    "this is different in the massive case where flavour dependence comes in through the nonvanishing of the hadron tensor component @xmath80 .",
    "it can , however , be checked that the dependence on the electro - weak parameters is also quite weak in the massive quark case .",
    "the reason is two - fold .",
    "first the contributions of @xmath81 and @xmath82 are somewhat suppressed even for top quark pair production .",
    "secondly the rate is dominated by one photon exchange at the energy @xmath76 leading again to a near cancellation of the electro - weak model dependence .",
    "the last step is the integration over the second phase - space parameter @xmath12 .",
    "it is clear that we have to introduce a gluon energy cut - off at the soft end of the gluon spectrum in order to keep the rate finite .",
    "denoting the cut - off energy by @xmath83 the integration extends from @xmath84 to @xmath85 .",
