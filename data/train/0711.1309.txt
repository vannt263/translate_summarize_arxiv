    "a precise measurement of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and its functional dependence on environmental conditions would impact astronomy over a wide range of physical scales .",
    "it would be of great help to theorists in untangling the mysteries of star formation and it is a key input in spectral synthesis models used to interpret the observed properties of galaxies both nearby and in the early universe .    the current question is whether the imf is _ universal_",
    "the same regardless of time and environmental conditions .",
    "@xcite concisely states the current understanding of imf universality .",
    "it is difficult to believe that the imf is universal given the diversity of galaxy types , environments , star formation rates , and populations within galaxies over the range of observable lookback times . on the other hand , while imf measurements do vary they are all consistent with a universal imf within measurement errors and sampling statistics . the only way to proceed then is to strive for smaller measurement errors and improving sample sizes .    a definitive theoretical derivation of the imf does not yet exist .",
    "theoretical approaches to the imf usually center around the jeans mass , @xmath9 , the mass at which a homogeneous gas cloud becomes unstable . at first the collapse of a cloud",
    "is isothermal and the jeans mass decreases which leads to fragmentation of the cloud @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite suggested that at some point during the cloud collapse the line cooling opacity becomes high enough that the collapse is no longer isothermal . at this point the jeans mass increases and fragmentation stops .",
    "the minimum jeans mass is the smallest fragment size at this point and it provides a lower limit to size of the stars formed .",
    "authors have calculated jeans masses and minimum jeans masses using a variety of methods . in the classical derivation of the jeans",
    "mass @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite finds that @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass of gas atoms or molecules and @xmath13 is the opacity at the final fragmentation .",
    "more recently turbulence in clouds has been studied .",
    "@xcite found @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number density and @xmath16 is the velocity dispersion of the gas .",
    "other investigators have looked at the hierarchical fractal geometry of molecular clouds , thought to arise from turbulence , as a generator of the imf ( e.g. @xcite ) . on a related note @xcite point out that molecular clouds exhibit structure on all resolvable spacial scales suggesting that as no characteristic density exists for the clouds neither does a single jeans mass .",
    "they develop a semi - empirical model for determining the final masses of stars from the initial conditions of molecular clouds without invoking jeans mass arguments and use it to construct imf models .",
    "the key components of their model are sound speed and rotation rate of cloud cores and the idea that stars help determine their final masses through winds and outflows .",
    "but from the beginning the study of the imf has been driven by measurements . in 1955",
    "salpeter was the first to make a measurement of the imf inferring it from his observed stellar luminosity function @xcite .",
    "we parameterize the imf by : @xmath17 following @xcite .",
    "salpeter found that @xmath18 .",
    "it is often overlooked that his measurement only covered masses for which @xmath19 .",
    "nonetheless his original measurement is surprisingly consistent with modern values over a wide range of masses .",
    "the imf in equation [ eq : imfbaldry ] is similar to the salpeter imf for @xmath20 .",
    "the difference is that there are fewer stars with masses less than 0.5 @xmath1 .",
    "we adopt a two part power law as there is agreement amongst several authors that there is a change in the imf slope near 0.5 @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the technique we will use is not sensitive to the imf at low masses so we assume a constant value in that regime .",
    "salpeter s idea continues to be used today in imf measurements of resolved stellar populations .",
    "the technique can be applied to field stars as well as clusters .",
    "however salpeter s method has several inherent limitations .",
    "the nature of stars presents a challenge . on the high mass end stars are very luminous , but live only a few million years , while on the low end stars are faint but have lifetimes many times longer than the current age of the universe .",
    "there are very few star clusters which are both young and close enough to allow us access to the imf over the full mass range .",
    "in addition , the main sequence mass - luminosity relationship is a function of age , metallicity , and speed of rotation in addition to mass .",
    "it is not yet well - known at the low and high mass extremes .",
    "unresolved binaries can also affect the measured imf @xcite .",
    "the light from unresolved binaries is dominated by the more massive of the pair . as a result",
    "the less massive star is typically not detected which leads to a systematic under - counting of low mass stars .",
    "@xmath22 of main sequence m stars @xcite and 43% of main sequence g stars @xcite are primary stars in multiple star systems .",
    "these are both lower limits as some companions may have eluded detection .",
    "as roughly half of stars are in multiple systems it has a potentially large effect on the observed luminosity function .    except for at the high mass end field stars in the solar neighborhood",
    "offer the best statistics for imf measurements .",
    "however the solar neighborhood imf is found to be deficient in massive stars when compared to other galaxies .",
    "for example the @xcite and @xcite solar neighborhood imfs are rejected by integrated light approaches , i.e. @xcite , hereafter k83 , @xcite ( ktc94 ) , and @xcite .",
    "analysis of individual star clusters can be used to detect imf variations . as methods and",
    "data quality can vary between authors comparisons between individual clusters are difficult .",
    "however @xcite studied eight young open clusters with the same technique . on the extremes they measured @xmath23 for ngc 663 and @xmath24 for ngc 581 over masses from around 1 to 12 m@xmath25 .",
    "@xcite considered the case in which one could have perfect knowledge of the masses of all stars in a cluster .",
    "clusters have a finite size so even with no measurement errors uncertainty arises from sampling the underlying imf .",
    "he shows that the observed scatter in imf power law values above 1 m@xmath25 can be accounted for by sampling bias for clusters with between @xmath26 and @xmath27 members ( the @xcite clusters have memberships in this range ) .",
    "furthermore , dynamical evolution of clusters can affect measurements of the imf .",
    "this can happen by preferentially expelling lower mass stars from the cluster and by breaking up binary systems within the cluster .",
    "in total @xcite finds that for stars with @xmath28 the spread in the observed imf power - law slopes in clusters is around 1 when both binary stars and sampling bias are considered even when the underlying imfs are identical .",
    "stochastic processes can also influence the ability to detect systematic imf variations .",
    "o and b stars produce ionizing photons and cosmic rays which affect the surrounding nebula .",
    "however the probability of creating one of these massive stars is comparatively small .",
    "if one of these massive stars happens by chance to form first it may drive up the nebular temperature and depress the formation of less massive stars compared to regions without massive stars @xcite .",
    "an alternative to imf measurements based on the stellar luminosity functions of resolved stellar populations is to infer the characteristics of stellar populations from the integrated light of galaxies using spectral synthesis models .",
    "the advantage of using integrated light techniques is that many of the problems plaguing imf investigations of resolved stellar populations are avoided .",
    "stochastic effects are washed out over a whole galaxy .",
    "unresolved multiple star systems are irrelevant .",
    "the number of observable galaxies is large and their environments span a much larger range than those of milky way clusters .",
    "integrated light techniques can be applied to the high redshift universe .",
    "this creates a strong motivation to develop imf techniques and test them for galaxies in the local universe which can later be used to probe earlier stages of galaxy formation .",
    "the assumption of a universal imf has a huge influence on the interpretation of the high redshift universe .",
    "the reionization of the universe and the madau plot the global star formation rate of the universe over cosmic history are two areas where imf variations could impact the current picture of galaxy formation and evolution .    on the downside conclusions are dependent on the stellar evolution models used , which are not well constrained at high masses or with horizontal branch stars at low metallicities .",
    "the biggest problem is that changes in the imf , star formation history ( sfh ) or age of a galaxy model can have similar effects in the resulting spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "any integrated light technique needs to address these degeneracies .",
    "it is also difficult to probe the imf at sub - solar masses using integrated light .    on the level of galaxies the concept of a universal",
    "imf has recently become more complicated .",
    "a number of recent studies have investigated the effect of summing the imf in individual clusters over a galaxy in the presence of power law star cluster mass functions .",
    "@xcite argue that the integrated galaxial imf will appear to vary as function of galactic stellar mass even if the stellar imf is universal .",
    "however @xcite argues that the galaxy wide imf should not differ from the imf in individual clusters based on analytical arguments and monte carlo simulations .",
    "our approach can only measure the imf averaged over whole galaxies and can not address this distinction .",
    "even so systematic variations of any kind from the salpeter slope have not been measured outside of some evidence for non - standard imfs in low surface brightness galaxies ( lsb ) and galaxies experiencing powerful bursts of star formation @xcite .",
    "either way , observational evidence for systematic variations of the imf in galaxies would be highly valuable .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows :  2 explains our method for constraining the imf . in ",
    "3 we describe the sdss data and our sample selection . ",
    "4 details our modeling scheme . in  5",
    "we discuss our statistical techniques .",
    " 6 reports our results . in  7 we check our results against the h@xmath29 distribution of the data and  8 presents our conclusions .",
    "this paper revisits the `` classic '' method of k83 ( and the subsequent extension ktc94 ) to constrain the imf of integrated stellar populations .",
    "the method takes advantage of the sensitivity of the h@xmath0 equivalent width ( ew ) to the imf .",
    "k83 showed that model imf tracks can be differentiated in the @xmath30 plane .",
    "the total flux of a galaxy at 6565  is the combination of the underlying continuum flux plus the flux contained in the h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "the h@xmath0 flux and the continuum flux have different physical origins , both of which can be used to gain physical insights into galaxies .    in the absence of agn activity",
    "the h@xmath0 flux is predominantly caused by massive o and b stars which emit ionizing photons in the ultraviolet .",
    "o and b stars are young and found in the regions of neutral hydrogen in which they formed . in case b recombination , where it is assumed that these clouds are optically thick ,",
    "any emitted lyman photons are immediately reabsorbed .",
    "after several scattering events the lyman photons are converted into lower series photons ( including h@xmath0 ) and two photon emission in the @xmath31 continuum .",
    "these photons experience smaller optical depths and can escape the cloud .",
    "the transition probabilities are weakly dependent on electron density and temperature and can be calculated . through this process",
    "the measured h@xmath0 flux can be converted into the number of o and b stars currently burning in an integrated stellar population .",
    "however case b recombination is an idealized condition and it is possible that ionizing photons can escape the cloud without this processing , a situation known as lyman leakage .",
    "as such the h@xmath0 flux is a lower limit on the number of o and b stars present .",
    "the continuum flux of a galaxy is due to the underlying stellar population . at 6565",
    "the continuum is dominated by red giant stars in the 0.7 - 3 m@xmath25 range while the h@xmath0 flux comes from stars more massive than 10 m@xmath25 .",
    "the ew is defined as the width in angstroms of an imaginary box with a height equal to the continuum flux level surrounding an emission or absorption line which contains an area equal to the area contained in the line .",
    "this is effectively the ratio of the strength of a emission or absorption line to the strength of the continuum at the same wavelength .",
    "given the physical origins of the h@xmath0 flux and the continuum at 6565  the h@xmath0 ew is the ratio of massive o and b stars to stars around a solar mass . therefore the h@xmath0 ew is sensitive to the imf slope above around 1 m@xmath32 and can be used to probe the imf in galaxies .    as mentioned in the introduction several degeneracies plague the study of the imf from the integrated light properties of galaxies .",
    "variations in the imf , age , metallicity , and sfh of galaxy models can all yield similar effects in the resulting spectra .",
    "for example , increasing the fraction of massive stars , reducing the age of a galaxy , lowering the metallicity , and a recent increase in the star formation rate will all make a galaxy bluer .",
    "metallicity effects were not discussed in either k83 or ktc94 and galaxy ages were assumed , 15 gyr for k83 and 10 gyr for ktc94 .",
    "the sfh in k83 is addressed by calculating models with exponentially decreasing sfhs for a range of e - folding times , as well as a constant and a linearly increasing sfh . in the @xmath30 plane",
    "the effect of varying the sfh e - folding time is orthogonal to imf variations .",
    "however this is only true for smoothly varying exponential and linear sfhs .",
    "discontinuities , either increases ( bursts ) or decreases ( gasps ) , in the star formation rate can affect the h@xmath0 ew relative to the color in ways similar to a change in the imf",
    ". along with the exponential sfhs ktc94 also uses models with instantaneous bursts on top of constant sfhs .",
    "however this was done to access high ews at an age of 10 gyr rather than to fully flesh out the effects of sfh discontinuities .",
    "the assumption of smoothly varying sfhs is a key assumption in our analysis .",
    "most late - type galaxies are thought to form stars at a fairly steady rate over much of recent time although bursts of star formation may play a significant role in low mass galaxies @xcite . for these galaxies",
    "smoothly varying sfhs are justified .",
    "however there are other galaxies clearly in the midst of a strong burst of star formation ( e.g. m82 ) and dwarf galaxies with complex sfhs , e.g. ngc 1569 @xcite , for which this assumption is a poor one .",
    "the effects of violations of our sfh assumptions are described in detail in the results section .",
    "k83 cites four major sources of error all of which are improved upon or eliminated by the high , uniform quality of sdss spectroscopic and photometric data .",
    "the h@xmath0 fluxes in his sample can be contaminated by nonthermal nuclear emission . in the updated investigation , ktc94",
    ", this problem is addressed by removing objects with known seyfert or liner activity and luminous agn . the sdss spectra allow measurements of emission line ratios which can be used to separate star forming galaxies from agn @xcite .",
    "the second problem is that the h@xmath0 emission flux will be underestimated if the underlying stellar absorption of h@xmath0 is not taken into consideration .",
    "the narrow band filter photometry of @xcite could not measure this effect for individual galaxies so a fixed ratio was assumed for all galaxies .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic pipeline does not take this into account either .",
    "we use the h@xmath0 fluxes measured from the sdss spectra by @xcite which fit the continua with stellar population models to more accurately measure the h@xmath0 emission . while the sdss pipeline method is sufficient for strong emission lines the h@xmath0 absorption ew can be as large as 5   which is significant for weaker emission lines .",
    "thirdly , their narrow band h@xmath0 imaging includes [ ] emission which is corrected for by assuming a constant [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio .",
    "the h@xmath0 and [ ] emission lines are resolved in the sdss spectra so there is no need for a correction .",
    "this is a significant improvement .",
    "@xcite found from a literature survey that the mean value of the h@xmath0/(h@xmath0 + [ ] ) ratio is @xmath33 for spiral galaxies and @xmath34 in irregular galaxies .",
    "these mean corrections were applied uniformly to the k83 data . in ktc94",
    "a uniform correction was applied using [ ] /h@xmath0 = 0.5 . for comparison in our sample the mean value of",
    "the h@xmath0/(h@xmath0 + [ ] ) ratio is a strikingly similar 0.752 and the mean [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio is 0.340 .",
    "however [ ] /h@xmath0 ranges from 0.0 to 0.6 .",
    "if our h@xmath0 and [ ] lines were blended , applying a fixed correction would introduce errors of as much as 25% in the h@xmath0 ews of individual galaxies .",
    "lastly , in both k83 and ktc94 extinction corrections were addressed by plotting data alongside models which were either assumed an average value for the extinction or were unextincted .",
    "the balmer decrement ( h@xmath0/h@xmath35 ) can be measured from sdss spectra which allows for extinction corrections for individual galaxies .",
    "another major advantage of this study is that the sample size is much larger than that of k83 and ktc94 .",
    "the ktc94 sample contains 210 galaxies , whereas ours has @xmath36 .",
    "the large sample size allows us to investigate imf trends as functions of galaxy luminosity , redshift and aperture fraction with subsamples larger than the entire ktc94 sample .",
    "there is a key disadvantage to this method as well .",
    "k83 and ktc94 were able to adjust the sizes of their photometric apertures to contain the entire disk of individual galaxies to a limiting isophote of 25@xmath37 given by the rc2 catalog @xcite .",
    "the advantage of narrow band measurements of h@xmath0 ew is that they can cover a much larger aperture and match the broadband measurements set to match the physical size of individual galaxies .",
    "the sdss has fixed 3 `` spectroscopic apertures .",
    "this problem is partly offset by using matching 3 '' photometry apertures from the sdss .",
    "however this introduces aperture effects as observed galaxies have a wide range of angular sizes due to the range of physical sizes and distances present in the local universe .",
    "this is significant as radial metallicity gradients ( e.g. @xcite ) are observed in spiral galaxies which could incorrectly be interpreted as radial imf gradients .",
    "even so , this method can constrain the imf within the sdss apertures . for our program galaxies 23% of the total",
    "light falls in the sdss apertures .",
    "the fact that the more distant galaxies are more luminous and tend to be larger helps to balance out the larger physical scales of the fixed aperture size at greater distances . on average",
    "17% of the light falls in the aperture for the faintest galaxies while it is 25% for the brightest bin . in spite of their limited size",
    "the sdss apertures still contain a great diversity of stellar populations which make this data set an excellent test bed for imf universality .",
    "we will present extensive tests of aperture effects below .",
    "the sample is selected from sloan digital sky survey data .",
    "the project goal of the sdss is to image a quarter of the sky in five optical bands with a dedicated 2.5 m telescope @xcite . from the imaging",
    "@xmath38 galaxies and @xmath39 quasars will be selected for spectroscopic followup .",
    "photometry is done in the @xmath40 filter system described by @xcite .",
    "magnitudes are on the ` arcsinh ` system @xcite which approaches the ab system with increasing brightness .",
    "spectra are taken with a multi - object fiber spectrograph with wavelength coverage from 3800  to 9200  and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "our sample is a sub - sample of the main galaxy sample from sdss dr4 @xcite .",
    "the main galaxy sample ( mgs ) targets galaxies with @xmath42 in petrosian magnitudes @xcite .",
    "all galaxies in the mgs are strong detections so the differences between luptitudes and the ab system can be ignored . in order to avoid fiber crosstalk in the camera an upper brightness limit of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 is imposed .",
    "targets are selected as galaxies from the imaging by comparing their psf magnitudes to their de vaccouleur s and exponential profile magnitudes .",
    "exposure times for spectroscopy are set so that the cumulative median signal - to - noise satisfies @xmath46 at @xmath47 and @xmath48 fiber magnitudes .",
    "the time to achieve this depends on observing conditions but always involves at minimum three 15 minute exposures .    due to the construction of the spectrograph fibers can not be placed closer than 55 \" to each other .",
    "this may be a source of bias in the sample .",
    "cluster galaxies may be preferentially excluded from the sample .",
    "the sdss collaboration has plans to quantify this effect in the near future @xcite .",
    "lsbs are excluded from the mgs with a surface brightness cut which may also bias the sample @xcite .",
    "there is some evidence that lsbs may have imfs which differ from a universal imf .",
    "@xcite find that the comparatively high mass - to - light ratios of lsbs can be explained with an imf deficient in massive stars relative to normal galaxies .",
    "our sample begins with the fourth data release ( dr4 ) of the sdss @xcite .",
    "dr4 covers 4783 deg@xmath49 in spectroscopy for a total of 673,280 spectra , 567,486 of which are galaxy spectra .",
    "429,748 of these have flags set indicating they are part of the mgs .",
    "dr4 also includes special spectroscopic observations of the southern stripe which were not selected by the standard algorithm but which nonetheless have the ` target_galaxy ` flag set in ` primtarget ` which usually indicates membership in the mgs .",
    "these objects are identified by comparing their spectroscopic plate number to the list of special plates in @xcite and rejected .",
    "this leaves 423,285 spectra .    the first round of cuts to our sample address general data quality .",
    "while the overall quality of sdss data is high there are a handful of objects with pathological values for one or more parameters .",
    "first we require that all parameters of interest have reasonable , real values .",
    "this means that the petrosian and fiber magnitudes must be between 0 and 25 and have errors smaller than 0.5 in all five @xmath40 bands .",
    "line flux errors are capped at @xmath50 @xmath51 and equivalent widths at @xmath39 . for most of the parameters",
    "less than 1% of objects fail this loose requirement .",
    "however 6.6% of the objects fail the petrosian magnitude error requirement .",
    "this is most likely due to the photometric pipeline having a difficult time defining the petrosian radius .",
    "as such this constraint is potentially biased against lsbs or galaxies with unusual morphologies . in defense of this cut",
    "we later bin our data by luminosity and aperture fraction both of which are determined in part by the petrosian magnitudes and also by @xmath52-corrections determined from them .",
    "in addition , limiting flux errors to 50% is hardly unreasonable .",
    "altogether 391,160 galaxies pass these combined requirements , which is 92.4% of the mgs .",
    "galaxies from photometry run 1659 are removed because of a known problem with the photometry .",
    "this excludes 4,485 galaxies ( 1.1% ) from a continuous strip on the sky and should not be a source of bias .",
    "we place a further constraint on the @xmath53 band fiber magnitude requiring that the error be less than 0.15 .",
    "the @xmath53 band generally suffers from the most noise so this requirement ensures that the fiber magnitude quality is good enough to minimize the chance of erroneous @xmath52-corrections which could affect our colors .",
    "only 2,866 ( 0.7% ) mgs galaxies fail this test .    combining the general data quality requirements , the run 1659 rejection and the fiber @xmath53 band error limit leaves 386,647 galaxies ( 91.3% of the mgs ) .    the next round of cuts to our sample , while necessary , have clear astrophysical implications .",
    "many of the objects in the mgs have agn components .",
    "as we are interested in studying only the underlying stellar populations of these objects agn must be removed .",
    "this is done using the classical @xcite diagram comparing the logarithms of the [ @xmath54/h@xmath35 and [ @xmath55/h@xmath0 emission line ratios .",
    "we used the criterion of @xcite where objects for which @xmath56/\\rm h\\beta ) > \\frac{0.61}{\\log([\\rm{n\\ ii}]/h\\alpha)-0.05}+1.3 \\label{eq : kbpt}\\ ] ] are classified as agn and rejected .",
    "following @xcite we require the s / n of the h@xmath0 , h@xmath35 , [ ] and [ ] lines to be at least 3 to properly classify a galaxy as a star forming one .",
    "131,807 galaxies ( 34.1% of mgs objects surviving our first round of cuts ) survive this cut .",
    "the above cut automatically rejects any galaxies with weak [ ] and [ ] lines .",
    "this excludes galaxies with weak star formation .",
    "to a lesser extent metal poor galaxies which also have weak [ ] emission are rejected as well .",
    "@xcite also define a low s / n star forming class of galaxies which we identify and keep in our sample .",
    "these are the galaxies which have not already been classified as star forming or agn by strong lines and equation [ eq : kbpt ] , nor have been identified as low s / n agn by [ @xmath55/h@xmath0 @xmath57 0.6 with s /",
    "n @xmath57 3 in both lines , yet still have h@xmath0 with s /",

    "falls into the low s / n star forming galaxy category . combining the two classes 211,355 ( 54.7% ) of the galaxies survive the agn cut .",
    "the agn cut also has a strong luminosity bias for two reasons .",
    "galaxies with agn components tend to be brighter .",
    "the bimodal distribution of galaxies in color - magnitude space @xcite also plays a role .",
    "the most luminous galaxies are predominantly red with minimal star formation and thus weak emission lines .",
    "luminous galaxies are rejected both for having agn components and for having low s / n emission lines . over 95% of galaxies fainter than @xmath58",
    "meet this criteria , but by @xmath59 the fraction is only 38.9% .    a color bias is also introduced by the agn cut . over 95% of galaxies",
    "bluer than @xmath60 pass , which drops to 24% by @xmath61 .",
    "this is mainly due to the s / n requirement for the emission lines .",
    "redder galaxies tend to have weak emission lines and are rejected .",
    "the balmer decrement is used for the extinction correction so h@xmath0 and h@xmath35 s / n are required to be at least 5 to reduce errors .",
    "214,912 galaxies ( 55.6% ) have h@xmath35 s / n @xmath62 which is the more restrictive of the two criteria .",
    "this cut has a clear luminosity bias .",
    "roughly 85% of galaxies with @xmath63 satisfy this requirement , but this fraction decreases with increasing luminosity until only 12.9% survive at @xmath64 .",
    "this is again due to the bimodal distribution of galaxies .",
    "the luminous red galaxies with weak emission lines are rejected .",
    "there is also a color bias .",
    "over 93% of the bluest galaxies blueward of @xmath65 survive the cut while only 23% of the reddest pass this requirement .",
    "as previously mentioned , by nature the reddest galaxies have weak balmer lines as a result of their low sfrs and are preferentially rejected .",
    "a redshift cut of @xmath66 is applied to ensure that peculiar velocities do not dominate at low redshift and to limit the range of galaxy ages .",
    "384,349 galaxies ( 99.4% ) meet this criteria .",
    "nearly all galaxies from @xmath67 to @xmath68 survive this cut . on the low luminosity end only 27.4% of @xmath69 galaxies are distant enough to pass and on the high end 93.1% of @xmath70 galaxies are close enough to survive .",
    "only 63% of the bluest galaxies pass .",
    "many of the blue galaxies that fail are actually regions of local group galaxies which are treated as their own objects by the sdss pipeline so removing them actually improves the integrity of our sample .",
    "the stellar populations of galactic bulges can be significantly different from those in the spiral arms .",
    "the sdss fibers have a fixed aperture of 3  so over the large range of luminosities and distances in the mgs aperture affects can become very important . to remove outliers",
    "we require that at least 10% of the light from a galaxy falls within the spectroscopic aperture .",
    "this is done by comparing the petrosian magnitude to a fixed 3  aperture fiber magnitude .",
    "both of these quantities are calculated for all objects in the sdss by the photometric pipeline .",
    "371,777 ( 96.2% ) galaxies survive this cut .",

    "so how well are our assumptions justified ?",
    "we have parameterized the imf as a piecewise power law with two components .",
    "piecewise power laws are motivated by empirical fits to data starting with @xcite , which had only one component . by contrast",

    "instead we use this piecewise model and lower the degrees of freedom through physical arguments .",
    "many investigators find a change in slope in the imf around 0.5 m@xmath25 .",
    "our fixed lower end of the imf is designed to be consistent to this .",
    "as our technique is not sensitive to this regime this assumption does not impact the results .",

    "this is achieved by truncation at 0.1 and 120 m@xmath25 .",
    "this seems unphysical as the existence of brown dwarfs suggests that the imf should continue below the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "however , stars at 0.1 m@xmath25 do not contribute much to the integrated light of galaxies .",
    "as we are not sensitive to stars in this mass range this choice is not unreasonable .",
    "in fact , truncating the imf at 0.5 m@xmath25 yields models which are at worse differ by 0.002 in @xmath78 and 3% in h@xmath0 ew from those with low mass stars .",
    "the slope below 0.5 m@xmath25 has essentially no effect on our results .",
    "only when the imf is truncated at 0.9 m@xmath25 do the models differ at the level of the errors in the data .",

    "an analysis of the arches cluster , the youngest observable cluster , gives an upper limit of 150 m@xmath25 based on monte carlo simulations although stars above 130 m@xmath25 are not detected @xcite .",

    "the relationship between the change in the upper mass cutoff ( from 120 m@xmath25 ) and the apparent change in @xmath108 is @xmath110 and is roughly linear for upper mass cutoffs down to 50 m@xmath25 .",
    "the coefficient in the relationship is a week function of the age of the population ranging from 0.004 for 13 gyr old populations to 0.006 for 100 myr old populations .",

    "we note we also have partial degeneracy between parameters such as age and metallicity  they both shift the tracks in similar directions largely orthogonal to @xmath108 ( though not completely which is why we have a stripe in parameter space not a line ) .",

    "on the other hand the @xcite imf , established from a review of star cluster imf studies in the literature , is a better fit than the best @xmath108 value in our parameterization with @xmath148 .",
    "this result highlights the degeneracy of the imf models themselves in the color - h@xmath0 ew plane two considerably different imfs ( one with one break and the other with two ) fit nearly equally as well .",
    "the results of the mc simulation show that the 95% confidence region is @xmath149 for the data set as a whole .",
    "the mc simulation shows that additional data will not improve the overall results as the random errors are already small . clearly and not surprisingly systematic errors , which are discussed later , dominate .",
    "the overall result of @xmath150 is steeper than the original salpeter value of @xmath111 .",
    "it is also steeper than the @xcite value of @xmath151 derived from galaxy luminosity densities in the uv to nir .",
    "it is however well within their 95% confidence limit of @xmath152 as well as their measurement of @xmath153 based on the h@xmath0 luminosity density .",
    "the difference between their two results suggests that the h@xmath0 and mid - uv to optical fluxes may have different sensitivities to massive stars .",
    "@xcite estimated the uncertainty in @xmath108 , either due to measurement uncertainties , real imf variations or both , in his star cluster imf based on the spread of results in the literature .",
    "our result is well within his range of uncertainty in both mass regimes @xmath154 for @xmath155 and @xmath156 for @xmath157 .",

    "given the sizes of the random errors the differences in @xmath108 between @xmath162 and @xmath160 are substantial , from 1.59 to 1.41 , and statistically significant .",
    "the agreement with the salpeter slope is the best for galaxies between @xmath159 and @xmath160 in @xmath158 .    in many ways",
    "it is not surprising that previous investigators have not found this trend .",
    "the milky way is thought to have a luminosity of @xmath163 @xcite ; the @xmath164 and @xmath165 filter curves cover roughly the same wavelengths . at comparable luminosities",
    "our results are similar to salpeter .",
    "the galaxies in the k83 sample have a median @xmath166 with only 16% ( 18 objects ) fainter than @xmath167 @xcite .",
    "this is a significant bias toward more luminous galaxies where our results are in agreement with a universal imf .",
    "by contrast 30% of our sample is fainter than @xmath168 @xcite .",
    "we have a sample of 39,350 galaxies fainter than @xmath169 .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ fig : allmagr ] shows that the relative quality of the fits rapidly deteriorates as the luminosity of the galaxies decrease . for the brightest galaxies @xmath138 floats around 0.15 , while in the faintest bin it is over 6 . for comparison @xmath170 for the large magellanic cloud and @xmath171 for the small magellanic cloud @xcite",
    "this trend could indicate that a universal imf is a good fit to the most luminous galaxies , but dwarf galaxies can not be described by a universal imf , even if a different universal slope is allowed .",
    "however it could have a more mundane explanation .",
    "it could be that errors are over or underestimated as a function of luminosity .",
    "it also could arise from deviations from our assumption of smoothly varying sfhs .",
    "we can not bin our data by stellar mass without assuming an imf which is contrary to the goals of the project .",
    "we can repeat the analysis of figure [ fig : allmagr ] using @xmath172 in the place of @xmath158 .",
    "@xmath172 , being redder , is a better proxy to stellar mass .",

    "the rest of this section focuses whether this trend is a manifestation of true imf variations or if it is the result of sample biases or poor assumptions .",
    "if the imf is truly universal and our method successfully probes the imf any subsample of galaxies that we could choose should yield the same @xmath173 value as any other in spite of any selection biases or aperture effects .",
    "figure [ fig : allmagr ] clearly shows that the preceding statement is false . in this section",
    "we set aside the possibility of imf variations and search for biases in our sample .",
    "figure [ fig : allmagr ] shows that the overall result of @xmath174 is really a weighted average .",
    "the sdss mgs is a magnitude limited sample , one defined by flux limits , with both upper and lower limits .",
    "table [ tab : lumbins ] gives the number of objects in each luminosity bin .",
    "there are 41,411 galaxies with @xmath175 but only 28 for which @xmath176 .",
    "as such the overall result is heavily biased by more luminous galaxies .",
    "malmquist bias will affect any magnitude limited sample . because brighter objects can be seen at greater distances a magnitude limited sample contains bright objects from a greater volume of space than fainter objects .",
    "the result is that the ratio objects by luminosity in a magnitude limited sample differs from the true ratio in nature ; brighter objects are over - represented .    to eliminate malmquist bias volume limited bins where subsamples are complete for a range of luminosities are constructed .",
    "figure [ fig : vl - def ] details the construction of these bins .",
    "given both the upper and lower flux limits of the mgs ( @xmath177 ) only a factor of 13 in luminosity falls in the sample at any given redshift .",
    "the redshift limits of each volume limited bin are defined such that no galaxies within the magnitude limits of the bin are affected by the flux limits of the mgs . within each box in figure",
    "[ fig : vl - def ] the true ratio of galaxy luminosities is preserved and is thus free of malmquist bias .",
    "figure [ fig : vl - plot ] shows the results for volume limited magnitude bins .",
    "most error bars are smaller than the plotting symbols due to the larger number of galaxies , 329 to 29,701 as given in table [ tab : lumbins ] , in each bin . figures [ fig : allmagr ] and [ fig : vl - plot ] show the exact same trends . the largest difference in @xmath108 between the whole and volume limited samples is 0.0116 in the @xmath67 bin .",
    "the other notable difference is that the fainter galaxies have larger @xmath138 values in the volume limited case .",
    "however malmquist bias across bins is not responsible for the luminosity trends in figure [ fig : allmagr ] .",
    "another effect of magnitude limited samples is that the faintest galaxies are much closer than the most luminous ones .",
    "the mean redshifts of the volume limited magnitude bins range from @xmath178 for @xmath67 to @xmath179 for @xmath180 .",
    "this corresponds to a difference in age of around 1.8 gyr . as aforementioned",
    ", model tracks reveal that age is largely orthogonal to the imf in our parameter space , but there could be other effects tied to age and distance .",
    "in addition the imf could evolve with time .",
    "the large number of galaxies in our sample affords us the luxury of investigating the effects of luminosity and redshift simultaneously to obtain a better understanding of what role , if any , the redshift plays in our analysis .",
    "figure [ fig : redshift ] shows our fitted parameters for all 130,602 galaxies in bins that are 0.25 magnitudes wide in luminosity and 0.005 wide in redshift .",
    "the upper left panel shows the best fitting @xmath108 for each two dimensional bin . on the upper right the width of the 95% confidence region in @xmath108 for each bin",
    "is shown . at bottom left",
    "is the @xmath181 and at bottom right is the log of the number of galaxies in each bin .",
    "the white contour demarcates the region in which each bin contains at least 50 galaxies .",
    "the number 50 is arbitrary but it shows the region where poisson errors are expected to be small .",
    "the black areas are regions where there are no galaxies with the given parameters .    using the plot of @xmath108 at the upper left we can look for potential redshift biases .",
    "this is complicated by the fact that at a fixed luminosity there is a limit to the range of redshifts in the sample due to the flux limits of the sample described earlier .",
    "looking at vertical slices through the plot at any fixed luminosity there is a trend towards larger values of @xmath108 with increasing redshift .",
    "however , for horizontal slices of fixed redshift the same relationship between @xmath108 and luminosity that is present for the whole sample is seen modulo a normalization factor .",
    "the right half of figure [ fig : redshift ] shows a strong relationship between the number of galaxies per bin and the width of the 95% confidence region in @xmath108 .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that larger samples are less affected by poisson errors .",
    "the lower left panel of figure [ fig : redshift ] provides an excellent example of why our metric of fit quality , @xmath138 , is so important .",
    "bins with similar numbers of galaxies and @xmath182 values can have vastly different values of @xmath138 .",
    "it is worth reminding that the contours in @xmath138 are logarithmic . at fixed luminosity",
    "the galaxies are better fit by a universal imf at higher redshift .",
    "similar to the sample as a whole the quality of fit improves with luminosity .",
    "while there does appear to be some weak trending of @xmath108 and @xmath138 with redshift , redshift effects are not driving the relationship seen between imf and luminosity as it persists at fixed redshifts .",
    "one explanation for the trend in @xmath108 with redshift is aperture effects .",
    "again , if the imf is truly universal aperture effects should not exist .",
    "the sdss spectra have a fixed aperture of 3  for all galaxies . depending on the angular extent and distance to a galaxy",
    "a different fraction of the total light of the galaxy will fall into the aperture .",
    "the problem is mitigated by the fact that the most distant galaxies are the most luminous and more likely to have a larger physical size . as the physical area contained in the aperture increases with distance ,",
    "so too does the size of the galaxies being observed .",
    "however , the two effects do not exactly balance out .",
    "table [ tab : lumbins ] shows that the mean aperture fraction for the @xmath183 bin is 0.20 and increases to 0.27 at @xmath184 . on average",
    "35% more of the most luminous galaxies fall within the aperture compared to the faintest .",
    "figure [ fig : aperture ] shows the behavior of our fitted parameters for two dimensional bins of luminosity and aperture fraction in the same manner as figure [ fig : redshift ] did for luminosity and redshift . for fixed luminosities increasing aperture fraction leads to decreasing values of @xmath108 .",
    "however at fixed aperture fraction the qualitative imf - luminosity trend remains .",
    "the @xmath138 values are a strong function of luminosity , but @xmath138 does increase with aperture fraction at each fixed luminosity .",
    "the trend with aperture fraction is the exact opposite of what would be expected in the presence of a systematic effect operating given the redshift result in figure [ fig : redshift ] .",
    "the nearest galaxies should have the smallest aperture fractions in a particular luminosity bin .",
    "the nearest galaxies in figure [ fig : redshift ] have the smallest values of @xmath108 while the smallest aperture fractions in figure [ fig : aperture ] have the largest values of @xmath108 .",
    "figure [ fig : aperture ] suggests that the measured imf is more dependent on the aperture fraction than the redshift .",
    "there are several possible physical explanations for imf trends with the aperture fraction , all of which are related to radial gradients in disk galaxies .",
    "@xcite make the theory based claim that the imf should be a function of the original local temperature of the star - forming molecular clouds .",
    "metallicity gradients are also known to exist in disk galaxies , including the milky way @xcite .",
    "@xcite measure a linear , radial light metal ( c , o , mg & si ) abundance gradient of @xmath185 in the disk of the milky way .",
    "given the increased efficiency of cooling with metal lines we would expect the most low mass stars where metallicity is the highest on average towards the center of galaxies .",
    "the trend in @xmath108 in figure [ fig : aperture ] is qualitatively consistent with this idea .    if there are radial imf gradients in galaxies one would expect the fits to decrease in quality with increasing aperture fraction .",
    "a blend of imfs will not be fit as well as a universal one given our technique .",
    "this idea is consistent with the results in figure [ fig : aperture ] .",
    "however , in well - resolved stellar populations there is no evidence for a relationship between the imf and metallicity , except perhaps at masses lower than those probed by our method @xcite .",
    "if metallicity plays a role in determining the imf the effects are only being revealed as a global trend in our large sample of integrated stellar populations . for individual clusters metallicity must play a secondary role to stochastic effects .",
    "the extinction correction is another potential source of bias .",
    "it is possible that there is a second order correction that our fairly simple extinction correction fails to take into account .",
    "this could potentially lead to an erroneous imf trend with extinction correction .",
    "this affects the luminosity results because more luminous galaxies tend to be dustier , as evidenced in table [ tab : lumbins ] .",
    "the problem is further complicated by the fact that dust is thought to play an integral part in star formation so it is not unreasonable that an observed imf trend with extinction may be real .",
    "figure [ fig : extinction ] , similar to figures [ fig : redshift ] and [ fig : aperture ] , shows the results of our analysis for two dimensional bins of luminosity and the extinction correction that was measured and applied .",
    "vertical slices through the upper left panel of figure [ fig : extinction ] show that @xmath108 does depend on @xmath186 , trending towards lower @xmath108 values with increased extinction over the region where the poisson error in @xmath108 is reasonable . yet",
    "again , horizontal cuts of fixed extinction show the imf - luminosity relationship .",
    "the decreasing @xmath108 values with increasing extinction is counter - intuitive .",
    "dustier regions tend to be more metal rich .",
    "if metal cooling plays a significant role in the imf the dustiest regions should have the steepest imfs .    at fixed luminosity",
    "@xmath138 increases with extinction .",
    "as aforementioned our calculated errors in color and ew ( equations [ eq : sigmac ] and [ eq : sigmaw ] ) have a functional dependence on the observed emission line extinction . in both cases",
    "it is the term proportional to @xmath187 which is on average the major contributor to the calculated error .",
    "because luminous galaxies tend to be more heavily extincted they will also be more likely to have larger errors .",
    "this is potentially problematic for our observed imf trend with luminosity . if we are unknowingly underestimating the errors for faint galaxies with low extinction the source of the poor fit qualities of these galaxies",
    "could be systematic instead of astrophysical .",
    "however the lower left panel of figure [ fig : extinction ] shows that the most extincted galaxies have the poorest fits where such a bias would suggest that they should fit the best due to the large accommodating errors .",
    "it is also possible that biases in our @xmath108 measurements could depend on two parameters simultaneously .",
    "figure [ fig : avap ] shows the measured galaxy of @xmath108 as a function of both aperture fraction and measured emission line extinction for six volume limited luminosity bins .    when holding all other parameters fixed , increasing the aperture fraction leads to lower values of @xmath108 in all statistically significant areas of figure [ fig : avap ] .",
    "this is the same relationship found in the earlier section on aperture fraction . decreasing values of @xmath108",
    "are also seen for increasing extinction when all other parameters are constant . a notable exception to this",
    "is that galaxies with large extinction and small aperture fractions favor higher @xmath108 values .",
    "most importantly when looking at a particular combination of aperture fraction and extinction the imf becomes shallower with increasing luminosity until the highest luminosities where it becomes steeper again . even in the narrowest slices of the data",
    "set the same imf - luminosity trend is seen , albeit with slightly different absolute values of @xmath108 .      as discussed",
    "previously we have allowed two classes of star forming galaxies into our sample .",
    "111,806 galaxies ( 86% ) fall in the star forming class and the other 18,796 ( 14% ) belong to the low s / n star forming class where the or lines are weak , but the h@xmath0 and h@xmath35 lines still have s / n @xmath188 . by comparing the results from these two subsamples we can investigate a possible bias of the results with respect to the level of star formation .",
    "figure [ fig : sfclass ] shows the results for both classes as a function of luminosity . as it comprises 86% of the total sample it is not surprising that the results for the star forming class are similar to those of the sample as a whole in figure [ fig : allmagr ] .",
    "the low s / n class exhibits a similar qualitative behavior to the set as a whole with a few notable differences .",
    "the @xmath108 values are offset by at least 0.08 towards larger @xmath108 .",
    "the measured imf turns toward steeper values at lower luminosities than for the sample as a whole .",
    "the @xmath138 are several times lower as well .    while the galaxies in low s / n class meet the same requirement of s / n @xmath57 5 in the balmer lines as the star forming class they are biased towards noisier h@xmath0 line measurements .",
    "this corresponds to lines that are either weak ( low sfr ) or weak compared to the continuum ( low present sfr compared to the past ) both of which lead to low ews .",
    "another issue at play is that the relationship between the h@xmath0 line flux and the sfr is dependent on the imf . at a fixed metallicity and sfr increasing @xmath108 by 0.05 reduces the h@xmath0 flux by 20% .",
    "in fact the h@xmath0 flux of a galaxy with @xmath142 will be 33 times larger than a galaxy with the same sfr and @xmath145 . in the presence of real imf variations at any fixed luminosity",
    "the low s / n class will be biased towards galaxies with steeper imfs . both low sfrs and steep imfs potentially lead to low s / n h@xmath0 flux .",
    "however it is difficult to determine the level of influence of each effect .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : grha_data ] low h@xmath0 ews lead to larger values of @xmath108 for any fixed color .",
    "as the low s / n class tends toward noisier h@xmath0 fluxes and therefore ews it is easy to see from equations [ eq : sigmac ] , [ eq : sigmaav ] and [ eq : sigmaw ] that the errors for this class will tend to be larger .",
    "this in turn leads to lower @xmath118 values .",
    "as the qualitative imf - luminosity trend occurs in both star forming classes the strength of star formation is unlikely to be a significant bias on our results .      as mentioned in the data corrections section , the @xmath95 ratio is ratio of the extinction experienced by the nebular emission lines to that experienced by the stellar continuum .",
    "the assumption of a value for @xmath95 could potentially bias our results",
    ". an alternative way of looking at the same problem is that our data in the color - h@xmath0 ew plane can be used to constrain the @xmath95 ratio by assuming a universal salpeter imf .",
    "figure [ fig : f - all ] gives the results of this analysis for the data set as a whole .",
    "a value of @xmath189 is found with @xmath190 .",
    "this is in good agreement with to the @xcite value of @xmath191 .",
    "the quality of the fit in the best case is worse than in figure [ fig : all - like ] .",
    "part of the reason for this is that the errors used were slightly smaller as the @xmath97 terms in equations [ eq : sigmac ] and [ eq : sigmaw ] are set equal to 0 .",
    "the quality of the fit drops sharply below @xmath115 and more gradually for @xmath192 .",
    "values of @xmath95 near 1 are heavily rejected .",
    "however in this particular plot the results are dominated by luminous galaxies .",
    "the values of @xmath95 as a function of luminosity are shown in figure [ fig : f - vl ] .",
    "for galaxies @xmath193 and brighter the best value of @xmath95 is consistent with @xmath115 .",
    "the faintest two bins the prefer an @xmath95 ratio closer to 2.5 .",
    "however the lower panel shows that this new @xmath95 value does not translate to improved fit quality .",
    "in fact the faintest galaxies have in general smaller measured extinctions and are therefore less susceptible to changes in @xmath95 .",
    "the same qualitative trend of worsening fits with decreasing luminosity seen when allowing @xmath108 to float is seen with a varying @xmath95 value .",
    "together these two @xmath95 ratio plots provide a number of insights . for one",
    "it shows that our choice of the @xmath95 ratio is very sensible and provides an independent confirmation of other @xmath95 ratio measurements .",
    "the fact that our best fitting @xmath108 values are at least 0.05 above the salpeter value can not be reconciled by changing the geometry of the dust screen .",
    "it provides further evidence that the relationship between @xmath108 and luminosity is not a function of extinction or a byproduct of our extinction correction .      in this section",
    "we have investigated several possible sources of bias to account for our observed trend between the imf and luminosity .",
    "relationships between the imf and redshift , aperture fraction , extinction and star formation strength have been uncovered .",
    "two parameter biases were also found .    in all cases in narrow slices through the data where potential biases are held fixed the qualitative imf - luminosity relationship appears .",
    "the parameters primarily act to offset the value of @xmath108 at a particular luminosity .",
    "the ratio of continuum to emission line extinction , @xmath95 , was found to be a sensible choice and the results are not sensitive to small changes in this value .",
    "there are two possible interpretations to the relationships between the imf and potential biases .",
    "one is that they are systematic effects due to some problem with our measurement of @xmath108 .",
    "the second is that they are real physical effects .",
    "it is not clear from the data which of these statements is more correct .      in the previous section",
    "several possible sources of bias were investigated , but none were able to account for our observed trend in @xmath108 with luminosity or the inability of a universal imf to fit low luminosity galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : hagr1723 ] shows the distribution in color - h@xmath0 ew space for the least and most luminous bins , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . from this figure it is apparent that the most luminous galaxies lie roughly parallel to the imf tracks while the faintest galaxies are more perpendicular to the tracks . in the low luminosity bin",
    "there are galaxies which are simultaneously blue and have low ews .",
    "these galaxies are not consistent with a universal imf with @xmath111 and as mentioned before are not consistent with a universal imf with a different slope .",
    "in addition the faintest galaxies have the lowest extinctions they are the least sensitive to dust and @xmath95 ratio issues . before concluding that this is evidence for imf variations we must first consider whether our model assumption of smooth sfhs is justified .      the sfh of individual galaxies is the most problematic aspect of the k83 analysis .",
    "a sudden burst on top of a smoothly varying background will immediately increase the h@xmath0 ew .",
    "this is due to the formation of o and b stars which indirectly increase the h@xmath0 flux through processing of their ionizing photons .",
    "the new presence of o and b stars also makes the color of the galaxy bluer .",
    "both of these effects are proportional to the size of the burst .",
    "after the burst is over the h@xmath0 ew is smaller and the colors are redder than they would be if the burst had not occurred .",
    "the h@xmath0 ew drops because there is no longer an excess of o and b stars and their ionizing photons which reduces the h@xmath0 flux to pre - burst levels .",
    "however there is now an excess of red giants due to the less massive stars from the burst leaving the main sequence .",
    "this increases the continuum around the h@xmath0 line which further drops the ew in addition to making the galaxy colors redder . after enough time has elapsed after the burst the galaxy returns to the same position in the color - h@xmath0 ew plane it would have occupied had no burst occurred , although it will have taken longer to get there .",
    "figure [ fig : burst ] gives one example of this cycle . a solar metallicity galaxy with @xmath111 and an exponentially decreasing sfh with @xmath194 gyr experiences a burst of star formation at an age of 4.113 gyr which lasts 250 myr and forms 10% of the stellar mass .",
    "the black dots , spaced at 100 myr intervals , show that comparatively more time is spent below the nominal track than above it .",
    "the peak h@xmath0 ew is reached just 5 myr after the start of the burst . if you happen to be observing the galaxy during the burst a shallower imf",
    "will be measured ( assuming a burst - free sfh ) , after the burst for 1 gyr a steeper imf will be measured and after that the effects of the burst largely disappear , although the galaxy will appear younger than it actually is .",
    "figure [ fig : burstfit ] gives the best fitting imf slope from our analysis , which assumes no bursts , as a function of age for the galaxy in figure [ fig : burst ] .",
    "the jitter in the best fit @xmath108 values is due to the discrete nature of our model grid , and the fact that the model tracks for different imfs run together at large ages . within a 300 myr period during and just after the burst the best fitting imf slope is anywhere from @xmath195 to 1.95 .",
    "this shows that even if a universal imf exists the sfh can mimic a huge range of imf models .",
    "roughly 1 gyr after the burst the measured imf is back to its true value .",
    "a galaxy with a bursty sfh viewed at a random time will be biased toward a steeper imf than what is the true imf .",
    "while one model is not an exhaustive study of the effects of the sfh on imf measurements it does give a good sense of what issues arise .    to eliminate this uncertainty we investigated cutting the sample on sfh . in order to detect a relative lack or excess of present star formation",
    "it is necessary to measure both the present and past star formation rates or at least be able to compare the two in some way .",
    "the problem lies in the fact that conversions of observables into star formation rates assume an imf to do so .",
    "our aim is to measure the imf so we can not make strong a priori assumptions about it .",
    "instead of biasing or results from the start we fit all galaxies and then try to determine the affect of sfhs on our conclusions .",
    "the simplest burst model is that of a single burst at a random time on top of our smooth exponential sfhs .",
    "a grid of 1000 sfhs was constructed by first selecting one of the 24 smoothly varying sfhs at random .",
    "a burst lasting 200 myr was superposed on the sfh at a time selected uniformly at random over a range of 12.5 gyr .",
    "the strength of the burst was randomly selected up to 40% of the total stellar mass , with preference given to smaller bursts .",
    "the colors and ews of these sfhs were calculated at 1 myr intervals over 12.5 gyr for the imfs @xmath18 and 1.80 and a fixed metallicity of @xmath196 .",
    "this metallicity choice is based on the luminosity - metallicity relationship in @xcite for @xmath197 galaxies .",
    "plotting these models in the color - h@xmath0 ew plane shows that all observed data points are covered by either imf .    to test whether the observed distribution of points in the @xmath162 bin can be explained by bursting sfhs the mc techniques of  5 were used .",
    "the models of  4 were replaced with the grid of single burst models .",
    "the 100 mc simulations were constructed as described earlier , but using only the 329 @xmath162 galaxies as a basis .",
    "the analysis yielded @xmath198 for @xmath111 and @xmath199 for @xmath200 , both of which are over fits .",
    "this shows than an individual galaxy can be fit with an arbitrary imf given the freedom to choose a sfh .",
    "however , our advantage is that we have _ many _ galaxies and the distribution of the properties of the best fit models can be shown to be implausible .",
    "figure [ fig : chibursts ] demonstrates the problem with the single burst model . on the left of the figure the distribution of the best fitting burst strengths are plotted as a fraction of the total stellar mass formed .",
    "at right is the distribution of the best fitting times from the burst onset .",
    "for example , a galaxy which best fits a model with a burst at 1.000 gyr at an age of 1.211 gyr has a time from burst onset of 211 myr .",
    "this measure is used because in an investigation of the effects of bursts the age relative to the burst is more important than the age given that the bursts occur at different , random times across the models .    for both @xmath111 and @xmath200 the number of objects best fit by a model prior to the burst",
    "is @xmath201 , or 3% , and are not plotted . in both cases the distributions of the best fitting ages and ages at which the burst begins are roughly uniform .",
    "given this fact it is expected that half of the galaxies should be best fit by a pre - burst model .",
    "furthermore the right hand panel shows sharp , significant discontinuities in the distribution of best fitting time from burst onset .",
    "again , viewed at random times this distribution should be uniform but is highly peaked in the 25 myr at the start of the burst and the 25 myr just after the burst ends . in both cases",
    "the errors bars show that the discontinuities are significant . in the case of @xmath111 , 3.5 times as many galaxies are in the 200 myr after the burst ends than the 200 myr during it and this 400 myr accounts for 57% of all galaxies .",
    "although our sample is @xmath86-band selected the stars in the 0.7 to 3 m@xmath25 range which dominate the red continuum in the red giant phase do not start to leave the main sequence for 300 myr .",
    "the sharp increase in galaxies fit at 200 myr after the burst can not be due to a selection effect . assuming a universal imf this points to a strong coordination of sfhs across a population of galaxies unrelated in space .",
    "these arguments show that while a single burst model can fit the data extremely well , it does not do so in a physically self - consistent fashion .      to find a physical motivation for sfh models for low luminosity galaxies we look towards the local group .",
    "there have been a number of recent studies of the sfhs of local dwarf galaxies which use hst to get color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) of resolved stellar populations .",
    "the sfh is determined by fitting isochrones to the cmd .",
    "the sample here is biased by local group membership and by what galaxies have been observed to date .",
    "the galaxies mentioned here give a point of reference rather than a well - defined distribution of sfhs .    the blue compact dwarf ( bcd )",
    "ugca 290 was found to quiescently form stars over the past gyr up until a ten - fold increase in sfr from 15 to 10 myr ago which more recently has decreased to a quarter of its peak value @xcite .",
    "the dwarf irregular ic 1613 , which is relatively isolated and non - interacting , was found to have sfr enhanced by a factor of 3 from 3 to 6 gyr ago without evidence of strong bursts @xcite .",
    "the dwarf irregular ngc 6822 , also relatively isolated , is found to have a roughly constant sfh @xcite .",
    "the bcd ngc 1705 is found to be _",
    "gasping_- a sfh marked by moderate activity punctuated by short periods of decreased star formation @xcite .",
    "the authors also note that ngc 1705 is best fit by an imf with @xmath202 .",
    "ngc 1569 likely experienced three strong bursts in the last gyr as well as a quiescent phase from 150 to 300 myr ago @xcite .",
    "inspired by the preceding local group sfhs we constructed six sfh classes with multiple bursts .",
    "these sfh classes are described in table [ tab : sfhs ] .",
    "each class starts with an underlying smooth sfh .",
    "sfhs # 1 & 2 have no star formation , # 3 & 4 have a constant sfh and # 5 & 6 have exponentially decreasing sfhs like those previously described .",
    "star formation discontinuities are then superimposed on top of the smooth sfhs .",
    "these discontinuities are in the form of increased ( bursts ) or decreased ( gasps ) star formation for periods of 200 myr .",
    "the time and spacing of the discontinuities is random with the mean interval between bursts listed in table [ tab : sfhs ] .    for each sfh class described above we randomly generated 1,000 sfhs .",
    "colors and ew widths were calculated for each sfh using @xmath111 and @xmath196 . according to the sdss mass - metallicity relationship @xcite galaxies at @xmath67 will on average have @xmath196 .",
    "we then repeated our @xmath118 analysis with the 100 mc simulations of the @xmath162 galaxies in the same manner as for the single burst models .",
    "the results of our analysis for each of the six sfh classes are shown in figure [ fig:6sfh ] .",
    "sfh 5 , the gasps on top of exponential sfhs , is the best fit with @xmath203 .",
    "extended periods of no star formation punctuated by bursts ( sfhs # 1 & 2 ) do not fit the data .    as was the case for the single burst models an unreasonable fraction of galaxies",
    "are best fit by sfhs in the 20 myr immediately following a burst or the first 20 myr of a gasp .",
    "if the sfh models are reasonable we should see roughly equal numbers of galaxies in each time bin .",
    "there is no reason why all of the low luminosity galaxies across the large volume of space in the sdss footprint should have experienced coordinated bursts .",
    "however each panel of figure [ fig:6sfh ] has at least 40% of the galaxies in one 20 myr bin .",
    "one explanation for this is that it is an artifact of our sample being selected in the @xmath86 band .",
    "however spectral synthesis models show that for instantaneous bursts of star formation the @xmath165 magnitude is brightest at the burst time and decays smoothly for a range of @xmath108 . if anything it is more likely to catch galaxies during a burst rather than after or after a gasp instead of during one .",
    "regardless of the sfh model the presence of blue galaxies with low h@xmath0 ew requires a recent discontinuity in the sfr for @xmath111 .",
    "based on the evolution of the @xmath165 band luminosity we expect to see a similar number of galaxies with excess h@xmath0 ews .",
    "the fact that these galaxies are missing shows that the discontinuous sfh models do not match our observations .",
    "therefore imf variations are a more likely explanation for the observed distribution of @xmath67 galaxies .      as a last exercise",
    "the best fitting sfh models from the previous section can be run forward to see if the correct imf can be recovered . for each sfh",
    "model grids 10,000 data points were chosen by selecting a random sfh and a _ uniformly distributed _ age .",
    "normal errors were added using the error characteristics of the @xmath67 bin .",
    "this synthetic data was analyzed in the same fashion as the real data in the earlier sections .",
    "for the single burst models the recovered imf models for @xmath204 and 1.80 were 1.34 and 1.79 respectively with best fitting @xmath205 0.80 and 0.65 .",
    "for sfh 5 the recovered imf was also @xmath206 with @xmath207 .",
    "in all three cases the correct imfs were recovered although the fit was worsened by by the burst activity .",
    "this reinforces the difficulty in producing enough blue , low h@xmath0 ew galaxies to match the observed data with simple sfh models .",
    "in the previous sections we have expanded on the k83 method and exploited the h@xmath0 and color information as much as possible . in the bias section we found that various possible biases do not fully explain either the increased values of @xmath108 or the poor fit to a single imf in the lowest luminosity bins . in the sfh section we found that an arbitrary @xmath108 value coupled with a plausible sfh with bursts or gasps can account for the position of any individual galaxy in the color - h@xmath0 ew plane . however taking the population of @xmath67 galaxies together necessitates an incredibly unlikely coordination of sfhs across the disparate group of objects .",
    "this points to the extraordinary conclusion that while the imf may be universal across luminous galaxies , it is not in fact universal in low luminosity galaxies .",
    "such an extraordinary claim would ideally be backed by extraordinary evidence . in this section",
    "we take a look beyond the k83 method for some reinforcement of our result .",
    "the h@xmath208 absorption feature can be used to gain additional insight into the nature of stellar populations .",
    "absorption is due to absorption lines form stellar photospheres .",
    "the balmer absorption lines are most prominent in a stars and weaken due to the saha equation for both hotter and cooler stars .",
    "as such the h@xmath208 absorption is a proxy for the fraction of light of a stellar population being supplied by a stars , and to a lesser extent b and f type stars . in a stellar population of a uniform age the h@xmath208 absorption will peak after the o and b stars burn out , but before the a stars leave the main sequence .",
    "for this reason the strength of h@xmath208 can be used help determine the age of a population or to detect bursts of star formation which occurred around 1 gyr in the past .",
    "@xcite describes two different methods for measuring h@xmath208 absorption .",
    "the h@xmath209 definition is tuned to most accurately measure the h@xmath208 absorption from f stars .",
    "the h@xmath29 definition has a wider central bandpass to match the line profiles of a stars .",
    "they state that the h@xmath29 definition is better to use for galaxies because it is less noisy in low s / n galaxies and velocity dispersion acts to widen absorption features . on the downside the narrower h@xmath209 definition is much more sensitive to population age where it can be used .",
    "@xcite observationally determines the range of h@xmath29 values to be from 13 for a4 dwarf stars to -9 for m - type giant stars .",
    "h@xmath29 values can be measured from the sdss spectra . like",
    "the h@xmath0 ew values our h@xmath29 values come from @xcite instead of the sdss pipeline .",
    "figure [ fig : hdfig ] compares the distribution of the h@xmath29 values for the @xmath67 and @xmath180 luminosity bins . for reference recall that figure [ fig : hagr1723 ] plots the color and h@xmath0 ews for these two bins .",
    "the difference between the high and low luminosity bins is clear .",
    "gaussian profiles can be fit to both distributions . for the @xmath180 bin",
    "the standard deviation of the profile is twice as large as the measurement error in h@xmath29 suggesting that the true distribution has a range of values .",
    "assuming both the errors and underlying distribution are gaussian the distribution of h@xmath29 for the luminous galaxies is centered at h@xmath210 with a standard deviation of 1.5 . by contrast , the gaussian fit to the @xmath67 bin has the same standard deviation as the median error in the galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with nearly all of the galaxies having h@xmath211 .",
    "this shows that the fainter galaxies on average have significantly larger fractions of a - type stars amongst their stellar populations .",
    "it also shows a seemingly unlikely coordination of h@xmath29 in the low luminosity galaxies , reminiscent of the earlier suggestion of coordinated sfhs .",
    "the question then becomes why ?    for a possible explanation we look again to the models .",
    "modeling the behavior of h@xmath29 requires an extra step .",
    "the standard pegase.2 models do not have the required resolution to accurately measure the h@xmath29 index .",
    "this is remedied with the use of the pegase - hr code @xcite which uses a library of echelle spectra of 1503 stars to calculate spectral synthesis models with r=10,000 over the range of 4000 to 6800 .",
    "using pegase - hr in the low resolution mode yields the same results as pegase.2 , and the same input parameters are used for both codes .",
    "the models here are the same as those described earlier in the models section , but have been recalculated using pegase - hr to allow h@xmath29 measurements .",
    "figure [ fig : hdmodplot ] shows the behavior of the h@xmath29 index as a function of age for four different imf models , @xmath142 , 1.40 , 1.70 and 2.00 . for each",
    "imf models of all metallicities and smooth sfhs are plotted for each age .",
    "the qualitative behavior of all models is the same .",
    "the h@xmath29 holds steady for the first 20 to 40 myr before increasing to a peak value at 700 myr to 1 gyr and then falls off .",
    "prior to reaching the peak value for each imf the metallicity has the strongest effect on the h@xmath29 index .",
    "at this point the lowest metallicity galaxies have the highest h@xmath29 .",
    "after the peak the sfh has the strongest effect with the constant and increasing sfhs maintaining higher h@xmath212 values .",
    "after a few gyr the differences in h@xmath29 between models with different imfs disappear . prior to that",
    "there are three main differences .",
    "first , the peak h@xmath29 values are higher for larger values of @xmath108 . for @xmath145 h@xmath29",
    "reaches a maximum value of nearly 8 and the maximum value is similar for all metallicities . for @xmath142",
    "the maximum value ranges from 4.5 to 6 depending on the metallicity .",
    "this is due to the fact that the steeper imfs have fewer luminous massive stars to dilute the h@xmath208 absorption features from the a star population .",
    "secondly , the low @xmath108 models have h@xmath29 values that start their initial increases at a later time .",
    "lastly the low @xmath108 models reach their peak values later in time than those with fewer massive stars .    to compare the h@xmath29 values for the @xmath180 and @xmath213 bins to the models the range of the middle 90% values from figure [ fig : hdfig ] for each bin",
    "are overlaid on figure [ fig : hdmodplot ] .",
    "once again the @xmath180 bin is in good agreement with our assumption of a universal imf and smooth sfh .",
    "the range of h@xmath29 values can be accomplished with a single salpeter - like @xmath214 imf with only the proviso that most galaxies be older than a few gyr or younger than 300 myr .",
    "however the exact same statement can be made for @xmath215 so h@xmath29 provides only a constraint on the age of the most luminous galaxies , but not the imf .    for the @xmath67 galaxies the distribution of h@xmath29 can not be achieved with the shallowest imfs investigated under the assumption of smooth sfhs .",
    "however salpeter and steeper imfs can be accomplished .",
    "what changes is the range of ages over which the models have the correct h@xmath29 .",
    "steeper imfs require that the galaxies be either older than a few gyr or 200 myr old to accommodate the observed h@xmath29 values .",
    "most troubling is that there does not appear to be any reason why h@xmath29 should stack up at 6.1 for the @xmath67 galaxies .",
    "h@xmath29 values can also be calculated for the same sfh class models used earlier .",
    "unfortunately this does not provide any added constraints .",
    "values remain elevated for several 100 myr after the start of a burst or the end of a gasp of sfh .",
    "the behavior of h@xmath29 in the presence of sfh discontinuities provides no need for galaxies to stack up in the narrow 20 myr intervals seen in the earlier multiple burst section , nor do these models suggest why the low luminosity galaxies are consistent with a single value of h@xmath29 .",
    "there is no satisfactory model to account for the h@xmath29 distribution of the low luminosity galaxies .",
    "however the sfh results from the previous section strongly suggest that the incredible coordination of discontinuities is highly unlikely .",
    "steeper imfs do allow for higher h@xmath29 values for longer periods of time , thus relaxing the sfh coordination requirement .",
    "this agrees with our earlier results for faint galaxies .",
    "the low luminosity galaxies are most likely the result of a mix of imfs which are on average steeper than salpeter .",
    "the goal of this paper was to revisit the k83 method for inferring the imf from integrated stellar populations and to harness the richness of the sdss data , improved spectral synthesis models and greater computational power available today to make a state - of - the - art measurement of the imf .",
    "the quality of the sdss spectroscopy allowed us to address several of the limitations of k83 and ktc94 we resolve the [ ] lines ( a significant improvement in the accuracy of the h@xmath0 ews of individual galaxies ) , eliminate contamination from agn , make extinction corrections for individual galaxies and fit underlying stellar absorption of h@xmath0 .",
    "we succeeded in achieving more accurate ews for individual galaxies .",
    "the median total ew error for our sample is 17% compared to a 10% uncertainty in ews combined with a 20 - 30% uncertainty in the extinction correction for k83 .",
    "we expanded the grid of models to allow for a range of ages and metallicities .",
    "we used @xmath118 minimization to go beyond differentiating between two or three imf models to actual fitting for the best imf slope .",
    "the vast size of the sdss sample allowed us to both drive down random errors and to cut the data into narrow parameter ranges which were still statistically viable .",
    "the size of the dr4 sample yielded @xmath216 95% confidence region due to random error for the sample as a whole .",
    "even the volume limited @xmath67 luminosity bin with only 329 objects has a random error of @xmath217 . only in bins with fewer than 10 objects",
    "do the random errors become significant .",
    "our imf fitting is therefore dominated by systematics .",
    "originally we believed that our systematics would be dominated by the effects of sfh discontinuities .",
    "however we conducted several experiments where we selected populations of galaxies from models with bursting or gasping sfhs and gave them measurement errors consistent with those in the @xmath162 luminosity bin . to our surprise",
    "our @xmath118 minimization revealed the true imfs with @xmath218 .",
    "the main effect was to reduce the quality of the fits .",
    "this is due to the fact that h@xmath0 ews return to nominal levels in a relatively short time after sfh discontinuities .    another way to estimate",
    "the size of the systematic errors is to look at the trends of the @xmath219 and @xmath160 luminosity bins , because they have the largest membership , in figures [ fig : redshift ] , [ fig : aperture ] and [ fig : extinction ] . assuming that the imf is universal and that our method is perfect we should get the same answer for any subset of the data we might choose .",
    "the largest ranges are @xmath220 for redshift binning , @xmath221 by aperture and @xmath221 by extinction .",
    "conservatively then the systematic error is @xmath4 .",
    "there are two points to be kept in mind about this estimate of the systematic error . for one",
    "it is the systematic error in the exact value of @xmath108 . even in figure",
    "[ fig : avap ] where more narrow bands of measured extinction and aperture fraction are considered the same trends with luminosity are seen as with the sample as a whole .",
    "the relative systematics between luminosity bins in these narrow slices is much smaller .",
    "the second thing to remember is the way in which we empirically defined our systematic error discounts the possibility of imf variations .",
    "what we have called systematics could actually be science .",
    "if galaxies have radial imf gradients or if dust content plays a strong role in star formation the systematic error could be much smaller .",
    "the main area in which we were unable to improve upon the k83 and ktc94 studies is that they were able to match the aperture size to the galaxies which avoids the issue of aperture effects .",
    "first , for galaxies brighter than @xmath222 the best fitting imfs are salpeter - like ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "in addition the assumption of a universal imf and smoothly varying sfhs is a good fit .",
    "this is reassuring as it follows the conventional wisdom and provides confidence that the method works .",
    "secondly , galaxies fainter than @xmath222 are best fit by steeper imfs with larger fractions of low mass stars . for these galaxies a universal imf and",
    "smooth sfh is a poor assumption .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with evidence that lsbs have bottom - heavy imfs @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning the main caveat of our @xmath108 values again .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : oddimf ] imf parameterizations are themselves degenerate in our parameter space . increasing the imf slope has a similar effect to lowering the highest mass stars that are formed or increasing the fraction of intermediate mass stars .",
    "this method can not explicitly determine if two populations have the same underlying imf .",
    "figure [ fig : all - like ] shows that for the sample as a whole the @xcite three part power law yields nearly the same result as our two part power law .",
    "however our method is sensitive in many cases if the imfs are different .    in terms of star",
    "forming cloud temperatures the harsher ambient radiation and larger number of sources of cosmic rays present in more luminous galaxies agree qualitatively with our results . with the extra energy hitting the star forming clouds",
    "larger masses may be needed for contraction and fractionization may end sooner , suppressing the formation of less massive stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that while the regions of the luminous grand design spiral ngc 5457 ( m 31 ) can be reproduced by a single salpeter imf , for the low luminosity flocculent galaxy ngc 4395 a blend of two imfs is required .",
    "however , such trends are not seen in studies of well - resolved stellar populations @xcite .",
    "another explanation for the absence of massive stars is that the massive stars are there , but are not visible .",
    "extinction to the center of star forming regions , where massive stars preferentially exist , can reach @xmath223 @xcite .",
    "however the low luminosity galaxies have the lowest observed extinctions ( see table [ tab : lumbins ] ) which is the opposite of what would be expected given our imf results .",
    "it is also possible that the imf is in fact universal , but the way in which it is sampled in embedded star clusters leads to an integrated galaxial imf which varies from the true imf .",
    "@xcite use a universal imf with the assumption that stars are born in clusters where the maximum cluster mass is related to the star formation rate . for a range of models",
    "this leads to a narrow range for the apparent imf in high mass galaxies . for low mass galaxies",
    "the imf is steeper with a wider range of slopes .",
    "the results here are in qualitative agreement for some of the integrated galactic imf scenarios in @xcite given that there should be a rough correlation between galaxy luminosity and mass .",
    "once again , @xcite argues that the galaxy wide imf should be the same as the imf in clusters regardless .    in light of the theory of @xcite , whether the results of this paper speak to a relationship between environment and the formation of individual stars is open to interpretation .",
    "however the impact on the modeling and interpretation of the properties of galaxies is clear .",
    "@xcite note that the integrated galaxial imf is the correct imf to use when studying global properties of galaxies .",
    "even if the imf of stars is in truth universal it may currently be misused in the modeling of galaxies .",
    "furthermore a varying integrated galaxial imf could open the door to new insights in galaxy evolution .",
    "for instance , @xcite suggest that the observed mass - metallicity relationship in galaxies naturally arises from a variable integrated galaxial imf similar to the results of this paper",
    ".    future work will expand in several directions .",
    "the success constraining the imf with only two observed parameters ( albeit carefully chosen to be orthogonal to systematic errors ) motivates a more expansive analysis with more parameters .",
    "information from wavelength regimes beyond the sdss can be used .",
    "for instance the absorption strength and p - cygni profile shape of the @xmath224 line due to massive stars is sensitive to the imf slope and upper mass cutoff @xcite .",
    "however it could be contaminated by absorption from the interstellar medium and would need to be disentangled @xcite .",
    "a full markov chain monte carlo analysis could be implemented fitting to multiple spectral features and marginalizing over a range of sfhs .",
    "in addition to luminosity , surface brightness and gas phase metallicity can be tested for systematic imf variations .",
    "while the results for luminous galaxies are already dominated by systematics , the continued progress of the sdss can provide better statistics for a more detailed analysis of what physical processes are behind the imf variations in faint galaxies .",

    "<S> this paper revisits the classical kennicutt method for inferring the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) from the integrated light properties of galaxies . the large size </S>",
    "<S> , uniform high quality data set from the sloan digital sky survey dr4 is combined with more in depth modeling and quantitative statistical analysis to search for systematic imf variations as a function of galaxy luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> galaxy h@xmath0 equivalent widths are compared to a broadband color index to constrain the imf . </S>",
    "<S> this parameter space is useful for breaking degeneracies which are traditionally problematic . </S>",
    "<S> age and dust corrections are largely orthogonal to imf variations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition the effects of metallicity and smooth star formation history e - folding times are small compared to imf variations . we find that for the sample as a whole the best fitting imf slope above 0.5 @xmath1 is @xmath2 with a negligible random error of @xmath3 and a systematic error of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies brighter than around @xmath5 ( including galaxies like the milky way which has @xmath6 ) are well fit by a universal @xmath7 imf , similar to salpeter , and smooth , exponential star formation histories ( sfh ) . </S>",
    "<S> fainter galaxies prefer steeper imfs and the quality of the fits reveal that for these galaxies a universal imf with smooth sfhs is actually a poor assumption . </S>",
    "<S> several sources of sample bias are ruled out as the cause of these luminosity dependent imf variations . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of bursting sfh models shows that an implausible coordination of burst times is required to fit a universal imf to the @xmath8 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the conclusions that the imf in low luminosity galaxies has fewer massive stars , either by steeper slope or lower upper mass cutoff , and is not universal . </S>"
