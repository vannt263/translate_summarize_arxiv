    "to identify the nature of dark matter ( dm ) particles , three different experimental strategies have been devised .",
    "first , high - energy colliders like the large hadron collider at cern @xcite may soon be able to produce dm particles , and possibly identify them ( see e.g. refs . @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "another possibility is _ direct detection _ , based on the search for rare events in which a dm particle scatters off the nuclei of large detectors ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . finally , _",
    "indirect detection _ is based on the search for the products of annihilation or decay of dm particles ( such as photons , neutrinos and anti - protons ) .",
    "many candidates have been proposed for dm , but the most studied ones belong to the class of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) @xcite , that includes , among others , the lightest neutralino in minimal or non - minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model @xcite , and the lightest kaluka - klein state in models with unified extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "here we focus on indirect dm searches .",
    "ideal targets for indirect dm searches are nearby , high dm density regions , such as local celestial bodies like the earth and the sun , where dm can be captured , or centers of galactic halos ( see e.g. refs .",
    "two classes of astrophysical objects of particular interest are supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) @xcite , with masses from @xmath0 to @xmath1 and the more speculative intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) , with a mass from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ( see e.g. refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "both these classes of compact objects can influence the distribution of dm in which they are embedded , leading to strong overdensities : we review here the impact of the formation and growth of bhs on the surrounding distribution of matter , and the consequences for indirect dm searches .",
    "being the annihilation flux proportional to the integral of the dm density squared , scenarios where the density is _ boosted _ by the presence , or the growth , of a central bh , are very promising for indirect searches .",
    "bhs can thus be considered as _",
    "dm annihilation boosters_.    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : two ] we discuss our current understanding of dm profiles in halos without central bhs . in section",
    "[ sec : three ] we address the case of a dm distributon evolving around an already - formed bh . in section [ sec : four ] , we discuss the case of adiabatic growth and the conditions under which dm `` spikes '' can form . in section [ sec : five ] we will focus on imbhs , and show that some of the problems associated to the formation of spikes around smbhs can be evaded , with important consequences for indirect dm searches .",
    "conclusions will be drawn in section vi .",
    "there is strong evidence in favor of the presence of smbhs at the center of every galaxy with a substantial bulge component @xcite and it has been suggested that even globular clusters can harbor imbhs @xcite . throughout the paper , we will generically refer to large gravitationally bound systems like globular clusters , galaxies and clusters of galaxies , as _ galaxies _ , and we will refer to their central region as the _ nucleus _ , which may host bhs .",
    "such compact objects account roughly for @xmath4 of the baryonic mass of the galaxy , which is composed of stars , intergalactic dust and dm .",
    "we focus on a generic wimp scenario , with an annihilation cross section of order @xmath5 and a mass ranging between the gev and the tev scale .",
    "since we want to characterize how bhs influence the surrounding distribution of matter , we need to specify how dm is distributed _ before _ the bhs form , and use this information as initial condition for the problem at hand .",
    "profiles without any central object also receive particular attention _ per se _ , since the cuspiness of a dm halo without bh can give informations about the `` coldness '' of the dm candidate @xcite .",
    "recently , @xmath6-body simulations of galaxies found results in favor of power law profiles ( with slope from @xmath7 to @xmath8 ) for the nuclear region , emphasizing the contrast with direct observations , such as rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbs ) @xcite and x - ray imaging , which suggest instead the presence of flat dm cores .",

    "however , the logarithmic slope @xmath13 of the density profile decreases faster ( more slowly ) in the simulated data than does in the nfw ( m99 ) profile at small radii . moreover",
    ", @xmath6-body simulations do not exhibit any indications that @xmath14 converges to a central value @xmath15 , as should happen for a nfw profile ( @xmath16 ) or for a m99 profile ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this can be due to the finite resolution of numerical simulations , which can be trusted down to the resolution radius @xmath18 , usually taken to be around 0.5% of the virial radius , depending on the total number of particles in the simulation ( @xmath19 , for milky way - sized halos ) .",

    "the nfw is recovered for @xmath25 and the m99 for @xmath26 .",
    "it has been proposed that , for a choice of parameters mimicking the presence of flat cores ( e.g. if @xmath27 ) , such profiles provide good fits of both the rotation curves from direct observation of lsb galaxies and of the rotation curves from simulated nuclei , suggesting that core profiles should be preferred to eqs .",

    "@xcite is the fact that the analysis by navarro _ et al . _",
    "does not take into account the large uncertainty in the determination of the luminosity distance of galaxies .",
    "moreover , it was recently shown @xcite that the best fit to simulated data for high - resolution @xmath28cdm halos is obtained with profiles inspired from the so - called srsic law @xcite : @xmath29    such a relation provides the best description of the luminosity profiles of elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disk galaxies @xcite : @xmath30 is the projected density , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the projected radius .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 , called srsic index , defines the shape of the profile , and @xmath34 is a function of @xmath33 , usually chosen so that the radius @xmath35 contains half of the luminosity of the galaxy .",

    "a number of recent studies @xcite have confirmed that simulated dm density profiles deviate slightly but systematically from the nfw form and are better approximated by einasto s empirical law .",

    "the `` mass deficit '' ( compared to what one expects from the srsic law @xcite ) is up to 4 times the mass of the central bh .",

    "[ eqn : fokker_planck ] relies on the following assumptions :    * stars are point - like masses , described by a distribution function that evolves due to gravitational interactions with the central bh and among themselves .",
    "in particular , this means that encounters in which stars collide with each other are neglected * the small - angle approximation : the gravitational potential belongs to a particular class of interactions for which the net force experienced by a test particle surrounded by a population of other bodies with which it interacts , is mainly due to cumulative , weak encounters with particles far away , rather than to strong but infrequent interactions with close particles .",
    "if we call @xmath82 the impact parameter for the interaction that causes a deflection of @xmath83 in the velocity of the test particle , all the close encounters with impact parameters @xmath84 count only for 4% of the total net deflection @xcite .",
    "working under the small - angle approximation means that , in the study of the evolution of a test particle with a velocity * v * embedded in a larger particle population , we are considering only the encounters with those bodies far away that will produce small deflections @xmath85 compared to the initial velocity * v * * the distribution function does not depends on the angular momentum and , since the gravitational potential is function only of the radial coordinate , the stellar distribution is isotropic * the mass of the central bh is much larger than the mass of a star and does not change with time , so that inside the influence radius , the gravitational potential is constant and keplerian and is due only to the bh itself . under this assumption",
    "we can ( as in eq .",
    "[ eqn : fokker_planck ] ) neglect the term proportional to @xmath86 that would appear in a more complete form of the fokker - planck equation .",
    "moreover the bh mass has to be much smaller than the total stellar mass near the bh itself .",
    "requiring this particular mass hierarchy @xcite , leads us to a consequent timescale hierarchy , i.e. , the assumption @xmath87 implies that the crossing time @xmath88 ( the time needed for a star to cross the nucleus ) is much shorter than the relaxation time , so that in a crossing time stars do not experience any changes in the physical proprieties of the system .",
    "all the assumptions listed above can also be satisfied in the case of a distribution of dm particles only ( with a common mass @xmath89 ) , so that a fokker - planck formalism is appropriate also for dm .",
    "we expect the existence of a relaxed solution also in this case , but the relaxation timescale for dm is enormously larger than for stars and dm particles will never reach their steady - state solution : they can be effectively considered as collisionless objects , pratically not sensitive to the gravitational self - interactions that drive the dynamical evolution described by the fokker - planck equation .",
    "the requirement of a common mass for particles ( stars or dm ) is not included in the list above , because in the more realistic case of a nucleus with particles of different mass , eq . [ eqn : fokker_planck ] can be modified in order to describe a multi - mass case .",
    "for a two - component nucleus , made of stars ( with a common mass @xmath44 ) and dm particles with @xmath90 the fokker - planck equations will be the following : @xmath91    @xmath92    with @xmath93    @xmath94    with @xmath95 $ ] , and the diffusion coefficents can be written as @xmath96,\\ ] ] @xmath97    @xmath98 is the stellar distribution function , whose evolution ( eq .",

    "the final steady - state solutions will have the usual @xmath100 slope for stars ( in fact eq .",

    "[ eqn : fokker_planck ] ) and a milder @xmath101 slope for dm , that will be established in the same timescale @xmath43 ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : relaxation ] ) .",
    "the steeping of the initial profile , due to the presence of a bh , leads to an increase of the dm annihilation rate .",
    "this is why we refer to bhs as _ dm annihilation boosters_. although in this case the effect is not dramatic , since a @xmath102 profile can be found even for models without bhs ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : two ] ) , and it is more likely that the overdensity will be reduced in a couple of relaxation times @xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : crest ] ) , we will see cases in the next sections where bhs can provide huge boost factors .    the presence of a stellar cusp has been experimentally confirmed for the mw @xcite , through the detection of a profile with a slope equal to @xmath103 in the inner region ( @xmath104 ) and to @xmath40 ( isothermal profile ) in the outer region ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . our galaxy is a collisional nucleus , since the relaxation time is shorter than the age of the universe ( @xmath105 at @xmath61 ) , so it was suggested to interpret its cusp as the bahcall - wolf solution to the presence of a smbh with a mass @xmath106 ( @xmath51 is @xmath107 pc so that the cusp starts more or less where @xmath108 ) , hypothesis supported also by the luminosity of the x - ray source sgr a@xmath109 .",
    "anyway , it is more likely that the mw experienced a merger between a redshift @xmath110 @xcite and today , so the cusp will be the result of an `` overdensity regeneration '' ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : crest ] ) .",
    "the actual , detected profile @xcite is consistent with a cusp regenerated after a merger occured at a time @xmath111 gyr in the past .",
    "the detected inner slope of @xmath112 is not exactly what the bahcall - wolf solution predicts ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "however , the two results are considered consistent with each other since the steeper value is derived under the simplyfing assumption of a population of stars with identical mass , and if the more realistic multi - mass formalism is introduced , the slope will become shallower , moving towards the @xmath112 value .",
    "the same can be said if , as it was argued @xcite , the time required to reach a steady - state solution at the galactic center is @xmath114 .    .",

    "first of all , we review the basics of _ loss - cone _ dynamics , i.e. the effects related to the presence of a bh tidal radius or of the relativistic event horizon .",
    "this is only partially relevant for dm since it will affect mainly the stellar population , but it is relevant in this contest since we have just seen ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : dm ] ) how stars and dm evolve together , so that a decrease in the stellar cusp due to loss - cone @xcite will influence the dm density , too",
    ". moreover we want to emphasize that any enhancement in the density of dm and stars has to survive to a collection of dynamical mechanisms that can damp them .    after discussing the loss - cone",
    ", we will focus on the possibility that , during the merging evolution of a nucleus , a bh binary forms . in this case",
    ", both stellar and dm distributions will be directly affected @xcite , leading not only to the reduction of cusps but also to the possible destruction of spikes in models with adiabatic growth @xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : spike_destruction ] ) .",
    "the loss - cone of a bh is the set of eccentric orbits populated by stars that are going to intersect the tidal radius .",
    "such orbits are depleted in a crossing time @xmath88 , since stars are eaten up by the bh : tidal forces inside the tidal radius tear a star apart and these events are accompanied by flares , emissions of light peaked in the x or uv band with a luminosity of @xmath116 . a handful of these flares",
    "have been observed : they have the expected signature and the number of detections is roughly consistent with theoretical estimates of the consumption rate @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "once depleted , loss - cone orbits can continue to contribute to the consumption rate only if they are somehow refilled with particles .",
    "energy diffusion provides a mechanism for such a repopulation .",
    "in fact , @xmath6-body simulations confirmed @xcite that the zero - flux bahcall - wolf solution is established only approximately and that ( for stars ) there is a residual flux @xmath118 .",
    "this value is too low compared to the expected @xmath117 whose main contribution comes , instead , from angular momentum diffusion : the `` classic loss - cone theory '' @xcite applies to globular clusters ( populated with a central bh ) , whose relaxation time is so low that they are well - relaxed and old objects .",
    "the distribution of stars near the bh is therefore assumed to be on a steady - state , for which a fokker - planck - like formalism is appropriate .",
    "resulting estimates for the consumption flux can be introduced in the original fokker - planck equation ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : fokker_planck ] ) to study how particle density is affected by the presence of a tidal radius : @xmath119    when extended to the study of galactic nuclei , the steady - state approximation may fail , at least for collisionless nuclei , and the stellar profile near the tidal radius is , in general , different from the bahcall - wolf one . for example , galaxies are only approximately spherical : their shape is more likely to be triaxial and there is the possibility that they are governed by centrophillic orbits , i.e. orbits that pass arbitrarily close to the bh . in the case",
    "that these chaotic orbits survive until late stages in the galactic evolution , @xmath117 would increase , since more particles would fall into the tidal sphere .    alternatively , the present galaxy can be the result of cumulative mergers of less massive mini - galaxies , each of them hosting a mini - bh : the formation of a bh binary would decrease the consumption rate , since all stars with angular momentum @xmath120 would be ejected @xcite ( @xmath121 is the total mass of the binary and @xmath122 the major semi - axis when the system becomes `` hard '' ) , preventing loss - cone repopulation and leading to lower rates @xmath117 .    finally , in real galaxies , the diffuse mechanism of orbits refillment will cause the nucleus to expand @xcite @xcite , since the density is reduced when particles are eaten up and those particles which fall into the loss - cone transfer energy to the remaining nucleus with the same effect of a heating process .",
    "the expansion is visible in one single relaxation time , the `` decay '' goes on at a constant velocity and the density can be written as @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the initial profile , while @xmath125 . as a consequence ,",
    "present - day collisional nuclei could have been denser in the past .",
    "it has been suggested that also the presence of a bh binary can effectively reduce the bahcall - wolf cusp .",
    "the growth of a galaxy is thought to pass through the agglomeration of smaller galaxies and protogalactic fragments .",
    "if more than one of these subhalos contain a bh , the two objects will form a binary system whose dynamics can strongly affect stars and dm .",
    "this scenario has received great attention since mergers and the ultimate coalescence of the bh binary are ideal targets for the detection of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "evidences for the presence of such binaries can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and are based on the detection of multiple active nuclei in the same galaxy @xcite .",
    "consider a compact object with mass @xmath126 moving , with its nucleus , around a bh with mass @xmath127 , being @xmath128 the mass ratio and @xmath121 the total mass .",
    "the evolution of the binary can be described by three different phases @xcite : first , the smaller bh decays due to the dynamical friction with stars of the other nucleus , and the separation @xmath129 between the two objects drops down .",
    "when the influence radius @xmath51 of the more massive bh is reached , the two objects can be considered as a bound object and the first phase comes to an end .",
    "the infall time scale @xcite suggests that binaries are not so uncommon since , for reasonable values of @xmath130 ( @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) , they are able to form before the hubble time",
    ".    the second phase is characterized by a quick `` shrinking '' of the binary , until it becomes _ hard _ , i.e. the binding energy equals the kinetic energy , or equivalently the major semi - axis reaches @xcite @xmath133 .",
    "the third phase , when @xmath134 , is the least known : a binary in a fixed background begins to harden at a constant hardening rate @xmath135 , but physical binaries has already ejected almost all stars on intersecting orbits and the rate suddendly drops .",
    "these orbits need to be repopulated , usually by energy diffusion , but this effect is more likely to be only subdominant , at least in those bright galaxies where the scouring of bh binaries has been detected , characterized by a relaxation time higher than the hubble time . in numerical simulations with finite @xmath6 , gravitational encounters will unphysically continue to supply particles to the binary at rates roughly proportional to @xmath6 , so experimentally it is more usefull to define the semi - major axis @xmath136 where the hardening rate goes to zero @xcite . from @xmath6-body simulations it results",
    "@xmath137    @xmath138 is a second influence radius , defined as the radius where the total mass of particles within @xmath138 after the binary has stalled is equal to twice @xmath121 . this values for @xmath136",
    "is a couple of orders of magnitude higher than the distance where the binary coalescences .",
    "this is known as the `` final parsec problem '' , since evidence is strong that bhs binaries do efficiently coalescence @xcite at last .",
    "many solutions have been proposed @xcite , e.g. that , as for loss - cone orbits , the presence of centrophillic orbits in realistic triaxial galaxies can affect the above considerations , so that the binary continues to shrink even to @xmath134 .",
    "assuming that the binary does stall at @xmath136 , it will have transferred an energy @xmath139 to the particles in the nucleus .",
    "this relation has been used to explain the mass deficit in the core of brightest galaxies since such an energy release will let stars leave the central core , with a total displacement of mass @xmath140 and @xmath141 @xcite for @xmath142 .",
    "strictly speaking , the observed mass deficits @xmath140 reach values that are even four times larger than the mass of the binary @xmath121 ( that , if the coalescence occurs , is also the mass of the final bh ) .",
    "we can account for values as large as @xmath143 if the nucleus experiences more than one merger , with more than one binary forming . the total mass displaced will be simply the sum of each @xmath140 during each single merger .",
    "for even larger values , other mechanisms have to be evoked , e.g. the possibility that a third bh arrives when the first two have not coalescenced yet .",
    "in such a situation , one of the bh usually leaves the nucleus ( _ gravitational slingshot _",
    "effect ) leading to higher values for @xmath140 .",
    "similarly one of the smbh of a bh binary can be expelled with a high velocity , due to the so - called _ gravitational - wave rocket _ effect @xcite .",
    "in this section we relax the assumption of time - independent gravitational potential .",

    "in fact , cold orbits are those which provide the particles that will form the spike , since they are the most affected by the presence of the central bh .",
    "but these cold orbits are more likely to be depleted due to the interactions of stars with molecular clouds or globular clusters or other bodies that can pass through a galactic nucleus .",
    "moreover , the evolution of a galactic nucleus is thought to be characterized by the cumulative mergers of sub - nuclei and even a single merger event can have dramatic consequences on the distribution of cold orbits . in other words",

    "also in the case that the spike is formed , it is unlikely that it will survive to the evolution of the nucleus and , in particular to the presence of dynamical mechanisms that would provide an additional heating source to particles on cold orbits , with the result of highly reduce of even destroy the enhancement .",

    "we focus on imbhs first .",
    "their masses range from @xmath185 to @xmath3 and adiabatic growth leads to the formation of `` mini - spikes '' in the same way as with smbhs .",
    "we do nt have direct observational evidence for the existence of imbhs , but some hints come , e.g. , from ultra luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) @xcite , sources that emit in the x band with a luminosity higher than @xmath186 , and , hence , not compatible with the interpretation as bhs accreting at the eddington limit .",
    "but , due to their positions in the host galaxy , they can not be explained in terms of agns either .",
    "the hypothesis of a bh with a mass higher than @xmath187 and less massive than a smbh seems to be a fair explanation , instead .",
    "many authors also proposed that globular clusters can host imbhs , and a possible confirmation of this hypothesis comes from the fact that the mass scale for an imbh and the value of the stellar velocity dispersion measured in globular clusters fall exactly at the extrapolation at lower values of the @xmath56 relation valid for smbhs @xcite . from a theoretical point of view , imbhs can also help to explain the formation of smbhs : the sloan digital survey @xcite @xcite has detected quasars up to redshift @xmath188 suggesting that smbhs were already present when the universe was @xmath184 1 gyr old .",
    "one of the most natural way to understand this is that smbhs grew , through a phase of fast accretion and mergers , starting from already massive seeds .",
    "in fact , a generic prediction of scenarios that seek to explain the properties of the observed smbh population , is that a large number of `` wandering '' imbhs exist in dm halos @xcite @xcite .    despite their theoretical interest",
    ", it is difficult to obtain conclusive evidence for the existence of imbhs .",
    "a viable detection strategy could be the search for gravitational waves produced in the mergers of the imbhs population @xcite , with space - based interferometers such as the large interferometric space antenna lisa @xcite .",
    "two formation scenarios are discussed here , follwing ref .",
    "@xcite . in the first ( scenario",
    "a ) , imbhs form from the gravitational collapse of population iii stars , which are usually heavier than local stars , since they grow in an environment with very low metallicity , for which metal line cooling can be neglected . as a consequence , the jeans mass ( that scales with the temperature as @xmath189 ) is higher , allowing the formation of more massive structures .",
    "such stars are characterized by very low metallicity , too , meaning that they will lose little of their mass due to winds and weak pulsations .",
    "population iii stars with masses above larger than @xmath190 would be able to collapse directly to bhs without any explosion @xcite .    in the second scenario ( scenario b ) , the formation starts at high redshift ( @xmath191 ) from a gas cloud that is massive enough to cool down forming a protogalactic pressure - supported disc at the center of the cloud , made mainly by stars that , according to the distribution of angular momentum in the cloud , are in the low momentum tail of the distribution .",
    "the dynamics of the disc is governed by an effective viscosity that transfers matter at the center and angular momentum outward .",
    "this flow will go on until the first stars start to fragment in the outer region of the disc : the so - formed central object will undergo gravitational collapse , forming the final bh , with a mass scale of @xmath192 ( corresponding to an initial cloud with virial mass @xmath193 ) or @xcite    @xmath194    where @xmath64 is the fraction of the total baryonic mass in the gas cloud that has cooled into the disc",
    ", @xmath195 is that fraction of the baryonic mass of the disc that forms the final bh , @xmath196 is the halo virial mass , @xmath197 is the redshift when the formation starts from the cloud and @xmath198 the timescale for the evolution of the first generation of stars .",
    "regardless of the particular formation scenario , a population of imbhs is predicted , each of them surrounded by a mini - dm halo and a mini - spike .",
    "these mini - halos evolve , merge with each other and form the actual big halos of galaxies .",
    "the hosted imbhs will merge too , possibly contributing to the formation of the central smbh . however",
    "a fraction of initial mini - halos never experiences any mergers and the associated dm overdensity can survive till today .    moreover , at least for scenario b , imbhs form exactly at the center of the baryonic distribution in the mini - halos , forbidding bh off - center formation . strictly speaking , in order to avoid off - center formation",
    ", one should require that the pristine bh forms at the center of the dm distribution and this does not necessarily coincide with the center of baryons , since stars , been collisional , can experience a different evolution than the collissionless dm , resulting in a net displacement between the two distributions .",
    "but mini - halos are supposed to have a very low baryonic content , with no violent interactions able to drive the two distributions away one from the other : the fact that mini - halos are made most entirely by dm solves the possible off - center formation and , at the same time , the problem related to stars - dm interactions .",
    "scenario b is thus able to circumvent all the mechanisms for spike destruction described above , while in scenario a they are reduced but still efficient : in the following sections , we are going to consider scenario a as a conservative model for imbhs , instead of the more optimistic scenario b.    for the mw , an imbhs population of @xmath199 objects is predicted by the numerical simulations in ref .",
