    "babar s discovery of the @xmath0 state@xcite generated strong interest in heavy meson spectroscopy , chiefly due to its surprisingly low mass with respect to expectations .",
    "these expectations are based on quark models or lattice gauge theory .",
    "unfortunately , at present large lattice systematic errors do not allow a determination of the @xmath4 mass with a precision better than several hundred mev . and ,",
    "although quark models appear to be exceptionally accurate in describing charmonia , they are less constrained by experiment and on a weaker theoretical footing in the open charm sector .",
    "it is therefore imperative to examine reasonable alternative descriptions of the open charm sector .",
    "the @xmath0 was produced in @xmath5 scattering and discovered in the isospin violating @xmath6 decay mode in @xmath7 and @xmath8 mass distributions .",
    "its width is less than 10 mev and it is likely that the quantum numbers are @xmath9@xcite .",
    "finally , if the @xmath10 mode dominates the width of the @xmath0 then the measured product of branching ratios@xcite br(b^0 d_s(2317)k ) br(d_s(2317 ) d_s ^0 ) = ( 4.4 0.8 1.1)10 ^ -5 implies that @xmath11 , consistent with the @xmath0 being a canonical @xmath12 @xmath1 meson .    in view of this , cahn and jackson",
    "have examined the feasibility of describing the masses and decay widths of the low lying @xmath3 and @xmath4 states within the constituent quark model@xcite .",
    "they assume a standard spin - dependent structure for the quark - antiquark interaction ( see below ) and allow general vector and scalar potentials .",
    "their conclusion is that it is very difficult to describe the data in this scenario .",
    "indeed , the @xmath0 lies some 160 mev below most model predictions ( see ref.@xcite for a summary ) , leading to speculation that the state could be a @xmath13 molecule@xcite or a tetraquark@xcite .",
    "such speculation is supported by the isospin violating discovery mode of the @xmath0 and the proximity of the s - wave @xmath13 threshold at 2358 - 2367 mev .",
    "other studies have been made with qcd sum rules@xcite , using heavy quark symmetry to examine decay models@xcite , or in unitarised chiral models@xcite .",
    "although these proposals have several attractive features , it is important to exhaust possible canonical @xmath1 descriptions of the @xmath0 before resorting to more exotic models .",
    "here we propose a simple modification to the standard vector coulomb+scalar linear quark potential model that maintains good agreement with the charmonium spectrum and agrees remarkably well with the @xmath3 and @xmath4 spectra .",
    "possible experimental tests of this scenario are discussed .",
    "the spectra we seek to explain are summarised in table [ ddsspectratab ] . unfortunately",
    ", the masses of the @xmath14 ( labelled @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 ( labelled @xmath17 ) are poorly determined .",
    "belle have observed@xcite the @xmath14 in @xmath18 decays and claim a mass of @xmath19 mev with a width of @xmath20 , while focus@xcite find @xmath21 mev with a width @xmath22 . while some authors choose to average these values , we regard them as incompatible and consider the cases separately below . finally , there is an older mass determination from belle@xcite of @xmath23 mev with a width of @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath25 has been seen in @xmath18 decays to @xmath26 and @xmath27 by belle@xcite .",
    "a breit - wigner fit yields a mass of @xmath28 mev and a width of @xmath29 mev .",
    "alternatively , a preliminary report from cleo@xcite cites a mass of @xmath30 mev and a width of @xmath31 mev .",
    "finally , focus@xcite obtain a lower neutral @xmath25 mass of @xmath21 mev .",
    "other masses in table [ ddsspectratab ] are obtained from the pdg compilation@xcite .",
    "the bottom flavoured meson spectra of table [ btab ] have been obtained with the ` average ' extended model parameters and @xmath32 gev . as with the open charm spectra , a flavour - dependent constant was fit to each pseudoscalar .",
    "the second row reports recently measured p - wave @xmath18 meson masses@xcite ; these are in reasonable agreement with the predictions of the first row",
    ".    when these results are ( perhaps incorrectly ) extrapolated to light quark masses , light scalar mesons are possible .",
    "thus a simple @xmath33 interpretation of the enigmatic @xmath34 and @xmath35 mesons becomes feasible .",
    "finally , the work presented here may explain the difficulty in accurately computing the mass of the @xmath36 in lattice simulations .",
    "if the extended quark model is correct , it implies that important mass and spin - dependent interactions are present in the one - loop level one - gluon - exchange quark interaction .",
    "it is possible that current lattice computations are not sufficiently sensitive to the ultraviolet behaviour of qcd to capture this physics .",
    "the problem is exacerbated by the nearby , and presumably strongly coupled , @xmath13 continuum ; which requires simulations sensitive to the infrared behaviour of qcd .",
    "thus heavy - light mesons probe a range of qcd scales and make an ideal laboratory for improving our understanding of the strong interaction .          for recent reviews of open charm states see e.  s.  swanson , phys .",
