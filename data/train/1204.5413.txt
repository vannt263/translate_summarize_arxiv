    "metamaterials , consisting of subwavelength artificial unit cells , show a great potential in optical applications , such as perfect lenses  @xcite and invisibility cloaks.@xcite hyperbolic metamaterials ( hmm ) are of special interest because of their unusual hyperbolic dispersion curves  @xcite that support radiative modes with unbounded wavenumbers .",
    "because of the diverging radiative local density of states ( ldos ) , a point emitter in such a medium would exhibit instantaneous radiative decay.@xcite this broadband ` super - singularity '  @xcite is indeed broadband , since the hyperbolic dispersion does not rely on specific resonances .",

    "usually unit cells are larger than emitter sizes , which makes @xmath1 the more important limiting factor to the radiative ldos .     and @xmath6 , respectively , and their sum equals the period @xmath1 of the unit cell .",

    "it is shown that the nonlocal response gives rise a large - wavevector cutoff in the dispersion , inversely proportional to the fermi velocity of the electron gas .",
    "in fact , the dispersion in hyperbolic media becomes no longer strictly hyperbolic .",
    "accordingly , we identify a new and fundamental limit on the enhancement of the radiative emission rates of hmms .",
    "in particular , we show that the radiative ldos does not grow arbitrarily large even in the ideal limiting case that all three aforementioned parameters  @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 vanish , since the intrinsic nonlocal response turns the ` super - singularity ' into a finite broadband ldos enhancement . on a more general level ,",
    "our results illustrate the need , as for metallic nanoparticles  @xcite , to take nonlocal response into account in homogenization theories , where the goal is to predict the effective properties of metamaterials with ever decreasing unit cell sizes .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "v , we investigate the ldos of the hmms , before discussing our results and concluding in sec .",
    "finally , details of the calculations can be found in appendices  a - c .",
    "we consider a similar multilayer hmm geometry as in the recent experiments by tumkur _",

    "@xcite , see fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the unit cell is a sub - wavelength dielectric - metal bilayer , which is relatively simple and cheap to fabricate  @xcite and allows analytical analysis . for an effective - medium description of such a metamaterial ,",
    "a local - response approximation ( lra ) is usually employed , i.e. spatial dispersion is neglected .",
    "this gives the effective dispersion relation @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "below the plasma frequency @xmath13 , where @xmath14 in the drude model of a pure plasma , the dielectric tensor elements @xmath15 and @xmath16 can have opposite signs by a proper choice of the filling factor @xmath17 . then the dispersion becomes hyperbolic , meaning that an iso - frequency contour becomes a hyperbola rather than the usual ellipse in the @xmath18-plane .",
    "the length of this contour diverges , and so does the radiative ldos .",
    "although we discuss metal - dielectric bilayer structures , we want to point out that our theory may also be applied to structures where the metal is replaced by other materials with a drude response.@xcite    in the present paper , we go beyond the lra , and discuss the optical properties of the hmms in the linearized hydrodynamic drude model ( hdm ) within the thomas - fermi approximation.@xcite in the hdm , the metal supports both the usual divergence - free ( ` transverse ' ) and rotation - free ( ` longitudinal ' ) waves . above the plasma frequency",
    "both types of waves can propagate .",
    "the dispersion @xmath19 of the transverse waves is given by @xmath20 while @xmath21 of the longitudinal waves follows from @xmath22 , in terms of the dielectric functions    [ hdm ] @xmath23    here , @xmath0 is the drude damping , @xmath13 is the plasma frequency , and the nonlocal parameter @xmath24 is equal to @xmath25 with @xmath26 representing the fermi - velocity . while @xmath27 is the familiar drude dielectric function , @xmath28 depends on @xmath26 and describes nonlocal response .",
    "to calculate the exact dispersion equation for the infinitely extended hmm , we employ a transfer - matrix method for both transverse and longitudinal waves combined .",

    "[ fig2](a ) we observe three non - coinciding hyperbolic dispersion curves in the small-@xmath39 region , one for local and two for nonlocal response .",
    "this tells us that the hdm is not just a local theory with a large - wave vector cutoff added , since then the curves for local and for nonlocal response would have coincided for small wavevectors .",
    "furthermore , the two nonlocal hyperbolic curves do not coincide , the one for a strongly subwavelength unit cell @xmath40 and the other for @xmath41 .",
    "this illustrates that the size of the unit cell affects effective - medium properties , even in the deep subwavelength limit , which goes against common wisdom obtained in the lra .",
    "the reason for this is that in the hdm the longitudinal wave in the metal layer has a large vector @xmath42 , so that typically the condition @xmath43 is not satisfied even in the deep subwavelength limit .",
    "thus , the longitudinal wave can probe the finite size of the unit cell even though @xmath44 , and this gives rise to the periodicity - dependent dispersion curve of fig .",

    "we stated in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) that unlike in the lra , in the hdm the effective parameter @xmath63 simply equals the ( positive ) permittivity @xmath57 .",

    "iii , it was demonstrated the dispersion curves in the lra and hdm differ significantly . to understand this better , here we relate these essential differences to the different properties of single metal layers in both theories , knowing that the bulk modes of the hmm result from the coupling of spps of neighboring metal layers .",
    "so we investigate the spps supported by a single metal layer , first analytically in the quasi - static limit . with respect to the magnetic field",

    "its dispersion is such that @xmath72 has @xmath50 as an upper bound in the limit @xmath41 .",
    "so we can now understand that it is this nonlocal ` ceiling ' for the single - layer spp wavenumber that leads to a cutoff of @xmath45 for the bulk modes of the metamaterial , as we saw in fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] we analyze numerically the effect of retardation on the spp dispersion of a single au layer in free space , for local and nonlocal response . with retardation , near the light cone also even - mode solutions exist .",

    "the gray areas are forbidden regions for the spp modes , with light cones on the left.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "the discussed dramatic modification of the metamaterial dispersion due to nonlocal response will also strongly affect the broadband super - singularity known to occur in the local - response ldos , as we shall see .",

    "( [ hdm ] ) for the metal . for the multilayered hmm",
    ", @xmath78 can be decoupled into separate contributions from tm and te modes .",
    "tm modes support the hyperbolic dispersion curve , and greatly dominate the ldos , so we will neglect the te contribution to the ldos .",
    "if we first neglect loss , then only radiative modes contribute to the ldos .",
    "for an electric dipole with moment @xmath83 , the contribution to the ldos of a single radiative mode is proportional to @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the properly normalized mode function.@xcite in the lra , for the limiting case of @xmath52 , the single - mode contribution to the ldos scales linearly in @xmath39 as @xmath45 and @xmath62 tend to infinity .",

    "the derivations leading to eq .",

    "( [ eq6 ] ) entails that nonlocal response leads to a large upper bound to the radiative ldos of the hmm , proportional to @xmath92 .",
    "this exceeds the free - space radiative ldos approximately by @xmath93 , which is of order @xmath94 for most metals .    when taking metallic drude loss into account , then the ldos has contributions both from radiative modes and from nonradiative quenching , the latter due to loss . for the limiting case of @xmath52",
    ", we already discussed that @xmath61 tends to @xmath95 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) . for large wavevectors @xmath45",
    "also the other component @xmath96 tends to @xmath97 .",
    "thus , to the extent that @xmath7 is lossless , the evanescent mode with large @xmath45 does not contribute to the nonradiative ldos , which therefore stays finite . as a result ,",
    "the total ldos containing both radiative and nonradiative contributions in the hdm converges as @xmath52 . in the low - loss case , where the radiation ldos is dominant , eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) is an accurate expression of the total ldos , as we verify by numerically exact simulation below .",
    "we calculate the ldos numerically exactly by merging two methods : the local - response transfer matrix method by toma to calculate the green function of arbitrary multilayer media  @xcite , and the aforementioned hdm extension of the transfer matrix method.@xcite the details can be found in appendix d.    figure  [ fig4](a ) depicts the ldos enhancement , defined as the ratio between ldos in the hmm and in free space , as a function of the periodicity @xmath1 .",
    "clearly , in the hdm the ldos converges to a finite value as @xmath52 .",
    "this proves that both the radiative and nonradiative ldos in the hdm are finite .",
    "by contrast , in the lra the ldos diverges as @xmath98 , where the nonradiative ldos has a dominant contribution.@xcite the hdm ceases to be valid for @xmath99 , but the ldos enhancement value in the limit @xmath52 is a useful upper bound .",
    "we also calculated the ldos for the lossless case [ not shown fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) ] , and we find smaller values for the ldos owing to the missing nonradiative contribution , but the same trend for @xmath52 .",
    "this proves that nonlocal response rather than loss is responsible for removing the singularity of the radiative ldos . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) we compare the limiting ldos for the numerically exact method in the lossy case with the lossless analytical approximation of eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , when artificially varying the fermi velocity .",
    "the value from the exact method is only larger than that from eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) by around @xmath100 .",
    "we attribute the small difference in ldos to the nonradiative ldos due to the drude loss .",
    "thus , the loss acts as a small perturbation to the radiative ldos .     at the center of the free space layer of the hyperbolic metamaterial for @xmath38 .",

    "parameters of the hyperbolic metamaterial as in fig .",
    "[ fig2].,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "for finite - sized unit cells , small loss gives rises to a regular perturbation of the radiative ldos , both in the local and in the nonlocal response theories .",
    "however , the theories start to differ dramatically in the limit of infinitely small unit cells . in particular , in the nonlocal hydrodynamic drude model the small variation of the radiative ldos with small loss is quite different from the previously found radiative ldos scaling with loss in the local theory as @xmath3 for infinitely small unit cells.@xcite    the small increase of the total ldos due to loss is also quite different from spontaneous - emission rates of a point emitter inside a homogeneous absorbing medium , where the loss induces non - radiative quenching that can dramatically decrease the radiative decay efficiency.@xcite in this sense , the nonlocal response regularizes the singularity not only of the radiative but also of the nonradiative ldos of a lossy hmm .",
    "one can interpret this finite nonradiative ldos as due to a nonlocal screening of the electron scattering loss.@xcite in a certain high wave - vector region the reverse can also occur , namely the enhancement of the nonradiative ldos by the nonlocal response , when not only taking drude loss into account , as we do here , but also electron - hole pair absorption . by neglecting any dielectric response of the metal apart from the ( hydrodynamic ) drude response , we underestimate the nonradiative ldos of real metals . however , the important conclusion that the nonlocal response removes the singularity of nonradiative ldos is still valid.@xcite    in conclusion , we have shown that the hydrodynamic drude model gives closed non - hyperbolic dispersion relations for hyperbolic metamaterials , with a fundamental wavevector cutoff @xmath102 .",
    "these effective dispersion relations have hyperbolic limits for small wavevectors , but the precise hyperbola depends on the subwavelength size of the unit cell , contrary to consensus based on the local - response approximation .",
    "we find that the hydrodynamic model regularizes the broadband super - singularity of the radiative ldos , and provides a large physical upper bound proportional to @xmath92 . in practice ,",
    "considering the finite values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , i.e. , the finite sizes of the unit - cell and the emitter , we usually have @xmath103 .",
    "this indicates that the size effects have a dominant role in limiting the ldos enhancement .",
    "thus , under an upper bound set up by the nonlocal response , hyperbolic metamaterials have a plenty of room for improvement in boosting light - matter interactions by decreasing the sizes of the unit - cell and the emitter .",
    "we thank s. raza for stimulating discussions . this work was financially supported by an h.  c. rsted fellowship ( w.y . ) .",
    "since the hydrodynamic dynamics allows the excitation of longitudinal waves , the unambiguous solution of the nonlocal - response dynamics requires additional boundary conditions ( abcs ) , complementing the maxwell boundary conditions .",
    "as is well known , the maxwell boundary conditions are a consequence of maxwell s equations themselves , in the sense that the derivation of the boundary conditions only involves maxwell s equations plus mathematics ( the gauss and stokes theorems ) .",
    "quite analogously , abc s are not a matter of choice but can be derived from the ( linearized ) hydrodynamic equations , at least for a given equilibrium free - electron density profile @xmath104.@xcite when assuming a simple zero - to - nonzero step profile of @xmath104 at the dielectric - metal interfaces , this unambiguously leads to one and only one required abc , namely the continuity of the normal component of the free - electron current @xmath105.@xcite let us now write the relative permittivity of the dielectric medium as @xmath7 , and the dielectric response of the metal as @xmath106 .",
    "we assume that @xmath106 is given by the sum of a nonlocal hydrodynamic drude free - electron response plus @xmath107 , the latter describing the remaining dielectric response of the metal .",
    "since one of the maxwell boundary conditions is the conservation of the normal component of the displacement field , the abc is equivalent to the condition @xmath108 where @xmath109 represent the electric fields in the metal and dielectric , respectively , and @xmath110 is the unit vector normal to the boundary . from eq .",
    "( [ abc1 ] ) , we see that the normal electric field is discontinuous across the boundary when @xmath111 .",
    "a jump in the electric field occurs due to the surface charge produced by polarization of the _ bound _ electrons both in the dielectric and in the metal .",
    "we discuss the abc in some detail , because moch ' an _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , whose pioneering transfer matrix method we employ here , and also recently cirac ` i _",
    "et al._@xcite used instead the continuity of the normal component of the electric field as the abc , @xmath112 or equivalently the continuity of the normal component of the displacement current .",
    "there is no derivation of the latter abc in refs .",
    "it happens to be only correct , in agreement with eq .",

    "moch ' an _ et al . _",
    "@xcite applied their abc for simplicity and write that they thereby ignore the discontinuity of the electric field , due to the accumulation at the surface of bound charges .",
    "our main point is here that without additional complication the correct abc can be implemented , and that many physical predictions of the hydrodynamic drude model are sensitive to implementing the abc correctly .    to understand the abc physically , recall that in the hdm the dynamics of the free electrons is described by the equation of motion @xmath116 = - \\frac{{\\boldsymbol\\nabla { p_{\\deg } } } } { n } + e\\left ( { \\mathbf e + \\mathbf v \\times \\mathbf b } \\right ) , \\label{emotion}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 is the pressure from the ground state energy of the degenerate quantum fermi gas , and @xmath118 is the free - electron density .",
    "the pressure force @xmath119 @xmath120 drives the free electrons diffusing from the high density region to the low density region .",
    "it is this force that prevents the free - electron charge from accumulating on the boundary surface , since the existence of a free - electron surface charge would cause an infinitely large pressure force , which is unphysical .",
    "the nonexistence of the surface free - electron charge indicates that the free - electron current should be continuous across the boundary , as the abc  ( [ abc1 ] ) indeed describes .",
    "by contrast , in the abc of eq .",
    "( [ abc2 ] ) , there exists no surface charges at all .",
    "this indicates that the pressure force somehow smears out not only the surface free - electron charge in the metal but also the surface polarization charges in both the metal and the dielectric .",
    "however , one can not expect the smearing out of the surface polarization charges in the hdm , since the pressure force only acts on the free electrons in the metal . in this sense , the abc of eq .",
    "( [ abc2 ] ) is not consistent with the assumed dynamics and thus not physically sound .",
    "there is another perhaps simpler argument , a consistency check that confirms that the abc of eq .",
