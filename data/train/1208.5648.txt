    "+ structured substrates are also of great current research interest due to their wetting properties .",
    "in particular , the control and manipulation of interfaces is utilised in a wide range of microfluidic devices and smart surfaces .",

    "controllable undulation of this interface is being exploited for various applications , for example as a switchable diffraction grating  @xcite , or curvature - driven particle assembly  @xcite .",
    "+ when the wetting fluid is nematic , the behaviour is additionally enriched by the long - range interactions between the substrate and the interface , which are mediated by the elasticity of distortions in the nematic s orientation , and by the orientation - dependent effects ( anchoring ) at the interface itself . on such surfaces ,",
    "multiple filled states are achievable , with interfaces characterised by differing shape profiles .",
    "the interface shape reveals the existence of distinct nematic textures within the grooves .",
    "first - order transitions between these states may occur , driven by the anchoring strength or the substrate topography  @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we examine how we may switch between distinct metastable filled states with the use of electric fields . in particular , the role of the interface in the switching dynamics will be investigated .",
    "we focus our attention on the coupling of the electric field to gradients in the nematic order .",
    "such coupling is of two main types : coupling to gradients in the rotational orientation , termed flexoelectricity and first identified by meyer  @xcite , and coupling to gradients in the degree of nematic order , termed order - electricity and first identified by prost and marcerou  @xcite .",
    "+ we find that order - electricity is a viable mechanism for wetting whilst specific flexoelectric coupling is required to switch between nematic filled states with distinct textures .",

    "in particular , two filled states co - exist : the unbent ( @xmath84 or @xmath67 ) filled state , where the ni interface is flat and pinned at the top corners of the grooves , and the bent ( @xmath83 ) state where the ni interface , inside the grooves , is bent .",
    "when the system changes from a dry state to the bent filled state , a filling transition occurs but there is no unbending transition .",

    "we have reported the results of a hybrid lattice - boltzmann / finite - element approach to simulate field induced transitions between nematic filled states in rectangular gratings . in particular , we investigated how the application of electric fields , with flexoelectric or order - electric coupling to the nematic , may be used to switch between distinct textures .",
    "we have found that order - electric coupling enables switching between states where the plateaux of the rectangular grating are dry and those where they are wet , with the nematic texture in the grooves remaining unchanged , whilst flexoelectric coupling , specifically the component with coefficient @xmath33 , allows for switching between the various nematic textures that may fill the groove .",
    "+ clearly the presence of the interface is of central importance to the transitions induced by order - electricity , but even in the case of flexoelectric coupling , the interface also affects the dynamics . to demonstrate this",

    "[ fig : comparison ] shows the free energy barrier to be roughly twice as large in the wet case as in the filled case .",
    "by contrast , the pathways of @xmath154 and @xmath136 are similar and the free energy barriers have roughly the same maximum . we conclude that for @xmath132 the motion of the interface aids the transition , while for @xmath136 , the interface does not move significantly and thus the transition is similar in nature to @xmath154 .",
    "+ further work remains to be done on the effect of deviations of the electric field from uniformity , including flexo / order - electric self - polarisation , dielectric anisotropy and differing permittivities of the substrate and fluid .",
    "however , we have shown that , given a suitable liquid crystal , these effects are second - order and do not affect the field symmetry driving the transitions . + another avenue for future work is to extend the study to three dimensions .",
    "the application of an electric field may induce gradients in @xmath24 along @xmath72 , breaking the translational symmetry to produce periodic variations in the longitudinal direction of the grooves .",
    "a difficulty in simulating such a system is that the repeat length along @xmath72 is imposed by the length of the simulation boxin this direction , and may not match that naturally adopted by the system .",
    "+ in concusion , the results presented here describe a simple realisation of flexoelectric switching between nematic filled states , in restricted ( two - dimensional ) rectangular gratings .",
