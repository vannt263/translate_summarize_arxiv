    "riemannian metrics on shape space are of great interest for many procedures in data analysis and computer vision .",
    "they lead to geodesics , to curvature and diffusion .",
    "eventually one also needs statistics on shape space .",
    "the shape space used in this paper is the orbifold @xmath12 of unparametrized immersions of a compact oriented @xmath1-dimensional manifold @xmath0 into @xmath5 , see @xcite : @xmath13 the shape space @xmath14 of submanifolds in @xmath5 of type @xmath0 used in @xcite is a special case of this .",
    "the quest for suitable riemannian metrics was started by michor and mumford in @xcite , where it was found that the simplest and most natural such metric induces vanishing geodesic distance on shape space @xmath15 .",
    "one attempt to strengthen the metric is by adding weights depending on the curvature . for curves , where there is only one notion of curvature , this was done in @xcite . in higher dimensions , there are several curvature invariants .",
    "we are especially interested in the case @xmath16 , where the curvature invariants are the mean and gau curvature .",
    "mean curvature weights were used in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we take up these investigations by adding a gau curvature term to the definition of the metric .",
    "a riemannian metric on @xmath17 is a family of positive definite inner products @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent vector fields on @xmath2 along @xmath7 .",
    "we require that our metrics will be invariant under the action of @xmath21 , hence the quotient map resulting from dividing by this action will be a riemannian submersion .",
    "this means that the tangent map of the quotient map @xmath22 is a metric quotient mapping between all tangent spaces .",
    "thus we will get riemannian metrics on @xmath15 .",
    "riemannian submersions have a very nice effect on geodesics : the geodesics on the quotient space @xmath15 are exactly the images of the horizontal geodesics on the top space @xmath23 .",
    "the metrics we will look at are of the form : @xmath24 here @xmath8 is the standard metric on @xmath2 , @xmath9 is the induced metric on @xmath0 , @xmath10 is the induced volume density , @xmath25 is the weingarten mapping of @xmath7 and @xmath26 is a suitable smooth function depending on the mean curvature @xmath27 and gau curvature @xmath28 .",
    "since @xmath29 is just multiplication with a smooth positive function , the horizontal bundle consists exactly of those vector fields which are pointwise normal to @xmath30 , see @xcite .",
