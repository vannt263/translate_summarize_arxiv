    "synchrotron radiation of neutrino pairs from a strongly magnetized degenerate gas of ultrarelativistic electrons in a neutron star has been studied by many authors ( see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "all cited considerations of the problem are based on a single - particle approach , i.e. except for the pauli principle , no interaction among the electrons is taken into account . however , due to the electromagnetic interaction , an electron moving along a circular orbit involves in its motion a number of neighboring electrons . in other words ,",
    "the electron , moving in the electron gas , is followed by a cloud of virtual particles and holes .",
    "when annihilating , they also produce a flux of neutrino pairs going in the same direction as @xmath1 radiation of the initial electron . to evaluate this effect at the lowest order of coupling constants",
    "one has to include in the matrix element of weak interactions two feynman diagrams , shown in fig . 1 .    by taking into account the pauli principle , the first diagram describes the mechanism of @xmath2 synchrotron radiation discussed in the literature .",
    "the second diagram corresponds to the interaction of the initial electron with a weak neutrino field via intermediate particle and hole excitations , which are also included in the photon propagator .",
    "naively , the second diagram contribution to the matrix element might appear to be @xmath3 times smaller than the first one .",
    "however , as we will show , this is not the case .",
    "in fact , the fine structure constant enters only in the medium polarization function @xmath4 , shown in the diagram as a loop .",
    "so , the effective weak interaction via the medium polarization introduces , as compared to the first diagram , an extra factor which , in the case of a transversal virtual photon , is of the order @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the total four - momentum carried out by the neutrino pair . to estimate this factor one should take into account that synchrotron radiation from an ultrarelativistic electron goes into a narrow cone with angle @xmath7 relative to its velocity . here",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are the mass and the energy , respectively , of the electron . by this reason",
    "one has ( we set @xmath10 ) @xmath11 i.e. , the total four momentum transfer is much smaller than the total energy of the radiated neutrino pair .",
    "let us consider a degenerate electron gas under the following condition : , the population of excited landau levels above the fermi energy exponentially tends to zero , and the synchrotron radiation becomes not relevant as a mechanism of neutrino pair emission . ]",
    "@xmath12 since @xmath13 is of the order of the medium temperature @xmath14 , one has @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the larmor frequency of degenerate electrons near the fermi energy @xmath17",
    ". then one can neglect the small contribution of the magnetic field to the medium polarization , and use the polarization function @xmath18 of an isotropic electron gas which , when @xmath19 , can be estimated as the square of the plasma frequency , defined as @xmath20 thus , one obtains @xmath21 because @xmath22 and the last ratio is small for a degenerate ultrarelativistic electron gas",
    ".    published calculations of @xmath2 emissivity due to synchrotron radiation from an electron gas in the neutron star made use of exact wave functions of the electron in a uniform magnetic field . in this case ,",
    "integration of the squared matrix element leads to either laguerre or bessel functions with a complicated behavior , and summation over all initial and final landau states is a delicate problem .",
    "actually , however , magnetic fields inside neutron stars typically satisfy the condition @xmath23 , which means that electrons near the fermi surface move semi - classically , and there is no reason to use exact landau states in order to calculate the neutrino pair emissivity . in order to study @xmath2 synchrotron radiation of ultrarelativistic electrons",
    ", we apply an alternative method of calculation , which explicitly makes use of the fact that the radiating particle moves semi - classically , although it takes into account the interaction among particles in a quantum way .",
    "this method has been developed by baier and katkov @xcite to consider @xmath24 -synchrotron radiation in vacuum .",
    "a detailed derivation of this method applied to @xmath24-radiation is given , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in order to test our calculation",
    "technic , in section ii we focus on @xmath2 synchrotron radiation of ultrarelativistic electrons in strongly magnetized vacuum , i.e. we do not set any limitation on the radiated energy of the neutrino pair .",
    "we show that the total rate of @xmath2 decay , obtained by our calculation technic , coincides with that obtained by other calculation methods @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we also derive a simple formula for the differential rate of decay in vacuum .",
    "when multiplied by the appropriate statistical factors , thus taking into account the pauli principle , this formula can also be used for the case of an ultrarelativistic electron gas in order to evaluate the contribution of the first diagram shown in fig .",
    "1 , as it is made in section iii . in section",
    "iv we discuss some modifications to be made in our calculation in order to take into account the second diagram shown in fig.1 .",
    "we consider the medium polarization tensor , as well as the photon propagator to be used for an ultrarelativistic degenerate electron plasma . in section",
    "v we calculate the contribution of collective effects to the differential rate of neutrino pair emission . by adding these contributions to that obtained in section iii we arrive to a very simple analytic expression for the differential rate of @xmath2 synchrotron radiation under the physical conditions we considered . in section",
    "vi we apply this formula to evaluate the energy loss and compare our result with that obtained without taking into account collective effects .",
    "we end in section vii with some discussion and conclusions .",
    "an ultra - relativistic particle radiates into a narrow cone with angle @xmath25 relative to its velocity . by this reason , in the process under consideration ,",
    "the transferred four - momentum is much smaller than the @xmath26-boson mass @xmath27 therefore one can use an effective current - current interaction : @xmath28 where @xmath29 represents the neutrino field and @xmath30 stands for the radiating particle field .",
    "the coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the vector and axial - vector weak coupling constants , respectively , of the radiating particle , which also depend on the neutrino type . in the case of radiating electrons ,",
    "the combinations that arise , by summing over all neutrino species , are @xmath33 @xmath34    by modification of the method described in the introduction to weak processes , one obtains the following formula for the differential decay width : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the neutrino and antineutrino four - momenta , respectively , @xmath38 represents the initial quantum state of the electron and @xmath39 denotes the following heisenberg operator : @xmath40 \\frac{u_i\\left ( \\widehat{p}\\right ) } { \\left ( 2\\widehat{h}\\right ) ^{1/2 } }   \\label{2}\\ ] ] with @xmath6 being the total four momentum of the neutrino pair @xmath41 and @xmath42 the fourspinor operator representing the symbolic solution of the dirac equation for a electron with a hamiltonian @xmath43 , which includes the effect of the external field .",
    "it can be obtained from the plane wave fourspinor solution by replacing @xmath44 and @xmath9 to the operators @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "the spin state of the electron is determined by the spinor @xmath47 .",
    "finally , @xmath48 stands for the position operator of the electron .    by using the following identity @xmath49",
    "one can reduce the number of integrations in eq.([1 ] ) @xmath50 since we assume the ultra - relativistic electron motion to be semi - classical , in the expression for @xmath51 only the non - commutativity of the electron operators with the neutrino field operator @xmath52 needs to be taken into account . after this",
