    "we seek to posit a geochemical model for morphogenesis of eukaryotic organisms that includes cellular details .",
    "our aim is to describe the main laws underlying the morphogenetic processes during normal development as well as during possible perturbations resulting in creating structure de novo as in the course of regeneration @xcite . in this inherently multi - scale context",
    ", we must describe the nano - biology of the cell in its environment without unnecessary detail in a manner compatible with macro - biological aspects of the geometrical shape of an organ or entire organism .    indeed",
    ", we shall proceed with a series of anstze , one after another , the first group of which are effectively axiomatic mathematical statements about the structure of cells and the organisms which they comprise .",
    "some aspects of this are inspired by biology as we shall discuss in detail , and others are nothing more than rather obvious but new mathematical formalizations of elementary biological structure .",
    "indeed , for the mathematician and biologist reader alike , the depth of certain anstze may range from sublime to ridiculous  though likely quite differently for the two fields as we shall comment in specific cases .",
    "the second group of anstze governs the `` morphogenetic field '' , a term used by ren thom @xcite with the concept carefully articulated by the first - named author with misha shubin in @xcite and discussed in some detail here , which determines the time - evolution of cell states .",
    "in fact , our treatment here differs from @xcite insofar as they consider four discrete cell events ( apoptosis , division , movement , growth ) , whereas in our language , the first two are represented by birth / death events ( death alone or death with the birth of two daughters ) , and the latter two by continuous evolution as a path in a certain bundle ( a hilbert space as fiber over a configuration of finitely many distinct points in three - space ) .",
    "one profound contribution of @xcite is what we shall call the `` epigenetic hypothesis '' : _ the distribution of oligo sacchyride residues of glycoconjugates on the cell surface determines the morphogenetic field via an as - yet unknown code .",
    "_ in fact , we are not so absolute as that and relax it here by allowing any other distribution or gradient on the cell surface as well , notably protein or electromagnetic gradients for example .",
    "one nice aspect of the mathematical formalism we have found is that such gradients on the cell surface can be explicitly prescribed in terms of real - valued functions on the two - dimensional sphere .",
    "another notable aspect of the formalism here is the seamless jump in scale from cells to organisms provided by any gromov - hausdorff type metric on measured metric spaces .",
    "indeed , in our description , each cell has its explicit extent in three - space , the union of which forms a metric subspace comprising the organism .",
    "depending upon which features of the organism are to be emphasized , different measures on the cells yield different metrics on the space of organisms .",
    "our precarious multi - scale endeavor is only confounded by the first ansatz :    [ ansatz1 ] no statement in biology is always true except this one .",
    "we first describe the geometry of a single cell in mathematical detail ( based on the biologically sound assumption that cells are star - convex ) , then the notion of cell state which captures certain epigenetic information ( and is succinctly described by a collection of real - valued functions on the two - dimensional sphere @xmath0 of unit radius centered at the origin in space @xmath1 owing to star - convexity ) and finally discuss cell trajectory , i.e. , lifetime from birth to division or to final apoptosis ( programmed cell death ) or necrosis ( death from injury or disease ) .",
    "the structure of a live cell includes the _ microtubule organizing center _ ( mtoc ) or _ centrosome _ , from which emanates a network of microtubules forming the essential part of the cytoskeleton of the cell and holding in place the cell surface just as a system of poles holds in place the surface of a circus tent . most animal and some plant mtoc , apart from its main gamma - tubulin content , contain two cylindrical structures called centrioles meeting at a point ; see figure 1 .",
    "let us say that a cell is _ centriolic _ if its centrosome indeed contains such a pair of centrioles , and likewise an organism if its cells are centriolic .",
    "these organisms are especially amenable to our methods and analyses here since each cell @xmath2 has its distinguished _ mtoc point _ @xmath3 given by the point of contact of the two centrioles .",
    "this is a mere convenience though , and one may rather make the choice of an appropriate point within the centrosome or even an arbitrary point of star - convexity in general .      even comprehending just the geometry of a single cell within an organism already seems hopeless as suggested by figure 2 .",
    "one has only to peruse for example protist organisms ( which are unicellular eukaryotes ) depicted on the left to see a wild geometric diversity of detailed cell shapes .",
    "there are furthermore anatomical anomalies such as meter - long human neuro skeletal cells as depicted on the right with their dendritic extremities .",
    "exotic examples abound .",
    "nevertheless modulo ansatz [ ansatz1 ] , all cells do share a common geometric feature as follows . recall that in mathematics , one says that a region @xmath4 of space @xmath1 is _ star - convex _ with respect to a point @xmath5 provided that for each point @xmath6",
    "the line segment @xmath7 connecting @xmath8 to @xmath9 also lies in @xmath10 .",
    "= 1.9 in  = 2.5 in    [ ansatz2 ] a cell @xmath2 is star - convex with respect to some point @xmath11 in its mtoc , and in particular for a centriolic cell , we may take @xmath12 as the point of contact between centrioles .",
    "it is a biological axiom , to the extent that such there be in light of ansatz [ ansatz1 ] , that the cytoskeleton of a cell is star - convex with respect to a point in its mtoc . in our idealization of the geometry",
    ", we may consider the outer surface of the cytoskeleton as a cell surface .",
    "in reality , one would presumably take a small epsilon neighborhood of the star - convex cytoskeleton to describe the cell shape , though many cells are star - convex already with epsilon equal to zero .",
    "indeed , we shall later consider only epsilon neighborhoods of cells anyway , so the geometric idealization of ansatz [ ansatz2 ] from cytoskeleton to cell is unimportant",
    ".    fix in space the centrosome of a centriolic cell at some instant in time .",
    "let @xmath13 be the unit vector in the direction along the cylindrical axis for the earlier - replicated centriole and @xmath14 the unit vector in the direction of the later - replicated one , with @xmath15 . in each case",
    ", the direction along the cylindrical axis is determined by the fact that the mtoc point of centriole contact occurs asymmetrically at a preferred starting end of each cylinder .",
    "a centriolic cell thus determines a so - called positively oriented orthonormal 3-frame @xmath16 describing the spatial orientation of each cell .",
    "we shall not in fact require this further extra structure , but it is worth noting .",
    "now , fix a cell @xmath2 with its mtoc point @xmath17 . given a unit vector @xmath18 , where @xmath0 denotes the usual two - dimensional sphere in @xmath1 ( comprised of endpoints of vectors of unit length based at the origin )",
    ", there is a corresponding ray from @xmath8 in the same direction of @xmath19 , and this ray meets the cell surface at a single point at some distance @xmath20 from @xmath8 according to star - convexity . see figure 3 .",
    "this assignment @xmath21 of a positive real - valued function on the two - dimensional sphere @xmath0 completely determines the shape of the cell @xmath2 .    to recapitulate this section ,",
    "given a eukaryotic cell @xmath2 , there is an mtoc point @xmath22 , which is well - defined without choice provided @xmath2 is centriolic , with respect to which @xmath2 is star - convex together with a shape function @xmath23 which completely determines the geometrical cell shape @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the usual length of a vector @xmath26 in @xmath1 .",
    "there is furthermore a canonical identification of the standard sphere @xmath0 with the cell surface @xmath27 given by the mapping @xmath28 .",
    "the volume @xmath29 of @xmath2 and its surface area @xmath30 are respectively given in terms of a sufficiently regular shape function @xmath31 as @xmath32 ^ 3~ da,\\cr a(c)&=\\int\\int_{{\\mathbb s}^2 } \\bigl | \\nabla \\rho_c(\\vec\\xi)\\cdot\\vec \\xi",
    "\\bigr |~da,\\cr \\endaligned\\ ] ]      what exactly constitutes a cell state for morphogenesis or any other purpose depends upon the implied internal structure of the cell and must reflect the predictions and interactions of the theory that depend upon it .",
    "one obvious aspect of cell state is the shape function @xmath33 and another is the spatial location of the mtoc point @xmath34 introduced in the previous section . taken together , these determine the natural parametrization @xmath35 of the cell surface @xmath27 .",
    "it follows from the existence of the parametrization that any real - valued function @xmath36 can equivalently be specified by simply pulling back to a real - valued function @xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "in particular , the density of some substance on the cell surface can be conveniently specified by just such a real - valued function on @xmath0 . to account for area distortion ]    cell state",
    "is determined by the shape function @xmath39 together with a collection @xmath40 of cell surface densities @xmath41 , for @xmath42 .",
    "the collection @xmath43 of cell surface densities is called the _ epigenetic spectrum _ of the the cell .",
    "we shall refer to the full @xmath44 tuple @xmath45 including the shape as the _ ( internal ) cell state_.    in fact , the cell surface @xmath27 is relatively fluid with sub - regions evolving in time to different shapes within the cell surface .",
    "thus , we should expect the typical distribution of substance on the cell surface to evolve continuously in time .    of special interest",
    "are the distributions of oligo conjugates , small oligosaccharide residues of glycoconjugates on the cell surface .",
    "there are up to 12 varieties of monosaccharides and disaccharides in oligosaccharide residues of glycoconjugates ( six of hexose type ) .",
    "there have been numerous indications that these oligosaccharide residues are related to cellular morphogenetic pathways as has been formulated as an epigenetic hypothesis in @xcite and the references therein .",
    "thus , we propose that the cell state @xmath46 of @xmath2 includes both the cell shape @xmath39 and the epigenetic spectrum of cell densities @xmath47 of the corresponding number of  coding \" oligo conjugates , as per the epigenetic hypothesis , the nature and number of which should be determined experimentally .",
    "here is an important point of contact between one aspect of our theoretical work and experimental determination .",
    "we leave open the possibility of extending this minimal set of functions determining cell state with other molecular compounds or other factors such as protein or electromagnetic gradients defined on the cell surface , where recent works @xcite suggest the latter are central to morphogenesis .",
    "recall @xcite that there is a standard distance between two tuples @xmath48 and @xmath49 of functions @xmath50 given by their",
    "_ @xmath51 distance _",
    "@xmath52 indeed , letting @xmath53 denote the so - called square integrable functions on @xmath0 , the distance @xmath54 gives the collection @xmath55^{n+1}$ ] of all possible cell states @xmath46 the structure of a hilbert space .",
    "hardly worth mentioning mathematically , the next ansatz gives an explicit concept of distance between cell states .",
    "[ a : l^2 ] the natural distance space '' ) more generally taking @xmath56 , for certain specified parameters @xmath57 .",
    "] between cell states @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the @xmath51 distance @xmath58 .",
    "the sperm - fertilized cell oocyte becomes the zygote , the first cell @xmath59 of the organism , which next mitotically divides to ten or more generations in a highly organized paroxysm of cell divisions , no time at all for diffusive or other equilibria to develop , no time for appreciable cell growth or motion and immediately generating all manner of steep gradients across the early embryo .",
    "recall that the centrosome of a cell @xmath2 at interphase replicates to create a pair of centrosomes .",
    "these centrosomes move to opposite ends of the cell and nucleate microtubules to help form the mitotic spindle separating the chromosomes into two sets , one copy for each daughter cell @xmath60 together with one centrosome for each daughter cell .",
    "one centrosome of @xmath61 or @xmath62 is inherited from the centrosome of @xmath2 , which we call the mother centrosome , while the other , which we call the daughter centrosome since it is younger than its mother , has been assembled upon the mother centrosome before mitosis .",
    "insofar as the replicated centrosomes of @xmath2 are distinguishable , so too are its daughters @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we can thus label each cell in the organism by its phylogeny : a word in the alphabet @xmath63 and @xmath54 , where @xmath63 indicates the daughter @xmath64 that inherits the mother centrosome from @xmath2 and @xmath54 the daughter @xmath65 that inherits the daughter centrosome .",
    "each cell itself is determined by its _ phylogeny _ , a finite word @xmath66 in the two - letter alphabet @xmath67 , including the empty word for the zygote .",
    "this labeling of cells by @xmath63 and @xmath54 is evidently equivalent to the usual structure of embedded phylogenetic tree : a binary tree with gamete for root and with @xmath63 on the right ( say ) and @xmath54 on the left .",
    "[ trajectory ] each cell @xmath2 is born at some instant @xmath68 in time and terminates either through death or cell division at a later instant @xmath69 ; each cell except for the gamete is born with exactly one distinguishable sister .    death may be apoptosis , necrosis or it may reflect some crisis for the organism such as amputation or disintegration",
    ". a somatic cell is always born with exactly one sister and terminates either alone ( by death ) or in giving birth to its daughters ( by division ) .",
    "it is worth saying explicitly that ansatz [ trajectory ] is biologically tautological , no more than a self - evident remark but is a necessary aspect of axiomatic mathematical formulation .",
    "indeed , in other important classical mathematical contexts , births as well as deaths can occur only in pairs .",
    "biologically , the ansatz is trivial and can be ignored , for of course it is tautologically so .",
    "vertices of our phylogenetic tree other than the root are thus labeled by the cell event of death or cell division .",
    "edges of the tree correspond to the lifetime of cells , and we will assign as a length of the edge labeled by the cell @xmath2 its lifetime @xmath70 . in this manner , a point in an edge corresponds to the cell @xmath71 at a particular instant @xmath72 in time , where @xmath73 .    according to our assumptions , two sister cells @xmath61 and @xmath62 must share their time of birth @xmath74 with the time of death of their mother ( but see section [ sec : gap ] ) . for an extreme example such as a skeletal muscle cell @xmath2 or an eye lens cell @xmath2 which is fully differentiated once and for all time already in the embryo and never divides again , we find @xmath68 at birth and @xmath69 after death of the organism .",
    "at another extreme are dermal cells with their profuse and nearly identical divisions .",
    "the potency of a cell to produce progeny with different types of tissues and organs or simply to differentiate into many possible cell types is called a morphogenetic potency or just a potency . thus in an organism there are totipotent , pluripotent , bipotent and fully differentiated cells .",
    "let us define the _ potency _ @xmath75 of a cell @xmath2 to be zero if it does not divide at all , and if it does divide , say the daughters have respective epigenetic spectra @xmath76^{n}$ ] , then we compare the spectra defining @xmath77 .",
    "thus , the potency of a fully differentiated cell is nearly zero .",
    "in contrast , a bipotent stem cell , for example , can have a large potency if its product cell line differs substantially in epigenetic spectrum from its stem cell line in the @xmath51 distance .",
    "we define an organism to be the collection of its constituent cells lying in space as determined by a language over the two - letter alphabet given by following the centrosome .",
    "the collection of constituent cell states determines a state of the organism at each instant in time .",
    "a convenient mathematical formalism exists for this as a configuration space of distinct points in space which evolve under time either continuously or through specific rules of birth and death at certain event times together with a bundle over this base space with fiber given by an @xmath51 space of functions on the two - dimensional sphere .",
    "all this is quite mathematically routine given what has come before .",
    "at a given moment in time , the cells @xmath2 underlying an organism comprise a metric subspace which moreover can be further imbued with any function @xmath78 chosen to reflect essential morphological or other parameters of @xmath2 . for example , we could take mass density of a cell , density of distribution of ion channels or other cell constituent concentrations .",
    "we may choose particular functions @xmath78 for specific applications    a fundamental ansatz is that two organisms each at a given moment in time can be profitably compared using gromov - hausdorff ( gh ) type distances ( cf .",
    "appendix a ) between corresponding measured metric spaces .",
    "this is precisely what allows us to finally pass from the cellular to the capacious scale in our investigations .",
    "it is important to note that the comparison of  two organisms \" in this framework should be interpreted first of all as the comparison of the morphology of the same organism at different moments in time reflecting the laws of evolution of its shape .",
    "equally , we consider the comparison of the differences between normal and  crisis \" developmental scenarios ( that is , strong perturbations of proper morphology ) for the same organism at some moment in time .      the zygote @xmath79 comes into being at an instant @xmath80 and then undergoes a sequence of binary divisions , the first one occurring at the instant @xmath81 . at each division , there are distinguishable sister cells produced , and the mother cell producing these progeny subsequently ceases to exist .",
    "and so it goes .",
    "the mother of all cells of the organism is the zygote @xmath79 .",
    "for each subsequent offspring produced , i.e. , each cell that did , does or will or ever occur in the organism there is a well - defined word @xmath66 in the two - letter alphabet @xmath67 as discussed before , where the length of the word is the number of generations from the zygote .",
    "not all words occur for a given organism , and the _ phylogenetic language _ of @xmath82 is the collection @xmath83 of words that do in fact occur for the organism @xmath82 .",
    "let @xmath84 be the cell corresponding to the word @xmath85 including the empty word for the zygote .",
    "thus , each cell @xmath84 is born and dies at respective specific times @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we shall let @xmath88 denote the cell @xmath84 labelled by @xmath66 at time @xmath72 , where @xmath89 with time - dependent cell state @xmath90^{n+1}$ ] , reflecting shape and epigenetic coding , and mtoc point @xmath91 with auxiliary measure @xmath92 .",
    "we have the mathematical definitions of organism and state given by the following biological tautology :    an organism @xmath93 is determined by the collection of its constituent cells @xmath94 and its state by their respective states .",
    "let us say that a cell @xmath95 _ exists _ at some time @xmath72 if @xmath89 for some @xmath96 .",
    "it is convenient to suppress the birth / death times of a cell and write simply @xmath97 to signify the cell at a time @xmath72 at which the cell exists and to signify the empty set otherwise . in the same way ,",
    "let @xmath98 denote the cell state and @xmath99 the measure at a time @xmath72 between cell birth and death and to take constant value zero otherwise ; finally , @xmath100 denotes the mtoc point and @xmath101 the shape function if the cell @xmath95 exists , and these are undefined otherwise .",
    "let @xmath102 be the phylogenetic words of the cells of the organism @xmath82 that exist at time @xmath72 .",
    "the organism @xmath103 at a time @xmath72 is the union of these cells , i.e. , the constituent cells of the organism at the instant @xmath72 .",
    "of course , @xmath104 or any epsilon neighborhood of it inherits the structure of a metric subspace of @xmath1 , and each cell comes with its measure @xmath99 which together give the weighted sum @xmath105 of delta functions as a measure on @xmath104 .    the _ state _ of the weighted organism @xmath106 at time @xmath72 consists of the cell states @xmath98 of its constituent cells .",
    "the collection of mtoc points @xmath107 of cells that exist at time @xmath72 come in their prescribed lexicographic ordering ( where , say @xmath108 ) which we shall call the _ ( labelled ) configuration _ of the organism at time @xmath72 .",
    "recall that if @xmath109 is a metric space , then a _ ( labelled ) configuration _ in @xmath109 of @xmath110 points is a collection of @xmath111 distinct labelled points in @xmath109 ; see appendix b for the barest thumbnail discussion tailored to our own needs and @xcite for instance for further generalities .",
    "it is biologically clear that in fact the mtoc points @xmath112 do give a configuration in @xmath1 , lying in @xmath104 , i.e. , the mtoc points of distinct cells never coincide . indeed",
    ", we have the stronger :    the cells of an organism that exist at each instant in time have disjoint interiors in space @xmath1 .    again a biological tautology , this kind of `` steric '' constraint is commonplace in protein theory for instance .",
    "we do not intend to entirely rule out gap or other cell junctions here , rather , let us consider adding that further layer of detail only later .",
    "the number @xmath113 of mtoc points of the organism @xmath104 is piecewise constant and jumps at various times of lone death ( one point disappears ) or birth ( two new points appear and an old one disappears ) of constituent cells according to ansatz [ trajectory ] .",
    "in fact , there may be finitely many coincidentally simultaneous birth or death times , but we make the following finiteness assumption :    [ a : wha ] for any fixed @xmath72 , there is a finite sequence of event times @xmath114 so that for each time @xmath115 , for @xmath116 , the configurations @xmath117 are equinumerous and evolve continuously in time .",
    "the discussion of how exactly the cell state before determines the specific cell states after a birth event time is postponed until the more speculative considerations of the next section .",
    "`` the time has come ''",
    "the walrus said , `` to talk of many things : of shoes  and ships  and sealing - wax of cabbages",
    " and kings and why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wings . '' this is just to say that now we must discuss things a bit more metaphorically in order to absorb the next anstze .      as humans",
    ", we can perceive the natural world on various levels .",
    "for instance , in pond water one finds paramecia , which we might probe in the lab _ in vivo _ or _ in vitro _ to discern further structure .",
    "going to an extreme , we might travel to cern and uncover the constituent elementary particles .    as human observers",
    ", we do not even want to try to absorb the molecular let alone the atomic or stringy nature of a paramecium .",
    "with what has been called `` willful ignorance '' and also termed `` twice barbarism '' , our vision in morphogenesis had better contain the required cellular and other data even if we shall ultimately and barbarically ignore this level of detail in the large .    to handle the need for minute detail in certain biological regards for cells , we have already introduced the notion of cell state .",
    "we must somehow pass from this data as we have formalized it , corpuscular by its very nature , to the context of continuous data of substantial spatial extent .",
    "naturally enough , we might take an epsilon neighborhood of the actual cells at each instant in time , that is , a neighborhood of @xmath104 in @xmath1 .",
    "we furthermore might naturally let epsilon vary over @xmath104 in order to allow for instance for different packing densities of one type of cell compared to another .",
    "an elegant and precise mathematical formalism for this viewpoint is provided by the class of metrics on measured metric spaces inspired by gh distance . for completeness ,",
    "one such distance ( the sturm @xmath51 distance @xcite ) is explicitly defined in appendix a.    [ ans : gh ] given two organisms @xmath82 and @xmath118 with their respective measures @xmath119 and @xmath120 , gromov - hausdorff type distances between the measured metric spaces @xmath121 and @xmath122 such as the sturm @xmath51 distance capture the geometry of organism morphology .",
    "just as the sturm @xmath51 distance is one among many sensible choices for comparing measured metric spaces , so too , we have the flexibility to take different measures @xmath78 on cells @xmath2 . as an example",
    ", the mass density can be one special case of measures involved in building the morphology of an organism . presumably as a human observer employing it as we have done here",
    "is like observing the world with those x - ray glasses that are bought by gullible children ; we would detect density differences between cells within organisms when we compare them wearing our mass density glasses .",
    "a tadpole and a frog would be easily distinguished by their bone structures for instance .",
    "the formalism we have developed is robust enough to handle general examples exchanging x - ray for other glasses by changing the measure @xmath123 on the fixed metric space that is the organism @xmath104 .      during mitotic division of the cell @xmath2 , the two daughter cells @xmath64 and @xmath65 labelled by centrosomes as",
    "before are separated by a so - called mitotic plane passing through the interior of @xmath2 often asymmetrically .",
    "this separating plane divides the cell surface @xmath27 into two inequivalent regions @xmath124 forming the cell boundary of respective daughters .    [ a : mbe ] the epigenetic spectra of daughters @xmath64 and @xmath65 are nearly inherited in the @xmath51 sense on @xmath0 by inclusion of the cell surfaces @xmath125 from the mother .    on the complementary regions to @xmath126 and @xmath127 in daughter cell surfaces",
    ", there are as - yet unspecified rules of how to extend to a function on the entire cell surface .",
    "this ansatz partly describes the _ morphogenetic birth effect _ , that is , the function that determines the cell states of @xmath128 and @xmath129 at the moment @xmath130 when mitotis is complete from the cell state of @xmath131 of a mother cell as mitosis begins at @xmath132 .",
    "it is not that the biology breaks down during the interval between times @xmath132 and @xmath130 .",
    "after all , there is a sensible moment of birth when the cell membranes of the daughters finally separate that we could also take to be the moment of death of the mother @xmath2 .",
    "the surface concentrations in @xmath133 of the oligo conjugates or other compounds are everywhere defined until this moment and after become the surface concentrations in @xmath134 and @xmath135 . in this sense , again the ansatz is disappointingly tautological biologically .",
    "however , this scenario does _ not hold exactly _ and in our barbaric and willful ignorance , we posit in ansatz [ a : mbe ] a precise sense in which @xmath51 distance suitably measures deviation from this idealized biology .",
    "to recapitulate , given a eukaryotic organism @xmath82 and a time @xmath72 , we have the constituent cells @xmath136 that exist at time @xmath72 indexed by a finite set @xmath137 of words in the alphabet @xmath67 .",
    "the union of these star - convex regions is by definition the organism @xmath138 at time @xmath72 as a metric subspace of @xmath1 .",
    "this region comes equipped with a measure @xmath123 , and it is the measured metric spaces @xmath106 that reflect the large - scale geometry of the organism .",
    "standard methods , called gh type metrics , can be applied to these spaces to quantify the sense in which two organisms have the same shape .",
    "nevertheless , the organism has a complicated state , namely , we take the state of the organism to be the collection of cell states of each of its constituent cells , i.e. , cell states @xmath139 and mtoc points @xmath140 , for @xmath141    on the cellular scale , we have organized things in appendix b into a vector bundle @xmath142 over the space @xmath143 of configurations of finitely many points in @xmath1 , where the fiber over a configuration with @xmath111 points is an @xmath111-tuple of elements in @xmath144^{n+1}$ ] , namely , the cell states of the constituent cells .",
    "thus , the entire organism in its entire state is described at an instant in time as a point in the total space of this bundle over the finite configuration of mtoc points in the base , and the measure @xmath119 is an auxiliary function defined on the base .",
    "the idea from @xcite is that the `` morphogenetic field '' is a function defined on some bundle of states that governs the time evolution of an organism starting from ovum .",
    "their formalism was different with discrete time cell events as was already mentioned . here",
    "we imagine continuous evolution in some @xmath145 with jumps in @xmath111 at finitely many event times compatible with ansatz [ a : wha ] .",
    "the morphogenetic field of @xcite should be realized here as some sort of functional which governs the time evolution of an organism , namely , as a lagrangian action :    [ a : lag ] there is some lagrangian formulation of organism evolution , i.e. , an action functional on paths in @xmath146 whose stationary paths are the time trajectories of organisms .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the lagrangian formulation of ansatz 4.3 is different from that of the underlying physics : our action should be formulated on the space of organism states as we have defined them .    using our definition of potency ( see the end of section [ sec : life ] ) and the observation that each organism starts to differentiate from the zygote having a huge potency towards its later less - potent progeny , we posit :    the average _ potency _ @xmath75 over the set of all cells @xmath2 in an organism is strictly decreasing in generation during embryo development .",
    "this is of course in keeping with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "[ a : sis ] nearly identical sisters almost always remain nearly in contact .",

    "this seems to give a nice explanation for organ formation and other aspects as well and really makes good sense . again , with the @xmath51 distance between cell states , we can conveniently quantify differences between sisters or indeed any pair of cells viz ansatz [ a : sis ]    the morphogenetic field is locally supported in the sense that for any cell @xmath95 that exists , there is a neighborhood @xmath147 of it in @xmath1 so that the forward time evolution of @xmath95 for some fixed interval of time depends only upon the states of the cells in @xmath148 .    in particular",

    "this gh - deviation from ideal outcome is admittedly a bold hypothesis for the dynamics providing thereby the key mechanism driving morphogenesis ranging from embryo development to the creation of proper morphology during the regeneration processes in the event of crisis .",
