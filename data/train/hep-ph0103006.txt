    "in the standard model it has been shown that bound states can be created for every quark but the top ( see for instance  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the latter possibility is ruled out due to the high value of the top quark mass , which is responsible for its short lifetime .",
    "the top quark decays directly into a @xmath2 boson and a @xmath3 quark before being able to create a bound state . in a recent paper  @xcite",
    "it has been shown that a finite probability of formation exists for a supersymmetric bound state made out of a squark stop and an antitop squark , for a certain range of @xmath4 mass and some regions of the mssm parameter space . in that",
    ", the possibility of signal detection at an @xmath1 collider with lep and nlc characteristics has also been investigated by means of a breit  wigner formula .",
    "a more refined result is needed in the threshold region which is characterised by low values of the squark velocity @xmath5 , i.e. = 1 .",
    "[ eq : beta ] for this purpose a by now standard green function approach has been developed ( see  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we will assume that the supersymmetric bound state creation does not differ from the standard model case , as the relevant interaction is driven by qcd and controlled by the mass of the constituent squarks  @xcite .",
    "for this reason the schrdinger green function technique is suitable for treating the problem of the scalar bound state .",
    "it will be used to compute the bound state effects on the cross section of stoponium near threshold .",
    "we will compare the results obtained in this manner to the born cross section estimates for energies above threshold .",
    "the effects of the beam energy spread of the @xmath1 colliders on the computed cross section will be discussed .",
    "the basic idea of the method is to consider the schrdinger green function equation  @xcite ( -e ) g(,,e ) = ( - ) , [ eq : es ] where @xmath6 is the hamiltonian of the system = - + v ( ) , [ eq : h ] and @xmath7 is the potential for the squarks . the imaginary part of the derivative of the green function given by  ( [ eq : es ] ) taken at the origin is proportional to the cross section at threshold  @xcite .",
    "the finite width @xmath8 of the state is taken into account by the substitution e e + i .",
    "[ eq : nrgy ]    unlike the process t |t , [ eq : etotop ] the reaction [ eq : etostop ] proceeds in p  wave , whereas top quarks are produced in s  wave configuration .",
    "this implies the born level cross section to grow as @xmath9 for top production  ( [ eq : etotop ] ) , while for process  ( [ eq : etostop ] ) of scalars one obtains a slower rise , @xmath10 .",
    "the threshold cross section of the process @xmath11 is given by the following expression  @xcite : ( ) = r & & [ eq : stopangle ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the mass and the total width of the @xmath16 boson respectively .",
    "the charges are defined by @xmath17 , @xmath18 , with @xmath19 being the standard electroweak mixing angle and @xmath20 is the left ",
    "right mixing angle .",
    "the @xmath21 term of equation  ( [ eq : stopangle ] ) is obtained  @xcite upon taking the imaginary part of the derivative at the origin of the green function given by  ( [ eq : es ] ) r =    @xmath22 is the @xmath23 component of the green function ) .    for the purpose of our investigation , we will use a coulombic potential for the hamiltonian given in  ( [ eq : h ] ) ( here @xmath24 v = - [ eq : coul ] where @xmath25 is given by the qcd two  loop expression  @xcite    _ s(q^2)= \\ { 1- } [ eq:2loops ] and is calculated at a fixed value of the bohr radius @xmath26 given by r_b= .",
    "[ eq : rb ] the validity of this choice has been shown ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , and is essentially justified by the fact that the stop quark should be much heavier than all other quarks except ( maybe ) the top .",
    "the high value of @xmath27 implies from  ( [ eq : rb ] ) that the average distance between two squarks inside the scalar bound state is small , and therefore the dominant term of the potential is the coulomb expression given in  ( [ eq : coul ] ) .",
    "this assumption for the bound state potential allows us to obtain an analytic expression for the green function needed for the threshold cross section  @xcite .    following the above cited authors we introduce some standard notations : @xmath28 is the energy displacement from threshold , @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the wavelength , and @xmath31 is the wave number . here the argument of @xmath25 is taken to be at the soft scale @xmath32 .",
    "the finite width @xmath8 of the bound state is taken into account by means of the substitution given in  ( [ eq : nrgy ] ) .",
    "the expression for the @xmath23 green function for the coulombic potential  ( [ eq : coul ] ) is given by    g_1(0,0,k ) = & & + = \\ { 2(k^2 - ^2 ) + } & & [ eq : green ] where @xmath33 is euler constant ( @xmath34 ) , and @xmath35 is the digamma function , @xmath36 .",
    "the derivative at the origin of  ( [ eq : green ] ) is obtained by the simple multiplicative relation .",
    "g_1(,,k ) |_=0,=0 = 9g_1(0,0,k ) .",
    "[ eq : diffgreen ]    some _ caveats _ ( as described in  @xcite ) have to be considered for the case of the @xmath37 wave . there exists a constant linear term in the decay width @xmath8 contributing to the @xmath23 green function that can not be properly computed in a purely nonrelativistic framework  @xcite .",
    "the term independent from @xmath38 that has to be added to the green function  ( [ eq : green ] ) is given by 0.185 [ eq : greenlin ] and from  @xcite the @xmath39 argument of the logarithmic term in  ( [ eq : green ] ) is given by @xmath40 by means of an analysis of relativistic perturbation theory .",
    "we note that the last two results have been obtained only for the top quark case , and we will assume that those results remain valid also for the stop quark which has a high mass , presumably close to that of the top quark .",
    "in any case the two aforementioned terms do not contribute much to the green function estimates , since they are dominated by the leading @xmath41 term of  ( [ eq : green ] ) .",
    "our analysis of the threshold behaviour of the cross section should hold for a range of mass values and decay widths . for the mass range we will refer to the current stop mass value limits  @xcite and the lep capabilities , while for the decay widths we have to take into account the formation requirements of the bound state  @xcite .",
    "a criterion for the formation of bound states is that the creation of a hadron can occur only if the level splitting which depends upon the strength of the strong force between the ( s)quarks and their relative distance  @xcite , is larger than the natural width of the state .",
    "this means that , if e_2p-1p [ eq : critde ] where @xmath42 and @xmath8 is the width of the would ",
    "be bound state , then the bound state exists .",
    "performing the analysis in this way allows us also to avoid dealing directly with several parameters of the mssm model which are relevant to stop quark decay ( apart from the stop mass ) , namely the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values @xmath43 , the higgs  higgsino mass parameter @xmath44 and the wino mass @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "the only constraint we have to impose is that the decay width be lower than about 1 gev , necessary for the scalar bound state creation  @xcite regardless of the values assumed for the parameters mentioned above .    as a first step",
    ", we check that the expression  ( [ eq : green ] ) used for our potential model  ( [ eq : coul ] ) is consistent with the born cross section for @xmath46 .",
    "we see in figure  ( [ fig : born ] ) that in the non interacting limit with @xmath47 the cross section given by  ( [ eq : green ] ) tends to the usual born expression , and is zero for @xmath48 .",
    "this confirms the consistency of the expression found in  ( [ eq : stopangle ] ) .    in figures  ( [ fig : green60],[fig : green100 ] ) we present the results of the threshold cross section for a lep mass range , @xmath49 .",
    "we have chosen the left ",
    "right mixing angle to be such that @xmath50 . from  ( [ eq : stopangle ] )",
    "it is possible to see that the cross section minimum value is obtained for @xmath51 at @xmath52 , the point where the @xmath16 boson coupling vanishes , which does not much differ from the maximal value .",
    "as previously stated , assuming the decay width to be smaller than 1 @xmath53 , we show for each chosen mass for widths of @xmath54 and 1 @xmath53 respectively .",
    "the cross sections are plotted against the threshold offset energy @xmath55 , the centre of mass energy being given by the relation @xmath56 .    for @xmath57 ,",
    "figure  ( [ fig : green60 ] ) shows the structure of the discrete energy levels for @xmath48 versus decay width values given above .",
    "the maximal height of the peak , about 8400 @xmath58 , is obtained for the smallest width of @xmath59 .",
    "the shape of the peaks are similar to the one obtained by the breit  wigner formula , except for the resonance tails that are set higher with increasing energy .",
    "the height of the peaks decreases drastically as the binding energy reaches asymptotically the @xmath60 level .",
    "they tend also to accumulate and merge towards the @xmath60 value as the energy increases ; this happens when the distance of the two resonance peaks is of the order of the decay width .",
    "for the coulombic model the binding energy of the @xmath23 level is given by the expression e_n = - , n>1 [ eq : energy ] and the resonance peaks merge when ^2 ~. [ eq : mpeaks ] this means that the the last visible peak has a quantum number @xmath61 given by ~ , [ eq : lastpeak ] we can see for instance in plot  ( [ fig : green60 ] ) that for @xmath62 the @xmath63 peak is already barely noticeable . for @xmath64 , the limiting region of bound state formation  @xcite , we see that there is no visible structure ; even the first peak is smeared by the large width .",
    "the continuum energy region @xmath65 does not present any fine structure , and remains essentially the same for any given decay width .",
    "one important effect to be noted is the large difference of the green function result with respect to the born prediction for @xmath46 .",
    "this fact is shown in figure  ( [ fig : born ] ) where the two estimates of the cross section are compared .",
    "it is clearly seen that the former is about one order of magnitude larger than the born cross section .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that the green function technique takes into account the interaction between the particles , and the contributions of the binding energies accumulate towards the @xmath60 energy level as described , thus affecting substantially the continuum region as well .    in figure  ( [ fig : green100 ] ) , we show the results for @xmath66 , with the same parameters given in figure  ( [ fig : green60 ] ) .",
    "the peaks are lower than the previous case , in particular the largest value of the cross section is obtained for @xmath67 at about 2400 @xmath58 .",
    "the position of the peaks are shifted towards lower values of the centre of mass energy because the binding energy given by the expression  ( [ eq : energy ] ) is higher .    for nlc energies , we present in figures  ( [ fig",
    ": green200 ] ) and  ( [ fig : green500 ] ) results obtained for @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively .",
    "the parameters have been chosen to be the same as of the lep case , and the qualitative behaviour of the threshold cross section is analogous . for @xmath68 ,",
    "the maximal value of the first peak obtained at @xmath70 is about 450 @xmath58 , while for @xmath69 the highest peak reaches only 90 @xmath58 .",
    "the position of the peaks is shifted towards even lower energy values because of still higher values of bound state binding energy , as can be verified from  ( [ eq : energy ] ) .",
    "we remark that all our results have been obtained for the coulombic potential  ( [ eq : coul ] ) .",
    "it is known that in the threshold region there are singular coulombic terms @xmath71 which spoil the finite order perturbation theory .",
    "the resummation of these contributions have been done ",
    "see  @xcite and references therein  and they give small contributions and only modify slightly the coulombic potential .",
    "the effect on the cross section is quite small , as can be seen from the plots in  @xcite , and does not change our estimates by more than a few percent .",
    "another point concerns the validity of the schrdinger green function method  ( [ eq : green ] ) .",
    "since it is a nonrelativistic procedure , we have to ensure that the velocity of the squarks is low enough in order to make relativistic corrections negligible . from kinematical arguments ,",
    "it is possible to give a bound for the maximal acceptable energy offset @xmath72 .",
    "assuming an upper value for the squark velocity , @xmath73 , and the expression  ( [ eq : beta ] ) together with the centre of mass energy parametrisation , @xmath74 , one obtains by means of a series expansion in @xmath55 e_max < _ max^2 .",
    "[ eq : emax ] in table  ( [ table : en ] ) we present some estimates on @xmath73 and @xmath72 for different squark masses and some lorentz @xmath75 parameter values .",
    "we see that the limit of validity for the nonrelativistic equation  ( [ eq : es ] ) lies in a range of a few @xmath53 around the threshold , and naturally increases with larger squark masses ; this can be intuitively understood since the heavier the squark is , the slower will it rotate inside the bound state  @xcite .",
    "the results obtained so far have to be folded with the beam energy spread of the collider . for the lep2 case , which has a beam energy spread of the order of 200 @xmath76  @xcite ,",
    "even if the peak cross section is in the @xmath77 range for @xmath57  ( [ fig : green60 ] ) the various resonance peaks are practically undetectable because their widths are much smaller than the typical beam energy spread ( see also the discussion of  @xcite ) .",
    "the sole possibility of a width larger than the beam energy spread , @xmath64 case , as already discussed , has no peaks as they have been smeared and thus no visible fine structure is envisaged .",
    "the situation does not change for the value of @xmath78 ; as we can see from figure  ( [ fig : green100 ] ) this situation is essentially the same as the previous one , and the peak cross section is even smaller than the former by a multiplicative factor of about 4 .    with the increase of the centre of mass energy ( nlc case )",
    "the net result for the cross section detection is even worse than before .",
    "the beam energy spread is of the order of 6 @xmath53  @xcite and , as seen clearly from figures  ( [ fig : green200 ] ) and  ( [ fig : green500 ] ) , it is even larger than the energy range used for the plots by a factor of 4 , thus making impossible the detection of any possible fine structure present in the threshold cross section .",
    "in this letter , we have shown that the bound state effect on the threshold cross section of a scalar stop bound state is not negligible , at least for the case of a coulombic potential .",
    "this effect turns out to be also dramatically different from the simple born cross section results for @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "however , because of the large beam energy spread of the present ( lep2 ) and future ( nlc ) @xmath1 colliders , the possible structure of the cross section at threshold can not be resolved .",
    "this confirmes our less refined breit",
    " wigner approach of  @xcite , and reinforces our previous result that the stoponium can not be detected at the present and even future @xmath1 colliders .",
