    "the shell - like supernova remnant ( snr ) g266.21.2 ( also known as rx  j0852.04622 , or `` vela junior '' ) at the south - east corner of the vela snr was discovered by aschenbach ( 1998 ) in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey data .",
    "possible detection of the 1.156 mev @xmath3-ray line of the radioactive isotope @xmath4ti ( half - life @xmath5 yr ) with the compton gamma - ray observatory ( iyudin et al . 1998 ) may imply a very young snr age of @xmath6 yr , at a distance of @xmath7 pc .",
    "aschenbach , iyudin , & schnfelder ( 1999 ) estimated upper limits of 1100 yr for the age , and 500 pc for the distance .",
    "observations with _ asca _ ( tsunemi et al . 2000 ; slane et al . 2001 ) demonstrate that the x - ray spectra of the snr shell are nonthermal .",
    "fits of these spectra with a power - law ( pl ) model yield a hydrogen column density substantially higher than that for the vela snr , implying a plausible distance to the remnant of 12 kpc , and an age of a few thousand years .",
    "aschenbach ( 1998 ) suggests that g266.21.2 was created by a core - collapse supernova that left a compact remnant  a neutron star ( ns ) or a black hole ( bh ) .",
    "three compact remnant candidates have been reported from the observations with _ rosat _ ( aschenbach 1998 ; aschenbach et al .",
    "1999 ) , _ asca _ ( slane et al .",
    "2001 ) , and _ beppo - sax _ ( mereghetti 2001 ) .",
    "pavlov et al.(2001 ) observed g266.21.2 with the _ chandra _",
    "advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) and found only one bright x - ray source , cxou j085201.4461753 ( j0852 hereafter ) , close to the snr center .",
    "they measured the source position with accuracy better than @xmath8 and proved that j0852 is not an x - ray counterpart of bright optical stars in the field .",
    "follow - up optical observations ( pavlov et al .",
    "2001 ; mereghetti , pelizzoni , & de luca 2002a ) revealed an object located only @xmath9 south - west of the j0852 .",
    "the colors of the optical source are consistent with those of a main sequence star at a distance of 1.52.5 kpc ; most likely , this is a field star . the limiting optical magnitudes at the position of the x - ray source ( @xmath10 , @xmath11  pavlov et al .  2001 ; @xmath12 , @xmath13  mereghetti et al .",
    "2002a ) rule out the possibility that the x - ray source is an agn .",
    "the lack of variability combined with the x - ray spectral properties makes a cataclysmic variable interpretation also implausible .",
    "the nature of the source remains elusive , although an isolated cooling ns or a ns with a `` fallback '' disk seem to be possible interpretations .",
    "the large frame time , 3.24 s , of the previous snapshot ( 3 ks ) acis observation made it impossible to search for short periods and led to strong saturation ( pile - up ) of the source image , precluding an accurate spectral analysis . to search for pulsations from the compact source and obtain a more accurate spectrum , we observed j0852 with _",
    "acis with a time resolution of 2.85 ms .",
    "we present the results of this observation in  2 and discuss the nature of the source in  3 .",
    "j0852 was observed with acis - s3 in continuous clocking ( cc ) mode on 2001 august 30 ( 31.5 ks total exposure ) .",
    "cc mode allows one to achieve time resolution of 2.85 ms at the expense of spatial information in one dimension .",
    "there were no substantial `` background flares '' during the observation , so we do not exclude any time intervals from the analysis . for data reduction and analysis , we used ciao 2.2.1 ( caldb 2.7 ) and xspec v.11.0 .",
    "the fwhm of the one - dimensional ( 1-d ) source image is @xmath14 , consistent with the acis point spread function .",
    "no evidence for excess emission around the point source is seen above the background of 0.013 counts s@xmath15 per @xmath16 segment of the 1-d image ( equivalent to an average surface brightness of 0.025 counts ks@xmath15 arcsec@xmath17 ) .      for the spectral analysis",
    ", we extracted 11,450 source - plus - background counts from a @xmath18 segment of the 1-d image .",
    "the background was taken from two adjacent @xmath19 segments .",
    "the background - subtracted source count rate is @xmath20 counts s@xmath15 .",
    "figure  1 shows the pulse - height spectrum in the 0.68.0 kev band , grouped into 77 bins with @xmath21 source counts per bin .",
    "we ignored all counts below 0.6 kev for spectral fitting because of the poorly known acis response at lower energies .    fitting the spectrum with a power - law ( pl ) model yields a large photon index @xmath22 ( all uncertainties at a @xmath23 confidence level ) , and a hydrogen column density @xmath24 @xmath25 , close to the total galactic hi column density in this direction , @xmath26 cm@xmath17 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ; estimated with the w3nh tool[multiblock footnote omitted ] ) .",
    "the quality of the fit is so poor ( @xmath28 for 74 degrees of freedom [ d.o.f . ] ) that this model can be rejected .",
    "thermal plasma emission models ( thermal bremsstrahlung and mekal with solar abundances ) also do not fit the observed spectrum ( @xmath29 and 14.26 for 74 d.o.f .",
    ", respectively ) .    on the contrary , a single blackbody ( bb ) model fits the spectrum reasonably well ( @xmath30 for 74 d.o.f .",
    "; see fig .  1 ) .",
    "it yields a temperature @xmath31 mk ( @xmath32 ev ) and a radius of equivalent emitting sphere @xmath33 km , where @xmath34 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity is @xmath35 ergs s@xmath15 .",
    "the hydrogen column density , @xmath36 , considerably exceeds the highest value , @xmath37 , found by lu & aschenbach ( 2000 ) for the vela snr .",
    "it indicates that the source is substantially more distant than the vela pulsar ( @xmath38 pc  caraveo et al .",
    "2001 ) . adding a pl component to the bb model",
    "only marginally improves the fit ( @xmath39 for 72 d.o.f .",
    ", vs.  1.130 for 74 d.o.f , for a single bb ) .",
    "the f - test shows that the reduction of @xmath40 caused by adding the pl component is significant only at a 66@xmath41 confidence level",
    ".    fits with the magnetic hydrogen ns atmosphere models ( pavlov et al.1995 ) give a lower effective temperature ( @xmath42 ev ) and a larger emitting area ( @xmath43 km ) . in both bb and",
    "h atmosphere fits , the inferred radius is much smaller than the expected ns radius , and the temperature is too high to interpret the detected x - rays as emitted from the whole surface of a uniformly heated isolated ns of a reasonable age .    to constrain the temperature of the entire ns surface",
    ", we fit the spectrum with a two - component bb model .",
    "the fits to the _ asca _ spectra of the outer , brighter parts of the snr give a range of hydrogen column densities from @xmath44 to @xmath45 cm@xmath17 ( slane et al .",
    "2001 ) . to find a conservative upper limit on the surface temperature @xmath46 , we fix the column density at @xmath47 , add a soft bb component with @xmath48 km , and fit @xmath49 and @xmath50 at different values of @xmath46 , increasing @xmath46 until the fit probability falls to 0.1% .",
    "this gives an upper limit @xmath51 ev , at a 99.9% confidence level .",
    "if we fix the column density at @xmath52 ( as obtained for the single bb fit ) , the limit becomes as low as @xmath53 ev .",
    "although we find no strong spectral lines , there is a hint of a spectral feature at 1.68 kev ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this feature persists when the data are rebinned with different numbers of counts per bin .",
    "we see no anomalies in the data which could explain the feature as an artifact .",
    "in particular , we have ruled out that the feature could be caused by anomalously high values in the bias map for s3 chip ( p.  ford 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "the shape of the feature resembles the so - called inverse p - cygni profile , which might be associated with accretion .",
    "its width , @xmath54 ev , might correspond to velocities of accreting material @xmath55 ; however , this width is comparable with the spectral resolution of acis - s3 around 1.7 kev ( _ chandra _",
    "proposers observatory guide , v.3.0 ,  6.7 ) .",
    "the feature is not seen in the background ( snr ) spectrum .      for timing analysis",
    ", we extracted 10,957 photons from a @xmath56 segment centered on j0852 ( @xmath57 @xmath58 of these counts are expected to come from the point source ) .",
    "the time span of the observation is @xmath59  ks .",
    "we corrected the event times for telescope dither and science instrument module motion using the approach described by zavlin et al .",
    "we transformed the corrected times to the solar system barycenter using the axbary tool of ciao .",
    "we used the @xmath60 test ( buccheri et al . 1983 ) to search for periodic pulsations .",
    "we calculated @xmath60 for @xmath615 ( where @xmath62 is the number of harmonics included ) at @xmath63 equally spaced frequencies @xmath64 in the 0.001100 hz range .",
    "this corresponds to oversampling by a factor of about 30 , compared to the expected width of @xmath65 @xmath66hz of the @xmath67 peaks , and guarantees that we miss no peaks .",
    "the two most significant peaks we found are at @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ms ) and @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ms ) .",
    "the most significant @xmath72 values , @xmath73 for the 301 ms period and @xmath74 for the 33 ms period , correspond to 96.7% and 96.8% significance levels , respectively , for the number of independent trials @xmath75 .",
    "the pulsed fractions obtained from the pulse profiles are @xmath76 and @xmath77 for the 301 ms and 33 ms period candidates , respectively . because of the low significance , we consider 13% as an upper limit for the pulsed fraction .",
    "to search for variability on larger time scales , we binned the data into 200  s bins .",
    "using the kolmogorov - smirnov test , the hypothesis that the observed numbers of counts in the bins come from a poisson distribution ( with the mean of 69.756 counts per bin ) can not be rejected at a @xmath78 confidence level .",
    "we have also used the fourier transform and found no periodic signal with a pulsed fraction larger than 12% in 110 mhz frequency range .",
    "therefore , we find no evidence for long - term variability in the data .",
    "the x - ray data and optical limits indicate that j0852 is the compact remnant ( ns or bh ) of the supernova explosion .",
    "the x - ray spectral properties and the lack of radio emission ( duncan & green 2000 ) suggest that j0852 is not an active pulsar .",
    "furthermore , the _ chandra _ observations show no sign of a pulsar - wind nebula ( pwn ) around the point source . from the 3 ks observation in timed exposure mode ( pavlov et al .",
    "2001 ) , the @xmath79 upper limit on the pwn brightness ( in counts arcsec@xmath17 ) can be estimated as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 counts arcsec@xmath17 is the background surface brightness , and @xmath82 is the ( unknown ) pwn area . scaling the area as @xmath83 arcsec@xmath84 ( which corresponds to the transverse size of about @xmath85 cm ) and assuming a pl spectrum with a photon index @xmath862 , we obtain an upper limit of ( 1.3@xmath87 erg s@xmath15 on the pwn luminosity in the 0.210 kev band , for @xmath88 in the range of 1.45.3 .",
    "the observational properties of j0852 strongly resemble those of the other radio - quiet central compact objects ( ccos ) in snrs ( see pavlov et al .",
    "2002a for a review ) , particularly the cco in the snr cas a ( murray et al .  2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "at least one of these sources , 1e 1207.45209 , has been proven to be a ns rotating with a period of 424 ms ( zavlin et al .",
    "2000 ; pavlov et 2002b ) . a number of possible interpretations of ccos",
    "have been recently discussed by several authors ( e.g. pavlov et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 , 2002a ; chakrabarty et al .",
    "2001 ) . the limits on x - ray - to - optical flux ratio for j0852 and the cas a cco virtually rule out models which involve accretion onto a ns or a bh from a binary companion .",
    "if these are accreting objects , a more plausible source of accreting matter might be a `` fossil disk '' , left over after the sn explosion ( van paradjis , taam , & van den heuvel 1995 ) .",
    "alternatively , thermal emission from an isolated , cooling ns could explain the observational results .",
    "we discuss these two options below .",
    "if j0852 is an accreting ns , the observed luminosity , @xmath89 erg s@xmath15 , could be due to a rather low accretion rate , @xmath90 g  s@xmath15 , where @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "the accreting matter could be supplied from a fossil ( `` fallback '' ) disk .",
    "the formation of such a disk from the ejecta produced by a sn explosion was discussed by a number of authors ( e.g. marsden , lingenfelter , & rothschild 2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "some models suggest that a fossil disk can be formed several days after the sn explosion ( `` prompt '' disk ) and range from @xmath93 to @xmath94 , while others suggest that the disk can be formed later , years after the sn explosion ( `` delayed '' disk ) .",
    "the details of the formation mechanism and the disk properties are highly uncertain , and , consequently , the accretion rate @xmath95 is also poorly constrained , but the required value of @xmath96 g s@xmath15 is low enough not to exhaust the disk at any reasonable age of j0852 .",
    "the accretion onto a ns can proceed in two different regimes ( e.g. , frank , king , & raine 1992 ) , depending on the relation between the corotation radius , @xmath97 cm , and the magnetospheric radius , @xmath98 cm , where @xmath99 is the ns spin period , @xmath100 g is the magnetic field at the ns surface , and @xmath101 . if @xmath102 , the infalling material is stopped at the magnetospheric radius and expelled as a wind due to centrifugal force . in this `` propeller regime '' ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) ,",
    "x - ray emission is mainly due to optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung produced in the flow ( wang & robertson 1985 ) .",
    "since the thermal bremsstrahlung model does not fit the observed spectrum , we consider this case unlikely .    if @xmath103 ( i.e. , @xmath104 s , or @xmath105 g ) , the accreting matter is able to reach the ns surface . at extremely low magnetic fields , @xmath106 g ,",
    "when the magnetospheric radius is smaller than the ns radius , a hot layer is formed at the boundary between the accretion disk and the ns surface ( e.g. , frank et al .  1992 ) . since this boundary layer",
    "is expected to be optically thin at @xmath107 g  s@xmath15 ( inogamov & sunyaev 1999 ) , its radiation can not explain the observed bb spectrum . at reasonable magnetic fields , @xmath108 g ( @xmath109 ) , the accretion flow is channeled onto the ns poles , producing hot spots of radius @xmath110 km .",
    "the observed size and temperature of the bb - like radiation are consistent with being emitted from such a cap at @xmath111 g. such an estimate requires a pulsar period @xmath112 s , much longer than our candidate periods .",
    "if we assume @xmath113 ms , the condition @xmath114 requires @xmath115 g and @xmath116 km , considerably larger than the size of emitting region , @xmath117 km , inferred from the bb fit .",
    "however , given the crudeness of the polar cap size estimate , which can be much smaller than adopted above ( see , e.g. , frank et al .",
    "1992 , and references therein ) , we can not rule out the candidate period of 301 ms based on the apparent inconsistency between @xmath118 and @xmath50 .",
    "thus , in the accretion hypothesis , j0852 could be a low - luminosity x - ray pulsar , presumably with a magnetic field much lower than those of binary x - ray pulsars , slowly accreting from a fossil disk .",
    "an argument against this interpretation is a lack of nonperiodic variability in the radiation from j0852 , which is commonly observed from accreting sources ( at least , x - ray binaries ) .",
    "on the other hand , variability could be found in further observations of this source .",
    "a direct confirmation of the accreting hypothesis would be detection of an accretion disk , which would require deep ir - optical observations with high angular resolution .",
    "one can also assume that j0852 is an isolated ( non - accreting ) ns emitting thermal radiation from its surface .",
    "the `` standard '' ns cooling models predict a luminosity of @xmath119@xmath120 erg s@xmath15 for a ns of 0.110 kyr age ( e.g. , tsuruta 1998 ) .",
    "the lower observed luminosity of j0852 could be interpreted as due to an accelerated cooling mechanism , but applicability of the cooling models to j0852 is questionable because the models assume a uniformly heated ns surface while the size of the emitting region obtained from the bb fit is only @xmath121 km .",
    "apparent sizes of the emitting regions much smaller than the canonical ns radius have been observed from other isolated nss ( pavlov et al .  2002a , c ) .",
    "in particular , the cas a cco shows a ( blackbody ) size of 0.3 km with a temperature of 0.6 kev ( pavlov et al .",
    "2000 ) , which hints that it is an object similar to j0852 , with a higher temperature possibly due to its younger age .",
    "pavlov et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggested a two - component thermal model for the cas  a cco , in which the observed x - rays are emitted from hydrogen polar caps of about 1 km radius and 0.24 kev effective temperature , while the rest of the ns surface is iron at a temperature of 0.15 kev , too cold to be observable because of strong interstellar absorption . in this model ,",
    "the polar caps are hotter because of the higher thermal conductivity of hydrogen .",
    "weaker ism absorption for j0852 allowed us to find a lower temperature limit for the cold component , @xmath122 ev , too low to explain the temperature difference by different chemical compositions .",
    "it should be mentioned that this limit is a factor of 1.4 lower than the temperature predicted by the so - called standard ( slow ) cooling model for a @xmath123 yrs old ns ( see , e.g. , fig .  4 in slane , helfand , & murray 2002 ) .",
    "this may indicate that if j0852 is a ns , it undergoes fast cooling , perhaps associated with direct urca processes in the ns core ( e.g. , yakovlev et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "hot spots on the ns surface could also be associated with a very strong magnetic field , @xmath124 g. due to anisotropic heat conductivity of the ns crust , the surface temperature is higher at the magnetic poles ( greenstein & hartke 1983 ; shibanov & yakovlev 1996 ) . to produce small hot spots , the surface magnetic field should be strongly nonuniform ( e.g. , an offset dipole or a quadrupole  page & sarmiento 1996 ) . fast decay of a superstrong magnetic field ( @xmath125 g ) could provide an additional source of polar cap heating ( thompson & duncan 1996 ; colpi , geppert & page 2000 ) . in such strong magnetic fields , electron - positron pair creation should be suppressed due to photon splitting ( baring & harding 2001 ) , which is consistent with the apparent lack of pulsar activity in j0852 .",
    "one can crudely estimate the magnetic field assuming that one of the two candidate periods , 33 ms or 301 ms , is the true period .",
    "if the initial period of the pulsar was much shorter than the current period , then the period derivative , rotation energy loss rate , and `` canonical '' magnetic field [ @xmath126 g ] , can be estimated as @xmath127^{-1}$ ] , @xmath128^{-1}$ ] erg  s@xmath15 , and @xmath129^{-1/2}$ ] g , where @xmath130 yr is the ns age , and @xmath131 is the braking index . assuming @xmath132 , ( close to that observed in young pulsars ) , we obtain , for @xmath133 ms , @xmath134 , @xmath135 erg  s@xmath15 , and @xmath136 g  parameters typical for a young , active pulsar , in apparent contradiction with observations .",
    "on the other hand , for the 301 ms period , we obtain @xmath137 , @xmath138 erg  s@xmath15 , and @xmath139 g. since the local magnetic field can be much higher than the canonical value ( e.g. , for an offset dipole ) , one can speculate that , for @xmath113 ms , it is high enough to explain the hot spot(s ) and the lack of radio - pulsar activity . if this hypothesis is correct , the j0852 could be a very young anomalous x - ray pulsar ( axp ) whose period will become of order 612 s ( as observed in axps ) when it grows older by a factor of 2040 .    however , there are considerable differences between the properties of axps and j0852 .",
    "contrary to axps , whose spectra contain both the bb and pl components of comparable luminosities ( mereghetti et al .",
    "2002b ) , the spectrum of j0852 fits well with a single bb model .",
    "the size of the emitting region in j0852 is substantially smaller ( 0.3 km vs.  0.75 km ) , and the temperature somewhat lower ( 0.4 kev vs.  0.40.6 kev ) , than those of axps .",
    "these differences ( particularly , the lack of a pl component in j0852 ) hint at different ns parameters .",
    "for instance , it is quite possible that none of the candidate periods is correct , and the true period is even longer than the axp periods . in this case",
    ", the magnetic field could be even higher than those adopted in the magnetar interpretation of axps  e.g. , @xmath140 g. such a strong field can inhibit not only the pair cascade , but also the emission of primary particles from the ns surface , which might explain the lack of particles in the ns magnetosphere ( hence , the lack of nonthermal radiation ) in j0852 . if the ns rotates sufficiently slow , @xmath141 s ,",
    "the critical parallel electric field required to pull out electrons from the ns surface , @xmath142 v cm@xmath15 ( usov & melrose 1995 ) , is higher than the maximum parallel electric field at the surface , @xmath144 v cm@xmath15 . on the other hand , the surface temperature , @xmath145 kev ,",
    "above which the thermoionic emission of electrons becomes efficient ( usov & melrose 1995 ) , grows with increasing magnetic field .",
    "( these estimates assume that the ns has no light - element [ e.g. , hydrogen ] atmosphere . ) therefore , a long period and a superstrong magnetic field might explain the lack of the pl tail in the spectrum of j0852 and other enigmatic ccos ( e.g. , in the cas a and pup a snrs ;   pavlov et al .",
    "2002a ) .    in summary ,",
    "the observations of j0852 can be explained assuming it is a ns .",
    "given the deep limiting optical magnitudes and the lack of nonperiodic variability , we consider the interpretation in terms of an isolated ns with a very strong magnetic field somewhat more plausible than the accretion models .",
    "further observations are required to confirm or reject this hypothesis . particularly important",
    "would be x - ray timing observations to measure the period unequivocally , high - resolution x - ray spectral observations to look for spectral features , and ir - optical observations to search for a ns counterpart ( e.g. , a fossil disk ) .",

    "<S> we observed the compact central object cxou j085201.4461753 in the supernova remnant g266.21.2 ( rx j0852.04622 ) with the _ chandra _ acis detector in timing mode . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of this object can be described by a blackbody model with the temperature @xmath0 ev and radius of the emitting region @xmath1 km , at a distance of 1  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> power - law and thermal plasma models do not fit the source spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum shows a marginally significant feature at 1.68 kev . </S>",
    "<S> search for periodicity yields two candidate periods , about 301 ms and 33 ms , both significant at a 2.1@xmath2 level ; the corresponding pulsed fractions are 13% and 9% , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find no evidence for long - term variability of the source flux , nor do we find extended emission around the central object . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that cxou j085201.4461753 is similar to cxou j232327.9 + 584842 , the central source of the supernova remnant cas a. it could be either a neutron star with a low or regular magnetic field , slowly accreting from a fossil disk , or , more likely , an isolated neutron star with a superstrong magnetic field . in either case , a conservative upper limit on surface temperature of a 10 km radius neutron star is about 90 ev , which suggests accelerated cooling for a reasonable age of a few thousand years . </S>"
