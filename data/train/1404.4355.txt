    "heavy - ion fusion reactions have been studied extensively over the past two decades .",
    "one of the early goals was to explain the barrier distributions that have been extracted from measurements @xcite .",
    "another interesting and somewhat related question is what is the influence of transfer .",
    "this issue was first raised by beckerman et al .",
    "@xcite who observed a large enhancement in the subbarrier fusion of @xmath6ni+@xmath7ni compared to an interpolation between the fusion cross sections for the two symmetric systems , @xmath6ni+@xmath6ni and @xmath7ni+@xmath7ni .",
    "a similar observation was made in the fusion of @xmath2ca+@xmath0ca @xcite which is strongly enhanced at subbarrier energies and suppressed at high energies compared to the expectation based on the fusion data for the two symmetric systems , @xmath0ca+@xmath0ca @xcite and @xmath2ca+@xmath2ca @xcite .",
    "it was realized early on that the influence of transfer on fusion can be large when the effective @xmath5 value for transfer is large and positive @xcite , as is the case for @xmath6ni+@xmath7ni and @xmath2ca+@xmath0ca .",
    "couplings to transfer channels with large negative @xmath5 values , on the other hand , are expected to have a much smaller effect .",
    "the coupling to such reaction channels results in an energy shift of the calculated cross section , due to an adiabatic renormalization of the ion - ion potential @xcite .",
    "however , it can be difficult to disentangle this effect from uncertainties in the ion - ion potential and the effect is therefore often ignored .",
    "a more recent observation is that fusion data are often hindered at extreme sub barrier energies @xcite when compared to coupled - channels calculations that use the standard or empirical woods - saxon potential which has been extracted from elastic scattering data @xcite .",
    "another observation is that the data are often suppressed at energies far above the coulomb barrier when compared to calculations that use the same potential @xcite .",
    "both phenomena and ways to explain them were discussed in a recent review of heavy - ion fusion reactions @xcite .",
    "excellent examples on all of the above phenomena are observed in the data for the fusion of @xmath2ca with @xmath1zr @xcite and @xmath0ca with @xmath1zr @xcite .",
    "the fusion data for @xmath2ca+@xmath4zr @xcite were recently supplemented with new measurements @xcite that went down to a lowest cross section of 2.4 @xmath8 1.7 @xmath9b .",
    "the data for this system are particularly interesting because they are strongly enhanced at subbarrier energies compared with the data of the other ca+zr systems .",
    "moreover , they do not show any sign of a fusion hindrance at the lowest energies .",
    "these features are ascribed to the influence of couplings to transfer channels which is expected to be strong because the effective @xmath5 values for one- and two - nucleon transfer are all positive .",
    "the influence of transfer on the fusion of @xmath0ca+@xmath4zr , on the other hand , is expected to be small because all of the effective @xmath5 values for transfer are large and negative .    in view of the complexity of the ca+zr fusion data , it is of great interest to perform a systematic coupled - channels calculations analysis of the fusion data for the four systems .",
    "the basic calculations presented here include couplings to one- and two - phonon excitations as well as mutual excitations of the low - lying surface modes in the reacting nuclei .",
    "more complex calculations that include couplings of up to three - phonon excitations and to one- and two - nucleon transfer channels are also performed .",
    "the motivation is to explore their influence on fusion and try to isolate the influence of transfer from other reaction channels .",
    "the simplest case of the four ca+zr systems mentioned above is possibly the fusion of @xmath0ca+@xmath4zr , primarily because the effective @xmath5 values for one- and two - nucleon transfer are all negative , and the influence of transfer is therefore expected to be weak .",
    "the fusion data for this system have already been explained fairly well by coupled - channels calculations @xcite that used the m3y+repulsion ( m3y+rep ) potential and included couplings to one- and two - phonon excitations of the low - lying surface modes .",
    "the potential was calculated using the double - folding technique @xcite which is also used in this work .    the nuclear densities of the two calcium isotopes that are used were determined previously in refs .",
    "@xcite by analyzing the fusion data for @xmath2ca+@xmath2ca @xcite and @xmath0ca+@xmath0ca @xcite .",
    "the nuclear density parameters of the two zr isotopes are determined by analyzing the data for the @xmath0ca induced fusion reactions with @xmath3zr and @xmath4zr that were measured by stefanini et al .",
    "@xcite . having determined these parameters , one can then predict the ion - ion potentials and the cross sections for the fusion of @xmath2ca with @xmath3zr and @xmath4zr .",
    "the quality of the predictions is tested by comparing to the data of timmers et al .",
    "@xcite and stefanini et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the basic ingredients of the coupled - channels technique are summarized in section ii .",
    "the analysis of the data for the @xmath0ca induced fusion with @xmath3zr and @xmath4zr is presented in section iii .",
    "the predicted cross sections for the fusion of @xmath2ca with the two zirconium isotopes are compared to the data in section iv , and section v contains the conclusions .",
    "the coupled - channels calculations that are presented are similar to those that were performed , for example , in the analysis of the fusion data for the calcium isotopes @xcite and for @xmath0ca+@xmath4zr @xcite .",
    "the main ingredients that are relevant to the discussion here are summarized below .",
    "the radii of the reacting nuclei are expressed as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the nuclear surface distortion , @xmath12 are the dynamic deformation amplitudes , and @xmath13 is a unit vector along the line between the centers of the reacting nuclei .    in this work",
    "the iso - centrifugal approximation @xcite is adopted in order to reduce the number of coupled equations .",
    "this approximation is equivalent to the rotating frame approximation @xcite in which the z - axis points along the direction of @xmath13 .",
    "the spherical harmonics that appear in eq .",
    "( [ rad ] ) can therefore be replaced by @xmath14 = @xmath15 .",
    "that implies that the magnetic quantum numbers of the reacting nuclei are conserved .",
    "since the magnetic quantum numbers of even - even nuclei are zero in the entrance channel , they will remain zero throughout the reaction .",
    "the off - diagonal matrix elements of the surface distortion , eq .",
    "( [ rad ] ) , that connect the ground state @xmath16 to an excited state @xmath17 in nucleus @xmath18 , has the following form in the rotating frame approximation ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the multipolarity of the excitation and @xmath21 is the deformation parameter .",
    "there are actually two types of deformation parameters , one associated with the nuclear induced excitation , @xmath22 , and one with coulomb excitation , @xmath23 .",
    "the nuclear induced excitations are generated in this work by an expansion of the nuclear field up to second order in the total nuclear surface distortion , @xmath24 = @xmath25 + @xmath26 .",
    "the nuclear interaction is therefore approximated by @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the ion - ion potential , which is the nuclear interaction in the entrance channel .",
    "the expression ( [ 2ndorder ] ) has been constructed in such a way that the ground state expectation value @xmath29 is identical to the ion - ion potential @xmath28 .",
    "the off - diagonal matrix elements of the nuclear interaction can be generated in the harmonic approximation from matrix elements of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ surf ] ) .",
    "the coulomb excitation is usually described by an expansion of the coulomb field up to first order in the surface deformation , because it has been shown by hagino et al .",
    "@xcite that higher - order corrections to the coulomb field can safely be ignored .",
    "the expression for the coulomb field is therefore @xcite , @xmath30 where @xmath31 = 1.20 @xmath32 is the coulomb radius of nucleus @xmath18 .",
    "matrix elements of the coulomb interaction ( [ coul ] ) are determined by matrix elements of the surface deformation @xcite , @xmath33 which are here expressed in terms of the coulomb deformation parameters @xmath34 .",
    "these parameters can be obtained from the so - called reduced transition probability @xmath35 that can be found , for example , in refs . @xcite .",
    "the relation between the two quantities is @xcite @xmath36    the nuclear deformation parameter @xmath37 is often assumed to be identical to the coulomb deformation parameter simply because other information is not available . however , the nuclear deformation parameters have in some cases been determined by analyzing the angular distributions for inelastic scattering .",
    "fusion data of lighter and medium heavy systems can often be explained fairly well by coupled - channels calculations that are based on the second - order nuclear ( [ 2ndorder ] ) and the first - order coulomb ( [ coul ] ) interactions and include up to two - phonon excitations .",
    "this model is also the starting point of the calculations performed in this work .",
    "however , it is necessary to consider higher - order couplings and include higher multiphonon excitations if one wants to explain the fusion data of heavy and soft systems ( see refs .",
    "@xcite . ) the influence of up to three - phonon excitations will therefore be explored but the expansion of the nuclear interaction , eq .",
    "( [ 2ndorder ] ) , will still be truncated at the second - order level .",
    "the fusion cross section is primarily determined by the ingoing flux obtained from the ingoing - wave boundary conditions that are imposed at the minimum of the pocket in the entrance channel potential .",
    "this definition is supplemented with the absorption in a weak and short - ranged imaginary potential , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the position of the pocket in the entrance channel potential .",
    "the diffuseness @xmath40 is set to 0.2 fm , whereas the strength @xmath41 is set to either 2 mev or 5 mev as explained in the description of the calculations .",
    "the strength of the short - ranged imaginary potential is not a serious issue when a standard woods - saxon potential is used because the calculated cross sections are relatively insensitive to the value of @xmath41 .",
    "it is a more delicate issue when the shallow m3y+rep potential is used .",
    "the coupled - channels calculations are based on the m3y+repulsion ( m3y+rep ) potential , the calculation of which is described in ref .",
    "the m3y potential alone , @xmath42 , is calculated using the double - folding expression , @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the nuclear densities of the reacting nuclei , and @xmath45 is the effective m3y ( direct + exchange ) interaction .",
    "the densities are parametrized in terms of the symmetrized fermi function introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite with a fixed diffuseness and an adjustable radius .",
    "the m3y potential @xmath46 is extremely deep for overlapping nuclei and it produces a pocket in the entrance channel potential that is deeper than the ground state energy of the compound nucleus .",
    "this unphysical condition is repaired by introducing a repulsive potential .",
    "the repulsive part @xmath47 of the m3y+rep potential @xcite , @xmath48 , is calculated from an expression that is similar to eq .",
    "( [ m3y ] ) , @xmath49 here the effective interaction @xmath50 is assumed to be a simple contact interaction , @xmath51 the nuclear densities @xmath52 that are used to calculate the repulsive potential , eq . ( [ rep ] ) , are assumed to have the same radii as those that are used to calculate the m3y potential , @xmath42 , but the diffuseness @xmath53 is different and is treated as an adjustable parameter @xcite .",
    "the strength of the repulsive interaction @xmath54 is calibrated ( once the radii and value of @xmath53 has been chosen ) to produce a nuclear incompressibility @xmath55 of the compound nucleus that is consistent with the values tabulated in the work of myers and ' swiatecki @xcite .",
    "the procedure is explained in detail in ref .",
    "there are therefore two adjustable parameters for each of the reacting nuclei , namely , the radius of the density and the diffuseness associated with the repulsive part of the interaction .",
    "while the height of the coulomb barrier is primarily determined by the radius parameter , the diffuseness parameter @xmath56 controls the thickness of the barrier and the depth of the pocket in the entrance channel potential .",
    "both parameters are adjusted to optimize the fit to the fusion data .",
    "this scheme was used in the analysis of the fusion data for the two symmetric systems , @xmath2ca+@xmath2ca @xcite and @xmath0ca+@xmath0ca @xcite , and the parameters of the densities that were obtained are shown in table ii .    by adopting the density of @xmath0ca that was obtained in a previous work @xcite one",
    "can now analyze the @xmath0ca+@xmath1zr fusion data and determine the density parameters of the two zirconium nuclei .",
    "actually , since the point - proton densities are fairly well known from electron scattering experiments , it is better to adopt these densities and instead calibrate the point - neutron densities to provide an optimum fit to the fusion data .",
    "the parameters that have been obtained are shown in table ii .",
    "the results suggest that both isotopes have a neutron skin , which is defined as the difference between the rms radii if the point - neutron and point - proton densities , @xmath57 as a consistency check of the analysis , one can compare the neutron skin thickness extracted from the fusion data to the values that have been obtained in other experiments .",
    "thus , if the extracted neutron skin is too thick , that would indicate that some of the couplings were too weak or that some important reaction channels were missing in the coupled - channels calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "if the extracted neutron skin is too thin , that would indicate that the coupling strengths to certain reaction channels were too strong .",
    "we have chosen in this work to compare the extracted neutron skin thikness to the values that have been obtained in anti - proton experiments @xcite .",
    "one reason is that systematic results have been obtained with this method for a wide range of nuclei .",
    "another reason is that the uncertainties of this method are not unreasonable in comparison to other methods . a better value could possibly be obtained by measuring the parity - violating asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons but that has not yet been achieved @xcite .",
    "the values of the neutron skin thickness obtained with different methods are compared in fig .",
    "@xcite for a @xmath58pb target .",
    "the figure shows that the anti - proton experiment @xcite ( @xmath59 = 0.15 @xmath8 0.02 fm ) is consistent with a measurement of the dipole polarizability obtained in inelastic proton scattering @xcite ( @xmath60 = 0.165 @xmath8 0.026 fm ) .",
    "the elastic proton scattering data give slightly larger values of the neutron skin thickness but a previous analysis at 800 mev @xcite gave a result ( @xmath60 = 0.14 @xmath8 0.04 fm ) that is close to the value of the anti - proton experiment .",
    "thus it appears that proton and anti - proton experiments are in fairly good agreement for @xmath58pb , and a similar result ( @xmath59 = 0.16 @xmath8 0.04 fm ) has also been obtained in ( @xmath61he,@xmath62 ) charge - exchange reactions @xcite .",
    "the parity - violating asymmetry experiment @xcite , on the other hand , gave a larger and more uncertain value , @xmath60 = @xmath63 fm .",
    "the deformation parameter for coulomb and nuclear induced excitations , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , are not always identical as discussed in sec .",
    "an example is the excitation of the calcium isotopes @xcite , where an analysis of the @xmath66o+@xmath67ca elastic and inelastic scattering data gave nuclear deformation parameters that were significantly smaller than the adopted values for coulomb excitation .",
    "the two types of deformation parameters are compared in table i in terms of the quantity @xmath68 which is just the matrix elements of the surface distortion , eq .",
    "the nuclear deformation parameters for the two zirconium isotopes are not known so they are assumed to be identical to the coulomb deformation parameters .",
    "the basic structure input to the calculations is summarized in table i. when excitations of multiphonon states are considered , it is assumed that the couplings to these states can be calculated in the harmonic oscillator model from the values of @xmath69 that describe the one - phonon excitation .",
    "it must be emphasized that this approximation may not always be realistic and the calculations that include multiphonon excitations may therefore be uncertain .",
    "the basic two - phonon calculation includes one- and two - phonon excitations of the low - lying @xmath70 and @xmath71 states in projectile and target , as well as mutual excitations of these states .",
    "that results in a total of 15 channels ( including the elastic ) and is referred to as the ch-15 calculation .",
    "the @xmath72 state in @xmath0ca is relatively weak and is ignored .",
    "the @xmath72 excitation in @xmath3zr is stronger but it is combined with the 3@xmath73 excitation in the same nucleus into one effective @xmath71 channel .",
    "the basic two - phonon calculation performed for the @xmath0ca induced fusion with @xmath3zr and @xmath74zr are therefore ch-15 calculations and they are reported in section iii .",
    "the @xmath72 excitation in @xmath2ca is relatively strong and it is therefore included explicitly in the calculations of the @xmath2ca induced fusion reactions with the zirconium isotopes . on the other hand , the two - phonon excitations of the @xmath70 states in projectile and target are relatively weak and they are therefore ignored , and so is the two - phonon excitation of the @xmath72 state . the basic two - phonon calculation ( that includes mutual excitations )",
    "has 18 coupled channels , and the results of this ch-18 calculation are reported in section iv .",
    "the sensitivity to multiphonon excitations is investigated by considering the effect of up to three - phonon excitations .",
    "these calculations are not meant to be complete because the number of channels can easily become very large .",
    "the detailed calculations are described in sections iii and iv .",
    "the effective @xmath5 value for transfer reactions is defined in terms of the true @xmath5 value @xcite , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is difference in the height of the coulomb barrier in the entrance and in the exit channel .",
    "the general experience is that couplings to transfer reactions with positive effective @xmath5 values can have a strong effect and enhance the subbarrier fusion cross section @xcite , whereas the effect of transfer channels with large negative @xmath5 values is weaker and leads to an adiabatic renormalization of the ion - ion potential @xcite .",
    "the effective @xmath5 values for the most favorable one- and two - nucleon transfer reactions in ca+zr collisions are shown in table iii .",
    "they are all negative for @xmath0ca+@xmath4zr and couplings to transfer channels were ignored in the previous work @xcite but they will be considered in this work .",
    "the effective @xmath5 values for some of the other isotope combinations are positive and their influence on fusion will therefore be considered .",
    "the effective @xmath5 values for pair - transfer are particularly large and positive in @xmath2ca+@xmath4zr collisions and the influence of pair - transfer is expected to play an important role in the fusion of this system .",
    "the influence of transfer reactions is described by the model introduced in ref .",
    "the model assumes that excitations and transfer are independent degrees of freedom .",
    "the two - nucleon transfer is treated both as a direct and a successive process .",
    "the direct two - nucleon ( or pair ) transfer is described by the monopole form factor @xcite , @xmath77    the parameters of the one - nucleon transfer channels are specified later on for each of the four systems .",
    "it is unfortunately not feasible to consider all transfer channels .",
    "the choice of the transfer mode considered , either proton or neutron , is therefore made according to which transfer mode has the larger @xmath5 value for pair - transfer .",
    "the strength of the pair - transfer , @xmath78 , is adjusted in each case to optimize the fit of the calculated cross section to the fusion data .",
    "this empirical approach is adopted here because the pair transfer strength is not always known .",
    "the approach could be misleading because the adjusted strength could very well simulate the effect of couplings to other reaction channels that are not included explicitly in the calculation .",
    "on the other hand , if the cross sections for one- and two - nucleon transfer were known experimentally , one could calibrate the strengths of the transfer couplings so that the transfer data were reproduced as it was done in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the influence on fusion of a particular reaction channel is primarily determined by the @xmath5 value of the reaction and by the strength of the coupling at the coulomb barrier according to the constant coupling model of dasso et al . @xcite .",
    "the influence of the direct two - nucleon transfer is therefore expected to be stronger than the influence of one - nucleon transfer because the pair - transfer form factor , eq .",
    "( [ 2ptr ] ) , is short ranged and relatively large at the coulomb barrier , whereas the one - nucleon transfer form factor has a longer range and is relatively weak at the location of the coulomb barrier .",
    "the cross section for one - nucleon transfer may very well be larger than the cross section for the two - nucleon transfer but that does not necessarily imply that the one - nucleon transfer has a large impact on fusion .",
    "the couplings to one- and two - nucleon transfer are included in the coupled - channels calculations as described in the model of ref .",
    "the model assumes as mentioned earlier that excitations and transfer are independent degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , if there are 15 elastic and inelastic channels in the entrance channel mass partition , then the number is 30 channels ( ch-30 ) when one - nucleon transfer is included , and 45 channels ( ch-45 ) when both one - and two - nucleon transfer is considered .",
    "the @xmath0ca+@xmath1zr fusion data @xcite are analyzed by coupled - channels calculations that use the m3y+rep , double - folding potential .",
    "the nuclear density of @xmath0ca was determined previously @xcite by analyzing the @xmath0ca+@xmath0ca fusion data @xcite and it is used here to determine the densities of the two zirconium isotopes that provide the best fit to the @xmath0ca+@xmath1zr fusion data .",
    "the repulsive part of the m3y+rep interaction is calibrated to produce the incompressibilities @xmath55 = 227.9 and 223.7 mev , respectively , that are predicted for the two compound nuclei , @xmath79nd and @xmath80nd @xcite .",
    "the overall systematic uncertainty of the experiment @xcite is 14% , whereas the relative errors are mainly determined by statistics . a systematic error of 5% is therefore adopted in the @xmath81 analysis of the data .",
    "the data are also analyzed by adopting the standard woods - saxon parametrization of the ion - ion potential @xcite .",
    "the best fit to the data is achieved by adjusting the radius of the woods - saxon well .",
    "some of the results are reported here because they provide useful information when compared to the results obtained with the m3y+rep potential .",
    "thus a large value of the @xmath82 obtained with the woods - saxon potential may indicate a hindrance of the fusion data at very low energies , as discussed by jiang et al .",
    "@xcite , or a suppression of the fusion data at high energies , as discussed by newton et al . @xcite .",
    "the @xmath82 is expected to be smaller when the m3y+rep potential is used because this potential usually resolves the discrepancies with the data both at very low and very high energies @xcite . however , the situation is not always so straightforward because there are other issues that can play a role , for example , the influence of couplings to multiphonon excitations and transfer reactions .",

    "<S> the neutron densities of the zirconium isotopes are adjusted to optimize the fit to the fusion data , whereas the proton densities are determined by electron scattering experiments . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the fusion data can be explained fairly well by including couplings to one- and two - phonon excitations of the reacting nuclei and to one- and two - nucleon transfer reactions but there is also some sensitivity to multiphonon excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron skin thicknesses extracted for the two zirconium isotopes are consistent with anti - proton measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the densities of the zirconium isotopes are used together with the previously determined nuclear density of @xmath2ca to calculate the m3y+repulsion potentials and predict the fusion cross sections of @xmath2ca+@xmath1zr . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted cross sections for @xmath2ca+@xmath3zr are in reasonable agreement with the data when the influence of multiphonon excitations and a modest transfer is considered . </S>",
    "<S> the prediction of the @xmath2ca+@xmath4zr fusion cross section , on the other hand , is poor and under - predicts the data by 30 to 40% . </S>",
    "<S> although couplings to transfer channels with positive @xmath5 values were expected to play an important role , they are not able to explain the data , primarily because the predicted coulomb barrier is about 1.5 mev too high . possible reasons for this failure are discussed . </S>"
