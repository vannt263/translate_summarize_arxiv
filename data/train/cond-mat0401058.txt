    "a quantum point contact ( qpc ) is one of the reference systems of mesoscopic physics .",
    "the experimental discovery of conductance quantizaton @xcite triggered further research which contributed much to our modern understanding of nanoscience .",
    "qpc is a constriction defined in a 2deg by gates .",
    "the width of the constriction can be changed by the voltage applied to these gates . in the adiabatic regime , if the distance between the gates changes slowly compared to the wavelength of an electron , the theoretical description is readily obtained @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional motion of an electron confined between the gates is equivalent to _ one - dimensional _ scattering of an electron at a potential barrier .",
    "the height of the barrier is different for different transport channels .",
    "semi - classically , the electron is fully transmitted if its energy exceeds the top of the barrier in a given channel , and is fully reflected otherwise .",
    "thus , semi - classical transmission eigenvalues of a qpc are strongly degenerate : one has a finite number of transmission eigenvalues equal to one and an infinite number of transmission eigenvalues equal to zero .",
    "this picture would manifest experimentally in the precise quantization of conductance as a function of gate voltage .    in real experiments ,",
    "this degeneracy is lifted .",
    "a brief glance at any of many available experimental studies shows that conductance does not rise in ideal steps .",
    "the question whether the transmission eigenvalues are degenerate is also important for a number of other reasons .",
    "for instance , if a qpc is prepared in a superconducting material , discrete subgap ( andreev ) states develop @xcite .",
    "these states describe quasiparticles localized around qpc .",
    "the number of these states equals the number of transport channels , and their energies are expressed via transmission eigenvalues @xmath0 , @xmath1 , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 being the superconducting gap and the phase difference across the qpc .",
    "if the transmission eigenvalues are degenerate , the andreev levels are also degenerate .",
    "thus , any small perturbation would lift this degeneracy and produce a number of states with very close energies .",
    "such a perturbation would then drastically affect properties of the system .",
    "an obvious candidate for this degeneracy lifting is quantum tunneling across the top of the barrier .",
    "indeed , for a given energy there is a range of gate voltages when _ one _ transport channel has a transmission eigenvalue between zero and one  a partially open channel .",
    "all other transmission eigenvalues are also modified by the quantum tunneling : they get an exponentially small correction .",
    "thus , quantum tunneling leads to the rounding of the conductance steps as a function of gate voltage , but only provides exponentially small splitting of andreev states .    in this paper ,",
    "we study how the degeneracy of transmission eigenvalues is lifted by the scattering on impurities , which are always present in and around the qpc .",
    "properties of a disordered qpc have been investigated ( see refs . ) , mostly in relation to the disorder smearing of conductance steps or evolution of conductance fluctuations in ballistic regime .",
    "in contrast to the previous literature , we investigate the case when the conductance of the qpc is only slightly modified by the impurities , or , in other words , the impurity - related splitting of transmission eigenvalues is much less than one .",
    "this regime is realized for low concentration of impurities . in this situation",
    "we can disregard quantum effects like resonant tunneling through impurity states or kondo effect .",
    "our main result is that in this regime , reflection amplitudes are gaussian distributed with zero average and second - order correlation function which does not depend on the channel index .",
    "this provides us with a new class of random matrix theory .",
    "the results for the distribution function of transmission eigenvalues are universal  they only depend on the number of transport channels and on the average reflection eigenvalue .",
    "all other information can be extracted from these two parameters .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section [ model ]",
    "we treat a disordered qpc in the adiabatic approximation . in section [ correl ]",
    "we introduce the scattering matrix and show that in the expansion up to the second order in disorder potential closed channels do not contribute to the properties of transmission eigenvalues of open channels .",
    "section [ scat ] finalizes the quantum - mechanical calculation of reflection coefficient and conductance of a disordered qpc .",
    "we then turn to the classical ( boltzmann equation ) consideration , which facilitates the consideration of the diffusive regime ( section [ boltzmann ] ) .    in section [ noise ]",
    "we discuss noise properties of disordered qpc .",
    "finally , section [ distrib ] is devoted to the distribution function of transmission eigenvalues .",
    "for one open transport channel , we calculate this distribution function analytically by performing the disorder averaging directly . in the limit of large number of open channels",
    ", we obtain the distribution function by means of the circuit theory @xcite , which presents a disordered qpc as a pure qpc and a diffusive resistor connected in series . for intermediate numbers of open channels ,",
    "we perform a numerical simulation based on random matrix theory .",
    "we describe the qpc as a constriction between two infinitely high walls @xcite separated by the distance @xmath4 ( figure 1 )",
    ". a more physical model would take into account that the transverse profile is not sharp @xcite .",
    "since in this paper we employ semi - classical approximation ( do not discuss the rounding of conduction steps ) , the results do not depend on the details of the potential profile .",
    "for this reason , we use the simpler model .",
    "the schrdinger equation , @xmath5\\psi(x , y)=e\\psi(x , y),\\ ] ] is supplemented by the boundary conditions , @xmath6 here @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the single impurity potential , and the sum is taken over impurity positions .",

    "( [ s2 ] ) is the generalization of the equations previously written in refs . to the case of disordered qpc .    in the semi - classical ( wkb )",
    "approximation , in the absence of disorder , for each transport channel , electrons with the energies above ( below ) the top of the barrier are perfectly transmitted ( reflected ) .",
    "this approximation breaks down if the energy of an electron coincides with the top of the barrier . in this paper",
    ", we do not consider this case .",

    "we proceed by introducing the scattering matrix , @xmath17 which is unitary , @xmath18 , due to the current conservation requirement . at zero temperature , conductance of the system",
    "is expressed via landauer formula , @xmath19 where @xmath0 ( of interest in this paper ) are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the conductance quantum . without impurities ,",

    "it is more convenient to investigate the matrix @xmath25 , with the eigenvalues ( _ reflection eigenvalues _ ) @xmath26 . in the following ,",
    "we calculate the correction to the transmission eigenvalue @xmath27 due to disorder . for this purpose",
    ", we consider the perturbation expansion of the reflection matrix @xmath28 up to the second order in the disorder potential , @xmath29 let us now separate open and closed channels , @xmath30 where the submatrices @xmath31 , @xmath32 describe reflection from / to channels of different type ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 stand for open and closed ) .",
    "the reflection eigenvalues are found from the secular equation , @xmath35 , or , equivalently , @xmath36 we now expand this equation in powers of the disorder potential . for _ open channels _ ,",
    "the reflection eigenvalues @xmath37 are expected to be of the second order in disorder .",
    "we use now the identity @xmath38 and expand the first determinant taking into account that @xmath39 .",
    "the terms of zeroth order in the disorder potential cancel , since @xmath40 .",
    "terms of the first order do not appear , and in the second order one has @xmath41 .",
    "thus , closed channels have no effect on transmission of open channels . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we drop the subscript @xmath42 and operate only with the quantities related to open channels .",
    "elements of the matrix @xmath28 are random quantities . in the next section ,",
    "we characterize their statistical properties .",
    "we show that they are gaussian distributed with zero average .",
    "thus , it is enough to specify the correlation functions @xmath43 where the average is performed with respect to disorder .",
    "we show that the only non - zero correlator is @xmath44 , which is the probability for an electron coming in the open channel @xmath45 to be scattered to the open channel @xmath46 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the result does not depend on the indices @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we then relate this reflection probability with the correction to the conductance .",
    "thus , the set of eigenvalues @xmath27 describing _ open channels _ is obtained by diagonalizing the _ finite - size _ random matrix @xmath47 .",
    "this matrix is gaussian , and depends only on one parameter  average reflection coefficient .",
