    "there are no direct observations to guide us , and so we are required to make use of further input , of principles that are strong enough to support a large theoretical edifice .",
    "a well - known example for the theoretical derivation of new microscopic degrees of freedom from an underlying principle is the electroweak theory .",
    "one of its motivations was a well - defined description of @xmath0-decay , a reaction of four particles ( seen at least via the energy carried away in the case of the neutrino ) .",
    "as a pointlike interaction between the four particles involved , the perturbative quantum field theoretical description does not lead to well - defined decay rates . a new principle , renormalizability , is used to look for a more suitable theoretical framework .",
    "its implementation requires the inclusion of new quantum degrees of freedom , the exchange bosons of the electroweak theory .",
    "based on the principle of renormalizability , they were predicted theoretically well before direct observations by particle accelerators became possible .    in quantum gravity",
    ", we are currently in a situation similar to that before the direct detection of the exchange bosons .",

    "one may decide to use those already tried and true , such as renormalizability in this case leading to string theory ( as per current understanding ) . in this way , a quantization of gravitational ( and other , unified ) excitations on space - time becomes possible .",
    "there are , however , difficulties in the description of strong gravitational fields , as we find them at the big bang or in black holes .",
    "the interaction of matter with the space - time structure is relevant in those regimes , and so we must consider the quantum nature of full space - time . while this is not impossible in string theory ,",
    "the theory s setup makes the analysis of such questions rather indirect .",
    "an alternative principle offers itself , based on what we know about regimes of strong gravitational fields : the principle of background independence .",
    "it states the requirement of quantizing the full metric @xmath1 known as the representative of space - time geometry as it must emerge at large distances or low energies ; it is not enough to just quantize perturbations @xmath2 on a given ( e.g.minkowskian ) background where @xmath3 .",

    ". it may be possible to find observables insensitive to which @xmath4 is used , but this would be difficult to achieve and to demonstrate .",
    "moreover , regimes of strong gravitational fields , especially near classical singularities , do not allow a perturvative treatment with a small @xmath2 : the metric becomes degenerate , and so at least some of the crucial components of @xmath2 are as large as those of @xmath4 . here",

    "nevertheless , as shown by @xcite , the quantity needed can be obtained from a relation such as @xmath43 whose left - hand side is free of inverses .",
    "the volume operator , made from fluxes , can be used for @xmath44 , @xmath22 can be expressed in terms of holonomies , and the poisson bracket is finally turned into a commutator divided by @xmath45 .    similarly , the curvature components @xmath40 of the ashtekar connection can be expressed in terms of holonomies using identities such as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a square loop of small coordinate area @xmath48 , with tangent vectors @xmath49 at one of its corners . finally ,",
    "extrinsic curvature components @xmath50 , the most complex expressions in the hamiltonian constraint owing to the spin connection ( [ spinconn ] ) as a functional of the densitized triad , can be obtained from what has already been constructed : @xmath51    in this way , a well - defined class of hamiltonian constraint operators arises , parameterized by certain ambiguities as they arise in the choices to be made .",
    "examples for ambiguities are the exact rewriting of the inverse determinant , or routings and representations for the holonomies used . in spite of ambiguities ,",
    "several characteristic properties can be extracted and evaluated phenomenologically . in particular , there are three main sources of quantum corrections :    * inverse volume corrections arise from quantizing the inverse triad determinant in an indirect manner . comparing eigenvalues of the resulting operators quantizing the left hand side of ( [ invtriad ] ) with the expressions expected from simply inserting flux eigenvalues into the right hand side of ( [ invtriad ] ) shows strong deviations for small flux scales ; see fig .",

    "in full generality , it is difficult to analyze the dynamics of quantum gravity , but several results are known in model systems ( based on symmetry reduction or perturbative inhomogeneities ) .",
    "one can easily imagine simplifications from the considerable reduction of the number of degrees of freedom , but also from another effect : level - splitting , well - known from energy spectra of atoms and molecules .",
    "also in quantum geometry , levels split when symmetries are relaxed , making spectra of symmetric situations much simpler than non - symmetric ones .",

    "the regularization is , of course , easy to implement in exactly homogeneous models , and it is far from being unique .",
    "the real issues to be faced arise when one tries to extend the regularization to inhomogeneous situations , at least of perturbative nature , in which extremely tight constraints due to covariance arise .",

    "it is not guaranteed that quantization preserves the usual space - time or differential - geometric notions , and that it leads to the same relationship between symmetries and lie derivatives .",
    "in contrast to differential geometry , an algebra of constraints , which will become a commutator algebra of the corresponding operators , can directly be carried over to the quantum theory . in this way",
    ", the realization of symmetries , and correspondingly of space - time structures , can be tested at the quantum level .",
    "quantum corrections usually change the constraints as gauge generators and may thus lead to changes in the space - time structures .",
    "also the algebra of constraints may be corrected , but for a consistent formulation , corrections must respect the first - class nature of the algebra . if the first - class nature is respected , symmetries may be deformed but are not lost ; the quantum system is then called anomaly - free .    `` effective '' constraints , including some of the corrections from quantum geometry ( in this case inverse volume corrections ) , can be made anomaly - free @xcite : @xmath134,d[m^a]\\}&= & d[{\\cal l}_{m^a}n^a]\\\\   \\{c_{(\\alpha)}[n],d[m^a]\\ } & = & c_{(\\alpha)}[{\\cal l}_{m^a}n]\\\\   \\{c_{(\\alpha)}[n],c_{(\\alpha)}[m]\\ } & = &   d[\\alpha^2 q^{ab}(n\\partial_bm - m\\partial_bn)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath136 is the correction function from inverse volume operators .",
    "this algebra is indeed first class , but deformed . to interpret the corrections",
    ", we first note that in an effective action they can not be purely of higher curvature type , for such corrections would still produce the classical algebra @xcite .",
    "we are thus dealing with a more general type of effective action ( such as one on a non - commutative space - time ) .",
    "similar deformations have been constructed for holonomy corrections , although not for the complete case of cosmological perturbations .",
    "the first example was found for spherically symmetric models @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , with a similar form produced for @xmath137-dimensional gravity @xcite .",
    "( although the deformations in those two cases are quite similar , there is a difference in that the @xmath137-example requires a non - vanishing cosmological constant for the deformation to appear . this circumstance may just be a consequence of the special form of @xmath137-dimensional gravity in the formulation used , where the theory without a cosmological constant has vanishing on - shell curvature and is topological . )",
    "constructing consistent deformations corresponding to quantum geometry corrections is the non - trivial part of an analysis making simple modifications such as ( [ regham ] ) relevant .",
    "practically , one consequence of the deformation is that the potential size of quantum corrections is larger than often expected , that is larger than @xmath138 as higher curvature terms would produce it in cosmological situations .",
    "the main physical mechanism is non - conservation of power on large scales , modifying an approximate conservation which classically follows very generally from the conservation of stress - energy , or the bianchi identity ; see e.g.@xcite .",
    "the bianchi identity , however , takes a different form for the corrected constraint algebra , and so quantum corrections affect large - scale modes , removing the constant one @xcite .",
    "local corrections for the slope of increase or decrease of super - hubble power , for scalar and tensor modes , are small , but realized during long evolution times .",
    "they may add up to sizeable effects .",
    "explicitly , the resulting cosmological perturbation equations ( for all scales on a background friedmann  robertson  walker space - time with conformal hubble rate @xmath139 and the background scalar @xmath140 )",
    "are @xcite @xmath141 from the diffeomorphism constraint , @xmath142 from the hamiltonian constraint , and @xmath143 as the evolution equation .",
    "these equations are accompanied by @xmath144 , which follows from off - diagonal components of the corrected einstein equation , and a corrected klein  gordon equation for @xmath145 .",
    "in addition to the gauge - invariant metric perturbations @xmath146 and @xmath147 and the scalar perturbation @xmath145 as well as the primary correction function @xmath148 from inverse volume ( and @xmath149 for the matter term ) , several other corrections , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath100 arise , but are related to the primary correction .    the consistency issue now becomes a very practical problem : there are five equations for three free functions , @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath145 .",
    "classically the system is consistent and not overdetermined thanks to general covariance .",
    "but will this closure of the equations be preserved in the presence of quantum corrections from discrete geometry ? as indicated by the possibility of a first - class ( but deformed ) algebra of constraints , consistency can be realized .",
    "there are no anomalies ( checked to linear order in perturbations in @xcite ) if the quantum correction functions satisfy equations such as @xmath153 the last of these equation relates higher perturbative orders of @xmath136 to the background value @xmath148 achieved for isotropic geometries .",
    "if these equations are satisfied , which is possible even in non - classical cases of @xmath154 , the whole set of cosmological perturbation equations is consistent .",
    "moreover , all coefficients for quantum corrections are fixed in terms of @xmath148 , and this function can be derived in isotropic models ( up to ambiguities ) .",
    "inverse volume corrections , resulting from discrete features of spatial quantum geometry , provide a consistent deformation : the underlying discreteness ( for this type of corrections ) does not destroy general covariance .",
    "general covariance is a statement about the quantum constraint algebra , and thus can be ensured only by considering perturbation theory without fixing the space - time gauge . after consistent equations have been derived , one may certainly pick a gauge ( such as the longitudinal one ) if that simplifies calculations .",
    "but fixing the gauge before deriving perturbation equations and observables does not verify covariance and can easily lead to spurious effects .",
    "explicit examples can be seen by comparing @xcite with @xcite , the first one with gauge - fixing , the second one without .",
    "as turns out , the relationship between the metric perturbations @xmath146 and @xmath147 is affected by the treatment , as is the precise form of non - conserved power on large scales . only without gauge - fixing",
    "is it possible to ensure consistency ; only those results are reliable .",
    "when computing the effects of an underlying discrete space - time structure on inflationary structure formation , or on the propagation of modes through a potential bounce , that kind of consistency is especially important . for evolution through a bounce , no consistent form for scalar modes has been found yet ; existing treatments all use gauge - fixing @xcite .",
    "one of the implications for cosmological scenarios is that quantum geometry corrections ( inverse volume or holonomy ) often imply super - inflation at high densities @xcite .",
    "there may not be many e - foldings in terms of @xmath155 , referring only to the final and initial values of the scale factor ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bounceac ] ) , but @xmath156 can be large due to the growth of @xmath139 during super - inflation @xcite .",
    "viable scenarios thus exist , but the degree of fine - tuning has not yet been fully estimated . regarding details ,",
    "several analyses have been performed depending on the scalar potential and quantization ambiguities .",
    "unfortunately , perturbation results are currently on a rather weak basis in strong quantum ( or high density ) regimes since anomaly - free effective equations are difficult to control .",
    "for instance , no consistent evolution of scalar modes through the bounce yet exists .",
    "nevertheless , in weaker regimes some parameters , such as the power - law of a scalar potential , can already be constrained ( in @xcite , using wmap5 data ) . at the current stage , primordial gravitational waves @xcite are under better analytical control since they are not subject to gauge transformation or overdeterminedness .",
    "some implications for the tensor power spectrum have been evaluated in @xcite .",
    "changes more .",
    "the effective solution corresponds to the solvable model as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : effbounce ] , transformed to proper time .",
    "similar solutions have been found in @xcite directly in proper time.,width=340 ]",
    "consistent deformations exist in model systems of canonical quantum gravity : discreteness can be realized without spoiling covariance .",
    "these results of anomaly freedom show that discrete structures are able to preserve covariance ; when realized , they make simple modifications as they are possible in homogeneous models highly non - trivial .",
    "so far , this demonstration has been achieved only in relatively tame regimes , but not yet close to the classical big bang singularity , or even through bounce phases .",
    "examples have been constructed for cosmological perturbations and for black holes .",
    "this is mainly based on canonical effective equations , whose tools , analytical as well as numerical ones , are currently being developed . in some cases , these equations already provide a link to cosmological , astrophysical and particle observations . one general result seems to be that the quantum space - time structure is certainly important in high - energy regimes , but , thanks to magnification effects , not necessarily just at the planck scale .",
    "this allows one to set bounds on parameters of quantum space - time , an extensive investigation that is still ongoing .",
