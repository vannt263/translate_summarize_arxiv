    "lattice approaches to describe gravity take several forms . among them , regge calculus and spin foams are expected to be intimately related .",
    "both are standardly built with a triangulation of spacetime .",
    "the idea of regge calculus @xcite is to concentrate curvature around @xmath0-simplices ( triangles in four dimensions ) . in its original from ,",
    "the geometric variables are the squared lengths of edges .",
    "the dihedral angles ( the angles between adjacent tetrahedra ) are functions of the edge lengths , and curvature is measured by the deficit angle around each triangle , which is basically the sum of the dihedral angles at simplices sharing that triangle .",
    "regge calculus has been revived in the eighties ( see @xcite for reviews and references therein ) and several alternative formulations have been discussed , in connection with the developments of loop quantum gravity and spin foams : first order regge calculus @xcite , using triangle areas instead of edge lengths ( @xcite for instance ) , and recently using areas and 3d dihedral angles @xcite .    as for spin foams , or rather sums over spin foams , they correspond to a way of writing transition amplitudes between spin network states in gauge theories @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a spin foam is a colored two - complex joining two spin networks . for a single two - complex which may be seen as dual to a triangulation ,",
    "the sum over spin foams is a state - sum model whose data come from the representation theory of some algebraic structure ( typically a lie group ) .",
    "we thus expect to derive spin foam models from lattice gauge theories @xcite , exactly as in 3d quantum gravity @xcite and lattice yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "this background independent framework is particularly well designed for topological bf theories @xcite .",
    "spin foam models for quantum gravity take advantage of a reformulation of general relativity as a constrained bf theory , plebanski theory @xcite .",
    "the so - called simplicity constraints ensure that the field @xmath1 comes from a frame field @xcite .    on the lattice ,",
    "the bivectors , discretizing the field @xmath1 on triangles , thus contain the geometric quantities , such as tetrahedron and 4-simplex volumes and in particular areas and 3d angles .",
    "dittrich and speziale @xcite have argued that area - angle regge calculus is the natural regge discretization of plebanski theory . although appealing , their porposal has some practical drawbacks : the expression of the ( 4d ) dihedral angles in terms of the 3d angles takes a complicated form , and so do the simplicity constraints .",
    "we show in this paper that all these expressions are naturally encoded , in a simple way , through the group structure of lattice plebanski theory .",
    "this is done by formulating cross - simplicity and the rules for parallelly transporting bivectors using only group variables .",
    "we then solve the parallel transport conditions for the holonomies in terms of the bivectors and additional angles .",
    "the latter are recognized as being the dihedral angles and can be seen as a discrete @xmath2 connection for an additional gauge symmetry .",
    "another interrogation in spin foams and regge calculus is the role of the immirzi parameter .",
    "more generally , in quantum gravity literature , the reader often finds himself in view of different interpretations . while some authors bring forward a topological interpretation of the immirzi parameter ( see @xcite , and references therein ) , its presence turns out to be crucial in loop quantum gravity to define the quantum geometry .",
    "it also plays an important role in the eprl @xcite and fk@xmath3 @xcite , @xcite spin foam models .",
    "the recent semi - classical analyses @xcite , @xcite show that it disappears from the action at the critical points , in agreement with the continuum .",
    "however , as far as we know , it has not been introduced in any form of the regge action .",
    "we here fill the first stage of that gap , proposing an action ( in fact , two , which are quite similar ) which includes the immirzi parameter . due to the parallel transport relations and cross - simplicity ,",
    "it is a function of only areas and dihedral angles , and corresponds to the compactified regge action @xcite , distorted by the immirzi parameter .",
    "similarly to the above - mentioned saddle point analyses , the immirzi dependence vanishes on - shell .",
    "we thus arrive at an improved setting which mixes the advantages of both lattice bf theory and regge calculus .",
    "the geometric quantities are clearly identified .",
    "the formulation using group elements enables to translate their insertions in the path integral as local observables into insertions in the sum over spin foams .",
    "for pure @xmath4 bf theory , we show that insertions of areas and 3d angles respectively translate into insertions of casimirs on triangles and of 6j - symbols on tetrahedra .",
    "an underlying motivation of this work is to find a framework allowing to derive the known spin foam models from the discretized path integral of constrained bf theory .",
    "the main approach to build spin foam models for quantum gravity relies on the geometric quantization of the tetrahedron classical phase space .",
    "this important idea has been developped in @xcite by barbieri , baez and barrett .",
    "the eprl model then imposes the constraints at the quantum level , via equations on casimir operators .",
    "the derivation of the fk@xmath3 model is different in spirit , but is also based on the quantization of the tetrahedron phase space , using coherent states @xcite . if these works have given a clear picture of cross - simplicity using the geometric quantization of a single tetrahedron , the issue of gluing adjacent tetrahedra is less transparent",
    ". it would be interesting to directly derive these models from a ( constrained ) lagrangian approach .",
    "several approaches have been recently developped in that direction .",
    "baratin , flori and thiemann @xcite have started from the holst action , thus without need for simplicity , and used a different spacetime discretization .",
    "it would certainly be interesting to relate their results to the standard framework .",
    "conrady and freidel @xcite have given a path integral representation of the fk@xmath3 and eprl models .",
    "it has nice geometric features , which have enabled the semi - classical analysis @xcite .",
    "it is however , in our view , specifically designed for the new spin foam models , and we would like to have a better control of the imposition of the constraints and of the gluing of tetrahedra .",
    "another programme has been initiated in @xcite , in which a lagrangian derivation of the barrett - crane spin foam model @xcite is given .",
    "it shows that the main problem of that model is not the implementation of cross - simplicity , but rather the gluing process between adjacent tetrahedra .",
    "indeed , the method allowing to recover the bc model is that used to generate spin foam models for _ unconstrained _ bf - like theories @xcite , and its equations of motion fail to yield the expected rules for parallelly transporting bivectors in the bc context .",
    "the present framework enables to choose and precisely control the way these gluing relations are taken into account in the path integral .",
    "since only group elements are used as configuration variables ( except areas ) , this formulation is particularly convenient to derive spin foam models using fourier expansions on the groups .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ lattice bf gauge theory ] , we review the standard lattice approach to bf theory , and solve the parallel transport relations for the holonomies . in section [ area - angle rc ] ,",
    "we extract the geometric quantities of area - angle regge calculus .",
    "it is shown that simplicity together with parallel transport naturally contain the expressions of the ( 4d ) dihedral angles and of the constraints of area - angle regge calculus .",
    "we also study the action and the role of the immirzi parameter .",
    "it is shown in section [ sf bf ] that the present setting reproduces the standard spin foam model for pure bf theory , and we compute the insertions of areas and 3d angles .    during the completion of this work",
    ", we have learnt that barrett _",
    "et al _ @xcite have developped a similar analysis , at least to extract the deficit angles , but in a quite different context .",
    "they are indeed interested in the semi - classical behaviour of the eprl model , which turns out to admit a regge form .",
    "our point of view is here that the definition of the discretized functional integral from constrained bf theory should itself have an interpretation _  la regge _ , since both are basically lattice gravity .",
    "it turns out that this idea has also been adopted by oriti in @xcite , from the group field theory point of view , with a similar emphasis on parallel transport relations .",
    "we are all along concerned with riemannian gravity , so that the relevant structure group is spin(4 ) .",
    "the lorentzian version of the present analysis will be studied elsewhere .",
    "let @xmath5 be a principal @xmath6-bundle over a 4d smooth manifold @xmath7 , spacetime , @xmath8 or spin(4 ) . consider a connection @xmath9 over @xmath5 , which will be locally seen , as usual , as a 1-form taking values in the lie algebra @xmath10 of @xmath6 ( @xmath11 where @xmath12 are euclidean 4d indices , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 in the case of @xmath4 ) .",
    "the action of the topological quantum field theory called bf @xcite , @xcite is built with a @xmath10-valued 2-form field @xmath1 , transforming under the adjoint representation of @xmath6 : s _ = _ m ( bf(a ) ) where @xmath15 $ ] is the curvature of @xmath9 .",
    "the action is gauge invariant and the equations of motion are : @xmath16 where @xmath17 $ ] is the covariant derivative . thus @xmath1 can be seen as a lagrange multiplier imposing @xmath9 to be flat .",
    "moreover , the field @xmath1 can be completely gauged away due to an additional symmetry : @xmath18 for any @xmath10-valued 1-form @xmath19 , while @xmath9 is unchanged .",
    "the theory has thus no local degrees of freedom .",
    "to quantize bf theory , we proceed in a standard way by first discretizing the variables . to fill the gap from lattice bf theory to regge calculus via the plebanski constraints , we choose a setting well - adapted to regge calculus .",
    "consider a simplicial decomposition of spacetime and ask for local frames on 3-simplices , i.e. tetrahedra , and on 4-simplices .",
    "this means that curvature is concentrated around 2-simplices , i.e. triangles .",
    "we will use the dual skeleton to the triangulation in an almost systematic way . in the dual picture ,",
    "triangles are dual to faces , both denoted @xmath20 , tetrahedra to edges , both denoted @xmath21 and 4-simplices to points denoted @xmath22 .",
    "the boundary of a dual face is made of the edges and vertices respectively dual to the tetrahedra and 4-simplices sharing @xmath20 .",
    "the orientations of tetrahedra and triangles induce orientations for dual edges and dual faces .    as far as bf theory is concerned , the case @xmath23spin(4 ) is just two copies of the @xmath4 case , so that we focus here on @xmath8 .",
    "the connection is discretized like in usual lattice gauge theory : we consider @xmath4 elements @xmath24 which allow for parallel transport between local frames . in the dual skeleton picture ,",
    "the two ends of a dual edge @xmath21 correspond to the two 4-simplices sharing the tetrahedron @xmath21 .",
    "thus , a dual edge is attached two group elements @xmath24 , one for each end .",
    "the curvature around a triangle @xmath20 is thus measured by the oriented product of these group elements all along the boundary of the dual face , starting at a base point ( reference frame ) @xmath25 , @xmath26 if @xmath22 , @xmath27 are source and target vertices for each dual edge @xmath21 . the flatness imposed by the e.o.m .",
    "then reads : @xmath28for each @xmath20 .    the field @xmath1 , as a 2-form is discretized on the triangles of the triangulation , in a given frame for each of them , @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "expressions of @xmath31 in different frames are naturally related by parallel transport along the boundary of @xmath20 .",
    "it simply results from the discretisation of the e.o.m .",
    ", integrated along dual edges between different tetrahedra or 4-simplices .",
    "@xmath4 gauge transformations change the local frames on tetrahedra and 4-simplices .",
    "a gauge transformation @xmath32 is a family of group elements @xmath33 acting by : @xmath34 the gauge invariant action takes the form of a sum over triangles : s_(b_f(t),g_vt ) = _ f ( b_f(t)g_f(t ) ) which is obviously independent of the choice of the base point for each triangle . because of the simple rules of parallel transport for the @xmath35s , one can choose as basic variables the elements @xmath24 and only one @xmath35 per face .",
    "things are not so simple when introducing the simplicity constraints , and it is then convenient , in order to solve them within each tetrahedron , to start with independent @xmath36 in the frame of each tetrahedron sharing @xmath20 .",
    "it is as if the triangulation were broken up into a disjoint union of tetrahedra . while solving simplicity within tetrahedron , some gluing relations are necessary to stick tetrahedra together and carry the information about parallelly transporting @xmath31 .",
    "the idea is thus to use a measure such as : _",
    "( t , v)dg_vt  _ ( f , t ) d^3b_ft  _ ( f , v)(b_ft- g_ttb_ftg_tt ) [ su2 gluing ] in @xmath4 matrix notation , and with : g_tt = g_vtg_vt standing for the parallel transport between two adjacent tetrahedra @xmath21 and @xmath37 through the 4-simplex @xmath22 , along the boundary of the dual face @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath38 is the @xmath4 haar measure and the measure @xmath39 is to be precised in the following .",
    "the gluing relations take place at each pair @xmath40 , often called wedge , since two tetrahedra sharing a triangle @xmath20 lie in a common 4-simplex @xmath22 , @xmath20 and @xmath22 identifying them .",
    "the structure group being @xmath8 , the norm and the direction of @xmath36 have different roles .",
    "we will also see that the simplicity constraints assign them different roles in order to reconstruct metricity .",
    "first , it is clear that the norm of @xmath36 and that of @xmath41 are equal , @xmath42 : it is a @xmath4 gauge invariant quantity .",
    "let us use the following parametrisation for each @xmath36 as a 2 by 2 matrix : [ b parametrisation ] b_ft = a_f_ft , _ ft = n_ft_z n_ftwith @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 is the standard pauli matrix diag@xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the 3-vector whose components are the pauli matrices .",
    "@xmath47 stands for the norm of each @xmath36 , @xmath48 , and is clearly independent of any local frame . for reasons which will become obvious in the sequel , we will also call it the area of @xmath20 .",
    "notice that we can equivalently consider @xmath49 or @xmath50 , since a change of sign of the area can be reabsorbed into the directions @xmath51 without changing the action .",
    "the direction @xmath52 of @xmath36 is encoded in the group element @xmath53 .",
    "however only two parameters of @xmath53 are relevant since @xmath36 is invariant under the right action of the @xmath54 subgroup generated by @xmath44 , @xmath55 .",
    "it is clear in the euler parametrisation of @xmath4 , @xmath56 , that the angle @xmath3 is an ambiguity in the definition , which should be integrated out .",
    "this allows to rewrite the measure using the @xmath54 and @xmath4 haar measures : [ gluing measure ]    & _",
    "f d(a_f )  _ ( f , t ) d^2_ft  _ ( f , v ) ^(2)(_ft - r(g_tt)_ft ) + & _ f d(a_f )  _ ( f , t ) dn_ft  _ ( f , v ) _ 0 ^",

    "@xmath58 is the @xmath4 haar measure and on the right side of this equation , it is understood that the euler angle @xmath3 of each @xmath53 does not play any role since it can be reabsorbed into the angles @xmath59 which are integrated out in the measure .",
    "we are not interested in the precise correspondence , including jacobians , between the two above expressions , since we look for the simplest and most natural measure with regard to lattice gauge theory , thus using group elements and the corresponding haar measures as much as possible .",
    "the remaining ambiguity is the measure @xmath60 , which will be fixed to be the lebesgue measure on @xmath61 by requiring to recover the standard spin foam model for @xmath4 bf theory ( see section [ sf bf ] ) .      up to now ,",
    "the configuration variables are the group elements @xmath24 , the norms @xmath47 and the directions @xmath51 , i.e. unit 3-vectors which can be encoded in the group elements @xmath53 up to right @xmath54 multiplication . in particular",
    ", the action is a function of @xmath24 , @xmath47 and @xmath51 .",
    "the key idea is now to consider the three angles of each @xmath53 as classical configuration variables , together with the angles @xmath59 which are integrated out to define the measure in . in order to extract the dihedral angles , we need to solve the parallel transport relations for the holonomies @xmath62 in terms of the bivectors",
    "this has been done implicitly in .",
    "given an assignment of elements @xmath24 for parallel transport and @xmath53 for each triangle in each tetrahedron , the gluing condition between adjacent tetrahedra implies that there exist angles @xmath63 such that : [ gluing n ] n_ft = g_ttn_fte^_fv_z which is precisely the content of the delta functions in . as emphasized , the euler angles @xmath3 of the variables @xmath53 are unphysical since they do not apear in the expression of @xmath51 .",
    "however , it seems that they do play a role in .",
    "the important point is in fact that @xmath62 , being equal to : @xmath64 , does not depend on the euler angles @xmath3 .",
    "the angles @xmath59 have to take care of the relations between adjacent @xmath53 and @xmath65 for any local choice of these euler angles .",
    "the enlarging of the configuration space thus leads to an additional @xmath54 gauge symmetry , acting at each pair @xmath66 , on the right of @xmath53 .",
    "this means that each pair @xmath66 is equipped with a @xmath54 reference frame which can be arbitrarily transformed by @xmath54 right multiplication .",
    "the angles @xmath59 appear as a sort of connection for this gauge symmetry . let us note that to take care of the @xmath4 gauge invariance , one only has to look at the left of @xmath53 . indeed , these symmetries act on the new variables as : @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "since @xmath21 and @xmath37 are adjacent , the corresponding dual edges share the vertex @xmath22 along the boundary of the dual face @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath69 is positive when the path @xmath70 through @xmath22 is oriented like @xmath20 , and else negative .",
    "the transformations of the angles @xmath59 are clearly a discretisation of the usual @xmath71 gauge transformations for a connection .",
    "they transform so that the holonomies @xmath62 are indeed independent of the local choices of euler angles @xmath3 .",
    "consequently , we will be interested , to make the link with regge calculus , in @xmath4 and @xmath54 gauge invariant quantities . when solving the simplicity constraints",
    ", we will show that such angles have the meaning of dihedral angles between tetrahedra @xmath21 and @xmath37 , and that the @xmath54 subgroup preserving @xmath36 , generated by @xmath72 , acquires a real physical meaning .    to get a hint about the meaning of these angles ,",
    "note that the content of the delta functions in can now be used to rewrite the action as a function of @xmath53 and @xmath59 , in addition to @xmath47 and @xmath24 .",
    "the relation can first be inverted to express @xmath62 in terms of @xmath73 and @xmath59 .",
    "thus , it corresponds to ( partially ) solving the discrete analog of the e.o.m .",
    "@xmath74 for the connection , in terms of the discrete @xmath1 , with a free parameter , @xmath59 .",
    "the holonomy around each face is then given by : g_f(t ) = n_fte^-_f _ zn_ft= e^-_fb_ft where @xmath75 .",
    "thus , @xmath76 represents the class angle of the rotation @xmath77 , and its direction is directly given by that of @xmath36 , @xmath51 .",
    "in particular @xmath36 is left invariant by @xmath77 as expected .",
    "we can now rewrite the action with the additional variables : s_(a_f , n_ft,_fv , g_vt ) = _ f a_f ( ) it is trivially @xmath4 gauge invariant , and also invariant under the @xmath54 transformations . provided that the angles @xmath59 are interpreted as dihedral angles and @xmath47 as the area of @xmath20 , it corresponds to the so - called compactified regge action , proposed in @xcite and @xcite . to make this statement precise , we need to study the imposition of the simplicity constraints which ensure metricity .",
    "in the continuum , gravity is described with spin(4 ) bf theory when the field @xmath1 is restricted to a configuration space satisfying : _",
    "ijklb^ij_b^kl _ _ where @xmath78 are spacetime indices . when the proportionality coefficient is non - vanishing , the theory consists in two branches up to global signs @xcite : @xmath79 or @xmath80 for a non - degenerate cotetrad 1-form @xmath81 .",
    "gravity corresponds to the second case , up to a global sign in front of the action , whereas the first case will be called to be non - geometric .",
    "its e.o.m .",
    "are just @xmath82 , which constrain the torsion to vanish but leave curvature free .    at the discrete level",
    ", the constraints only involve the so - called bivectors @xmath83 , which can be written in terms of their self - dual and anti - self - dual components , @xmath84 due to the splitting @xmath85 .",

    "the second constraint , called cross - simplicity constraint , asks for the sum of two bivectors of a tetrahedron to be also simple .",
    "finally , the constraint imply that all tetrahedra all closed and is thus mentioned as the closure relation .",
    "when these constraints are satisfied for a tetrahedron , its edges can be labelled by 4-vectors only spanning a three - dimensional subspace of @xmath94 . as in the continuum , the bivectors or their hodge dual are wedge ( anti - symmetrized ) products of these vectors up to a sign@xmath95 . to distinguish between the two solutions , can be changed with : _",

    "@xmath96 is in both cases interpreted as a unit vector perpendicular to the edges of the tetrahedron @xmath21 .",
    "the interesting point is that , in a 4-simplex , simplicity of the five tetrahedra , together with the relations of parallel transport between adjacent tetrahedra [ transport bivectors ] b_f(t ) = g_ttb_f(t)g_tt , with @xmath97 , induce metricity of the 4-simplex .",
    "this is due to the fact that two triangles sharing an edge in 4-simplex can always be viewed to be in the boundary of a tetrahedron ( this point will be crucial in the present work ) .",

    "each of them appears four times , once for each face of the tetrahedron @xmath21 , in the representations , say , @xmath286 and @xmath287 .",
    "such a group averaging can be written as the identity on the invariant space carrying these representations , @xmath288 , under the form of a sum over a complete orthogonal basis .",
    "the basis elements , called intertwiners , are specified by the choice of a 2 by 2 pairing and of a ( internal or virtual ) representation between both pairs .",
    "more precisely , we define : ^j_1 j_2,i , j_3 j_4_m_1 m_2 m_3 m_4 = _ m =- i^i    j_1 & j_2 & i + m_1 & m_2 & m    ( -1)^i - m    i & j_3 & j_4 + -m & m_3 & m_4    which will be shortly denoted @xmath289 , although it does not make the pairing explicitly appear .",
    "the chosen pairing is here @xmath290 with @xmath291 , and the internal representation @xmath275 .",
    "the result of integrating four matrix elements reads : [ int g4 ] _ ( 2 ) dg  _",
    "^ 4 d^(j_a)_m_a n_a(g ) = _ i d_i  _ m_a(j_a , i)_n_a(j_a , i ) then , when an element @xmath24 is integrated out , it leads to two intertwiners respectively due to the 4-simplex @xmath22 and tetrahedron @xmath21 indices . since a tetrahedron is shared by two 4-simplices @xmath22 and @xmath27 , the previous formula applies twice and the tetrahedron is labelled with two intertwiners of representations @xmath292 and @xmath293 carrying indices from the tetrahedron ends of @xmath24 and @xmath294 .",
    "moreover , the group element @xmath24 always appears composed with @xmath295 , so that both intertwiners , provided they have the same pairing , are contracted according to the orthogonality relation : _",
    "m_a(j_a , i ) _",
    "m_a(j_a , i ) = as for intertwiners with indices from 4-simplices , the five intertwiners corresponding the five tetrahedra meeting at a 4-simplex @xmath22 are contracted through the ten faces of @xmath22 , and thus according to the structure of a 15j - symbol from @xmath4 recoupling theory @xcite .",
    "thus , the partition function can be written @xcite : z _ = _ \\{j_f } _",
    "\\{i_t }  _ f d_j_f  _ t d_i_t  _ v ( j_f , i_t )      the data appearing in the sum over spin foams are usually interpreted through the canonical quantization @xcite , @xcite . in particular , the representations @xmath296 labelling dual faces stand for lengths of edges in 3d ( this is in fact the very definition of the ponzano - regge model ) and areas of triangles in 4d .",
    "using the loop quantization , the spectrum of these operators can be computed at the quantum level and their square scales as @xmath297 @xcite .",
    "these results can also be obtained from the covariant quantization , by computing quantum average with the functional integral and insertions of states exciting the dual faces .",
    "it has been properly done recently in 3d @xcite .",
    "we do not propose this treatment here , the issue of the gauge - fixing being more subtle than in 3d , due to the reducibility of the gauge transformations @xcite .",
    "but we are rather interested in the translation of insertions of local observables into the language of spin foams .    first consider a given dual face @xmath298 , and insert into @xmath270 ,",
    ", the local observable @xmath299 : z _ = _ ( t , v ) dg_vt _ ( f , t ) dn_ft _ ( f , v ) _ ff^ d(a_f ) e^ia_f the result is naturally not modified for @xmath300 .",
    "as previously , the variables @xmath301 are eliminated using the gluing relations , except one which leads to with @xmath302 and @xmath303 . the representation @xmath304 is also constrained to be integral because of the integral over @xmath195 .",
    "the change comes from the integral over the area : _ _ + daa^2j_m(a ) = m^2 - 1",
    ",  m2the important point is that , as before , the sum over the angular momentum @xmath305 , which is the variable dual to @xmath306 , can be explicitly performed .",
    "in addition to the standard dual face weight , @xmath307 , it leads to the insertion into of the following quantum area : a_j = = ( d_j^2 - 4 ) this spectrum gives a negative value for @xmath308 , would vanish for @xmath309 , and then increases like @xmath310 .",
    "up to a coefficient @xmath311 , this corresponds to the result obtained in @xcite in 3d , with a precise formulation including a gauge fixing process .",
    "as explained by the authors , the result crucially depends on measure factors and the way curvature is described in the lattice theory .",
    "it is thus an interesting result , given the different setting chosen here , which involves different measures and computations .",
    "let us come back to the expansion .",
    "for a given area , all @xmath54 modes are involved .",
    "but after integration over @xmath9 , we are free to interpret each component @xmath312 as a regge action with deficit angle @xmath195 and quantized area @xmath281 .",
    "areas are usually rather quantized as spins of @xmath4 representations . and",
    "indeed , in the previous computations , we see that the sum over @xmath281 can be explicitly performed , leading to standard results .",
    "however , in more intricate situations , this sum may not be possible to perform and @xmath281 may be interpreted as a quantized area . to convince oneself ,",
    "let us apply to the same expansion to the action @xmath206 : ( ia_f(^+_f + ^-_f ) ) = _ m_f j_m_f(a_f)e^_+ m_f ^+_f e^_-m_f^-_f defining @xmath313 , we obviously have : m_f = m_f^-/_- = m_f^+/_+ this is precisely the relation usually written between the spins quantizing the areas , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we would have indeed written this relation if we have used the bivectors @xmath314 , with @xmath315 to define the theory .",
    "diagonal simplicity would have then implied : @xmath316 for the newly defined self - dual and anti - self - dual areas .",
    "this strongly suggests that the information concerning the areas are recorded in the spin foam into the @xmath54 modes of the regge action .",
    "let us now study the insertion of the 3d angle , @xmath317 , which is the angle between the directions of @xmath51 and @xmath318 within @xmath21 .",
    "consider two triangles @xmath181 and @xmath182 in @xmath21 .",
    "this angle can be expressed as : @xmath319 .",
    "we naturally expect its translation into spin foams to involve the intertwining representation @xmath320 , since @xmath290 and @xmath291 are coupled through @xmath320 , if the pairing of the intertwiner is well chosen .",
    "we thus write : @xmath321 .",
    "after integration over areas and dihedral angles , the weight for @xmath181 is : [ insertion 3d angle ] \\{_j_1 d_j_1 d^(j_1)_00(n_1g_1n_1 ) + _",
    "m_1>0_j_1 d_j_1 ( d^(j_1)_(n_1g_1n_1 ) + ( -1)^m_1 d^(j_1)_--(n_1g_1n_1))}d^(1)_0a(n_1 ) as before , though it has not been explicitly precised , since @xmath322 , the partition function sums over the orientation of each dual face with a coefficient @xmath323 ( independently of the insertion of the 3d angle observable , see expression ) .",
    "the result of is now modified and the relevant quantity becomes , for @xmath181 : [ int n 3d angle ] _ ( 2)dn  d^(j)_ll(ng n )  d^(1)_0a(n ) = -(-1)^j - l    j & j & 1 + -l & l & 0    _ a , b ( -1)^j - a(-1)^1-a    j & j & 1 + -a & b & -a",
    "d^(j)_ab(g ) the quantity for @xmath182 can be obtained using @xmath324 .",
    "because of the sum over the orientation in , we have to evaluate the properties of under the change @xmath325 .",
    "given the properties of the 3jm - symbols , one sees that only the sign is changed .",
    "in contrast with @xmath270 , it implies that the variable @xmath326 , dual to the deficit angle @xmath76 , has to be odd for @xmath181 and @xmath182 , and then that the representations @xmath290 and @xmath291 are in @xmath327 .",
    "notice that the first term in , corresponding to @xmath284 , does not contribute since the 3jm - symbols @xmath328 are zero for @xmath329 .",
    "like in pure bf theory , the sum over the angular momenta @xmath330 and @xmath331 can be explicitly performed thanks to the special form of the 3jm - symbols . indeed , @xmath332 .",
    "the left figure shows the graph weighting the tetrahedron @xmath21 and resulting from the insertion of the 3d angle between @xmath181 and @xmath182 in @xmath21 .",
    "in contrast with pure bf theory , it does not simply consist of the contraction of the intertwiners coming from the integrations of @xmath333 and @xmath334 because of the insertion of a link in the spin 1 representation between the links of @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "this graph reduces to the evaluation of a 6j - symbol if the pairing is conveniently chosen , displaying the role of the intertwiners in the quantization of the 3d angle .",
    ", width=377 ]    the indices @xmath335 and @xmath336 of the matrix elements @xmath337 and @xmath338 are , after integration over the holonomy degrees of freedom , carried by two intertwiners , with different internal representations @xmath275 and @xmath339 taking place at the tetrahedron @xmath21 . in the absence of the observable insertion , one has instead of the 3jm - symbol of a kronecker delta , @xmath340 .",
    "now , the contraction of these two intertwiners is not made according to the orthogonality relation .",
    "a link in the spin 1 representation is inserted between the links @xmath290 and @xmath291 of the two faces , as shown in figure [ 3dinsertion ] . however ,",
    "if the pairing is well chosen , the equality @xmath341 still holds , and the graph reduces to that of a 6j - symbol . assuming without loss of generality that @xmath181 and @xmath182 are similarly oriented and gathering the numerical coefficients , the insertion of @xmath342 translates into the insertion into @xmath343 written as a sum over spin foams of the following quantity :     j_1 & j_1 & 1 + j_2 & j_2 & i_t    , j_1,j_2 + where the quantity into brackets denotes the 6j - symbol represented in figure [ 3dinsertion ] with a tetrahedral graph .",
    "the angle between two triangles is thus quantized as a 6j - symbol .",
    "the latter not only involves @xmath290 and @xmath291 which contain the areas of @xmath181 and @xmath182 , but also the representation @xmath320 of the intertwiner at which the triangles meet .",
    "the intertwining data @xmath344 of @xmath270 thus encode the correlations between the directions of triangles .",
    "precise relations between lattice bf theory , supplemented with the simplicity constraints , and area - angle regge calculus are given .",
    "the expressions of the constraints in area - angle regge calculus and of the ( 4d ) dihedral angles in terms of the 3d angles take a simple form through a formulation of the gluing relations and cross - simplicity with group elements .",
    "the dihedral angles enable to express holonomies in terms of bivectors , and appear as part of a @xmath2 discrete connection .",
    "we propose two actions ( the difference being rather a technical ambiguity ) which include the immirzi parameter",
    ". it might be interesting to study some other ambiguities , such as choosing a higher spin representation instead of the fundamental .",
    "our work leads to a mixed setting , combining variables from both regge calculus and lattice bf gauge theory , and whose geometric content is crystal - clear . as emphasized in the introduction , we believe that it is important to have a ( compactified ) regge - like action for which the introduction of the immirzi parameter makes sense , in particular while aiming at understanding its nature at the quantum level .",
    "the immirzi dependence here disappears from the classical equations of motion for non - degenerate configurations .",
    "the case of degenerate configurations is less clear , but the recent classification results of @xcite are certainly helpful in this regard .    finally , insertions of areas and 3d angles are converted into spin foam language . as expected , areas are quantized according to the casimirs of triangle representations .",
    "their quantization in the presence of the simplicity constraints is briefly discussed .",
    "the insertion of a 3d angle corresponds to the insertion of a 6j - symbol , whose data are the spins of the two involved triangle representations and the tetrahedral intertwining spin .",
    "let us briefly argue that the present setting is well suited to study spin foam models from discretized path integrals .",
    "we can choose and completely control how cross - simplicity and parallel transport relations are taken into account .",
    "indeed , instead of the strong gluing using delta functions over @xmath4 , , the parallel transport relations can be inserted with another weight .",
    "it should be peaked around the identity , so that the equations of motion give the correct rules , and take the following form : _ ( n_ftg_ttn_fte^_fv_z ) = _ j _",
    "=- j^j f_jm ( )  j , m  n_ftg_ttn_fte^_fv_z  j , m+ only diagonal elements of the representation matrices are considered , the integrals over the angles @xmath170 and @xmath134 leading anyway to this situation @xcite .",
    "the strong gluing corresponds to the choice @xmath345 .",
    "@xmath346 is a generic variable which suggests to consider families of models .",
    "for instance , we may take @xmath347 to be a one - parameter family of gaussians of width @xmath346 : _",
    "( k)=e^^2(k ) ,  f_jm ( ) = ( i_j ( ) - i_j+1 ( ) ) where @xmath348 and @xmath349 are normalisations and @xmath350 is a modified bessel function , defined by @xmath351 .",
    "notice that this is quite similar to the setting used in semi - classical computations of correlation functions from spin foam models @xcite : one inserts a boundary state which assigns a mean geometry to the boundary of the spacetime region under consideration .",
    "the above functions precisely assign , as we have shown , mean dihedral angles between the boundary tetrahedra for each 4-simplex .",
    "the spin foam models resulting from different choices of @xmath352 will all exhibit similar structures , since spin foams are based on the integrations of the variables @xmath53 and @xmath24 . from this perspective , the coefficients @xmath353 may be seen as a measure ambiguity , exactly like that affecting the definition of the eprl model . while the differences between two spin foam models differing by their sets of coefficients @xmath353 may be rather arcane , computing the corresponding functions @xmath352 would teach us precisely about these differences .",
    "a crucial issue is then obviously the ability to resum these coefficients after the integrations .",
    "however , some interesting choices of functions can prevent us from such a challenge , such as coefficients of the form : @xmath354 , as will be shown in @xcite . in any case , the possibility of easily tuning the fluctuations around the gluing relations is a promising tool towards the understanding of the content of spin foam models .",
    "the same approach can be applied to cross - simplicity , as written in the third equation of .",
    "the resulting spin foam models will be presented elsewhere @xcite and in particular the way the new spin foam models for quantum gravity arises .",
