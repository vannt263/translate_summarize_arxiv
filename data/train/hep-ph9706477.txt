    "much of the enthusiasm for searching for @xmath0 mixing stems from the belief that the search carries a large discovery potential for new physics , since the mixing rate @xmath1/ @xmath2 is expected to be small in the standard model ( range from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , see references in elsewhere  @xcite ) .",
    "one can characterize @xmath0 mixing in terms of two dimensionless variables : @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where the quantities @xmath7 and @xmath8 are defined by @xmath9 and @xmath10 with @xmath11 @xmath12 being the masses and decay rates of the two cp ( even and odd ) eigenstates . assuming a small mixing , namely , @xmath13 or @xmath14 , we have @xmath15 .",
    "an overview of the current experimental status and future prospects can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "this paper only gives a brief review of the experimental techniques which can be used to search for @xmath0 mixing .",
    "the techniques which can be used to search for mixing can be roughly divided into two classes : hadronic and semi - leptonic .",
    "each method has advantages and limitations , which are described below .",
    "the hadronic method is to search for the @xmath16 decays @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "these decays can occur either through @xmath0 mixing followed by cabibbo favored decay @xmath18(x ) , or through dcsd ( doubly cabibbo suppressed decay ) @xmath17 .",
    "this means that the major complication for this method is the need to distinguish between dcsd and mixing .",
    "the hadronic method can therefore be classified according to how dcsd and mixing are distinguished . in principle , there are at least three different ways to distinguish between dcsd and mixing candidates experimentally : ( a ) use the difference in the decay time - dependence ; ( b ) use the possible difference in the resonant substructure between dcsd and mixing events in @xmath19,@xmath20 , etc .",
    "modes ; ( c ) use the quantum statistics of the production and the decay processes ; ( d ) there is also a possibility of using the cp eigen states , such as @xmath21 ( singly cabibbo suppressed decays  scsd ) , to study mixing caused by the decay rate difference : @xmath22 . note that dcsd decays are interesting in their own right , since they can be used to extract ckm angle @xmath23 in @xmath24 modes  @xcite .",
    "this method is to measure the decay time of the @xmath25 decay . here",
    "the @xmath16 tagging is usually done by using the decay chain @xmath26 followed by @xmath27 .",
    "a pure @xmath16 state generated at @xmath28 decays to the @xmath29 state either by @xmath0 mixing or by dcsd , and the two amplitudes may interfere .",
    "following the notation in ref.1 , and define @xmath30 , @xmath31 with @xmath32 ; @xmath33 , @xmath34 with @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , for @xmath38 and small @xmath39 ( in the case of @xmath40 ) , we have  @xcite @xmath41    @xmath42    note the difference between equation  [ mixingrate_kpi ] and  [ mixingrate_kpibar ] is the indication of cp violation .",
    "next let us write the equations in a somewhat different form , which is more convenient for discussion here .",
    "note that @xmath43 where now the time t is measured in unit of average @xmath16 lifetime ( @xmath44 ) . recall that we have @xmath45 and define @xmath46 , the term above can be written in the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an unknown phase between the two amplitudes .",
    "equation  [ mixingrate_kpi ] and  [ mixingrate_kpibar ] now become : @xmath49~e^{-t}. } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath50~e^{-t}. } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "note @xmath53 is different from @xmath54 because @xmath55 where @xmath56 ( and one can define @xmath57 in the usual way ) . for convenience ,",
    "let us ignore the cp violation in the decay amplitude .",
    "thus the difference between the interference terms ( that is , the interference phase @xmath54 and @xmath53 ) in equation  [ time_dep_kpi_cp ] and  [ time_dep_kpi_cp_bar ] would be the indication of cp violation .    assuming cp conservation , equation  [ time_dep_kpi_cp ] and  [ time_dep_kpi_cp_bar ] simply become  @xcite :    @xmath58    the signature of mixing is therefore a deviation from a perfect exponential time distribution with the slope of @xmath59 .",
    "a small mixing signature could show up in the interference term at lower decay times .",
    "the importance of the interference term has been discussed in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the importance of possible large cp violation effect ( due to new physics ) has been discussed by wolfenstein  @xcite and others  @xcite .",
    "it has also recently been argued by browder and pakvasa  @xcite that it may be possible to calculate the phase @xmath60 due to final state interaction .",
    "it is interesting to take a look at the time integrated effect .",
    "let us define @xmath61 and we have  @xcite @xmath62    in the special case when @xmath63 , equation  [ time_int_kpi ] can be written in the form @xmath64      the idea  @xcite is to use the wrong sign decay @xmath26 followed by @xmath65 , @xmath66 , etc . , and use the possible differences of the resonant substructure between mixing and dcsd to study mixing . in principle , one can use the difference between the resonant substructure for dcsd and mixing events to distinguish mixing from dcsd .",
    "for instance , combined with method a , one can perform a multi - dimensional fit to the data by using the information on @xmath67 , @xmath68 , proper decay time @xmath69 and the yield density on dalitz plot @xmath70 .",
    "the extra information on the resonant substructure will , in principle , put a better constraint on mixing .",
    "of course , one needs large amount of clean data to do this in the future .",
    "because of this , for current experiments this method is more likely to be a complication rather than a better method . in general",
    ", we can not treat multi - body decays exactly the same way as @xmath27 when the resonant substructure is ignored .",
    "one can find detail discussions about this elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "this method is to search for dual identical two - body hadronic decays in @xmath71 , such as @xmath72 , as was first suggested by yamamoto in his ph.d thesis  @xcite .",
    "the idea is that when @xmath0 pairs are generated in a state of odd orbital angular momentum ( such as @xmath73 ) , the dcsd contribution to identical two - body pseudo - scalar - vector ( @xmath74 ) and pseudo - scalar - pseudo - scalar ( @xmath75 ) hadronic decays ( such as @xmath72 ) cancels out , leaving only the contribution of mixing  @xcite in the wrong sign versus right sign ratio : @xmath76 one common misunderstanding about this method is that dcsd is forbidden in this case .",
    "this is not true , dcsd is allowed with mixing and contributes to both wrong sign and right sign ( but the contribution cancels out in the ratio ) .",
    "one can find the essence of yamamoto s original calculation for the @xmath72 case elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "detailed calculations for this kind of method can be found in a recent paper  @xcite .",
    "this is because ( assuming cp conservation ) those decays occur only through the cp even eigenstate , which means the decay time distribution is a perfect exponential with the slope of @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , one can use those modes to measure @xmath78 .",
    "the mixing signature is not a deviation from a perfect exponential ( assuming cp conservation ) , but rather a deviation of the slope from @xmath79 .",
    "since @xmath80 can be measured by using the @xmath81 decay time distribution , one can then derive @xmath22 .",
    "observation of a non - zero @xmath77 would demonstrate mixing caused by the decay rate difference ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "note that there is no need to tag the @xmath16 , since we only need to determine the slope .",
    "the semi - leptonic method is to search for @xmath82 decays , where there is no dcsd involved .",
    "however , it usually ( not always ) suffers from a large background due to the missing neutrino .",
    "in addition , the need to understand the large background often introduces model dependence .",
    "new ideas are needed in order to improve the sensitivity significantly .",
    "one can find more discussions elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , vertexing and tagging are the two critical elements to the study of mixing and cp violation . for @xmath83 and @xmath84 , tagging has always been one of the major issues and has been proven to be difficult . in @xmath0 case",
    ", tagging seems to be easier as one has the clear advantage of using the decay chain @xmath26 ( see below ) , however , the much smaller @xmath0 mixing rate requires much cleaner tagging .    as mentioned before",
    ", the @xmath16 tagging is usually done by using the decay chain @xmath26 followed by @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath85 from @xmath86 has a soft momentum spectrum and is referred to as `` the slow pion '' .",
    "the charge of the slow pion is correlated with the charm quantum number of the @xmath16 meson and thus can be used to tag whether a @xmath16 or @xmath87 meson was produced .",
    "the idea is to search for wrong sign @xmath86 decays , where the slow pion has the same charge as the kaon arising from the @xmath16 decay .",
    "the right sign signal @xmath26 followed by @xmath88 can be used to provide a model - independent normalization for the mixing measurement .",
    "the small @xmath89 value of the @xmath86 decay results in a very good mass resolution in the mass difference @xmath90 and allows a @xmath86 signal to obtained with very low background . in general , mixing search requires at least : ( 1 ) excellent vertexing capabilities , at least good enough to see the interference structure ; ( 2 ) low background around the primary vertex",
    ".    the vertexing capabilities at @xmath91 experiments ( @xmath92 ) for cleo iii and asymmetric b factories at slac and kek may be sufficient for a mixing search . the extra path length due to the lorentz boost , together with the use of silicon detectors for high resolution position measurements ,",
    "have given the fixed target experiments an advantage in vertex resolution ( typically @xmath93 ) over @xmath91 experiments .",
    "the background level around the primary vertex could be an important issue .",
    "low background around primary vertex means that one does not suffer much from random slow pion background .",
    "define @xmath94 as the number of wrong sign background events , @xmath95 the number of signal events and @xmath89 the @xmath96 mass difference , one has  @xcite :    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the mass difference resolution .",
    "note the background density , @xmath99 , is a characteristic of the fragmentation process . at cleo ii ,",
    "the background density is about 0.001 per @xmath100 and @xmath101 which means that @xmath102 . for cleo iii and @xmath103 ,",
    "@xmath98 can be reduced down to @xmath104 with the silicon vertex detector .",
    "the low background around the primary vertex at @xmath91 experiments is a certain advantage .",
    "one disadvantage at fixed target experiments is the higher background around the primary vertex ( higher @xmath105 ) .",
    "while vertexing capabilities will likely be improved in the future , the background density seems difficult to improve . however , there are some ideas  @xcite to improve the background density for the future experiments . for example , for asymmetric b factory or z factory , fixed target experiments ( such as hear - b ) and especially hadron machines ( tevatron , lhc ) ,",
    "it maybe possible to use @xmath106 , where the primary ( @xmath86 decay ) vertex can be determined by the @xmath107 together with the slow pion coming from the @xmath86 . in this case",
    ", the background level around the primary vertex is intrinsically low since the @xmath108 ( or @xmath94 ) decay vertex is no longer the event vertex . here the background density , @xmath99 , is no longer a characteristic of the fragmentation process .",
    "in fact , cdf  @xcite has recently obtained rather clean right sign signal for @xmath109 followed by the decay chain @xmath26 and @xmath88 ( @xmath110 signal events from @xmath111 data ) .",
    "it maybe also possible to use hadronic @xmath94 decays ( assuming one can trigger on these events ) , such as @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) , @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) , @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) and @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "in addition , charged @xmath94 decays such as @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) , @xmath122 ( @xmath115 ) can be also used .",
    "there should be enough tracks which can be used to determine the @xmath94 ( or @xmath86 ) decay vertex . here",
    "not only is the background level around the @xmath86 primary vertex intrinsically low , but also the backgrounds can be further reduced by the @xmath94 mass constraint as one can fully reconstruct the @xmath94 decays ( unlike in the @xmath109 case ) .",
    "note that this is similar to the idea  @xcite of using @xmath123 to tag @xmath124 .",
    "one major difference is that @xmath125 production cross section is unknown and could be very low , while one expects more than @xmath126 @xmath94 produced at tevatron and lhc which can be potentially used for @xmath0 mixing search .",
    "we have briefly discussed some possible techniques which can be used for mixing searches in the future .",
    "they can be roughly divided into two classes : hadronic and semi - leptonic .",
    "each method has advantages and limitations . in the case of semi - leptonic method",
    ", the advantage is that it is theoretically clean as there is no dcsd involved while the limitation is that very often it is limited by large background due to the missing neutrino . in the case of @xmath127 ,",
    "the major complication is the presence of dcsd .",
    "however , this very complication can be turned to advantage since the potentially small mixing signature could show up in the interference term ( at lower decay times ) .",
    "the design of future experiments should focus on improving the vertexing capabilities and reducing the background level around the primary vertex , in order to fully take advantage of having the possible dcsd and mixing interference .",
    "in addition , we have learned that the very complication due to the possible differences between the resonant substructure in many dcsd and mixing decay modes @xmath128 could also , in principle , be turned to advantage by providing additional information .    in the case of @xmath127 and @xmath129",
    ", we are only measuring @xmath15 . since many extensions of the standard model",
    "predict large @xmath5 , and we expect new physics does not affect the decays in a significant way thus does not contribute to @xmath77 , it is important to measure @xmath130 and @xmath77 separately .",
    "fortunately , decays such as @xmath21 , can provide us information on @xmath77 .",
    "observation of a non - zero @xmath77 would demonstrate mixing caused by the decay rate difference .",
    "this , together with the information on @xmath131 obtained from other methods , we can in effect measure @xmath130 . it is worth to point out here that @xmath130 and @xmath77 are expected to be at the same level within the standard model , however we do not know for sure exactly at what level since theoretical calculations for the long distance contribution are still plagued by large uncertainties .",
    "therefore , it is very important to measure @xmath77 in order to understand the size of @xmath130 within the standard model , so that when @xmath132 mixing is finally observed experimentally , we will know whether we are seeing the standard model physics or new physics beyond the standard model .",
