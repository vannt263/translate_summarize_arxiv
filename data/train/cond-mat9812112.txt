    "it is well known that a long flexible linear polymer in a good solvent with an attractive short  range force between the polymer and the container wall undergoes an adsorption transition @xcite .",
    "a good model for this phenomenon is a self - avoiding random walk ( saw ) on some lattice with an adsorbing surface ( boundary ) . in this model",
    "each monomer ( step ) in the bulk has a boltzmann weight @xmath1 , whereas the interaction with the adsorbing wall is taken into account by assigning an energy @xmath2 to each monomer that is found at the surface . for temperatures @xmath3 higher than the critical temperature @xmath4 of the adsorption ,",
    "the polymer is in a desorbed phase , and for @xmath5 it is in an adsorbed phase . at the adsorption transition",
    "the number @xmath6 of adsorbed monomers scales with the total number @xmath7 of monomers as @xmath8 , where @xmath0 is the crossover exponent .",
    "the above model has been widely studied on various lattices and via a number of techniques ( @xcite and references therein ) . for two - dimensional euclidean lattices",
    "exact results were found through conformal field theory @xcite and much numerical work was completed using monte carlo @xcite , exact enumeration @xcite , transfer matrix @xcite , series expansion @xcite and renormalization group @xcite techniques .",
    "bouchaud and vannimenus @xcite developed a real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) approach to study the critical adsorption of saw on finitely ramified fractal lattices ( which may serve as crude models for real amorphous materials ) .",
    "in addition to some other results , these authors found the exact values of the crossover exponent @xmath0 for the case of two and three  dimensional sierpinski gaskets ( sg ) .",
    "the rsrg method @xcite was applied on other fractals , in particular on other members of the two  dimensional sg fractal family @xcite , in order to find out how the crossover exponent changes when properties of the fractal are systematically changed .",
    "members of this family can be labeled by an integer @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , and for large values of @xmath9 the underlying lattice structure becomes more and more similar to a triangular wedge , while its fractal dimension tends to its euclidean value 2 .",
    "due to the extraordinary complexity of the underlying combinatorial problem , exact crossover exponents @xmath0 were found @xcite only for @xmath11 . for larger values of @xmath9 the monte carlo renormalization group ( mcrg )",
    "method @xcite was developed , and the limit @xmath12 was analyzed within the finite  size scaling hypothesis @xcite , with the conclusion that @xmath0 does not tend to its euclidean value @xmath13 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we apply the rsrg method to calculate the crossover exponent @xmath0 for the previously introduced @xcite nontrivial class of saw , so ",
    "called piecewise directed walk ( pdw ) on the two  dimensional sg family of fractals . for one type ( pdw1 ) of this model",
    "we were able to find @xmath0 exactly for the entire sg family , whereas in the other case ( pdw2 ) we found exact values of @xmath0 for @xmath14 .",
    "comparing our results with the results obtained for the common saw model on the same fractal family @xcite for @xmath15 we find that for each @xmath9 the values of @xmath0 for both models are very close .",
    "this is not surprising since attractive wall at the fractal boundary brings anisotropy in saw paths which is similar to the effects of the directedness imposed on random walks in pdw models . in other words",
    ", it seems plausible to accept that disallowed directions does not significantly contribute to the values of @xmath0 for the saw model ( especially for large values of @xmath9 ) , which means that crossover exponent @xmath0 calculated for the pdw model(s ) can be considered as a good approximation for the @xmath0 values for saw on sg fractals .",
    "then , asymptotic analysis of the exact pdw results can also provide good insight into the crossover region @xmath12 for the saw model , which might help in resolving the subtle problem of the limiting behaviour of the critical properties of statistical systems on fractals when underlying fractal parameters approach the corresponding euclidean values @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall the definition of the pdw model and present the framework of the rsrg calculation of @xmath0 for the case under study . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we present our results for @xmath0 , together with the analysis of the asymptotic behaviour in the limit @xmath12 , in the case of pdw1 and pdw2 , respectively .",
    "finally , in section 5 we discuss all our findings and related results obtained by other authors .",
    "in this section we are going to apply the rsrg method to the pdw adsorption problem on the sg family of fractals .",
    "we start with recalling the basic properties of well  known sg fractals introduced by given and mandelbrot @xcite .",
    "each member of the sg fractal family ( labeled by @xmath9 ) can be constructed recursively , starting with an equilateral triangle ( generator @xmath16 ) that contains @xmath17 smaller equilateral triangles .",
    "the subsequent fractal stages are constructed self  similarly , by replacing each of the @xmath18 upward  oriented small triangles of the initial generator by a new generator . to obtain the @xmath19th  stage fractal lattice @xmath20 , which we shall call the generator of order @xmath19 , this process of construction has to be repeated @xmath21 times , and the complete fractal is obtained in the limit @xmath22 .",
    "the fractal dimension of the sg fractal with spatial scaling factor @xmath9 is given by @xmath23/\\ln b$ ] .",
    "in the case under study , it is assumed that one side of the fractal is an impenetrable attractive wall .    the first type  pdw1  of the pdw model is defined @xcite by requiring that within each generator of any order of a given sg fractal the self  avoiding walker makes random steps in only three directions : the main one ( randomly chosen ) , and the two neighboring ( obtained by rotating the main direction by @xmath24 ) . in the case of a generator with @xmath25 ,",
    "one step is related to passing through one physically present unit triangle , whereas in the case of a generator with @xmath26 a step should be related to the coarse  grained walk through the underlying fractal structure .",
    "the pdw2 type @xcite is defined in a similar way : within each generator of any order four directions , determined by the point of entering a generator , are allowed ( see figure 1 ) .    to calculate the critical exponent @xmath0 by means of the rsrg approach ,",
    "it is necessary to consider three restricted partition functions : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , defined as weighted sums over all corresponding never  starting and never  ending pdws for the given stage @xmath19 of the iterative construction of the lattice ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the recursive nature of the fractal under consideration implies the following general form of the recursion relations : @xmath30 where we have used the prime symbol as a superscript for the @xmath31th - order functions and no indices for the @xmath19th - order functions .",
    "the coefficients @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the numbers of ways in which the corresponding part of the pdw , within an @xmath31th - stage fractal structure , can be comprised of the pdws within the fractal structures of the next lower order .",
    "then , following the rsrg procedure @xcite , one should find the symmetric fixed point @xmath35 of the rsrg transformation ( [ eq : rgb ] ) , which corresponds to the adsorption ",
    "desorption transition at temperature @xmath36 , linearize the rsrg transformation at that point , and find the relevant eigenvalues .",
    "finally , the crossover exponent @xmath0 is determined through the formula @xmath37 where @xmath38 is @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the larger eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath41",
    "it was found earlier @xcite that the first rsrg equation in ( [ eq : rgb ] ) in the case of pdw1 for any sg fractal has the following explicit form @xmath42 so that @xmath38 ( [ eq : lambdanu ] ) is equal to @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the unique positive fixed point of the transformation ( [ eq : rg1pdw1 ] ) .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : rg1pdw1 ] ) was derived using more general partition functions @xmath45 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes number of all possible pdw1 paths with @xmath48 steps in the bulk , starting at the origin @xmath49 and ending at the point @xmath50 in figure 3 , assuming that the weight of a step in the bulk is @xmath51 .",
    "similarly , the explicit form of the matrix * a * ( [ eq : a ] ) can be established by introducing general partition functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 , and @xmath56 denote numbers of all possible pdw1 paths with @xmath48 steps in the bulk , @xmath57 steps at the wall , and @xmath58 steps in the layer adjacent to the wall , again starting at the origin @xmath49 and ending at the point @xmath50 in figure 3 , with the additional assumptions that the weight of a step at the wall is @xmath59 , and in the layer adjacent to the wall  @xmath60 .",
    "one can observe that for @xmath61 and @xmath62 generating functions @xmath63 are : @xmath64 whereas for @xmath65 ( see figure 3(a ) ) the following relations are valid : @xmath66 starting with the above equations , one can show ( see [ app : prvi ] ) that elements @xmath67 and @xmath68 of the matrix * a * ( [ eq : a ] ) are equal to : @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes that partial derivatives are calculated at the symmetric fixed point @xmath72",
    ". as one can see on figure 3(b ) , the restricted partition function @xmath73 for the sg fractal labeled by @xmath9 is @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 as was shown in @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath77 which can be put ( see [ app : drugi ] ) in the following form @xmath78 for the last element @xmath79 of the matrix * a * ( [ eq : a ] ) we have @xmath80 from ( [ eq : rec1 ] ) , with @xmath81 and @xmath82 , we get @xmath83 so that @xmath84 is equal to : @xmath85 since @xmath44 is the unique positive fixed point of the rsrg equation @xmath86 , where @xmath87 , from ( [ eq : zzz2 ] ) directly follows that @xmath88    the explicit values of fixed points @xmath44 and eigenvalues @xmath38 were found in @xcite for @xmath14 and for several larger values of @xmath9 .",

    "these values are compared with the theoretical values obtained via the asymptotic analysis for large @xmath9 , which we are going to present now .    for large values of @xmath9",
    ", introducing new variable @xmath94 the summation over @xmath95 in equation ( [ eq : a11 ] ) can be replaced by integration over @xmath1 .",
    "then , by the use of the stirling formula for large @xmath58 , that is @xmath96 in binomial coefficients , element @xmath97 can be written in the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 is @xmath100 since @xmath9 is considered to be very large the integral in equation ( [ eq : inta11 ] ) is treated here by the use of the steepest - descent method expanding the integrand around the minimum of @xmath99 , which occurs at @xmath101 , so that @xmath97 can be expressed as @xmath102 by similar arguments , in ref .",
    "@xcite was shown that the first equation in rsrg transformation ( [ eq : rgb ] ) can be put in the form @xmath103 for large @xmath9 , where @xmath104 has its minimum at @xmath105 .",
    "it is trivial to show that @xmath106 and @xmath107 , for @xmath108 .",
    "then , by direct comparison of equations ( [ eq : enda11 ] ) and ( [ eq : capelrg ] ) , one can see that @xmath109 since @xmath110 if @xmath108 , and @xmath111 ( which was also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in a quite similar way from equation ( [ eq : a12 ] ) follows @xmath112 whereas from equation ( [ eq : a21 ] ) one gets @xmath113 then , the largest eigenvalue @xmath40 of the matrix @xmath114 ( [ eq : a ] ) is approximately equal to @xmath115 for @xmath116 , where @xmath117 @xmath118    using asymptotic behaviour of @xmath38 , which has also been treated in @xcite , i.e. @xmath119 together with ( [ eq : lfi ] ) and ( [ eq : phi ] ) , we finally get the following expression for the crossover exponent @xmath120 the exponent @xmath0 given by ( [ eq : asymphi1 ] ) is represented as the dashed curve in figure 4 , and one can see that agreement with the exact results is quite satisfactory . in the same figure ,",
    "we have presented the lower @xmath121 and the upper @xmath122 bounds @xmath123 for the crossover exponent @xmath0 , established in a heuristic way by bouchaud and vannimenus in @xcite . in the above bounds @xmath124 is the fractal dimension of the adsorbing surface , i.e. @xmath125 for our model , whereas @xmath126 , the critical exponent of the end - to - end distance of walk in the bulk , is equal to @xmath127 .",
    "one can observe that our results satisfy the condition @xmath128 for any @xmath9 , which is not the case for the saw model with no constraints ( see figure 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "for the pdw2 model in the bulk it is enough to say that within each generator of any order of a given fractal the walker makes random steps represented only by the set of four vectors which corresponds to the place of his entering the generator ( see figure 1(b ) ) , and it is not relevant which end of the walk is starting point .",
    "this is not the case in the vicinity of the adsorbing wall .",
    "see , for instance , two configurations in figure 5 , which are symmetric under change of orientation of the walk .",
    "if the wall is not present both of them represent pdw2 walks , and contribute the rg equation for the @xmath129 parameter with the same term @xmath130 . when the wall is present these two configurations contribute the @xmath131 parameter , first with the term @xmath132 , and second with @xmath133 , so it is obvious that the pdw2 definition in the case of adsorption should be completed to avoid such ambiguities . in that sense ,",
    "two types of pdw2 walks are possible .",
    "we shall denote them by abbreviations pdw2a and pdw2b , and describe in the following way :    * pdw2a model ",
    "parts of the pdw2a walks that traverse generators lying on the adsorbing wall are oriented in such a way that their entrance point is always on the wall ( first example in figure 5 ) ; * pdw2b model  entrance point of the pdw2b walks that traverse generators lying on the adsorbing wall is always in the bulk ( second example in figure 5 ) .    as in the case of the pdw1 model ,",
    "it is useful to introduce analogous partition functions @xmath45 ,",
    "@xmath63 , and @xmath134 for both pdw2 models .",
    "functions @xmath45 were already introduced in reference @xcite , but no closed form expression for them were found .",
    "nevertheless , these functions , as well as their derivatives , obey certain recursive relations , by the use of which one can numerically find fixed points @xmath44 of the rsrg transformation @xmath86 ( [ eq : rgb ] ) and the eigenvalues @xmath135 ( [ eq : lambdanu ] ) , for very large values of the sg fractal parameter @xmath9 @xcite . here",
    "we shall describe the algorithm for numerical determining the elements of the matrix * a * ( [ eq : a ] ) .    for both versions of the pdw2 model the rsrg transformation of the function @xmath136 , for any @xmath9 ,",
    "can be expressed as @xmath137 , so that elements @xmath97 and @xmath138 of the matrix * a * ( [ eq : a ] ) are equal to @xmath139 where we have used short labeling @xmath140 it is not difficult to check that for @xmath61 and @xmath62 generating functions @xmath63 are : @xmath141 whereas for @xmath65 the following relations are valid : @xmath142 as one can see on figure 6(a ) . from these equations",
    "one obtains recursive relations for the derivatives @xmath143 and @xmath144 : @xmath145 and @xmath146 then , starting from the initial values @xmath147 with @xmath108 , for any @xmath9 one can iterate relations ( [ eq : pdw2rec1 ] ) , ( [ eq : pdw2rec2 ] ) and ( [ eq : pdw2rec3 ] ) , and obtain values of the elements @xmath97 and @xmath138 ( [ eq : vrsta1 ] ) .",
    "one can observe that for the pdw2a model @xmath148 so that elements @xmath149 and @xmath84 are equal to @xmath150 which can also be obtained by the use of recursion relations ( [ eq : pdw2rec1 ] ) , ( [ eq : pdw2rec2 ] ) and ( [ eq : pdw2rec3 ] ) .    in the case of the pdw2b model @xmath151 and @xmath152",
    "function @xmath153 satisfies the relation @xmath154 as can bee seen from figure 6(b ) .",
    "then , from ( [ eq : vrsta2 ] ) directly follows @xmath155 together with @xmath156 the form of the @xmath84 can be further simplified , since the sum on the right side of the last equation is equal to @xmath157 , which is direct consequence of relations ( [ eq : pdw2rec1 ] ) with @xmath81 .",
    "finally , we obtain @xmath158 since @xmath159 .    in figure 7(a ) we present larger eigenvalue @xmath40 of the matrix * a * ( 4 ) for sg fractals with @xmath160 for both pdw2 models ( elements of the matrix * a * were calculated by the use of the previously found @xcite fixed points @xmath44 ) .",
    "it seems that @xmath40 tends to some finite constant when @xmath12 , for both cases , which was also supported by numerical analysis of the obtained data .",
    "furthermore , previous numerical analysis of pdw2 @xmath38 eigenvalues @xcite revealed that @xmath161 for large @xmath9 , which means that crossover exponent @xmath0 ( [ eq : phi ] ) tends to 0 as const@xmath162 .",
    "that conclusion is in accord with figure 7(b ) , where calculated values of @xmath0 are depicted as functions of @xmath163 . in the same figure",
    "one can also see that , as in the pdw1 case , bouchaud  vannimenus boundaries ( [ eq : bounds ] ) are obeyed .",
    "for the sake of a better review of global behaviour of @xmath0 as function of the fractal parameter @xmath9 , when number of allowed directions grows from three ( pdw1 model ) to six ( saw model ) , in figure 8 we present our exact results for all pdw models , together with the exact ( @xmath11 , @xcite ) and available monte carlo ( @xmath164 , @xcite ) saw results . for all considered @xmath9 , crossover exponents @xmath0 are very close for all these models , being monotonically decreasing functions of @xmath9 .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath165 values of @xmath0 for pdw1 , pdw2b and saw are almost the same ( see the inset in figure 8) , whereas pdw2a values slightly departure from them . for smaller values of @xmath9 ( @xmath166 ) inequality",
    "@xmath167 holds , whereas for larger @xmath9 ( @xmath168 ) , one can observe @xmath169 . as @xmath9 becomes",
    "larger @xmath0 values for all three pdw models become closer , indicating that main contribution to the value of @xmath0 comes from walks with steps in three directions allowed in the pdw1 model .",
    "the fact that pdw2a values of @xmath0 are always smaller than pdw2b values means that the fourth direction in the pdw2a model ( which is forbidden to the pdw1 walker ) moves the walker more efficiently from the adsorbing wall , than the corresponding direction in the pdw2b model ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "good illustration for the interplay between the effects of increasing @xmath9 and changing the number of step directions is the relationship between pdw1 and pdw2b data : for smaller @xmath9 values , i.e. for smaller fractal generators , there is not enough space for the fourth direction to move the walker away from the adsorbing wall ( so @xmath170 ) , which is not the case in larger generators ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "exponent @xmath0 for saw model decreases with @xmath9 more rapidly than for any other model considered here . for smaller @xmath9 exponent",
    "@xmath172 is close to the corresponding pdw1 and pdw2b values , then , as @xmath9 grows , @xmath172 approaches pdw2a values , and starting from @xmath173 drops even bellow them . one could expect that this trend will continue for @xmath174 , since increasing of @xmath9 makes relatively more steps available in the bulk for the walk to spread , than on the surface .",
    "however , according to finite - size scaling prediction @xcite , @xmath0 should tend to @xmath175 when @xmath12 , which means that @xmath172 should have minimum ( at least one ) for some @xmath174 , and the same conclusion holds if one accepts the hypothesis that @xmath172 tends to its euclidean value @xmath13 .",
    "there is still no firm evidence that either of these assumptions is correct .",
    "on the other hand , in this paper we have analytically proven that @xmath176 , and numerically shown that @xmath177 , whereas the value of @xmath0 for directed walk model on euclidean lattices @xcite is equal to 1/2 ( see appendix c ) , as for saw model .",
    "since pdw walks become directed in the limit @xmath12 , these results definitely mean that crossover exponent @xmath0 on fractals does not necessarily approach its euclidean value and , also , give support to our expectation that @xmath178 .",
    "whether this expectation is correct or not , we believe that pdw models , being tractable for very large values of @xmath9 , may serve as excellent toy models for checking the validity of the finite - size scaling hypothesis and the rgmc results for random walk models on fractals .    at the end one can pose the question about the dependence of the crossover exponent @xmath0 on the fractal properties . there is no simple function of a limited set of the fractal characteristics with which @xmath0 can be described , however , on the basis of equation ( [ eq : asymphi1 ] ) and numerical analysis of the pdw2 data , we can say that behaviour of @xmath0 at the fractal to euclidean lattice crossover is governed by the factor @xmath179 , i.e. with the fractal dimension .",
    "similar behaviour was found for the pdw critical exponent @xmath126 @xcite , which approaches its euclidean value @xmath180 with the correction term proportional to @xmath163 .",
    "it is interesting to note here that direct consequence of these two findings ",
    "relation @xmath181 , was also predicted by the finite - size scaling method for the saw model @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the lower bouchaud  vannimenus boundary @xmath121 ( [ eq : bounds ] ) behaves as @xmath182 for large @xmath9 , and for all pdw models considered here exponent @xmath0 approaches @xmath121 when @xmath12 .",
    "the same holds for saw model on @xmath58simplex fractals @xcite , i.e. @xmath183 when @xmath184 , and in the case of simple random walks on @xmath185dimensional sierpinski gaskets @xmath0 is exactly equal to the lower boundary , for any @xmath185 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these cases , bouchaud  vannimenus boundaries are violated for the saw on sierpinski fractals @xcite , as well as in some other models @xcite .",
    "further comparative analysis of all these cases should be done in order to make the only known limits for the crossover exponent @xmath0 more precise , which will be a matter for future study .",
