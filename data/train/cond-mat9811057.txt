    "entangled star polymers have the unique property that the viscosity does not increase with a power law of the molecular weight , as found for linear polymers , but instead increases exponentially .",
    "this experimental result was first reported by kraus and gruver @xcite and subsequently confirmed by many others @xcite .",
    "theoretical explanations have been given based on extensions of the reptation model @xcite .",
    "an essential assumption made by adapting the reptation model to entangled stars is that the dominating mechanism for translational motion is the retraction of ends of the arms along their average contour , with the simultaneous projection of unentangled loops into the surrounding matrix . as the arms retract the free energy increases due to the loss of configurational entropy .",
    "de gennes @xcite was the first to explore this problem using a lattice model defined in the next section .",
    "he calculated the number of walks for each tube length and concluded that the time required to retract one arm completely would increase exponentially with the arm length @xmath4 .",
    "in a subsequent approach doi and kuzuu @xcite obtained the time dependence of the star relaxation .",
    "the doi - kuzuu theory predicts that the longest relaxation time @xmath5 increases exponentially with the molecular weight and has a power law prefactor @xmath6 the power law exponent @xmath7 has been predicted by doi and kuzuu @xcite to @xmath8 , by pearson and helfand @xcite to @xmath9 , and has been estimated by needs and edwards @xcite using monte carlo methods to @xmath10 .",
    "the exponential factor @xmath11 has been calculated by helfand and pearson  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the lattice coordination number . in the present case of the simple cubic lattice one has @xmath14 and thus @xmath15 .",
    "the numerical estimate of @xmath16 by needs and edwards  @xcite is significantly smaller than this . since during the time @xmath5 the star polymer diffuses by a tube diameter , which is in the order of unity in our lattice model",
    ", one can use the relation @xmath17 between the terminal relaxation time @xmath5 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath18 in order to obtain @xmath19 using monte carlo simulations needs and edwards @xcite found @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23 .    with respect to the conflicting estimates of @xmath7 and @xmath11",
    "we have attempted to clarify this situation by simulating again the lattice model proposed by de gennes .",
    "the advance in computers combined with a highly optimized multispin coding technique allows us to simulate over time scales that are several orders of magnitude longer than previous simulations @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have addressed the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the number of arms @xmath2 .",
    "we simulate a model for a polymer in a gel that was introduced by de gennes . in this model",
    "@xcite , a star polymer with @xmath2 arms and arm length @xmath4 is represented by @xmath24 monomers on a 3d cubic lattice , connected by a sequence of @xmath25 steps on lattice edges .",
    "one elementary move in this model is made by randomly selecting one monomer , and attempting to move it .",
    "if all steps connecting the monomer are located on the same edge , it will randomly move to one of the six possible lattice sites ( the site it is already in , and five new ones ) .",
    "the rate of any monomer to move to any allowed lattice site is once per time unit .",
    "a configuration of a three - legged star polymer in the two - dimensional version of this model is illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "in this configuration , monomers 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 , 9 , and 14 can move to three other locations , the other monomers are frozen .",
    "note that all our simulations were done in the three - dimensional model .",
    "a straightforward way to store the configuration of the polymer would be to store the coordinates of all the monomers .",
    "however , a more efficient implementation of the algorithm can be obtained by storing the coordinates of the central monomer only , plus for each arm the sequence of steps taken from this center .",
    "in one elementary move in a direct implementation of the dynamics , randomly one of the @xmath24 monomers is chosen and proposed to move .    *",
    "\\(a ) the central monomer can only move if the first steps of all arms are in the same direction ; in this case , these steps will be replaced by a randomly chosen direction , and the coordinates of the central monomer are updated . *",
    "\\(b ) one of the end monomers can always move , and the last step is replaced by a random direction . *",
    "\\(c ) any other monomer can only move if the two steps connected to it are opposites . in this case , these steps are replaced by a pair of randomly chosen opposite steps .    to obtain that each of the @xmath26 possible moves is tried with unit rate",
    ", one elementary move corresponds to a time increment of @xmath27 .",
    "it turns out that the diffusion coefficient decays exponentially with arm length , requiring a very efficient implementation of the algorithm to extract reliable numerical results .",
    "we achieve that by using multispin coding , enabling us to make about seven million elementary moves per second per processor on a sg 200 workstation . in the past , we simulated the repton model proposed by rubinstein @xcite with the same approach in an electric field  @xcite , and in the absence of an electric field  @xcite , and de gennes model for linear polymers  @xcite .",
    "the processors are 64-bit , allowing for 64 concurrent simulations . for each of the 64 simulations , we store the coordinates of central monomer as @xmath28 .",
    "suppose that we denote the @xmath29 bit of long integer @xmath30 as @xmath31 , then step @xmath32 in arm @xmath33 of simulation @xmath34 is stored in the three bits @xmath35^k , b[if+j]^k , c[if+j]^k\\}$ ] ; if the step is in the positive @xmath36- , @xmath37- , or @xmath38-direction , this triplet is equal to \\{1,0,0 } , \\{0,1,0 } or \\{0,0,1 } , respectively ; the negative directions are represented by \\{0,1,1 } , \\{1,0,1 } , and \\{1,1,0 } , respectively .",
    "note that opposite steps are each other s binary complement .",
    "the core of the program , that proposes moves of monomers other than the central and end monomers simultaneously in all 64 simulations , can then be written ( in the programming language c ) as :    0.2 in flip=(a[p]@xmath39a[q])&(b[p]@xmath39b[q])&(c[p]@xmath39c[q ] ) ; + nf= @xmath40flip ; + a[p]=(a[p]&nf ) | ( rnda & flip ) ; + b[p]=(b[p]&nf ) | ( rndb & flip ) ; + c[p]=(c[p]&nf ) | ( rndc & flip ) ; + a[q]=(a[q]&nf ) | ( ( @xmath40rnda)&flip ) ; + b[q]=(b[q]&nf ) | ( ( @xmath40rndb)&flip ) ; + c[q]=(c[q]&nf ) | ( ( @xmath40rndc)&flip ) ; 0.2 in    here , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are steps connected to the same monomer , the symbols @xmath39 , @xmath43 , @xmath40 and @xmath44 denote respectively the exclusive - or , and , not and or operations , and the triplet @xmath45 represents a random direction .",
    "similar statements can be written down for the central and end monomers .",
    "the star polymers were simulated over a long time @xmath46 ( around @xmath47 for the longest arm lengths ) , and the coordinates of the central monomers were written to a file at regular times .",
    "afterwards , a quick estimate for the diffusion coefficient from @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 ; with this quick estimate we determined the time interval @xmath51 after which the mean square displacement of the center equals the arm length @xmath4 , and performed a better estimate of @xmath18 using the same equation with @xmath52 , averaged over all @xmath53 .",
