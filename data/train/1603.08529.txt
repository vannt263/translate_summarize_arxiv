    "young brown dwarfs , especially at the latest spectral types , have masses and atmospheres similar to those of directly imaged gas giant exoplanets . isolated young brown dwarfs offer a way to study cool , low - pressure atmospheres of exoplanets without the inherent difficulties of isolating the planet flux from that of a brighter host star . most of the known isolated planetary - mass brown dwarfs have been found through their unusually red optical and near - infrared colors , often in the regions of young stellar associations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "over the past few years , targeted searches have also encompassed the position - velocity phase spaces of nearby young stellar associations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , most notably with the bayesian analysis for nearby young associations ( banyan ) tool @xcite .",
    "these have helped recognize or discover the lowest - mass isolated brown dwarfs in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we conducted a comprehensive program to purposefully seek l and t dwarfs with unusual optical / infrared colors in the combined set of sdss , 2mass , and wise data .",
    "we did not impose positional or space velocity constraints , in order to obtain an unbiased assessment of ultra - cool dwarfs with peculiar spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "one of the newly discovered objects was the extremely red ( @xmath4  mag ) l7 candidate low - gravity dwarf 2mass  j11193254@xmath51137466 ( henceforth , 2mass  j11191137 ) . at @xmath6  mag in the vista hemisphere survey ( vhs ; pi mcmahon , cambridge , uk )",
    ", a confirmation of its youth would place it among the brightest isolated planetary - mass objects , making it exceptionally suitable for investigating exoplanetary atmospheres in detail .",
    "herein we report the spectroscopic confirmation of the low surface gravity of 2mass  j11191137 , its kinematic association with the tw hydrae association ( twa ; @xcite ) , and hence its planetary mass .",
    "to confirm the youth of 2mass  j11191137 , we obtained low - resolution spectra with flamingos-2 @xcite on the gemini - south telescope through fast turnaround program gs-2015b - ft-5 .",
    "the spectrum revealed weaker gravity - sensitive k i absorption lines than in a typical field - age late - l dwarf indicating that 2mass  j11191137  is young ( e.g. @xcite ) . because of unresolved spectrophotometric systematics , namely an extremely red spectral slope and unexpectedly deep oh absorption bands inconsistent with our spex spectrum @xcite , we do not present the f-2 spectrum here .",
    "we subsequently obtained an @xmath7@xmath86000 , 0.82.45@xmath9 m spectrum with the folded - port infrared echellette ( fire ; @xcite ) at the magellan baade telescope on 2016 january 21 .",
    "it is this spectrum that we use for the surface gravity and radial velocity analysis presented herein .",
    "we observed the target at the parallactic angle ( pa ) @xmath8226 , at an airmass of 1.171.05 with good weather conditions and a seeing of @xmath805 .",
    "the echelle disperser was used in conjunction with the sample up the ramp ( sutr ) readout and high - gain ( 1.3e-/dn ) modes . a single 900s exposure and six 600s exposures",
    "were obtained for a total integration time of 1.25hr , which yielded a signal - to - noise ratios of @xmath81070 per pixel in the 1.12.2@xmath9 m range .",
    "we observed the a0 standard hd  85056 immediately afterwards at a similar airmass ( 1.081.09 ) .",
    "we used thar calibration lamps ( 10s exposure times ) , observed in the middle and at the end of the science sequence , and again after the telluric standard , to ensure a proper wavelength calibration .",
    "a total of eleven internal high - signal flats ( 1s exposures with high - voltage lamps ) and eleven low - signal flats ( 10s exposures with low - voltage lamps ) were obtained at the beginning of the night : high - signal flats provide a good pixel response calibration in the blue orders , whereas low - signal flats are used for the red orders .",
    "five 4s dome flats were also obtained to characterize the slit illumination function .",
    "we reduced the data using the interactive data language ( idl ) pipeline firehose , which is based on the mase @xcite and spextool @xcite packages .",
    "the pipeline was modified to achieve a better rejection of bad pixels ( i.e. , see @xcite ) .",
    "this reduction package includes a barycentric velocity correction and converts the wavelength solution to vacuum .",
    "to determine if 2mass  j11191137  is young , we focused our analysis on the gravity - sensitive k i absorption lines ( 1.1692 and 1.1778@xmath9 m , 1.2437 and 1.2529@xmath9 m ) .",
    "our fire spectrum has 40 times the resolution of our previous spex prism spectrum @xcite , allowing us to directly compare the strength of the spectral features to those of young and field - age late - l dwarfs .",
    "the top panels of figure [ fig : youth ] show sections of our fire spectrum ( black ) compared to fire spectra of the young l7 dwarf pso  j318.5338@xmath522.8603 ( green ; hereafter pso  j318.5@xmath522 ; @xcite ) and the field - aged l7.5 dwarf luhman 16a ( blue ; @xcite ) centered on the k i lines .",
    "the k i lines in the 2mass  j11191137  spectrum are weaker than in luhman 16a , indicating low surface gravity and hence a young age ( @xmath10  200 myr ; @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , the k i line strengths of 2mass  j11191137  and pso j318.5@xmath522 are indistinguishable from each other .",
    "the two objects are among the reddest isolated l dwarfs known to date .",
    "the equivalent widths of the k i lines as defined by @xcite for 2mass  j11191137  ( @xmath11@xmath12 at 1.1168@xmath9 m ; @xmath13@xmath12 at 1.1177@xmath9 m ; @xmath14@xmath12 at 1.1243@xmath9 m ; and @xmath15@xmath12 at 1.1254@xmath9 m ) are systematically lower than those of field l7 dwarfs ( e.g. , see @xcite , figure 15 ) .",
    "the complete @xmath16 , 0.7@xmath52.4 @xmath9 m fire spectrum of 2mass  j11191137  is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : youth ] , where it is seen to be significantly redder than the near - ir spectrum of the field - aged l7.5 dwarf luhman 16a .",
    "the combined evidence leads us to conclude that 2mass  j11191137  is indeed young , and comparable in age to the 23 myr - old @xmath17 pictoris association member pso j318.5@xmath522 . at the current signal - to - noise ratios and resolutions , we can not determine if one object is younger than the other from the spectra alone . from this comparison , together with the very red color and the consistency of various spectral features and indices with other young , late - l dwarfs @xcite",
    ", we conclude that 2mass  j11191137  has low surface gravity and is likely @xmath10  120 myr old .",
    "we used single - exposure , single - order and telluric - corrected fire spectra to measure the radial velocity of 2mass  j11191137 .",
    "we used a forward modelling approach that relies on the zero - velocity bt - settl atmosphere models to reproduce our observations .",
    "our forward model employs 4 free parameters : a radial velocity shift , an instrumental line spread function ( lsf ) width where the lsf is modelled as a gaussian function , and a two - parameters linear slope multiplicative correction to account for instrumental effects .",
    "we used the idl implementation of amoeba to identify the set of parameters that minimize the reduced @xmath18 between the forward model and the observed spectrum .",
    "this is similar to the algorithm described by @xcite except that telluric absorption was corrected a priori and we did not attempt to measure @xmath19 with the limited resolution of our data .",
    "this optimization was carried out on the 7 individual exposures , in a selected set of wavelength ranges that are located away from order boundaries and in regions where the s / n is high and sufficient radial velocity information is present in the science spectrum .",
    "we selected specific wavelength regions in orders 24 ( 1.0921.120@xmath9 m ) , 17 ( 1.5101.554@xmath9 m ) , 15 ( 1.6801.790@xmath9 m ) , and 13 ( 1.9602.050@xmath9 m ) , that satisfied these criteria .",
    "we used the bt - settl model with @xmath20  = 1600k and @xmath21 , which yielded the smallest reduced @xmath18 in these orders with no velocity shift .",
    "this temperature and surface gravity are in agreement with those found for pso  j318.5@xmath522 @xcite .",
    "we display two example model fits that we obtained in figure  [ fig : modelfit ] .    in each order ,",
    "the useful wavelength range was split in 15 individual segments of width 0.02@xmath9 m to account for sub - pixel systematic effects in the wavelength calibration ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "this yielded a total of 420 individual radial velocity measurements ( 7 exposures , 4 orders and 15 order segments ) .",
    "the single - exposure radial velocities were first combined at every wavelength range using an snr - squared weighted mean .",
    "a weighted standard deviation was used to obtain measurement errors on each of these radial velocity measurements .",
    "this method yielded a weighted - average radial velocity of @xmath22 .",
    "similar radial velocity measurements with fire have been demonstrated to bear a 3  systematic uncertainty ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , which we add in quadrature to our measurement to obtain @xmath0 .    in order to calibrate our method",
    ", we applied it to fire data obtained for pso  j318.5@xmath522 , for the young t5.5 sdss  j111010.01 + 011613.1 @xcite , and for three young m9.5l2 brown dwarfs with keck nirspec radial velocity measurements ( 2mass  j023400936442068 , 2mass  j021038573015313 , 2mass  j232252996151275 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we found measurement discrepancies between 0.5  and 4.4  with a standard deviation of 1.5 , well within our measurement errors .",
    "these data will be detailed in a future publication .",
    "we solved for the proper motion from the 14-year baseline spanned by 2mass , sdss , wise , wise 3-band post - cryo , and neowise - r images , using relative astrometry as prescribed in @xcite .",
    "the total proper motion differs slightly from the measurement in @xcite which was obtained only from the difference between the 2mass and allwise positions .",
    "we used our radial velocity measurement along with the sky position and proper motion of 2mass  j11191137  ( table 1 ) to calculate a young moving group membership probability with the banyan  ii tool ] @xcite .",
    "the banyan ii tool assumes gaussian ellipsoid models adjusted to fit the xyz and uvw distributions of known bona fide members of different moving groups , or the besanon galactic model @xcite for the field hypothesis .",
    "bayes theorem is used to derive a probability density from the comparison of the measurements to the models , and the probability is obtained by marginalizing the probability density function over all possible distances .",

    "although the current model of twa extends its 1@xmath36 contour to only @xmath833 pc , this @xmath825 pc object appears to have been drawn from the same gaussian random distribution in @xmath40 space .",
