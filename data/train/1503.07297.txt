    "traditional filtering is domain filtering which focuses on the closeness by weighing pixel values with coefficients which fall of with distance .",
    "similarly range filtering averages image values with weight that decrease with intensity dissimilarity .",

    "p _ and _ q_. here we need to figure out the original framework from where the bilateral filter equation has been derived .",

    "unlike anisotropic diffusion filtering , the bilateral filter is controlled by only two parameters to control its behavior namely the domain(@xmath43 ) and range kernel(@xmath44 ) standard deviations respectively .",
    "* _ range kernel std .",
    "dev.(@xmath44)_*. with the increase in @xmath44 the filter gradually approximates towards the normal gaussian convolution .",

    "the response of the bilateral filter is the multiplication of its constituent domain and range kernel respectively .",
    "for a large spatial gaussian multiplied with narrow range gaussian achieves limited smoothing in spite of the large spatial extent .",
    "the range weight enforces a strict preservation of the gradient contours .",
    "bilateral filter is inherently non - iterative in nature",
    ". however it can be iterated .",
    "iteration leads to almost piecewise constant result as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iteration ] .",
    "likewise we try to relate the effect of iteration with the varying filter parameters like @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "it has been observed that since @xmath51 and @xmath52 are interlinked the effect of varying one does nt reflect much without the other parameter as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmasr ] .",
    "there is no doubt that the bilateral filter is a very cost effective algorithm to compute specially when the @xmath52 is large as it needs to compute a huge neighborhood of pixels , compute the weights of two parameters @xmath52 and @xmath51 , followed by their product and an expensive normalization step .          as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : separation ] the bilateral filter can decompose an image into two parts namely the filtered image and the subtracted / residual component .",
    "the filtered image contains the large scale features , sacrificing the minute textures respecting the strong edges .",
    "the remnant image left after subtracting the filtered image with the original one , contains only those portions the filter removed , which can be treated further as either as fine textures or noise as the requirement demands .",
    "so we see that bilateral filter provides an efficient way to smooth an image while preserving the edges and has got various efficient numerical schemes to realize the same together with its wide variety of application areas to be discussed in detail in the next subsequent sections .",

    "so for a 10 megapixel photo there is @xmath55 iterations involved which make the system very slow and would approximately take more than 10 minutes to process per image .",
    "+ to achieve the filtering there are several efficient approaches which reply on mathematical approximations yielding similar results with acceleration and accuracy that needs to be discussed in the following subsequent sections .",
    "@xmath56      the brute force approach follows the conventional way ( direct implementation of the bilateral filter ) as discussed with equations 16 to 18 .",
    "its computational complexity is @xmath57 where @xmath58 the size of the spatial domain ( cardinality of @xmath59 ) denoting the number of pixels .",
    "it s clear that the quadratic complexity enhances the computational cost especially for large spatial domains .",
    "so there is a slight modification made with a view to reduce the computational complexity .",
    "the idea is to consider only the neighborhood pixels of the central pixel of interest @xmath53 referring to equation 16 such that @xmath60 considering the contribution of pixels outside the range of 2@xmath52 is negligible because of spatial kernel . the complexity has been decreased to @xmath61 and is only effective for small kernels due to its dependency on @xmath52 .",
    "but for this approach the computational complexity increases to a great extent .",
    "for a 8 megapixel image the number of iterations required is @xmath62 which is obviously not a feasible solution ( for the classical approach ) for implementation in hardware as the computational complexity increases for processing nested loops of pixels .          in this section",
    "we need to discuss the ways to speed - up the bilateral filter and increase it smoothing effect together with its implementation procedure for piece - wise linear signals .",

    "so interestingly it has been observed that their is a good resemblance between bilateral filter equation with that of equation 72 .",
    "it has been observed that the bilateral filtering correlate to a gradient descent of a robust minimization problem . _ the problem definition _ : input is a noisy image @xmath256 .",
    "+ it is required to minimize the discrete equation :    @xmath257    where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are pixel positions and @xmath258 is the neighborhood of @xmath53 , @xmath259 is the weighting function .",
    "the second term of equation 73 is the regularization term which is sensitive to the intensity difference among neighboring pixels , influenced by the function @xmath259 .",
    "this regularization term helps to find out the relationship with bilateral filter . to do that a new reweighed regularization term has been introduced to make the minimization problem",

    "clearly reveals the fact that bilateral filter is a robust filter .",

    "there are several variants and extensions of the most extensively used bilateral filter . to name a few we like to discuss upon them in the next sequel .",
    "+      this trilateral filter as introduced by p.choudhury et al.@xcite in the year 2003 is another variant and an extension of the bilateral filter for edge preserving smoothing operations .",
    "but it is meant for handling @xmath284dimensional signals in multimedia applications . unlike their classical counterparts like anisotropic diffusion and bilateral filter , it is much robust for noise reduction and better outlier rejection in high - gradient regions . + applying the bilateral filter in regions of sharp change in gradient and high gradient areas degrade the smoothing capabilities of the bilateral filter as the rectangular filter extent encloses pixels spanning the peak of the ridge or valley as shown in figure [ fig : fig32 ] . as a result",
    "the filter blends these intensities and results in a blunt feature .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : fig32 ] the spatial extent of the filter can accommodate only a narrow portion of the input signal .",
    "these problems have been addressed by choudhury et al.@xcite by combining modified bilateral filters with a pyramid - based method to limit filter extent .",
    "+ initially they have estimated the slopes of the intensity gradient using bilateral filter followed by tilting the filter extent by an angle @xmath177 pivoting the center point at @xmath285 to cover a wide area of usable domain . .",
    "its tilting vector @xmath286 should average together closely related neighborhood gradients ignoring nearby strongly dissimilar gradient outliers thereby assists in restoring the effectiveness of the spatial filter term .",
    "the tilting vector is given by :    @xmath287    where    @xmath288    @xmath289 denotes the domain of filter window , @xmath290 the range component .",
    "instead of computing a range weight @xmath290 for neighboring @xmath291 by measuring its closeness to the center point value @xmath292 , instead its closeness to a plane through @xmath292 , which acts as a _ centerline _ for the filter window as shown in figure [ fig : fig32]c .",
    "it takes only one user set parameter , filters a signal in a single pass(thus non - iterative ) as needed by most pde based methods .",
    "as already mentioned it can handle @xmath284dimensional signal and provides much better visual quality in applications like texture preserving in contrast reduction problem in digital photography and while denoising polygonal meshes . as shown in figure [ fig : fig33]a and b. as mentioned by w.c.k wong et al.@xcite in their benchmark paper on medical image processing , that a narrow spatial window , say , 3 pixels in each dimension , should be used in order to avoid over - smoothing structures of sizes comparable to the image resolutions as sharp ridges and gutters which are commonly found in biomedical images , such as nested vessels in digital subtraction angiography ( dsa ) and 3d angiography , folded gray and white matters in brain mr imaging . wide spatial window generally over - smooth sharp ridges , gutters and fine textures in an image @xcite .",
    "so a trade - off is necessary to strike a balance between the size of the spatial window and the number of iterations needed to be performed in bilateral filtering .",
    "their results have been shown in figure [ fig : fig34 ] .",
    "+ t.vaudrey et al.@xcite in the year 2009 have shown that the trilateral filtering can further be speeded up several orders of magnitude ( 100 - 1000 times faster ; from hours down to seconds ) by the use of lut(look up table ) and by truncating the lut to a user specified numerical accuracy . referring to equation 82 , @xmath289 ( the spatial weight )",
    "can be pre - calculated using a look - up - table ( lut ) as t depends on the domain kernel standard deviation ( say @xmath293 ) and @xmath294 ( say the kernel size ) and @xmath170(offset from central pixel ) .",
    "_ n.b _ : size of the used filter kernel @xmath295 @xmath294 is the half kernel size and is @xmath296dimensional .",
    "as this function is gaussian , the lut can be computed as :    @xmath297    where @xmath298 @xmath290 can not use a look up table since it is depends on the local neighborhood intensity .",
    "numerical approximation needs to be done .",
    "the lut based approach is a smart truncation of the kernel to a defined accuracy @xmath299 , where @xmath300 .",
    "if any value below @xmath299 needs to be truncated then all the above it should be used given by ,    @xmath301    which leads to @xmath302    where @xmath144 is the threshold .",
    "this approach is not much beneficial to bilateral filtering but upon applying it to trilateral filtering , it reduces the number of computing equations drastically .",
    "this implementation is open to massive parallel processing ( every pixel is independent within the iteration of trilateral filter ) and opens up a huge opportunity for gpu ( graphics processing unit ) based implementation .",

    "the merit of the above approach is that there remains very less probability to miss the edge information present in an image of various spectrum and in light or no - light condition .      for each pixel @xmath53 define a small , simple fixed size neighborhood as shown in fig.[fig : fig36 ] .",

    "kaiming in their paper @xcite proposed a novel explicit image filter called guided filter .",
    "derived from a local linear model , the guided filter computes the filtering output by considering the content of a guidance image , which can be the input image itself or another different image .",
