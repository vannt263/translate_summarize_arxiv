    "the discovery medium is the aao / ukst h@xmath0  survey of the southern galactic plane ( shs hereafter : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whose high sensitivity and fine resolution has been instrumental in the uncovering of low surface brightness h@xmath0   emission associated with both known and newly identified snrs .",

    ", @xcite realised that s284 is also surrounded by non - thermal radio emission .",
    "they then decomposed this   region ( which has an almost flat spectral index ) from the non - thermal component and derived a spectral index @xmath4 for this section .",
    "this is typical of a snr .",
    "they also concluded ( perhaps erroneously ) that there is a physical association between the thermal and non - thermal emission components .    in reality",
    "however , g213.0 - 0.6 is situated somewhat east of s284 ( where most of the faint emission is found ) with an extension of approximately 160@xmath5 .",
    "this can best be seen in the 863  mhz ( using the 100-m effelsberg radio telescope with resolution of some 145 ) maps of @xcite .",
    "these maps also show that a small part of this emission appears to go around the s284  region , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "@xcite also mentioned that this object was also previously seen in the effelsberg galactic surveys at 21 and 11  cm , but there are difficulties with estimating radio spectral indices from this survey .",
    "using their observations and convolved with 2.695  ghz data from the efelsberg s survey they estimated a spectral index ( applying the tt - plot technique ) .",
    "this is in general agreement with the findings of @xcite , again confirming the likely snr nature of this more extended emission .",
    "they also found extended infrared emission north and south of s284 in the iras 60 and 100  @xmath6 m maps of the region and partially overlapping g213.0 - 0.6 .    on the basis of their observations",
    ", @xcite suggested that it is an old supernova remnant , partially shell - like in structure and extremely low in radio surface brightness .",
    "they suggest that if g213.0 - 0.6 is directly interacting with the s284  region ( note an interaction of the thermal and non - thermal emission components is also supported by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the distance to this object could be 2.4  kpc and therefore have a size of .",
    "this would classify this snr among the largest in the galaxy .",
    "the objective of this work is to present the existing radio observations of g213.0 - 0.6 from both the 4850  mhz @xmath15  arcmin resolution parkes - mit - nrao ( pmn ) survey ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the 1400  mhz of 45  arcseconds data from the nrao / vla sky survey ( nvss ) , see @xcite .",
    "this is done in the context of the new h@xmath0  detection of the snr from the shs @xcite so that their inter - relationship is clear .",
    "the optical morphological structure of g213.0 - 0.6 is shown to be very similar to the extant radio morphology seen with both pmn and nvss .",
    "note g213.0 - 0.6 is also detected in the low - resolution but high sensitivity southern h@xmath0  sky survey atlas ( shassa hereafter ) of @xcite also in a coherent shell form ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "we also present our follow - up spectral observations of selected h@xmath0  filaments .",
    "the resultant emission line spectra and diagnostic emission line ratios confirm the presence of shock - ionisation which is typical for snrs .",
    "during systematic searches for optical counterparts to known ( mostly from radio observations ) galactic snrs in the shs ( e.g. see @xcite or @xcite ; @xcite ) we noticed a large shell - like structure of optical filaments and emission clouds some in size on the south - east side of  region s284 .",
    "we associated these with the known snr g213.0 - 0.6 .",
    "the shs h@xmath0  image of g213.0 - 0.6 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where the overall impression is that of an almost complete optical shell consisting of a series of fractured but coherent emission filaments apparently centred on the x - ray source 1rxs j065049.7 - 003220 and iras source 06482 - 0028 ( from simbad ) .",
    "furthermore , the brightest h@xmath0emission occurs in this central area as well as on the north - west side where the shell is apparently closer to s284 .",
    "[ fig1 ] also shows a remarkable extension to the north of the main optical shell in the form of a set of parallel blow - outs  about 30  arcminutes apart with the second , almost one degree from the northern boundary of the shell .",
    "these blow - outs are not common but have sometimes been seen in optical snrs when the emission is mostly fragmented ( unless in the case of a young remnant ) inside the radio borders in the form of optical filaments and emission clouds .",
    "typical examples are g189.1 + 3.0 ( or ic 443 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and g243.9 + 9.6 @xcite .",
    "occasionally , blow - outs can also be seen in the radio morphologies at different frequencies ( an example is g301.4 - 1.0 in * ? ? ?",
    "several faint emission clouds are also present on the south - west side of s284 although any connection of this emission with g213.0 - 0.6 or s284 is dubious . after discovery of this optical shell in the shs we examined the equivalent area in the low resolution but high sensitivity shassa atlas of @xcite .",
    "the shassa survey resolution is only 48  arcsecond / pixel but this has the effect of blending some of the fine h@xmath0  filaments together making the h@xmath0  shell like appearance of this snr even more striking .",
    "indeed at the lowest h@xmath0  contours the emission forms almost a complete optical shell apart from at the location of the blow - out to the north .",
    "this can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ shassa ] and indicates that the optical counterpart to this snr could easily have been discovered in shassa .",
    "we also show a deep , high resolution h@xmath0  image of the s284  region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) where the internal dust lanes and turbulent nature of the emission is shown clearly for the first time and is shown to be completely typical of  regions .",
    "the previous radio observations of the snr also overlapped this object ( most probably due to low angular resolution at the given radio frequencies ) and with other diffuse nebular emission to the north ( especially in the radio observations of * ? ? ?",
    "* where the north - south coverage was 110  arcminutes ) .",
    "the high quality shs h@xmath0  image reveals that s284 actually consists of an approximately circular bright component some 30-arcmin across centred at j2000 .",
    "there is also a fainter , extensive , but coherent emission component extending on 3 sides of the main  region approximately 7  arcminutes to the south , about 10  arcminutes to the west and about 30  arcminutes to the north - west .",
    "the older palomar observatory sky survey ( poss - i ) broad - band red image of this area shows the central bright part with much less detail .",
    "the surrounding more diffuse component is barely detected as a few isolated patches above the noise and with an overall diameter of some 60  arcminutes .",
    "the more recent ukst r - band survey of the region reveals more detail but it is the shs data that finally reveals the clear  region nature of the main component and associated outer region around it .",
    "it is also clear from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the s284 complex is morphologically and spatially distinct from the extended filamentary emission that we associate with the snr .",
    "hence this emission can not be accepted as a part of the snr as has been suggested in the previous radio observations .",
    "the question of any possible interaction between the snr and  region remains .    to the north - west .",
    "the same structure evident in the shs image shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] can be clearly seen , including the parallel emission bars of the northern blow - out 30  arcminutes apart .",
    "two arrows show the locations of these possible blow - outs which can be compared with previous radio images . the main snr optical counterpart could also have been easily discovered in this survey .",
    "the shassa contours are from 150 to 300 decirayleighs ( dr ) where 1  dr = 0.1  r.,width=317,height=313 ]    [ table1 ]    note that our visual searches of the shs uncovered this candidate snr which we then attempted to match against known remnants .",
    "our search was conducted in this fashion so as to be an unbiased trawl for snr candidates from the shs based purely on their optical emission signatures rather than directly searching the shs for matches with known remnants . during subsequent",
    "searching of the pmn 4850  mhz radio survey data for a radio counterpart to this optical candidate we discovered that at this frequency the observed radio flux actually completely followed the h@xmath0  emission .",
    "note that this is not always the case with evolved and old remnants but is common in young snrs .",
    "there was also an excellent match with the optically seen blow - outs to the north ( see right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , from the pmn radio image , it is clear that s284 and g213.0 - 0.6 are clearly separate objects though a possible interaction between them is not completely ruled out ( see later discussion ) .",
    "we note that g213.0 - 0.6 is in the form of a typical shell remnant with a clearly defined arc to the south - east and another one on the north - west which partially deviate from spherical curvature .",
    "the interior region , where the sn explosion occurred , contains a rich chain of arcuate filaments that can be seen in the optical h@xmath0  imagery with a slight difference compared with the radio data .",
    "this is partially due to the median resolution of the pmn survey ( @xmath15  arcmin ) though exact positional correspondence between individual optical and radio filaments is not expected ( e.g. see cram , green & bock , 1998 ) .",
    "note that the radio image does not reveal any point - like sources at this frequency at the proposed new centre of the remnant nor at , or around , the previous g213.3 - 0.4 position . however , x - ray and infrared sources do exist close to the remnants new centre position as previously mentioned . taking into account the large size of this remnant ( @xmath12@xmath7   plus the northern blow - outs ) and the fragmented nature of the clouds and filaments in the higher resolution optical and associated radio data",
    ", we form the overall conclusion that this is an old remnant well on the way to dissolving into and mixing with the ism .",
    "this statement can be confirmed with observations of this object at 1400  mhz ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) from the nvss radio survey where the apparent size and shape are almost identical to both the h@xmath0  and pmn radio data at 4850  mhz .",
    "this match can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] where very low radio emission ( compared with pmn ) is detected at this frequency .",
    "the nvss signal appears strongest across the central and southern parts of the snr and partially over the northern blow - out .",
    "the h@xmath0  flux : @xmath8=1.70@xmath210@xmath9 ; @xmath10=2.02@xmath210@xmath9 ; @xmath11=4.47@xmath210@xmath9 ; @xmath12=3.69@xmath210@xmath13 ; @xmath14=2.96@xmath210@xmath9 in units of erg @xmath15 s@xmath16 @xmath16 + @xmath17note the rms wavelength dispersion error from the arc calibrations was 0.08while the relative percentage error in flux determination from + calibration using brightest lines was estimated as @xmath112% .",
    "+    [ table1 ]      in december 2008 we undertook a series of 5 widely separated optical spectral observations across an area of @xmath12@xmath7   of g213.0 - 0.6 using a ccd spectrograph attached to the 1.9-m radcliffe telescope of south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) , see table 1 .",
    "the slit width was set at @xmath11.5  arcseconds and observations were flux calibrated using photometric standard stars ltt1020 and ltt2415 . to facilitate spectral classification and to evaluate the presence of possible shock signatures which is particularly important for categorization of snrs",
    ", we used a low dispersion grating of 300 lines  mm@xmath16 which covers a range between 3500 and 6900 .",
    "unfortunately , most observations were taken on non - photometric nights so the flux calibration is indicative only and balmer decrement extinctions were not estimated due to concerns of reliability ( see table  2 ) .",
    "moreover , in the blue the ccd on the 1.9-m saao spectrograph has low response and when combined with the non - photometric nights , pushed us to avoid the bluest 1000  of the spectrum between 3500 to 4500  due to the low s / n .",
    "it is possible that some lines in the blue were lost as a result of the poor blue performance and/or extinction .",
    "fortunately , the red part of the spectrum is well covered and is where the key diagnostic lines used to help classify objects as snrs are located ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the line ratios used are based on closely separated lines which means that poor flux calibration is not a serious issue .",
    "the slit positions were carefully chosen to sample the brightest filaments seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , but they are still faint and when coupled with the poor weather and modest blue response led to generally noisy spectra ( see fig .",
    "6 ) but still of sufficient quality to allow essential classification .",
    "the area around g213.0 - 0.6 was reported in the infrared for the first time by @xcite in the survey of galactic supernova remnants using iras data .",
    "@xcite also noted s284 as the infrared source g211.7 - 1.1 and properly concluded that it is an  region .",
    "however , it is not clear if these observations also included g213.0 - 0.6 .",
    "@xcite continued the search for iras supernova remnants , detecting the source g211.7 - 1.1 ( or  region s284 ) and classifying it ( wrongly ) as an snr .",
    "the wide area around g213.0 - 0.6 where the snr is actually situated is not mentioned in @xcite although they compared their infrared detection ( seen in all iras bands ) with radio observations of this region from @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the @xcite radio observations were of low spatial resolution ( @xmath110  arcminutes ) so it is likely that they could not clearly distinguish between the  region and snr in the area . with the better resolution nvss data ( at the same frequency of @xcite observations ) of g213.0 - 0.6 can be noticed over the noise ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , so our statement that @xcite did not notice the remnant due to their low spatial resolution is reasonable as is fact that this region contains two distinct sources , snr g213.0 - 0.6 and  region s284 .    to get better definition of the existing infrared data around g213.0 - 0.6 we used the improved reprocessing of the iras survey data ( or iris ) at 25,60 & 100  @xmath6 m ( resolution from 30  arcsec to 2  arcmin ) .",
    "a large 8  deg region centred on the snr was examined which revealed no clear connection between the clearly related optical and radio data and that from the iris infrared observations .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows a colour , multi - wavelength montage of a 4 degree region around g213.0 - 0.6 .",
    "the pmn 4850  mhz data is red , the iras 60  @xmath6 m data is green while the smoothed h@xmath0   from shassa is blue .",
    "the snr is clearly well detected in the pmn and shassa data while only the  region s284 is seen clearly in the iris 60  @xmath6 m data .",
    "furthermore , the  region itself seems clearly separated from g213.0 - 0.6 calling into doubt any direct connection or interaction as suggested by @xcite .",
    "this throws into consideration doubt making use of the distance to the  region to infer a physical size for the snr ( see discussion ) .",
    "+    examination of the mid - infrared msx ( midcourse space experiment ) survey data at 8.3  @xmath6 m in the area around snr g213.0 - 0.6 did not show any association of 8.3  @xmath6 m emission with optical or radio emission nor with the other three msx wavelengths .",
    "this confirms our expectation that non - thermal emission from this remnant could barely be detected at 8.3  @xmath6 m which is consistent with @xcite .",
    "@xcite also showed that thermal emission from  regions must be detected by msx at 8.3  @xmath6 m , as is clearly seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] where red contours overlaid on the pmn 4850  mhz image mark the emission from s284 .",
    "inspection of recently published preliminary data from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) space mission @xcite also showed no clear detection of g213.0 - 0.6 in any of the four wise bands .",
    "the low resolution radio observations of @xcite and @xcite were the first to identify g213.0 - 0.6 as a likely snr .",
    "this was based on their conclusion that this object has non - thermal emission with a spectral index @xmath180.5 which is typical for shell remnants . from the newly compiled radio ( and new optical ) images presented here",
    "it is clear that no radio emission from this remnant extends around s284 though s284 is itself a strong radio source with a flat thermal spectrum .",
    "this observation is in contradiction with the earlier observations noted above which suffered from low resolution and may explain the difference .",
    "the flux estimates should be re - evaluated with further radio observations though it is anticipated that any flux correction will be small and that the observed radio spectral index will remain negative and still inside the acceptable values found for shell supernova remnants .",
    "table  2 presents the most prominent observed spectral line intensities for each slit position in terms of h@xmath0=100 , as well as the ratio of [ nii]/h@xmath0 , [ sii]/h@xmath0  and [ sii ]  6717/6731 .",
    "it is a commonly adopted diagnostic ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that an [ sii]/h@xmath0  ratio @xmath190.5 can separate snrs from planetary nebula and  regions . all snr spectra provide ratios well inside this criteria with [ sii]/h@xmath0   between 0.5 and @xmath11",
    ". the observed ratios of [ nii]/h@xmath0  is a little lower compared with many other optical snr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) but still acceptable , although this is somewhat dependent on the nitrogen abundance in the galaxy .",
    "is extremely strong in some snrs e.g. see @xcite . ] the large angular size and morphological structure likely indicate an old remnant and this is also supported by the observed ratio of the sulphur lines 6717/6731  which are generally in the low density limit of @xmath1  1.45 @xcite .",
    "the exception is for the spectrum from slit position a ) from december 17 , 2008 where we can estimate ne@xmath110@xmath20  @xmath21 . in young remnants this [ sii ]",
    "ratio goes well bellow 1 due to the higher electron densities present .",
    "confirmation that we have a case of an old supernova remnants comes from the fact that in some young remnants with relatively high velocities ( order of @xmath22200  kms@xmath16 ) balmer dominated shock(s ) can be noticed ( they are `` non - radiative '' ) without any [ sii ]  lines , what is certainly not the case here .    the point argued by @xcite and @xcite that g213.0 - 0.6 is most probably interacting with the adjacent , prominent  region s284 and therefore that the snr distance can likewise be estimated to be 2.4  kpc is not bourns out by this study .",
    "@xcite mentioned that this association follows from an apparent interaction which can be explained if we take into account their 14  arcminute radio telescope resolution . from the high resolution",
    "shs h@xmath0  imaging , comparison with the @xcite radio morphology image and our pmn @xmath15  arcmin resolution image from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and our new combined optical and radio colour image in fig.7 it is clear there is no obvious interaction .",
    "however , there is a clear match between the radio and optical morphology of the snr . although we do not know the precise spatial distribution of the radio ( or optical ) filaments , it is clear from the pmn image that on all sides ( except to the north where the blowout is present ) that the shell is effectively coherent , including to the north - west where s284 is situated .",
    "we might also suspect that the radio or optical shell would be fractured on the side toward s284 if any interaction exists ( which is not the case ) and that the low resolution of the previous radio observations would not show the fine detail we have seen from the pmn , nvss and high resolution shs observations .",
    "let us now consider the mid - infrared msx 8.3  @xmath6 m emission in the vicinity of g213.0 - 0.6 which is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "the msx data can reveal emission from molecular gas and emission from warm and cool dust grains .",
    "the 8.3  @xmath6 m band is one of six msx bands with a resolution of 18.3  arcsec ( see details in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . besides this thermal emission , the msx 8.3  @xmath6 m band is also sensitive to fluorescent emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( or pahs ) .",
    "@xcite compared images from msx and from radio continuum images from the 408  mhz from molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) and concluded that classical  regions are registered in both msx bands ( where pah fluorescence is found peripheral to the ionized gas ) and in the radio .",
    "however , no such association between msx at 8.3  @xmath6 m and the radio is seen in the area of non thermal emission such as for snrs .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows an absence 8.3  @xmath6 m emission , confirming again the non thermal nature of this remnant . as a caveat we note",
    "snrs can be very complex in their structure and emission components where both non thermal and thermal emission from ( neighbouring )  regions can be mixed .",
    "we also compared the radio and optical emission from g213 with mir data from the space - based wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) .",
    "wise bands 1 and 2 ( e.g. at 3.4 and 4.6  @xmath6 m ) did not show any nebular structure in this area that can be obviously correlated with g213.0 - 0.6 . in the longer wavelength wise bands 3 and 4 ( e.g. at 12 and 22  @xmath6 m ) a number of fragmented dust clouds in and over the radio / optical boundaries of g213.0 - 0.6 are seen ( see fig .",
    "[ wisepmn ] ) . despite this",
    "there does not appear to be any particular spatial association of the clouds detected in these wise bands with the observed radio / optical filamentary structure , neither could we find any match in their morphological forms . further , keeping in mind that for the majority of snrs any infrared emission originates at the interaction zone of a shock with the surrounding ism , we assume that the 22  @xmath6 m clouds seen in fig .",
    "[ wisepmn ] are connected with the  region s284 .",
    "we again conclude that there is no obvious connection of the  region and the snr and therefore that they may be at different distances .    as an example typical of many snrs , we consider snr g332.5 - 5.6 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where none of the four wise bands show any trace of a match with the radio data .",
    "as a counter example we also consider the case of snr g11.2 - 0.3 where there is an excellent match seen between the radio and wise emissions over the whole circular shell of this remnant .",
    "these examples simply shows that if infrared dust clouds from fig .",
    "[ wisepmn ] are in the surrounding regions ( e.g. at the same distance ) as snr g213.0 - 0.6 a strong morphological match would exist .",
    "additionally , support for non - interaction of these two objects is also clearly seen on fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] where they definitely appear as separate objects .    in conclusion ,",
    "all the currently available multi - wavelength evidence confirms the presence of an snr .",
    "this includes the negative radio spectral index typical for shell snrs and the matching h@xmath0  emission and filamentary structures which are also typical of optically detected snrs and which closely follow the outlines of the radio shell .",
    "the follow - up optical spectra also reveals the shock excitation expected of snrs .",
    "furthermore , the new high resolution optical imaging and relatively high resolution radio observations from the pmn survey at 4850  mhz and nvss at 1400  mhz all support the inference that the supernova explosion occurred at a position closer to g213.3 - 0.4 which corresponds to the geometric centre of the main body of the shell seen in h@xmath0  and of the x - ray source .",
    "this could not be accurately estimated from the previous low resolution radio observations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we therefore re - designate the snr g213.0 - 0.6 as g213.3 - 0.4 .",
    "finally , the  s284 region is shown to have no clear connection to the snr contrary to what has been previously implied and so we can not confidently use any distance determination to this  region to infer a physical size for the remnant .",
