    "in this paper , we use standard concepts and results about distance - regular graphs ( see , for example , biggs @xcite , or brouwer , cohen , and neumaier @xcite ) , spectral graph theory ( see cvetkovi , doob , and sachs @xcite , or godsil @xcite ) , and spectral and algebraic characterizations of distance - regular graphs ( see , for instance , fiol @xcite ) .",
    "edge - distance - regular graphs , introduced by fiol and garriga @xcite , are analogous to distance - regular graphs but considering the distance partitions induced by every edge instead of each vertex .",
    "thus , many known results for distance - regular graphs have their counterpart for edge - distance - regular graphs such as , for instance , the so - called spectral excess theorem .",
    "this theorem characterizes ( vertex- or edge-)distance - regular graphs by their spectra and the ( average ) number of vertices at extremal distance ( from every vertex or edge ) .",
    "see fiol and garriga @xcite and cmara , dalf , fbrega , fiol , and garriga @xcite for the cases of distance - regular and edge - distance - regular graphs , respectively .",
    "also , for short proofs , see van dam @xcite and fiol , gago , and garriga @xcite .",
    "a distance - regular graph @xmath0 with diameter @xmath1 and odd - girth ( that is , the shortest cycle of odd length ) @xmath2 is called a _ generalized odd graph _ , also known as an _ almost - bipartite distance - regular graph _ or a _ regular thin near @xmath3-gon_. the first name is due to the fact that odd graphs @xmath4 ( see biggs @xcite ) are distance - regular and have such an odd - girth . notice that , in this case , the intersection parameters of @xmath0 satisfy @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "recently , van dam and haemers @xcite showed that any connected regular graph with @xmath7 distinct eigenvalues and odd - girth @xmath2 is a generalized odd graph .",
    "moreover , lee and weng @xcite used a variation of the spectral excess theorem for nonregular graphs to show that , in fact , the regularity condition is not necessary , and van dam and fiol @xcite gave a more direct short proof of the same result .    here",
    ", we provide some ( combinatorial and algebraic ) proofs that , in fact , any edge - distance - regular graph @xmath0 is also distance - regular . moreover , if this is the case , @xmath0 is either bipartite or a generalized odd graph , and the relationship between the intersection numbers of the corresponding distance partitions , induced by a vertex and by an edge , is made explicit .",
    "thus , a distance - regular graph @xmath0 is edge - distance - regular if and only if @xmath0 is either bipartite or a generalized odd graph .",
    "in fact , the ` only if ' part is also a consequence of a result by martin @xcite , who proved that if a pair of vertices at distance @xmath8 is a completely regular code in a distance - regular graph @xmath0 with diameter @xmath1 , then either @xmath9 and @xmath0 has intersection numbers @xmath10 , or @xmath11 and @xmath0 is antipodal .    in the rest of this section , we recall some concepts , terminology , and results involved . throughout this paper , @xmath12 denotes a connected graph on @xmath13 vertices and @xmath14 edges , having adjacency matrix @xmath15 , and spectrum @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , and the superscripts @xmath18 stand for the multiplicities .",
    "the distance between two vertices @xmath19 is denoted by @xmath20 , so that the diameter of @xmath0 is @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , given @xmath22 , the set @xmath23 is called the _",
    "@xmath24-th subconstituent _ with respect to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath25 is a singleton , @xmath28 , we write @xmath29 for @xmath30 and set @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "eccentricity _ or _ covering radius _ of @xmath25 is @xmath33 , so that we have the partition @xmath34 .",
    "given any two vertices @xmath35 at distance @xmath36 of a graph @xmath0 , we consider the numbers of neighbors of @xmath37 at distance @xmath38 , @xmath24 , @xmath39 from @xmath40 , that is , @xmath41 and @xmath0 is distance - regular if these numbers only depend on @xmath24 . in this case",
    "we write @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 and say that these numbers are _",
    "well defined_. a useful characterization of distance - regularity is the existence of the so - called _ distance - polynomials _",
    "@xmath45 of @xmath0 satisfying @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the @xmath24-th distance matrix of @xmath0 , with entries @xmath48 if @xmath49 , and @xmath50 otherwise .",
    "recall also that , if @xmath0 is distance - regular , the intersection parameters @xmath51 , with @xmath52 , for @xmath53 , are the fourier coefficients of the polynomial @xmath54 in terms of the basis constituted by the distance - polynomials of @xmath0 with respect to the scalar product @xmath55 thus , with @xmath56 , we have the well - known relations @xmath57 in particular , when @xmath58 and @xmath59 , we have @xmath60 ( the degree of @xmath0 ) and @xmath61 .",
    "thus , @xmath62 and , hence , @xmath63 if and only if @xmath64 .",
    "in fact notice that , for a general graph , the condition @xmath65 for any two adjacent vertices @xmath19 is equivalent to say that @xmath66 is well defined and null .    in an edge - distance - regular graph @xmath12 with diameter @xmath1 ,",
    "every pair of adjacent vertices @xmath67 is a completely regular code .",
    "more precisely , the distance partition @xmath68 of @xmath69 induced by an edge @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the set of vertices at distance @xmath24 from @xmath72 and @xmath73 , is regular and with the same edge - intersection numbers for any edge .",
    "that is , the numbers @xmath74 do not depend neither on the edge @xmath75 nor on the vertex @xmath76 , but only on the distance @xmath24 , in which case we write them as @xmath77 for @xmath78 and say that they are well defined ( see cmara , dalf , fbrega , fiol and garriga @xcite for more details ) .",
    "in the next result we show that every edge - distance - regular graph is either bipartite distance - regular or a generalized odd graph .",
    "[ thm edr is dr ] let @xmath0 be a graph with diameter @xmath1 .",
    "then , the following statements are equivalent :    * @xmath0 is edge - distance - regular ; * @xmath0 is distance - regular , either bipartite or a generalized odd graph",
    ".    moreover , if this is the case and @xmath0 has intersection array @xmath79 @xmath80 and it is bipartite , then its edge - intersection array is @xmath81 whereas , if @xmath0 is a generalized odd graph , its edge - intersection array is @xmath82    as the complete graphs clearly satisfy the result , we can assume that @xmath83 . given two adjacent vertices @xmath40 and @xmath84 of @xmath0 , let us consider the intersection numbers @xmath85 , so that the vertex partition induced by the distances from @xmath40 and @xmath84 is shown in fig .",

    "now , assume that , for some @xmath150 , @xmath118 and @xmath151 are well defined with @xmath152 or , equivalently , @xmath153 .",
    "thus , in order to show that @xmath154 and @xmath66 exist , consider a shortest path @xmath155 of length @xmath156 , so that @xmath157",
    ". then , eq . ( [ desig3 ] ) gives @xmath158 now , suppose that @xmath159 is an arbitrary edge .",
    "if we assume that @xmath160 , there exists a vertex @xmath161 and eq .",
    "( [ desig5 ] ) gives @xmath162 which would be a contradiction .",

    "thus , the numbers @xmath165 , for @xmath95 , are also well defined ; and the same holds for @xmath166 when @xmath0 is nonbipartite .",
    "consequently , @xmath0 is as claimed .      as a consequence of the previous results ,",
    "we next prove that the edge - distance - regular graphs are , in fact , a particular case of the so - called ( 1-)homogeneous graphs introduced by nomura in @xcite . a graph @xmath0 is called _ homogeneous _ if for all nonnegative integers @xmath167 and pairs of edges @xmath75 , @xmath159 , @xmath168 where @xmath169 is defined as before . in other words , @xmath0 is homogeneous if the partition of fig .",

    "* lemma  5.3 ) , curtin and nomura showed that every bipartite or almost bipartite distance - regular graph is homogeneous .",
    "then , from theorem [ thm edr is dr ] we have :    every edge - distance - regular graph is homogeneous .",
    "however , the converse is not true .",
    "a counterexample is , for instance , the wells graph @xmath170 , which is the unique distance - regular graph on @xmath171 vertices and intersection array @xmath172 ( see brouwer , cohen and neumaier ( * ? ? ?",
