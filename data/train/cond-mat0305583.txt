    "the nature of the vortex lattice melting transition in 2d superconductors has been debated in the literature for many years @xcite .",
    "early proposals @xcite@xmath0@xcite , based on the similarity to the kosterlitz - thouless - halperin - nelson - young theory of melting in 2d solids@xcite , have led to the conclusion that the melting transition is continuous .",
    "a weak first order melting transition was predicted more recently , however , by several monte carlo simulations @xcite@xmath0@xcite using the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory .",
    "it has been shown recently @xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite that shear motions of bragg chains along the principal crystallographic axis of the vortex lattice cost a very small fraction of the sc condensation energy and are responsible for the low temperature vortex lattice melting .",
    "this intrinsic anisotropy of the vortex lattice with respect to shear stress can not be easily detected experimentally since the orientation of the principal axis with respect to the laboratory frame depends on the local pinning potential , which in real superconductors is usually produced by random distribution of pinning centers .",
    "indirect experimental detection of this hidden anisotropy may be achieved by means of the small angle neutron scattering ( sans ) technique , due to the 1d nature of the effective thermal fluctuations in the vortex liquid state just above the melting point ( see ref.@xcite ) . a direct detection of this anisotropy ( e.g. by means of sans )",
    "could be possible if vortex solid phases with long range positional order were stabilized against the random influence of pinning impurities .",
    "this can be achieved by exposing the sc sample to an artificial periodic pinning array and tuning the magnetic flux density to an integer multiple of the pinning centers density .",
    "as will be shown in this paper , under certain conditions the artificial periodic pinning potential can stabilize weakly pinned vortex solid phases with long range positional order , which may exhibit the shear stiffness anisotropy characterizing the ideal vortex lattice .",
    "vortex matter interacting with periodic pinning arrays is currently a subject of intense experimental @xcite@xmath1@xcite and theoretical @xcite@xmath1@xcite investigations .",
    "developments of nano - engineering techniques , such as e - beam lithography , make it possible to fabricate well defined periodic arrays of sub - micron antidotes , or magnetic dots , in sc films with low intrinsic pinning , enabling to study the effect of well controlled artificial pinning centers .",
    "these experiments have shown that under certain conditions the underlying artificial pinning centers can attract vortices very strongly , thus stabilizing vortex patterns with global translational symmetry against the randomize influence of the natural pinning centers .    from theoretical point of view",
    "the utilization of an external periodic pinning potential provides a convenient tool for testing different models of the vortex state by simplifying considerably the model calculations . at the same time , however , the interplay between the vortex - vortex interactions , which favor hexagonal vortex lattice symmetry , and the underlying periodic potential can lead to a variety of vortex configurations , depending on the pinning strength , in which vortices detach from pinning centers to form more closely packed vortex patterns .",
    "as the interaction with a periodic substrate stabilizes the vortex system versus thermal fluctuations , it generally increases the melting temperature .",
    "however , as we shall see in this paper , deviation from the ideal hexagonal symmetry due to pinning reduces the phase dependent interaction between vortex chains @xcite , making them less enduring under thermal fluctuations . in the weak pinning limit , where depinned floating state can occur , the corresponding phase diagram becomes rather complicated , due to the possibility of transitions between floating solid and pin solid phases @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study the influence of a periodic pinning substrate on the vortex state in 2d , extreme type ii superconductors , at perpendicular high magnetic fields .",
    "our approach is based on the previously developed theory of vortex lattice melting in pure superconductors ( @xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite ) , carried out within the framework of the gl theory in the lowest landau level ( lll ) approximation . specializing the calculation for a vortex system interacting with a square pinning array under the first matching magnetic field , we study in detail some key limiting regions of the vortex phase diagram , which enables us to determine its main qualitative features .",
    "we consider a 2d superconductor at high perpendicular magnetic field , interacting with a periodic substrate of pinning centers , located at @xmath2 . a phenomenological ginzburg - landau functional , with an order parameter @xmath3 ,",
    "is used to describe the superconducting ( sc ) part of the free energy , and a local periodic pinning potential @xcite : @xmath4 determines the interaction of the vortex state with pinning centers .",
    "we assume @xmath5 , so that the pinning energy is minimal if the vortex core positions , determined by @xmath6 , coincide with pinning centers .",
    "our main interest here is in the influence of the pinning potential on the vortex lattice melting process , so that the pinning energy @xmath7 is restricted to the range of the vortex lattice melting energy , which is much smaller than the sc condensation energy .",
    "since the latter is of the same magnitude as the cyclotron energy , it is justified to restrict the analysis to the lll of the corresponding sc order parameter , which can be therefore written as a linear combination of ground landau orbitals : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and the amplitudes @xmath11 in the mean field approximation are related to the ( spatial ) mean square sc order parameter , @xmath12 , through : @xmath13 . in our notations",
    "all space variables are measured in units of magnetic length .    in this model , due to the gaussian attenuation along the @xmath14-axis over a characteristic distance of the order of the magnetic length , the vortex cores ( located at the zeros of @xmath3 ) form a network of linear chains along the @xmath15-axis ,",
    "each of which is determined mainly by a superposition of two neighboring landau orbitals @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is therefore  equal to the inter - vortex distance within a chain , while @xmath17 is the inter - chain spacing in the @xmath14-direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that deviations of landau orbital ( lo ) amplitudes from their mean field value , @xmath18 , resulting in strong local distortions of the superfluid density and large increase of the corresponding free energy density , are neglected in comparison with variations of the phase variables , @xmath19 , provided the orbital direction is selected to be along the principal crystallographic axis @xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "we select the pinning centers to form a rectangular lattice @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 determine the relative position of the pin and vortex lattices .",
    "the nature of the vortex state in the presence of the pinning potential depends crucially on the ratio of the number of vortices , @xmath24 , to the number of pinning centers , @xmath25 .",
    "since the density of vortices depends on the external magnetic field strength @xmath26 , one can tune this ratio by varying @xmath26 .",
    "of special interest are the matching fields @xmath27 , @xmath28 , when the ratio @xmath29 is an integer .",
    "in matching fields one may distinguish between two different situations , when vortices are bound or unbound to pinning centers . if the pin lattice and the vortex lattice unit cells are commensurate along both @xmath15 and @xmath14 directions , i.e. @xmath30 , @xmath31 , with @xmath32 and @xmath33 being integers , the pinning energy is equal to zero , since all the vortices coincide with pinning centers . in all other cases of matching fields ,",

    "it should be stressed that this approximation is valid only for los along the principal axes since the minimal distance between them , @xmath10 , is sufficiently large to ensure small and rapidly decreasing value of the overlap integrals between more distant orbitals .",
    "if @xmath32 is not an integer , namely the rectangular pin lattice and vortex lattice are incommensurate in @xmath15-direction , then eq.([eq:3 ] ) shows that @xmath41 . in this case",

    "thus , the pinning energy for incommensurate lattices is a constant @xmath46 which does not depend on the mutual orientation of the vortex and the pin lattices . note that the system size in @xmath14 direction is @xmath47 , a relation connecting @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",

    ", this suppression leads to uncorrelated vortex chains , resulting in melting .  in the tps - fs transitions , where the the vortex - vortex coupling is relatively large , the suppression of the pinning energy results in mutually correlated vortex chains , which lose correlation with the underlying pinning lattice .",
    "an intermediate pin solid phase of a triangular form has been also found in the london model calculation reported by pogosov _",

    "the symmetry of vortex lattice is changed discontinuously to the square symmetry of the pin lattice .",
    "our proposed phase diagram , shown in fig.[fig : ph_diag ] , thus consists of 2 pin solid phases , a floating solid and a liquid phase , delimitted by 4 interphase boundary lines , which intersect at two nearby triple points .",
    "this result is similar to the phase diagram found by reichhardt _",
    "et al_. @xcite , using molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "however , the intermediate tps phase obtained in our calculation , is missing in reichhardt _",

    "we have found a pinned , commensurate solid phase in the strong pinning - low temperature part of the phase diagram , which melts into a vortex liquid at high temperatures , and transforms into a floating ( incommensurate ) solid at low temperatures .",
