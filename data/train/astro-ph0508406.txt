    "the discovery of unexpectedly rich populations of luminous x - ray sources in galactic globular clusters @xcite was a sharp challenge to theorists .",
    "efficient mechanisms for generating large numbers of mass - transferring binaries , dominated by a compact primary , were required to explain the observations .",
    "tidal capture scenarios involving two stars @xcite and/or exchange reactions involving three stars @xcite were rapidly developed .",
    "these processes are now believed to be the sources of the neutron star - dominated x - ray binaries in globular clusters .",
    "strong observational evidence in favor of these scenarios is the remarkable correlation between stellar encounter rate and number of x - ray sources in globular cluster cores @xcite .",
    "these two and three - body mechanisms also predict large populations @xcite of accreting white dwarf - main sequence star binaries  the cataclysmic variable ( cv ) stars .",
    "unfortunately only one globular cluster dwarf nova ( dn ) is easily resolved and studied from the ground : v101 in m5 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the large amplitude variations of many cvs @xcite suggest that hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations of globular clusters would easily locate dozens in the core of each cluster . with expected apparent magnitudes in the range 17 - 23 ,",
    "prototypical cvs like ss cyg and u gem should be trivial to find .",
    "it would clearly be of enormous benefit to cv science if dozens of these objects , all at the same distance and with the same parent metallicity , could be located .",
    "accurate luminosity functions , and bias - free period distributions and eruption frequencies could be derived to confront theoretical models .",
    "tidal capture cvs could be contrasted with those produced by ordinary binary evolution .",
    "systematic variations in outburst properties and orbital distributions might be uncovered .",
    "remarkably , only a handful of absolutely certain cvs in globular clusters are known today .",
    "these include a few dwarf novae seen in eruption ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , one classical nova @xcite , @xcite , and a few spectrographically confirmed , very blue faint stars ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , dozens of cv candidates have been identified in 47 tuc @xcite , @xcite , m80 @xcite and in ngc 6397 @xcite through deep chandra x - ray observatory and hst observations .",
    "unfortunately , large amounts of hst and chandra time are essential for follow - up studies , so unambiguous characterization of all candidates may take many years .",
    "thus any new , unambiguous cvs that can be found in archival data are well worth searching for .",
    "about half of all known field cvs @xcite are dwarf novae ( dn ) .",
    "most known dn reveal themselves through 2 - 5 magnitude outbursts every few weeks to months @xcite ; similar dn in clusters should be identifiable in multi - epoch images .",
    "since large archival hst datasets of globulars are available we have been systematically looking for erupting dwarf novae in the cores of all such clusters . here",
    "we report the results of an extensive and successful search of m80 .",
    "m80 is one of the densest globular clusters in the milky way , with a spectacular blue straggler sequence @xcite , a quiescent old nova @xcite , and 19 x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison of m80 with 47 tuc @xcite suggests that the encounter rate in m80 is about a factor of two lower ; roughly 50 cvs should exist in m80 as of order 100 are predicted in 47 tuc @xcite .    in section 2 we present the observational database , search strategy , and the photometry of variables .",
    "the erupting dn , non - eruptive cv candidates and their light curves are shown in section 3 .",
    "we discuss whether the candidates could be other kinds of variables in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we report simulations to test our completeness , and to place limits on the numbers of dn of various luminosities in m80 .",
    "we report on a remarkable sequence of very blue , centrally located objects in section 6 , and our attempts to match these with the m80 x - ray sources in section 7 .",
    "we briefly summarize our results in section 7 .",
    "the hubble space telescope has imaged m80 during 8 separate epochs from 1994 to 2000 .",
    "all epochs except the last included f336w frames , particularly useful in detecting blue objects .",
    "the pass - band of the f450w frames of the last epoch is close to the f439w passband of epochs 1 and 2 , so that essentially constant limiting magnitude is attained for our 8 epoch survey ( see section 5 ) .",
    "the dates of observation , pi of program and program number , filters used , number of frames and total exposure time in each filter are given in the observing log which is table 1 .",
    "the individual wfpc2 images were combined using the `` montage2 '' routine contained within the stand - alone daophot package .",
    "these frames were run through daophot s matching program `` daomaster '' to derive the subpixel frame - to - frame shifts and thereby register all images to the first image of the first epoch .",
    "these shifts were passed to montage2 , which produced a single , sky subtracted , high signal - to - noise image for each epoch and filter .",
    "hst was not perfectly aligned at all epochs in all filters .",
    "figure 1 is an overview of the fields of view of the 8 epochs , with four of the most interesting objects that we found ( section 3 ) indicated .",
    "the dwarf - nova candidates ( figure 2 ) were found by image differencing _ and _ by blinking rapidly through groups of the f336w frames to look for any subtle changes in the appearance of the stellar field .",
    "dwarf novae should rise from invisibility to easily detectable in the timeframe defined by the observations . brightening from previously empty regions of the sky",
    "is easily seen .    in order to detect extremely faint stars ,",
    "a master list of stars was derived using the technique of @xcite .",
    "this technique rejects the brigher pixels from a stack , giving emphasis to fainter pixels , and thus probing deeper .",
    "in addition , point spread functions were created for the f336w , f450w , f656n , and f675w ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) data and then provided to the allframe software @xcite for multi - image simultaneous psf fitting to derive positions and magnitudes for as many stars as possible .",
    "the photometry was then converted to the st magnitude system as described in @xcite .",
    "the resulting color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of m80 , the deepest ever produced , is shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "the two new dwarf nova candidates are evident , as are the two very blue stars first noted by @xcite . in addition",
    ", many more faint blue objects  about 50 in all  are now visible in this deeper cmd .",
    "some of these very blue objects are also indicated in the finder chart that is figure 5 , and discussed in sections 6 and 7 .",
    "to be recognized as a candidate , a variable had to be visible on all frames in at least one of the eight epochs , and to have varied by more than 1.0 magnitudes between its faintest and brightest state .",
    "this selection method revealed two dwarf nova candidates from the entire dataset ( and no other obvious variables ) .",
    "these two strongly varying , very blue candidates which we label dn1 and dn2 are erupting in epochs 3 and 6 , respectively .",
    "their positions are : for dn1 @xmath4 16:17:02.2 , @xmath5 -22:58:37.9 ; and for dn2 , @xmath416:16:59.8 , @xmath5 -22:58:18.0 .",
    "the nightly images of these two objects are shown in figures 6 and 7 , and their photometry is presented in figures 8 and 9 .",
    "we defer a discussion of these stars and their implications until after the next section , where we simulate expected dn images and light curves .",
    "we show the images and photometry of the likely quiescent old nova ( t sco 1860 a.d . ) in figures 10 and 11 , respectively .",
    "brightness fluctuations do not exceed a few tenths of a magnitude .",
    "the mean apparent f336w magnitude is 21.5 , corresponding to an absolute u - band magnitude of 6.5 , well within the range of old nova luminosities @xcite .",
    "finally , we show in figures 12 and 13 the images and lightcurve of the faint blue object noted by @xcite . located close to t sco in the m80 color - magnitude diagram",
    ", it too varies by at most a few tenths of a magnitude .",
    "whereas the t sco lightcurve shows several points in a given epoch , the faint blue object s lightcurve shows only one brightness value for each epoch .",
    "the object lies rather close to the hst planetary camera ( pc ) chip s edge , and photometry was performed on the individual - epoch , cr - rejected images to boost the signal - to - noise . while its brightness and color are very suggestive , this object remains a cv candidate , and not a confirmed cv , until it is eventually shown to erupt as a dn or found to have a spectrum consistent with cataclysmic classification .",
    "to estimate our detection completeness for erupting dwarf novae to various magnitude limits we carried out simulations of eruptions for two of the best known and characterized galactic dwarf novae : ss cyg , and u gem .",
    "( these objects have accurately determined parallaxes @xcite and , using their well tabulated apparent magnitudes @xcite , the absolute magnitudes are easily calculated .",
    "these two dwarf novae were chosen to represent , respectively , the most luminous and more typical values of absolute magnitudes seen for erupting and quiescent dn ) . to simulate ss cyg ,",
    "100 artificial psfs were placed in random positions across an m80 hst f336w image of a single epoch .",
    "for these 100 psfs , brightnesses were determined by picking 100 random points from the ss cyg american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) lightcurve stretching over 1000 days .",
    "these 100 artificial dwarf novae , ( now mimicking ss cyg at 100 random places in its lightcurve ) , were shifted to the apparent magnitudes they would have at the 10.3 kpc distance of m80 @xcite .",
    "this image was then blinked against an image ( at a different epoch ) with these same artificial psfs corresponding to ss cyg in quiescence .",
    "the same procedure was performed for u gem , using 100 randomly sampled brightnesses from 1000 days of the u gem lightcurve .",
    "typical images of these simulated dwarf novae , each at their maximum , intermediate and minimum brightness , are shown in figure 14 .",
    "our simulations show that , by comparing two randomly selected epochs , one detects an ss cygni - like dwarf nova @xmath6 of the time , while u gem is detected @xmath7 of the time .",
    "the detection probability is thus @xmath8 per epoch for ss cyg and @xmath9 for u gem . in each independent epoch",
    ", we therefore expect that the probability of _ not seeing _ a given ss cyg in eruption is @xmath10 , and the probability of not seeing a given u gem in eruption is @xmath11 .",
    "thus in eight independent epochs ( a more pessimistic case than our own 8 epochs , where 5 epochs are precisely at weekly intervals ) we might expect to not see ss cyg @xmath12 of the time , and we expect to miss u gem - like objects @xmath13 of the time .",
    "equivalently , we expect to see at least @xmath14 of ss cyg - like eruptions and at least @xmath15 of all u gem - like eruptions .",
    "comparison of the two erupting dn candidates shown in figures 6 and 7 with the m80-dn simulation images shown in figure 14 demonstrates that the brightness and variability behaviors of our candidates are consistent with those expected of moderately luminous erupting dwarf novae in m80 .",
    "all erupting dwarf novae achieve outburst u band absolute magnitudes @xmath16 , and the simulations of figure 15 show that we easily reached fainter than that limit in all epochs .",
    "the very blue outburst colors , outburst brightnesses , presence and blue colors in quiescence , our completeness of detection of stars at different magnitudes ( figure 15 ) , and strong concentration to the center of m80 all argue very strongly in favor of dn1 and dn2 being dwarf novae .",
    "however , in the absence of spectra or a second recorded outburst , one could always argue that one or both of these are variables of some other type , perhaps not even associated with m80 .    what are possible variables that might mimic m80 dn behavior ? amongst these are : chance superpositions of background supernovae or classical novae , gamma ray bursts ( grb ) , microlensing events or milky way variables along the line of sight to m80 .",
    "large area , multi - epoch surveys for faint variables ( e.g. @xcite ) show that the strong central concentration of our variables to the core of m80 ( and the moderately high galactic latitude of the cluster , @xmath17 ) is far too high for them to be field rr lyrae stars or supernovae .",
    "the brightness and very blue colors of the candidates rule out other types of galactic variables .",
    "rr lyrae and flare stars do nt match the observed brightness and/or blue colors of the two dn candidates .",
    "the rarity of grb ( about 1 over the entire sky per day ) and microlensing events , and the very blue colors of our variables almost certainly rules out these possibilities .",
    "but while the magnitudes and colors both during outburst and quiescence of our dn candidates argue strongly for that classification , an absolutely certain characterization will require challenging but important follow - up observations .",
    "these include    \\1 ) spectra near quiescence ( to demonstrate the presence of balmer emission lines ) .",
    "\\2 ) imagery every day or two for several months with hst to reveal repeated eruptions separated by weeks to months .",
    "\\3 ) several hours of hst time - resolved uv or optical photometry to reveal the orbital modulation characteristic of cvs .",
    "the size of our field of view was 1574 arcsec@xmath18 , extending out to 1.9 core radii from the cluster center .",
    "the average time between eruptions for 21 well studied galactic dn is 29 days @xcite .",
    "the length and depth of our observing run ( 5 epochs spaced 1 week apart , and three other random epochs ) taken by themselves suggest that most erupting ss cyg - like or u gem - like dwarf nova would have been detected .",
    "in fact , our simulations of ss cyg and especially of u gem ( in section 4 ) demonstrate that outburst frequency is the key parameter in determining whether a given dwarf nova will be detected .",
    "ss cyg is intrinsically more luminous in outburst than u gem , but both are straightforward to detect , in eruption , in our dataset .",
    "it is the relative infrequency of u gem outbursts that makes it three times less likely ( 22% ) to be detected than ss cyg - like outbursts .",
    "given these probabilities of detecting ss cyg and u gem - like dwarf nova eruptions in m80 , what limits can we place on the total populations of similar objects in the cluster ?",
    "since we have only seen 1 eruption of each of the m80 dn we do nt know their eruption frequency or maximum luminosity .",
    "either could be u gem - like or ss cyg - like .",
    "our conservative estimate is that there are @xmath19 ss cyg - like dn in m80 , and @xmath20 u gem - like dn in the cluster .",
    "the fact that we detected only two erupting dn , and that there are almost certainly fewer than @xmath21 dn in m80 , when ( the admittedly simple ) tidal capture model predicts an order of magnitude more cvs suggests that    \\i ) ss cyg and u gem - like cvs in m80 are @xmath22 fewer in number than theory predicts , and/or    \\ii ) most cvs are more like the rarely erupting wz sge , and much fainter than the prototypical dn ss cyg and u gem , and/or    \\iii ) globular cvs may be mostly magnetic @xciteand non - eruptive .    what is the true , average inter - outburst period for all dwarf novae ?",
    "unfortunately , the answer is unknown .",
    "cv catalogs are dominated by the easy - to - find , frequently outbursting dn .",
    "in addition , the distances to all but a dozen or so galactic dn are too uncertain to yield an accurate luminosity distribution .",
    "( we note that the canonical literature distance to the prototypical dn , ss cyg , was in error by a factor of two until hst parallaxes became available in 2000 ) . a warning that cv populations may be dominated by extremely faint and/or infrequently erupting dn is personified in the nearest known dn , wz sge .",
    "this object is a mere 43.5 pc away @xcite , @xcite with absolute visual magnitudes at minimum and maximum of 11.8 and 3.9 , and 12 month - long eruptions separated by about 25 years .",
    "our chances of detecting a wz sge - like outburst are two orders of magnitude smaller than the likelihood of detecting a u gem - like eruption ( again , because of the relative outburst frequency ) . there could easily be 100 wz sge stars in m80and our chances of detecting even one in our dataset would only be of order 20% .",
    "we conclude that : there are @xmath23 or fewer ss cyg - like , or 9 or fewer u gem - like dn in m80 .",
    "however , 100 wz sges could exist in the cluster . if most cvs are similar to wz sge ( often referred to as cv `` graveyard '' objects ) then the small number of detected m80 dn is naturally explained .",
    "the deep @xmath0 vs. @xmath24 cmd of figure 5 contains a remarkable sequence of 54 objects running parallel to the main sequence and between 0.3 and 1.4 magnitudes blueward of it .",
    "we have verified that these faint blue objects are not due to e.g. `` hot '' pixels by comparing their images on frames from different epochs with significant spatial offsets . while it is certainly possible that some of these objects blue colors are due to photometric errors , at least a dozen objects with @xmath25 are ( on visual inspection ) very blue and unblended .",
    "this is precisely the part of the cmd that would be occupied by cvs and non - interacting white dwarf - red dwarf binaries .",
    "if these 54 objects are , indeed cvs and/or wd - rd binaries then they must possess masses larger than main sequence stars of similar magnitude .",
    "equipartition of energy should then have concentrated these blue objects towards the cluster center .",
    "this , in fact , is an acid test that must be passed if we are to give credence to the suggestion of the blue m80 stars as a wd - rd binary sequence .",
    "figure 16 strongly suggests that these blue stars are more centrally concentrated than main sequence stars , at least at @xmath26 arcsec from the cluster center .",
    "the k - s test determines that the blue objects and main sequence stars of figure 16 do not share the same radial distribution with @xmath27 confidence .",
    "the blue stragglers and main sequence stars are even more dramatically separated in figure 16 . the k - s test states that the bs and ms stars are drawn from different radial distributions with @xmath28 likelihood .",
    "artificial star tests were performed to determine the the recovery rate for artificial stars placed randomly on the chip .",
    "figure 17 shows the fraction of stars recovered in 8 different annuli centered on the center of the cluster , for several different brightesses .",
    "these simulations show that we approach maximum completeness ( @xmath29 ) for the fainter blue stars with @xmath30 only when @xmath26 arcsec from the core of m80 .",
    "_ thus the apparent weak central concentration of the blue stars in the inner 8 arcsec is probably due to significant incompleteness of the sample of these very faint objects in the core of the cluster , rather than their physical absence . _",
    "the central concentration of blue stragglers in globular clusters is ubiquitous and well established for many clusters e.g. @xcite , and indicative of objects with measured masses 2 - 3 times the turnoff mass @xcite .",
    "we conclude from figure 16 that the blue sequence stars of figure 13 are intermediate in mass between the main sequence and blue straggler stars exactly as one expects for wd - rd binaries .",
    "we have compared the positions of our four objects of interest ( dn1 , dn2 , t sco and the shara - drissen object ) as well as the 54 faint , blue objects with the 19 x - ray sources noted by @xcite .",
    "the right ascension and declinations of our full sample of 58 cvs and cv candidates were offset in an iterative manner until we found the optimal minimum separation between the 19 x - ray sources and the cv candidates .",
    "the best overall match ( in the least - squares sense ) occurs with offsets of @xmath31 and @xmath32 applied to the cv candidates , with or without the two significant outliers cx10 and cx19 removed .",
    "the resulting source distributions are shown in figure 18 .",
    "the 19 x - ray source positions together with the adjusted positions of the closest faint blue stars are listed in table 2 .",
    "the nearly 5  offset between the 19 x - ray sources and the 58 cvs and cv candidates is much larger than the uncertainties in hst and chandra pointings .",
    "we also find no correlation between the 19 x - ray sources luminosities and the f336w brightnesses of the 19 `` matched '' faint blue stars in table 2 .",
    "we interpret this to mean that , while the two populations are centrally concentrated , many ( and probably most or all ) of the apparent matches of table 2 are spurious .",
    "deep hst far - uv observations of m80 are currently being scheduled , and these will be important for providing optical - uv counterparts to this cluster s x - ray sources .    finally , we have also checked the h@xmath33 luminosities of the 54 faint blue sources .",
    "an @xmath3 versus h@xmath34 color - magnitude diagram is shown in figure 19 . of the full sample of 54 blue objects ,",
    "51 had measurable h@xmath33 fluxes .",
    "none of these faint blue sources appear to have an h@xmath33 brightness more significant than that of the overall cluster population .",
    "if these are degenerate star  red dwarf binaries then their mass transfer rates are very low or zero .",
    "we have observed m80 during 8 separate epochs with sufficient resolution and sensitivity to detect any erupting dwarf novae within the inner 1.9 core radii of that cluster .",
    "two very strong candidates , with outburst colors , brightnesses , central concentration , and presence in quiescence , all consistent with dn classification , were detected .",
    "the old nova candidate t sco ( nova 1860 ) and another very blue , faint star @xcite are remarkably constant in brightness . simulations and completeness tests indicate that @xmath35 regularly outbursting dwarf novae similar to ss cyg , and @xmath36 u gem - like dwarf novae exist today in m80 .",
    "the presence of several dozen very faint blue , centrally concentrated stars in the core of m80 hints at a large red dwarf  degenerate star binary population ; some of these may be a very rarely - erupting cv population .",

    "<S> we have searched all archival hst images of the dense globular cluster m80 for erupting dwarf novae ( dn ) , and to check the outburst behaviors of two very blue objects first identified a decade ago . </S>",
    "<S> two new erupting dwarf novae were found in 8 searched epochs , making m80 a record holder for erupting dn . </S>",
    "<S> the quiescent classical nova in m80 varies by no more than a few tenths of a magnitude on timescales of minutes to years , and a similar faint , blue object varies by a similar amount . </S>",
    "<S> simulations and completeness tests indicate that there are at most 3 erupting dn like ss cyg and at most 9 u gem - like dn in m80 . </S>",
    "<S> either this very dense cluster contains about an order of magnitude fewer cvs than theory predicts , or most m80 cvs are extremely faint and/or erupt very infrequently like wz sge . </S>",
    "<S> we have detected a sequence of 54 objects running parallel to the main sequence and several tenths of a magnitude bluewards of it . </S>",
    "<S> these blue objects are significantly more centrally concentrated than the main sequence stars , but not as centrally concentrated as the blue stragglers . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that these objects are white dwarf  red dwarf binaries , and that some are the faint cv population of m80 . </S>"
