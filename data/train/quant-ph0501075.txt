    "an unknown quantum state is destroyed at a sending place ( alice ) while a perfect replica appears at a remote place ( bob ) via the combined action of a quantum and a classical channels @xcite .",
    "teleportation has been demonstrated for the polarization state of a photon @xcite , the state of a trapped ion @xcite and , in the continuous variable regime , for the set of coherent states of a single - mode radiation field @xcite .",
    "perfect quantum teleportation requires a maximally entangled state as quantum channel .",
    "nevertheless , the protocol also works for nonmaximally or even mixed quantum channel @xcite , with fidelity of quantum teleportation still being better than any classical communication procedure .    initially , attention was mostly focused to teleportation of single - system quantum states , either of finite - dimensional n - level systems @xcite , or of single - mode continuous variables systems @xcite .",
    "more recently , attention has been devoted to teleportation of states of multipartite ( possibly entangled ) systems .",
    "notice that the sufficient and necessary conditions to induce entanglement on two remote qubits , by means of their respective linear interactions with a two - mode driving field , has been recently investigated @xcite .",
    "direct transmission of an entangled state was considered in a noisy environment @xcite , and the possibility to copy pure entangled states was studied @xcite",
    ". a straightforward generalization of single - body teleportation @xcite , shows that any state of a @xmath0-partite system can be teleported using @xmath0 maximally - entangled pairs as quantum channel and the transmission of classical information .",
    "in addition conclusive teleportation in @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space for partially entangled quantum channel has been formulated @xcite . moreover",
    "a scheme to teleport two - particle entangled states has been proposed , using three - particle entangled states , either of ghz- @xcite or w - type @xcite , as quantum channel .",
    "these schemes can be also generalized to teleport an unknown three - particle entangled state from a sender to any one of @xmath0 receivers .    in this paper",
    ", we focus our attention to teleportation schemes for bipartite ( entangled ) states of two qubits .",
    "our goal is to weaken the requirements for the quantum channel , _",
    "i.e. _ to devise teleportation protocols that work with a reduced amount of entanglement shared between the two parties .",
    "as we will see , there is a whole class of protocols realizing this task . in our schemes ,",
    "an unknown bipartite state can be perfectly teleported , sharing a single epr pair , once one has at disposal the following ingredients : i ) a two - qubit bell measurements ; ii ) an hadamard transformation and a single - qubit measurement at the sender s side ; iii ) an additional qubit and a set of two - qubit unitary transformations at the receiver s location .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ s : cnot ]",
    "the simplest example of our class of teleportation protocols is described in details , whereas the general scheme is addressed in section [ s : uf ] . in section [",
    "s : noise ] we analyze how our protocols work with noisy quantum channels , and evaluate teleportation fidelity as well as entanglement of the teleported state . section [ s : outro ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "let us consider the following situation .",
    "alice has at her side an unknown bipartite entangled state of the form @xmath2 and she wants to teleport this state to bob .",
    "we assume that alice and bob only share a single epr pair ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) @xmath3 , @xmath4 chosen accordingly to the information received from alice . in this way the initial state of qubits 34 is restored on qubits 25 .    , @xmath4 according to alice results . in this way the initial state of qubits 3 and 4 is restored on qubits 2 and 5.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the initial state of the system is given by @xmath5 but , for the moment , let us consider only the first four qubits , which are excited in the state @xmath6 and @xmath7 , described by the projectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 , with @xmath10 according to her results , there are four possible conditional states of qubits @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which are given by @xmath13 the correspondence between the index @xmath14 and the result of the bm is summarized in table [ tab1 ]",
    ".    @xmath15 + @xmath15 +    .summary of the eight possible combinations of alice s bell ( bm ) and qubit 4 ( z@xmath16 ) results , with the corresponding conditional states of qubits @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and conditional transformations ( ct ) performed by bob to restore the initial state at his location .",
    "[ tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     let us now take into account also qubit @xmath17 at bob s location , and assume it is prepared in the state @xmath18 .",
    "at this point , the global conditional state of the three qubits is given by @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that bob performs a c - not transformation , denoted by the unitary @xmath21 , on subsystems @xmath11 and @xmath17 , whereas alice rotates her qubit @xmath12 by a hadamard transformation .",
    "the output states resulting from this procedure are given by @xmath22 where the subscript in @xmath23 has the same meaning that in eqs .",
    "( [ chi1 ] ) and ( [ chi2 ] ) .",
    "now alice measures the qubit @xmath12 and sends the results to bob , together with the result of the bm .",
    "the global amount of classical information from alice to bob is thus three bits . indeed , according to the results of the bm and of the measurement of the qubit @xmath12 , there are @xmath24 possible conditional states at bob s site . in order to restore the original state , bob should perform an appropriate unitary transformation @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "it is straightforward to demonstrate that the @xmath25 are the factorized transformations given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we have thus demonstrated that teleportation of bipartite states of the form ( [ bipartite ] ) is possible using a single epr pair shared between alice and bob as far as an additional qubit and a c - not transformation are available at the receiver s location .",
    "three bits of classical information should be sent from alice to bob in order to restore the input state .",
    "notice that the choice of expression ( [ bipartite ] ) for the state to be teleported does not imply loss of generality .",
    "in fact , any linear combination of the form @xmath27 with @xmath28 can be brought to ( [ bipartite ] ) by a unitary transformation at the sender side and then it can be teleported by the same protocol .",
    "also the choice of the state for the qubit @xmath17 at bob s location is arbitrary .",
    "in fact , any initial preparation @xmath29 of qubit @xmath17 can be seen as the action of a given unitary on the state @xmath18 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath30 . in this case",
    "teleportation can be restored if bob performs the transformation @xmath31 instead of the c - not .",
    "this degree of freedom will be exploited in the next section , where a whole class of teleportation protocols will be introduced and characterized .",
    "finally , we mention that teleportation works equally well using a different bell state , either @xmath32 or @xmath33 , as quantum channel .",
    "let us consider a teleportation scheme similar to that of section [ s : cnot ] where , instead of a c - not , bob is only able to perform a given generic two - qubit transformation @xmath34 on qubits @xmath11 and @xmath17 ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the purpose of this section is twofold . on one hand , we show that teleportation can be still achieved by",
    "_ factorized _ conditional transformations at bob site as far as @xmath34 ia a nonzero entangling transformation . on the other hand , we show that indeed there exists a class of transformations assuring the success of the protocol , corresponding to a su@xmath35 symmetry of the set of transformations itself .",
    "we denote the action of @xmath34 on the standard basis by @xmath36 . following the protocol of section [ s : cnot ] , with @xmath34 instead of the c - not",
    ", we have that after the bm and the measurement of qubit @xmath12 , the eight possible conditional states of qubits @xmath11 and @xmath17 are given by @xmath37     and then the unitary transformation @xmath38 , @xmath4 according to alice results .",
    "the initial state of qubits 34 is restored on qubits 25 as far as @xmath34 has nonzero entangling power.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    teleportation is possible if we find the appropriate unitaries @xmath38 to restore the initial state .",
    "the seeked transformations should fulfill the following requirements @xmath39 notice that these relations only determine two lines ( the first and the fourth ) of the @xmath40 matrix representation of each @xmath38 .",
    "( [ defa]-[deff ] ) thus imply @xmath41 where @xmath42 means equality _ only _ on the relevant lines .",
    "explicitly , eqs.([defa]-[deff ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath43 where @xmath44 are complex parameters and where , from top left to bottom right @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively , now , imposing the condition of ( special ) unitarity to matrices in eq .",
    "( [ 4mat ] ) , we obtain the following expression for the second and third line of each product @xmath49 @xmath50 the initial @xmath24 complex parameter @xmath44 are thus reduced to the three real phases @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , corresponding to a su@xmath35 symmetry of the set @xmath38 .",
    "once the transformation @xmath34 is known , eqs .",
    "( [ 4mat ] ) and ( [ tre ] ) fully determine the form the transformations @xmath38 , each of them being determined in a class with three real parameters .",
    "this degree of freedom can be used to reduce the number of conditional transformations needed to reconstruct the state nearby bob , and to realize them as factorized operations on the two qubits .",
    "for example , we can choose @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , as it was implicitly assumed in section [ s : cnot ] .",
    "notice that factorized @xmath38 , as it was in the scheme of section [ s : cnot ] , can be obtained iff @xmath34 have a nonzero entangling power _",
    "i.e. _ full rank , otherwise eqs .",
    "( [ 4mat ] ) can not be inverted , and no set of unitaries @xmath38 exists to restore the initial state at bob site . on the other hand , if we accept that the @xmath38 s may be genuine two - qubit transformations , then ( [ 4mat ] ) have solutions for a generic @xmath34 . in this case , however , the role of @xmath34 is irrelevant , and it can be included in a redefinition of the @xmath38 s .",
    "using the protocols described in the previous sections , with a single pure maximally entangled state as quantum channel , perfect teleportation of bipartite states ( [ bipartite ] ) may be achieved .",
    "however , entanglement can be in general corrupted by the interaction with the environment . therefore ,",
    "entangled states that are available for experiments are usually mixed states , and it becomes crucial to establish whether or not the nonlocal character of the protocols has survived the environmental noise .",
    "teleportation is a linear operation , which also work with mixed states . for a single qubit , quantum teleportation with a mixed quantum channel",
    "was studied and it was shown that also when the channel is not maximally entangled the fidelity is better than any classical communication procedure @xcite .    in this section",
    "we study the effect of noise on our schemes , and analyze to which extent the teleportation of bipartite states is degraded .",
    "both fidelity of teleportation and entanglement of the replica will be evaluated . as noisy quantum channel ( qubits 1 and 2 ) we consider a werner state of the form @xmath58 the same results are obtained using a werner state built from a different bell state , either @xmath59 or @xmath60 . as measure of entanglement for the bipartite state @xmath61 we consider its `` negativity '' @xmath62 _ i.e. _ the ( double ) sum of the negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose @xmath63 . with this definition the quantum channel ( [ werner ] ) shows a nonzero degree of entanglement iff @xmath64 .",
    "we have @xmath65 from which we also obtain @xmath66 . for the state @xmath67 of eq .",
    "( [ bipartite ] ) , _ i.e. _ the state to be teleported , the negativity is given by @xmath68 notice that in this case we have @xmath69 i.e. the same degree of entanglement is obtained for two different values of @xmath70 symmetric with respect to @xmath71 . using the mixed state ( [ werner ] ) as quantum channel our teleportation schemes lead to the following output teleported state for qubits 2 and 5 @xmath72 , which is given by @xmath73 and in terms of the entanglement parameters @xmath74 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the fidelity as a function of the initial entanglement @xmath75 for different values of the channel entanglement @xmath76 .",
    "notice that for each value of @xmath76 fidelity shows two branches , corresponding to the two different values of @xmath70 that give the same @xmath75 . by increasing the entanglement of the channel",
    "the two branches approach each other , and for @xmath77 we have @xmath78 for any value of @xmath75 . the average fidelity over all possible input states , _ i.e. _ over all possible values of @xmath79 is given by @xmath80     for different values of the channel entanglement @xmath76 .",

    "to bottom the curves are plotted for @xmath82 , scaledwidth=35.0% ]    in order to evaluate the entanglement of the teleported state @xmath83 we calculated the eigenvalues of the partial transpose .",
