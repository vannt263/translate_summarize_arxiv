    "although the theory of scaling and renormalization has profoundly affected our conceptual understanding of many - body systems , its calculational framework is imperfect and continually evolving . in the end , we are interested in how couplings flow under changes of scale , but a variety of distinct procedures exist , each with its own advantages and drawbacks .",
    "an incomplete list of the assortment of programs includes the multiplicative rg , real space decimation , functional rg , exact rg , flow equations , and various flavors of @xmath3-expansion , such as the classic minimal subtraction which expands around @xmath4 , or expansions around some other parameter , such as the deviation of the range of the interaction from a suitable reference value .",
    "each method has its own limits of practicality , ease of use , and range of problems to which it may be usefully employed .",
    "wilson s momentum - shell approach  @xcite is an especially popular method in the context of condensed matter problems .",
    "however , in the early 1990 s a few people recognized  @xcite that the standard momentum - shell procedure must be modified for problems involving a fermi surface .",
    "a campaign soon followed attempting to understand fermi liquid theory from an rg perspective .",
    "an excellent and influential summary of the pure fermion rg can be found in  @xcite .",
    "another indication that the rg for fermions required more scrutiny came from the study of quantum criticality in itinerant electron magnets . the usual hertzian approach  @xcite uses an auxiliary ( hubbard - stratonovich ) field to decouple the fermion - fermion interaction , thus allowing fermions to be completely integrated out .",
    "the resulting effective theory is then expressed in terms of the remaining bosonic auxiliary field , to which standard bosonic rg techniques can be employed . however , because the fermions are gapless , the process of integrating them out may introduce non - analyticities in the couplings among the remaining bosonic modes  @xcite .",
    "it would therefore be important to devise an rg scheme capable of simultaneously handling both bosons and fermions with a fermi surface .",
    "besides the critical itinerant magnets , a mixed fermionic - bosonic rg formalism would be quite useful for an assortment of problems .",
    "for example , in the context of a gauge field coupled to fermions , several authors  @xcite have developed their own rg schemes for counting dimensions in these mixed theories .",
    "all have in common the subdivision of the fermi surface into a large number of patches , but results vary and despite the intervening 15 years since this pioneering work , little progress has been made . the importance of the gauge - fermion problem is historically linked to an interesting path to non - fermi liquid behavior @xcite .",
    "more recently , effective gauge theories have appeared in a number of additional contexts in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "we should mention in passing a growing body of work on the functional rg which may be adapted for mixed boson - fermion theories  @xcite .",
    "this typically requires blending with computational methods and may prove to be a useful framework for understanding realistic material bandstructures .",
    "our aim here is rather more modest , which is to develop an rg scheme for mixed theories with a high score in the `` ease of use '' category .",
    "this was the chief virtue of the original wilsonian rg which could quickly identify the relevant and irrelevant operators with minimal effort .",
    "one emphasis of this paper will be to carefully consider how to extend shankar s scheme @xcite to include bosons while maintaining the easy - to - use spirit of the wilsonian approach .    our primary motivation to consider these issues came from the context of magnetically ordered phases of some itinerant systems .",
    "in the case of an antiferromagnetic state of a kondo lattice , the bosonic magnons , described by a quantum non - linear sigma model , are coupled to the fermionic quasiparticles near a fermi surface . in this problem ,",
    "energy and momentum scale the same way ; the dynamic exponent @xmath5 .",
    "the ferromagnetic counterpart features @xmath6 .",
    "the rg analysis plays an essential role in understanding the fermi surfaces in these systems and has been briefly described in our earlier works  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to explain the details of the method in considerable detail with the hope that the method will be adapted to problems in new physical contexts .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : bosons ] we remind the reader of the essential points of the bosonic wilson - hertz scaling .",
    "section  [ sec : fermions ] quickly moves on to discuss scaling in fermionic systems , largely paraphrasing what has already been done but emphasizing a slightly different perspective .",
    "the next section , [ sec : bosons+fermions ] , describes a method to properly scale in mixed theories when energy and momentum can be given the same scaling dimension , _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath5 .",
    "this is closest in spirit to the shankar approach , but can not be generalized to @xmath2 .",
    "some of these problems are discussed in sections [ sec : choiceofscheme ] and [ sec : patching ] . in section [ sec : patching ] we present an alternative method for arbitrary @xmath7 that is perhaps less intuitive than that of section [ sec : bosons+fermions ] , but has the advantage of being generalizable to @xmath2 while at the same time yielding identical results when @xmath5 .",
    "the problem we are concerned with can be decomposed into bosonic , fermionic , and interaction terms : @xmath8 the bosonic and fermionic pieces can be further divided into quadratic and quartic pieces .",
    "@xmath9 theories based upon @xmath10 or @xmath11 alone have already been subjected to momentum - shell rg analyses ; see , for example , @xcite and @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we review the wilson - hertz scaling procedure for bosons , so we are only concerned with @xmath10 .    in the most general case",
    ", the quadratic part of the action can take several different forms depending on the value of @xmath7 .",
    "for example , @xmath12 the bosons might represent acoustic phonons , magnons , photons , or some collective mode of an underlying fermionic theory that results after `` integrating out '' the fermions with an auxiliary field . at this point , we need not be specific .",
    "all that matters is that we must design the rg scheme in such a way that @xmath13 remains invariant .",
    "the wilsonian rg for bosons is well - known",
    "@xcite so we only review those elements crucial to the comparisons we wish to make later with the fermionic rg .",
    "consider a @xmath14-dimensional integral in momentum space with a cutoff to high - energy and therefore large-@xmath15 modes ; this is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "let us separate out a thin shell of high energy modes in the range @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",

    "we have ignored factors of @xmath23 .",
    "mode elimination amounts to simply throwing away the shell integral . to regain the original form of the action only a trivial rescaling of the radial coordinate is needed : @xmath24 this defines the scaling dimension of momentum . in the customary notation , we use square brackets to denote the scaling dimension of any quantity according to @xmath25 } a \\label{eq : bracketnotation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is measured in units @xmath27 } $ ] times smaller than the units of @xmath28 .",

    "this notation differs from another frequent convention which may claim , for instance , @xmath30 = l^3 $ ] where @xmath31 is some length scale .",
    "we prefer our notation since it means a coupling g is relevant when @xmath32>0 $ ] , irrelevant when @xmath32<0 $ ] , and marginal when @xmath32=0 $ ] .    in this notation ,",
    "an equivalent statement to equation @xmath33 is simply @xmath34 & = & 1 \\label{eq : qdim}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using this form of momentum scaling in the integral leads to @xmath35 we conclude that the scaling dimension of the measure is given by @xmath36 & = & d[q ] = d \\label{eq : bosonmeasure}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that rescaling the radial variable , @xmath15 , is the same as rescaling all the components of @xmath22 since @xmath37 .",
    "for this to be consistent with @xmath38 , we must have @xmath39 for all components @xmath40 .",
    "this is an important difference from the fermionic case to be discussed later and results from the simple fact that the coordinate origin here is a single point rather than an extended surface .",
    "let us apply this mode elimination and rescaling to the quadratic part of the boson action , taking the case @xmath6 as an example .",

    "we wish to scale the terms in the parentheses identically , so we must have @xmath43 = -[\\omega]+[q]$ ] thus fixing the relationship between the scaling dimensions of energy and momentum : @xmath34 & = & \\left [ \\omega \\right ] / z \\label{eq : bosonwqz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where our example considered @xmath6 explicitly .",
    "the final step is wavefunction renormalization which can be implemented by defining a new field @xmath44 according to : @xmath45+[\\omega ] \\ } /2 }",
    "\\phi(s^{-[q ] } q^{\\prime } , s^{-[\\omega ] } i \\omega^{\\prime } ) \\label{eq : bosonscaling}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equivalently , we might say that the boson field has a scaling dimension given by @xmath46 = -\\frac{[q]}{2}(d+z+2 ) \\label{eq : phidim}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used @xmath47 = z[q]$ ] .",
    "although customary , equation ( [ eq : phidim ] ) is slightly misleading .",
    "the replacement of @xmath48 by @xmath49}\\phi^{\\prime}$ ] in analyzing interaction terms should only be done when the arguments of the field transform according to equation ( [ eq : bosonscaling ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : s3k1k2rep ] ) provides an example where the arguments of the field are transformed in a very different fashion . from equation ( [ eq : bosonscaling ] )",
    "we see that the boson field appears to take the form of a generalized homogeneous function .",
    "we do not delve into this issue further , but merely note that equation ( [ eq : bosonscaling ] ) is a very specific type of substitution that needs to be implemented in this strict form .",

    "now that we know how to scale momentum from equation ( [ eq : qdim ] ) , energy from equation ( [ eq : bosonwqz ] ) , and the field from equation ( [ eq : bosonscaling ] ) , we are ready to analyze the four - boson interaction term : @xmath54 the @xmath55-functions enforce the conservation of energy and momentum while the @xmath56-functions define the cutoffs for the effective field theory ( in principle , energy cutoffs should also be written , but this is understood ) .    to determine the scaling dimension of @xmath57 at the tree level , we first separate the integrations into low and high energy modes [ _ i.e. _ @xmath58 , then discard the high energy shell .",
    "there is some freedom in choosing the shape of the shell which can take some curious forms for the purpose of simplifying calculations .",
    "see the discussion by hertz  @xcite .",
    "after rescaling according to ( [ eq : qdim ] ) , ( [ eq : bosonwqz ] ) , and ( [ eq : phidim ] ) , we find @xmath59 which tells us that @xmath60 , or equivalently @xmath61 & = & 4-(d+z)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this yields a quick way to determine when the four - boson interaction term @xmath62 is relevant or irrelevant based on the dimensionality of the problem and the value of @xmath7 .",
    "historically , this result provided some early intuition about quantum phase transitions which can behave like classical phase transitions but in a different number of effective dimensions : @xmath63 .",
    "although the theory was originally devised to address questions about itinerant quantum critical magnets  @xcite , some problems have been encountered with this approach  @xcite .",
    "part of the problem could be that the theory is completely bosonic , despite the underlying fermionic nature of the system .",
    "it is therefore desirable to develop an rg formalism that includes fermions with a fermi surface .",
    "for fermions , the quadratic part of the action is given by @xmath64 to define a scaling scheme that leaves @xmath65 scale invariant , we now review the formulation of the fermionic rg  @xcite .",
    "we shall use shankar s notation and label momenta measured with respect to the brillouin zone center with a capital letter @xmath66 .",
    "in contrast to the bosonic case , low energy modes live near an extended surface ( the fermi surface ) rather than a single point ( the brillouin zone center ) . for a spherical fermi surface , a high energy cutoff can be implemented on @xmath67-integrals as follows : @xmath68 where @xmath16 is an ultraviolet cutoff , but we still insist @xmath69 . here , @xmath70 represents the measure for integration over all angular coordinates in @xmath67-space , while @xmath71 is the radial coordinate .",
    "usually , we work at fixed fermion density which , by luttinger s theorem , dictates that we design our scaling scheme in such a way that the fermi volume remains invariant . to preserve the fermi surface under rescaling",
    "we can not simply scale the radial coordinate as we did in the bosonic case . to see this , observe that after mode elimination the expression we wish to rescale is given by @xmath72 clearly , no simple rescaling of @xmath73 will return the integral to its original form .",
    "this is the principle disparity between the fermionic and bosonic rg . to make progress we define the lower case letter @xmath74",
    "note that @xmath75 corresponds to @xmath76 since @xmath77 .",
    "small @xmath78 corresponds to low energy whereas small @xmath73 does not .",
    "such a change of variables greatly facilitates rescaling .",
    "@xmath79 we have neglected certain terms above for two reasons : they are of order @xmath80 relative to what has been kept , and they are less relevant in the rg sense . to see the latter , note that the integral can be restored to its original form with the simple rescaling @xmath81 .",
    "this determines the scaling dimension @xmath82 & = & 1 \\label{eq : scalingk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the variable @xmath78 is not a vector , nor is it a radial coordinate since it can take negative values .",
    "later , we will discuss another scheme , which we call `` patching , '' that decomposes the momenta into components parallel ( @xmath83 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath84 ) to the fermi surface normal . to make later contrast with the patching scheme of section  [ sec : patching ] , which uses local coordinates for each patch",
    ", we will call the present approach the `` global coordinate '' scheme .    to further emphasize the dissimilarity between the fermionic and bosonic cases , observe that after the rescaling of equation ( [ eq : scalingk ] ) , @xmath85 which implies that , effectively , @xmath86 & = & 1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this stands in sharp contrast to the bosonic case in equation ( [ eq : bosonmeasure ] ) . here , the angular variables are truly untouched after rescaling which is necessary to maintain the fermi surface",
    ". unfortunately , the straightforward transformation @xmath87 does not translate into a simple transformation on the components of @xmath67 .",
    "care must therefore be exercised to write all expressions in terms of @xmath78 before the scaling procedure can begin .",
    "for example , after mode elimination and rescaling of energy and momentum , the quadratic part of the fermionic action is given by : @xmath88 } i\\epsilon^{\\prime } - v_f s^{-[k ] } k^{\\prime}\\big ]      \\psi(k_f + s^{-1}k^{\\prime},s^{-1}i\\epsilon^{\\prime } ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we wish to scale both of the terms inside the square brackets identically , we must choose @xmath89 & = & \\left [ \\epsilon \\right ] \\label{eq : kesame}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus fixing the relationship between the scaling dimensions of energy and momentum .",
    "for convenience we can set this value equal to 1 , as in equation ( [ eq : scalingk ] ) .",
    "compare this to equation ( [ eq : bosonwqz ] ) .    in order to make @xmath65 invariant to the rg transformation",
    "we must demand that the fermion field obeys : @xmath90 where we have not explicitly written the dependence of @xmath91 on angular variables since these do not scale . equation ( [ eq : fermionscaling ] )",
    "tells us two important things .",
    "first , the dimension of the fermion field is simply : @xmath92 & = & -3/2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] second , the rg transformation of the fermion field does _ not _ take the form of a generalized homogeneous function as was the case for the bosonic field ; see equation ( [ eq : bosonscaling ] ) .",
    "the momentum argument of the fermion field @xmath67 has a magnitude equal to the fermi wavevector plus a small deviation : @xmath93",
    ". only the deviation @xmath78 scales , while @xmath94 remains constant .",
    "this important difference from the bosonic case will be discussed further in section  [ sec : choiceofscheme ] .",
    "the story so far seems relatively elementary , but the true subtleties materialize when we try to determine the dimension of the @xmath95 coupling function @xmath96 based on the dimension assignments required to make @xmath65 scale invariant .",
    "the quartic part of the action can be written  @xcite @xmath97 the @xmath55-functions explicitly enforce the conservation of energy and momentum ( up to a reciprocal lattice vector ) .",
    "we might integrate one of the energies and momenta , say @xmath98 , against the delta function to yield an integral over three independent sets @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 . @xmath102 but this expression is not quite right .",
    "the problem is that not all momentum - conserving processes should be included in the low - energy effective field theory .",
    "we must respect the cutoff imposed on the quadratic part of the action , which only allows excursion into states within a distance @xmath103 of the fermi surface . imposing a cutoff",
    "amounts to constraining the momentum integrals . until now",
    ", we have implemented the cutoff constraints by writing them explicitly in the limits of integration , but let us re - express them as @xmath104 where , as usual , @xmath105 . with all momentum integrals written in this way , we can safely use the @xmath55-functions to eliminate one variable , say @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "@xmath108 the constraints on @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 have been put back in the limits of integration , but we have the additional constraint @xmath112 where @xmath113 once we have conserved momentum , @xmath106 is no longer an independent variable , so we use the notation @xmath114 to represent the combination of variables specified in equation ( [ eq : kfour ] ) .",
    "we can implement the constraint embodied in @xmath115 in a number of ways .",
    "one way is to allow @xmath109 and @xmath110 to range anywhere inside the annuli defined by @xmath116 , but restrict @xmath111 as appropriate to satisfy @xmath112 .",
    "the outcome of a proper phase space analysis shows that once @xmath109 and @xmath110 have been chosen , the angle for @xmath111 is highly constrained  @xcite .    to see this in more detail ,",
    "observe that to leading order in @xmath80 , @xmath117 where @xmath118 , and where the @xmath119 are unit vectors , each pointing in the direction of @xmath120 .",
    "note that @xmath121 is not itself a unit vector since @xmath122^{1/2 } \\label{eq : moddelta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a result we will use in section  [ sec : choiceofscheme ] . after mode elimination , the momentum integrals become : @xmath123 simply rescaling @xmath124 is not sufficient to regain the original form of the action for generic values of @xmath125 .",
    "the obvious snag is the annoying way the @xmath56-function transforms .",
    "for general values of the momenta @xmath125 , the @xmath56-function is clearly not invariant to the renormalization group transformation .",
    "consequently , we are not technically entitled to compare the coupling before and after , so we do not know the rg flow .",
    "the way out of this dilemma is first to understand the circumstances under which the @xmath56-function is invariant , and then to see what might be happening for more generic cases by considering a soft cutoff .",
    "first , note that when @xmath126 ( i.e. @xmath127 ) the @xmath56-function is always form - invariant since @xmath128 .",
    "the condition @xmath129 can be fulfilled in three different ways : @xmath130 for these values of the momenta , the rescaling @xmath124 works flawlessly because the @xmath56-function is form - invariant under these restrictions .",
    "we are now allowed to compare the coupling before and after . since @xmath131 = 6 $ ] and @xmath132 = -6 $ ] ,",
    "we conclude that , at the tree level , the most relevant pieces of @xmath96 are marginal .",
    "this important result is at the heart of fermi liquid theory , but is expressed by the simple equation : @xmath133 & = & 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in shankar s notation , cases ( i ) and ( ii ) correspond to @xmath134 and case ( iii ) @xmath135 .",
    "it has also been shown  @xcite that case ( i ) remains marginal beyond the tree level , while loop corrections in case ( iii ) lead to a marginally relevant coupling for certain angular momentum channels , indicative of the bcs instability .",
    "let us understand in more detail the circumstances under which the @xmath56-function is always form - invariant .",
    "in particular , we want to stress that the the condition @xmath136 is conceptually different from the limit @xmath137 . to see this ,",
    "let us rewrite the equation @xmath127 as follows : @xmath138 note that equation ( [ eq : kfour ] ) is slightly more accurate than ( [ eq : kfourapprox ] ) .",
    "next , define @xmath139 which obviously gives @xmath140 this says that the vector joining the tip of @xmath111 to the tip of @xmath141 must have magnitude precisely equal to @xmath94 .",

    "however , the three cases corresponding to @xmath136 constitute only a small portion of @xmath146-space . to see what happens to the coupling function @xmath147 for other values of momenta",
    ", shankar had the insight to employ a soft cutoff : @xmath148 .",

    "we choose to write the cutoff in this way because then clearly when @xmath129 , corresponding to the three cases listed above , the cutoff becomes a simple factor of unity . for any @xmath153 , which means all other values of the @xmath125 , the cutoff @xmath154 in the limit @xmath155 provided @xmath156 .",
    "while we do not know how the coupling function @xmath147 scales for values of the momenta where @xmath153 , it does not matter because these couplings will be exponentially suppressed in the limit @xmath157 .",
    "note that the condition @xmath126 is simply the statement that @xmath114 should not scale .",

    "this useful interpretation will be used again later when we extend the formalism to include bosons .    before moving on ,",
    "we need to make another observation about the pure fermion rg that will be important to later generalizations .",

    "this is an illusion since the parameter @xmath289 , which is a measure of the curvature , is allowed to scale in order to precisely compensate the scaling of @xmath263 , thus ensuring that the band remains invariant .",

    "note that this is slightly less general than could be the case .",
    "we have restricted our consideration to nearly forward scattering processes which means that @xmath0 or , equivalently , @xmath293 and @xmath294 belong to the same patch .",
    "inter - patch processes , such as the bcs instability , are not captured .",
    "since we are scaling toward a single point , momentum and energy conserving delta functions and cutoff constraints factorize nicely .",
    "integrating against the delta functions yields @xmath295 where we have placed some of the constraints in the limits of integration . unlike what happened in section  [ sec : bosons+fermions ]",
    ", there is no difference in eliminating boson or fermionic variables due to equations ( [ eq : patchingdimensions ] ) .",
    "here it is arbitrary whether we call momentum @xmath274 or @xmath22 since in the patching scheme they scale the same way .",
    "additionally , the factorization of parallel and perpendicular components of momenta means the arguments of the fields scale in a straightforward fashion . indeed ,",
    "after mode elimination and rescaling we find : @xmath296 where we have taylor expanded @xmath171 and kept the most relevant ( constant ) piece . in this patching scheme ,",
    "the constraints and fields transform in a simple way , so we can simply read off the dimension of the coupling .",
    "@xmath198 & = & \\frac{3-d}{2z } \\label{eq : gdim}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the relevance or irrelevance of this coupling is in some sense arbitrary outside the context of a specific physical problem .",
    "the value of @xmath32 $ ] depends crucially on the dimensions @xmath297 $ ] and @xmath298 $ ] , and these will be determined by the problem under consideration .",
    "for example , in the context of magnetic phases of the kondo lattice , see  @xcite .",
    "several important comments are now in order :    * the result in equation ( [ eq : gdim ] ) is identical to ( [ eq : gdimzequalsone ] ) when @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the patching scheme developed in this section yields an answer equivalent to the extension of shankar s scheme presented in section [ sec : bosons+fermions ] using global coordinates .",
    "while the latter approach is perhaps more intuitive , it is not justifiable when @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the patching scheme requires same careful interpretation , as discussed below , but is consistent for any value of @xmath7 . *",
    "it is necessary to give the curvature parameter , @xmath289 , a non - zero scaling dimension in order to compensate for the way that @xmath84 scales .",
    "rest assured , however , that @xmath299 = [ v_f k_{\\parallel } ] = [ \\epsilon]$ ] so that the fermion band is kept invariant . in this way",
    ", we do not need to scale the number of patches .",
    "* it may seem as if the bosons have become anisotropic , but this is an illusion due to the nature of the local coordinates we have chosen .",
    "because of the sum over patches , we have included an equal weighting of @xmath22 components in all directions , even though locally we only keep @xmath300 within each patch .",
    "of course , it does mean that in the low - energy limit bosons become locally tangent to the fermi surface for fixed value of fermionic momentum @xmath67 .",
    "this is not surprising and was noticed long ago  @xcite .",
    "we even saw hints of this in section  [ sec : bosons+fermions ] . in that scaling scheme @xmath215 and @xmath192 .",
    "when @xmath214 , the length of @xmath301 scales more slowly than the deviation from the fermi surface , @xmath78 . as a result ,",
    "in the low energy limit , the boson momentum will tend to lie tangent to the fermi surface .",
    "* in the patching formalism , the dimension of the boson field in equation ( [ eq : phidimpatch ] ) derives from @xmath302 } \\phi          ( s^{-[q_{\\parallel } ] } q_{\\parallel}^{\\prime } , s^{-[\\vec{q}_{\\perp } ] } \\vec{q}_{\\perp}^{\\prime } , s^{-[\\omega ] } i \\omega^{\\prime } )           \\nonumber\\ ] ] and similarly for the fermion field .",
    "once again this takes the form of a generalized homogeneous function , but is different from the type of scaling in equation ( [ eq : bosonscaling ] ) or ( [ eq : fermionscaling ] ) . for more on generalized homogeneous functions ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "* the form of the interaction we consider is limited to nearly forward scattering ( @xmath303 ) intra - patch processes .",
    "inter - patch processes are not captured , and this makes comparisons with the pure - fermion rg somewhat delicate . consider a four - fermion interaction with incoming momenta @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and outgoing momenta @xmath111 and @xmath106 .",
    "the difference between incoming and outgoing momenta at the left vertex can be small , say @xmath304 .",
    "this can match up with small momentum transfer on the right : @xmath305 .",
    "however , this says nothing about the relationship between @xmath109 and @xmath110 . indeed ,",
    "@xmath109 and @xmath110 can each independently take any value around the fermi surface , _ i.e. _ @xmath306 can take any value between @xmath307 and @xmath250 .",
    "thus , `` forward scattering '' processes in a boson - fermion formalism are not necessarily equivalent to `` forward scattering '' processes in a four - fermion formalism .",
    "the latter ( four - fermion coupling ) involves two patches , whereas the former ( boson - fermion coupling ) involves only one patch . in other words ,",
    "the dimension of @xmath96 is _ not _ simply given by @xmath308 $ ] . *",
    "if we were to include self energy corrections into @xmath65 and establish this as the new fixed point , the values of the dimension assignments would change , but the philosophy would be the same .",
    "for example , in the gauge - spinon  @xcite and ferromagnetic kondo lattice systems  @xcite , gapless overdamped @xmath6 bosons lead to a characteristic electron self energy @xmath309 in @xmath166 and @xmath310 in @xmath168 .",
    "we can define the new fixed - point action with @xmath311 . using the same philosophy defined in this section",
    ", we would assign @xmath312 & = & \\left [ \\epsilon \\right ] = \\left [ \\omega \\right ] = z / d   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "this also leads to a change in the dimensions of the fields and the couplings , but the methodology is no different than what has already been discussed above . see  @xcite for further discussion .",
    "* there is some debate in the literature about how to properly scale the gauge - spinon model which corresponds to @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the consistent scaling scheme within the patching formalism we advocate here coincides with that of  @xcite .",
    "this paper has developed an easy - to - use rg procedure for theories containing both bosons and fermions with a fermi surface .",
    "we reviewed the global coordinate approach to the fermionic rg as formulated by shankar , showed how to generalize this formalism to include bosons with dynamical exponent @xmath5 , and explained why such an approach will not work when @xmath2 .",
    "we pointed out that a consistent scheme must ensure that the kinematic constraints , which result from the conservation of momentum and the effective field theory cutoffs , remain invariant to the rg transformation .",
    "in addition , field rescaling can only be properly identified in interaction terms when the coordinates of the field transform in a known way , as specified by the quadratic part of the action .",
    "we also showed that , for @xmath5 , the same results arise within a patching scheme . here the momentum space near the fermi surface is partitioned into patches . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the patching scheme represents the only consistent rg approach to mixed fermion - boson systems .",
    "coupled boson and fermion problems arise in a variety of contexts .",
    "we have already mentioned the problems of itinerant magnets which have directly motivated our work here , as well as the subject of gauge fields coupled to fermions .",
