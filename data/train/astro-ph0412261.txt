    "2003 ) in the afterglow of the hete-2 localized grb 030329 ( vanderspek et al .",
    "2004 ) has established the association of some of the grbs with core - collapse supernovae from massive stars .",
    "grbs are often hosted by dusty , star - forming galaxies with elevated star formation rates ( sfrs ) of a few  100 @xmath7 yr@xmath3 ( berger et al .",
    "2001 , 2003a ; sokolov et al .",
    "2001 ; frail et al .  2002 ; chary et al .",
    "2002 ) . to sustain such putative vigorous star formation",
    ", it is immediately clear that a large amount of molecular gas , a fuel of massive star formation , must exist in the host galaxies of grbs .",
    "for example , a molecular gas mass of @xmath8 is required in order to keep a sfr of 100 @xmath7 y@xmath3 for @xmath9 yr , which is a typical duration of starburst ( e.g. , thornley et al .",
    "2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "it is also claimed that grbs with undetected , or dark , optical afterglows ( `` dark bursts '' ) probably occur in molecular clouds ( reichart , price 2002 ; but see barnard et al .",
    "2003 ) ; if it is the case , the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) would be drastically affected by grbs ( draine , hao 2002 ) .",
    "in fact , high column densities up to @xmath10 @xmath11 , consistent with the idea of grbs within molecular clouds , are suggested based on an analysis of grb afterglows at x - ray ( galama , wijers 2001 ) .",
    "nevertheless , no observations of molecular gas have been reported toward grb hosts , so far .",
    "this is basically due to the limited sensitivities of the current millimeter - wave facilities .",
    "many of grbs are at a cosmological distance ( @xmath12 ) , but co emission from galaxies beyond @xmath13 is not very easy to observe , unless it is gravitationally amplified or extremely luminous ( e.g. , barvainis et al .",
    "2002 ) .    here , we present a sensitive search for redshifted co @xmath0 emission from the host galaxy of the luminous burst grb 030329/sn 2003dh using the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) .",
    "the continuum emission at millimeter wavelengths was also monitored simultaneously .",
    "grb 030329 is one of the closest objects found among the luminous grbs to date ( @xmath14 = 0.1685 ; greiner et al .",
    "2003 ; caldwell et al .",
    "2003 ) , and therefore a suitable target for a deep search of molecular gas .",
    "millimeter - wave continuum emission from afterglow is also of great interest . because the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of afterglow peaks at millimeter wavelengths on a timescale of a few days after a burst ( e.g. , berger et al .",
    "2000 ) , flux monitoring at mm - wavelengths is very important to determine the peak flux and frequency of the synchrotron spectrum as a function of time from the burst ( e.g. , galama et al .",
    "flux monitoring of afterglow at millimeter wavelengths has been made toward several bright grbs , such as grb 970508 , grb 980329 , grb 991208 , grb 000301c , grb 010222 , and grb 030329 ( e.g. , bremer et al .  1998 ; taylor et al .",

    "assuming a cosmology with @xmath15 = 71 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath16 = 0.27 , and @xmath17 = 0.73 , the luminosity distance of grb 030329 is @xmath18 = 805 mpc , and the angular distance is @xmath19 = 589 mpc ( @xmath20 corresponds to 2.86 kpc ) .",
    "we observed grb 030329 using nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) during the period from 2003 april 6 to 2003 may 30 .",
    "nma consists of six 10 m dishes equipped with cryogenically cooled receivers employing superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis ) mixers in double side band ( dsb ) operation . the most compact configuration ( d array ; baseline lengths ranged from 13 m to 82 m )",
    "was used for the observations , except for the first two days ( c array for april 6 and 7 ; baseline lengths were from 26 m to 163 m ) . for 3 mm observations ,",
    "the tracking frequency was set to 98.825 ghz to observe a redshifted co(10 ) line ( @xmath21 98.65 ghz ) at the upper side band ( usb ) , whereas the lower side band ( lsb ) , centered at 86.825 ghz , ( and line - free channels of usb ) was for the continuum .",
    "the center frequencies of usb and lsb for 2 mm observations were 146.969 ghz and 134.969 ghz , respectively .",
    "each side band was separated by 90@xmath22 phase switching of a reference signal .",
    "the ultra wide - band correlator ( okumura et al .",
    "2000 ) was configured to cover a bandwidth of 1024 mhz per side - band with an 8 mhz resolution .    a radio source , j1159 + 292 ,",
    "was observed every @xmath21 20 minutes for amplitude and phase calibrations , and the passband shape of the system was determined from observations of strong continuum sources , 3c 273 or j0423013 .",
    "we also observed j1058 + 015 several times during each observing run to check the consistency of the amplitude calibration .",
    "the flux density of j1159 + 292 was determined several times during the observing run ; it ranged from 1.6 to 2.3 jy . in this paper",
    ", we adopted a constant flux value of 2.0 jy throughout our observing run .",
    "this gave almost the same flux scale as the ovro / bima results ( sheth et al .",
    "2003 ; 1.95 jy was adopted to the data ) .",
    "the overall error of the absolute flux scale was estimated to about @xmath23 20% .",
    "the raw visibilities were edited and calibrated using the nro uvproc - ii package ( tsutsumi et al .",
    "1997 ) , and then usb and lsb data were concatenated to produce a final continuum image of each day using the nrao aips task imagr .    for a spectral line analysis ,",
    "the continuum emission was subtracted first from the visibilities using the uvproc - ii task lcont , if continuum was detected .",
    "then , each data set was combined into a single visibility set , and channel maps with a width of 32 mhz ( 97.2 km s@xmath3 ) at an increment of 16 mhz ( 48.6 km s@xmath3 ) were produced .",
    "an unresolved 2 mm/3 mm continuum source was detected at the position of grb 030329 from 2003 april 6 to april 21 .",
    "the observational log is provided in table 1 .",
    "some selected continuum images , showing a fading afterglow emission , are presented in figure 1 , and the obtained millimeter - wave light curve is given in figure 2 .",
    "the visibilities often suffered from large phase noises of atmospheric origin . to estimate the effect of the phase noise , we made images of the visibility calibrator source j1159 + 292 as well .",
    "we found that the decorrelation factors were typically @xmath21 0.95 , which decreased to 0.90 for the worst case .",
    "the obtained flux densities listed in table 1 are after a correction of the decorrelation .      neither significant emission nor an absorption feature was detected from individual spectra of each day .",
    "this is consistent with a report by sheth et al .",
    "however , by summing up the data at 3 mm from 2003 april 10 to may 30 , we found a possible emission feature from this integrated spectrum .",
    "figure 3 displays the spectrum , and a velocity - integrated image of the possible emission feature .",
    "note that the data on april 15 was not included in the final spectrum , because the weight of the data was very small due to its larger system noise temperature .",
    "the spectrum shows an emission feature with a peak flux density of @xmath24 mjy at 98.62 ghz , corresponding to a redshift of @xmath25 , if this is co @xmath0 emission .",
    "the significance of the emission feature is low ( @xmath26 ) , but this feature appears on several successive channels , from @xmath27 to 0.1689 .",
    "this is within the range of the reported grb 030329 redshifts determined from optical emission / absorption lines , 0.1685 ( greiner et al .",
    "2003 ) to 0.169 @xmath23 0.001 ( price et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the velocity width of this feature is @xmath28 km s@xmath3 .",
    "if we integrated the possible emission feature over the velocity width of 220 km s@xmath3 , we found a @xmath29 source at the position of grb 030329 ( figure 3 , right panel ) .",
    "the integrated co flux density is @xmath2 jy km s@xmath3 .",
    "the position and redshift coincide well with those of grb 030329 , though we need further observations to confirm this possible emission - line feature .",
    "the overall appearance of our millimeter - wave light curve in table 1 and figure 2 is consistent with the ovro / bima ( sheth et al .",
    "2003 ) and nro 45 m telescope ( kuno et al .",
    "2004 ) results ; i.e. , a rapid decay of millimeter - wave afterglow has been observed .",
    "figure 4 shows a comparison of @xmath30 = 3 mm measurements of grb 030329 afterglow from nma , ovro / bima , and the 45 m telescope .",
    "a least - squares fit of all 3 mm observations during @xmath31 = 9 to 23 gives a temporal decay index of @xmath32 , where millimeter flux , @xmath33 , decays as @xmath34 .",
    "the steep slope observed at millimeter - wavelengths , close to the decay indices after the jet break at @xmath35 days at optical wavelengths ( @xmath36 , price et al .",
    "2003 ; @xmath37 , sato et al .",
    "2003 ) , suggests that the expansion during this period ( @xmath31 = 9 to 23 ) still remained relativistic ( e.g. , frail et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "in addition to the rapid decay , our data also implies that the decay was accompanied by possible `` plateau '' phases , or `` bumps '' , with a time scale of @xmath21 several days .",
    "one can see that the flux densities in figure 2 are almost constant from @xmath31 = 12 to 17 days ( three days average is 17.6 mjy ) , whereas it drops suddenly at @xmath31 = 18 , and then the light curve becomes constant again till @xmath31 = 23 ( average is 9.0 mjy ) .",
    "the difference between these two plateau levels , a factor of 2 , is significantly larger than the estimated overall flux uncertainty , @xmath21 20% . in figure 4 , these possible plateaus / bumps are not very evident , however .",
    "this could be because the fluxes in figure 4 were determined from different instruments , causing a significant error in the absolute calibration .",
    "note that the detection of fluctuation at millimeter - wavelengths is important because the effect of interstellar scattering / scintillation , which could be significant for radio light curves ( e.g. , frail et al .",
    "2000 ) , is mitigated at millimeter - wave light curves ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is intriguing to see whether these possible bumps on the millimeter - wave light curve are achromatic or not , because simultaneous multi - wavelengths light curves provide a crucial clue to the origin of the bumps on the light curves ( e.g. , nakar et al .",
    "unfortunatelly , a detailed optical light curve compiled by lipkin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) lacks data points from @xmath31 @xmath21 14 to 21 days , where we find millimeter - wave bumps .",
    "bloom et al.(2004 ) also presents late - phase ( @xmath38 days ) optical / near - infrared light curves , yet their light curves also have gaps from @xmath31 = 13 to 23 days .",
    "some of the bumps or rebrightening events seen in optical / nir bands are often explained by a `` refreshed shock '' model ( e.g. , granot et al .",
    "2003 ) , yet it remains unclear whether radio / millimeter - wave light curves can also be understood by this model ( berger et al .",
    "2003b ; sheth et al .",
    "2003 ; frail et al .",
    "2004 ) . if the observed plateaus / bumps in the millimeter - wave light curve are caused by density fluctuations of surrounding ism ( e.g. , wang , loeb 2000 ) , the spatial scale of the structure corresponding to the time scale of the observed bumps , several days , is about @xmath39 au , supposing a relativistic expansion .",
    "small - scale structures of a dense molecular medium with such a spatial scale , a few 100 au to 1000 au , have been found in the galactic star - forming regions ( kamazaki et al .",
    "2001 ) .",

    "although the detection of the co line from grb 030329 should be confirmed by additional / independent observations , if the emission - line feature in figure 3 is real , it gives valuable information about ism in the host galaxy of grb 030329 .      the integrated co flux , @xmath2 jy km s@xmath3 , gives a coarse estimation of the molecular gas mass using a formula ( solomon et al .  1992 ) , as follows : @xmath40                       \\left ( \\frac{s_{\\rm co}\\delta v}{1.4 \\mbox{\\ jy km s$^{-1}$ } } \\right ) \\\\               &    & \\cdot                      \\left ( \\frac{d_{\\rm l}}{805 \\mbox{\\ mpc } } \\right)^2                     \\left ( 1+\\frac{z}{0.1685 } \\right)^{-1 }                      \\mbox{\\ } m_\\odot,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the co luminosity to h@xmath5 molecular gas mass conversion factor , @xmath42 is the co line luminosity , @xmath43 is the velocity - integrated co flux , and @xmath18 is the luminosity distance .",
    "the co line luminosity , @xmath42 , is @xmath44 [ k km s@xmath3 pc@xmath45 .",
    "the deduced mass reaches @xmath46 @xmath7 , if a galactic conversion factor , @xmath47 [ @xmath11 ( k km s@xmath3)@xmath3 ] ( dame et al .",
    "2001 ) or @xmath49 in a unit of [ @xmath7 ( k km s@xmath3 pc@xmath50)@xmath3 ] , is applied .",
    "the molecular gas mass derived here is comparable to those in massive and luminous spiral galaxies ( e.g. , nishiyama , nakai 2001 , and references therein ) , and significantly larger than the molecular gas masses in metal - poor dwarf galaxies . for instance , the total molecular gas mass of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is @xmath4(h@xmath5 ) = @xmath51 ( fukui et al .",
    "1999 ) , adopting an @xmath52 of @xmath53 [ @xmath11 ( k km s@xmath3)@xmath3 ] , determined from their own observations .",
    "similarly , the molecular gas mass of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is @xmath4(h@xmath5 ) = @xmath54 by applying @xmath55 [ @xmath11 ( k km s@xmath3)@xmath3 ] ( mizuno et al .",
    "2001 ) , though this is a lower limit because their observation covered only a part of the smc .",
    "accordingly , the suggested molecular gas mass up to @xmath56 in grb 030329 is surprisingly large if one recalls that the host of grb 030329 is rather faint in optical bands ; the absolute magnitude of the host galaxy is just comparable to that of smc ( fruchter et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "one of the error sources of the deduced molecular gas mass is the co luminosity to h@xmath5 molecular gas mass conversion factor .",
    "the molecular gas mass becomes even larger ( by a factor of @xmath21 10 ) if we apply an @xmath52 valid for low - metal galaxies ( e.g. , arimoto et al .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath52 factors derived in ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) can reduce the gas mass by a factor of @xmath21 3  4 ( downes , solomon 1998 ) . in any case , supposing that the detection is real , a large amount of molecular gas , exceeding @xmath56 , must be present in the host galaxy of grb 030329 .      if the velocity width of the possible co emission feature originated from rotation of the molecular gas , one can estimate an enclosed mass in the central region of the host galaxy by assuming the radius of a rotating gas disk and its inclination angle .",
    "the enclosed mass , often referred to as the dynamical mass @xmath57 , is @xmath58 ^ 2 \\mbox{\\ } m_\\odot \\\\               & = & 3.2 \\times 10^{10 } \\left ( \\frac{r}{5.7 \\mbox{\\ kpc } } \\right )                                    \\left ( \\frac{\\delta v/2}{110 \\mbox{\\ km s$^{-1}$ } } \\right)^2                                   \\left [ \\sin \\left ( \\frac{i}{45 } \\right ) \\right]^{-2 } \\mbox{\\ } m_\\odot,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the radius of the gas disk , @xmath60 is an on - plane rotation velocity at a radius of @xmath59 , @xmath61 is an observed line width , and @xmath62 is the inclination of the disk ( @xmath63 is face - on ) . here",
    ", we adopt the radius of the disk as @xmath59 = ( or 5.7 kpc ) , an upper limit on the source size from our co map , and an inclination angle of @xmath64 , which is difficult to determine at this moment . in this case , the molecular gas mass shears about 17% of the total ( dynamical ) mass in the central kiloparsecs of the host galaxy .",
    "the major uncertainty of @xmath57 is inclination .",
    "if the disk is close to edge - on ( @xmath65 for instance ) , @xmath57 is reduced to be @xmath66 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath57 could exceed @xmath67 when the disk is closer to face - on ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "@xmath69 is then @xmath21 1% to 10% , which is a typical range seen in nearby gas - rich spiral galaxies ( e.g. , nishiyama , nakai 2001 ) .",
    "a gas - rich condition in the host galaxy of grb 030329 , suggested by our observations , implies the presence of an intense star - formation / starburst there because molecular gas masses roughly correlate with the rates of massive star formation ( e.g. , young et al .",
    "1996 ) . however , a sfr in the host of grb 030329 , determined from an extinction - corrected h@xmath70 luminosity , is 0.5 @xmath7 yrs@xmath3 ( matheson et al .",
    "2003 ) , which is quite modest and not so enhanced compared with starburst galaxies ( e.g. , kennicutt 1998 ) . here",
    ", we should note that the sfrs derived from the optical emission lines could underestimate the true rate of massive star formation if it is deeply embedded within dense molecular material .",
    "in fact , it is reported that the sfrs in some grb hosts ( such as grb 980703 , grb 000210 , grb 000418 , and grb 010222 ) , derived from optical observations , are much lower",
    "( by an order of magnitude ) than those from radio / submillimeter measurements , even after an extinction correction ( berger et al .  2001 , 2003a ; frail et al .  2002 ; gorosabel et al .",
    "this situation suggests that optical emission does not fully trace the whole massive star - forming regions in these grb hosts ; this could be the case in grb 030329 .",
    "for instance , it is likely that the unobscured sfr in the host galaxy of grb 030329 is 10-times larger than the sfr derived from optical data , as in the case of many grb hosts ( berger et al .",
    "then , the `` true '' sfr could be @xmath21 5 @xmath7 yrs@xmath3 , and the expected radio ( 1.4 ghz ) and submillimeter ( 350 ghz ) fluxes , originated from star formation in the host galaxy , would be @xmath21 0.3 mjy and @xmath21 0.1 mjy , respectively , according to fomulae by carilli and yun ( 1999 ) . such a flux at 1.4 ghz should be detectable using vla when the afterglow emission has been disapperaed .    consequently , further multiwavelengths studies from radio to infrared , as well as additional deeper co observations , are indispensable to unveil the true properties of star formation and to confirm the presence of a large amount of ism , in the host galaxy of grb 030329 .",

    "<S> moreover , our data implies that the decay was accompanied by possible plateaus phases , or bumps , on a time scale of several days . from an integrated spectrum , produced by summing up the data from 2003 april 10 to 2003 may 30 </S>",
    "<S> , we found a possible emission feature , which could be a redshifted co @xmath0 line . </S>",
    "<S> its position and redshift coincide well with those of grb 030329 , though further observations are required to confirm the detection . </S>",
    "<S> if the emission feature is real , the observed co flux is @xmath2 jy km s@xmath3 , corresponding to a large molecular gas mass of @xmath4(h@xmath5 ) @xmath6 @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the host galaxy , which is optically faint , is highly obscured due to a rich interstellar medium . </S>"
