    "we study the process @xmath0 , where one of the protons is transversely polarized and the jet has a large transverse momentum . specifically , we calculate the azimuthal asymmetries in the distribution of leading pions around the jet axis within the so - called transverse momentum dependent framework , which takes into account all the possible spin and intrinsic parton motion effects , assuming the validity of perturbative qcd factorization . within this approach ,",
    "the leading - twist azimuthal asymmetries are expressed in terms of convolutions of different transverse momentum dependent distribution and fragmentation functions ( tmds ) @xcite .",
    "we focus on the ones which are the most relevant from a phenomenological point of view , namely the sivers distribution function and the collins fragmentation function . by defining appropriate moments of the asymmetries",
    ", it is possible to separate the effects due to these two different tmds , in strong analogy with the case of semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) .",
    "this will also help in clarifying the role played by the sivers and the collins mechanisms in the sizable single - spin asymmetries observed at rhic for inclusive pion production , where these two effects can not be isolated .",
    "in the hadronic center - of - mass , or in any other frame connected to it by a boost along the direction of the two colliding protons , the single - transverse polarized cross section for the process @xmath0 , at leading order in pqcd , can be written as @xcite @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the azimuthal angle of the proton spin vector @xmath3 relative to the jet production plane and @xmath4 being the azimuthal angle of the three - momentum of the pion around the jet axis , as measured in the helicity frame of the fragmenting quark or gluon @xcite .    by means of the azimuthal moments",

    "in this section the collins and sivers asymmetries are evaluated at the rhic energy @xmath11 gev and at forward jet rapidity , within the generalized parton model ( gpm ) approach , according to which tmds are considered to be process independent @xcite . in our analysis , two different sets of parameterizations for the tmds have been used , named sidis  1 and sidis  2 @xcite .    the collins asymmetry @xmath12 , presented in fig .",
    "[ asy - an - coll - par200 ] , is mainly given by a convolution of the collins fragmentation function and the transversity distribution .",
    "we note that our prediction of a negligible value of @xmath12 for neutral pions has been confirmed by preliminary rhic data @xcite . the sivers asymmetry @xmath13 is shown in fig .",

    "we have taken it positive , saturating an upper bound derived from the analysis of phenix data for central production of neutral pions @xcite .",

    "[ asy - an - coll - par200 ] and [ asy - an - siv - par200 ] delimit the range @xmath14 in which tmds are presently constrained by sidis data . their extrapolation beyond this region leads to results plagued by large uncertainties .",
    "hence a measurement of the proposed observables would shed light on the large @xmath15 behavior of the sivers and the transversity distribution functions .",
    "in contrast to the gpm approach adopted in the previous section , in the color gauge invariant ( cgi ) gpm @xcite tmds can be process dependent , due to the effects of initial ( isi ) and final ( fsi ) state interactions . a fundamental example ( still to be confirmed by experiments )",
    "is provided by the isi in sidis and the fsi in the dy processes , which lead to two quark sivers functions with an opposite relative sign . for the reaction under study the quark sivers function",
    "has in general a more involved color structure , since both isi and fsi contribute @xcite .",
    "however , at forward rapidities only the @xmath16 channel gives a dominant contribution . as a consequence , our predictions for the sivers asymmetries obtained with and without isi and fsi are comparable in size but have opposite signs , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] at the rhic energy @xmath17 gev .",
    "therefore the measurement of a sizable asymmetry would verify one of the two approaches and test the process dependence of the sivers function .",
    "finally , we have also studied single - spin asymmetries for inclusive jet production , which are described solely by the sivers function @xcite .",
    "our predictions for @xmath13 turn out to be very similar to the ones for jet - neutral pion production , shown in the central panel of fig .",

    "these results seem to agree with the gpm predictions only for @xmath19 and suggest the need for further studies along these lines , aiming to confirm or disprove the validity of our factorization hypotesis and to test the universality properties of the different tmds .",
