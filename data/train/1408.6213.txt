    "such approximations , often referred to as the  quasi-1d dynamics \"  @xcite , allow access to the complete integrability theory of the 1d cubic nls equation along with its plethora of special solutions that give theoretical explanations of fundamental phenomena in bose - einstein condensates . on the other hand , from a purely mathematical point of view",
    ", the analysis falls under the recent progress and interest in understanding the asymptotic behavior of nonlinear dispersive equations in the presence of a confinement .",
    "such a confinement can come from the compactness ( or partial compactness ) of the domain or via a trapping potential . in either case , this leads to the complete or partial loss of dispersive decay of linear solutions , and consequently complicating and diversifying the picture of long - time dynamics . in this line , using tools developed for the study of long - time dynamics of nonlinear schrdinger equations on product spaces , we will be able to describe the asymptotic dynamics and show that they exhibit highly nonlinear behavior in striking contrast to linear scattering . as a consequence of this description , we get the general extension of the  quasi-1d approximation \" mentioned above to cases when higher and multiple energy levels of the harmonic trap are excited ( cf . section  [ sect13 ] ) .",
    "a bose - einstein condensate ( bec for short ) is an aggregate of matter ( bosons ) which appears at very low temperature and which is due to the fact that all particles are in the same quantum state .",
    "their existence was predicted by bose in 1924 for photons and by einstein in 1925 for atoms , and they were experimentally observed in 1995 by w.  ketterle , a.  cornell and c.  wieman who were awarded a nobel prize shortly after , in 2001 , for this achievement .",
    "this observation was followed by a burst of activity in the theoretical and experimental study of bec which constitutes a rare manifestation of a quantum phenomenon which shows through at a macroscopic level .",
    "for an nice introduction to this topic we refer to the book  @xcite and to  @xcite .    in the physical space @xmath9 , bec",
    "can be realized by trapping particles using a magnetic trap which is modelled in the mean - field theory by the harmonic potential term in  .",
    "the wave function @xmath10 of the particles in   ( with @xmath3 ) can be interpreted as the probability density of finding particles at point @xmath11 and time @xmath12 .",
    "the sign @xmath13 or @xmath14 depends on whether the boson interaction is attractive ( focusing case ) or repulsive ( defocusing ) .    in the case",
    "when @xmath15 , the harmonic trap is often described as  cigar - shaped \" , and we will be interested in this case .",
    "this regime is of great importance from the physical point of view as it allows for a  dimensional reduction \" in which the condensate is described by better - understood lower - dimensional dynamics .",
    "more precisely , a naturally adopted approximation of is obtained by going to the anisotropic limit and setting @xmath16 ( which is justified for @xmath17 not too large ) and non - dimensionalizing @xmath18 .",
    "then , the resulting equation is @xmath19    in this context , ( see for instance  @xcite or  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paragraph1.3.2 ) ) physicists often adopt an ansatz of the form @xmath20 which leads them through a multiple time - scale expansion to the 1d - dynamics obeyed by @xmath21 .",
    "this dynamics is given by none other than the one dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath22 this equation is obtained by projecting the nonlinear term in the ansatz equation on the groundstate @xmath23 of the harmonic oscillator @xmath24 , thus @xmath25=1/2 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to describe the large time behaviour of   for small , smooth and decaying data ( and more generally for the corresponding equations in higher dimension ) .",
    "one consequence of our work is a justification of the approximation   for large times , as well as the correct extension of that approximation when higher and/or multiple energy levels of the quantum harmonic oscillator are excited .",
    "we give the relevant result concerning the approximation   and refer to the next section for more general and precise results .",
    "denote by @xmath26 the set of the schwartz functions , then    [ thm0 ] let @xmath27 be small enough , and let @xmath28 be the solution of  .",
    "then there exists a solution @xmath29 of such that @xmath30 moreover , the function @xmath31 can be chosen to be axisymmetric : @xmath32 for some @xmath33 .",
    "this shows that the 1d dynamics of   can be embedded in the 3d dynamics of  , a reduction , known as _",
    "quasi 1d dynamics _ , which is at the basis of the theoretical explanation of many fundamental phenomena in bose - einstein condensates .",
    "physicists arrive at it using some multiple time - scale approximations , and use it afterwards to transfer information from the well - understood and completely integrable dynamics of   to that of  .",
    "we refer to section[sect13 ] for more details and extensions .",
    "we remark that the nonlinear schrdinger equation with harmonic potential is also an important model in nonlinear optics , but we do not detail the applications in this context .      from the mathematical perspective , this work falls under the recent developments in the study of the long - time behavior of nonlinear dispersive equations that are confined either by physical domain or by a potential .",
    "such a confinement has a direct effect on the linear decay afforded by dispersion which either completely disappears or becomes very weak . in the case of a confinement by domain",
    ", we refer to  @xcite for references on global regularity issues .",
    "the question of long - time behavior is much more subtle and much less is known especially on compact domains . in that case , many different long - time dynamics can be sustained starting from arbitrarily small neighborhoods of the zero initial data including kam tori  @xcite , arnold diffusion orbits  @xcite , and coherent frequency dynamics  @xcite .",
    "a bit more can be said about the asymptotic behavior in the partially periodic cases ( _ e.g. _ waveguides @xmath34 ) where one can see an interplay between the persistence of the euclidean behavior of scattering  @xcite versus the emergence of new asymptotic dynamics that reflect the ( global ) non - euclidean geometry of the underlying manifold .",
    "the latter was observed in  @xcite that studied nls on the product domain @xmath35 which corresponds to the non - compact quotient of @xmath36 where linear solutions decay the least , namely like @xmath37 .",
    "there , the resonant periodic interactions played a key role in the asymptotic dynamics either for all small data  @xcite or in the analysis of certain sequences of data that appear in the profile decomposition  @xcite .",
    "we will see that a similar picture can be drawn in the case of a potential trap confinement . studying ( nls ) under full harmonic trapping would be the analogue of studying it on a compact domain , whereas studying it with partial trapping corresponds to a partially compact domain . indeed",

    ". we will be interested in this case in which the equation can be written as @xmath55 where we have set @xmath56 since the nonlinearity decays at best like @xmath57 in @xmath58 , a modification of the scattering operator might be needed to describe the asymptotic dynamics .",
    "this is indeed the case and the modification will be given by the _",
