    "in continuous variables quantum systems , the nonclassicality of a state is closely related to the nonclassicality of the corresponding quasiprobability distribution functions in phase space @xcite .",
    "because of the uncertainty principle , it is not possible to define a unique well - defined distribution function , however , there exists a continuous family of quasiprobability distribution functions @xmath1 ranging from the husimi function @xmath2 to the glauber - sudarshan function @xmath3 as @xmath4 ranges from @xmath5 to @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the displacement operator , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 as annihilation and creation operators satisfying @xmath10=1 $ ] .",
    "the husimi @xmath0 function @xcite is defined by @xmath11 and the glauber - sudarshan @xmath12 function @xcite is a diagonal representation of the state operator @xmath13 in the coherent state @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 . the case @xmath16 corresponds to the wigner function @xcite and is an especially important case because integrals of the wigner function yield the correct quantum mechanical marginal distributions for position and momentum @xcite .",
    "although the husimi @xmath0 function can never become negative , it is not the case for the other ones , in the sense that there exist states for which @xmath17 is not a regular distribution function for any @xmath4 . in particular , the wigner function @xmath18 is not always positive and the glauber - sudarshan @xmath12 function can become negative or more singular than a delta function over some region of phase space .",
    "a state whose wigner function takes on negative values over some region of phase space is nonclassical , however , the converse is not necessarily true , i.e. there exist states with positive wigner function which show nonclassical properties .",
    "perhaps one of the most important application of the wigner function is in the classification of continuous variables quantum states according to the classical vs nonclassical and gaussian vs non - gaussian paradigms @xcite . for pure one- and multi - mode states ,",
    "it was proven by hudson @xcite and soto and claverie @xcite , respectively , that the gaussian states , i.e. states for which the associated wigner function is a gaussian function , are the only pure states which have nonnegative wigner functions .",
    "steps toward the extension of the hudson theorem to characterize mixed quantum states with a positive wigner function @xcite have been made by finding upper and lower bounds on the degree of non - gaussianity of states with positive wigner functions @xcite , and looking at criteria to detect quantum non - gaussian states , i.e. nonclassical states that can not be expressed as a convex mixture of gaussian states @xcite .    with the rise of quantum information science , other important signature of quantumness and the role of negativity of the wigner function as an indicator",
    "have attracted attentions .",
    "it is shown that quantum non - gaussian states with positive wigner functions are not useful for quantum computation @xcite , implies that the negativity of the wigner function can be grasped as a resource in quantum computing and simulation . in view of this",
    ", efforts have been made to suggest quantitative measures of nonclassicality either as the volume of the negative part of the wigner function @xcite , or as the distance to the convex subset of positive wigner functions @xcite .",
    "quantum correlation is a manifestation of nonclassicality of composite quantum systems , and a question arises as to whether the negative wigner function can be interpreted as a sign of the quantumness of correlation .",
    "two aspects of quantum correlations are quantum entanglement @xcite and quantum discord @xcite . quantum entanglement is defined within the entanglement - separability paradigm @xcite ; a bipartite state @xmath13 is entangled if it is not separable , i.e. if it can not be written as a convex combination of product states as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are states on @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively . in the light of this ,",
    "the well - defined positive @xmath12 function of a two - mode state is a sufficient condition for separability , i.e. @xmath24 .",
    "however , we have to mention that it s negativity does not necessarily mean entanglement because this negativity could be the result of nonclassicality of a local state or correlations beyond entanglement @xcite .",
    "although the amount of entanglement is invariant under local unitary transformations , nonclassicality does not possess this property .",
    "@xcite utilized this property for gaussian states , and found local unitary operations to remove all the local manifestations of nonclassicality with the goal of reducing global nonclassicality as much as possible , leading to the equivalence between criteria of nonclassicality and entanglement . however , entanglement is not the only aspect of quantum correlations and there exist quantum correlations that can not be captured by entanglement . in @xcite ollivier and zurek",
    "have introduced quantum discord as a measure of quantum correlation beyond entanglement ( see also @xcite ) , and it is discovered that it can be responsible for the quantum efficiency of deterministic quantum computation with one qubit @xcite .",
    "quantum discord is defined from an information - theoretic perspective ; a bipartite state @xmath13 is said to have nonclassical correlation with respect to part @xmath25 if it can not be distinguished locally on part @xmath25 , i.e. if it is not possible to find orthonormal basis @xmath26 of @xmath22 such that @xmath13 can be written as @xmath27 . in @xcite it has been shown that the set of classical - classical states , i.e. separable states that are locally distinguishable and do not possess quantum discord in any side , and the set of states with a positive @xmath12 representation are almost disjoint and they are maximally inequivalent . in another word ,",
    "the set of positive @xmath12 functions do not often includes the set of zero - discord states , and vice versa .",
    "an important difference between the quantum correlation within the entanglement - separability paradigm and the one described by the information - theoretic perspective is the fact that quantum entanglement can not increase under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) but quantum discord would be increased .",
    "moreover , it has been pointed out that @xcite local operations performed on a classical state can produce a state with nonzero quantum discord . very recently , mani _",
    "_ @xcite have considered two sets of separable bell - diagonal states which have different nonzero quantum correlations , although they are prepared by the same type of quantum operations acting on classically correlated states with equal classical correlations .",
    "they have investigated this difference and found that it is related to the hidden classical correlation which is needed for preparation of these states .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the possible connection between nonclassicality in phase space and nonclassical correlation .",
    "in particular , we concentrate on the negativity of the wigner function as an indicator of the nonclassicality in phase space and the nonclassical correlation defined from an information - theoretic aspect , i.e. quantum discord . to this aim",
    "we introduce two two - mode separable states with nonzero quantum discord , and study their nonclassicality both from the nonclassicality in phase space and the existence of nonclassical correlations .",
    "our motivation to choose these states is that : ( i ) both states are classical within the entanglement - separability paradigm , but they are nonclassical when we look them from the information - theoretic perspective .",
    "( ii ) the states possess the same marginal states with positive wigner functions .",
    "( iii ) the wigner functions of these states are negative with different values of negativity . having these states , we first look at various manifestation of phase space nonclassicalities and find that although these states possess different negativities of the wigner function , they do not manifest this difference as the phase space nonclassicalities such as negativity of the mandel parameter or quadrature squeezing .",
    "we then focus our attention to the quantum correlations of these states and quantify their quantum correlations by original quantum discord @xcite , local quantum uncertainty ( lqu ) @xcite , and geometric discord @xcite .",
    "we find that quantum correlation reveals this difference in the sense that the state with more negativity of the wigner function possesses more quantum correlation , measured by either the quantum discord @xcite or by lqu .",
    "the non - gaussianity of these states is also examined and it is shown that the difference between their non - gaussianity is the same as the difference between negativity of their wigner functions .",
    "further , we study the role of the correlation rank criterion in revealing quantum correlation by negativity of the wigner function . for this purpose",
    "we introduce two other separable states with the same nonzero quantum discord .",
    "moreover , in contrary to the previous case , the introduced states are such that the associated correlation rank of these states is 2 , so that their quantum correlations can be created by local channels @xcite . in this case , our calculations show that both states and their marginals possess the same positive wigner functions .",
    "our results show that the ability of wigner function to capture the quantum correlation is failed when the states can be produced locally from classical states .    finally , we consider two classical states which possess the same positive local wigner functions , but their global wigner functions are negative .",
    "the negativity of global wigner function of these states are different , however they do not exhibit squeezing and their mandel q parameters take the same negative values . looking at the states show that the states change to each other by local unitary transformation , an operation that leaves invariant classical , quantum and total correlations . so that the difference between negativities of these states can not be explained by aforementioned nonclassicalities .",
    "this lead us to introduce a new quantity using a local unitary operation that bring local subsystems to classical and , at the same time , reduce the amount of the negativity of the wigner function of the state as much as possible @xcite . by definition",
    "such defined quantity is invariant under local unitary operations performed on the subsystems and associate to each state , up to a local unitary operation , a unique measure of nonclassicality .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce two two - mode states and study their wigner functions . the negativity of their wigner functions as well as their mandel parameters and degrees of squeezing are also examined in this section .",
    "section iii is devoted to the quantum correlations of these states . in section iv",
    ", we study two quantum correlated states with rank 2 and study the role of correlation rank criterion .",
    "we conclude the paper in section v with a brief discussion .",
    "an important class of states of the continuous variables quantum systems is the so - called coherent states @xcite .",
    "coherent states result from applying the displacement operator @xmath28 to the vacuum state @xmath29 of the quantized field , i.e. @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "they constitute the overcomplete set of the eigenstates of the annihilation operator @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath32 , and can be expressed in terms of the photon - number states @xmath33 as @xmath34 . moreover , coherent states are the only states minimizing the heisenberg uncertainty relation , and their photon number distribution is the poissonian statistics , i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "now , let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be two coherent states of the single - mode hilbert space @xmath38 , ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "obviously , these states are not orthogonal in the sense that @xmath40 .",
    "however , one can define two orthogonal states @xmath41 , @xmath42 , i.e. even and odd coherent states @xcite , as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the normalization constant .",
    "with these preliminary single - mode states in hand , we are now in a position to define two two - mode states @xmath45 and @xmath46 , acting on the hilbert space @xmath47 , as @xmath48 @xmath49 interestingly , both of these states have the same marginal states with respect to the modes @xmath25 and @xmath50 , i.e. defining @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath52 $ ] , we find @xmath53 it turns out that the wigner function of the above state can be written as @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the wigner function of the pure state @xmath56 . using eq .",
    "and the combination rule for the displacement operator as @xmath57 , we get @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "clearly , both @xmath62 and @xmath63 are nonnegative , but @xmath64 and @xmath65 may take negative values for some values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "however , the sum of these latter wigner functions become positive in the whole phase space . to see this , and for further use ,",
    "let us rewrite the local wigner function as @xmath68 where @xmath69 evidently , both @xmath70 and @xmath71 are nonnegative everywhere in phase space , so that local state possesses nonnegative wigner function , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ figlocalwigner ] for @xmath72 .     and @xmath46 , with @xmath72 . ]",
    "now in order to calculate the wigner function of the global states and , we need to use the fact that the wigner function of the product states is given by the product of the wigner functions of each part , i.e. @xmath73 . using this we find @xmath74 @xmath75 these wigner functions are not positive in the whole phase space .",
    "negativity of the wigner function is a witness of nonclassicality of the state , so that measuring any departure from positivity of the wigner function may be used as a quantitative witness of the nonclassicality of the state . to this aim",
    ", we use the volume of the negative part of the wigner function @xcite as a measure of the nonclassicality .",
    "more precisely , the nonclassical volume is defined as a quadruple volume of the integrated negative part of the wigner function of a two mode quantum state as @xcite @xmath76 using this definition , one can calculate negativity of the wigner function for the states above . in fig .",

    "now , we have two composite systems whose subsystems possess the same positive wigner functions , whereas their global wigner functions retain negative values . as the classicality of the subsystems is not sufficient for the nonclassicality of the overall state to be identified with entanglement @xcite ,",
    "this nonclassicality is due to various nonclassicality in phase space , such as squeezing or quantum statistics , or it may be interpreted as a signature of other correlations , such as classical correlation or quantum correlation beyond entanglement .     for states @xmath45 ( blue , solid line ) and",

    "it follows that although a coherent state possesses a maximum coherence between the photon numbers , all the photon number detections are independent . on the other hand , when for the same mean photon number the distribution has a larger or smaller variance than a poissonian distribution , the distribution is called super - poissonian or sub - poissonian , respectively .",

    "the mandel @xmath0 parameter is defined as the normalized variance of the photon distribution and in each mode is defined by @xmath111 hence , the q parameter for both of the states @xmath45 and @xmath46 takes the same value @xmath112 for @xmath39 , which clearly takes negative value for all @xmath79 . as a matter of fact the notion of mandel parameter defined by eq . for each mode of the two - mode states",
    "is a trivial extension of the definition formulated primarily @xcite for one - mode situations .",

    "_ quantum states with correlation rank 2. _ to provide additional insight for understanding the role of rank in such states , let us consider the following rank 2 states , obtained from the first two terms of states and @xmath204 @xmath205 respectively .",

    "let us define the channel @xmath206 as @xmath207 applying this channel to both modes as @xmath208 , we lead to @xmath209 where @xmath210 and @xmath211 are two classical states given in eqs . and .    for both states @xmath212 and @xmath213 , the wigner function of the local states",

    "moreover , in this case both states possess the same amount of classical and total correlations .",
    "a comparison of the above results with the results we have obtained for states and shows that although the quantum correlations of states and are manifested by negativity of the wigner function , for the locally producible states and the quantum correlation can not captured by wigner function .    _ classical states with correlation rank 2. _",

    "local wigner functions of these states are positive and are given by eq . .",
    "moreover , both states have zero quantum correlation and the same classical and total correlations , namely @xmath223 . negativities of these states are different and nonzero ( fig . [ fignegq34]-a )",
    ", however they do not exhibit squeezing and their mandel @xmath0 parameters take the same negative values ( fig . [ fignegq34]-b ) . so that the difference between negativities of these states can not be explained by aforementioned nonclassicalities .",
    "however , a glance at these states show that they are locally equivalent , in the sense that two states change to each other by unitary transformation @xmath224 performed on the one of the subsystems , i.e. @xmath225 . as the amount of quantum correlation as well as classical correlation do not change by local unitary transformations , but the nonclassicality does not possess this property , the difference manifested in fig [ fignegq34]-a may be related to the other nonclassicalities in phase space , such as higher order squeezing @xcite or the photon antibunching @xcite which is , in general , not equivalent to the sub - poissonian distribution @xcite .",

    "_ minimum negativity. _ in the previous example we see that although the states @xmath210 and @xmath211 possess different negativity of the wigner function , this difference does manifested neither as a phase space nonclassicality nor as a quantum correlation .",
    "however , as we mentioned previously these states are locally equivalent .",
    "this implies that performing any local unitary operations on these states do not influence the amount of quantum correlation , but can change the negativity of the wigner function .",
    "therefore we are looking for a local unitary operation that brings local subsystems to classical and , at the same time , reduces the amount of the negativity of the wigner function of the state as much as possible @xcite . by definition",

    "accordingly , we define the following quantity as the minimum negativity of the state @xmath226 here minimum is taken over all local unitary operations that bring the subsystems to classical , i.e. the subsystems attain positive wigner functions . using the above definition , it is clear that for the locally equivalent states @xmath210 and @xmath211 we have @xmath227 .",
    "we have considered two locally equivalent , but globally different , two - mode separable states @xmath45 , @xmath46 and analyzed the nonclassicality of theses states .",
    "it is shown that in spite of the posivity of the wigner functions of the subsystems and equality of the global nonclassicality futures such as mandel @xmath0 parameter and quadrature squeezing , the negativity of the global wigner functions for these states are different . more investigation",
    "have reveled that quantum correlation is responsible for the difference manifested by the negativity of the wigner function .",
    "indeed , it is shown that negativity of the wigner function , non - gaussianity , quantum discord , and lqu of the state @xmath45 are larger than the corresponding quantities of the state @xmath46 , but the geometric discord of both states are the same .",
    "we have also investigated the role of rank criterion and found that when the quantum correlated states can be produced locally from classically correlated states , classical correlation , instead of quantum correlation , can be responsible for the difference between negativity of the wigner function of two states .",
    "moreover , we have also introduced two another pairs of states , denoting by @xmath228 and @xmath229 , with the goal that the first pair has nonzero quantum correlation but their quantum correlation can be produced by local channels , and the second pair exhibits no quantum correlation at all .",
    "more precisely , we have introduced a local channel @xmath208 in such a way that we can prepare the former pair from the second one .",
    "we found that for the first pair , the wigner functions of both states are positive and the states possess the same amount of quantum correlations measured by quantum discord , lqu , and geometric discord . on the other hand for the second pair , which contains two locally unitarily equivalent states with no quantum correlation ,",
    "the wigner functions possess different negativity , although they possess the same amount of negative mandel @xmath0 parameter and no evidence for squeezing . in order to overcome this issue",
    "we have defined minimum negativity of a state which is invariant under local unitary operation .",
