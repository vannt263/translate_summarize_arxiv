    "the self - organized formation of patterns in homogeneous media is a fundamental paradigm in nonlinear science .",
    "recently , a lot of interest has been attracted by self - organized coherence - incoherence patterns in spatially extended oscillator systems , called _ chimera states _  @xcite .",
    "after their first description by kuramoto and battogtokh in a system of coupled phase oscillators , similar dynamical regimes have been reported for a variety of theoretical and experimental settings , including e.g. chemical , electronic and mechanical oscillators  @xcite as well as models of neuronal systems  @xcite . in all of these studies ,",
    "a basic requirement for the observation of chimera states was a sufficiently large number of oscillators of typically at least @xmath0 .",
    "this imposes a substantial restriction on experimental realizations , see  @xcite , and leads to the fact that up to now , with a few exceptions  @xcite , the main tool for theoretical investigations of chimera states has been the continuum limit with the number of oscillators tending to infinity . in this paper",
    ", we will study a slightly modified system , which has been recently presented in  @xcite , where an additional global feedback stabilizes the chimera states in a way such that they can be observed for a smaller number of oscillators .",
    "as in the classical chimera system , we start with  @xmath1 identical kuramoto - sakaguchi phase oscillators of the form @xmath2 with phases @xmath3 and a coupling matrix  @xmath4 . the natural frequencies of the oscillators are all chosen identical , such that without loss of generality we can assume @xmath5 . we consider a one - dimensional array of oscillators , where each oscillator is located at the position @xmath6 in the interval @xmath7 $ ] and which is closed by periodic boundary conditions . then , the coupling constants  @xmath8 can be expressed by a coupling function  @xmath9 , depending on the distances @xmath10 such that the coupling is smaller between more distant oscillators . in this paper",
    "we choose a sinusoidal function , @xmath11\\mbox{,}\\ ] ] as it has been suggested in  @xcite . in order to find a classical chimera state in this system , the phase - lag parameter  @xmath12 in the phase response function ,",
    "governing the attraction and repulsion between the oscillators , has to be well tuned to values slightly below  @xmath13 . however , following  @xcite , we choose the phase lag  @xmath12 not as a constant parameter .",
    "instead , we introduce a global feedback loop @xmath14 between phase lag  @xmath12 and the global order parameter @xmath15 in  @xcite it has been described in detail how this type of global feedback can be interpreted as a proportional control that stabilizes the chimera states . for systems with a large number of oscillators it is non - invasive on average ,",
    "i.e. the branch of equilibrium solutions of the continuum limit remains unchanged , while only its stability properties change .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that for suitably chosen control parameters the completely coherent state loses its stability and for large  @xmath1 the chimera state is the only attractor of the system . the loss of stability of the completely coherent state rules out the main instability mechanism for chimera states with small  @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , as shown in  @xcite chimera states in the classical kuramoto - battogtokh system with nonlocal coupling show sudden collapses to the completely coherent state and can be characterized as chaotic transients with a lifetime that increases exponentially with the system size . due to this effect , it is impossible to observe stable chimera states for small  @xmath1 in the kuramoto - battogtokh system without the feedback term .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to give a detailed description of the dynamical phenomena in the feedback system with a small number of oscillators , using methods of classical finite dimensional chaos and bifurcation theory .",
    "we first present a detailed numerical study of the dynamics displaying a huge variety of regular and irregular stationary and propagating patterns .",
    "then , we give an explanation of the observed phenomena in this system , describing it as a discrete medium at the threshold between stationary excitable and oscillatory behavior , where the pattern formation is caused by an interplay of activation and inhibition due to the nonlocal coupling and the global feedback , which leads to a self - organized spatial modulation of the excitability threshold .     for @xmath16 oscillators with @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( dark spots are phase slips , bright regions have coherent motion ) .",

    "system  ( [ eq:1])([eq:4 ] ) possesses several symmetries .",
    "it is equivariant with respect to phase shifts , i.e. adding a constant to a given solution @xmath25 provides again a solution of the system . in particular",
    ", this leads to the possibility of uniformly rotating periodic solutions of the form @xmath26 so called relative equilibria that turn into equilibria in a corotating coordinate frame .",
    "in addition there can appear relative periodic solutions , i.e. quasiperiodic solutions that turn into periodic solutions in a corotating coordinate frame with a suitably chosen frequency  @xmath27 . moreover , the dihedral group  @xmath28 acting on the indices @xmath29 obviously maps solution to solutions . as we will see below ,",
    "this opens the possibility for relative periodic solutions with different spatio - temporal symmetries , i.e. solutions returning after a period @xmath30 not to the initial state , but to a state related to it by symmetry , i.e. @xmath31 for some group elements @xmath32 .",

    "the phase  @xmath34 of the corresponding oscillator is in anti - phase to its local mean field @xmath35 while in the intervals in between all oscillators are nearly in phase with their local mean field .",

    "we use this observation for the construction of a poincar section in the following way : we record the time moment  @xmath24 of a velocity peak , using the condition that for some oscillator  @xmath39 the function @xmath40 enters into the region above the chosen level @xmath41 .    in our simulations we have chosen @xmath17 and treated  @xmath42 as a bifurcation parameter . note that the feedback term  ( [ eq:3 ] ) provides an attractive coupling only for @xmath43 . in fig .",

    "one can clearly distinguish self - organized regions of coherent oscillation from those regions where velocity peaks are localized .",

    "in contrast , a locally increasing number of velocity peaks ( say , for oscillators  @xmath86 near a given index  @xmath20 ) decreases the local order parameter  @xmath67 in the denominator , increasing  @xmath85 and pushing the oscillator  @xmath20 towards the oscillatory regime .",
    "hence , it acts as a local activation .",
    "this interplay of activation and inhibition in a discrete excitable medium close to threshold explains a mechanism of self - modulated excitability , where in the self - organized region of oscillatory motion the observed variety of regular and irregular patterns can take place .",
    "we have shown that in addition to the well elaborated approach of studying chimera states in the framework of the continuum limit @xmath87 , there is also a way to study their emergence for small  @xmath1 by methods of classical dynamical systems theory .",
    "in particular , we could show that in the feedback system investigated here chaotic chimera states can be found as true chaotic attractors , emerging in well understood transitions such as period doubling cascades , torus breakup , and intermittency .",
    "an increasing global feedback parameter  @xmath42 , pushing the dynamics closer towards the unstable completely coherent state induces a condensation of the irregular chimera states to simple regular patterns composed of localized phase slipping events of single oscillators .",
    "moreover , we could show that discrete excitable media with nonlocal and global coupling can support not only the classical scenario of propagating of excitation waves , but also a pattern formation process leading to self - localized regions of excitation organized by an interplay between short range activation and long range inhibition .",
