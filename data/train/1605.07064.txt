    "experimental results from heavy - ion collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) give strong indications for the occurrence of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the successful description of the qgp , even at early times , by relativistic viscous hydrodynamics suggests a rather fast thermalization within a few fm @xcite . starting from the highly anisotropic scenario of two colliding ultrarelativistic nuclei , it is still an open question which processes are responsible for this fast thermalization .",
    "one candidate are color instabilities @xcite such as the chromo - weibel instability @xcite , which is the analogue of the weibel instability in electromagnetic plasmas @xcite .    in the limit of weak coupling , which is assumed for the present energy scales at lhc and rhic ,",
    "the two nuclei can be described in the color glass condensate ( cgc ) framework @xcite .",
    "it provides an expansion of inclusive quantities , such as the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath2 , in powers of the strong coupling @xmath3 , where the leading order is obtained by solving the yang - mills equations .",
    "we want to approach this problem from first principles by applying real - time lattice qcd techniques , approximating qcd by yang - mills theory in the classical limit .",
    "the classical approximation is justified by the high occupation of gluons in the non - equilibrium medium produced after the heavy - ion collision .",
    "in contrast to other works using bjorken ( expanding ) coordinates @xcite , our exploratory studies focus on finite , static box simulations .",
    "the classical yang - mills equations for the gauge fields and their conjugate momenta can be solved using the framework of lattice gauge theory @xcite , where the continuum gauge fields @xmath4 are represented in terms of lattice gauge fields @xmath5 .",
    "we follow the mclerran - venugopalan model @xcite to construct the initial conditions for the lattice gauge fields @xmath6 and the chromo - electric fields @xmath7 within the cgc framework .",
    "we set the longitudinal component of the collective gauge field @xmath8 and construct the transverse components by merging the color fields from the two colliding nuclei , denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , by solving @xcite @xmath11 \\right\\ } = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for given @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with @xmath12 the generators of @xmath1 .    to get the color fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 , one solves the poisson equation @xmath13 for nuclear color sources with the following gaussian distribution : @xmath14    the color fields",
    "are then constructed from the obtained `` color potentials '' @xmath15 via @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the transverse chromo - electric fields are set to zero and the longitudinal part is constructed out of the gauge fields @xmath6 via    @xmath19\\big[u_i^{(2)\\dagger}(x ) - u_i^{(1)\\dagger}(x)\\big ] - \\text{h.c.}\\\\ & \\hspace{0.45 cm } + \\big[u_i^\\dagger(x-\\hat{\\imath } ) - 1\\big]\\big[u_i^{(2)\\dagger}(x-\\hat{\\imath } ) - u_i^{(1)\\dagger}(x-\\hat{\\imath})\\big ] - \\text{h.c . }",

    "this is done by a small random variation of the idealized @xmath20-function - like distribution of the initial chromo - electric fields . to this end , we add a fluctuation term @xmath21 .",
    "we will discuss the effect of the seed @xmath22 in .",
    "to study the thermalization time , we observe the ratio of the longitudinal to the transverse pressure @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the pressure components are related to the spatial diagonal elements of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath24 @xcite and the chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic longitudinal and transverse energy densities as : @xmath25 = \\epsilon_{e_l}(t ) + \\epsilon_{b_l}(t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the lattice expressions for the components of the chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic energy densities @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , are    @xmath28\\\\ h^e_i(t , x ) & = \\frac{1}{g^2 } \\text{re}\\text{tr } \\big [ e_i(x)e_i(x ) \\big ] \\label{eq : hei}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from which we get the energy densities @xmath29 by averaging over the transverse lattice plane @xmath30 or the longitudinal axis @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "our results are based on calculations on a @xmath32-lattice averaged over 30 independent measurements .",
    "we set the coupling constant @xmath33 and fix @xmath34 in accordance with the literature and conforming to the expectations of rhic physics @xcite .    the value for the seed @xmath22 , which controls the fluctuations , is purely artificial .",
    "the higher it is , the faster the system thermalizes , but there is an upper bound : since @xmath22 only enters the electric part of the initial energy density , we have to monitor its influence on the initial total energy density , which should not significantly change , otherwise the classical approximation is no longer tenable . in our setup",
    "we chose @xmath35 , which leads to a change of the initial value of the total energy density , which stays constant during the simulation , by less than @xmath36 ( cf .",

    "we are especially interested in the so - called hydrodynamization time , which is the time where hydrodynamic models should start to be applicable .",
    "( right ) shows the value of the pressure ratio , which slowly approaches the hydrodynamization level , which is commonly set to @xmath41 .",
    "shows the energy density @xmath42 ( cf . ) in the @xmath43-plane , where we averaged over the @xmath44-direction .",
    "since we are only interested in the qualitative structure , we performed only one measurement here .",
    "this explains the vertical lines , which are a result of the initial fluctuations .    at @xmath45 ,",
    "two filaments start emerging , which are clearly visible at @xmath46 .",
    "later , at @xmath47 the filamentous structure is almost completely dissolved , which suggests an imminent thermalization .",
    "this characteristic filamentation is a strong indication for the presence of a chromo - weibel instability .     averaged over the @xmath44-direction is plotted in the @xmath43-plane for different times .",
