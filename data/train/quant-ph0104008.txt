    "it is a well - known fact that given a single copy of a quantum system it is in general impossible to determine its quantum state exactly @xcite .",
    "this principle is closely related to the no - cloning theorem @xcite , which prevents one from producing multiple faithful copies from a single unknown state .",
    "of course , the situation becomes different when one is given an ensemble of identically prepared quantum systems . with the increasing size of such an ensemble",
    "one can extract more and more precise information on its preparation @xcite .",
    "an important effect which usually accompanies an attempt to determine the unknown preparation of a quantum system is the disturbance of its original state .",
    "the state disturbance is a penalty for gaining classical information from a quantum system .",
    "this fundamental feature of quantum mechanics has been discussed from many different points of view , depending on the particular physical scenario considered @xcite .",
    "a recent paper @xcite presented the description of the trade - off between the information gain and the quantum state disturbance motivated by the problem of quantum state estimation @xcite . in this approach , the classical outcome gained from an operation on the quantum system is converted into a guess what the original state was . according to the general quantum mechanical rule linking the information gain with the state disturbance",
    ", the better guess can be made on average , the less the final state of the system should resemble the initial one .",
    "natural parameters for quantifying the trade - off in this context are mean fidelities , defined using the scalar product between the relevant state vectors , and averaged over many realizations of the scenario .",
    "the first quantity of interest is the operation fidelity @xmath0 , which parameterizes the average resemblance of the state of the system after the operation to the original one .",
    "the second quantity , known as the estimation fidelity @xmath1 , tells us how good estimate one can provide on the basis of the classical outcome of a given operation . in the plane of the fidelities @xmath0 and @xmath1 , quantum mechanics imposes a bound in the form of a trade - off curve limiting the maximum values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 that can be achieved simultaneously for any quantum operation . for a single copy of a @xmath2-level system , the trade - off curve between @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be described in simple analytical terms @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a more general case of the fidelity trade - off , when one is given a finite ensemble of identically prepared systems .",
    "we shall assume that these systems are qubits prepared in an arbitrary , randomly selected , pure state .",
    "of course , the penalty  i.e.  the state disturbance  for gaining information is expected to be smaller for an ensemble compared to the single system case . in the limit of an infinite number of copies",
    ", we can determine the quantum state exactly and reset the state of all the qubits according to this precisely known information .",
    "then in principle no disturbance needs to occur .",
    "our interest here will be focused on the intermediate case between the single - copy operations and nearly perfect estimation of large ensembles .",
    "we shall discuss the trade - off curve between the operation fidelity and the estimation fidelity in the most general case when the ensemble consists of a finite number @xmath3 of qubits .",
    "the two fidelities used in our work have fundamentally different practical meanings . informally speaking , the operation fidelity @xmath0 deals with the intrinsic quantum information remaining in the state of a quantum system .",
    "in contrast , the estimation fidelity @xmath1 describes the classical information gained from the measurement .",
    "this classical information allows us , for example , to generate arbitrarily many copies of the initial state with the same fidelity @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , for finite ensembles the fidelities @xmath0 and @xmath1 take values from different ranges .",
    "for example @xmath0 can easily be equal to one for any size of the ensemble ( which simply means that nothing is done to the qubits ) but in contrast @xmath4 means that we are able to generate arbitrarily many perfect copies using the result of the estimation .",
    "previous work on quantum state estimation @xcite demonstrated that the maximum attainable estimation fidelity for an ensemble consisting of @xmath3 qubits is @xmath5 . as we justify later , this is also the value for the operation fidelity in the limit of optimal quantum state estimation .",
    "of interest here is what happens below this value for @xmath1 and above this value for @xmath0 , as this describes the region where we try to convert part of the the quantum information contained in the initial state into a classical guess .    finding the trade - off curve for an ensemble of @xmath3 qubits presents in principle a rather complicated problem .",
    "a general quantum operation can map the initial state of the qubits onto the full hilbert space with the dimensionality @xmath6 , which grows exponentially with the size of the ensemble .",
    "furthermore , the classical operation outcomes used for the estimation can a priori assume values from an arbitrarily large set .",
    "in this paper we demonstrate in several steps that it is possible to reduce the general problem of finding the trade - off curve to @xmath7 independent constrained optimization problems , each involving @xmath8 real variables .",
    "the reduced optimization problems have quadratic form , and they can be solved numerically by finding the eigenvectors of certain tridiagonal matrices .",
    "this is a substantial reduction of the complexity of the problem compared to its original formulation , which allows us to deal numerically with much larger ensembles .",
    "furthermore , numerical evidence strongly suggests that in general just one from @xmath9 optimization problems gives the full trade - off curve , but a strict mathematical proof of this conjecture is lacking .",
    "most importantly , we achieve the reduction of the complexity without imposing any restrictions on the generality of quantum operations considered , and the calculated trade - off curves are both tight and universal .",
    "the results of our paper are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] , where we depict the trade - off curves calculated using our approach for several exemplary values of @xmath3 .",
    "all the curves have a common extreme point attained for @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this point is reached when the ensemble is simply left intact , and the corresponding value for the estimation fidelity @xmath11 describes making a completely random guess about the state of the qubits .",
    "the other extreme point for each trade - off curve , corresponding to optimal quantum state estimation , is given by @xmath12 . in this limit , the fidelity of the qubits remaining after the operation is exactly the same as the fidelity of our guess . one can give a simple intuitive argument that this should be the case : @xmath0 is always an upper bound on @xmath1 , since one can always set the state of the qubits equal to the guess state .",
    "it is plausible that this bound can be achieved in the limit where we only care about maximizing @xmath1 . between the two extreme points ,",
    "the depicted trade - off curves illustrate how with increasing @xmath3 the extraction of classical information has less of an effect on the state of the qubits after the operation .",
    "the problem considered in this paper can be viewed as a special case of quantum cloning , i.e.  generating a larger number of imperfect copies from a given ensemble @xcite .",
    "as we noted , given a classical estimate of the quantum state , we can use it to generate an infinite number of qubits with the same fidelity as the estimate @xcite .",
    "thus , the trade - off curves presented in this paper describe the optimal performance of an asymmetric quantum copying machine which given @xmath3 identical pure qubits produces @xmath3 clones with the fidelity @xmath0 , and in addition arbitrarily many clones with the fidelity @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in sec .  [ sec : formulation ] , we formulate the problem of the fidelity trade - off in quantitative terms . in sec .  [",
    "sec : fidelities ] we simplify the formulae for the fidelities using the angular momentum representation of the rotation group .",
    "this provides explicit expressions for the fidelities that are suitable for further calculations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : decomposition ] we argue that in order to find the trade - off curve it suffices to consider a single quantum operation element , thus substantially reducing the complexity of the problem .",
    "we further demonstrate in sec .",
    "[ sec : fullysym ] that it is sufficient to consider operations which map the initial state of the qubits only onto the fully symmetric subspace . with these results in hand",
    ", we define in sec .",
    "[ sec : optimization ] the reduced optimization problem which yields the actual trade - off curve .",
    "the numerical solution to this problem is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] .",
    "next , we show in sec .  [",
    "sec : attainability ] that the calculated trade - off curves are achievable , by constructing explicit quantum operations attaining the derived bound .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we begin with an ensemble of @xmath3 qubits all prepared in the same pure state @xmath13 .",
    "we shall use the following notation : @xmath14 i.e.  the state @xmath13 is represented as a result of a unitary operation @xmath15 on a reference state @xmath16 , which we will take for concreteness to be the spin up state along the @xmath17 axis , @xmath18 .",
    "the group of the unitary transformations @xmath15 can be conveniently parameterized using the two - dimensional irreducible representation of the rotation group .",
    "thus @xmath19 can be considered as an abbreviation for the triplet of the euler angles @xmath20 , and @xmath21 the third euler angle @xmath22 introduces a trivial overall phase factor in the definition of the states @xmath13 and in principle it could be set to zero",

    "we assume that the qubits are submitted to an action of a certain quantum operation , which can in general act collectively on the whole ensemble .",
    "such an operation is described by a set of operators @xmath25 acting in the @xmath6-dimensional tensor product hilbert space of all the qubits @xcite .",
    "the classical outcome of the operation is given by the index @xmath26 , and it is correlated with the final quantum state of the qubits .",

    "the operation fidelity @xmath0 quantifies the average resemblance of the state after the operation to the original one .",

    "this quantity , summed over the possible outcomes @xmath26 of the operation with the corresponding weights @xmath36 and averaged over the initial state of the qubits , yields the mean operation fidelity for an ensemble of identically prepared qubits : latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : fdef } f = \\int d\\omega \\sum_{r } p_r ( \\omega ) \\langle \\omega | \\hat{\\varrho}^{\\text{red}}_{r } ( \\omega )     the second quantity of interest is the estimation fidelity @xmath1 .",
    "given the classical outcome @xmath26 of the operation , we can make a guess @xmath38 what the original state of the qubits was .",
    "a natural way to quantify the quality of the guess is to take the squared absolute value of the scalar product between the guess and the original state , equal to @xmath39 .",
    "the estimation fidelity is obtained by averaging this expression over the sets of possible operation outcomes @xmath26 and the input states @xmath13 : @xmath40 itself , but also on the estimation rule used to make the guess , described by the mapping @xmath41 .",
    "we will demonstrate in the following how to define this mapping in a way which optimizes the estimation fidelity for a given arbitrary quantum operation .",
