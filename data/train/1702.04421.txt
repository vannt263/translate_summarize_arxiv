    "the last section of @xcite computes the probability that the attackers catch up .",
    "following nakamoto , by `` success of the attackers ''",
    "we mean catching up the @xmath2 blocks , although to replace the blocks the attackers need to validate @xmath4 .",

    "after @xmath2 blocks have been validated by the honest miners , the probability of success of the attackers is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the regularized incomplete beta function @xmath9    we carry out a more accurate risk analysis by considering not only the number of confirmations @xmath2 but also the time @xmath3 it took for the last @xmath2 validated blocks , which is an information that is clearly available .    in practice , in order to avoid a double spend attack , the recipient of the bitcoin transaction waits for @xmath10 confirmations .",
    "he also has the information on the time @xmath3 it took to confirm the transaction @xmath2 times .",
    "obviously the probability of success of the attackers increases with @xmath3 since he has more time to secretly mine his alternative blockchain . in @xcite",
    "we carry out a more precise risk analysis considering this available data .",
    "the relevant dimensionless parameter introduced is the relative deviation from the expected time @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the expected validation time of a new block ( @xmath13 for the bitcoin network ) . in @xcite",
    "we give a closed - form formula for the probability @xmath14 that the attackers catch up with the current chain .",

    "we tabulate these probabilities for @xmath18 .",
    "the tables are useful to determine the number of confirmations needed for a given transaction . in practice , someone receiving a bitcoin transaction will check after @xmath2 confirmations the corresponding table . with the measured time @xmath3 , he will compute @xmath16 , and check the value of @xmath19 and then asses the level of risk assumed accepting the payment .",
