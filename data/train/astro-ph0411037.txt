    "recent investigations of the large scale distribution of galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) have revealed a complex relationship between the properties of galaxies , ( such as color , luminosity , surface brightness , and concentration ) and their environments ( @xcite ) .",
    "these and other investigations using the sdss ( @xcite ) and the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( @xcite ) have found that galaxy clustering is a function both of star formation history and of luminosity . for low luminosity galaxies , clustering is a strong function of color , while for luminous galaxies clustering is a strong function of luminosity . for red galaxies ,",
    "clustering is a non - monotonic function of luminosity , peaking at both high and low luminosities . although galaxy clustering correlates also with surface brightness and concentration , @xcite and @xcite show that galaxy environment is independent of these properties at fixed color and luminosity .",
    "thus , color and luminosity  measures of star formation history  appear to have a more fundamental relationship with environment than do surface brightness and concentration  measures of the distribution of stars within the galaxy .",
    "some of the investigations above have explored the scale dependence of these relationships .",
    "studies of the correlation function , such as @xcite and @xcite , can address this question , but do not address directly whether the density on large scales is related to galaxy properties _ independent _ of the relationships with density on small scales .",
    "if only the _ masses _ of the host halos of galaxies strongly affect their properties , then we expect no such independent relationship between galaxy properties and the large scale density field .",
    "thus , it is important to examine this issue in order to test the assumptions of the `` halo model '' description of galaxy formation and of semi - analytic models that depend only on the properties of the host halo ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "recent studies of this question have come to conflicting conclusions .",
    "for example , @xcite have concluded from their analysis of sdss and 2dfgrs galaxies that the equivalent width of h@xmath4 is a function of environment measured on scales of 1.1 @xmath2 mpc and 5.5 @xmath2 mpc independently of each other . on the other hand , @xcite find that at fixed density at scales of 1 @xmath2 mpc , the distribution of d4000 ( a measure of the age of the stellar population ) is not a strong function of density on larger scales .",
    "here we address the dependence on scale of the relative bias of sdss galaxies .",
    "section [ data ] describes our data set .",
    "section [ results ] explores how the relationship between the color , luminosity , and environments of galaxies depends on scale .",
    "section [ bluefrac ] resolves the discrepancy noted in the previous paragraph between @xcite and @xcite , finding that only small scales are important to the recent star formation history of galaxies .",
    "section [ summary ] summarizes the results .    where necessary",
    ", we have assumed cosmological parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "the sdss is taking @xmath10 ccd imaging of @xmath11 of the northern galactic sky , and , from that imaging , selecting @xmath12 targets for spectroscopy , most of them galaxies with @xmath13 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "automated software performs all of the data processing : astrometry @xcite ; source identification , deblending and photometry @xcite ; photometricity determination @xcite ; calibration @xcite ; spectroscopic target selection @xcite ; spectroscopic fiber placement @xcite ; and spectroscopic data reduction .",
    "an automated pipeline called idlspec2d measures the redshifts and classifies the reduced spectra ( schlegel et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the spectroscopy has small incompletenesses coming primarily from ( 1 ) galaxies missed because of mechanical spectrograph constraints ( 6  percent ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which leads to a slight under - representation of high - density regions , and ( 2 ) spectra in which the redshift is either incorrect or impossible to determine ( @xmath14  percent ) .",
    "in addition , there are some galaxies ( @xmath15  percent ) blotted out by bright galactic stars , but this incompleteness should be uncorrelated with galaxy properties .      for the purposes of computing large - scale structure and galaxy property statistics , we have assembled a subsample of sdss galaxies known as the nyu value added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc ; @xcite ) .",
    "one of the products of that catalog is a low redshift catalog .",
    "here we use the version of that catalog corresponding to the sdss data release 2 ( dr2 ) .",
    "the low redshift catalog has a number of important features which are useful in the study of low luminosity galaxies .",
    "most importantly :    1 .",
    "we have checked by eye all of the images and spectra of low luminosity ( @xmath16 ) or low redshift ( @xmath17 ) galaxies in the nyu - vagc .",
    "most significantly , we have trimmed those which are `` flecks '' incorrectly deblended out of bright galaxies ; for some of these cases , we have been able to replace the photometric measurements with the measurements of the parents . for a full description of our checks ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "2 .   for galaxies which were shredded in the target version of the deblending ,",
    "the spectra are often many arcseconds away from the nominal centers of the galaxy in the latest version of the photometric reductions .",
    "we have used the new version of the deblending to decide whether these ( otherwise non - matched spectra ) should be associated with the galaxy in the best version .",
    "we have estimated the distance to low redshift objects using the @xcite model of the local velocity field ( using @xmath18 ) , and propagated the uncertainties in distance into uncertainties in absolute magnitude .    for the purposes of our analysis below , we have matched this sample to the results of @xcite , who measured emission line fluxs and equivalent widths for all of the sdss spectra .",
    "below , we use their results for the h@xmath4 equivalent width .",
    "the range of distances we include is @xmath19 @xmath2 mpc , making the sample volume limited for galaxies with @xmath20 .",
    "the total completeness - weighted effective area of the sample , excluding areas close to tycho stars , is 2220.9 square degrees .",
    "the catalog contains 28,089 galaxies . @xcite",
    "have investigated the luminosity function , surface brightness selection effects , and galaxy properties in this sample .",
    "we will be studying the environments of galaxies as a function of their luminosity and color below . to give a sense of the morphological properties of galaxies with various luminosities and colors , figure [ color_mag ]",
    "shows galaxies randomly selected in bins of color and luminosity . each image is 40 @xmath2 kpc on a side .",
    "red , high luminosity galaxies are classic giant ellipticals .",
    "lower luminosity red galaxies tend to be more flattened and less concentrated .",
    "blue , high luminosity galaxies have well - defined spiral structure and dust lanes .",
    "lower luminosity blue galaxies have less well - defined bulges and fewer spiral features .      in order to evaluate the environments of galaxies in our sample , we perform the following procedure .    first , for each given galaxy in the sample , we count the number of other galaxies @xmath21 with @xmath22 outside a projected radius of 10 @xmath2 kpc and within some outer radius @xmath23 , which we will vary below , and within @xmath24 km s@xmath8 in the redshift direction .",
    "this trace catalog is volume - limited within @xmath25 . in order to make a more direct comparison to @xcite",
    ", we will also use a trace catalog containing only galaxies with @xmath26 .",
    "second , we calculate the mean expected number of galaxies in that volume as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the sampling fraction of galaxies in the right ascension ( @xmath4 ) and declination ( @xmath29 ) direction of each point within the volume .",
    "we perform this integral using a monte carlo approach , distributing random points inside the volume with a density modulated by the sampling fraction @xmath28 .    in order to calculate the mean density around galaxies in various classes",
    ", we will simply calculate : @xmath30 as the density with respect to the mean .",
    "when one calculates the mean density around galaxies , it is necessary to have a fair sample of the universe . for the most luminous galaxies in our sample ( @xmath31 ) the sample is volume - limited out to our redshift limit of @xmath32 and constitutes the equivalent of a 60 @xmath2 mpc radius sphere , which constitutes a fair sample for many purposes ( @xmath33cdm predicts a variance in such a sphere to be about 0.13 ) .",
    "however , the lower luminosity galaxies can only be seen in the fraction of this volume which is nearby , and below a certain luminosity the sample is no longer fair .",
    "for example , consider figure [ check_rho_converge ] , which shows the cumulative mean density around galaxies with @xmath34 in spheres of larger and larger radius around the milky way .",
    "the mean overdensity does not converge until a volume which corresponds to approximately @xmath35 .",
    "thus , it is not really safe to evaluate the mean density around galaxies that are too low luminosity to be observed out that far in redshift , which is to say , less luminous than @xmath36 .    however , for the moment let us consider figure [ biden_all ] .",
    "the greyscale and contours show the mean density relative to the mean as a function of color and luminosity , using a projected radius of @xmath37 @xmath2 mpc .",
    "the mean is calculated in a sliding box with the width shown .",
    "if the sliding box contains fewer than 20 galaxies , the result is ignored and colored pure white . here",
    "we show the results for the entire sample .",
    "our statistical uncertainties are well - behaved down to about @xmath38 , but we are likely to be cosmic variance limited for @xmath39 , as indicated by the solid vertical line .",
    "thus , the apparent decline in the mean overdensity for red galaxies lower luminosity than @xmath40 is probably spurious . despite that limitation ,",
    "we note that there is a strong relationship between environment and color even at @xmath41 .",
    "we note in passing that we can still use the variation of the density within @xmath42 to study the properties of galaxies as a function of density down to low luminosity .",
    "just because the _ mean _ density of galaxies in that volume has not converged does _ not _ imply that there is insufficient variation of density to study the variation of galaxy properties with environment .    for our fair sample of galaxies with @xmath43 ,",
    "figure [ biden_scales ] shows the dependence of overdensity on luminosity and color for six different projected radii : 0.2 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 @xmath2 mpc .",
    "we only show results for @xmath44 , for which we have a fair sample .",
    "obviously , the density contrast decreases with scale ; on the other hand , the qualitative form of the plot does not change .",
    "our results remain similar to those shown in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results here demonstrate that the environments of low luminosity , red galaxies do continue to become denser as absolute magnitude increases down to absolute magnitudes of @xmath45 ( about two magnitudes less luminous than explored by our previous work ) .",
    "figure [ biden_ratios ] shows the ratio of the overdensity @xmath29 at each scale relative to that at the largest scale of @xmath46 @xmath2 mpc . this ratio is a measure of the steepness of the cross - correlation between galaxies of a given color and absolute magnitude with _ all _ galaxies in our volume - limited sample ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "interestingly , the contours in steepness are qualitatively similar to the contours in overdensity in figure [ biden_scales ] .",
    "this similarity implies that for each class of galaxy , the strength of the correlation on large scales always is associated with a _ steeper _ correlation function .",
    "another way of looking at similar results is to ask , as a function of environment , what fraction of galaxies are blue .",
    "we split the sample into `` red '' and `` blue '' galaxies using the following , luminosity - dependent cut : @xmath48 blue galaxies thus have @xmath49 .",
    "we then sort all the galaxies with @xmath50 into bins of density on three different scales : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 @xmath2 mpc . in each bin",
    "we calculate the fraction of blue galaxies .",
    "figure [ lowz_fracblue ] shows this blue fraction as a function of density . in all cases , the blue fraction declines as a function of density , as one would expect based on figure [ biden_scales ] above , and from the astronomical literature ( a highly abridged list of relevant work would include @xcite ) .",
    "if we divide the sample into bins of luminosity , we find that higher luminosities have smaller blue fractions ( of course ) but that the dependence of blue fraction on density does not change .",
    "the question naturally arises : _ which _ scales are important to the process of galaxy formation ?",
    "is the local environment within 0.5 @xmath2 mpc the only important consideration ? or is the larger scale environment also important ?",
    "for example , consider figure [ denvden ] , which shows the conditional dependence of the three density estimators at the three scales on each other . the diagonal plots simply show the distribution within our sample of each density estimator .",
    "the off - diagonal plots show the conditional distribution of the quantity on the @xmath54-axis given the quantity on the @xmath55-axis . as an example",
    ", the lower right panel shows @xmath56 shows the fraction of blue galaxies as a function of two density estimates : one with @xmath51 @xmath2 mpc and one with @xmath57 @xmath2 mpc . in this case",
    "it is clear that the blue fraction is a function of both densities .",
    "that is , even at a fixed density on scales of @xmath37 @xmath2 mpc , the density outside that radius matters to the blue fraction ; in addition , at a fixed density on scales of @xmath52 @xmath2 mpc , the distribution of galaxies within that radius appears to affect the blue fraction as well .    on the other hand ,",
    "consider figure [ lowz_fracblue2_1.0 - 6.0 ] , which is the same as figure [ lowz_fracblue2_0.5 - 1.0 ] , but now showing the densities at scales of @xmath57 and @xmath53 @xmath2 mpc . in figure",
    "[ lowz_fracblue2_1.0 - 6.0 ] the contours are vertical , indicating that the density between @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xmath2 mpc has very little effect on galaxy properties . at a fixed value of the density at the smaller scale ,",
    "the larger scale environment appears to be of little importance .",
    "@xcite found that these contours were not vertical when he looked at the fraction of galaxies for which the h@xmath4 equivalent width was @xmath58  .",
    "their result appears in conflict with that of the previous paragraph .",
    "on the other hand , the emission lines measure a more recent star formation rate than does the color ; it is possible in principle that the more recent star formation rate depends more strongly on large - scale environment . to rule out this possibility ,",
    "figure [ lowz_frachalpha2_1.0 - 6.0 ] shows the same result as figure [ lowz_fracblue2_1.0 - 6.0 ] , but now showing the fraction of galaxies with h@xmath4 equivalent widths ( as measured by @xcite ) greater than 4  .",
    "again , for strong emission line fraction as for the blue fraction , the smaller scales are important , but the 6 @xmath2 mpc scales are not , in contradiction with @xcite .",
    "why , then , did @xcite conclude that large scales _ were _ important ?",
    "there are a number of differences between our study and theirs .",
    "first , their contouring method differs ; instead of measuring the blue fraction in bins of fixed size , at each point they measure the star - forming fraction among the nearest 500 galaxies in the plane of @xmath59 and @xmath60 . we have found that this procedure creates a _ slight _ bias in the contouring in the sense that near the edges of the distribution vertical contours will become diagonal .",
    "however , this effect is not strong enough to explain the differences between our results and those of @xcite .",
    "second , to estimate the density in their sample they used a spherical gaussian filter , whereas here we use the overdensity in cones .",
    "we have not investigated what effect this difference has .",
    "finally , they use tracer galaxies with a considerably lower mean density than ours .",
    "their effective absolute magnitude limit is @xmath61 ; such galaxies have a mean density of @xmath62 @xmath63 mpc@xmath64 .",
    "our tracers ( @xmath22 ) have a mean density of @xmath65 @xmath63 mpc@xmath64 , almost six times higher .",
    "figure [ lowz_frachalpha2_m-20.5_1.0 - 6.0 ] shows our results when we restrict our tracer sample to @xmath61 .",
    "the contours in this figure are very diagonal , similar to the results of @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that one of two possible mechanisms are causing the differences between our results and those of @xcite .",
    "first , the higher luminosity galaxies with @xmath61 might be yielding fundamentally different information about the density field than our lower luminosity tracers .",
    "second , the lower mean density of the galaxies with @xmath61 might be effectively introducing `` noise '' in the measurement on small scales .",
    "remember that the large scale and small scale densities are intrinsically correlated .",
    "so if the small scale measurement is noisy enough , the higher signal - to - noise ratio large scale measurement could actually be adding extra information about the environment on _ small _ scales .",
    "such an effect would make the contours in figure [ lowz_frachalpha2_m-20.5_1.0 - 6.0 ] diagonal .",
    "we have performed a simple test to distinguish these possibilities , which is to remake figure [ lowz_frachalpha2_1.0 - 6.0 ] using the low luminosity tracers ( @xmath66 ) but subsampling them to the same mean density as the high luminosity tracers ( @xmath67 ) . this test yields diagonal contours , meaning one can understand the diagonal contours of figure [ lowz_frachalpha2_m-20.5_1.0 - 6.0 ] and of @xcite as simply reflecting the low signal - to - noise ratio of the density estimates .",
    "we explore the relative bias between galaxies as a function of scale , finding the following .    1 .   the dependence of mean environment on color persists to the lowest luminosities we explore ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "red , low luminosity galaxies tend to be in overdense regions , down at least to @xmath69 .",
    "this result extends those found by @xcite and @xcite towards lower luminosities by about 2 magnitudes .",
    "3 .   at any given point of color and luminosity , a correlation function with a stronger amplitude implies correlation function with a steeper slope .",
    "4 .   in regions of a given overdensity on small scales ( @xmath70 @xmath2 mpc ) , the overdensity on large scales ( @xmath46 @xmath2 mpc ) does not appear to relate to the recent star formation history of the galaxies .",
    "the last point above deserves elaboration .",
    "first , it contradicts the results of @xcite .",
    "we have found that their results are probably due to the low mean density of the tracers they used .",
    "this explanation underscores the importance of taking care when using low signal - to - noise quantities .",
    "galaxy environments are difficult to measure , in the sense we use tracers that do not necessarily trace the `` environment '' perfectly , meaning neither with low noise nor necessarily in an unbiased manner .",
    "we claim here that our higher density of tracers marks an improvement over previous work , but it is worth noting the limitations of assuming that the local galaxy density fairly and adequately represents whatever elements of the environment affect galaxy formation .",
    "second , if the galaxy density field is an adequate representation of the environment , the result has important implications regarding the physics of galaxy formation . in simulations",
    "whose initial conditions are constrained by cosmic microwave background observations and galaxy large - scale structure observations , virialized dark matter halos do not extend to sizes much larger than @xmath71@xmath72 @xmath2 mpc .",
    "thus , our results are consistent with the notion that only the masses of the host halos of the galaxies we observe are strongly affecting the star formation of the galaxies .",
    "in addition , @xcite find that only the star formation histories , not the azimuthally - averaged structural parameters , are directly related to environment .",
    "for these reasons , it is likely that we can understand the process of galaxy formation by only considering the properties of the host dark matter halos .",
    "our results therefore encourage the `` halo model '' description of galaxy formation and the pursuit of semi - analytic models which depend only on the properties of the host halo ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
