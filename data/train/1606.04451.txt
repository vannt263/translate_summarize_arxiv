    "for metallic transport to occur in arrays of spherical ncs that touch each other at transport limiting facets , the ncs themselves need to be metallic , i.e. the number of electrons @xmath21 in a nc is large .",
    "hence , the electron gas can be described with the fermi wave vector :    @xmath22    here @xmath23 is the density of electrons in a nc .",
    "below , @xmath24 serves as a measure of the concentration @xmath19 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we show that if @xmath25 the nc has random energy spectrum filled upto @xmath26 due to random potential of donors . in the opposite quantum - confined case , @xmath27 , for spherically symmetric ncs",
    ", electrons occupy states with different radial and angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath28-shells , each of them being degenerate with respect of azimuthal quantum number @xmath29 . if the total number of electrons in the nc is @xmath30 , several @xmath28-shells are occupied .",
    "still , when quantum numbers are large , bohr s correspondence principle allows us to consider the average density of states of electrons quasiclassically and introduce the fermi wave vector @xmath24 and the fermi energy @xmath31 .",
    "this description is correct if the fermi energy @xmath31 is a good estimate for the energy of the top shell . at the critical concentration @xmath32 for cdse ncs with diameter @xmath33 ,",
    "each nc has 13 electrons and the top shell is the half - filled 1d - shell .",
    "the fermi energy @xmath31 at the concentration @xmath0 is 50% smaller than the shell energy @xmath34 .",
    "hence , our degenerate gas description is accurate within 50% , which is a measure for the accuracy of our @xmath0 predictions .    to derive the mit condition",
    ", we consider the conductance of two metallic nc connected by a small facet contact .",
    "when @xmath35 , the conductance of such a `` point '' contact was previously studied quasiclassically  @xcite :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the contact area .",
    "this conductance can be easily understood with the help of the landauer formula @xcite .",
    "the number of conducting channels in the contact area is @xmath38 and each of them additively contributes @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "it was proven that the mit occurs if the average conductance between two neighboring ncs @xmath40 in an array of ncs is equal to the minimal conductance @xmath41 @xcite :    @xmath42    substituting @xmath40 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sharvin_2 ] ) into ( [ eq : minimal_g ] ) yields the general criterion for the mit    @xmath43    which can easily be rewritten in terms of @xmath0 with help of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fermi_wave ] ) to yield eq .",
    "( [ eq : result ] ) .",
    "the origin of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mit_final ] ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sheme ] : the condition @xmath44 describes electron wave packets with a size small enough to pass through the contact facet .",
    "we now discuss the effect of the contact facet size , which for metal chalcogenide ncs can be large @xcite .",
    "considering as an example an octahedron - shaped particle that is circumscribed by a sphere of diameter @xmath12 , the area of each facet is @xmath45 . equating this to @xmath46 , we find an effective @xmath47 at @xmath48 , we get @xmath49 , which is not far from @xmath50 for the spherical case . this @xmath51 results in a 3 times smaller @xmath0 than @xmath52 .",
    "the nc contact through facets is , of course , the best case scenario that defines the lower bound for @xmath0 for spherical ncs . for ncs that do not touch through facets , a finite tunneling distance @xmath53 in the medium between ncs",
    "should be taken into account . here",
    "@xmath54 is the work function .",
    "an electron can move between neighboring ncs only in a disc that we call @xmath55-contact , in which the distance between ncs is smaller than @xmath55 .",
    "the radius of such a @xmath55-contact is @xmath56 ( see si1 [ sec : b_contact ] )",
    ". the small ratio of the effective electron mass in the semiconductor nc to the free electron mass makes the @xmath55-contact transparent ( see similar effect in ref . ) .",
    "usually , for ncs in vacuum ( air ) , @xmath57 which is much smaller than the lattice constant @xmath11 ; relying on only @xmath55-contacts increases @xmath0 upto 10 times .",
    "so far we have considered ncs with bare surfaces .",
    "if ncs are covered by a thin shell of ligands or oxide leading to a nc separation @xmath58 , the conductance @xmath40 acquires an additional factor @xmath59 and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : minimal_g ] ) ,  ( [ eq : mit_final ] ) yield    @xmath60    in this case , the mit may become unreachable .",
    "we also can calculate the low temperature mobility @xmath61 in the vicinity of the mit . substituting the conductivity from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sharvin_2 ] ) into the expression @xmath62 ( where the factor @xmath63 accounts for the difference between the concentration of electrons inside ncs and the average concentration in the film ) we find the low - temperature metallic mobility @xmath64 for cdse ncs with @xmath65 , @xmath61 is on the order of @xmath66 at @xmath67 and is close to the experimentally observed room - temperature mobility of @xmath68 for cdse  @xcite .",
    "note that this mobility mostly is due to the contact resistance , while the in the case of bulk semiconductors the low temperature mobility is due to the scattering by donors .",
    "we now discuss the role of disorder .",
    "the number of donors @xmath69 in a nc randomly fluctuates between ncs with a gaussian distribution .",
    "if each nc were neutral ( @xmath70 ) , gaussian fluctuations of donor number , @xmath71 , would lead to substantial fluctuations @xmath72 of @xmath31 from one nc to another . to establish a unique chemical potential of electrons ( the fermi level ) , electrons move from ncs with larger than average @xmath19 to ones with smaller than average @xmath19 . accordingly , most ncs attain net charges @xmath73 .",
    "this leads to large fluctuations of the coulomb potential and moves the nc electron energy levels with respect to the fermi level .",
    "in an insulating nc array ( @xmath74 ) , this replaces the global charging energy gap of the density of states by the coulomb gap which leads to the efros - shklovskii variable range hopping  @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "this theory is based on the criterion ( [ eq : minimal_g ] ) , which guarantees that energy levels of ncs have a width comparable to the average energy difference between the adjacent levels @xmath75 .",
    "this also eliminates the anderson localization . at the same time , at @xmath76 , there is at least one electron channel in the contact disk with almost perfect transparency .",
    "this guarantees  @xcite that the charging energy of every single nc , @xmath77 , is reduced to a value much smaller than @xmath75 ( @xmath78 is effective dielectric constant of the nc film ) . accordingly , the mott - hubbard localization is eliminated at the same time as the anderson localization .",
    "we emphasize that criterion  ( [ eq : minimal_g ] ) is universal and holds for heavily doped nc films regardless of whether ncs are quantum - confined or not .",
    "a detailed discussion of this universality is presented in si2 [ sec : anderson ] .",
    "another generic disorder effect is the variation of nc sizes  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , in heavily doped ncs , this variation does not lead to anderson localization of electrons , because their spectrum is already random .",
    "thus , as for contacting metallic ncs , small variations of the diameter are inconsequential . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath79 15% size dispersion in our experiments below may complicate the matching of nc facets and therefore increase @xmath0 .",
    "to test the predictions of our theory , we studied the electron transport in films of heavily phosphorous ( p)-doped si ncs .",
    "freestanding si ncs were synthesized in a nonthermal radio - frequency plasma reactor as reported previously @xcite .",
    "we investigated six si nc films with different p concentrations .",
    "we refer to them using their nominal doping concentration @xmath80 , the fractional flow rate , defined as @xmath81/([ph_{3}]+[sih_{4}])}\\times 100\\%$ ] , where [ ph@xmath82 and [ sih@xmath83 are the flow rates of phosphine and silane .",

    "the film conductance decreases with decreasing temperature for all measurements , and es variable range hopping was observed for the majority of temperature range .",
    "@xmath99 is getting larger with increasing air exposure time , which indicates the decrease of the localization length with oxidation .",
    "this effect can be understood as follows @xcite . in es variable range hopping ,",
    "when an electron tunnels to a distant , non - neighboring nc at a distance _ x _ , its tunneling trajectory involves passing through a chain of intermediate ncs , and the decay of the electron wave function is dominated by passage through gaps between neighboring ncs along the chain .",
    "as a consequence , the wave function is suppressed by a factor of @xmath139 $ ] @xcite , so that the localization length is given by @xmath140 .",
    "the oxide growth on the si nc surface increases @xmath58 and reduces @xmath86 .",
    "the dynamics of the oxide growth on nc surface can be characterized by the elovich equation @xcite : @xmath141 , where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are reaction rate and characteristic time , respectively .",
    "now we have ,      the inverse localization length for oxidized si nc films is plotted against air exposure time in a linear - log scale as shown in figure [ fig : oxidation]b , and the red solid line is the fit with eq . .",
    "the experimental data are in good agreement with cabrera - mott oxidation mechanism .",
    "the characteristic time @xmath145 for p - doped si ncs is found to be 28 min , twice larger than the intrinsic h - terminated si ncs @xcite .",
    "this means faster oxidation of p - doped si ncs . in cabrera - mott mechanism ,",
    "an electron from the cleaved si - si bond is transferred to an adsorbed o@xmath114 molecule and the resulting o@xmath146 ion drifts toward the cleaved si - si bond with assistance of the electrostatic potential @xcite .",
    "since oxidation of si ncs requires electron tunneling , faster oxidation is expected in @xmath19-type doped si ncs @xcite , as we see in our system ."
