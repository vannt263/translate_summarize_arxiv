    "the topic of open access publishing has been extensively and controversially discussed . for general information",
    "see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "there are many models of open access named after different colors such as golden or green roads to open access @xcite , but we do not want to go into more details , here . concerning scientific publishing particularly in mathematics , we refer to @xcite and @xcite as well as to the references therein .",
    "in @xcite the authors illustrate a game - theoretic approach to open access publishing in order to understand different publication patterns within different scientific disciplines .",
    "the underlying observation is that there are communities where open access publishing is widely adopted , whereas other scientific communities are far away from practicing any open access publishing .",
    "first , different classical game settings are discussed namely a zero sum game , a game similar to the prisoners dilemma ( up to sign ) , and a stag hunt game version , all describing a nash equilibrium dilemma of the non - open access communities .",
    "second , these classical settings are transferred into their quantum game extensions which allow to tackle the dilemma mentioned that can not be solved within the classical setting .",
    "the classical approach in @xcite is formulated as a two - player game where the players are authors ( scientists ) in symmetrical situations .",
    "the two authors have the same set @xmath0 of strategies at their disposal .",
    "consequently , the game looks exactly the same to both of its players . for the open access game each player has to decide between the option to publish open access as the first strategy @xmath1 or , as the second strategy @xmath2 , to conventionally publish in traditional journals where articles go through peer reviewing . depending on the strategy chosen by the co - player ,",
    "the players aim to maximize their success of the game . due to the symmetric situation",
    "both players do not only have the same set of strategies but also have the same payoff matrices .",
    "in contrast to the approach of a symmetric two - scientists game , the present paper attempts to explain mathematically the open access play as a conflict of interest between scientists and publishers , as it is emphasized by the rapidly accumulating literature on open access and electronic publishing . assuming that the open access problem is not a conflict between those scientists who publish open access and those who do not , one takes the view that it is more adequate to understand the problem of open access as an asymmetric conflict between scientists and publishers .",
    "the crucial point of this view is that it actually suggests a bimatrix game describing this asymmetric setting .",
    "we do not explain why both players  scientists and publishers  behave as they do in the game situation described , but we will give a mathematical description of their interaction in the game .",
    "moreover , we do not argue for preferences in choosing one game strategy over another .",
    "we consider scientists and publishers as players in different positions them having different strategy sets as well as different payoff matrices .",
    "moreover , we take into consideration whole populations of players parts of which choose either one or the other strategy .",
    "the set of pure strategies for the scientists is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is publishing open access and @xmath2 stands for conventional publishing .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the relative parts of the scientists population playing strategy @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "if , for example , half of all scientists publishes open access and the other does not , one has @xmath5 . or , if the relation is @xmath6 to @xmath7 , then @xmath8 and @xmath9 . since @xmath10 and @xmath11 describe relative frequencies , we see that @xmath12 always holds true . hence , the set of all possible mixed strategies for the scientists population is @xmath13 the opponent population of publishers consists of two types playing pure strategies @xmath14 . here",
    "strategy @xmath15 means the publisher accepts or realizes open access publishing , whereas @xmath16 represents the strategy of definite declining any way of open access . for",
    "the publishers population let @xmath17 be the frequency of strategy @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "thus , all possible mixed strategies for the publishers population are given by the set @xmath20    in order to discuss the conflict of open access publishing , we proceed with establishing the payoff matrices @xmath21 for the scientists and @xmath22 for the publishers .",
    "each payoff depends on the strategies chosen by the participating players .",
    "a player in the scientists population using strategy @xmath23 against a player from the publishers population using strategy @xmath24 obtains the payoff @xmath25 , whereas the opponent obtains @xmath26 , with @xmath27 .    as reasoned in @xcite , it is convenient to assume that the scientist tries to maximize his scientific reputation .",
    "let @xmath28 denote the reputation payoff that the scientist is awarded .",
    "this payoff will be slightly reduced by @xmath29 in case of publishing open access .",
    "hence , we still have @xmath30 for the total reputation . in addition",
    ", we take into consideration the impact of an article by the scientist .",
    "the impact gives some payoff @xmath31 both for the scientist and for the publisher .",
    "further , this impact obviously will reduce by some @xmath32 , if the concerning journal is not sufficiently available .",
    "moreover , we assume that @xmath33 saying that the reduced impact in case of non - open access publishing is smaller than the loss of reputation in case of open access publishing .",
    "open access publishing will cause expenses @xmath34 that are shared equally by both players if both play their open access strategy .",
    "furthermore , @xmath35 expresses some moderate journal price scientists have to pay for library subscriptions as well as the compensation for expenses of the publisher .",
    "finally , let us introduce @xmath36 for exorbitant profit representing the prices of the most expensive journals coupled with continuing non - open access publishing and taking the tremendously increasing fees for access for granted . for our considerations",
    ", we make the realistic assumption that @xmath37 is so large that the inequality @xmath38 holds true , which is equivalent to @xmath39 we already have @xmath40 and the open access expenses @xmath41 actually can not exceed the upper bound given by this inequality .",
    "if an open access publishing scientist meets a publisher accepting open access , the scientist will get his reduced reputation , his research impact , and will pay for maintaining some open access publishing system as well as for the journal subscription .",
    "the publisher takes the price for the journal subscription and some amount given by the impact .",
    "apart from this , the publisher contributes to some extent to open access .",
    "hence , the payoff is @xmath42 for the scientist and @xmath43 for the publisher .",
    "if the scientist s strategy is open access whereas the publisher plays the non - open access strategy , the scientist s payoff will be @xmath44 .",
    "the scientists have to run the open access completely by themselves and do not have any expenses for journal subscriptions . for the publisher nothing happens and hence the payoff is @xmath45 .",
    "a non - open access publishing scientist gets his full reputation @xmath46 but only reduced research impact @xmath47 .",
    "additionally , the journal has to be paid , which reduces the payoff by @xmath48 .",
    "if the publisher s counter - strategy is open access , the payoff for the scientist will be @xmath49 . in this case the payoff for the publisher will be @xmath50 paying the total sum for open access acceptance .",
    "moreover , the payoff is @xmath51 for the scientist and @xmath52 for the publisher in case of the non - open access strategy of the publisher .",
    "altogether , we have the complete income - and - loss statement as given in table  [ tabelle1 ] .    .[tabelle1 ] complete payoffs [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     where the horizontal arrows picture the change of the publishers strategies and the vertical arrows illustrate the deviation in the scientists strategies .",
    "this dealing with an `` oscillating '' system requires a non - static approach .",
    "therefore , we consider the frequencies of the strategies within both populations as time - dependent quantities which are differentiable functions of @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath27 .",
    "the first derivatives of these functions @xmath56 describe the rate of growth of the respective frequencies .    modeling the dynamics and the cyclic behavior of that system , we follow the ideas of hofbauer and sigmund developed in @xcite , chapter  10.3 .",
    "the increase of strategy @xmath23 of the scientists population is given by the per capita growth rate @xmath57 and equals the difference between its payoff @xmath58 and the average payoff @xmath59 .",
    "the same holds true for the publishers population .",
    "this leads to the system of ordinary differential equations @xmath60 for @xmath27 .",
    "let us look closer at these differential equations .",
    "we have @xmath61 and @xmath62 hence , @xmath63 and @xmath64 since @xmath12 and @xmath65 , it is admissible to introduce new variables @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( then @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) and consider the corresponding differential equations for @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "these are @xmath72 and similarly @xmath73 now , let us introduce new constants by @xmath74 which are positive by lemma  [ lemma - positive ] .",
    "hence , only two equations are remaining namely @xmath75 this is an adequate form for investigating the qualitative behavior of the system .    the subsequent section is devoted to a further investigation of the dynamics of the system given by equations  ( [ sys-1 ] )  and  ( [ sys-2 ] ) .",
    "we consider the square @xmath76 .",
    "obviously , @xmath77 by @xmath78    we use symplectic techniques for investigating what happens in the interior @xmath79 of @xmath80 .",
    "more precisely , in order to prove that the orbits of the system  ( [ sys-1 ] )  and  ( [ sys-2 ] ) are closed and do not leave @xmath79 we describe the whole setting as a hamiltonian system .    the interior of @xmath80 is the open subset @xmath81 of @xmath82 .",
    "the function @xmath83 given by @xmath84 is positive .",
    "hence , @xmath85 defines a @xmath86-form @xmath87 on @xmath88 .",
    "since we are in dimension @xmath86 the following is clear .",
    "the pair @xmath89 is a symplectic manifold .",
    "@xmath90    we are going to derive that equations  ( [ sys-1 ] )  and  ( [ sys-2 ] ) are the equations of motion of the hamiltonian system @xmath91 where the hamiltonian @xmath92 is defined as @xmath93    the notion of hamiltonian systems is well - known and widely used in mathematical physics to describe the behavior of systems in classical mechanics . in physics",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath94 describes the energy of the system under consideration .",
    "hence , it would be interesting to understand , what intrinsic property is determined by the `` energy '' of open access publishing .",
    "[ ham_vf ] the hamiltonian vector field of @xmath91 is given by @xmath95    generally , @xmath96 is defined by the equation @xmath97 clearly , @xmath98 if @xmath99 is any vector field on @xmath88 with functions @xmath100 and @xmath101 as components , then @xmath102 hence , @xmath103 if and only if @xmath104 which proves the assertion .",
    "let us remind that motions of the hamiltonian system @xmath91 are curves @xmath105 in @xmath88 satisfying the differential equation @xmath106    altogether , we now can prove the following proposition .",
    "the solutions of ( [ sys-1 ] )  and  ( [ sys-2 ] ) are exactly the motions of the hamiltonian system @xmath91 .",
    "we have @xmath107 and @xmath108 thus , equations  ( [ sys-1 ] )  and  ( [ sys-2 ] ) are equivalent to @xmath109 which implies the statement by lemma  [ ham_vf ] .    as a consequence , the solutions in @xmath88 of the system  ( [ sys-1 ] )  and  ( [ sys-2 ] ) correspond to level set curves of the hamiltonian @xmath94 , i.e. the hamiltonian @xmath94 is constant along solutions .",
    "let @xmath110 give a solution of equations  ( [ sys-1 ] )  and  ( [ sys-2 ] )",
    ". then @xmath111    indeed , @xmath112 by using ( [ sys-1 ] ) as well as ( [ sys-2 ] ) for replacing @xmath113 and @xmath114 .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we want to discuss the shape of the level set curves of @xmath94 .",
    "in particular , we will show that these curves are closed , which implies that the solutions of ( [ sys-1 ] )  and  ( [ sys-2 ] ) are periodic .",
    "first , we are going to determine the extremal points of @xmath94 .",
    "by @xmath115 and @xmath116 we obtain @xmath117 as necessary conditions for a critical point @xmath118 .",
    "this leads to @xmath119 which corresponds exactly to our nash equilibrium described in lemma  [ nash - equ ] .",
    "by @xmath120 we have @xmath121 at the point @xmath118 .",
    "this implies that the matrix @xmath122 is negative definite showing that @xmath94 takes in @xmath118 a maximum as the unique extremum .",
    "second , since @xmath123 we have @xmath124 for each @xmath125 in the boundary @xmath126 of @xmath80 .",
    "hence , the graph of the hamiltonian @xmath94 looks like a hill over the square @xmath80 .     with parameters @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130,width=264 ]    the top of the hill represents the unique maximum . towards the boundary @xmath126 , the hill crashes into bottomless depths .     with parameters @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130,width=226 ]    since all solutions of our system correspond to level set curves , they are visualized as contour lines of the hill described .",
    "hence , all orbits surround the point @xmath118 and remain in @xmath88 .",
    "obviously , the model presented here is a basic approach to discuss the phenomenon of multiple arrangements of realizing open access publishing in different scientific communities .",
    "however , in contrast to the approach presented in @xcite it treats open access publishing in a canonical way as a game between scientists and publishers .",
    "the behavior of oscillation on closed orbits is a rather rough and simplified view of the whole scenario .",
    "we do not consider this model to be universally valid , but throughout a certain period of time it seems to allow a reasonably satisfying description of insights which are intuitively clear .",
    "this model can be modified .",
    "for instance , taking into account that both the parameter @xmath131 reducing the scientist s reputation in case of open access publishing and the value of @xmath132 expressing the reduced impact in case of non - open access publishing may change in the context of the game .",
    "for example , if the rate of open access publishing scientists increases , @xmath131 will be supposed to decrease etc . playing a little bit and slightly altering the model presented here may result in further refinements .",
    "moreover , the huge number of evolutionary game - theoretic approaches in the literature allows a lot of modifications and further developments of these concepts .",
    "they vary from biological game theory to concepts that are more applicable in economic contexts .",
    "these models are good sources and suitable to establish further improvements in a more fundamental manner , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite as well as the references therein .",
    "the authors have benefited from many discussions with both scientists and information professionals and particularly from the working context of the first author as a mathematician as well as a subject librarian .",
    "the idea developed in this note arose during the 5th spring school on geometry and mathematical physics at hiddensee in may 2007 .",
    "both authors thank the biological station of hiddensee for the kind hospitality as well as for the inspiring working atmosphere , the organizer of the workshop stephan block for his invitation , and the participants for the intensive discussion ."
