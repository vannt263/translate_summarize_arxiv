    "the statistical properties of quantum system attract considerable attention in the broad field of modern physics ranging from nuclear , atomic and molecular physics to condensed matter and quantum computing . of a special interest",
    "is the properties specifying the quantum chaos border for a system of many - body quantum states .",
    "extensive investigations of many - body interacting systems such as nuclei , many - electron atoms , quantum dots , quantum spin glasses and quantum computer models @xcite have shown that the border is associated with a crossover of level spacing statistics from the poisson distribution to wigner - dyson one and with a transition to ergodic distribution for the eigenstate wavefunction over the large number of basis levels as in random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite . in a sense",
    "the interaction leads to dynamic thermalization without coupling to an external thermal bath .",
    "according to @xcite this crossover takes place when the coupling matrix elements of the hamiltonian become comparable to the energy spacing between directly coupled states .",
    "we address this problem to a generic system of coupled quantum states , the hamiltonian matrix @xmath3 of that includes the leading diagonal with disordered random values and the random off - diagonal elements inside the band of size @xmath4 .",
    "this band random matrix with the disordered diagonal ( brmdd ) is a reasonable model describing the systems with strong imperfection in the basis state energies .",
    "models based on brmdd were applied to study the electron transport problem @xcite and the problem of interacting particles in a random potential @xcite .",
    "the results obtained for these models are of an obvious interest also in analyzing such few - freedoms physical objects as the vibrational quasicontinuum of polyatomic molecule @xcite and a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of brmdd - based systems were studied in some details @xcite .",
    "the shape , the localization length and the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) for eigenfunction have been investigated with the help of numerical simulations @xcite and the supersymmetry approach @xcite .",
    "these investigations have exhibited the lorentzian shape for local spectral density ( lsd ) in circumstances when a non - perturbative localization regime is realized .",
    "the state - state interaction strength , at which the eigenstates are extended over the whole matrix size @xmath5 and the eigenenergy level spacing statistics has the wigner - dyson form , have been revealed for brmdd with sufficiently large band ( when @xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the ergodic properties of lsd have not been investigated in details .",
    "an open question is also the quantum chaos border for brmdd with arbitrary small band .    in the paper we study localization and ergodicity properties of lsd to be obtained from brmdd with arbitrary small band .",
    "the lsd was introduced in 1955 by wigner @xcite and successfully employed in rmt to describe statistically the localization effects for complex quantum systems @xcite ( including the systems , represented by band random matrices with the reordered leading diagonal @xcite ) .",
    "this quantity is the fourier transform for the correlation function @xmath7 and specifies spreading of the energy , initially concentrated in a specific unperturbed basis state @xmath8 , between the eigenstates due to state - state interaction .",
    "generally the lsd may be characterized by the width @xmath9 measuring the energy scale , in that the individual state @xmath10 is localized . the number of eigenstates populating this scale is given in terms of the product    @xmath11    designated here as _",
    "an ergodic localization length _ of lsd ( @xmath12 is the eigenstate density ) .",
    "hence the quantity @xmath13 specifies the greatest possible number of eigenstates , where the basis state @xmath14 can be effectively admixed .",
    "the ergodic properties for the system can be identified with the structure of lsd .",
    "the non - ergodic lsd is a strongly fluctuating spiked function and the ipr @xmath15 , which gives the actual number of eigenstates involving the state @xmath8 , is low in comparison with @xmath13 . in the ergodicity case",
    "the lsd is monotonic and the number @xmath15 approaches the value of @xmath13 .",
    "the main attention of our study is paid to the perturbative and localized regimes for lsd .",
    "therefore we restrict the study to a moderate strength of state - state interaction .",
    "this restriction implies that the width @xmath9 is essentially small as compared to the energy scale bounding the location of the eigenstate levels ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the finite - size effects are ignored .",
    "hence the quantities @xmath13 and @xmath15 can be considered as functions of the interaction strength and the relative width of band .",
    "we investigate the lsd shape and determine the ergodic localization length .",
    "then we analyze the behavior of ipr for ergodic and non - ergodic lsd . from this analysis",
    "we obtain criterions specifying the transition to localized and ergodic regimes for lsd .",
    "we consider a brmdd , that represents the hamiltonian matrix @xmath3 in the basis of unperturbed states @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) for isolated system of @xmath19 quantum states.the brmdd is a real symmetric matrix with statistically independent random elements @xmath20 where off - diagonal elements @xmath21 specify the state - state interaction .",
    "the values of @xmath22 are distributed uniformly in the interval @xmath23 $ ] with @xmath24 and @xmath25 if @xmath26 or are zero otherwise .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath27 corresponding to energy levels for the states @xmath17 are uniformly distributed according to the poisson statistics with the mean spacing @xmath28 between adjacent energy levels : @xmath29 .",
    "the energy level @xmath30 for a probing state @xmath8 is located in the midpoint of interval @xmath31 $ ] : @xmath32 .",
    "the perturbation of an individual basis state depends on the relative level position for unperturbed states , those are coupled directly with the state by interaction .",
    "therefore the strength of state - state interaction for brmdd can be specified in terms of the ratio @xmath0 , where @xmath33 is the energy spacing between directly coupled unperturbed states .",
    "here the relative band width @xmath34 gives the relative number of states coupled directly with the individual state .",
    "depending on the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath4 , three important regimes can be distinguished @xcite . when the coupling matrix elements are weak and @xmath35 the perturbative regime is realized . at the regime",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) can be treated within the framework of perturbation theory .",
    "the condition @xmath36 features the regime , at that the eigenstates are localized .",
    "the strong interaction at @xmath37 is responsible for the delocalized regime for eigenfunction . in the regime",
    "the eigenstates are extended over the whole matrix size @xmath5 .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath38 and the eigenenergies @xmath39 are obtained from diagonalization of ( [ hamilt ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath40 gives a probability to find the probing state @xmath8 in the eigenstate @xmath38 .",
    "the numerical simulation is performed for the wide range of matrix parameters : @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the number of disorder realizations lies in the range from 100 to 1000 .",
    "the shape of lsd is studied for the eigenenergy scale , which is no larger than @xmath44 . for this scale",
    "the interaction - induced variations in level density are negligible and the eigenenergies are homogeneously distributed with the density @xmath45 . then the lsd can be defined as @xmath46 where @xmath47 means the averaging over disorder ( that is , over many random matrices ) .",
    "the numerical investigation confirms that the lsd is described by the well - known breit - wigner distribution of the lorentzian shape @xmath48 ( see the inset in fig.[figl(q ) ] ) with the width @xmath9 .",
    "this shape is observed for any @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 satisfying @xmath49 ( including the parameter region where @xmath50 ) .",
    "we find the ergodic localization length @xmath13 from ( [ erglength ] ) where the width @xmath51 is estimated by fitting of the lorentzian ( [ bwdistr ] ) to an averaged lsd .",
    "our analysis of numerical data obtained for different values of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath52 shows that the quantity @xmath13 can be considered as a function of the single parameter @xmath53 which defines essentially the localization of lsd in the eigenenergy scale . when the coupling of the basis states by perturbation is sufficiently strong and @xmath54 the quantity @xmath13 satisfies the fermi golden rule : @xmath55 . at low values of @xmath56 ( @xmath57 )",
    "the length @xmath13 can be described by a linear function of @xmath56 : @xmath58 .",
    "the width @xmath9 is then much smaller as compared to the spacing @xmath28 .",
    "fig.[figl(q ) ] demonstrates the behavior of @xmath13 in the wide range of @xmath56 at three fixed magnitudes of @xmath52 .",
    "[ h ! ] = 8 cm    the linear dependence of @xmath13 and @xmath9 on the strength of state - state coupling for small @xmath56 can be explained in terms of a simple perturbation approach to the eigenenergy levels @xmath59 located in the vicinity of @xmath30 : @xmath60 . in the approach",
    "the eigenstate @xmath38 is considered as a superposition of the nearest basis states @xmath10 and @xmath61 .",
    "the probability @xmath62 to find the basis state @xmath8 in the eigenstate @xmath63 can be then estimated from a two - state ( the states @xmath64 and @xmath61 ) approximation . according to this approximation",
    "the dependence of @xmath62 on @xmath59 for an individual disorder realization is lorentzian - like @xmath65 with the width of @xmath66 .",
    "if the states @xmath10 and @xmath61 are not coupled by interaction the dependence ( [ wn0 ] ) is considered as a function , the width of that is negligible in comparison to @xmath1 .",
    "the probability that the states @xmath10 and @xmath61 are coupled by interaction is equal to @xmath52 . as a result",
    "the shape of disorder - averaged lsd is described by the lorentzian - like contour with the width @xmath67 .",
    "it seems that this perturbation approach can be applied also for the eigenstates with @xmath68 , when the probability @xmath62 is essentially small as compared to the contributions of others basis states . in this limit",
    "( [ wn0 ] ) gives @xmath69 , as predicted in the framework of a standard perturbation approach for non - degenerate states ( see , for instance , in @xcite ) .    in order to estimate the localization properties of lsd at intermediate values of @xmath56 we approximate the behavior of ergodic length for the wide range of @xmath56 ( @xmath70 )",
    "the analysis of numerical data shows that the length @xmath13 can be well approximated by @xmath71 with the fitted coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 . according to ( [ l(q ) ] ) an accurate boundary between the linear and quadratic dependencies of @xmath13 on @xmath56",
    "is obtained at @xmath74 where @xmath75 . notice that this boundary separates the ranges where the value of @xmath13 is low or high as compared to @xmath76 .",
    "the ipr @xmath77 is associated with the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath52 , which specify correspondingly the ergodic localization length @xmath13 for lsd and the band width for brmdd .",
    "this association depends on whether or not the lsd is ergodic . in the ergodic case the probing state is monotonically spread over eigenstates in the energy scale @xmath9 .",
    "then the ipr is a function of the only parameter @xmath56 and approaches the ergodic length @xmath13 .",

    "then the ipr approaches asymptotically the length @xmath13 from below with increasing @xmath56 . at high magnitudes of @xmath56 and @xmath52 , when the exponential ( [ iprnonerg ] ) gives higher values of @xmath15 in comparison to @xmath13 ,",
