    "one of the important research areas of the contemporary high energy physics has been the study of matter under extreme conditions . such a matter , in the laboratory can be produced by colliding heavy ions at ultra - relativistic energies . due to asymptotic freedom of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , it is predicted that the hadronic matter at high temperature and/or density can undergo a series of phase transitions like confinement - deconfinement and/or chiral phase transition @xcite . in the high density regime qcd",
    "predicts the existence of color superconducting state @xcite . these apart , the possibility of spin polarized quark liquid _",
    "i.e. _ the existence of ferromagnetic phase in dense quark system has also been suggested recently with which we are presently concerned @xcite .",
    "the properties of dense quark system are particularly relevant for the study of various astrophysical phenomenon .",
    "the part of the motivation to study the ferromagnetic phase transition in dense quark matter ( dqm ) , as mentioned in @xcite is provided by the discovery of ` magnetars ' @xcite where an extraordinarily high magnetic field @xmath3 exists @xcite . in @xcite , it is argued , that the origin of such a high magnetic field can be attributed to the existence of spin polarized quark matter @xcite . to examine the possibility of ferromagnetism in dqm in ref.@xcite a variational calculation is performed where it is observed that there exists a critical density below which spin polarized quark matter is energetically favorable than unpolarized state .",
    "subsequently various other calculations were also performed to investigate this issue @xcite .",
    "for example , in @xcite it is shown that there is no contradiction between color superconductivity and ferromagnetism and both of these phase can co - exist . in @xcite ,",
    "the same problem was studied in the large @xmath4 and @xmath5 limit while keeping @xmath6 fixed where it was shown that spin polarized state can exist , however , in presence of magnetic screening , color superconductivity or dense chiral waves disappear .",
    "it might be mentioned that such screening is now supported by the lattice calculation @xcite .",
    "in@xcite it is analytically shown that , if quarks are massless , ferromagnetism does not appear which is consistent with the conclusion drawn in @xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite shows that ferromagnetism might appear in quark matter with goldstone boson current where the magnetization is shown to be related to triangle anomalies .",
    "in the present work , we apply relativistic fermi liquid theory ( rflt ) to study the possibility of para - ferro phase transition in dqm .",
    "the relativistic fermi liquid theory was developed by baym and chin @xcite where it has been shown how the various physical quantities like chemical potential ( @xmath7 ) , incompressibility ( @xmath0 ) , sound velocity ( @xmath1 ) etc .",
    "can be expressed in terms of the landau parameters ( lps ) calculated relativistically .",
    "however , the formalism developed in @xcite is valid for unpolarized matter and lps calculated there are spin averaged .    in this paper",
    "we extend the formalism of rflt and the required lps are calculated by retaining their explicit spin dependencies . as a result ,",
    "here various combination of parameters like @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 corresponding to scattering involving up - up , up - down , down - up or down - down spins are appear @xcite .",
    "once determined , these parameters are used to calculate quantities like chemical potentials for the spin up and spin down quarks or the total energy density of the system as a function of @xmath12 and @xmath13 together with various other quantities as we shall see . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 correspond to densities of spin up , down quarks respectively and @xmath16 , denotes total quark density @xcite .",
    "we , also compare some of our results with those presented in @xcite where more direct approach was adopted to calculate the total energy density from the loop .",
    "in addition , the present work is extended further to estimate incompressibility and sound velocity in dense quark system for a given fraction of spin - up or down quarks .",
    "furthermore , in dealing with the massless gluons , we find that naive series expansion fails and one has to use hard density loop ( hdl ) corrected gluon propagator to get the finite result for the lps involving scattering of like spins @xcite .",
    "this however does not cause any problem for the calculation of various physical quantities like chemical potential , exchange energy , incompressibility etc .",
    "we shall see , even though @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( suppressing spin indices ) individually remain divergent , what appears in our case is the particular combination of these parameters where such divergences cancel .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec.ii , as mentioned before , we extend the formalism of rflt to include explicit spin dependence . in sec.iii , we derive spin dependent lps due to one gluon exchange ( oge ) for polarized quark matter .",
    "subsequently , we calculate chemical potential and energy density .",
    "we find the density dependence of incompressibility @xmath19 and first sound velocity @xmath20 with arbitrary spin polarization @xmath2 . to compare with ref.@xcite ,",
    "we present ultra - relativistic and non - relativistic results and studied para - ferro phase transition of quark matter .",

    "to summarize and conclude , in this work we have applied rflt to study the properties of dense quark matter .",

    "we also show how the physical quantities like chemical potential of spin up and spin down states , their energy densities and the quantities like incompressibility , sound velocity for polarized quark matter can be expressed in terms of these spin dependent rflps . for the scattering involving like spin states , the lps @xmath104 and @xmath11 are found to diverge . however , we show that the combination in which they appear in the calculation of the physical quantities such divergences cancel . for the scattering involving unlike spin states no such divergence appear .",
    "the appearance of such divergences is related to the unscreened gluonic interaction between the quarks which might be cured by invoking hard dense loop corrected gluon propagator .",

    "we reconfirm that dqm can exhibit ferromagnetism at low density as was originally suggested in @xcite . however , the density at which the spin polarized ferromagnetic state in the present model might appear depends strongly on the quark mass . the critical density increases with increasing mass . in fig .",
    "( [ engtot ] ) , we observe that states with @xmath110 appear only below or around normal nuclear density where deconfined quark matter is not likely to exist .",
    "we can not , however , ascertain the critical density from the present analysis where we restrict ourselves only to oge diagrams and one flavor system . in this regime ,",
