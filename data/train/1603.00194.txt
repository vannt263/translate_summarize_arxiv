    "active systems produce energy at the level of their individual components and naturally exist out of thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the most obvious examples are living matter , animals , plants and bacteria , but inanimate systems , such as vertically vibrated granular layers , are also considered active , and there are many parallels between the behaviour of active and driven matter .",
    "active systems occur across length scales .",
    "well studied macroscopic examples include flocks of birds and schools of fish . on a micron length scale ,",
    "swimming bacteria and crawling and dividing cells provide a rich testing ground for the theories of active matter . within cells",
    "there is a highly active environment , with molecular motors of size a few nanometres converting chemical to mechanical energy to organise cellular processes and hence power life .",
    "why is active matter of interest to a physicist ?",
    "we are dealing with energy , work and motion , and often with fluctuations , standard physical concepts . describing the motion of swimming bacteria",
    "has an august place in the history of fluid mechanics .",
    "the collective behaviour of active systems appears to have many similarities across length scales , suggesting that understanding based on generic principles rather than individual details might be useful .",
    "moreover experiments on active matter provide a testing ground for the theories of non - equilibrium statistical physics .",
    "scientists are also taking the first steps towards an active technology .",
    "active colloids are autonomous micro - machines and miniature driven swimmers can carry payloads and mix fluids in microscopic channels . bacteria are able to turn micron - scale flywheels and to sort passive colloids . even more exciting is the future possibility of imitating cellular transport and organisation , processes which have evolved over millennia to maximise efficiency in the strongly fluctuating environment of the cell .",
    "these lectures concentrate on the hydrodynamics of active matter ; the behaviour in a background fluid .",
    "i shall first consider single microswimmers , such as a swimming bacterium .",
    "because of their size , the motion of microswimmers is governed by the stokes equations , the low reynolds number limit of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "this has two far - reaching consequences , the scallop theorem which controls the form of the swimming stroke , and the nematic symmetry of the swimmers far flow field . after explaining these concepts and discussing the mathematics behind them",
    "i shall show how they impact upon the interaction between swimmers and tracer particles , and how microswimmers move near a surface and in poiseuille flow .",
    "the second half of the lectures will deal with the hydrodynamics of dense suspensions of active nematic particles .",
    "i shall show how a simple extension of the continuum equations of motion of nematic liquid crystals describes active hydrodynamics and leads to a state termed active turbulence characterised by a continually changing pattern of jets and vortices in the velocity field and by the creation and annihilations of walls and topological defects in the director field .",
    "active turbulence has been observed in dense swimmer suspensions , in confluent cellular layers and in mixtures of microtubules and molecular motors .",
    "i shall compare experiments with numerical solutions of the active nematohydrodynamic equations and discuss the mechanisms behind active turbulence .",
    "lecture 1 describes the hydrodynamics of a single microswimmer and starts by introducing the stokes equations as the low reynolds number limit of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "i motivate the scallop theorem , that a swimming stroke must be non - invariant in time for a net swimmer motion , and show how this relates to bacterial swimming strategies .",
    "i then introduce the multipole expansion and argue that , because swimmers are force free , their far flow field is generically dipolar , with nematic symmetry @xcite .",
    "i write down the continuum equations of motion of a simple fluid and take the zero reynolds number limit , appropriate to many colloidal and active systems , to obtain the stokes equations . +   + the navier - stokes equations , that provide a continuum description of the flow of a newtonian , incompressible fluid , are @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the velocity at position @xmath2 and time @xmath3 of a fluid of density @xmath4 and dynamic viscosity @xmath5 driven by a pressure gradient @xmath6 and a body force ( force per unit volume ) @xmath7 .",
    "the terms on the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ns ] ) are the inertial terms which describe the transport of momentum and @xmath8 describes the viscous dissipation that results from velocity gradients .",
    "dimensionless variables denoted by a tilde , can be defined by choosing a length scale @xmath9 and a velocity scale @xmath10 @xmath11 in terms of the dimensionless variables the navier - stokes equation becomes @xmath12 eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaledns ] ) shows that relative magnitude of the inertial and viscous terms in the navier - stokes equation is characterised by a dimensionless number , the reynolds number @xmath13 for water @xmath14 , so colloids moving in microflows and micro - swimmers with length scales @xmath15 m and velocity scales @xmath15ms@xmath16 have reynolds numbers @xmath17 .",
    "thus the inertial terms can be neglected , and the navier - stokes equations reduce to the stokes equations @xmath18 the zero @xmath19 limit has interesting physical consequences .",
    "moreover the stokes equations are linear and hence more tractable mathematically .",
    "a far - reaching consequence of the @xmath20 limit is purcell s scallop theorem : to achieve propulsion at zero reynolds number in newtonian fluids a swimmer must deform in a way that is not invariant under time reversal . +   + there is no explicit time dependence in the stokes equations which implies kinematic reversibility .",
    "a striking example of this is provided by a blob of dye suspended in a high viscosity fluid contained between two cylinders .",
    "when the fluid is sheared by rotating the outer cylinder the dyed blob can be stretched to wrap several times around the inner cylinder . if the motion of the cylinders is reversed the dyed fluid returns to its original shape .",
    "this is the physics behind the scallop theorem @xcite . as a swimmer moves through a low @xmath19 fluid",
    "there is nothing in the equations of motion of the surrounding fluid that picks out a preferred direction .",
    "if the boundary conditions , i.e.  the swimmer s stroke cycle , is invariant under time reversal as well , its net displacement after each cycle must be zero  otherwise reversing time would give the same physical system , but a different displacement .",
    "therefore at zero @xmath19 the stroke must be non - invariant under time reversal to allow swimming .",
    "microscopic swimmers have evolved several strategies to overcome the scallop theorem ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "many move by using long , thin appendages called flagella .",
    "bacterial flagella ( e.g.  _ e. coli _ ) are driven by rotary motors which induce helical waves to overcome the scallop theorem .",
    "eukaryotic flagella tend to oscillate through bending waves .",
    "_ paramecium _ is covered by cilia , shorter but similar in structure to eukaryotic flagella that have distinct power and recovery strokes .",
    "cilia also act as pumps in the body , clearing mucus from the lungs and in the fallopian tubes to facilitate moving the ovum from the ovary to the uterus .",
    "_ euglena metaboly",
    "_ produces a suitable swimming stroke by altering its body shape so that the relative motion of its ends is coupled to changes in their mass .",
    "at least three degrees of freedom are needed to define a suitable stoke for zero @xmath19 swimming .",
    "a simple model swimmer is the three - sphere swimmer , which comprises three spheres coupled by rods @xcite .",
    "the rods have no hydrodynamic coupling to the fluid , but specifying their lengths as a function of time serves to define the swimming stroke .",
    "the stroke and the swimmer displacement as a function of time are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the advantage of building the swimmer out of spheres is that the flow field around a sphere is known analytically in the stokes limit @xcite .",
    "hence exact results can be obtained for the swimming speed if the sphere radii are small compared to their separation .",
    "another widely used model swimmer is the squirmer @xcite , useful because it admits an exact solution and also because it is spherical which helps to disentangle steric and hydrodynamic effects in simulations .",
    "the squirmer is a sphere of radius @xmath21 , and motion is imposed by choosing suitable velocity boundary conditions on the surface of the sphere . defining a spherical polar co - ordinate system with the squirmer velocity along @xmath22 , the radial velocity at the surface",
    "is taken to be zero and the tangential surface velocity is a power series in the first derivatives of the legendre polynomials @xmath23;l .. where the @xmath24 can depend on time .    consider the simplest non - trivial example , @xmath25 . in the rest frame of the squirmer , which is moving with velocity @xmath26 along the @xmath22-axis , it is easy check that the solution to the stokes equations that obeys these boundary conditions is @xmath27 note that there is no term in @xmath28 in the far field expansion  ( [ eq : squirmer ] )",
    "this is a general feature of active systems and in the next section we explain why .",
    "we introduce the multipole expansion , a far field expansion for the flow field around a localised force distribution . for active systems , with no applied forces or torques , the far field velocity has dipolar symmetry .",
    "+   + for a point force @xmath29 acting at the origin the stokes equations  ( [ eq : stokes ] ) can be solved exactly . the resulting velocity field , termed the stokeslet , and the corresponding pressure field , at a relative position @xmath2 from the swimmer are @xcite @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stokeslet ] ) @xmath31 is the unit tensor , and @xmath32 is a reference , constant pressure .",
    "@xmath33 is the greens function of the stokes equations , often called the oseen tensor ( and often defined having removed the factor @xmath34 ) .",
    "there are several ways of obtaining the stokeslet , none of them very simple . a clear and helpful list of the possible approaches is given by maciej lisicki at http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6231 .",
    "we extend eq .",
    "( [ eq : stokeslet ] ) to a force distribution @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 taylor expanding about the origin @xmath38 the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : multipole ] ) , @xmath39 , is the monopole contribution to the flow field .",
    "it is the stokeslet flow field that results from the net force acting on the fluid .",
    "[ flowfig ]    we now come to a key point in the argument : a swimmer that moves autonomously can exert * no net force or torque * on the fluid : all forces and torques must balance as a consequence of newton s second law .",
    "therefore the far flow field will , to leading order , generically be given by the next term in the multipole expansion .",
    "this is the dipolar term @xmath40 where @xmath41 it is conventional to write @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a traceless symmetric tensor , referred to as the _ stresslet _ , and @xmath44 is an asymmetric tensor , the _ rotlet_. subtracting @xmath45 is permissible because @xmath46 and hence it can be shown that this term does not change the velocity field .",
    "the stresslet @xmath47 is connected to straining flows and , as we shall see below , it is responsible for additional stress in a fluid in the presence of colloids or swimmers .",
    "the rotlet term arises if the force distribution has a net torque .",
    "it is zero for microswimmers because they are torque - free .    as a concrete example , to see what a dipolar flow field looks like ,",
    "consider a pair of equal and opposite co - linear forces of strength @xmath48 acting at @xmath49 .",
    "the stresslet corresponding to this force distribution is diagonal @xmath50 some lines of algebra show that the derivative of the stokeslet is @xmath51 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : stresslet ] ) and ( [ eq : stressletflow ] ) in the multipole expansion ( [ eq : multipole ] ) shows that the dipolar term corresponds to a radial flow field @xmath52 with the characteristic @xmath53 dipolar dependence .    figs .",
    "2a and 2b compare the flow field of a stokeslet , due to a point force , and a stresslet , due to equal and opposite forces .",
    "note the different symmetries .",
    "for the stokeslet there is a net velocity in the direction of the applied force whereas the dipolar field due to the stresslet has reflection symmetry about a line through the centre of the swimmer .",
    "this nematic symmetry will be important later , both in understanding the behaviour of tracer particles near a microswimmer and when i discuss the collective behaviour of active systems .",

    "higher order , quadrupolar terms , @xmath56 , also depend on @xmath57 , a pathology of this simple model . )",
    "the symmetry of the three sphere swimmer means that the dipole moment is zero for equal arm lengths , and the flow field is quadrupolar .    in figs .",
    "2(c  e ) we compare experimental results for three microswimmers , _",
    "e. coli _ , _ chlamydomonas _ and _ volvox _ @xcite .",
    "e. coli _ and _ chlamydomonas _ the far flow field is indeed dipolar , but there are significant deviations even rather far from the swimmers due to higher order terms in the multipole expansion . for _",

    "the _ e. coli _ is acting as a * pusher * creating an * extensile * flow field . for",
    "_ chlamydomonas _ the sign of the dipole is reversed , the swimmer is acting as a * puller * , creating a * contractile * flow , pumping fluid out from the sides and in to the ends of the body . the flow field of _ volvox _ , however , has a very different symmetry .",
    "this is because it is a much bigger organism , that swims upwards against gravity .",
    "this provides a net force on the swimmer and hence a stokeslet term which dominates in the far field .",
    "lecture 2 considers physical situations where flow fields are relevant to the behaviour of biological systems .",
    "i first discuss how a passing swimmer moves tracer particles in its vicinity , leading to simple models for the enhancement of diffusion by active particles .",

    "several experiments and simulations have shown that , as might be expected , bacteria enhance diffusion as a result of the flow fields they produce @xcite .",
    "i present a discussion of model systems aiming to explain how tracer particles move in a microswimmer suspension @xcite .",
    "+   + the instantaneous statistics of the velocity field govern the initial rate of displacement of a tracer particle .",
    "however at later times the path taken by a tracer will depend on the detailed spatial and temporal correlations of the velocity . comparing the flow fields in figs .",
    "2a and b it seems likely that tracers move in a quantitatively different way as a force - free swimmer ( stresslet ) or as a colloid ( stokeslet ) move past .    [ tracer ]    consider a swimmer that moves in a straight line from @xmath58 to @xmath59 along the @xmath22-axis . the resulting displacement of a material sheet , a plane of tracers initially perpendicular to the swimmer path is shown in fig .",
    "3 . in the figure the swimmer path",
    "is denoted by a black line , and the initial tracer positions by faint black dots .",
    "the paths of selected tracers are shown in red , and the final position of the deformed sheet of tracers in blue .",
    "these results were obtained from a numerical solution of the stokes equations using a boundary element method which determines the flow field and swimming velocity of the swimmer subject to no - slip boundary conditions on the swimmer surface , and the constraints that zero net force and torque act on the swimmer @xcite .",
    "the striking feature of the tracer trajectories is their loop - like character .",
    "this is a consequence of the angular dependence of the flow field ( see fig .",
    "if the tracer is sufficiently far from the swimmer that its velocity is small compared to the swimmer velocity the loops are closed .",
    "this can be inferred from the symmetry of the dipolar flow field by considering how a tracer moves in the rest frame of the swimmer .",
    "the mathematical justification relies on noting that all terms except the stokeslet in the multipole expansion are exact derivatives @xcite .",
    "enhanced diffusion of the tracers in a swimmer suspension could not occur if the tracers simply moved in closed loops .",
    "however the symmetry argument neglects the lagrangian contribution to the time derivative of the tracer velocity , which arises if the tracer moves across stream lines of the flow . as a result of the lagrangian terms tracers",
    "far from the swimmer gain a net backwards displacement , whereas those close to the swimmer are displaced forwards .",
    "this effect becomes increasingly important for the fast - moving tracers closer to the swimmer . if a swimmer happens to pass so close to a tracer that the latter gains a velocity comparable to that of the swimmer it moves with the swimmer for a while and is said to be entrained along the swimming direction ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .    perhaps surprisingly , the total volume of fluid displaced by the swimmer as it moves along an infinite , straight path takes a simple , universal form @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the volume of the swimmer , @xmath62 is the swimming velocity , and @xmath63 is a quadrupole moment with @xmath64 the @xmath22-component of any force on the surface of the swimmer and @xmath4 the radial co - ordinate .",
    "@xmath65 is termed the darwin drift : by comparison , for a colloid at zero reynolds number this quantity is infinite .",
    "the magnitude of the darwin drift is of the order of the swimmer s volume . also , the characteristic entrainment length is typically of the order of the swimmer s size , @xmath21 .",
    "these considerations allow an order of magnitude estimate of the effective tracer diffusion due to entrainment , @xmath66 , based on a kinetic - theory approach , @xmath67 where we assume a dilute , uncorrelated suspension of swimmers of number density @xmath68 .",
    "+ bacteria do not move along infinite straight paths because of significant rotational diffusion .",
    "indeed some microorganisms , for example _ e. coli _ , have an explicit run and tumble behaviour which allows them to exploit a biassed random walk to move up a nutrient gradient .",
    "a finite swimmer path implies an open tracer loop and hence finite swimmer run lengths provide another important contribution to tracer diffusion .",
    "this can be estimated by using a model system introduced by lin _",
    "their model assumes a uniform and isotropic ensemble of uncorrelated swimmers moving in straight runs of length @xmath69 , followed by instantaneous random changes of swimming direction .",
    "the consecutive runs are assumed to be statistically independent .",
    "assuming @xmath70 this model can be solved exactly to give a contribution to the diffusion constant from random reorientations @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a measure of the swimmer dipole strength . that this result is , surprisingly",
    ", independent of @xmath69 is due to a fortuitous cancellation for 3d dipolar swimmers .    in suspensions of swimmers",
    "both entrainment and random swimmer reorientations will lead to enhanced mixing and it is reasonable to assume , as a first approximation , that their effects add up .",
    "therefore the total diffusion coefficient may be written @xmath73 where the thermal diffusion will depend on the size of the diffusing agents . using values for _ e. coli _ :",

    "( [ entrainment ] ) and ( [ rr ] ) gives @xmath77m@xmath78 and @xmath79m@xmath78 showing that random re - orientations dominate entrainment .",
    "these numbers are in good agreement with the experimental value @xmath80m@xmath78 @xcite .    as an aside",
    "we note that generalisations of these arguments show that for quadrupolar swimmers in 3d and for a 2d suspension of dipolar swimmers ( but with full 3d hydrodynamics ) it is the contribution from entrainment that dominates the diffusion constant .",
    "i am not aware of any theoretical work on swimmers in 2d with 2d hydrodynamics but experiments on bacteria swimming in a film suggest a considerably larger diffusion constant than in 3d @xcite .",

    "+   + zttl and stark @xcite have shown that a simple model swimmer in poiseuille flow can be mapped onto the equation of a non - linear pendulum .",
    "the ( first ) model they consider is a point microswimmer in a 2d poiseuille flow .",

    "writing the swimmer orientation in terms of a polar angle @xmath90 , with the polar axis pointing upstream , @xmath91 the equations of motion in this 2d geometry become @xmath92 where i have rescaled time by @xmath93 .",
    "eliminating @xmath86 gives the pendulum equation @xmath94 recall that the pendulum has two solutions , an oscillation about @xmath95 and a circling solution .",
    "the oscillation corresponds to the swimmer moving upstream against the flow .",
    "any deviation for the centre line is subject to a restoring torque from the vorticity and hence the swimmer trajectory oscillates around the centre of the channel .",
    "swimming downstream any perturbation about the centre line is amplified by the vorticity , and the swimmer tumbles in the flow . for sufficiently large velocities",
    "it continues to tumble downstream , otherwise it reaches the walls and and the simple theory must be supplemented by additional physics .    as a second example consider a point microswimmer in a shear flow @xmath96 such that @xmath97 the swimmer will tumble in the flow and trace out a cycloidal trajectory .",

    "a single defect has an infinite energy in an infinite system , so can only exist due to a boundary or ( real ) defect .",

    "the notation we use here allows us to write the equations in a compact way , but each term encapsulates important details of the hydrodynamics of this viscoelastic fluid .    consider first the evolution of the order parameter field , eq .",

    "liquid crystal molecules rotate in velocity gradients .",
    "this is accounted for by the generalised advection term @xmath129 where @xmath130 are the strain rate and vorticity tensors .",
    "@xmath69 is the alignment parameter which determines whether the collective response of the nematogens to a velocity gradient is dominated by the strain or the vorticity .",
    "the director aligns at a given angle to a shear flow , called the leslie angle , if @xmath131 if this equality is not satisfied the molecules rotate ( tumble ) in the flow . @xmath69 depends on the shape of the particles with @xmath132 and @xmath133 corresponding to rod - like and plate - like particles respectively .",

    "it is a sum of the usual viscous stress @xmath138 and an elastic stress @xmath139 the elastic stress is a second consequence of the anisotropic nature of the liquid crystal molecules .",
    "it occurs because , as the molecules turn they induce a shear flow , often called the ` back - flow ' . in general back - flows",
    "are small , and make a qualitative rather than quantitative difference to the hydrodynamic fields of liquid crystals .",
    "we write down the continuum equations of motion for an active nematic and motive the form of the active term .",
    "we show that vortical flows destabilise the nematic order whereas straining flows can help to increase its magnitude .",
    "+   + a simple extension to the beris - edwards equations suffices to describe an active nematic @xcite .",

    "@xmath142 describes an extensile system and @xmath143 a contractile system .",
    "the form of the active term can be motivated by realising that the contribution to the continuum stress tensor from the dipole terms in the multipole expansion is the averaged stresslet per unit volume @xcite which , from eq .",

    "the relation  ( [ actmapping ] ) makes it apparent that @xmath141 is a measure of the activity , and that the sign of the stress distinguishes extensile ( positive ) and contractile ( negative ) particles .",
    "[ unstableinst ]    many properties of active nematics can be interpreted by noting that the active term appears in the stress , under a derivative , and therefore * any change in the direction or orientation of the nematic order induces a flow*. an immediate consequence is that the active nematic state is unstable to vortical flow @xcite .",
    "the physics behind the instability is illustrated in fig .",
    "6 . for an extensile system a bend perturbation of",
    "the nematic director leads to a flow field indicated by the blue arrows .",
    "these are closer together on the concave side of the bend , a pictorial representation that the flow is stronger here , and thus the resultant flow is as shown by the large black arrows .",
    "this is a rotational flow that tends to turn the director further from its equilibrium position ( fig .",
    "6b ) thus destabilising the nematic state . in a similar way contractile systems are unstable to splay instabilities @xcite .",
    "[ stableinst ]    by contrast extensional flow can tend to stabilise nematic ordering ( fig .  7 ) @xcite .",
    "recall that a rod ( @xmath132 ) attains a stable position in an extensional flow when it is aligned along the extensional axis .",
    "starting from an isotropic configuration of elongated particles consider a fluctuation that induces a small ordering , along a given direction as in fig .  7a .",
    "if the particles are active they generate dipolar flow fields , which enhance the instantaneous order for an extensile system or destabilise it in the contractile case as is apparent from figs .",
    "7b and c respectively .",
    "it can be shown that the response of the @xmath149-tensor to the extensional part of the flow generates an effective molecular potential and , in extensile systems , the hydrodynamics acts as an effective force favouring the alignment of the active rods . for plate - like particles , @xmath133 ,",
    "however , the stable position is along the compressional axis with plate orientation defined normal to the plate .",
    "therefore now it is contractile stress that favours ordering .",
    "since these mechanisms depends only on the extensional part of the flow field , they hold for both aligning and tumbling particles .",
    "we have seen that the active nematic state is unstable to flow and in lecture 4 we describe * active turbulence * , the non - equilibrium steady state that replaces the nematic order .",
    "we first use simulations to motivate our description of the mechanisms driving active turbulence and then describe an experimental system , a mixture of microtubules and molecular motors , where active turbulence is observed .",
    "we discuss active anchoring at an active  passive interface .",

    "it is a state characterised by a flow field with continually changing regions of high vorticity .",
    "hence the name  active turbulence or mesoscale turbulence  that comes about because of a superficial visual resemblance to inertial turbulence .",
    "however the latter is a consequence of high reynolds number ; here we are at low reynolds number and the physics is very different . active turbulence has been observed in a wide range of systems , at different length scales , examples of which are shown in fig .",

    "9b magnifies a small region of this plot to show the director field .",
    "note the bend distortion of the director which induces a stress , and hence a jet - like flow , which creates areas of positive and negative vorticity on either side of the jet .",

    "they are also created in pairs , and they often move away from each other before they can annihilate @xcite . this occurs because defects correspond to distortions in the director field and hence are sources of flow .",
    "the symmetry of the @xmath150 defect implies balanced flows and the defect hardly moves , whereas the @xmath151 defect moves away from the point at which it is created . referring again to fig .",
    "9c note that defects are often associated with lines in the director field .",
    "these are bend walls ; such a wall is shown at increased magnification in fig .",
    "they occur because any bend instability tends to localise to give regions of nematic order separated by a narrow wall .",
    "the walls are regions of high distortion energy and therefore defects form more easily here . when the defects separate they preferentially move along the walls and in doing so they locally restore nematic order",
    ".    the dynamics of the active nematic state is summarised by the cycle in fig .",
    "hydrodynamic instabilities lead to the formation of walls , lines of high bend distortion in the director field .",
    "the elastic energy stored in the walls is released by the creation of pairs of topological defects .",
    "the director distortions that define the defects correspond to active stresses that move the @xmath151 defect away from the @xmath150 one .",
    "defects preferentially move along walls , but can escape from the walls at higher activities , and when oppositely charged defects meet they annihilate . both creation and annihilation events",
    "remove walls and help to reinstate regions of nematic order which then undergo further hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "[ corr ]    the velocity - velocity correlation function in the active turbulent state is plotted in fig .",

    "the correlation functions are scaled so that their value at @xmath152 is unity .",

    "although i have given a description of the physical mechanisms underlying active turbulence a predictive theory is still needed .",
    "moreover there is still much to understand about which features of the active turbulent state are generic across different systems .",
    "for example simulations of self - propelled , non - overlapping rods with an aspect ratio @xmath153 show a state resembling active turbulence @xcite as do vertically vibrated granular layers @xcite .",
    "these are both systems where hydrodynamics is either absent or strongly screened .",
    "a suspension of microtubules driven by molecular motors is an experimental system that displays active turbulence .",
    "+   + molecular motors are the engines of the cell .",
    "they convert chemical energy , often in the form of atp , into mechanical work .",
    "kinesins are a group of motor proteins that move along microtubules through a ` walking ' motion of two heads which are a few nanometres in size .",
    "the heads are linked to a tether which can itself be connected to a cargo .",
    "the motors are designed to move along the microtubule tracks to overcome the strong brownian fluctuations at these length scales .",
    "kinesin takes an 8-nm step for every molecule of atp it hydrolyses , and it always walks towards the head of the microtubule .    microtubules and kinesin molecular motors form the basis of beautiful recent experiments demonstrating active turbulence @xcite .",
    "microtubule filaments with average length @xmath154 m were mixed with kinesin motors connected in clusters .",
    "the kinesin heads from a cluster form bridges between neighbouring filaments and , if the filaments have opposite polarity , they slide relative to each other as the motors walk .",
    "this is shown in fig.11a ; note the dipolar nature of the active forces produced by the motors .",
    "the addition of peg induces depletion interactions that result in the microtubules forming bundles and hence the effects of their relative sliding becomes much more pronounced .",
    "[ motor ]    a 2d active system was created by adsorbing the microtubule - kinesin mixture onto a water - oil interface .",
    "the cellular extract forms an active nematic phase characterised by swirling flows .",
    "the microtubule bundles are stretched by the motor activity and the resulting extended filaments undergo bend instabilities .",
    "this leads to the formation of @xmath155 topological defects that unbind , restoring nematic regions , as shown in fig .",
    "10b shows the velocity - velocity correlation function of the microtubule - kinesin suspension for different atp concentrations , corresponding to different strengths of the activity @xcite .",
    "just as in the simulations the normalised correlation functions collapse onto a single curve , showing that the system has a length scale independent of the activity .",
    "however , although the creation of topological defects and the behaviour of the velocity correlation function agrees well with the model active nematic there are obvious differences between the simulations and the experiments .",
    "for example , the one elastic constant approximation should be relaxed as the microtubule bundles can be bent much more easily than splayed , the microtubules are long and flexible , and the friction of the surrounding fluid is likely to have an effect .",
    "very recent work has unexpectedly shown that the @xmath151 topological defects that are formed in the cellular suspension can themselves have nematic order which is correlated with nematic ordering of the microtubules @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is currently unclear .    in another recent paper kleber _",
    "@xcite created lipid vesicles of diameter about 70 microns and encapsulated microtubules and kinesin which absorbed onto the surface of the vesicle to form an active shell . because of the curvature of the shell the nematic field must include defects .",
    "_ observed four persistent active defects .",
    "the coupling between the velocity fields and the elastic defect - defect interactions led to the defects moving on the surface , oscillating between two symmetric tetrahedral defect states by way of a configuration where all four defects lie in a plane .",
    "the pattern was distorted but not destroyed by thermal fluctuations .",
    "as the flexibility of the encapsulating vesicle was changed it became elliptical , fluctuating in tune with the defect oscillations .",

    "these are not symmetric , but have a distinctive shape with rounded convex regions , and sharper convex cusps .",
    "topological defects of charge @xmath151 form at the cusps , detach , and move into the bulk of the nematic , leaving the interface with a distributed negative topological charge .",
    "note also that the director field tends to lie parallel to the interface ( fig .",
    "there is no term in the free energy that gives a preferential anchoring ; rather the anchoring , which we term active anchoring , is due to active stresses .",

    "( [ activestress ] ) the active force density @xmath167 defining @xmath168 as the outwards unit normal to the surface the force density can be written @xmath169 if we assume that contributions from gradients in the nematic orientation are small compared to those from variations in the magnitude of the nematic order , the components of the active force density tangential and normal to the interface are @xmath170 @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the unit vector tangent to the interface .",
    "when the director does not lie along or perpendicular to the interface @xmath173 is non - zero and generates a flow along the interface . for a flow - tumbling nematic",
    "the resulting velocity gradient between the interface and the bulk nematic has a tendency to rotate the director as dictated by the corotational terms of eq .",

    "( [ normal ] ) , we find that the active force density @xmath175 when @xmath168 and @xmath172 are parallel and @xmath176 when they are perpendicular . thus , for extensile activity ( @xmath142 ) , the drop is extended where the interfacial alignment is parallel to the interface , and compressed where it is perpendicular to the interface , causing an initially circular drop to be stretched along the nematic director . as a result , the director field is oriented parallel to the interface everywhere except at the ends of the elongated structure . in the case of a contractile suspension ,",
    "the forces are reversed , so that the nematic drop extends perpendicular to the nematic director , corresponding to active anchoring perpendicular to the interface .    to motivate the time evolution of the interface shape we now assume active anchoring and take into account gradients of @xmath112 . for the extensile system ( @xmath168 , @xmath112 perpendicular )",
    "the force normal to the interface becomes @xmath177 the first term represents the force arising from the gradient in nematic order , which always acts inwards .",
    "the second term acts inwards on the concave portions of the interface , but outwards where the interface is convex .",
    "thus , in the concave parts , the two force contributions combine to give a strong force that pulls the interface sharply inwards to give high curvature , while in the convex parts , the two contributions are opposed so the resultant force is weak leading to a lower curvature . for a contractile active nematic ,",
    "the interface shape is the same because the change of sign of @xmath141 is cancelled out by the change in active interface alignment from planar to homeotropic .",
    "inevitably a short lecture course contains a finite amount of material , and the choice is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "sections 2 and 4 of these lectures provide a general background , hopefully useful in many contexts , but many other examples could have been covered in sections 3 and 5 .",

    "* active systems : * + we have considered active nematics and concentrated primarily on cases where flow provides the dominant physics . this is only one of many ` active ' models that have been studied since the early work of viczek @xcite and toner and tu @xcite .",

    "we have not considered polar symmetry , where additional terms appear in the continuum equations ( although the active stress remains dipolar ) .",
    "we have ignored density variations and compressibility which are very important in the dry models , and we have neglected inertia which should be included if these ideas are to be applied to macroscopic systems such as schools of fish or animal herds . understanding the similarities and differences between the various active models , and linking them in turn to driven systems is an important goal @xcite .",
    "+ * active machines and active self assembly : * + much research on active matter aims to exploit or imitate the ability of microswimmers and molecular motors to act as efficient machines . we have heard in this school about active colloids which can be propelled by chemical interactions that take place over half the colloid , by anisotropic interactions induced by light , or by electric or magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "more ` swimmer - like ' micromachines taking the form of waving filaments and driven by an external magnetic field have also been constructed @xcite . in an early , and appealing , example of harnessing swimmers to do work sokolov _",
    "_ @xcite and di leonardo _",

    "there are several results for microswimmers moving in a viscoelastic continuum @xcite , but often the host fluid contains biopolymers or colloids of similar size to the bacteria themselves . for example , recent experiments suggest that _ e - coli _ motility in a polymer suspension is affected by local shear - thinning induced by the flagella motion @xcite . living liquid crystals represent a novel system where bacteria swim in a nematic fluid and their motion in the direction perpendicular to the nematic ordering",

    "* biological systems : * + many active systems are living systems and the physical theories of active matter are starting to offer useful insight into biological mechanisms . at a sub - cellular level",
    "the active particles are molecular motors and we described in sec 5.1 how these can drive active turbulence in dense suspensions of microtubules in vitro .",
    "within the cell there are results showing how molecular motors walking along microtubules contribute to cell division resulting from spindle mitosis @xcite , and the interaction of myosin motors with the actin network has been well studied recently @xcite .",

    "the extent to which hydrodynamics ( even at nanometre scales ) affects motor motion @xcite , the way in which multiple motors can combine to move cargo and mechanisms for cargo transport in the crowded cellular environment remain largely unexplored .    at a cellular level",
    "there is increasing evidence that cell motility is linked to the physical environment @xcite .",
    "for example , cells move up a stiffness gradient on a surface , and their rate of division is linked to the local stress . understanding the different physical properties of cancerous cells and the link between these and the motility of malignant cells is a promising direction @xcite . interactions between cells , the spreading of cellular layers and the possible role of flow in morphogenesis are also of interest .",
    "+ to summarise , in these lectures we have emphasised two important features of active swimming at low reynolds number .",
    "firstly at zero reynolds number the scallop theorem constrains the swimmer stroke to be non - invariant under time reversal .",
    "secondly the swimmers move autonomously and therefore can exert no net force or torque on the fluid .",
    "this means that the far flow field is generically dipolar , and its nematic symmetry has far reaching consequences for both how microswimmers stir the surrounding fluid and for their collective behaviour .    as examples of microswimmer hydrodynamics we discussed how swimmers oscillate about the centre line when swimming against a poiseuille flow , swimmer localisation resulting from a competition between gravitaxis and shear , and the interaction of microswimmers with surfaces .",
    "the effect of the dipolar flow field was clear when we considered the loop - like motion of tracer particles due to the flow fields produced by a passing swimmer and distinguished the contributions to tracer diffusion from tracer entrainment , swimmer re - orientations and thermal fluctuations .",
    "in section 4 we moved on to consider the collective behaviour of active nematics .",
    "the equations of motion are the same as those for liquid crystals but with an additional term of dipolar symmetry in the stress tensor .",
    "the active stress results in instabilities which lead to a state termed ` active turbulence ' characterised by high flow vorticity , and walls and topological defects in the director field .",
    "numerical solutions to the equations of motion were compared to recent experiments on mixtures of microtubules and molecular motors .",
    "considering an interface between an active and passive fluid , we discussed the interface instability and active anchoring , alignment of the liquid crystal at the active - passive interface that is driven by flow .",
