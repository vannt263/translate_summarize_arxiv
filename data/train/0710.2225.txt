    "in the local universe , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars are believed to dominate dust production ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "agb stars are a late phase of stellar evolution for stars with initial masses of @xmath9=18@xmath10 , which develop outflows where the low temperatures and high densities become optimal for dust condensation .",
    "however , a significant amount of dust originating from agb stars does not build up within @xmath11  gyr of the birth of the first generation of low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , large quantities of dust are clearly present at these early times : quasar host galaxies at @xmath12 show evidence for 10@xmath13  @xmath10  of dust heated by star formation in their host galaxies as seen in submm and far - infrared emission @xcite .",
    "furthermore , extinction curves for a @xmath14 quasar and grb  050904 ( @xmath15 ) are not consistent with those locally @xcite .",
    "another mechanism for dust production is therefore required , and @xcite explored the possibility that quasar winds might provide environments suitable for efficient dust formation .",
    "they determined that the temperatures and pressures in these regions could reach the values found in cool , dust - producing stars .",
    "the quasar winds are predicted to produce dust masses up to @xmath16 @xmath10  @xcite , implying that the quasar wind may in some cases only account for part of the dust production , and supernovae have been suggested as an alternative source of dust in high - z galaxies @xcite .",
    "quasar outflows are most obviously manifested in broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars .",
    "this population , approximately 20% of optically selected type  1 quasar samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is notable for broad , blueshifted absorption evident in common ultraviolet resonance transitions such as , ly@xmath17 , and .",
    "these p  cygni - type features arise because the observer is looking through an outflowing wind .",
    "bal  quasars  are thus a natural population to consider when investigating the grain properties of dust in the quasar environment . in this letter",
    ", we present a detailed analysis of the mid - infrared spectrum of the luminous bal  quasar , pg  2112@xmath0059 , in order to determine its dust composition .",

    "the spectrum of pg  2112@xmath0059  exhibits the broad emission bands at @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xmath7 m generally ascribed to amorphous silicates ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "complementary to the irs spectrum , we added mid - ir photometry from the literature as compiled by ned ( see figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) . in wavelength regions in common , we found good agreement between ( all observed - frame wavelengths ) 25  _ iras _ data @xcite , 12 and 7.5  _ iso _ data @xcite , and 10  palomar data @xcite . to determine the continuum underlying the dust emission features",

    ", we used an average interstellar profile for the pahs from @xcite .",
    "although they contribute to the 11.2 @xmath7 m feature , the pahs do not reproduce its shape well , and additional opacity from forsterite is needed .",
    "we find that pahs are responsible for @xmath2430% and @xmath2415% for the first and second continuum respectively .",
    "this is consistent with the appearance of the pg  2112@xmath0059  spectrum in the 59 @xmath7 m range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ) .",
    "the 11.2 @xmath7 m resonance in pahs is likely due to neutral molecules , while the features in the 59 @xmath7 m range are predominantly carried by ionized pahs ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath38 is significantly stronger than the prevalent field in the galaxy , @xmath37 decreases , further limiting the amount of pahs contributing to the 11.2 @xmath7 m feature .",
    "the presence of silicates in local agn has been known for many years through resonant absorption at 9.7 and 18 @xmath7 m ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , while more recently , silicate features have also been detected in emission towards several quasars and agn @xcite .    while the spectral appearance of pg  2112@xmath0059  in the infrared clearly requires silicates , it is interesting that oxides appear to be present as well . as a source of opacity , corundum and periclase",
    "cause the 18 @xmath7 m feature to become stronger relative to the 9.7 @xmath7 m resonance , while at the same time , they do fill in the opacity trough between the two silicate resonances ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "corundum also causes a red wing on the 9.7 @xmath7 m resonance , which fits well with the feature as observed in pg  2112@xmath0059 .",
    "this is the first reported detection of periclase and corundum as dust components in a quasar .",
    "the presence of al@xmath1o@xmath2 is not surprising ; it is commonly found in the stellar winds of agb stars ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in thermodynamic equilibrium , corundum ( al@xmath1o@xmath2 )",
    "is expected to condense at @xmath39 k , well above the stability limit for silicates @xcite . in a cooling gas",
    "newly condensed al@xmath1o@xmath2 grains will gradually be covered by silicate layers as the temperature drops , provided the density of the gas does not decrease too rapidly . in cases",
    "where the gas density has become too low for significant dust growth once the gas temperature has reached the stability limits for silicates , a _",
    "freeze - out _ of the dust condensation sequence occurs , and al@xmath1o@xmath2 remains the dominant dust component .",
    "indeed , agb stars with low mass loss rates ( 10@xmath40  10@xmath41 ) contain significant fractions of al@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite , and a decrease in al@xmath1o@xmath2 content is observed with increasing mass loss rate for agb stars in the lmc @xcite .",
    "both the luminosity and presence of silicates in emission in pg  2112@xmath0059  ( rather than absorption ; ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) argue for geometrically associating these grains with the quasar rather than the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "the presence of both corundum and olivines in the spectrum indicate that there is a highly inhomogeneous ",
    "density structure in the dust forming regions as expected from the broad - band spectral modeling of @xcite and the theoretical work of @xcite .",
    "as the gas travels outwards , certain pockets apparently maintain high enough density throughout the cooling process that silicates can be formed on top of the corundum , whereas in lower density regions of the wind the dust condensation sequence gets truncated after the formation of al@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "periclase ( mgo ) has its stability limits @xmath2450 k below the stability limits of mg - rich olivines ( @xmath241100 k ) , but just above the evaporation temperature of fe  the temperature below which fe@xmath42 can be incorporated in the amorphous silicates @xcite . in the thermodynamic equilibrium of a slowly cooling gas ,",
    "mg@xmath1sio@xmath34 would form first , consuming all available gas - phase mg in the process , thus prohibiting the formation of mgo @xcite .",
    "the presence of solid mgo in pg  2112@xmath0059  indicates that the dust forming gas cooled rapidly to a temperature below these stability limits , allowing for the formation of mgo and fe - containing silicates at the same time as the formation of mg@xmath1sio@xmath34 .",
    "the amorphous silicates in pg  2112@xmath0059  have the stoichiometry of a mg - rich olivine .",
    "by using both mg@xmath1sio@xmath34 and mgfesio@xmath34 to fit the spectrum , we have determined that the fe - content of the amorphous silicates is low : mg@xmath43fe@xmath44sio@xmath34 , although using only mg@xmath1sio@xmath34 or mgfesio@xmath34 gives good results , too .",
    "the silicate grains are found to be sub - micron - sized ( at 10 @xmath7 m the opacity of silicates is the same for all grain sizes @xmath45 0.5 @xmath7 m ) , but the data did not allow us to distinguish between spherical or non - spherical grains .",
    "these results compare well to the silicates in the galactic interstellar medium , which are composed of spherical olivine grains @xcite , or even more general , of non - spherical mg - rich olivines @xcite .",
    "attempts to determine the silicate properties in active galaxies include a fit to the 9.7 @xmath7 m absorption feature seen in ngc  1068 , which shows evidence for the presence of al - bearing species , either in the form of aluminum - silicates or corundum , giving rise to a red wing to the silicate resonance @xcite , while @xcite notice that the 9.7 and 18 @xmath7 m emission features seen in ngc  3998 have a different spectral appearance than the silicates in the galactic ism .",
    "in particular , the 18 @xmath7 m feature is very strong with respect to the 9.7 @xmath7 m feature , and the peak positions of the resonances deviate as well .",
    "we suggest that in ngc  3998 , as well as in some quasars @xcite , the broad ` silicate ' features might be more accurately modeled with a mixture of silicates , corundum and mgo , not unlike pg  2112@xmath0059 .",
    "a fraction of ( 5@xmath463)% by weight of the silicates is found to be crystalline .",
    "evidence of crystalline silicates is not reported in any other silicate emission spectra seen in quasars or agn , though a feature seen at 11.2 @xmath7 m in some objects is identified with pahs , supported by the detection of additional pah resonances at 6.2 and 7.7 @xmath7 m @xcite .",
    "we only ascribe a small fraction of the emission around 11.2 @xmath7 m to pahs ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : feat ] ) .",
    "crystalline silicates are not detected in the interstellar medium of our own galaxy ( @xmath47 wt.% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , due to radiation damage caused by cosmic rays on a time scale of 40 myr . in quasars",
    ", the times scales may be even shorter if the cosmic ray flux is higher , and crystalline silicates need to be reformed continuously to explain the observed abundance .",
    "the formation of crystalline silicates requires higher densities than amorphous silicates .",
    "a quasar wind origin may explain the presence of crystalline silicates in a relatively small fraction ( 12 out 77 ) of ultraluminous infrared galaxies @xcite .",
    "for the first time , the composition of the dust in a quasar has been determined , albeit limited to the components with resonances in the infrared .",
    "while the origin of the dust could lie in stellar ejecta , the dust properties are consistent with their formation in the quasar wind itself .",
    "the dust in pg  2112@xmath0059  clearly bears similarity to dust in other astrophysical environments , i.e.  in the properties of the amorphous silicates , but the presence of large amounts of mgo and al@xmath1o@xmath2 sets it apart from the composition of interstellar dust in the local universe .    assuming the dust is formed in the quasar wind , the co - existence of the highly refractory corundum , the crystalline silicates and and the less refractory mgo and amorphous silicates indicates that the wind of pg  2112@xmath0059  has an inhomogeneous temperature and density structure .",
