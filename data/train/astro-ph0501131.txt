    "binary stars play a fundamental role in the evolution of globular clusters for at least two important reasons .",
    "first , the evolution of stars in binaries , whether in a cluster or in the galactic field , can be very different from the evolution of the same stars in isolation . in a dense environment like a globular cluster ,",
    "this difference is exacerbated by dynamical encounters , which affect binaries much more than single stars .",
    "second , binary stars crucially affect the dynamical evolution of globular clusters , providing ( through inelastic collisions ) the source of energy that supports them against gravothermal collapse @xcite . in the `` binary burning '' phase",
    ", a cluster can remain in quasi - thermal equilibrium with nearly constant core density and velocity dispersion for many relaxation times , in a similar way to that in which a star can maintain itself in thermal equilibrium for many kelvin - helmholtz times by burning hydrogen in its core . the binary fraction",
    "( and the initial , primordial binary fraction in particular ) , is therefore one of the most important parameters that determine the evolution of globular clusters .",
    "however , most previous dynamical studies of globular clusters  even those including binaries  have neglected stellar evolution , which can significantly impact the properties and survival of binaries and hence the reservoir of energy they provide .    at present , there are very few direct measurements of binary fractions in clusters .",
    "however , even early observations showed that binary fractions in globular cluster cores are smaller than in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recent hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations have provided further constraints on the binary fractions in many globular clusters @xcite .",
    "the measured binary fractions in dense cluster cores are found to be _ very small_. as an example , the upper limit on the core binary fraction of ngc 6397 is only 5 - 7% @xcite . on the other hand , in very sparse clusters , like",
    "ngc 288 @xcite , but also in some other `` core - collapsed '' clusters , like ngc 6752 @xcite , the upper limit for the binary fraction can be as high as @xmath1 .",
    "for the _ initial _ binary fraction in globular clusters , there are of course no direct measurements . however , there are no observational or theoretical arguments suggesting that the formation of binaries and hierarchical multiples in dense stellar systems should be significantly different from other environments like open clusters , the galactic field , or star - forming regions .",
    "binary frequencies @xmath2 are found in the solar neighborhood and in open clusters .",
    "t tauri stars also have a very high binary fraction @xcite .",
    "for the range of separations between 120 and 1800 au , their binary fraction is comparable to that of main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood , while at shorter periods it is higher .",
    "furthermore , many stars are formed in systems of multiplicity 3 or higher : in the field their abundance is no less than 40% for inner periods @xmath3 days @xcite .",
    "all this suggests that , in dense stellar systems as well , most stars could be formed in binary and multiple configurations .",
    "most dynamical interactions in dense cluster cores tend to _ destroy _ binaries ( the possible exception is tidal capture , which may form binaries , but turns out to play a negligible role ; see   5.2 ) .",
    "soft binaries ( with orbital speeds lower than the cluster velocity dispersion ) can be disrupted easily by any strong encounter with another passing star or binary .",
    "even hard binaries can be destroyed in resonant binary  binary encounters , which typically eject two single stars and leave only one binary remaining @xcite , or produce physical stellar collisions and mergers @xcite .",
    "in addition , many binary stellar evolution processes lead to disruptions ( e.g. , following a supernova explosion of one of the stars ) or mergers ( e.g. , following a common envelope phase ) .",
    "these evolutionary destruction processes can also be enhanced by dynamics .",
    "for example , more common envelope systems form as a result of exchange interactions @xcite , and the orbital shrinkage and the development of high eccentricities through hardening encounters may lead to the coalescence of binary components @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether the small binary fractions measured in old globular clusters today result from these many destruction processes , and what the _ initial binary fraction _ must have been to explain the current numbers .",
    "we address these questions in this paper by performing calculations that combine binary star evolution with a treatment of dynamical interactions in dense cluster cores . in ",
    "3 we describe in detail the method we use , following a brief overview of the theoretical background in   2 .",
    "we test our simplified dynamical model by comparing it against full monte carlo @xmath0-body simulations in   4.1 . in ",
    "4.2 we use semi - analytical estimates to predict the upper limit for the final binary fraction in dense clusters . in ",
    "4.3 we estimate the lower limit for the final binary fraction and analyse which mechanisms of binary destruction are most efficient as a function of cluster age . in   5",
    "we present our numerical results for the evolution of the binary fraction in dense cluster cores , and we compare these results with observations . in particular , using our theoretically predicted period distribution , we re - examine observations of 47  tuc and re - derive constraints on the core binary fraction . in the final discussion (   6 ) , we point out how our results may be helpful in interpreting observations of core binary fractions in other clusters , and we discuss the required initial conditions for simulations of clusters with binaries , as well as which methods are best suited for these simulations .",
    "there are several possible ways to approach the study of binary evolution in dense clusters .",
    "the traditional approach is to start from full @xmath0-body simulations to study the dynamics of the stellar system and introduce on top of this various simplified treatments of single and binary star evolution .",
    "this has been used for many years . unfortunately ,",
    "even with the fastest special - purpose computers available today , this direct @xmath0-body approach remains extremely expensive computationally , so that previous studies have been limited to small systems like open clusters and with limited coverage of parameter space .",
    "in addition , because binaries are particularly expensive to handle computationally ( as they increase enormously the dynamic range of direct @xmath0-body simulations ) , these previous studies have also been performed with unrealistically small numbers of binaries .",
    "for example , the time required to perform just one direct @xmath0-body simulation of a cluster containing @xmath4  stars with all stars formed initially in binaries would be at least a year on the grape-6 , with some dependence on the initial binary parameters    alternatively , a binary population synthesis code ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , normally used to evolve large numbers of stars and binaries without dynamical interactions , can be extended by introducing a simple treatment of dynamics . in this type of approach",
    "it is often assumed that all the relevant parameters of the cluster ( e.g. , central density and velocity dispersion ) remain constant throughout each dynamical simulation , i.e. , the dynamics is assumed to take place in a _",
    "fixed background _ cluster .",
    "many previous studies of dense stellar systems have been based on this type of approximation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this approach , sometimes called `` encounter rate technique '' @xcite , is computationally much less expensive than direct @xmath0-body simulations and hence allows the systematic exploration of the vast parameter space of initial conditions for clusters and their primordial binary populations .",
    "in addition , the use of sufficiently large numbers of stars and binaries makes the simulations more realistic .",
    "although obviously much less accurate in its description of the overall cluster dynamics , this method opens the possibility of studying `` star cluster ecology '' in considerably greater detail than has been possible with @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "in particular , it makes it possible to study in detail the rare but important evolutionary channels that may play a crucial role in the formation of some of the most interesting tracers of dynamical interactions in dense clusters , such as ultracompact x - ray binaries , millisecond pulsars , and cataclysmic variables @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to compare these two approaches , as each is based on a very different set of simplifying assumptions .",
    "there are no comprehensive studies of dense stellar systems including a self - consistent treatment of both dynamics and binary star evolution .",
    "in many recent @xmath0-body simulations for large clusters , binary stars are treated in the point mass limit and soft binaries are eliminated from the start .",
    "binary destruction can then occur only through resonant 4-body interactions .",
    "however , @xmath0-body studies of open clusters that incorporate realistic treatments of binary stellar evolution have shown that stellar evolution affects the binaries significantly , and that , even in these low - density environments , the complex interplay between binary evolution and dynamics , even for soft binaries , can play an important role in the overall cluster evolution and in determining the properties of surviving binaries @xcite .    the second approach , `` binary population synthesis with dynamics '' , which we have adopted in this work , suffers from the lack of self - consistent dynamical evolution of the cluster , which is assumed to remain in a constant state of thermal equilibrium for its entire evolution .",
    "this state , where the energy production through `` binary burning '' in the core is balanced by the outer energy flux into the cluster halo , does indeed provide nearly constant conditions throughout a typical globular cluster s lifetime .",
    "the exception might be `` core - collapsed '' clusters , which may have run out of binaries and evolved to a much more centrally concentrated state .",
    "typically , the density and `` temperature '' profiles of a cluster do not change much as long as there are enough binaries remaining to provide support against gravothermal contraction .",
    "stellar interiors provide a useful analogy : as long as a star keeps enough hydrogen to burn in its core , it can remain in thermal equilibrium on the main sequence and avoid core contraction and envelope expansion . just like main - sequence stars",
    ", globular clusters can maintain a nearly constant interior structure for many thermal time - scales ( i.e. , many relaxation times ) as long as they do not run out of `` fuel '' ( binaries ) .",
    "this behavior is expected qualitatively ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and has now been demonstrated quantitatively in many different studies using various numerical techniques for cluster simulations .",
    "for example , the recent study by @xcite considered the evolution of idealized clusters of equal - mass stars without stellar evolution for a range of initial binary fractions . for the case of an isolated plummer model with 10% initial hard binaries they found ( see their fig .",
    "4 ) that the core radius of this cluster can remain nearly constant ( to within a factor @xmath5 ) for many tens of half - mass relaxation times ( i.e. , more than a hubble time for most galactic globular clusters , where the half - mass relaxation time is @xmath6 yr ) . for a more realistic cluster model with 20% hard binaries initially and tidal truncation , they found that , after about @xmath7 , when the cluster is about to disrupt in the galactic tidal field , the core radius still has not varied by more than a factor @xmath5 over the entire evolution ( see their fig .",
    "11 ) ; and over the first @xmath8 , the core radius changed by less than @xmath9 .",
    "the central velocity dispersion also does not vary much with time ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  1 ) .",
    "similar results have been obtained from direct @xmath0-body simulations of open clusters , where the central density and velocity dispersion also remain nearly constant in models with significant numbers of binaries @xcite .",
    "there are several binary population synthesis codes in use today .",
    "only a few of them include , in addition to detailed treatment of mass transfer phases , stellar evolution along with tidal interaction of binary components .",
    "the code of @xcite was designed to study low- and intermediate - mass stars leading to the formation of white dwarf systems .",
    "the code of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* in preparation ) was originally developed to investigate more massive stars ",
    "progenitors of neutron star and black hole systems ( calibrated against full binary stellar evolution codes for mass - transfer phases)and was expanded recently to treat carefully binaries with white dwarfs as well .",
    "we use the latter code ( called startrack ) to follow the evolution of single and binary stars in our simulations .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we also treat all dynamical encounters explicitly by direct integration , using a recently developed numerical toolkit for small-@xmath0 gravitational dynamics that is particularly well suited to performing 3-body and 4-body integrations @xcite .",
    "our initial conditions are described by the following parameters : total number of stars @xmath0 ( single or in a binary ) , initial mass function ( imf ) , binary fraction @xmath10 , distribution of binary parameters ( period , @xmath11 , eccentricity , @xmath12 , and mass ratio , @xmath13 ) .",
    "we typically adopt standard choices used in previous population synthesis studies , which are based on available observations for stars in the field and in young star clusters ( sills et al .",
    "2003 ) . for most of the calculations",
    "reported here , we use the following `` standard '' initial conditions :    * we adopt the imf of @xcite , which can be written as a broken power law @xmath14 , where @xmath15 for @xmath16 , @xmath17 for @xmath18 , @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that all stars are formed in a single burst of star formation at @xmath21 in our simulations .",
    "* we consider a wide range of stellar masses from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "] * the binary mass ratio , @xmath24 , is assumed to be distributed uniformly in the range @xmath25 .",
    "this is in agreement with observations for @xmath26 @xcite . * the binary period , @xmath11 ,",
    "is taken from a uniform distribution in @xmath27 over the range @xmath28@xmath29d . *",
    "the binary eccentricity , @xmath12 , follows a thermal distribution with probability density @xmath30 .",
    "* we reject systems where binary components would overflow their roche lobe at pericenter .",
    "the initial average stellar mass is then @xmath31 , and , with the flat mass ratio distribution , the average binary mass is @xmath32 .",
    "we evolve all stars ( single and binary ) using the population synthesis code startrack @xcite , which has recently been updated significantly ( * ? ? ?",
    "* in preparation ) .",
    "this is the only current population synthesis code that incorporates detailed treatments of all possible types of mass transfer ( mt ) episodes : stable mt ( conservative or non - conservative ) , unstable mt ( thermally or dynamically ) , and thermal time - scale mt .",
    "also included are the effects of eddington - limited mass accretion and transient behavior of accretion discs ( based on the disc instability model ) .",
    "startrack allows us to follow the evolution of binaries with a large range of stellar masses , metallicities , and star formation histories ( constant rate , sudden or exponential bursts , etc . ) .",
    "startrack also models in detail the loss of mass and angular momentum through stellar winds ( dependent on metallicity ) and gravitational radiation , asymmetric core collapse events with a realistic spectrum of compact object masses , and the effects of magnetic braking and tidal circularization on close binaries . in our simulations",
    ", we adopted the new prescription for magnetic braking given by @xcite .",
    "compared to the older prescription closer binaries lose their angular momentum at a slower rate and hence survive as binaries longer .",
    "the evolution of single stars in startrack is based on the analytic fits provided by @xcite , but includes a more realistic determination of compact object masses @xcite .",
    "we treat the evolution of stellar collision and binary merger products following the general `` rejuvenation '' prescription of @xcite .",
    "it ensures that the merger product has the same total amount of hydrogen , helium , and carbon as the two parent stars together .",
    "for some stars , the assumptions made in the treatment of the merger depend on the types of stars and the type of merger ( collision vs binary coalescence ) .",
    "for example , we assume that there is no accretion on to a neutron star during a physical collision , and that the other star , if it is unevolved , is destroyed completely ( e.g. , we do not consider the possible formation of a thorne - hytkow object ) .",
    "we treat as a `` dynamical common envelope '' ( ce ) event the outcome of a physical collision between a compact object and a red giant , applying a standard `` alpha prescription '' ( where we adopt @xmath33 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but taking into account the initial positive energy .",
    "in particular , if this compact object is a neutron star , a compact binary containing a neutron star and a white dwarf is formed .",
    "we assume that , during the ce phase , the neutron star will accrete a significant amount of the envelope material and will become a millisecond pulsar @xcite .",
    "if the resulting mass of the neutron star exceeds the limit for a neutron star ( taken in our simulations to be @xmath34 ) , we assume that a black hole is formed .",
    "to evolve the cluster population of single stars and binaries in our code , we consider two basic time - scales .",
    "one is associated with the evolutionary changes in the stellar population , @xmath35 , and the other with the rate of encounters , @xmath36 ( see   3.4 ) .",
    "the evolution timestep @xmath35 is computed so that no more than 2% of all stars change their properties ( mass and radius ) by more than 5% .",
    "the global timestep for the cluster evolution is taken to be @xmath37 $ ]      as we described in   2 , our model for the cluster dynamics",
    "is highly simplified .",
    "we adopt a simple two - zone , core - halo model for the cluster .",
    "we assume that the core number density , @xmath38 , and one - dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath39 , as well as the half - mass relaxation time , @xmath40 , remain strictly constant throughout the evolution .",
    "while dense globular clusters of interest have @xmath41 , the core density can vary by several orders of magnitude . here",
    "we set @xmath42 for most calculations , representative of a fairly dense cluster like 47  tuc . in general , @xmath38 is the main `` knob '' that we can turn to increase or decrease the importance of dynamics .",
    "setting @xmath43 corresponds to a traditional population synthesis simulation , where all binaries and single stars evolve in isolation after a single initial burst of star formation . to model a specific cluster , we match its core mass density today , @xmath44 , central velocity dispersion , and half - mass relaxation time",
    "the escape speed from the cluster core can be estimated from observations as @xmath45 @xcite , where @xmath46 is the three - dimensional central velocity dispersion . following an interaction or a supernova explosion , any object that has acquired a recoil speed exceeding @xmath47",
    "is removed from the simulation . acquiring a large recoil velocity in a dynamical encounter is a very efficient mechanism for ejecting low - mass objects from the cluster .",
    "we find generally that recoil to the halo does not play a significant role : the recoil velocity into the halo differs by @xmath48 from the escape velocity from the cluster , and affects only a small number of objects .    for computing interactions in the core ,",
    "the velocities of all objects are assumed to be distributed according to a lowered maxwellian @xcite , with @xmath49,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 ( assuming energy equipartition in the core ) and @xmath47 is the escape speed . here",
    "@xmath51 is the average mass of an object in the core .",
    "in addition , we use @xmath52 to impose a cut - off for soft binaries entering the core : any binary with maximum orbital speed @xmath53 is immediately broken into two single stars @xcite .    in the presence of a broad mass spectrum , the cluster core is always dominated by the most massive objects in the cluster , which tend to concentrate there via mass segregation .",
    "as stars evolve , the _ composition _ of the core will therefore change significantly over time .",
    "mass segregation in globular clusters was investigated recently in @xcite by considering both light and heavy tracers in two - component models .",
    "it was found that the characteristic mass - segregation time - scale is given by @xmath54 here @xmath55 is a constant of order unity and @xmath56 is the average mass of an object in the halo , and @xmath57 is the current mass of the object .",
    "this equation represents a diffusion process and can be applied to all stars , not just to those more massive than average . indeed , even low - mass objects may ( rarely ) diffuse into the cluster core on a long time - scale , although on average they will tend to drift outwards .",
    "however , for very light objects with masses @xmath58 ( which is typically @xmath59 at the beginning and @xmath60 after @xmath61gyr ) , this expression becomes less accurate , although it remains valid qualitatively . for a more recent discussion of mass segregation in the presence of a broad mass spectrum ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "to model mass segregation in our simulations , we adopted the time - scale given by equation  ( [ t_sc ] ) , but treated the process as stochastic : the probability for an object of mass @xmath57 to enter the core after a time @xmath62 is sampled from a poisson distribution , @xmath63 this treatment ensures that all stars heavier than @xmath64 diffusing into the core will have the appropriate mass spectrum and that interactions will occur between objects drawn from the correct distribution .",
    "( [ t_sc ] ) was derived for the restricted case of a two - component cluster  without a realistic imf  therefore @xmath55 is unknown by a factor of a few .",
    "we find in simulations that the final core mass is nearly proportional to @xmath65 . in order to obtain a better fit to observations for the core mass versus total cluster mass relation",
    ", we have fine - tuned eq .",
    "( [ t_sc ] ) using data for 47  tuc , in particular the ratio of the core mass to the total mass of the cluster . for this cluster",
    "we adopted a core mass of @xmath66 and a total cluster mass of @xmath67 at present @xcite ; we also take @xmath68 yr @xcite and an age of @xmath69gyr .",
    "while the core mass can be found directly from our simulations , the total cluster mass has an uncertainty due to the imf cut - off at the low mass end in our standard cluster model .",
    "first , we found the total mass of a cluster model evolved to @xmath69gyr and the initial number of very massive stars ( defined as those producing a black hole at the end of their stellar evolution ) .",
    "we find that at 11 gyr , the cluster has @xmath70 per black hole ( or per heavy primordial star ) , when the imf extends down to 0.01 @xmath71 .",
    "this allows us to normalize our model to the real cluster mass : with this ratio we have an estimate for the total cluster mass when we use a higher cut - off for the imf ( 0.05 @xmath71 ) .",
    "this now gives us the ratio of the core mass to the total cluster mass corresponding to our simulations .",
    "we find that the best fit for 47 tuc gives @xmath72 .",
    "all objects in our simulations are allowed to have dynamical interactions only after they have entered the cluster core .",
    "we use a simple monte carlo prescription to decide which pair of objects actually have an interaction during each timestep .    the cross section for an encounter between two objects , of masses @xmath73 and @xmath74 , with relative velocity at infinity @xmath75 ,",

    "the result is striking : most of the very hard binaries , with hardness ratios @xmath139 , are destroyed by stellar evolution .",

    "destructions in binaries of smaller masses are not much different from more massive binaries at small periods , but are not destroyed through sn explosions at large periods .",
    "also , the ce event in less massive binaries occurs when the donor is a less evolved giant ( at the first red giant branch ) .",
    "one may expect that destruction rates should vary smoothly ; however , binary evolution involves many qualitatively different events .",
    "in particular , an interesting fluctuation in destruction rates can be seen at @xmath145 and @xmath146 , where local destruction rates are lower than for nearby binaries . for these and",
    "nearby binaries the destruction rates are about the same for mass ratio @xmath147 but different for larger @xmath24 . for binaries of masses close to and smaller than these ,",

    "this mt is unstable and leads to a merger .",
    "this , therefore , provides for a small local decrease in destruction rates .    with our imf and",
    "considering binaries of all masses , the fraction of hard binaries destroyed during their evolution is 20% . among binaries where at least one star is more massive than @xmath123",
    "the destruction fraction is 50% , and for those with total initial mass above @xmath111 , this fraction is closer to 60% .",
    "the fraction of hard binaries that is not destroyed but is instead softened by evolution is very small , @xmath150 . in  4.3",
    "we will discuss in more detail how binary destruction rates change with time .",
    "therefore , even before any dynamical processes are considered for the hard binary population , we estimate that the final binary fraction can not be higher than about 50% , and for binaries with at least one star more massive than @xmath123 this upper limit becomes 30% .",
    "for relatively massive binaries , with total initial mass above @xmath111 , the upper limit for @xmath120 is only 24% .",
    "overall , this estimate already shows that ( i ) the expected final binary fraction in a dense star cluster will be low and ( ii ) stellar evolution can not be neglected when estimating binary fractions from dynamical models of dense star clusters .",
    "let us now consider the effects of dynamical interactions . the time - scale for a binary to undergo a strong encounter with another single star , the collision time , can be estimated as @xmath151 .",
    "assuming that the strong encounter occurs when the distance of closest approach @xmath152 with @xmath153 , we obtain    @xmath154    here @xmath155 is the mass of an average single star in @xmath71 , @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the relative velocity at infinity and @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the number density . using eq .",

    "overall , with our imf , @xmath164 of all hard binaries have collision times shorter than @xmath165gyr ( see also fig .",
    "[ fate_2d ] ) , and 15% have collision times as short as @xmath166gyr .",
    "in addition , most of the hard binaries that could have experienced an encounter are binaries with @xmath167 , and therefore they are from the population that is destroyed by stellar evolution to a lesser degree than binaries harder than @xmath168 . while this estimate considered only binary ",
    "single encounters , binary  binary encounters will further enhance the destruction rate .",
    "moreover , when the binary fraction is higher than @xmath169 , binary  binary encounters dominate over binary  single encounters .",
    "each binary  single encounter with a hard binary can result in a hardening of this binary , an exchange of a companion with a more massive single star , or binary destruction in a physical collision .",
    "the probability of a physical collision during an encounter increases strongly as the binary becomes harder @xcite .",
    "in addition , a very hard binary can be ejected from the core if its recoil velocity exceeds the escape speed from the cluster .",
    "each of these three processes , directly or indirectly , leads to the depletion of binaries ( immediate or delayed ) : acquiring a more massive companion , as well as orbital shrinkage or the eccentricity increase , makes systems more likely be destroyed through stellar evolution . as a conservative lower limit , we assume that half of the interacting hard binaries will be destroyed as a result of an encounter ( immediately or later ) .",
    "this is clearly a lower limit , as scattering experiments show that , for hard binaries containing main - sequence stars most encounters will lead to a physical collision @xcite .    taking everything into account",
    ", we conclude that 64% of all binaries will be destroyed  only @xmath170 of primordial binaries can survive to the present .",

    "we adopted a velocity dispersion @xmath179 km / s and evolved the system for 14 gyr .",
    "this is an even simpler model of a star cluster , where all objects are effectively inside the `` core '' at all times and the effects of mass segregation and diffusion between a core and a halo are completely ignored .",
    "it allows us to study more clearly the various types of dynamical interactions as separate processes .",
    "we ran a sequence of simulations , with ( i ) only binary ",

    "we also eliminated from the system any object that acquired a recoil speed exceeding the escape velocity @xmath180 .    in ",
    "[ sec : semianalytic ] we estimated that , with only binary  single encounters taken into account , the final binary fraction should not exceed @xmath181 .",
    "this assumed that all objects in the core had a mass equal to the average mass @xmath123 . with the complete imf ,",
    "a single star participating in the encounter can have mass higher than @xmath123 .",
    "also , a fraction of initially hard binaries can become soft during the evolution , e.g. , because of mass loss . as a result",
    ", we obtain even lower remaining binary fractions : @xmath182 for case  ( i ) and @xmath183 for case  ( ii ) .",
    "these numbers are in agreement with the upper limits we estimated in   [ sec : semianalytic ] .",
    "when binary  binary encounters are taken into account , the result is even more dramatic : we obtain @xmath184 and @xmath185 for cases  ( iii ) and  ( iv ) , respectively .",

    "binary encounters further enhance the binary destruction rate .",
    "when all dynamical processes are taken into account , in case  ( v ) , we obtain a final binary fraction @xmath186 .",
    "while our semi - analytical estimate of the binary fraction provided an upper limit , the result obtained in this section is clearly a lower limit : in a real cluster , not all binaries will be exposed to the high interaction rates of the core at all times . however , since more massive objects are more likely to diffuse into the core , and since their destruction rate can be higher than for objects of average mass , this lower limit is only approximate , but we may expect it to be much closer to the real value than our previous , conservative upper limit .",
    "let us now consider in detail which mechanisms of binary destruction are most important . in fig .",
    "[ dr_field ] we show the rates of binary destruction ( events per binary per gyr ) for a field population ( with no interactions ) . except for the interval between @xmath187 and @xmath188 years , when black holes and neutron stars are formed , the binary destructions are mainly coming from mergers .",
    "the power - law behavior observed for the overall destruction rate at late times is on the one hand imposed by the rate of orbital decay driven by magnetic braking , and on the other hand depends on the evolutionary time - scale for the companion to become a red giant .    in fig .",
    "[ dr_core ] we show the binary destruction rates again , but for the dense environment . during the first few gyr the main destruction mechanism is the dynamical disruption of soft binaries .",
    "the rate of disruption through stellar evolution is smaller than in the field population : some massive binaries are destroyed by dynamical encounters before they evolve to a supernova explosion .",
    "however , the rate of evolutionary mergers is about the same as for the field for the first @xmath189 years .",
    "this is consistent with our estimate for the collision time of hard binaries : at this time , hard binaries have not yet been hardened significantly by dynamical encounters .",
    "after @xmath190yr the rate of binary evolutionary mergers is increased compared to the field population , as the dynamical hardening of hard binaries has now started .",
    "the rates for binary destruction through mergers and physical collisions are very similar : in most cases , if a binary is tight enough for an evolutionary merger , the most likely outcome of a dynamical interaction is a physical collision .    at about 5 gyr ,",
    "the rate of binary destruction through physical collisions starts dominating over dynamical disruptions : at this stage , almost no soft binaries are left , and the hard binaries are more likely to lead to physical collisions during an encounter .",
    "consider a binary with @xmath191 at this stage . from equation  ( [ coll ] ) we can find that a collision time of @xmath192gyr corresponds typically to binary components of @xmath193 and @xmath22 ( assuming an average mass ratio of 0.5 and average field mass as @xmath123 ) .",
    "this binary is clearly at the lowest - mass end of our imf , and therefore by this time almost all soft binaries in the simulation have been destroyed . on the other hand , consider some more massive binary , which has evolved through about half of its main - sequence lifetime , and has component masses of @xmath194 and @xmath195 ( and still the same collision time of 5 gyr ) .",

    "note that the period range of eclipsing binaries is near the peak of the distribution , while for longer periods the number of binaries drops rapidly .",
    "in particular , if we concentrate on the binaries consistent with the observed set , with primary masses @xmath213 and @xmath214 , we find that the number of systems with periods in the range @xmath207d to @xmath210yr is about 6 times smaller than would be predicted by adopting a distribution flat in @xmath208 . for the whole period range from @xmath209d to @xmath210yr we have 2.2 times fewer binary systems compared to the flat distribution .",
    "if we take into account this depletion of wider binaries when modelling the number of observed eclipsing binaries in 47  tuc , we are led to revise the observed core binary fraction from @xcite to @xmath215 , which is much closer to our theoretical prediction .",
    "we performed three additional simulations for 47  tuc , with @xmath216 , 0.5 , and 0.75 .",
    "the corresponding core binary fraction extrapolated from observations ( corrected as above ) does not vary much among these different models .",
    "its maximum value is obtained for @xmath217 , which gives a core binary fraction of about 8% , and in this case the total number of binary systems is 1.6 times less than with an assumed flat distribution .",
    "an alternative estimate of the binary fraction in the core of 47  tuc is based on observations of by  dra stars @xcite .",
    "their estimated core binary fraction , which can be considered a _",
    "lower limit _ , is approximately 0.8% , 18 times lower than the estimate based on eclipsing binaries .",
    "this estimate was based on 31 by  dra binaries ( observed in the period range 0.410 d ) and 5 eclipsing binaries ( period range 416 d ) .",
    "we analysed the core binary population in our model in order to identify by  dra systems and eclipsing binaries , and considering the ratio of the two .",
    "we adopted the standard definition for a by  dra binary : primary mass in the range @xmath218@xmath219 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and period in the range @xmath220@xmath221d ( as for the observed sample in 47  tuc ) .",
    "for eclipsing binaries we adopted the observed period range 416 d with each star @xmath222 .",
    "the ratio between the number of by  dra systems and the number of eclipsing binaries is found to be 5.9 , 6.7 , 7.2 and 3.5 for models with @xmath223 and 0.25 , respectively .",
    "therefore a large initial binary fraction @xmath224 is most likely .    of the quantities that we explicitly assume in our cluster model to be constant",
    ", the central ( core ) density is the one with the largest dynamic range in models that provide for dynamical evolution .",
    "hence it is also the quantity that is most likely to significantly affect our final results . to test the sensitivity of our results to a changing central density",

    "specifically , we still match the currently observed core density while ramping up the value either exponentially or linearly in time , starting with a value 10 times smaller than at present .",
    "this could represent qualitatively the gradual core contraction observed in some @xmath0-body models of star clusters with binaries ( see * ? ? ? * and , for a steeper core contraction ,",
    "see giersz & spurzem 2003 ) .",
    "these models predict a present - day core binary fraction that is only slightly higher , by about 12% . to increase the binary fraction more significantly ,",
    "the time - averaged core density in the cluster would have had to be many orders of magnitude lower than what is observed today .",
    "there is no reasonable dynamical history that would produce such an unusual result .",
    "in contrast , recent @xmath0-body simulations show that the presence of just 10% hard primordial binaries leads to core radius _ expansion _ and therefore the core density might be higher in the past ( wilkinson et al .",
    "though we did not run another 47  tuc model with a central density decreasing with time , we can predict that the present - day binary fraction would then be smaller by about 12% .",
    "we have considered in detail processes of binary destruction ( and formation ) in dense stellar systems . in particular , we have shown that the present binary fraction in cluster cores should be relatively small ( @xmath225 ) .",
    "this is caused not only by dynamical encounters , but also binary stellar evolution , which is the dominant mechanism for the destruction of hard binaries .",
    "we also find that the destruction rate due to stellar evolution is enhanced significantly by dynamical hardening of binaries .",
    "we have shown that values of binary fractions for stars in different mass ranges and at different evolutionary stages can differ significantly .",
    "the fraction of dynamically formed binaries is higher when one considers stars at more advanced evolutionary stages .",
    "the binary period distribution evolves from flat in @xmath208 for loose clusters toward a sharply peaked distribution in denser clusters , even if all clusters have identical velocity dispersions and therefore identical hard - soft binary boundaries .",
    "this implies that a flat period distribution should not be assumed when deriving overall binary fractions by extrapolation from the distribution of observed binaries in a narrow period range ( e.g. , eclipsing binaries ) .",
    "we considered several models that attempted to match observed globular clusters . for those with good available data on binaries ( m4 and 47  tuc ) , we found our predicted binary fractions to be in good agreement with observations once we take into account the correct binary period distribution .",
    "the main conclusion we derive from these calculations and our semi - analytic estimates is that the currently observed binary fractions in cluster cores suggest very high initial ( primordial ) binary fractions  close to 100% .",
