    "the digital media is an important component of our lives .",
    "nowadays , digital records of human activity of different sorts are systematically stored and made accessible for academic research .",
    "hence a huge amount of data became available on the past couple of decades , which allows for a quantitative study of human behaviour .",
    "for a long time , scholars from different backgrounds have been studying this field : a more general approach by sociologists , and some specific studies by economists and social psychologists .",
    "however , some very interesting - and elemental - properties have remained outside the grasp of the research studies for lack of reliable massive stored data .",
    "the increasing amount of data that is being gathered in this digital age is progressively opening up new possibilities for quantitative studies of these features .",
    "one such aspect , detected by means of data - gathering , is human bursty behaviour , that is the mankind activity characterised by intervals of rapidly occurring events separated by long periods of inactivity  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a wide range of systems in nature displays such a behaviour @xcite .    given the highly non - linear nature of human actions ,",
    "their study could hence benefit from the insights provided by the field of complex systems . for the human being",
    ", the bursty behaviour phenomenon has been found to modulate several activities , such as sending letters , writing email messages , sending mobile sms , making phone calls and web browsing @xcite .",
    "the first works in this field suggested a decision - based queuing process , according to which the next task to be executed is to be chosen from a queue with a hierarchy of importance , in order to explain this behaviour .",
    "different kinds of hierarchies were tested , such as taking into account the task length and deadline constraints @xcite .",
    "later on , malmgren _",
    "_ @xcite argued that decision making is not a necessary component of the bursty human activity patterns .",
    "instead , they maintained that this feature is caused by cyclic constraints in life and they proposed a mechanism based on the coupling of a cascading activity to cyclic repetition in order to explain it . nonetheless , recently , hang - hyun jo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite applied a de - seasoning method to remove the circadian cycle and weekly patterns from the time series , and obtained similar inter - event distributions , before and after this filtering procedure . in this way",
    ", the authors concluded that cyclic activity is also not a necessary ingredient of bursty behaviour .",
    "however they do not provide an explanation for the fundamental origin of burstiness .",
    "such explanation is still missing in the literature and the scope of this article is to add some new insights into this issue by looking into wikipedia editing .",
    "the success of research in digital social patterns hinges on the access to high quality data .",
    "even though the availability of recorded data and its accessibility are rapidly increasing , many data sets are not freely available for research .",
    "wikipedia ( wp ) is an important exception , as not only is it considered a robust and trustworthy source of information @xcite , but it is also easily accessible via the api @xcite or the different available dumps @xcite .",
    "the accessible data contain the whole editing history record for both pages and editors .",
    "we start by showing that this database captures the bursty nature of the human actions , and that the human activity region described by the bursty coefficient and memory effect in @xcite must be increased if it is to accommodate the editing activity of wikipedia .",
    "we also show the cyclic nature of the data and the circadian patterns in wp editing .",
    "most interestingly , we show how , although the editing activity is strongly constrained by the time of day at which it happens , the final probability distribution of the inter - event times is quite independent of that , displaying a fat tail that is robust against changes of editing time during the day .",
    "this suggests that burstiness in human behaviour is mostly independent of cycles in life . finally , we look into the effect that stationarity may have on burstiness ; whether a change on editing activity over time may be the cause for the fat tail of the inter - event distribution .",
    "our results indicate that burstiness is common to all editors , whether their editing history is stationary or not , which suggests that there does not seem to be a cause and effect relationship between non - stationarity and burstiness .",
    "having discarded cycles in life and non - stationarity as possible causes for burstiness , our findings suggest a sort of robust distribution for the time between activities , set internally by individuals .",
    "our data sample is a database of wikipedia ( wp ) edits of all the pages written in english in the period of @xmath0 years ending on january @xmath1 ; the dump contains @xmath2 pages @xcite . for each entry , we know : the wikipedia page name , the edit time stamp and the identification of the editor who did the changes .",
    "we analyse the information separately for each page and for each editor and , in order to reduce the impact of outliers , we did not consider the pages or editors with less than @xmath3 activities . this number is a good compromise between having enough pages / editors and the pages being frequently updated or the editor being reasonably active in this time span .",
    "we also remove from the data the edits made by wp - bots , which are programs that go through the wp carrying out automatically repetitive and mundane tasks to maintain the wp pages ( as software programs , their edit pattern is different from the humans ) .",
    "a list of the bots can be found in @xcite .",
    "moreover , we discard entries associated to ip s and only consider editors who login before editing , so that the editor is univocally identified .    in order to obtain the power spectrum of the editing activity shown in fig .",
    "[ fourier1 ] for editors and in fig .",
    "[ fourier2 ] for pages , we binarized our activity record for any editor and any page with small enough bins to contain at most one edit .",
    "finally we performed a fast fourier transform ( fft ) on such preprocessed data .",
    "although in every 5,000 edits there is one second with more than one edit , we checked that the results do not change if these values are truncated to one ( for the editors this must correspond to a double saving operation in the same second and this should reasonably be counted as one ) .",
    "let @xmath4 be a variable that identifies each editor in our sample , @xmath5 the time at which @xmath4 edits for the nth time and @xmath6 the nth inter - event time for that editor ( where obviously @xmath7 ) .",
    "for the sake of clarity in the equations , we avoid this cumbersome notation and omit the superscript @xmath4 , writing just @xmath8 and @xmath9 for short .",
    "these should be understood as referring the specific editor that is being considered . the same will apply to the other variables in the following equations .",
    "a standard measure of burstiness has been provided by goh _",
    "_ @xcite . for editor @xmath4",
    "we obtain : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are , respectively , the mean and standard deviation of the set of values @xmath9 which refer to editor @xmath4 .",
    "parameter @xmath13 measures the magnitude of the variance in comparison to the mean , and goes from -1 ( @xmath14 ) , for periodic signals , to 1 ( @xmath15 ) for strongly bursty distributions .",
    "in order to have a better characterisation for the general behaviour of the editing process , we also compute the memory coefficient @xmath16 , for editor @xmath4 , which is also defined in @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number of inter - event values for that particular editor ( equal to the number of edits minus 1 ) , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) are , respectively , the average and the standard deviation of the set of all inter - event times except the last one ( the first one ) .",
    "this coefficient is very similar to the autocorrelation function for consecutive inter - events and is positive when short ( large ) inter - event times tend to be followed by short ( large ) inter - event times , negative in the opposite case and otherwise close to zero .    in fig .",
    "[ figbm ] we show the scatter plot of the joint distributions of @xmath16 and @xmath13 .",
    "we can see that the main population has high values of burstiness and , at the same time , low memory effects , meaning that there is small correlation between the sizes of the time span of two consecutive inter - events .",
    "the average values obtained for @xmath13 and @xmath16 are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , values that result to be outside the region of human behaviour reported by goh _",
    "@xcite ( red zone in figure 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "the value for @xmath25 is small but it is statistically different from zero , as we now show . the normalised distribution of the values of @xmath16 for all the editors is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "the distribution is very skewed , with very few negative values . to determine whether the average value obtained for @xmath16 is statistically relevant ( different from zero ) we built a null - model . for each editor",
    ", we reshuffled the sequence of inter - event times @xmath26 and obtained a new sequence @xmath27 where all possible time correlations have been destroyed .",
    "then , we computed the memory coefficient @xmath28 of such new sequence .",
    "finally we repeated such a process @xmath29 times and computed the average @xmath30 of all the memory coefficients , as well as its standard deviation @xmath31 .",
    "the normalised distribution of @xmath30 is shown in the middle panel of fig  [ figm ] .",
    "we can see that @xmath30 is basically zero , due to the elimination of the memory ( time correlations ) by the reshuffling . on the right panel of the same figure we report the normalised distribution of the z - scores @xmath32 . from the latter plot we confirm that the average of @xmath33 ( which is basically equal to @xmath25 ) is large enough , in terms of standard deviations , to conclude that the value of @xmath34 is statistically relevant and different from zero .",
    "wp editors , as much as anybody else , live in a dynamic environment , strongly conditioned by periodic factors : day / night , weekdays / weekends , seasons , etc . it",
    "it thus important to check whether their wp activity is also conditioned by such rregularities . for this purpose , we selected the @xmath29 most active editors and computed the fourier power spectrum of each editor time activity , as explained in the methods .",
    "the results for two representative editors are reported in fig .",
    "[ fourier1 ] where we show the power spectrum for editors @xmath35 ( left ) and @xmath36 ( right ) . in each panel",
    "a main peak is clearly visible at @xmath37 hz corresponding to a period of @xmath38 hours as well as a second peak at @xmath39 hz associated to a @xmath40 hours period ( a harmonic of the main peak ) .",
    "other harmonics are also visible , especially in the right panel .",
    "we checked that these values are robust against the choice of the bin size , from a few seconds up to several hours , used to perform the fft .    in order to check whether this periodicity is particular to human behaviour , we repeated this procedure for the wp pages .",
    "we selected the 100 pages with more edits and evaluated the fourier power spectrum in the same way that was done for the editors .",
    "we found that , in general , pages lack predominant peaks in the power spectrum .",
    "they appear only in pages related to records ( for example births / deaths counting ) or companies , which in general update their pages daily . in figure",
    "[ fourier2 ] , we show the power spectrum of a generic page in the left panel , as an example for the general behaviour found in the wp pages . in the right panel",
    "we show the power spectrum of the wp page of a big company . in the latter case",
    ", we can see clearly the one day period that is lacking in the generic wp page .",
    "it is interesting that pages do not show periodic behaviour , even though they are edited by editors who do show that behaviour .",
    "the conjugation of many different editors , with different editing rhythms , wipes out the periodicity , just like summing many oscillators with random phases .",
    "a better illustration of these circadian patterns can be found in fig .",
    "[ circadian ] , which shows the average number of edits over a period of one week ( left ) and one day ( right ) of editors @xmath35 ( top ) and @xmath36 ( bottom ) , as a function of the editing time . to build the daily ( weekly ) plot , we divided the whole time span of our data of about ten years into days ( weeks ) , and then divided each day ( week ) in 48 ( 168 ) windows with 30 ( 60 ) minutes each . for each window , we computed the average number of edits that were performed inside that window for every day ( week ) for the whole 10 year time span .",
    "that gives the daily ( weekly ) average activity which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ circadian ] .",
    "the circadian patterns are visible in the plots ; each editor exhibits clearly one peak ( sometimes two peaks ) of activity every day .",
    "we can also see a daily trough of low activity that will probably correspond to the time when the editor rests .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that editing is strongly influenced by the circadian cycle ; in this section we analyse whether these circadian patterns have consequences on the inter - event probability distribution . to perform such an analysis we computed the probability distribution for inter - events of a given duration assuming that they have been saved at a particular time of day .",
    "if this probability depends on the time of day at which they are recorded , then the time spent in a human activity is also dictated by cycles and thus the origin of burstiness can possibly be ascribed to this phenomenon ; on the other hand , if the probability to perform an activity that lasts a definite amount of time does not depend on the time of day at which it is registered , then we can conclude that burstiness in wp editing does not depend on the periodically changing environment",
    ".    results reported in fig .",
    "[ interdiarydistri ] support the latter hypothesis .",
    "the inter - event probability distributions computed in different time windows , with a one hour time span , exhibit a similar fat tail when they are normalized by the number of event in that hour .",
    "note that only 17 time windows are shown in fig .",
    "[ interdiarydistri ] .",
    "seven windows were left out as they correspond to the periods of low activity shown in fig .",
    "[ circadian ] and had too little data to be relevant .",
    "this seems to indicate that , although the event probability responds to strong circadian patterns during the day , the bursty nature of the process is not a consequence of that cyclic behaviour . in ref @xcite , the authors reported the independence of burstiness with respect to the 24 hour cycles , showing the same inter - event distribution in windows of one day .",
    "what we show here is the same inter - event distribution but in windows of one hour , where the brevity of the time windows provides a good proxy for the independence of the activity duration from the time of day of its realisation .",
    "this kind of universality has been reported in phenomena emerging from the joint action of several individuals @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , the occurrence of this phenomenon as a result of a single person s decision has not been reported previously in the literature .",
    "finally we must discard any effects on the bursty nature of the data due to changes in the editing activity along the years  @xcite .",
    "we check the stationarity of the time series of editors by splitting it into ten windows , each one corresponding to the same time span , and comparing the probability distributions of inter - events of all ten windows with each other .",
    "we have done that for the editing data of several editors .    in order to compare the ten probability distributions with one another",
    ", we used the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test .",
    "some editors show , indeed , a lack of stationary behavior on the time scale of one year .",
    "however , there are some for which the probability distributions are very similar across the ten windows . as an example",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ figks ] the results for four editors . for each editor",
    ", we show in the left panel the distribution of the inter - event times for each of the ten windows , while in the right panel we show the results of the kolmogorov - smirnov test for all combinations of different time windows .",
    "both panels seem to indicate that the distributions shown on the left - hand side are stationary , while the distributions shown on the right - hand side become somewhat stationary after the fourth time window onwards . in the top row",
    "we show the results for editors @xmath35 and @xmath36 mentioned before , who have different degrees of behaviour towards stationarity .",
    "nevertheless , our previous results stand for both of them , thus suggesting that the somewhat lack of stationarity of editor @xmath36 does not affect our previous results .    in table",
    "[ table : t1 ] we show the values of @xmath41 for each of the ten time windows , as well as the values for the whole data span .",
    "we can see that @xmath41 is high in each window , which seems to confirm the lack of correlation between burstiness and non - stationarity .",
    ".values of burstiness for all data and in time windows , for editors @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : t1 ]",
    "in this work , we study bursty behavior in human activities and try to understand its origin . using data from wikipedia editing ,",
    "we have measured the average level of burstiness @xmath41 and memory @xmath44 of editors , using standard indicators .",
    "remarkably , our results fall outside the region in the @xmath45 plane ascribed to human activity as proposed by @xcite , thus suggesting that such region should be enlarged .",
    "we showed that the events are strongly conditioned by the circadian cycle of @xmath38 hours , while the inter - events are stationary on the same time scale .",
    "this suggests that burstiness is not a consequence of the cyclic nature of human activity .",
    "instead , it seems to be intrinsic to mankind nature : before performing an action ( make a phone call , write an email , edit wikipedia , etc ) we must overcome a  barrier \" , acting as a cost , which depends , among many other things , on the time of day . however , once that  barrier \" has been crossed , the time taken by that activity no longer depends on the time of day at which we decided to perform it . instead , there is a robust distribution of dedicated time in proportion to the different amount of activities that the individual is able to do at specific times .",
    "it could be related to some sort of queuing process , but we prefer to see it as due to resource allocation ( attention , time , energy ) , which exhibits a broad distribution : shorter activities are more likely to be executed next than the longer ones , which ultimately may be responsible for the bursty nature of human behavior .",
