    "interpolation is a fundamental operation in digital signal processing , and has many applications such as signal reconstruction , signal compression / expansion , and resizing / rotating digital images @xcite . if digital data ( discrete - time signals ) to be interpolated are spaced uniformly on the time axis , the _ uniform _ interpolation is executed by an expander and a digital filter ( called an interpolation filter ) @xcite , which is conventionally designed via the sampling theorem .    _",
    "periodically nonuniform _ interpolation ( or decimation ) also plays an important role in signal processing , such as signal compression by nonuniform filterbanks @xcite , super - resolution image processing @xcite , and time - interleaved ad converters @xcite .",
    "the design has been studied by many researchers @xcite , in which the design methods are based on the generalized sampling theorem , assuming that the original signals to be sampled are _ band - limited _ below the nyquist frequency . then the optimal filter ( or the perfect reconstruction filter )",
    "is given by an ideal lowpass filter with complex coefficients @xcite .",
    "since the ideal filter can not be realized , approximation methods are also proposed ; see in particular @xcite .    on the other hand , real signals such as audio signals ( esp .",
    "orchestral music ) violate the band - limiting assumption in the sampling theorem , that is , they have some frequency components beyond the nyquist frequency . in view of this , we have to take account of the _ whole _ frequency range in designing interpolation systems . for this purpose , _ sampled - data @xmath0 optimization _",
    "@xcite is very adequate .",
    "a similar philosophy has also been presented and proposed by unser and co - workers @xcite .",
    "this method is a generalization of shannon sampling theory intending to give a machinery that works for signals that are not necessarily perfectly band - limited .",
    "the method works well for those analog signals that belong to a prespecified subspace , but not necessarily so for those that do not .",
    "it is even shown that their method can lead to an unstable reconstruction filter @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the signal subspace is constructed by the linear span of a given generating function , but it is not easy to identify the generating function in real applications .",
    "on the other hand , our approach models the signal subspace in terms of analog ( continuous - time ) frequency characteristics , which can easily be identified by modeling a signal generator by physical laws or through the fourier transform of real signals .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to propose a new design method for nonuniform interpolation via sampled - data @xmath0 optimization .",
    "this design problem is formulated by minimizing the @xmath0 norm ( @xmath1-induced norm ) of the error system between the delayed original analog signals and the output of the reconstruction system .",
    "since this error system includes both continuous- and discrete - time signals ( systems ) , the optimization is an infinite dimensional one . to convert this to a finite dimensional optimization",

    "by this method , the optimal interpolation filter can be obtained by numerical computations .",

    "we also show in this paper that there are cases with the same decimation rates but the optimal reconstruction performances can differ when the decimation patterns are different .",
