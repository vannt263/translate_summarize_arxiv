    "on starting up a reciprocating four stroke engine , after a few cycles , the engine settles to a limiting smooth cycle of operation .",
    "the present theoretical analysis is devoted to the characterization of the transition period from the state when the engine is started up to the sequence of states characterizing the periodic steady state termed the limit cycle .",
    "the process has similarities to the approach to thermodynamical equilibrium of an initially displaced state .",
    "this relaxation to equilibrium is accompanied by entropy production signifying the irreversible character of the process .",
    "entropy is produced in the approach to the limit cycle but unlike an equilibrium state entropy continues to be produced also when the limit cycle is reached .",
    "the approach to a limit cycle is based on the concept of a basin of attraction where the limit cycle is located at its minimum .",
    "the basin of attraction is set by external and internal constraints .",
    "dissipative forces cause the system to settle down to the minimum of such a basin .",
    "a first principle study requires to determine the equations of motion governing the dynamics of the engine . for this task in the study , the framework of open quantum systems",
    "is employed @xcite .",
    "the key point is that the dynamics of the engine is governed by a completely positive map @xcite . then the limit cycle becomes a fixed point of this map . in order to determine if the approach to the limit cycle is monotonic , a measure of distance between the actual state of the engine and the final limiting cycle has to be defined .",
    "such a measure of distance between two quantum states is not obvious due to the possibility that the two states do not commute . in analogy",
    "to linear response theory it is expected that close enough to the limit cycle all distance measures should show the same relaxation rate toward the target limit cycle .",
    "this prediction is consistent with the results of the present study .",
    "nevertheless at large distance from the limit cycle only the quantum measures show a monotonic approach to it .",
    "the present paper is a continuation of a series of studies on a four stroke quantum engine @xcite .",
    "the models studied were based on a first principle quantum description of the dynamics .",
    "the previous studies showed that the model engine displays the irreversible characteristics of common real heat engines operating in finite time .",
    "the performance of the quantum engine was found to be limited by finite heat transfer .",
    "in addition quantum performance limitations on the adiabatic branches mimicked very closely macroscopic friction phenomena @xcite .",
    "the quantum discrete heat engine is composed of a quantum working fluid , a hot and a cold bath and an external field which can alter the energy levels of the working medium .",
    "the control parameters are the time allocations on the different branches , the total cycle time and the extreme values of the external field .",
    "all four branches are described by quantum equations of motion .",
    "the thermodynamical consequences can therefore be derived from first principles .",
    "a minimum set of three thermodynamical observables was found which were sufficient to characterize the performance of the engine .",
    "with two additional variables , the state of the working fluid could also be characterized @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the state is necessary in order to evaluate the entropy and the internal temperature , variables which are necessary to establish a thermodynamic perspective .",
    "the intuitive notion is that the limit cycle is characterized by the external constraints and internal properties of the engine .",
    "the following questions arise naturally :    * how do the control parameters characterize the approach to the limit cycle ? * can conditions be found for the non - existence of a limit cycle ? * what are the irreversible properties of the limit cycle ?    the present paper is devoted to the study of these issues in the context of quantum thermodynamics .",

    "heat transport between the working medium and the baths is a common source of irreversibility for all realistic heat engines . if this is the only source of entropy generation the engine is classified as endoreversible @xcite , meaning that entropy is only generated on the interface and that the internal operation is reversible .",
    "the dissipative forces accompanying heat transfer were found to be sufficient to drive a quantum two - level endoreversible heat engine to a limit cycle @xcite .",

    "external work is converted to internal heat which is dissipated to the cold bath .",
    "the only phenomena that fits this behavior is friction .",
    "surprisingly , the von neumann entropy for the complete cycle trajectory is constant .",
    "this is in contrast to a power producing cycle where the von neumann entropy changes on the _ isochores_. a detailed analysis of the von neumann entropy change on the cold _ isochore _ performed in the energy representation unravel the picture .",
    "a decrease in the entropy of diagonal elements , equivalent to @xmath226 due to cooling of the working medium is exactly compensated by an entropy increase due to dephasing i.e. loss of the nondiagonal elements .",
    "it seems therefore that friction is the result of the interplay between the unitary evolution on the _ adiabats _ and the dissipative dynamics on the cold _",
    "isochore_. friction is found only when the state of the quantum engine deviates from a diagonal energy representation .",
    "such dynamics are a consequence of the nonadiabatic operation conditions caused by the noncommutability of the working medium hamiltonian at different points along the cycle trajectory .",
    "these observations are the basis for a quantum control of friction which will be presented in a future study .",
