    "the theory becomes conformal due to the presence of the banks - zaks infrared fixed point .",

    "these results have also been discussed from the more general perspective of higher dimensional representations @xcite .",
    "there is more than one reason for interest in these studies .",
    "first , the uncovering of the rich phase structure of vector - like theories such as qcd , is in itself a good step forward in our understanding of gauge field theories in general .",
    "secondly , the extent and the nature of the conformal window is of interest to model builders , since it can be used to describe electroweak symmetry breaking",
    ". finally , the exploration of the temperature dependence of the same phenomena adds one further perspective , as there should be a connection of some sort between the conformal phase of qcd and the quark gluon plasma phase .",
    "more recently , analytical studies of qcd at large @xmath0 have been extended to finite temperature , and the critical line in the t , @xmath0 plane has been predicted on the base of a truncated renormalization group flow calculation @xcite .",
    "note that the number of flavours can indeed be regarded as a continuous variable , since the casimir s are polynomials in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this means that the critical line found in @xcite is in fact a true phase boundary between a conventional goldstone phase and a chirally symmetric phase , the zero temperature limit of which is the onset of the conformal phase .",
    "we sketch the resulting phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ phase_sketch ] .",
    "an interesting question is how the conformal phase of zero temperature , large @xmath0 qcd is connected with the high temperature , small @xmath0 quark gluon plasma phase .",
    "one important difference between the two is that the conformal phase possesses no inherent scale , while the other high t phase contains , of course , the temperature as a scale . as a consequence ,",
    "the pion will be massless in the chiral limit of the conformal phase , while its mass will equal the lowest matsubara frequency in the chiral limit at high t. thus , the behaviour in the conformal window is in principle different from that in the high temperature , small @xmath0 regime of qcd .",
    "however , it is unclear if the pion mass  or any other observable  can be regarded as an order parameter , or , in other words , if we should envisage a further critical line at the right side of the chiral line in fig .",
    "[ phase_sketch ] . additionally , the issue whether chiral symmetry restoration , for fermions in the fundamental representation , is always accompanied by , and coinciding with , a deconfinement transition , is an open and relevant problem . much of the numerical evidence up to date points to their entanglement , but recent work advocates a separation of the two transitions , at least in the large @xmath9 limit @xcite .",
    "it is very interesting to see what happens for large @xmath0 .",
    "lattice calculations provide a nonperturbative framework to attack this problem . the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ phase_sketch ] suggests a natural strategy for finding the lower limit of the conformal phase : simply , find for which @xmath0 the transition disappears . as a by - product , the numerically determined critical temperature as a function of @xmath0",

    "_ , title=\"fig:\",width=12 ]    there is however one complication .",
    "namely , it has been proposed  and to some extent proven  that the strong coupling limit of lattice qcd is always confining , regardless of the value of @xmath0 ( see again _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "a simple argument is that , at large enough coupling , @xmath0 means nothing .",
    "for instance , the statement that at @xmath0 = 16 asymptotic freedom is lost , is a statement of the continuum weak coupling regime , which has no special relevance at strong coupling . even for those @xmath0 which are supposed to fall deeply in the conformal phase , a strong coupling limit still exists which breaks chiral symmetry and confines .",
    "this means that , even when the weak coupling continuum regime is conformal , a zero temperature ` lattice ' phase transition will always take place between a strong and a weak coupling regime . in other words , for a fixed number of flavours , and for a given temporal extension of the lattice @xmath10 , we expect a phase transition to occur as a function of the lattice coupling to a ` strongly coupled ' phase where chiral symmetry is broken , i.e. the chiral condensate is non zero in the chiral limit .",
    "this type of transition , called a bulk phase transition , has to be distinguished from a true thermal transition .",
    "we can thus envisage two types of lattice behaviour as a function of the number of flavours .",
    "when @xmath0 is such that qcd in the continuum still breaks chiral symmetry and confines , _",
    "i.e. _ when the continuum limit describes the ordinary phase of qcd , no transition is expected at zero temperature  or , equivalently , @xmath11 , given that @xmath12 , with the lattice spacing @xmath13 a function of the inverse lattice coupling @xmath14 .",
    "if a lattice transition occurs it should get closer to @xmath15 and eventually disappear when @xmath16 . instead ,",
    "for the values of @xmath0 for which an infrared fixed point exists , the lattice phase transition should survive the @xmath17 limit , _",
    "i.e. _ it is a bulk phase transition .",
    "the larger @xmath0 , the closer this bulk phase transition should get to the infinite coupling @xmath18 limit .    at a practical level",
    ", one should be able to distinguish between a bulk phase transition and a true thermal phase transition by studying the behaviour of the theory for a given @xmath0 at different values of @xmath10 and at varying lattice coupling @xmath19 . if the critical point remains non zero @xmath20 when @xmath16 we have a bulk transition , thus providing a strong evidence that at the given @xmath0 the continuum theory is chirally symmetric and falls into the conformal window .",
    "the alternative behaviour will point to a thermal transition happening at a given physical temperature @xmath21 .",
    "the authors of @xcite performed a pioneering study at @xmath22 and @xmath23 at small volumes ( mainly @xmath24 ) and relatively heavy masses , reporting interesting evidence for a persistence of a first order thermal phase transition at @xmath22 and discussing its sensitivity to fermion masses .",
    "subsequent work by the columbia collaboration @xcite suggested a rich structure of the phase diagram , dominated by lattice artifacts and was not completely conclusive .",
    "iwasaki and collaborators performed a detailed lattice study , finding that a value as low as @xmath25 should be set as the lower limit of the conformal window @xcite .",
    "note that these authors challenge the commonly held opinion that the strong coupling limit of qcd breaks chiral symmetry , irrespectively of @xmath0 . in the already mentioned paper @xcite , the authors consider @xmath26 , the largest value of @xmath0 still compatible with asymptotic freedom , and",
    "confirm that chiral symmetry is not broken at weak coupling by observing the expected bulk transition at intermediate coupling .",
    "several other studies have observed phase transitions as a function of the gauge coupling for @xmath27 @xcite , leaving the question of the fate of these transitions in the continuum limit open .",
    "recent work by appelquist and collaborators @xcite finds evidence that @xmath28 is still confining in the continuum limit .",
    "in particular , they conclude that @xmath29 , the threshold of the conformal window , should be close to 12 .",
    "they study the approach to the continuum by use of the schrdinger functional and the step scaling method , the lattice discretized version of the renormalization group running coupling , and do not discuss how a bulk transition would affect these calculations .    in summary",

    "the simulations in this paper were performed using a slightly modified version of the publicly available milc code @xcite . a setup similar to the one used by milc in their recent paper on the qcd equation of state @xcite was employed .",
    "we use an improved kogut - susskind fermion action , the `` asqtad '' action which removes lattice artifacts up to @xmath31 @xcite and a one - loop symanzik improved @xcite and tadpole improved @xcite gauge action . the complete action for",

    ", the @xmath45 values for each run were determined by a self consistency procedure on @xmath47 and @xmath48 lattices for every @xmath19 investigated .",
    "it has been proposed recently by members of the hpqcd collaboration @xcite to include the effect of dynamical quarks into the one - loop improvement of the gauge action , the required coefficients of which they determined to first order through lattice perturbation theory .",
    "while it is true that a complete @xmath49 improvement should fully account for gauge and quark loop contributions , the reliability of a one - loop truncated perturbative contribution from dynamical quarks at large @xmath0 becomes questionable .",
    "since the coefficients found in @xcite are sizable and linear in the flavour number , a resummation would probably be called for , especially in the case of large @xmath0 . barring this , there is a risk that including a truncated series would severely overcompensate the actual quark loop effects and in fact worsen the @xmath49 improvement , for values of @xmath50 .",
    "the scaling violations that are being observed for the heavy quark potential with the customary ` partially ' improved action are not completely negligible , but well under control @xcite . on the base of these considerations and the fact that observables employed in this study are less sensitive to scaling violation effects , we did not include these one - loop dynamical quark improvements .",

    "the disconnected chiral susceptibility is a non - local quantity that can be estimated from the variance of the bulk behaviour of the chiral condensate .",

    "@xcite , we straightforwardly eliminate those contributions by only considering the off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix of the random sources introduced for the estimation of the chiral condensate .",

    "their associated cumulant @xmath74 should be , in the absence of explicit chiral symmetry breaking , one in a chirally symmetric regime , while it should be zero in the spontaneously broken phase .",
    "this dimensionless quantity is therefore a most useful physical observable in analyzing chiral phase transitions , and we will employ it to compare results from simulations run at different temporal extents of the lattice .",
    "the introductory discussion tells us that we must observe a phase transition between a phase where chiral symmetry is broken to a phase where chiral symmetry is realized , for some value of the lattice gauge coupling @xmath76 .",
    "there are basically two ways to assess a phase transition on a lattice .",
    "first , one can rely on obtaining infinite volume estimates of relevant quantities by performing simulations on lattices of different spatial extents .",
    "whenever this is possible , the critical behaviour is analogous to the one observed in the continuum .",
    "this strategy usually breaks down very close to the critical point , where the correlation length of the system grows large and becomes comparable to the lattice size . when this happens , it is mandatory to use finite size scaling techniques .",

    "results for the chiral condensate and the polyakov loop are shown in fig .",

    "the jump between the two branches is very clear for both observables and suggestive of a discontinuity .",
    "these results allow us to immediately identify a critical region for @xmath19 between 4.1 and 4.15 . in this region , one would expect to observe tunnelling between the two phases and enhancement of the associated susceptibilities . as mentioned above , the approach to the infinite volume limit should be slower here , because of the increasing correlation lengths . indeed , volume dependence is observed , with the smaller of the lattices having a slightly higher @xmath76 .",

    "the lattice determined critical regions at @xmath75 ( blue ) and @xmath55 ( red ) are indicated by vertical lines.__,width=12 ]    we did not observe any signal of discontinuity in the polyakov loop in our simulations at @xmath55 , with a lattice mass @xmath100 and in the critical region of the chiral condensate .",
    "while the presence or absence of this signal is of no physical relevance below the infinite mass limit , given that the polyakov loop is not an order parameter in the presence of dynamical fermions , we can still use its behaviour at light quark masses to gain further insight into the mechanism that relates chiral symmetry restoration to deconfinement and the two limiting regimes of zero mass and infinite mass fermions . here , we limited ourselves to verify that the presence or absence of a discontinuity of the polyakov loop in coincidence with the discontinuity of the chiral condensate depends upon the physical fermion mass . by sufficiently lowering the fermion mass at @xmath55",
    "we expect that the picture of @xmath75 will be restored .    however , the region of sufficiently light quark mass is a dynamical property of the @xmath132 theory which can not be judged a priori . a further refinement of this study can help in locating the critical end - points",
    ". the reader might want to review @xcite for a pioneering study at @xmath133 .",
    "we postpone to future publications a more refined study of the quark mass dependence of the chiral condensate , and a thorough scale setting procedure for the results obtained in this work .",
    "the present results allow us to firmly conclude that we are seeing a true thermal transition , in other words @xmath27 undergoes a chiral restoration transition at finite temperature .",
    "we find @xmath134 , or @xmath135 and @xmath136 , or @xmath137 and observe the asymptotic scaling of the critical temperature within @xmath138 by use of the perturbative scaling induced by asymptotic freedom , where the two loop beta function for an @xmath1 gauge theory with @xmath27 massless flavours has been used .",
    "these observations , obtained with an improved lattice action , might well explain the lack of asymptotic scaling noted in previous studies , where no improvement was yet considered .",
    "all evidence presented in this paper is consistent with asymptotic scaling and the occurrence of a true thermal transition .",
    "the emerging picture confirms the conclusion of the recent work @xcite , as well as ladder calculations @xcite , providing a strong evidence that @xmath1 gauge theory with eight flavours is in the normal , chirally broken phase of qcd at zero temperature and in the continuum limit .",
    "this study is one step in our attempt to clarify the way @xmath1 gauge theory with many flavours approaches the conformal phase @xcite that precedes the loss of asymptotic freedom .",
