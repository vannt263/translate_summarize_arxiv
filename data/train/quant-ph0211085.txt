    "conservative logic has been introduced in @xcite as a mathematical model that allows one to describe computations which reflect some properties of microdynamical laws of physics , such as reversibility and conservation of the internal energy of the physical system used to perform the computations .",
    "the model is based upon the so called fredkin gate , a three  input / three  output boolean gate originally introduced by petri in @xcite , whose input / output map @xmath2 associates any input triple @xmath3 with its corresponding output triple @xmath4 as follows : @xmath5    the fredkin gate is _ functionally complete _ for the boolean logic : by fixing @xmath6 we get @xmath7 , whereas by fixing @xmath8 and @xmath6 we get @xmath9 .",
    "a useful point of view is that the fredkin gate behaves as a _ conditional switch _ : that is , @xmath10 and @xmath11 for every @xmath12 . in other words ,",
    "the first input line can be considered as a control line whose value determines whether the input values @xmath13 and @xmath14 have to be exchanged or not .    according to @xcite ,",
    "_ conservativeness _ is usually modeled by the property that the output patterns of the involved gates are always a permutation of the patterns given in input .",
    "let us stress that this does not mean that a fixed permutation is applied to every possible input pattern ; on the contrary , the applied permutation depends on the input pattern .",
    "here we just mention the fact that every permutation can be written as a composition of transpositions .",
    "hence not only the fredkin gate can be used to build an appropriate circuit to perform any given conservative computation ( and thus it is universal also in this sense with respect to conservative computations ) , but it is also the most elementary conceivable operation that can be used to describe conservative computations . in this paper",
    "we will propose some analogous elementary operations with respect to our notion of conservativeness .",
    "the fredkin gate is also _",
    "reversible _ , that is , fg is a bijective map on @xmath15 .",
    "notice that conservativeness and reversibility are two independent notions : a gate can satisfy both properties , only one of them , or none .",
    "since every reversible gate computes a bijective map between input and output patterns , and every conservative gate produces permutations of its input patterns , it follows that they must necessarily have the same number of input and output lines .    in this paper",
    "we extend the notion of conservativeness to generic gates whose input and output lines may assume a finite number @xmath0 of truth values , and we derive some properties which are satisfied by conservative gates . by associating equispaced energy levels to the truth values , we show that our notion of conservativeness corresponds to the energy conservation principle applied to the data which are manipulated during the computation .",
    "let us stress that we are _ not _ saying that the entire energy used to perform the computation is preserved , or that the computing device is a conservative physical system . in particular we do not consider the energy needed to transform the input values into output values , that is , the energy needed to _ perform _ the computation .",
    "successively we introduce the notion of _ conservative computation _ , based upon gates which are able to store some finite amount of energy and to reuse it during the computation .",
    "we show that the decision problem to determine whether a given computation can be performed in a conservative way through a gate which is able to store at most @xmath16 units of energy is np  complete .    finally , we introduce a framework that allows one to visualize the movement of energy occurring during a computation performed by a generic gate .",
    "the framework is based upon some primitive operators that conditionally move one unit of energy between any two given input / output lines of the gate . using creation and annihilation operators on the hilbert space @xmath1",
    ", we show a quantum realization of these non  unitary conditional movement operators .",
    "our notion of conservativeness , and the framework we will introduce , are based upon many  valued logics .",
    "these are extensions of the classical boolean logic which are widely used to manage incomplete and/or uncertain knowledge .",
    "different approaches to many  valued logics have been considered in literature : for an overview , see @xcite .",
    "however , here we are not interested into the study of syntactical or algebraic aspects of many  valued logics ; we just define some gates whose input and output lines may assume `` intermediate '' truth values , such as the gates defined in @xcite .    for every integer @xmath17 , we consider the finite set @xmath18 , @xmath19 of truth values ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote falsity and truth , respectively , whereas the other values of @xmath22 indicate different degrees of indefiniteness . as usually found in literature , we will use @xmath22 both as a set of truth values and as a numerical set equipped with the standard order relation on rational numbers .",
    "an @xmath23input/@xmath24output @xmath0valued _ function _ ( also called an @xmath25function for short ) is a map @xmath26 .",
    "analogously , an @xmath27_gate _ and an @xmath27_circuit _ are devices that compute @xmath27functions .",
    "a gate is considered as a _ primitive operation _ , that is , it is assumed that a gate can not be decomposed into simpler parts . on the other hand ,",
    "a circuit is composed by _",
    "layers _ of gates , where any two gates @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the same layer satisfy the property that no output line of @xmath28 is connected to any input line of @xmath29 .",
    "let us consider the set @xmath30 of real values ; for exposition convenience , we can think to such quantities as energy values .",
    "to each truth value @xmath31 we associate the energy level @xmath32 ; moreover , let us assume that the values of @xmath33 are all positive , equispaced , and ordered according to the corresponding truth values : @xmath34 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath35 the gap between two adjacent energy levels then the following holds : @xmath36 notice that it is not required that @xmath37 .",
    "now , let @xmath38 be an input _ pattern _ for an @xmath27gate .",
    "we define the _ amount of energy associated to @xmath39 _ as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the amount of energy associated to the @xmath42th element @xmath43 of the input pattern .",
    "let us remark that the map @xmath44 is indeed a family of mappings parameterized by @xmath23 , the size of the input .",
    "analogously , for an output pattern @xmath45 we define the associated amount of energy as @xmath46 .",
    "we can now define a conservative gate as follows .",
    "an @xmath47gate , described by the function @xmath48 , is _ conservative _ if the following condition holds : @xmath49    notice that it is not required that the gate has the same number of input and output lines , as it happens with the reversible and conservative gates considered in @xcite .",
    "using relation , equation can also be written as : @xmath50 hence , when @xmath51 ( as it happens , for example , with reversible gates ) conservativeness reduces to the conservation of the sum of truth values given in input , as in weak conservativeness introduced in @xcite . in the boolean case",
    "this is equivalent to requiring that the number of @xmath21 s given in input is preserved , as in the original notion of conservativeness given in @xcite .",
    "an interesting remark is that conservativeness entails an upper and a lower bound to the ratio @xmath52 of the number of output lines versus the number of input lines of a gate .",
    "in fact , the maximum amount of energy that can be associated to an input pattern is @xmath53 , whereas the minimum amount of energy that can be associated to an output pattern is @xmath54 .",
    "clearly , if it holds @xmath55 then the gate can not produce any output pattern in a conservative way . as a consequence , it must hold @xmath56 . analogously , if we consider the minimum amount of energy @xmath57 that can be associated to an input pattern @xmath39 and the maximum amount of energy @xmath58 that can be associated to an output pattern @xmath59 , it clearly must hold @xmath60 , that is @xmath61 . summarizing , we have the bounds @xmath62 , that is , for a conservative gate ( or circuit ) the number @xmath24 of output lines is constrained to grow linearly with respect to the number @xmath23 of input lines .    a natural question is whether we can compute all functions in a conservative way .",
    "let us consider the boolean case .",
    "let @xmath63 be a non necessarily conservative function , and let us define the following quantities : @xmath64 informally , @xmath65 ( resp . , @xmath66 )",
    "is the maximum number of @xmath21 s ( resp .",
    ", @xmath20 s ) in the output pattern that should be converted to @xmath20 ( resp . , @xmath21 ) in order to make the computation conservative .",
    "this means that if we use a gate @xmath67 with @xmath68 input lines and @xmath69 output lines then we can compute @xmath70 in a conservative way as follows : @xmath71 where @xmath72 ( resp . , @xmath73 )",
    "is the @xmath74tuple consisting of all @xmath21 s ( resp .",
    ", @xmath20 s ) , and the pair @xmath75 is such that @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "as we can see , we use some additional input ( resp . ,",
    "output ) lines in order to provide ( resp . , remove ) the required ( resp . , exceeding )",
    "energy that allows @xmath67 to compute @xmath70 in a conservative way .",
    "it is easy to see that the same trick can be applied to generic @xmath0valued functions @xmath26 ; instead of the number of missing or exceeding @xmath21 s , we just compute the missing or exceeding number of energy units , and we provide an appropriate number of additional input and output lines .",
    "let us now introduce the notion of _ conservative computation_. let @xmath48 be the function computed by an @xmath27gate .",
    "moreover , let @xmath78 , @xmath79 be a sequence of elements from @xmath80 to be used as input patterns for the gate , and let @xmath81 be the corresponding sequence of output patterns from @xmath82 .",
    "let us consider the quantities @xmath83 for all @xmath84 ; note that , without loss of generality , by an appropriate rescaling we may assume that all @xmath85 s are integer values .",
    "we say that the _ computation _ of @xmath86 , obtained starting from @xmath87 , is _ conservative _ if the following condition holds : @xmath88 this condition formalizes the requirement that the total energy provided by _ all _ input patterns of @xmath87 is used to build all output patterns of @xmath86 . of course it may happen that @xmath89 or @xmath90 for some @xmath91 .",
    "in the former case the gate has an excess of energy that should be dissipated into the environment after the production of the value @xmath92 , whereas in the latter case the gate does not have enough energy to produce the desired output pattern .",
    "since we want to avoid these situations , we assume to perform computations through gates which are equipped with an internal _ accumulator _ ( also _ storage unit _ ) which is able to store a maximum amount @xmath16 of energy units .",
    "we call @xmath16 the _ capacity _ of the gate .",
    "the amount of energy contained into the internal storage unit at a given time can thus be used during the next computation step if the energy of the output pattern that must be produced is greater than the energy of the corresponding input pattern .",
    "if the output patterns @xmath93 , @xmath94 are computed exactly in this order then , assuming that the computation starts with no energy stored into the gate , it is not difficult to see that @xmath95 is the _ sequence of the amounts of energy stored _ into the gate during the computation of @xmath86 .",
    "we say that a given conservative computation is _",
    "@xmath16feasible _ if @xmath96 for all @xmath84 .",
    "notice that for conservative computations it always holds @xmath97 .    in some cases",
    "the order with which the output patterns of @xmath86 are computed does not matter .",
    "we can thus consider the following problem : given an @xmath27gate that computes the map @xmath48 , an input sequence @xmath98 and the corresponding output sequence @xmath99 , @xmath100 , is there a permutation @xmath101 ( the symmetrical group of order @xmath74 ) such that the computation of @xmath102 is @xmath16feasible ? this is a decision problem , whose relevant information is entirely provided by the values @xmath103 , which can be formally stated as follows .",
    "name : conscomp .",
    "* instance : a set @xmath104 of integer numbers such that @xmath105 , and an integer number @xmath106 .",
    "* question : is there a permutation @xmath101 such that @xmath107 @xmath108    the conscomp problem can be obviously solved by trying every possible permutation @xmath109 from @xmath110 .",
    "however , this procedure requires an exponential time with respect to @xmath74 , the length of the computation .",
    "a natural question is whether it is possible to give the correct answer in polynomial time . with the following theorem",
    "we show that the conscomp problem is np  complete .",
    "as it is well known @xcite , this means that if there would exist a polynomial time algorithm that solves the problem then we could immediately conclude that the two complexity classes p and np coincide , a very unlikely situation .",
    "conscomp is np  complete .",
    "[ teo : conscomp ]    conscomp is clearly in np , since a permutation @xmath101 has linear length and verifying whether @xmath109 is a solution can be done in polynomial time . in order to conclude that conscomp is np  complete , let us show a polynomial reduction from partition , which is a well known np ",
    "complete problem @xcite .",
    "let @xmath111 be a set of positive integer numbers , and let @xmath112 .",
    "the set @xmath113 is a positive instance of partition if and only if there exists a set @xmath114 such that @xmath115 . if @xmath24 is odd then @xmath113 is certainly a negative instance , and we can associate it to any negative instance of conscomp . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath24 is even we build the corresponding instance @xmath116 of conscomp by putting @xmath117 and @xmath118 , where @xmath119 for all @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "it is immediately seen that this construction can be performed in polynomial time .",
    "we claim that @xmath113 is a positive instance of partition if and only if @xmath116 is a positive instance of conscomp .",
    "in fact , let us assume that @xmath113 is a positive instance of partition .",
    "then there exists a set @xmath114 such that @xmath122 , and the corresponding negative elements of @xmath123 constitute a subset @xmath124 such that @xmath125 .",
    "we build a permutation @xmath101 by selecting first the element @xmath126 followed by the elements of @xmath124 ( chosen with any order ) , and then @xmath127 followed by the remaining elements of @xmath123 .",
    "it is immediately seen that @xmath109 satisfies the inequalities stated in , and hence @xmath116 is a positive instance of conscomp .",
    "conversely , let us assume that @xmath116 is a positive instance of conscomp .",
    "then there exists a permutation @xmath101 that satisfies the inequalities stated in .",
    "since the first chosen element can not be negative , it must necessarily be @xmath128 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath117 , the second @xmath128 can be chosen if and only if the energy stored into the gate is zero , that is , if and only if there exists a set @xmath129 of negative elements whose sum is equal to @xmath130 .",
    "the opposites of these elements constitute a set @xmath114 such that @xmath115 , and thus we can conclude that @xmath113 is a positive instance of partition .",
    "in this section we introduce a framework which can be used to define and study energy  based properties of computations performed by @xmath131gates .",
    "the crucial idea of our framework is that we look at computations as a sequence of _ conditional movements _ of energy . that is , the gate computes its output pattern as follows : for a given subset of input lines , a condition on their values is checked ; if this condition is verified then a given action is performed , transforming such values , otherwise no transformation is applied .",
    "successively , another condition is checked on another subset of lines ( comprising the output lines from the first step of computation ) , which determines whether another action has to be performed , and so on until the required values are obtained on the output lines .    to realize the gate according to the above procedure , we need a ( boolean ) _ control equipment _ , and two _ primitives _ to conditionally move energy from a given line to another one .",
    "we call these primitives _",
    "conditional up _ ( cup ) and _ conditional down _ ( cdown ) .",
    "the realization of the gate can thus be viewed as a circuit composed by these simpler elements .",
    "let us first describe cup and cdown as @xmath0valued gates . in the following , we will provide a quantum realization as formulas composed of creation and annihilation operators on @xmath1 , as we have done for the gates presented in @xcite .",
    "the cup gate is depicted in figure [ fig : figures ] ( a ) .",
    "it is a @xmath132gate whose behavior is :    : @xmath133    @xmath134    @xmath135    @xmath136    as we can see , @xmath137 is a control line whose input value is returned unchanged . the condition @xmath138 enables the movement of a quantity @xmath35 of energy from the third to the second line . of course",
    ", this action is performed only if possible , that is , only if @xmath139 and @xmath140 ( equivalently , if the energy values associated to the second and third line are not @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively ) . if these conditions are not satisfied , or if @xmath143 , then the gate behaves as the identity .",
    "starting from this description , for any integer @xmath17 we can easily write the truth table of the @xmath0valued cup gate .",
    "analogously , the behavior of the complementary @xmath132gate cdown is :    : @xmath133    @xmath134    @xmath144    @xmath136    let us note that @xmath145 can be obtained from @xmath146 ( and vice versa ) by exchanging the second and the third line before and after the application of cup .",
    "figure [ fig : figures ] ( b ) shows how , using the boolean versions of cup and cdown gates , we can implement the boolean fredkin ( controlled switch ) gate . since the fredkin gate is functionally complete for boolean logic , using only two  valued cup and cdown gates we can realize any boolean circuit",
    ". in principle these boolean circuits , together with @xmath0valued cup s and cdown s , can realize any conditional movement of energy , that is , any conceivable computation that can be performed by @xmath131gates .",
    "it is clear that implementing a gate , be it conservative or not , using only these primitives allows one to visualize the movement of energy between different parts of the gate during a computation .",
    "such visualization may help us to optimize some aspects of the implementation of the gate , namely , the amount of energy moved and the extension of energy jumps .",
    "as shown in @xcite , such optimizations can be obtained by splitting ( if possible ) a given @xmath147gate @xmath148 into @xmath74 blocks , so that its computation can be performed by an appropriate @xmath149gate @xmath150 equipped with a storage unit of capacity @xmath16 .",
    "however , the minimization of the amount of energy moved between different parts of @xmath148 during the computation is equivalent to the minimization of @xmath16 , and hence it constitutes an np  hard problem , whose decision version is the np  complete problem conscomp .",
    "this means that the reorganization of the internal machinery of @xmath148 to optimize the movements of energy is considered a difficult problem .",
    "now let us turn to the quantum realization of cup and cdown .",
    "generally , a quantum gate acts on memory cells that are @xmath0level quantum systems called _ qudits _ ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "a qudit is typically implemented using the energy levels of an atom or a nuclear spin .",
    "the mathematical description  independent of the practical realization  of a single qudit is based on the @xmath0dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath151 . in particular , the truth values of @xmath22 are represented by the unit vectors of the canonical orthonormal basis , called the _ computational basis _ of @xmath151 : @xmath152    a collection of @xmath23 qudits is called a _ quantum register _ of size @xmath23 .",
    "it is mathematically described by the hilbert space @xmath153 .",
    "an @xmath23_configuration _ is a vector @xmath154 , simply written as @xmath155 , for @xmath43 running on @xmath22 .",
    "an @xmath23configuration can be viewed as the quantum realization of the `` classical '' pattern @xmath156 .",
    "let us recall that the dimension of @xmath157 is @xmath158 and that the set @xmath159 of all @xmath23configurations is an orthonormal basis of this space , called the @xmath23_register computational basis_.    unlike the situation of the classical wired computer where voltages of a wire go over voltages of another , in quantum realizations of classical gates something different happens .",
    "first of all , in this setting every gate must have the same number of input and output lines ( that is , they must be @xmath160gates ) .",
    "each qudit of a given register configuration @xmath155 ( quantum realization of an input pattern ) is in some particular quantum state @xmath161 and an operation @xmath162 is performed which transforms this configuration into a new configuration @xmath163 , which is the quantum realization of an output pattern . in other words ,",
    "a quantum realization of an @xmath160gate is a linear operator @xmath150 that transforms vectors of the @xmath23register computational basis into vectors of the same basis .",
    "the action of @xmath150 on a non  factorized vector , expressed as a linear combination of the elements of the @xmath23register basis , is obtained by linearity .",
    "the collection of all linear operators on @xmath1 is a @xmath164dimensional linear space whose canonical basis is : @xmath165 since @xmath166 and @xmath167 for every @xmath168 such that @xmath169 , this operator transforms the unit vector @xmath170 into the unit vector @xmath171 , collapsing all the other vectors of the canonical orthonormal basis of @xmath1 into the null vector . for @xmath172 ,",
    "the operator @xmath173 can be represented as an order @xmath0 square matrix having @xmath21 in position @xmath174 and @xmath20 in every other position : @xmath175    each of the operators @xmath176 can be expressed , using the whole algebraic structure of the associative algebra of operators , as a suitable composition of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "an alternative approach , that uses spin  creation and spin  annihilation operators , is shown in @xcite .",
    "we recall that the actions of the _ creation _ operator @xmath177 and of the _ annihilation _ operator @xmath178 on the vectors of the canonical orthonormal basis of @xmath1 are @xmath179 and @xmath180 respectively .",

    "let @xmath191 be a generic row of the truth table of an @xmath190gate .",
    "for what we have said above , the operator @xmath192 transforms the input configuration @xmath193 into the output configuration @xmath194 , and collapses all the other input configurations of the @xmath23register basis to the null vector .",
    "it is not difficult to see that if @xmath195 are the `` local '' operators associated to the @xmath158 rows of the truth table , then the operator @xmath196 is a quantum realization of the @xmath190gate .",
    "notice that the resulting operator @xmath197 is not necessarily a unitary operator .",
    "starting from the truth tables of the @xmath0valued gates cup and cdown we can thus build the corresponding linear operators that realize them .",
    "for example , it is not difficult to see that the non  unitary linear operator  acting on the hilbert space @xmath198  which realizes the boolean cup gate is : @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the identity operator of @xmath201 and , for the sake of clearness , we have written @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 ( resp . ,",
    "@xmath137 , @xmath178 , @xmath205 ) to denote the creation ( resp . ,",

    "let us note that the use of creation and annihilation operators allows for different physical implementations .",
    "for example , we can view computation not only as a conditional movement of energy but also as a conditional movement of particles between systems that may contain at most @xmath214 of particles .",
    "alternatively , we can view computation as a sequence of conditional switches of the value of the @xmath215 component of the angular momentum of microscopical physical systems , using spin  creation and spin  annihilation instead of creation and annihilation operators @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have proposed the first steps towards a theory of conservative computing , where the amount of energy associated to the data which are manipulated during the computations is preserved .",
    "the first obvious extension of our model is to take into account the energy used to perform computations , that is , to transform input values into output values .",
    "a first idea is to consider some additional _ power source _ input lines and _ dissipation _ output lines .",
    "power source lines are fixed to a constant value from @xmath22 ( usually @xmath21 ) , and absorb energy from the environment .",
    "this energy is entirely consumed during the computation , whereas all the energy associated to the input pattern is returned by the output pattern . on the other hand ,",
    "dissipation lines are used to model the release of energy into the environment ; hence , their value is simply discarded .",
    "conservative gates constitute a special case in our framework , where there are neither power source nor dissipation lines ( under the hypothesis that we do not take into account the energy needed to perform the computation ) .",
    "since perfect conservation of energy can be obtained only in theory , a second possibility for future work could be to relax the conservativeness constraint , by assuming that the amount of energy dissipated during a computation step is not greater than a fixed value .",
    "analogously , we can suppose that if we try to store an amount of energy that exceeds the capacity of the gate then the energy which can not be stored is dissipated .",
    "in such a case it should be interesting to study trade - offs between the amount of energy dissipated and the hardness of the corresponding modified conscomp problem .",
    "finally , it remains to study how to theoretically model and physically realize gates equipped with an internal storage unit .",
    "here we just observe that , from a theoretical point of view , it seems appropriate to consider this kind of gates as finite state automata , by viewing the energy levels of the storage unit as their states .",

    "<S> we extend the notion of conservativeness , given by fredkin and toffoli in 1982 , to generic gates whose input and output lines may assume a finite number @xmath0 of truth values . a physical interpretation of conservativeness in terms of conservation of the energy associated to the data used during the computation is given . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we define _ conservative computations _ , and we show that they naturally induce a new np  complete decision problem . finally , we present a framework that can be used to explicit the movement of energy occurring during a computation , and we provide a quantum implementation of the primitives of such framework using creation and annihilation operators on the hilbert space @xmath1 , where @xmath0 is the number of energy levels considered in the framework . </S>"
