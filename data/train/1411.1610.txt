    "one can find that there exist many reasons and motivations to consider alternative theories of gravity to the general relativity .",
    "some theories are motivated by the modifications in infrared regime and they mainly aim to resolve a question about the dark energy .",
    "for instance , @xmath0 gravity @xcite can explain the accelerating expansion of current universe without the cosmological constant and avoid the hierarchy problem .",
    "others are motivated by the modifications in ultraviolet regime and they are often associated with the effects of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "higher - curvature theories typified by curvature - squared and the gauss - bonnet terms are induced from quantum corrections . naturally , challenges to the theory beyond general relativity themselves are important because there is no fundamental reason to choose the einstein - hilbert action or einstein s equation over many kind of alternatives .",
    "recently , much attention has been paid to bi - metric theory or what we call bigravity , which includes two independent metric tensor fields , @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "bigravity contains massive spin-@xmath3 propagating mode in addition to ordinary massless spin-@xmath3 mode corresponding to the graviton .",
    "this theory has been successfully constructed as the generalization of drgt massive gravity in recent years @xcite .",
    "some people expect that the new degrees of freedom introduced by another metric can solve remaining problems in cosmology , that is , dark energy @xcite and dark matter @xcite problems .",
    "interactions between two metric tensors produce effective cosmological constant , furthermore , the massive spin-@xmath3 fields and matter fields coupled with the metric @xmath2 can be candidates of dark matter .    when we intend to view the bigravity to be an alternative theory of gravity , it is also interesting that we apply this theory to other phenomena in cosmology or astrophysics and find the differences from general relativity . in our work , we focus on the nature of black holes .",
    "it is well known that the horizon radius of the black hole in the vacuum usually decreases by the hawking radiation .",
    "however , bousso and hawking have observed a phenomenon where the black hole radius increases by the quantum correction for the specific nariai black hole @xcite . this phenomenon is called anti - evaporation of black holes .",
    "note that the schwarzschild - de sitter black holes and the nariai black holes can be primordial ones , thus , they are not expected to appear at the final stage of star collapse .    in order that the anti - evaporation could occur in the einstein gravity , we need to include the quantum correction from the matters",
    ". it might be remarkable , however , that the anti - evaporation may occur even on the classical level in @xmath0 gravity theories @xcite .",
    "this could be because that the equations for the @xmath0 gravity are more complicated than those for the einstein gravity , but at present , it is not so clear what could be essential for the anti - evaporation on the classical level",
    ". then it might be interesting if the anti - evaporation in the classical level might be a general phenomena in the modified gravity . in this paper",
    ", we consider the possibility of the anti - evaporation in bigravity on the classical level because the contribution from the interaction between two metric tensors is not so trivial .",
    "we will give a classical analysis in the stability of the nariai black hole in the bigravity and study if the anti - evaporation could occur in the classical level , which may clarify what could be necessary for the anti - evaporation to occur .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : first , we explain about the nariai black hole .",
    "the nariai black hole is defined as a subset of the schwarzschild - de sitter black hole where the radii of the cosmological and black hole horizons are degenerate .",
    "second , we give a brief review about the bigravity . in order to show the existence of the nariai black hole as an exact solution in the bigravity , we specify some parameters and solutions , then",
    ", we give a proof that the asymptotically de sitter solutions can be realized .",
    "finally , we consider the perturbations around the black hole and evaluate their stability and investigate if the anti - evaporation could occur on the classical level .",
    "at first , we introduce the nariai space - time as a family of the schwarzschild - de sitter space - time . the schwarzschild - de sitter solution is expressed in the following form : @xmath4 where the function @xmath5 is defined by @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is a mass parameter and @xmath8 is a positive cosmological constant . for @xmath9 , @xmath5 has two positive roots @xmath10 and @xmath11 , corresponding to the cosmological and black hole horizon , respectively . in the limit @xmath12 ,",
    "the radius of the black hole horizon coincide with that of the cosmological horizon . here , the coordinate system in eq .",
    "( [ polar coordinate ] ) becomes inappropriate because @xmath13 between the two horizons .",
    "then it is useful to introduce new coordinate system as follows : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the parameter defined as @xmath16 , and @xmath17 corresponds to the degeneracy of two horizons .    in above",
    "coordinate , the black hole horizon corresponds to @xmath18 and the cosmological horizon corresponds to @xmath19 , and the metric takes the following form : @xmath20 in the degenerate case , @xmath21 , the metric is given by @xmath22 and this space - time is called the nariai black hole .",
    "note that the topology of the space - like sections of the schwarzschild - de sitter space - time ( and the nariai space - time ) is @xmath23 while that of the ordinary black hole solution is @xmath24 in four dimensions . in this coordinate system ,",
    "the radius of two - sphere , @xmath25 , varies along the one - sphere coordinate , @xmath26 ; the minimal two - sphere corresponds to the black hole horizon and the maximal one corresponds to the cosmological horizon .      in this section",
    ", we give a brief review of the anti - evaporation in general relativity .",
    "first of all , we begin with the hawking radiation from the black holes .",
    "it is well known that there is radiation by the quantum effects of matter fields around the black hole horizon , which is called the hawking radiation .",
    "this quantum corrections leads to the trace anomaly of the energy - momentum tensor although the trace of the energy - momentum tensor should classically vanish , @xmath27 .",
    "when we consider the massless scalar as the hawking radiation , the effective action corresponding to the trace anomaly is written by a covariant form @xcite , @xmath28\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the effective action is reduced to two dimensional form , and @xmath29 is the redundancy parameter corresponding to the renormalization scheme .",
    "the above effective action leads to the modification for the equation of motion . in general relativity ,",
    "specific perturbations around the nariai black holes shrink from its initial values .",
    "then , the size of black hole horizon increases at least initially .",
    "this phenomena is called anti - evaporation .",
    "note that if we do not include the quantum correction , the anti - evaporation does not occur and the horizon size remains in that of the initial perturbation .",
    "we should note that in case of the @xmath0 gravity , there occurs the anti - evaporation even on the classical level , that is , without quantum correction @xcite . in the @xmath0 gravity ,",
    "the equations are complicated , which may generate the the anti - evaporation on the classical level . because the equations in the bigravity are also pretty complicated",
    ", we may expect that the anti - evaporation could occur on the classical level , and therefore , it could be interesting to investigate the anti - evaporation in the bigravity even if on the classical level .",
    "in this section , we give a brief review of the bigravity and show that the nariai space - time is an exact solution in this theory .",
