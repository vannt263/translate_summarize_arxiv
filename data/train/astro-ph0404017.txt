    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , with an angular extent of @xmath210@xmath3@xmath45@xmath3 well matched to the fields of view of the ibis @xcite and spi @xcite instruments , is an ideal target to exploit the multiplexing capabilities of integral .",
    "being the closest galaxy ( d@xmath254 kpc ) , the lmc has always been a primary target for all x - ray and @xmath5-ray missions .",
    "it contains a few luminous x - ray binaries , that have been extensively studied in x - rays , but for which little information has been obtained above @xmath220 - 30 kev . besides giving information on the brightest sources , an integral survey of the lmc should allow studies of diffuse emission , and to discover new fainter hard x - ray sources .",
    "integral observed the lmc for about 1 msec in january 2003 and for about 400 ksec in january 2004 .",
    "fig.[jemx - im ] shows the images of the lmc field obtained with the jem - x instrument @xcite in the energy ranges 3 - 5 kev and 5 - 10 kev .    here",
    "we present the preliminary results on the brightest sources detected in this field with ibis : the black hole candidate lmc x-1 , the low mass x - ray binary exo 0748676 , and the agn iras 045757537 .",
    "the two latter sources do not belong to the lmc , but were serendipitously detected in the large ibis field of view . as can be seen in fig.[jemx - im ] , also lmc x-2 , lmc x-3 and lmc x-4 were clearly detected .",
    "lmc x-2 is a low mass x - ray binary containing a neutron star , and the only z - type source known out of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "lmc x-3 is a persistent black hole candidate @xcite which spends most of the time in a soft spectral state , with a very faint power law tail at high energies . due to their soft spectrum and",
    "relatively low flux , lmc x-2 and lmc x-3 were not detected in the preliminary analysis of the ibis data carried out to date .",
    "lmc x-1 is a persistent black hole candidate ( bhc ) with an accurately measured mass function ( 0.14 @xmath6 , @xcite ) . the most likely mass for the compact object is @xmath24 @xmath6 . to date",
    ", this bhc has always been found in a typical high / soft state with luminosity l@xmath7@xmath22 10@xmath8 erg s@xmath9 and a spectrum well described by a disk - blackbody component with rather constant temperature @xmath20.9 kev plus a variable , steep power - law tail with photon index @xmath102.53 @xcite .",
    "previous high - energy observations detected lmc x-1 up to @xmath260 kev , but they were carried out with non - imaging instruments and might have suffered from confusion problems , in particular due to the nearby radio pulsar psr 054069 , which lies at an angular distance of @xmath225 arcmin .",
    "with isgri we obtained the first images of lmc x-1 above 20 kev ( see fig.[lmcx1-im ] ) .",
    "we performed a joint spectral analysis of the 2003 data from isgri and jem - x .",
    "the resulting spectrum is shown in fig.[lmcx1-sp ] .",
    "the best fit parameters for a model composed by a disk blackbody @xcite plus a power - law ( kt@xmath11=1.9@xmath120.5 kev , photon index = 2.7@xmath120.4 ) are quite different from those found in previous observations of this source",
    ". this might simply reflect systematics in the low energy calibration currently available for jem - x .",
    "exo 0784676 is a dipping low mass x - ray binary containing a neutron star .",
    "it has been extensively studied at low energies ( @xmath1310 kev ) , where it shows all types of variability typical of the different kinds of lmxrb : eclipses , dips , flares and type i bursts @xcite .",
    "this source is not located in the lmc , but falls serendipitously in the ibis field of view of our observations , and , despite its rather large off - axis angle it has been detected in all the energy bands of our isgri mosaic ( see fig.[exo - im ] ) .",
    "fig.[exo - sp ] shows its spectrum as measured with isgri .",
    "it is well fit by a cut - off power law with photon index @xmath21.4 and @xmath14=50 kev . the time averaged flux in the 20 - 100 kev range was 2@xmath15 erg @xmath16 s@xmath9 , about 40% lower than that measured by the bepposax pds instrument in november 2000 @xcite",
    "iras 045757537 is a background agn falling in the lmc field .",
    "it is associated with a rather bright barred spiral galaxy at redshift z=0.0184 and showing a strong infrared emission @xcite .",
    "iras 045757537 was first detected in the x - ray range with heao-1 , and later observed with rosat , ginga and asca @xcite .",
    "it is classified as a seyfert 2 galaxy .    in our observations it was quite faint ( @xmath23 mcrab ) and detected with a signal to noise of 7 in the two lower energy bands of the isgri mosaic .",
    "we have derived two spectral points and an upper limit , which represent the first measurement of this agn at these energies .",
    "the flux is about 1.1@xmath17 erg @xmath16 s@xmath9 ( 20 - 40 kev ) .",
    "extrapolating the oserved spectrum to higher energies would imply a 20 - 100 kev luminosity of 5@xmath18 erg s@xmath9 , comparable to that in the far infrared band @xcite .",
