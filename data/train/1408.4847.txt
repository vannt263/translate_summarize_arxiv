    "topological insulating states , such as the topological band insulator ( tbi ) , the topological mott insulator , and other interacting varieties of topological states have been attracted much interest in condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "these topological insulating states are characterized by topological numbers , such as the chern number , mirror chern number , and the @xmath0 number@xcite .",
    "the tbi have been experimentally found in many materials , such as @xmath1 , and @xmath2 quantum wells@xcite . besides the experimental progress in the detection of topological insulating states , much theoretical research has been devoted to the role of lattice geometry on the topological insulating states , including the honeycomb , square , kagome , and more unusual lattices @xcite .",
    "in addition to geometric factors , topological phase transitions can also be induced by a staggered on - site energy@xcite , rashba spin - orbit coupling@xcite , and a third - neighbor hopping in non - interacting models @xcite .",
    "recently , the influence of electronic correlations on topological states has been the focus of many studies . in the strong coupling limit , interactions could induce magnetic ordering which either breaks the time reversal symmetry , which then spoils the tbi state@xcite , or coexists with the topological phases to form an anti - ferromagnetic topological insulator@xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the topological phase transitions @xcite at strong interactions and how finite temperatures influence topological states @xcite .",
    "in particular , interactions and thermal fluctuations have been proposed to drive a nontrivial tbi or otherwise change topological properties@xcite .",
    "thus , it is highly desirable to investigate the effect of interactions on topological systems , particularly at finite temperature , which is important and relevant to real materials .",
    "many analytical and numerical methods have been developed to investigate interacting systems in the past few years @xcite , among them dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) is an especially powerful method capable of capturing the mott transition @xcite .",
    "while single - site dmft has been shown to work well in three dimensional systems ( it is exact in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions ) , in two - dimensional systems non - local correlations and spatial fluctuations can have an important influence on the physics . to improve the predictions of dmft , particularly in two - dimensions , cellular dynamical mean - field theory ( cdmft )",
    "@xcite has been developed to incorporate spatially extended correlations . in cdmft",
    ", the original lattice is mapped to an effective cluster impurity model coupled to an effective medium .",
    "an important impurity solver in cdmft uses the continuous time quantum monte carlo method ( ctqmc ) @xcite , which is more accurate than the  traditional \" discrete - time qmc method .",
    "the momentum - dependent spectral function can be used to detect the different characters of the edge states appearing in the topologically trivial and non - trivial states .",
    "in addition , topological phase transitions can also be studied by observing the spin chern number directly in the model we consider because it conserves the @xmath3-component of the spin.@xcite        in this work , we investigate topological phase transitions in an interacting honeycomb lattice model ( a generalized kane - mele - hubbard model ",

    ", it appears that topological phase transitions may be directly observed experimentally .",
    "in addition to a change in the topological invariants , topological phase transitions can also be signaled by a gap closing .",
    "in contrast to the zero temperature case@xcite , the gapless dirac cone structures at the topological phase boundary give rise to a finite - ranged ( in terms of third - neighbor hopping ) metallic state at finite temperatures and finite interactions . this intermediate phase exhibits a spin hall effect . under strong interactions , an xy - easy plane anti -",
    "ferromagnetic insulating state is observed for all values of @xmath4 when the interaction @xmath9 is beyond a critical value .",
    "thus , there is no topological phase transition in the strong coupling limit .",
    "one of our main results is the finite temperature phase diagram fig.[fig : phase_diagram ] , given in terms of the interaction strength and the third neighbor hopping .",
    "these interesting phases could be experimentally probed by transport , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite , neutron scattering , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite , and other experiments . for interaction values below the critical strength required to induce a magnetic transition , our results are in good quantitative agreement with recent fermion - sign free quantum monte carlo calculations on the same model@xcite .",
