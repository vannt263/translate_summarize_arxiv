    "in this paper , we shall be concerned with the direct and inverse problems associated with the time - harmonic acoustic scattering described by the helmholtz system as follows .",

    "let @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , be a potential function .",
    "@xmath4 signifies the material parameter of the medium at the point @xmath5 and it is related to the so - called refractive index in our study .",
    "it is assumed that after normalisation , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a bounded domain in @xmath8 .",
    "that is , the inhomogeneity of the medium has a compact support .    in the setup of our study ,",
    "one sends an incident wave field to interrogate the medium @xmath9 , which is a common means in wave probing .",
    "the medium @xmath9 perturbs the incident wave and create a total wave field .",
    "we let @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , denote the incident and total wave fields .",
    "@xmath10 is an entire solution to the helmholtz equation @xmath12 and @xmath11 satisfies @xmath13 in @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , the scattered wave @xmath15 satisfies the sommerfeld radiation condition @xmath16 uniformly with respect to the angular variable as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the derivative along the radial direction from the origin .",
    "the radiation condition implies the existence of a far - field pattern . more precisely there is a real - analytic function on the unit - sphere at infinity @xmath19 such that @xmath20 uniformly along the angular variable @xmath21 .",
    "this function is called the _ far - field pattern _ or _ scattering amplitude _ of @xmath11 .",
    "the inverse scattering problem that we are concerned with is to recover @xmath9 from the knowledge of @xmath22 and the direct scattering problem that we are concerned with is to investigate under what circumstance , one would have @xmath23 .",
    "this inverse scattering problem serves as a prototype model to many inverse problems arising from scientific and technological applications @xcite .",
    "the concerned direct scattering problem is related to a significant engineering application , the so - called _ invisibility cloaking _ ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    concerning the direct scattering problem described above , it is proved in @xcite that if @xmath24 , then the support of @xmath9 can not have a @xmath25 corner in @xmath14 . in @xcite",
    ", it is further shown that under similar conditions , the support of @xmath9 can not have a conical corner in @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "more recently , in @xcite , the authors show that any penetrable scatterer having a corner or an edge and a real - analytic refractive index function scatters every non - trivial incident wave .",
    "the same was shown to be true for less regular functions in @xcite .",
    "these results mean that a penetrable corner scatters every incident wave non - trivially .",
    "particularly , it implies that one can not achieve ideal invisibility with a generic regular isotropic medium if there is a corner on the cloaking device . using the corner scattering result in @xcite , the authors in @xcite considered the inverse scattering problem .",
    "it is shown that if two medium scatterers @xmath9 and @xmath28 produce the same scattering amplitude , namely @xmath29 ( where and also in what follows , @xmath30 signifies the far - field pattern / scattering amplitude associated with @xmath28 corresponding to the incident field @xmath10 ) , then difference of the supports of @xmath9 and @xmath28 , namely @xmath31 , can not have a corner of the type that appeared in the previous papers .",
    "this means , in particular , that in the set of convex polygonal or rectangular cuboidal penetrable scatterers the far - field pattern produced by sending any single incident wave determines the shape of the scatterer , disregarding its medium content . in what follows ,",
    "some remarks are in order concerning the significance of the aforementioned results .    in inverse scattering theory ,",
    "shape determination by minimal or optimal measurement data remains a longstanding open problem @xcite .",
    "it has been long conjectured that one can uniquely determine the shape of an impenetrable scatterer by a single far - field measurement .",
    "significant progress has been achieved in recent years in uniquely recovering impenetrable polyhedral scatterers by minimal numbers of far - field measurements ; see @xcite for related unique recovery results , and @xcite for optimal stability estimates . however , the shape determination of a penetrable medium scatterer by a minimal number of far - field measurements is rarely known in the literature .",
    "in addition to its significance in inverse scattering theory , the related study is also at the heart of invisibility cloaking , which has received significant attention in the scientific community in recent years due to its practical importance .",
    "blueprints for achieving invisibility via the use of the artificially engineered _ metamaterials _ were proposed in @xcite .",
    "those materials are anisotropic and singular .",
    "it is of scientific curiosity and practical importance to know whether one can achieve the invisibility by regular materials .",
    "clearly , the answer is negative if there is a corner on the cloaking device .    in this article",
    ", we aim to sharply quantify the aforementioned results in @xcite on corner scattering and in @xcite on the shape determination by a single far - field pattern .",
    "more precisely , we show that for inhomogeneous medium scatterers supported on a polygon , the energy of the scattering amplitude possesses a positive lower bound , depending only on the size of the corner as well as the refractive index of the medium there . as a surprising consequence ,",
    "we give evidence against a widespread folk - telling result in the literature .",
    "indeed , it is widely believed that one can generate a set of nearly non - scattering interrogating wave fields by approximating the corresponding interior transmission eigenfunction associated with an inhomogeneous medium by herglotz waves ; see , e.g. , @xcite . as for shape determination , we establish logarithmic estimates in determining the shape of a medium scatter supported in a 2d polygonal or 3d rectangular domain .",
    "it can be roughly stated that given two penetrable medium corners @xmath9 and @xmath28 , and a common incident wave @xmath10 , assuming that the far - field patterns of the corresponding scattered waves @xmath15 and @xmath32 are @xmath33-close to one another , then the supports of @xmath9 and @xmath28 are @xmath34-close in the sense of hausdorff distance . here",
    ", in our study , @xmath35 is of doubly logarithmic type .    due to technical reasons ,",
    "we first derive the stability estimates in the shape determination by a single far - field pattern .",
    "the stability of corner scattering for plane waves follows conveniently then .",
    "our mathematical arguments will be based on quantifying the estimates and coefficients arising in the proofs of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we state our results in section [ sect : results ] and prove them in section [ sect : proofs ] . however , there are substantially new challenges and new developments .",
    "the first challenge comes from the different points of view of scatterer probing and always scattering corners : in probing , the philosophy is to use optimal incident waves to recover as much information about the scatterer as possible . in corner scattering ,",
    "on the other hand , we are given an arbitrary incident wave and want to show non - vanishing of the far - field pattern .",
    "we can not both choose an optimal incident wave and have an arbitrary one .",
    "the associated methods and estimates will work for one , but be overly complicated for the other .",
    "therefor in this first paper on stability we have decided to focus on scatterer probing , which is best done with non - vanishing waves such as plane waves .    a large mathematical challenge is to prove a quantitative rellich s theorem .",
    "as it is well known in scattering theory , a vanishing far - field pattern means a scattered wave that is trivial outside the scattering object @xcite . for stability in",
    "inverse scattering one requires that a small scattering amplitude corresponds to a small scattered wave .",
    "these types of results are well - known for the impenetrable case in the literature .",
    "a quantitative rellich s theorem for the penetrable case is much less studied . typically , in showing stability for inverse scattering",
    ", the far - field data is reduced to the dirichlet - neumann map as in @xcite .",
    "however this map is not well suited for our case since we are interested in _ a single incident wave _ and the associated far - field pattern of the scattered wave .",
    "therefor we prove a quantitative rellich s theorem for penetrable scatterers in section [ sect : ff2scat ] .",
    "there are two major issues compared to the impenetrable case : a ) we do not have a boundary condition for the total wave at the boundary of the scatterer , and b ) in the case of support probing the arbitrary positions of the two scatterers causes geometrical issues , for example by producing sharp inwards corners in the union of the two supports .",
    "we solve the second issue by propagating the smallness from infinity to the boundary of the convex hull of the two supports and prove geometrical results about the magnitudes of related angles .",
    "the earlier issue is more problematic .",
    "we can not use quantitative unique continuation to propagate smallness all the way into the boundary of the convex hull , as the associated function stops being real - analytic there . dealing with this issue",
    "is the source of the two logarithms in our stability estimates .    after solving the two previous challenges the rest of the problems seem like usual smooth sailing : quantifying the norms arising in _ complex geometrical optics solutions _ estimates that were first considered in @xcite , estimating the terms arising from the various function expansion first suggested in @xcite and combining all into proofs of our theorems .    the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we define notations in the next section , which will help with stating the main theorems in section [ sect : results ] .",
    "the proof idea is described in section [ sect : ideas ] .",
