    "over the past 21 years , more than 130 pulsars have been discovered in globular clusters ( gcs ) . among the first discoveries were psr  b1516 + 02a and psr  b1516 + 02b @xcite .",
    "both are located in the gc ngc  5904 .",
    "this cluster is also known as m5 and we refer to these pulsars below as m5a and m5b .",
    "m5a is an isolated millisecond pulsar ( msp ) with a spin period of 5.55 ms .",
    "m5b is a 7.95-ms pulsar in a binary system with a low - mass companion ( see  [ sec : masses ] ) and an orbital period of 6.86 days . at the time of its discovery ,",
    "this was the msp with the most eccentric orbit known ( @xmath2 ) , this being @xmath10 times larger than that of msp - white dwarf ( wd ) systems in the galactic disk with similar orbital periods .    in the galactic disk , 80% of all known msps",
    "are found to be in binary systems and , with the single exception of psr  j1903 + 0327 ( champion et al .",
    "2008 ) , they are in low - eccentricity orbits with wd companions . in gcs , gravitational interactions with neighboring stars , or even exchange encounters , can produce binary systems with eccentric orbits @xcite .",
    "these high eccentricities allow the measurement of post - keplerian parameters such as the rate of advance of periastron ( @xmath11 ) or , in the future , the einstein delay ( @xmath12 ) that are not normally measurable in msp binaries in the galactic disk .",
    "if these effects are relativistic , they allow estimates of the the total binary and component masses .    when anderson  et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) published timing solutions for m5a and b they used the eccentricity of m5b to detect its periastron advance .",
    "however , the large relative uncertainty of the measurement did not allow any astrophysically useful constraints on the total mass of the binary .",
    "in this paper we report the results of recent ( 2001 to 2008 ) 1.1 - 1.6  ghz ( l - band ) observations of m5 .",
    "the first 2001 observations were part of an arecibo search for pulsars in gcs , which found 11 new msps @xcite .",
    "three of these were found in m5 , and subsequent observations of this gc were made chiefly with the aim of timing these new discoveries ( stairs et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "m5a and b are in the same radio beam as the new pulsars and they are clearly detectable in the l - band data , permitting timing ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] and [ fig : residuals ] ) of much better ( m5a ) or comparable ( m5b ) quality to that obtained at 430 mhz by anderson et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "the whole dataset now spans nearly 19 years and provides much improved timing parameters .",
    "m5a and b were observed with the arecibo 305-m radio telescope from the time of their discovery in 1989 april until 1994 july using the 430-mhz carriage house line feed . for this , a 10-mhz band centered at 430  mhz was used .",
    "the arecibo correlation spectrometer made a 3-level quantization of the signal and correlated this for a total of 128 lags .",
    "these data were then integrated for 506.58561 @xmath13s , and the orthogonal polarizations added in quadrature before being written to magnetic tape .",
    "the l - band observations began in 2001 june , using the `` old '' gregorian l - wide receiver ( @xmath14 = 40  k at 1400 mhz ) .",
    "the `` new '' l - wide receiver ( @xmath15k at 1400 mhz ) has been used since it was installed in the gregorian dome in 2003 february .",
    "the wide - band arecibo pulsar processors ( wapps , dowd , sisk & hagen 2000 ) make a 3-level digitization of the voltages over a 100-mhz band for both ( linear ) polarizations , autocorrelating these for a total of 256 lags .",
    "the data are then integrated for a total of 64@xmath16s and the orthogonal polarizations added in quadrature and written to disk . at first , only one wapp was available , and centered the observing band at 1170  mhz or 1425  mhz . from 2003 ,",
    "three more wapps have been available , and we now use three of them to observe simultaneously at 1170 , 1410 and 1510  mhz , the cleanest bands within the wide frequency coverage of the new l - wide receiver .    for all observations , the lags were fourier transformed to generate power spectra . for the l - band observations , the power spectra were partially dedispersed at a dispersion measure ( dm ) of 29.5  @xmath17pc and stored as a set of 16 sub - bands on the disks of the borg computer cluster at mcgill university . at 1170  mhz",
    ", the partial dedispersion introduces an extra smearing of 18 and 1.6@xmath13s for m5a and b respectively . adding these values in quadrature to the dispersive smearing per channel ( 60.9 and 59.7 @xmath13s respectively )",
    ", we obtain a total dispersive smearing of 63.5 and 59.7 @xmath13s for m5a and b respectively , i.e. , the sub - banding introduces very little extra smearing .",
    "the 430-mhz power spectra and l - band sub - bands were dedispersed at the known dm of these pulsars and folded modulo their spin periods .",
    "all the l - band data reported in this paper were processed using the presto pulsar software packagesransom / presto ] .",
    "we added the best 1170 mhz detections of both pulsars to derive `` standard '' pulse profiles , and these are displayed in figure  [ fig : profiles ] .",
    "a minimal set of gaussian curves were fitted to these profiles to derive synthetic templates for each pulsar , and these were then cross - correlated with each observation s pulse profile in the fourier domain @xcite to obtain topocentric times of arrival ( toas ) .",
    "adding all the 1170 mhz observations irrespective of their signal - to - noise ratio ( snr , this varies from day to day because of diffractive interstellar scintillation ) , we obtain a `` global '' pulse profile which has a lower snr than the `` standard '' pulse profile .",
    "we calculated the average flux densities for both pulsars ( see table [ tab : parameters ] ) from the off - pulse r.m.s . in their global profile , assuming a system equivalent flux density of 3.5 jy which is valid for 1170   mhz at the high zenith angles required to observe m5 .",

    "the orbital parameters for m5b were modeled using the damour & deruelle orbital model @xcite . for most of the early 430-mhz toas",
    "we have no reliable uncertainty estimates .",
    "therefore , in order to achieve a reduced @xmath56 of 1 for both pulsars , we attributed a constant uncertainty to the 430-mhz toas that is similar to their unweighted rms .",
    "these times are listed in table [ tab : parameters ] . with these toas",
    ", we obtain timing parameters that are virtually identical to those obtained by the previous analysis ( anderson et al .",
    "for the new l - band data , we find the toa uncertainties to be under - estimated in the case of m5a .",
    "multiplying these by a factor of about 1.5 , we achieve a reduced @xmath56 of 1 for its l - band toas . in the case of m5b ,",

    "the post - fit timing residuals are essentially featureless at the present timing accuracy ( see fig . [",
    "fig : residuals ] ) .",
    "the large gap without measurements between the early 430-mhz data and later l - band data is in part due to the arecibo upgrade of the late 1990 s .",
    "we included an arbitrary time step between these two datasets in the fit .",
    "we have tested the timing solution by introducing extra pulsar rotations between the two datasets , but these are always absorbed by this arbitrary time step , with no other changes in the fitted timing parameters .",
    "the positions , periods and period derivatives that we have obtained are consistent with those of anderson et al ( 1997 ) . in what follows",
    ", we analyze solely the newly measured parameters : the proper motions and the rate of advance of periastron of m5b .",
    "in the reference frame of a gc , the rms of the velocities of its pulsars along the orthogonal axes perpendicular to the line of sight should be the same as the rms of their velocities along the line of sight .",
    "the stellar rms velocity along the line of sight at the center of m5 is 7.15  km  s@xmath25 @xcite ; the rms of the pulsar velocities should be smaller given the larger masses of the neutron stars ( nss ) .",
    "at the distance of m5 , 7.5  kpc @xcite , the stellar rms velocity represents a proper motion rms of only 0.2  mas  yr@xmath25 .",
    "given the present measurement precision , the estimated pulsar proper motions should be mutually consistent and reflect only the proper motion of the gc .",
    "the proper motion measurements in table  [ tab : parameters ] are indeed @xmath57 consistent with each other ; from their weighted average we derive a proper motion for m5 of @xmath58 mas yr@xmath25 and @xmath59 mas yr@xmath25 .",
    "m5 is one of the four gcs in the galaxy for which optical proper motion measurements have not provided consistent ( i.e. , agreeing within the formal uncertainty estimates ) results ( dinescu , girard & van altena 1999 ) .",
    "our m5 proper motion measurement is in marginal agreement with the values derived by scholz et al .",
    "[ 1996 , @xmath60 mas yr@xmath25 and @xmath61 mas yr@xmath25 ] , but is in good agreement with the values derived from hipparcos [ odenkirchen et al .",

    "we have used the astrometric information on m5b to search for an optical counterpart in archival _ hst _ acs / wfc data from programs go 10120 and go 10615 .",
    "the go-10120 images were taken on 2004 august 1 through the f435w , f625w and f658n filters .",
    "since the uncertainty in the absolute astrometry of _ hst _ data is 12 , we first tie the astrometry of the go-10120 acs images to the icrs frame using ucac2 stars ( positional accuracy @xmath650.070  down to the magnitude limit of the ucac2 catalog , * ? ? ?",
    ". since ucac2 standards in the small acs field ( 3.4@xmath663.4 ) are scarce , we use ground - based imaging of m5 to derive secondary standards .",
    "we retrieved from the public archive of the 2.5 m isaac newton telecope ( int ) a 30-s sloan - r wide field camera image taken on 2004 june 8 and processed only the chip that contained the core of m5 ( field of view @xmath6723@xmath6611 ) .",
    "astrometric calibration of this image was achieved using 308 ucac2 stars with positions corrected for proper motion to the epoch of the int image . after fitting for shift , rotation angle , scale factor and distortions",

    "( 1996 ) and assuming @xmath68 , the 14-gyr isochrones from bergbusch & vandenberg ( 1992 ) imply that `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' are @xmath670.75 and @xmath670.4@xmath69 stars , respectively ( for a distance modulus @xmath70 and @xmath71 , see sandquist et al 1996 ) . to check for fainter stars , we stacked f435w images taken with fraction - pixel offsets from _ hst _ program go 10615 ( 2006 feb 15 ) into a deep ( 8500 s ) high - resolution ( twice - oversampled ) masterframe .",
    "psf photometry revealed no additional stars within 3@xmath6 of m5b .",
    "a conservative upper limit for the detection limit is m@xmath72 mag which corresponds to @xmath670.250.3@xmath69 for ms stars in m5 ( although close to star `` 1 '' the sensitivity is lower ) .    in summary",
    ", we can not exclude stars `` 1 '' or `` 2 '' as counterparts of m5b .",
    "however , the astrometry suggests that it is more likely that the true optical counterpart is fainter than our detection limit .",
    "that implies that the companion is either a wd or a faint , low - mass ms star .",
    "we have determined a highly significant estimate for the rate of advance of periastron of m5b : @xmath73 .",
    "the 1-@xmath6 estimate provided directly by tempo is @xmath74 . to verify that these values are realistic , we have kept @xmath11 fixed , and fitted all the remaining timing parameters , recording the resulting @xmath56 .",
    "doing this for a range of values of @xmath11 , we obtain the 1-@xmath6 uncertainty as the half - width of the region where @xmath75 $ ] , @xmath76 being the value that minimizes @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath77 . estimating all parameters using a monte - carlo bootstrap algorithm (  [ sec : timing ] ) we obtain @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore , the lack of significant higher derivatives of the spin frequency ( see table  [ tab : parameters ] ) suggests that , with the present timing precision , we are unable to detect any of this pulsar s timing noise which can contaminate the physical interpretation of its timing uncertainties .",
    "this is a necessary pre - condition for an accurate estimation of parameter uncertainties .",
    "we therefore believe that the @xmath79 tempo uncertainty estimates are essentially accurate .",
    "we choose , however , to be more conservative by making our 1-@xmath6 uncertainties twice as large as the values suggested by the monte - carlo method ( see table  [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "this caution is due to our use of two different datasets with a large time gap between them .",
    "this time gap is common to many arecibo timing data sets , such as that of psr  j0751 + 1807 .",
    "nice et al .",
    "( 2005 ) claimed a mass of @xmath80 for that pulsar .",
    "this claim has recently been retracted , the latest estimate for the pulsar mass now being @xmath81 ( 1@xmath6 , nice 2007 ) .",
    "the problem with the earlier estimate was not related to the gap as the new estimate is based on essentially the same data .",
    "its cause was the use of a necessarily imperfect ephemeris when folding the very earliest data .",
    "this resulted in orbital - dependent smearing of the pulse profiles that led to an error in the calculation of the orbital phase for the earliest data and an over - estimate of the orbital period decay . because those data were folded online , this problem could only be solved by ignoring the earliest toas .",
    "our 430-mhz data contained the signals of more than one pulsar , so we had to record them to tape .",
    "this allowed us to re - fold them iteratively after the timing solution had been obtained ( anderson et al .",
    "1997 ) . after updating the timing solution to 2008",
    ", we have also re - folded all our l - band data ; none of the pulse profiles used in this work are therefore smeared due to imprecise folding .",
    "the possible contributions to @xmath11 in a system containing a pulsar and an extended star have been studied in detail by lai , bildsten & kaspi ( 1995 ) . in their analysis of the binary pulsar psr  j0045@xmath277319",
    "they concluded that the only likely contribution to @xmath11 in such systems is from rotational deformation of the companion .",
    "if we assume that psr  j0045@xmath277319 has a mass of @xmath82 , the companion mass is @xmath83 and its radius @xmath84 @xcite ; the orbital separation @xmath85 is @xmath86 . using these values they reached the conclusion that the contribution to @xmath11 from tidal deformations , which are proportional to @xmath87 , is not significant in that system .",
    "for m5b , again assuming a pulsar mass of @xmath82 with a ms companion of maximum mass @xmath88 ( see   [ sec : optical ] ) and a radius @xmath89 ( where @xmath90 ) , then the orbital inclination @xmath91 is @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "this is 30 times smaller than for psr  j0045@xmath277319 , becoming even less significant for smaller ms companion masses and correspondingly higher inclinations .    using equations 68 and 79 of wex ( 1998 ) we can estimate the contribution to @xmath11 due to rotational deformation : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the orbital angular frequency ( @xmath97 ) , @xmath98 is the gyration radius ( for a homogeneous sphere this is 0.63 , while for any centrally condensed objects this will always be smaller : it is about 0.2 for a completely convective star ) , @xmath99 is the rotation rate relative to break - up , @xmath100 is the angle between the rotational and orbital angular momenta ( if the companion is non - degenerate , these tend to be aligned , so @xmath101 ) and @xmath102 is the longitude of the ascending node in a reference frame defined by the total angular momentum vector ( see fig .  9 of wex 1998 ) .",

    "this would mean that @xmath117 could be @xmath118 times larger than discussed above , with @xmath110 similar to the observed @xmath11 .",
    "this is particularly so for the larger - sized wds ( those with the lowest masses ) .",
    "following splaver et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we note first that if the companion is not tidally locked , the angular momenta of the orbit and companion spin will probably not be aligned ( @xmath119 ) . in this case , the spin of the companion will induce a precession of the orbital plane .",
    "this will cause a change in @xmath91 , affecting the projected semi - major axis of the orbit which will vary with a rate @xmath42 . rewriting equation 81 of wex ( 1998 )",

    "in particular , the case of m28c demonstrated that if all nss start with @xmath170 , then some msps can be recycled by accreting @xmath171 from their companions . at the other end of the distribution ,",
    "ngc  6440b could be twice as massive",
    ".    it could be that msps were born with this wide range of masses .",
    "hydrodynamical core collapse simulations @xcite indicate that stars below @xmath172 form @xmath173 nss ( such as 47  tuc  h , m28c and ngc  1851a ) , while stars with masses between @xmath174 form @xmath175 nss ( similar to psr  j0437@xmath274715 , psr  j1903 + 0327 , terzan 5 i , j and m5b ) . above @xmath176 , stars experience partial fall - back of material immediately after the supernova that can significantly increase the mass of the stellar remnant , making it either a super - massive ns ( like ngc  6440b ) or a black hole .",
    "this possibility raises the question of why such massive nss , while representing about half of the msps in table  [ tab : msp_masses ] , have not been found among the 9 known dns systems .",
    "most of the secondary nss in dns systems have masses between 1.2 and @xmath177 , and recently van den heuvel ( 2007 ) suggested that these were formed by electron capture ( ec ) supernovae .",
    "the nine primary nss in dns systems were still likely formed in normal ( iron core collapse ) supernovae .",
    "the predicted percentage of massive nss is quite small , and with only 9 known dns we are unlikely to see any massive nss as the primary @xcite , a situation that is very different from what is derived for the msps .",
    "if the extra mass of some msps were instead acquired during the long accretion episodes that recycled them , we can explain naturally why we only see massive nss as msps ( not just in gcs , but also in the galaxy , e.g. verbiest et al .",
    "2008 , champion et al . 2008 )",
    "but not in dns systems .",
    "we have measured the positions and proper motions of m5a and b. this has allowed a detailed search for the companion of m5b .",

    "we have measured the rate of advance of periastron for this binary system , concluding that it is very likely due solely to the effects of general relativity . in this case , the total mass of the binary is @xmath179 , similar to the total masses of terzan  5  i and j. like those pulsars and ngc  6440b , the relatively low mass function for m5b indicates that most of the system mass is likely to be in the pulsar , which we estimate to be @xmath180 ( 1 @xmath6 ) .",
    "there is a 95% probability that the mass of this pulsar is above @xmath165 .",
    "if confirmed , this would exclude about a third of the equations of state that are now accepted as possible descriptions of the bulk properties of super - dense matter .",
    "together with other recent results , the large mass derived for m5b suggests that msps have a very broad mass distribution ; half of these objects seem to be significantly more massive than @xmath9 .",
