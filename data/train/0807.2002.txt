    "we shall restrict ourselves to condensates with repulsive interatomic interactions ( @xmath9 ) .    in highly anisotropic cigar - shaped traps",
    "the radial confinement can be so tight that the transversal motion becomes practically reduced to zero - point oscillations . under these circumstances ,",
    "only the slow axial degrees of freedom are relevant and the condensate dynamics becomes effectively one - dimensional .",
    "this is the quasi-1d mean - field regime .",
    "more generally , a high anisotropy always induces two very different time scales .",
    "when the axial motion is sufficiently slow in space and time that the radial degrees of freedom can adjust practically instantaneously to the different axial configurations , the radial motion becomes irrelevant and one can still study the condensate dynamics in terms of an effective equation of lower dimensionality .",
    "several proposals have been made in recent years in this respect @xcite .    by using the adiabatic approximation and the local chemical potential that follows from a suitable ansatz for the condensate local density @xcite , we derived in ref .",
    "@xcite an effective 1d equation of motion for the axial dynamics of cigar - shaped condensates with repulsive interatomic interactions .",
    "we demonstrated that this equation , which is also applicable to condensates containing an axisymmetric vortex of topological charge @xmath10 , is more accurate than previous proposals .",
    "it also has the advantage that it allows to obtain very accurate analytical expressions for a number of ground - state properties , and these expressions remain valid for condensates with an arbitrary number of particles . despite these merits , from a fundamental point of view",
    "it would be desirable to find a more systematic way of deriving this equation . in this work , by using a variational approach in combination with the adiabatic approximation we derive a new effective equation of motion which , for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , coincides exactly with our previous proposal .",
    "we also rederive the nonpolynomial schrdinger equation ( npse ) in terms of the adiabatic approximation .",
    "this provides a unified method for obtaining the different effective equations and allows appreciating clearly the differences and similarities between the various proposals .",
    "interestingly , it also demonstrates that in certain cases a variational approach based on the chemical - potential functional can produce more simple and accurate results than the usual variational approach based on the energy functional .",
    "we also obtain an expression for the _ axial healing length _ of cigar - shaped condensates and show that , in the local density approximation and in units of the axial oscillator length , it coincides with the inverse of the axial half - length . from this result",
    "it immediately follows the necessary condition for the validity of the local density approximation .",
    "finally , we obtain analytic formulas that give the frequency of the axial breathing mode of an elongated condensate with accuracy better than @xmath2 and remain valid in the crossover between the thomas - fermi ( tf ) and the quasi-1d mean - field regimes .",
    "in ref . @xcite we demonstrated that under usual conditions the axial dynamics of highly elongated mean - field condensates with repulsive interatomic interactions , confined in the radial direction by a harmonic potential and containing , in general , an axisymmetric vortex of charge @xmath10 , can be described by the effective 1d equation@xmath11 this equation incorporates properly the contribution from the transverse degrees of freedom through the term proportional to @xmath12 . the contribution from the vortex",
