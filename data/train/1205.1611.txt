    "a cylindrical obstacle moving in a classical viscous fluid generates a vortex - antivortex pair in its wake . at large reynolds numbers , such vortices develop into a periodic pattern known as the bnard - von krmn vortex ( bvk ) street .",
    "@xcite such dynamics are also found in superfluids for which vortex circulation is quantized and viscosity is absent .",
    "it was numerically demonstrated  @xcite that quantized vortex - antivortex pairs , which we call vortex dipoles , are shed in the wake of an obstacle moving in a planar superfluid above a critical velocity .",
    "this theoretical prediction has been realized in bose ",
    "einstein condensates ( becs ) of atomic gases , in which quantized vortex dipoles have been created using an moving obstacle potential produced by a laser beam .",
    "@xcite bvk vortex streets in superfluids ( i.e. , periodic and alternating creation of quantized vortices and antivortices that form a vortex street with a long lifetime ) have also been predicted for atomic becs ,  @xcite but they have yet to be demonstrated experimentally .    exciton - polariton superfluid flow past an obstacle has recently been demonstrated using a semiconductor microcavity .",
    "@xcite in these experiments , polaritons with a controlled in - plane momentum are coherently injected into a sample by a pumping laser , and an obstacle potential is produced by a defect in the microcavity ,  @xcite by a continuous - wave ( cw ) laser field ,  @xcite or by etching the sample .",

    "@xcite for subsonic flow , quantized vortex dipoles are produced in the wake .",
    "@xcite these phenomena have been studied theoretically by several researchers .",
    "@xcite    a polariton condensate differs from superfluid helium and an atomic gas bec in that it is a nonequilibrium open system .",
    "the polaritons have a short lifetime of @xmath0 10 ps , which is comparable to the time scale of the relevant dynamics . in the experiments described in refs .",
    ", polaritons are constantly replenished by pumping with a cw laser and the system reaches a nonequilibrium steady state , in which the pumping balances the loss .",
    "another difference from atomic systems is that the polariton is a coherent superposition of a quantum - well exciton and a cavity photon and the interparticle interaction originates only from the former ; in other words , a polariton superfluid is a nontrivial two - component system .",
    "because of these differences , it is by no means obvious that a polariton superfluid shares the same dynamic phenomena as superfluid helium and atomic gas bec .    in this paper , we investigate the dynamics of an exciton - polariton superfluid passing an obstacle potential and show that a superfluid bvk vortex street  @xcite emerges in this system , as well as vortex dipoles and dark solitons .",
