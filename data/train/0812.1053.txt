    "calculation of the cross section of central exclusive diffraction , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 = dijet , heavy quarkonium , higgs boson , _",
    "etc_. ) presents a major challenge for strong interaction physics .",
    "it involves treating the hard dynamics in the elementary @xmath2 subprocess , and calculating the probability that no other interactions leading to hadron production occur during the @xmath1 collision .",
    "the latter determines the suppression of diffractive relative to non - diffractive events with the same hard process , referred to as the rapidity gap survival ( rgs ) probability . in this article",
    "we summarize our understanding of the dynamical mechanisms determining the rgs probability , their phenomenological description , and the uncertainties in present numerical predictions .",
    "rgs in central exclusive diffraction has extensively been discussed in an approach where soft interactions are modeled by eikonalized pomeron exchange ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a summary .",
    "more recently a partonic description was proposed , which allows for a model  independent formulation of the interplay of hard and soft interactions and reveals the essential role of the `` transverse geometry '' of the @xmath1 collision @xcite . in the mean  field approximation , where hard and soft interactions are considered as independent aside from their common dependence on the impact parameter",
    ", we derived a simple `` factorized '' expression for the rgs probability , using closure of the partonic states to take into account inelastic diffractive intermediate states .",
    "the resulting rgs probability is smaller than in the models of refs .",
    "@xcite without inelastic diffraction , but comparable to the some of the versions of those models with multichannel diffraction .",
    "our partonic description also permits us to go beyond the mean  field approximation and incorporate various types of correlations between the hard scattering process and spectator interactions .",
    "here we discuss two such effects : ( a ) quantum fluctuations of the partonic configurations of the colliding protons , which somewhat reduce the survival probabilities at rhic and tevatron energies ; ( b ) absorptive interactions of high - virtuality spectator partons ( @xmath6 ) associated with the hard scattering process , related to the onset of the black  disk regime ( bdr ) in hard interactions at lhc energies ; this new effect substantially reduces the rgs probability compared to previously published estimates .",
    "a simple picture of rgs is obtained in the impact parameter representation .",
    "on one hand , to produce the heavy system @xmath5 two hard gluons from each of the two protons need to collide in the same space  time point ( actually , an area of transverse size @xmath7 in the hard process ) ; because such gluons are concentrated around the transverse centers of the protons this is most likely when the protons collide at a small impact parameters , @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "soft inelastic spectator interactions are strongest at small @xmath9 and would favor collisions at @xmath10 for diffractive scattering .",
    "these different preferences limit diffraction to an intermediate range of impact parameters and ensure that its cross section is substantially suppressed compared to non  diffractive scattering .",
    "more precisely , the rgs probability is given by @xcite @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the probability for two gluons to collide at the same transverse point as a function of the @xmath1 impact parameter , given by the convolution of the transverse spatial distributions of the gluons in the colliding protons , normalized to @xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rgs]a ) .",
    "the factor @xmath14 is the probability for the two protons not to interact inelastically in a collision at the given impact parameter , calculable in terms of the profile function of the @xmath1 elastic amplitude , @xmath15 .",

    "we first consider the transverse spatial distribution of gluons entering in @xmath22 .",
    "the latter is obtained as the fourier transform of the @xmath23dependence ( more precisely , transverse momentum dependence ) of the gluon generalized parton distribution ( gpd ) measured in hard exclusive vector meson production .",
    "extensive studies at hera have shown that exclusive @xmath24 photoproduction , @xmath25 , provides an effective means for probing the @xmath23dependence of the gluon gpd at small and intermediate @xmath16 ( a small correction for the finite transverse size of the @xmath24 is applied ) @xcite .",

    "we find a 15 - 20% uncertainty of @xmath26 at @xmath33 in this way , translating into a 2030% uncertainty in the mean  field rgs probability , eq .",

    "dedicated analysis of the remaining hera exclusive data , and particularly precision measurements with a future electron  ion collider ( eic ) , could substantially improve our knowledge of the transverse spatial distribution of gluons .",
    "we now turn to the uncertainty in @xmath21 arising from the @xmath1 elastic amplitude , @xmath35 .",
    "most phenomenological analyses of @xmath1 elastic and total cross section data find that for tev energies @xmath36 at @xmath37 , corresponding to near  unit probability of inelastic interactions at small impact parameters ( bdr ) .",
    "this is supported by theoretical studies in the qcd dipole model , which show that the large@xmath16 partons with virtualities of up to several @xmath38 experience `` black '' interactions with the small@xmath16 gluon field in the other proton when passing through the other proton at transverse distances @xmath39 , and receive transverse momenta @xmath40 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a summary ) . at @xmath1 impact parameter @xmath37",
    "the chance that none of the leading partons in the protons receive such a kick is extremely small , implying that @xmath41 @xcite . for the rgs probability in the mean  field approximation , eq .",
    "( [ survb ] ) , the fact that @xmath42 is small at @xmath37 is essential , as this eliminates the contribution from small @xmath9 in the integral ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rgs]b ) and stabilizes the numerical predictions",

    "we find that a value of @xmath46 , corresponding to @xmath47 , increases the mean  field result for @xmath21 by a factor @xmath48 , indicating significant uncertainty of the mean  field result .",
    "however , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : bdr_hard ] below , hard spectator interactions associated with the @xmath2 process lead to an additional suppression of diffraction at small @xmath9 ( not contained in the soft rgs probability ) , which mitigates the impact of this uncertainty on the overall diffractive cross section .",
    "corrections to the mean  field picture of rgs arise from fluctuations of the interacting configurations in the colliding protons .",
    "this concept is known well in soft diffraction , where fluctuations of the strength of interaction between the colliding hadrons give rise to inelastic diffraction . in hard diffraction ,",
    "one expects that also the gluon density fluctuates ; _",
    "e.g. _  because the color fields are screened in configurations of small size @xcite .",
    "in fact , the variance of the gluon density fluctuations can be directly related to the ratio of inelastic and elastic diffraction in processes such as @xmath49 , @xmath50 the hera data are consistent with the dynamical model estimate of @xmath51 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xcite ; unfortunately , the limited @xmath54 range and the lack of dedicated studies do not allow for a more precise extraction of this fundamental quantity .    in central exclusive diffraction , correlated fluctuations of the soft  interaction strength and the gluon density lower the rgs probability , because small - size configurations which experience little absorption have a lower gluon density .",
    "this effect can be modeled by a generalization of the mean  field expression ( [ survb ] ) , in which both the gluon gpds in @xmath55 and the profile function fluctuate as a function of an external parameter controlling the overall size of the configurations @xcite .",
    "numerical studies find a reduction of the rgs probability by a factor @xmath56 for a system with mass @xmath57 produced at zero rapidity at @xmath58 . the dynamical model used in this estimate does not include fluctuations of the gluon density at larger @xmath59 , which could increase the suppression .",
    "we emphasize again that inelastic diffraction _",
    "per se _ is included in the partonic approach of ref .",
    "@xcite through the closure of partonic states .",
    "the effect discussed in this section is specifically related to correlations between the fluctuations of the parton densities and the soft  interaction strength ; in the limit of zero correlations ( independent fluctuations ) we recover the mean  field result described above @xcite .",
    "substantial changes in the mechanism of diffractive scattering are brought about by the onset of the bdr in hard interactions at lhc energies , where even highly virtual partons ( @xmath60 ) with @xmath61 experience `` black '' interactions with the small@xmath16 gluons in the other proton .",
    "this new effect modifies the amplitude of central exclusive diffraction in several ways : ( a ) absorption of the `` parent '' partons of the gluons attached to the high  mass system ; ( b ) absorption of the hard gluons attached to the high  mass system ; ( c ) absorption due to local interactions within the partonic ladder .",
    "such absorptive hard interactions cause additional suppression of diffractive scattering , not included in the traditional soft  interaction rgs probability @xcite .",
    "because of the generic nature of `` black '' interactions , we can estimate this effect by a certain modification of the mean  field picture in the impact parameter representation . here",
    "we focus on mechanism ( a ) and show that it causes substantial suppression ; the other mechanisms may result in further suppression .    .",
    "( b ) absorptive interaction of the hard spectator with small@xmath16 gluons in the other proton.,scaledwidth=98.0% ]    according to ref .",
    "@xcite ( and references therein ) the dominant contribution to the hard amplitude of higgs production at the lhc ( @xmath62 ) originates from gluons with transverse momenta of the order @xmath63 .",
    "such gluons are typically generated by dglap evolution starting from the initial scale , @xmath64 , in which spectator partons , mostly gluons , are emitted ( see fig.[hardabs]a ) . in the leading  log approximation @xmath65 , and",
    "thus the transverse distance between the active and spectator parton is @xmath66 , amounting to short  range correlations between partons . if the interactions of the spectator parton with the small@xmath16 gluons in the other proton become significant ( see fig.[hardabs]b ) , the basic assumption of the mean  field approximation",
    " that the spectator interactions are independent of the hard process  is violated , and the interactions of that parton need to be treated separately . indeed , studies within the qcd dipole model show that at the lhc energy spectator gluons with @xmath67 and @xmath68 `` see '' gluons with momentum fractions @xmath69 in the other proton , and are absorbed with near  unit probability if their impact parameters with the other proton are less than @xmath70 @xcite . ) dipoles is larger than that of the quark  antiquark ( @xmath71 ) dipoles in @xmath72 scattering @xcite by a factor @xmath73 . a summary plot of the profile function for gluon  proton scattering is given in fig .",

    "proton impact parameters @xmath79 ( _ cf_.  fig .",
    "[ fig : rgs]a ) , so that this effect practically eliminates diffraction at @xmath77 . since @xmath77 accounts for 2/3 of the cross section ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rgs]b ) , and the remaining contributions at @xmath80 are also reduced by absorption , we estimate that absorptive interactions of hard spectators in the bdr reduce the rgs probability at lhc to about 20% of its mean  field value .",
    "much less suppression is expected at the tevatron energy , where hard spectator interactions only marginally reach the bdr .    in the above argument",
    "one must also allow for the possibility of trajectories with no gluon emission , which correspond to the sudakov form factor ",
    "suppressed @xmath81term in the evolution kernel . while such trajectories are not affected by absorption ,",
    "their contributions are small both because of the sudakov suppression , and because they effectively probe the gluon density at a low scale , @xmath82 , where evolution  induced correlations between partons can be neglected .",
    "we estimate that the contribution of such trajectories to the cross section is suppressed compared to those with emissions by a factor @xmath83 ^ 2 \\sim 1/10 $ ] , where @xmath84 $ ] is the square of the sudakov form factor , and @xmath85 .",
    "their net contribution is thus comparable to that of the trajectories with emissions , because the latter are strongly suppressed by the absorption effect described above . combining the two",
    ", we obtain an overall suppression by a factor of the order @xmath86 .",
    "more accurate estimates would need to take into account fluctuations in the number of emissions ; in particular , trajectories on which only one of the partons did not emit gluons are suppressed only by @xmath87 and may make significant contributions .",
    "the absorptive hard spectator interactions described here `` push '' diffractive @xmath1 scattering to even larger impact parameters than would be allowed by the soft spectator interactions included in the mean  field rgs probability , eq .",
    "( [ survb ] ) ( except for the sudakov  suppressed contribution ) .",
    "one interesting consequence of this is that it makes the uncertainty in the mean  field prediction arising from @xmath88 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : mean ] ) largely irrelevant , as the region of small impact parameters is now practically eliminated by the hard spectator interactions .",
    "another consequence is that the final  state proton transverse momentum distribution is shifted to to smaller values ; this could in principle be observed in @xmath89dependent measurements of diffraction .",
    "we note that the estimates of hard spectator interactions reported here are based on the assumption that dglap evolution reasonably well describes the gluon density down to @xmath90 ; the details ( but not the basic picture ) may change if small@xmath16 resummation corrections were to significantly modify the gluon density at such values of @xmath16 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the approach to the bdr in the interaction of hard spectator partons , caused by the increase of the gluon density at small @xmath16 , has profound implications for central exclusive diffraction at lhc : _ no saturation without disintegration ! _",
    "the rgs probability is likely to be much smaller ( by a factor of @xmath91 or less ) than predicted by the mean  field approximation or corresponding models which neglect correlations of partons in the transverse plane .",
    "diffractive scattering is relegated either to very large impact parameters ( @xmath92 ) or to sudakov  suppressed trajectories without gluon radiation .",
    "we estimate that the overall rgs probability at lhc is @xmath93 .",
    "extrapolation of the tevatron results may be misleading because interactions of hard spectators are generally far from `` black '' at that energy .",
    "the new effects described here call for detailed mc  based studies of possible histories of the hard scattering process and their associated spectator interactions ."
