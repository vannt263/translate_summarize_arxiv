    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) charge radius of the proton @xmath0 has been extracted to unprecedented precision from recent measurements of the lamb shift ( 2s-2p ) transition in muonic hydrogen @xmath1h .",
    "the extracted @xmath0 value is smaller by 7@xmath2 with respect to the codata value , which is based on @xmath3h spectroscopy and @xmath3-@xmath4 scattering @xcite .",
    "this unresolved discrepancy between the electron - based and the muon - based values is known as  the proton radius puzzle \" , and challenges our understanding of physics based on the standard model . the crema collaboration at psi has undertaken the task of extracting the nuclear rms charge radius @xmath5 from measurements of the lamb shift in several hydrogen - like muonic systems , with the aim to improve the accuracy in the determination of @xmath5 .",
    "these new measurements may shed light on the puzzle by studying whether the discrepancy between the nuclear charge radii measured using electrons and muons persists or varies as a function of the atomic mass @xmath6 and charge number @xmath7 .",
    "for @xmath8 these measurements are affected by nuclear structure corrections .",
    "ultimately , these corrections determine the attainable precision of @xmath5 , and it is therefore important to obtain the most accurate nuclear structure corrections with reliable uncertainties . +        the lamb shift is related to @xmath5 by @xmath9 the three terms , given in order of decreasing magnitude , are : the qed contributions from vacuum polarization , lepton self energy , and relativistic recoil ; the leading correction due to the finite size of the nucleus , @xmath10 ( in @xmath11 units ) , from one - photon - exchange ; and the two - photon exchange ( tpe ) contribution depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the contributions from this diagram are divided into the elastic zemach term and the inelastic polarization term , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath12 , which can be further separated into nuclear @xmath13 and nucleonic @xmath14 components , _",
    "i.e _ , @xmath15 . in refs .",
    "@xcite we have provided values for the various terms in @xmath16 for the hydrogen - like muonic systems with @xmath17 , based on _ ab initio _ calculations with various state - of - the - art models for the nuclear hamiltonian and newly developed methods @xcite .",
    "this has enabled us to provide improved precision and uncertainty estimates compared to previous results .",
    "here we provide details on recent recalculations of @xmath18 and the corrections to @xmath19 due to the finite size of the nucleons .",
    "the calculation of @xmath19 is portrayed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the various terms contributing to @xmath19 are obtained in a multipole expansion formalism @xmath20 the terms @xmath21 denote the leading , sub - leading , and 2nd - order corrections , respectively , all calculated in the point - nucleon limit .",
    "the terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the respective nucleon size ( ns ) corrections .",
    "the details of the calculation and formula for each of these terms are illustrated in ref .",
    "some of the terms that contribute to the ns corrections have been updated in ref .",
    "@xcite ; below we provide more details as well as further updates .",
    "when the finite sizes of the nucleons are considered , the coulomb interaction with the point - protons is substituted by an integration over the internal charge distributions of the nucleons . in refs .",
    "@xcite the ns corrections were derived in momentum - space , using the low @xmath24 approximation for the nucleon form factors .",
    "they were re - derived in ref .",
    "@xcite in coordinate - space , as was done by friar in ref .",
    "the results of this treatment are identical to those of refs .",
    "@xcite , with the exception of a term that vanishes in the momentum - space treatment used there .",
    "this term is related to the 3rd zemach moments of the nucleons .",
    "the contribution from the neutrons is negligible , and the contribution from the protons is estimated from the corresponding term in muonic hydrogen @xmath25 according to @xmath26 the scaling factor in the above equation can be extracted from ref .",
    ". however , it differs from the one used , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite for both the elastic and inelastic nucleon tpe , and calls for further investigation .    next we detail the 2nd order ns corrections @xmath27 .",
    "the neutron - neutron contribution is negligible , therefore only proton - proton @xmath28 and neutron - proton @xmath29 terms contribute .",
    "the former is expressed , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , by @xmath30 using the dipole response @xmath31 where @xmath32 , with @xmath33 the rank-1 spherical harmonic .",
    "the latter , however , takes the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 contains the protonic dipole operator @xmath36 and the neutronic dipole operator @xmath37 .",
    "the isoscalar part of both operators is proportional to the nuclear center of mass motion , and vanishes between the nuclear ground and excited states .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath38 , which was used in the last step of eq .  .",
    "the expression in eq .   supersedes the corresponding ones in @xcite .",
    "the results in eqs .   and coincide with the corresponding expression for the special case of deuterium given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and were used in a recent summary of the theory related to the @xmath1d experiment @xcite .",
    "integrating the new @xmath18 and @xmath27 discussed above into the results of refs .",
    "@xcite we obtain updated values for @xmath1d , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] below we present updated results for the individual terms in @xmath16 for all @xmath17 hydrogen - like muonic systems , where the results for @xmath42 are taken from refs .",
    "@xcite , and for @xmath43 the results given here are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and supersede it due to eq .   and a correct implementation of eq .  .",
    "more details will be given in ref .",
    "@xcite . for completeness",
    "we include @xmath44 in table [ tab:1 ] , where for @xmath1d its value and uncertainty were extracted from data in ref .",
