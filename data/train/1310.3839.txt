    "in regge phenomenology , high mass single diffraction implies a non - zero triple - pomeron coupling , which in turn implies , through the optical theorem , double pomeron exchange , d@xmath8e , : @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 means a proton or antiproton , the final state protons may be quasi - elastic or they may dissociate ( @xmath11 ) , and @xmath12 represents a large rapidity gap @xmath13 with no hadrons .",
    "see ref.@xcite for a review . by ",
    "exclusive \" we mean that the central state @xmath14 is simple and fully measured . at low masses , in the resonance region @xmath15 3 gev , d@xmath8e is non - perturbative and qcd ( or qcd - inspired ) calculations are challenging ; there are new efforts by the durham  @xcite and cracow  @xcite groups .",
    "the quantum numbers of @xmath14 are restricted to be mostly @xmath16 , so @xmath6-channel resonances @xmath17 and @xmath18 are allowed .",
    "resonances with a high gluon content will be favored , especially in comparison with @xmath19 . for the @xmath20 and @xmath21 states perturbative calculations of @xmath22 are applicable , related to the very interesting channels @xmath23  @xcite and @xmath24 higgs .",
    "so we have several motivations : improving our understanding of the pomeron , meson ( especially glueball ) spectroscopy , and testing the qcd physics of exclusive production ( especially @xmath25 and higgs ) .",
    "the cdf detector at the fermilab tevatron is well - known .",
    "for this study we used data not only at the usual @xmath1 = 1960 gev , but also at 900 gev in a special run .",
    "we only used bunch crossings with a single interaction , i.e. no pile - up , and we required all the cdf detectors , covering @xmath26 to be empty , except for two oppositely - charged tracks and their corresponding calorimeter hits .",
    "the trigger for these events was @xmath27 calorimeter showers with @xmath28 0.5 gev , with a veto on beam shower counter hits ( @xmath29 ) , cherenkov luminosity counters ( @xmath30 = 3.7 - 4.7 ) and forward calorimeters ( @xmath30 = 1.32 - 3.64 ) .",
    "we had 22 m ( 90 m ) triggers at @xmath1 = 900 ( 1960 ) gev .",
    "off - line we required the central calorimeters ( @xmath31 1.3 ) to be also empty , apart from the trigger clusters .",
    "importantly , we simultaneously recorded a large sample of 0-bias ( bunch crossing ) triggers . dividing these into  interaction \" and  non - interaction \" samples , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , allowed us to determine the noise levels in all the detectors , and to measure the total visible cross section @xmath32 , which is the inelastic cross section @xmath33 times the fraction @xmath34 of inelastic events with particles in @xmath35 5.9 , estimated to be 0.90@xmath360.05 ( 0.85@xmath360.05 ) . at 1960",
    "gev @xmath32 agreed with global fits ; at 900 gev we used @xmath32 to normalize our cross sections , as the luminosity counters were not calibrated .",
    "the total delivered luminosity at the two energies was 0.056 ( 7.12 ) pb@xmath37 .",
    "the effective  no - pile - up \" luminosity was 0.0435 ( 1.18 ) pb@xmath37 , determined by counting empty 0-bias events as a function of the bunch luminosity .",
    "off - line we required exactly two well - measured opposite - charge tracks with @xmath38 and @xmath39 0.4 gev / c .",
    "the pair @xmath40 ( @xmath41-masses assumed ) was required to have @xmath42 1.0 , and @xmath43 0.8 gev to have acceptance down to @xmath44 .",
    "we calculated the acceptance and efficiencies for the above fiducial region , and with the effective luminosity calculated the differential cross section @xmath45 , assuming an isotropic ( s - wave ) @xmath46 distribution .",
    "for two particles , assumed to be @xmath0 , in the stated kinematic region , between two rapidity gaps @xmath474.6 , at @xmath1 = 1960 gev.,width=472 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_corr_1960 ] shows the differential cross section integrated over @xmath48 as a function of @xmath49 , and fig .",
    "2a shows the low mass region on a linear scale , and at both energies .",
    "a small @xmath4 signal is seen , and a dominant @xmath5 ( also dominant in @xmath50 ) . a possible shoulder on the high mass side ( @xmath51 ? )",
    "is followed by a distinct change of slope at 1500 mev , which was also seen at lower energies  @xcite . while the cross section shapes are similar at the two energies , they differ in detail as seen in the ratio plot fig .",
    "in addition to any @xmath6-dependence of the @xmath52 cross section ( expected from regge to be @xmath53ln@xmath54 ) there is more rapidity available for proton dissociation at 1960 gev , the beam rapidities being 6.87 and 7.64 while the detector extends to @xmath55 = 5.9 in both cases .",
    "we observe that the ratio is lower in the region of the @xmath5 than it is below 1 gev , expected to be dominated by s - wave .",
    "we also find that the mean @xmath56 has a minimum in the @xmath5 region , and rises abruptly at 1.5 gev .",
    "we previously observed  @xcite exclusive @xmath57 production in the mode @xmath58 , but could not distinguish the three @xmath20 states .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath59 channels have larger branching fractions and enough resolution to separate the @xmath60 states .",
    "we do not see significant signals in this data , and give upper limits ( 90% c.l . ) on @xmath61 = 21.4@xmath364.2(syst.)nb ( in @xmath0 ) and 18.9@xmath363.8(syst.)nb ( in @xmath59 ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath62% of the @xmath63 events were @xmath64 .",
    "even though the @xmath18 may have a much smaller production cross section its branching fraction is 17@xmath65 larger .",
    "we studied the cos @xmath66 distributions of the @xmath67 in the @xmath14-frame relative to the incoming @xmath10-direction .",
    "the data are consistent with isotropy up to 1.5 gev , above which they become progressively more forward - backward peaked .",
    "isotropy is expected if any polarization at production is washed out after integration over the unseen protons or @xmath68-dissociations .",
    "the  durham \" and  cracow \" groups  @xcite have predicted the differential cross section with the same cuts as fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_corr_1960 ] , but with no dissociation .",
    "theoretical uncertainties in the region @xmath69 gev are about @xmath70 , but the data are within these uncertainties .",
