    "the study of many - body quantum systems that undergo _ purely dissipative _ dynamics but at the same time feature quantum coherences and superpositions is an emerging theme that has attracted much interest in the past few years @xcite .",
    "the catalyst was the realization that an appropriately engineered dissipative dynamics with non - classical jump operators represents a route towards the preparation of specific many - body states and non - equilibrium quantum phases with potential to be a resource for quantum computation @xcite .    in this paper , we aim to study the role that quantum coherences and superpositions play in the relaxation of these dissipative many - body quantum systems .",
    "in particular , we will study systems with purely dissipative and markovian dynamics generated by a lindblad master equation formed by non - classical jump operators whose action can bring the system into quantum superpositions .",
    "the stationary state of these systems will be given by a pure state annihilated by all jump operators , an absorbing or `` dark '' state which in general will display quantum coherences .",
    "moreover , these systems will be constructed such that in the stationary state the diagonal of the density matrix coincides with the equilibrium probability distribution of a completely classical rate equation .",
    "our aim will be to contrast the relaxation given by this dissipative , yet quantum , dynamics with the one obtained via classical rate equations .    in order to tackle this task we will focus on a class of quantum spin systems inspired by kinetically constrained models of glasses ( kcms ) @xcite .",
    "these are classical stochastic models with trivial static equilibrium properties but complex collective dynamics due to the imposed kinetic constraints . here",
    "we construct the purely dissipative quantum counterparts of these systems by ensuring that the values of diagonal observables ( e.g. the density of excitations or the density - density correlations ) in the stationary state coincide with the classical ones .",
    "in classical kcms all the complexity is found in the dynamics and not in their stationary state @xcite .",
    "the quantum dissipative kcms we consider share this property , and are therefore a good test bed to study the differences and similarities in the relaxation between classical and purely dissipative quantum dynamics .",
    "a significant finding is that even when the relaxation timescales of the diagonal observables are similar , the coherences in the quantum system can take orders of magnitude longer to relax .",
    "the models we construct can be regarded as an instance of quantum glasses , that is , interacting quantum systems whose real time relaxation is due to fluctuations of both thermal and quantum origin @xcite .",
    "quantum glassiness is a timely topic also due to its relevance to thermalisation in quantum systems @xcite and to many - body localization @xcite .",
    "finally , we show that aspects of these quantum kcms , and therefore aspects of quantum glassiness more generally , become manifest in an ensemble of excited ( rydberg ) atoms @xcite under electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) conditions .",
    "our intention for drawing this connection is two - fold : firstly , it demonstrates that the rather idealized features of quantum kcms such as kinetic constraints and a purely dissipative , yet quantum , dynamics are actually present in a system currently studied by many experimental groups @xcite .",
    "secondly , this discussion sheds light on the limitations of the description of the dynamics of the eit rydberg gas in terms of classical rate equations , currently employed by numerous authors @xcite .",
    "consider a classical stochastic system described by the master equation @xmath0 where the vector @xmath1 represents the probability distribution at time @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is an orthonormal configuration basis . for a continuous time markov chain the classical master operator reads , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the transition rate from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , and @xmath8 the escape rate from the configuration @xmath6 .",
    "let us assume that the dynamics obeys _ detailed balance _ with respect to the equilibrium probability @xmath9 , i.e. , the transition rates satisfy , @xmath10 .",
    "this condition allows to transform the stochastic operator @xmath11 into a hermitian one @xmath12 through a similarity transformation , @xmath13 note that the ground state @xmath14 of @xmath12 ( with eigenvalue 0 ) is directly related to the equilibrium probability as @xmath15 .",
    "our aim is now to define a quantum model undergoing _ purely dissipative quantum dynamics _ generated by a quantum master equation of the lindblad form @xcite , @xmath16 such that the dynamics converges to a stationary state @xmath17 where the expectation value of any classical operator @xmath18 ( diagonal in the classical basis of configurations ) is the same as in the classical equilibrium distribution @xmath19 = \\sum_{{\\mathcal{c } } } p_{\\rm eq}({\\mathcal{c } } ) o({\\mathcal{c } } ) .",
    "\\label{eq : o}\\ ] ] this can be achieved by defining the following operators associated to the classical transitions between any pair of configurations @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 can in principle be any normalized state .",
    "one can show that the hermitian form of the master operator can be written as @xmath23 moreover , @xmath24 for all @xmath25 , that is , the state @xmath14 is a _ dark state _ for all operators @xmath26 .",
    "thus , by considering the operators @xmath26 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : j ] ) as quantum jump operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : me ] ) the quantum dynamics converges to a pure stationary state @xmath27 , where indeed the expectation values of classical operators correspond to the classical equilibrium ones as required in ( [ eq : o ] ) .",
    "the key question is what difference , if any , there is between the quantum dynamics defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : me ] ) and ( [ eq : j ] ) and the classical one generated by ( [ eq : mec ] ) and ( [ eq : w ] ) .",
    "to gain a general understanding of this question we consider a particular set of quantum spin models based on classical kcms @xcite .",
    "the models we consider are defined in terms of @xmath28 binary variables on the sites of a lattice such that @xmath29 or @xmath30 corresponds to the @xmath31-th spin in the down or up state , respectively .",
    "the classical models can also be written in terms of a master equation like ( [ eq : me ] ) but with a pair of jump operators for each site @xmath32 that act on a diagonal density matrix and connect a classical configuration with another one that differs by the flip of the @xmath31-th spin , @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is the bare rate of jumps , @xmath35 $ ] is the average site occupation in equilibrium and @xmath36 are the spin-@xmath37 ladder operators .",
    "the operator @xmath38 represents a _",
    "kinetic constraint _ on site @xmath31 , that is , a function of diagonal operators @xmath39 @xmath40 , which conditions the dynamics of site @xmath31 depending on the state of its neighbours .",
    "in contrast , in the quantum model there is a _ single jump operator per site _ , which establishes superpositions between @xmath41 and @xmath42 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 it is important to note that the construction of the quantum problem allows more freedom than the classical case : the relaxation is not only controlled by the constraint function @xmath45 , but also by an additional arbitrary set of unitaries @xmath46 ( discussed in detail later ) .",
    "however , similarly to the classical case , the stationary state of the dynamics generated by ( [ eq : me ] ) is , independently of the choices for @xmath46 and @xmath45 , the same pure state of the direct product form @xmath47 where @xmath48 so that @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , the quantum problem is constructed such that the expectation values of all diagonal operators in the @xmath50 basis ( such as the density of excitations or the density - density correlations ) in the stationary state @xmath51 _ coincide _ with those at equilibrium in the classical one .    as a first elementary comparison we can consider an unconstrained single spin ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "its classical dynamics is determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : me ] ) with the two jump operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in this case , the relaxation of the density of excitations @xmath55 is exponential with a single timescale given by @xmath56 .",
    "the quantum model has a single jump operator of the form ( [ eq : jj ] ) , @xmath57 . for the purpose of illustration",
    "we choose the free unitary @xmath58 to be a spin rotation around the @xmath59-axis , i.e. , @xmath60 with the angle @xmath61 .",
    "the solution of the master equation reveals now two relaxation timescales for the density of excitations , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the emergence of the second @xmath64-dependent timescale , which is due to @xmath58 and hence absent in the classical case , can be understood by unravelling the dynamics in terms of quantum jump trajectories with respect to the jump operators @xmath65 @xcite . here , each trajectory is obtained by a `` no - jump '' non - hermitian time - evolution of the system via @xmath66 interspersed with quantum jumps .",
    "while the evolution between jumps is @xmath58-independent and thus @xmath64-independent , each quantum jump may take the system closer or further away from the stationary state @xmath67 depending on the angle @xmath64 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath68 the time @xmath69 coincides with @xmath70 . the limit of @xmath71 is the opposite extreme . here",
    ", the jump operators are hermitian and the completely mixed state ( proportional to the identity ) becomes a further stationary state together with the pure one .",
    "the system then relaxes into a combination of the pure state and the completely mixed state that depends on the initial conditions .     and a system size of @xmath72 spins ( time in units of @xmath73 ) .",

    "inset : time - evolution of @xmath75 for @xmath32 in a single trajectory for @xmath68 . ]",
    "we now turn to the actual constrained many - body models .",
    "we will consider here two models determined by the kinetic constraints : @xmath76 , which allows transitions at site @xmath31 only if site @xmath77 has a projection on the spin state @xmath78 ( in analogy with the classical east model @xcite ) , and @xmath79 , which allows transitions at site @xmath31 if and only if at least one of the sites at @xmath80 has a projection on @xmath78 ( in analogy with the classical fredrickson - andersen ( fa ) model @xcite ) .",
    "we first focus on the east model .",
    "when @xmath81 is small the system s relaxation encounters a conflict between the probability cost of flipping spins up , and the need for excited sites to facilitate neighbouring ones through the constraint @xmath82 . in the classical model",
    "this gives rise to hierarchical dynamics @xcite , which manifests for example in metastable plateaus in the relaxation of the density , see fig . [",
    "fig : east ] . for the quantum counterpart , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : me],[eq : jj ] ) , the dynamics depends on the angle @xmath64 that defines the unitaries @xmath83 , which for simplicity we consider again to be local spin rotations .",
    "we use quantum jump monte carlo simulations to study the time evolution of the system numerically starting from a state of maximum density , see fig . [",
    "fig : east ] .",
    "one can distinguish several regimes in the quantum relaxation of the average density of excited sites .",
    "for short times one has effectively unconstrained dynamics , as the density of excitations is high and thus the constraints still do not play a role . when @xmath68 , both the  no jump \" dynamics due to @xmath84 and the action of the non - classical jump operators help the system to reach a configuration where the excitations are isolated ( see inset to fig .  [",
    "fig : east ] ) .",
    "further relaxation needs excitations to effectively propagate , to meet and coalesce with others .",
    "this slow propagation leads to the different plateaus , in analogy with the classical east model @xcite .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath85 every jump brings the system away from the stationary state , making another jump likely to occur . this different behavior between @xmath86 and @xmath85",
    "becomes clear in the distributions of waiting times between jumps , see fig .",
    "[ fig : times ] .     as a function of time in the dissipative quantum east model for @xmath72 and @xmath87",
    "( all times in units of @xmath73 ) .",
    "( a ) when @xmath68 , the plateaus in the excitation density give rise to the appearance of several peaks in the waiting time distributions .",
    "( b ) when @xmath88 , every jump brings the system away from equilibrium making the occurrence of a subsequent jump more likely . ]",
    "the key aspect in the dynamics of the quantum version of the east model is in the relaxation of the coherences , represented in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : east ] by @xmath89 . for any angle @xmath64 this",
    "observable takes approximately three orders of magnitude longer to relax than the density of excitations .",
    "the reason for this mismatch between the two timescales can be understood by looking into single trajectories ( e.g. inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : east ] ) . here , we observe that the strongly constrained propagation - coalescence relaxation of the density leaves the system eventually in a very inhomogeneous configuration with an isolated excitation , where the density profile is roughly @xmath90 . while the overall value of the density of excitations coincides at this point with the stationary one , the last isolated excitation must be distributed or delocalized through the lattice in order to yield the `` correct '' stationary value for the coherences . due to the highly constrained nature of the dynamics",
    "this takes orders of magnitude longer .    in other quantum models with less restrictive constraints , such as the quantum counterpart of the fa model , diagonal and off - diagonal",
    "observables are able to relax simultaneously ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fa ] ) .",
    "the reason is that due to the bidirectional nature of the constraints @xmath91 isolated excitations become delocalized during the relaxation ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fa ] ) .",
    "in contrast with the east model , this leads quickly to an uniform density profile ( i.e. each spin is in the same state , as established by @xmath51 ) which in turn means that also the coherences have reached their stationary value .     and a system size of @xmath72 spins ( time in units of @xmath73 ) .",

    "in order to lift the abstract and seemingly artificial character of the current discussion we will now establish a link to a quantum - optical system , showing that features of the quantum kcms indeed emerge here rather naturally .",
    "specifically , we consider a gas of interacting rydberg atoms under eit conditions , which is currently in the focus of numerous theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite investigations . we show below that the dynamics of this many - body system can indeed be described by a quantum master equation ( [ eq : me ] ) with non - classical jump operators which , in some limit , reduce to those of a quantum kcm very similar to eq .",

    "these results allow us to comment on the appropriateness of current theoretical efforts @xcite that aim at capturing the dynamics of eit rydberg gases with classical rate equations .",
    "some of them employ a description of the dynamics in terms of a classical kcm with constraint function @xmath115 which corresponds to modelling the excited rydberg atoms by hard rods with an _ excluded volume _",
    "a general problem appears to be that in these model descriptions only the ratio of the ( classical ) excitation and de - excitation rates , which enter eqs .",
    "( [ eq : classical_jump_ops ] ) through the parameter @xmath81 , is given .",
    "this is not problematic when when one is interested only in stationary state properties , as e.g. in ref .",
    "however , in order to make a meaningful comparison of the dynamics between the classical excluded volume model and the effective dissipative quantum evolution defined by the jump operators ( [ eq : ryd_quant ] )  which is derived from first principles  we need to find the appropriate absolute timescales , which depend on the choice of the rate @xmath34 .",

    "as an example we choose to monitor the expectation value of the single atom coherence , @xmath127 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : realclas](c ) one can see that @xmath128 relaxes simultaneously with the diagonal observables as in the fa model .",
    "it is important to note , however , that except in the limit @xmath119 the stationary state values of the coherence are not negligible , even being close to the possible maximal value @xmath37 for @xmath129 .",
