    "the properties and dynamics of linear chains of atoms under the nearest - neighbour coupling approximation have been the subject of considerable interest for many decades  @xcite .",
    "recently , a new interest has arisen in linear chains in the context of quantum information and computation  @xcite , where linear chains have been proposed as entanglement carriers that can be relatively easily realized in practice by diverse physical systems such as cold atoms trapped in optical potentials  @xcite , quantum dots  @xcite and josephson junction arrays  @xcite . despite the simplification that takes into account only the nearest neighbour interaction between the atoms ,",
    "the analysis of the properties of a linear chain containing a large number of atoms are still complex .",
    "therefore most of the developments have been focused on the analysis of the energy and entanglement of the ground state only .",
    "numerical results for the ground state energy and two - particle correlation functions were obtained using the modified lanczos method  @xcite . some approximate analytic results for the ground state energy and higher excitations",
    "were also reported  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the thermodynamic properties of a frustrated heisenberg chain were studied  @xcite and fluctuations in the axial ising model were analysed  @xcite .",
    "more recently , numerical investigations were conducted  @xcite , and also the scaling of excitations were analysed  @xcite . the work of lamas _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have introduced approximations for handling a spin chain with different coupling strengths along the chain .",
    "apart from numerical results , an analytic approach of finding the ground state was proposed @xcite , and the properties of frustrated heisenberg chains were also studied @xcite .",
    "as we have already mentioned , exact treatments of linear or closed chains are limited to the studies of energy and entanglement of the ground state or to a small number of atoms of an arbitrary excitation  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we consider the dipole - dipole chain , which is equivalent to an @xmath0 chain in a magnetic field , and derive the characteristic polynomial equation for the energy states and investigate the properties of its solutions .",
    "derivation of the eigenstates of a chain of interacting atoms is of great importance for the study of entanglement creation , its transfer through the chain and stability against the decoherence .",
    "we also go beyond the nearest - neighbour coupling approximation to include the next nearest - neighbour coupling .",
    "it is generally believed that the nearest - neighbour approximation is a correct approach to study the properties and dynamics of linear chains . however , for realistic physical implementations of linear chains some directions of investigations are important such as the role of long range dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "it is the main purpose of this paper to address this issue by considering effects of the next - nearest - neighbour interactions .",
    "we shall deal with the eigenvalue equation for a chain of @xmath1 coupled atoms and extract the characteristic polynomial for the eigenvalue equation of the hamiltonian of the system for a single excitation .",
    "we then propose a technique of expressing the roots of the polynomial in terms of a power series in the coupling constants .",
    "deriving the exact characteristic polynomial moves the research field closer to the goal of exact , analytic results for a chain of arbitrary length and arbitrary excitation , for it is the roots of this polynomial which give the energy eigenvalues of the chain .",
    "we consider a linear chain of @xmath1 identical two - level atoms .",
    "the atoms are assumed to be equally spaced and confined to fixed positions , and each atom can only interact with its nearest neighbours through the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "a schematic of the system is shown in figure [ fig : linearchain_schematic ] .    , and are polarized in the same direction in their dipole moments @xmath2 and their two - level energy structure ( shown beneath each atom ) . ]    the dynamics of the system are governed by the hamiltonian : @xmath3 where the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 describe the nearest - neighbour and next - nearest - neighbour coupling constants , respectively .",
    "the operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 raise and lower the state of the @xmath8-th atom by a single excitation , and @xmath9 .",
    "this definition of @xmath10 makes the energy of the ground state of the system equal to zero .",
    "we first briefly show that the above hamiltonian is equivalent to an @xmath0 chain in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we first express the raising and lowering operators in terms of pauli matrices : @xmath11 these relations identify the internal states of a two - level atom with the @xmath12 component of spin for a spin-@xmath13 particle .",
    "substituting these relations into ( [ eq : bnn_h ] ) and making use of the commutation relations for pauli matrices gives the analogous hamiltonian for a spin chain : @xmath14 ignoring the first term , which just shifts the energy scale , the second term represents the coupling of an external magnetic field to the spins of the particles , while the second and third bracketed terms represent @xmath0 coupling for nearest and next - nearest neighbours .",
    "it is important to note that our work does not depend on specific features of the dipole - dipole interaction ; all of our results are therefore also applicable to spin chains .",
    "we will , however , give specific examples in terms of the dipole - dipole coupled chain to fix our ideas , since it provides an easy way to think of a system described by couplings between raising and lowering operators .",
    "although we will regard @xmath4 and @xmath5 as arbitrary parameters , their magnitudes can be explicitly determined , for the case of dipole - dipole coupling , from the expression  @xcite @xmath15 \\frac{\\cos x_{ij}}{x_{ij } }    + [ 1 - 3(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu } } \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{ij})^2 ]   \\left [ \\frac{\\sin x_{ij}}{x_{ij}^2 } + \\frac{\\cos x_{ij}}{x_{ij}^3 } \\right ] \\right\\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the distance between the atoms @xmath8 and @xmath17 relative to the resonant wavelength @xmath18 of the atomic transition , @xmath19 is the decay rate of the atomic transition , assumed the same for all atoms , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are unit vectors in the direction of the atomic dipole moments and the displacement @xmath22 between the @xmath8-th and @xmath17-th atoms .",
    "the dependence of @xmath23 on the distance between two arbitrary atoms in the chain is illustrated in figure [ fig : dipolegraph ] . in the present case , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "for two different orientations of the atomic dipole moments relative to the interatomic axis , @xmath26 ( solid line ) and @xmath27 ( dashed line ) . ]",
    "we will first derive the eigenvalue equation for the hamiltonian and investigate is its symmetry properties .",
    "this will be followed by a discussion on the form of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "since our system comprises of @xmath1 two - level atoms , it is clear that up to @xmath1 photons may be present in the chain .",
    "we will consider only one - photon states due to the complexity of the problem for higher - order excitations .",
    "single - photon states may be useful in approximating higher - order states .",
    "our goal is to find analytical expressions for the one - photon eigenstates and their energies , which are found by solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is given in ( [ eq : bnn_h ] ) .",
    "we proceed by writing the characteristic equation @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the @xmath33 identity matrix .",
    "the matrix @xmath34 , which represents the eigenvalue equation , is a @xmath1-dimensional five - diagonal matrix with two off - diagonals set by the nearest - neighbour coupling and the other two off - diagonal set by the next - nearest - neighbour coupling . for clarity ,",
    "all entries in a determinant which are zero are simply omitted , and the order of the determinant ( in this case , @xmath1 ) is placed as a subscript on the bottom right - hand corner of the determinant .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath35 are then given by the roots of @xmath36 , i.e. those values of @xmath35 which make @xmath37 .",
    "at this point , we could pick a specific numerical value for @xmath1 and solve for the roots of @xmath36 by expanding out the determinant .",
    "however , we would like to keep our results as general as possible ; we therefore seek an alternate expression for @xmath36 such that it is an analytic function of @xmath1 .",
    "such a form has the advantage that , as evidenced by the final result , one does not need to construct a matrix to find the eigenvalues .",
    "this can be an advantage particularly when @xmath1 is large since less computer memory is required for the calculation .    to find a form of @xmath36 that is analytic in @xmath1",
    ", we first expand the determinant appearing in ( [ eq : tndef ] ) to find a recurrence relation for @xmath36 .",
    "an expansion of the determinant leads to a closed recurrence equation @xmath38 where @xmath39    the next step is to obtain an expression for @xmath36 that does not have any @xmath40 terms in it .",
    "we do this by finding a recurrence relation for @xmath41 .",
    "having then two simultaneous recurrence relations involving @xmath42 s and @xmath43 s , we can then eliminate all the @xmath43 s in the recurrence equation ( [ eq : tndnrecurrence1 ] ) leading to a recurrence relation solely in terms of @xmath42 s .",
    "thus , expanding the determinant @xmath41 along the first column gives @xmath44 it is seen why we insisted on not expanding out the @xmath43 s terms in ( [ eq : tndnrecurrence1 ] ) .",
    "this procedure would be equivalent to repeatedly substituting ( [ eq : tndnrecurrence2 ] ) , which would not end until all the rows of @xmath36 have been laplace expanded .",
    "this would give us an effectively useless @xmath1-term recurrence relation since the number of terms grows with @xmath1 .",
    "we now use ( [ eq : tndnrecurrence2 ] ) to eliminate the @xmath45 term from ( [ eq : tndnrecurrence1 ] ) .",
    "this step gives @xmath46 next , by adding @xmath47 to both sides of the above equation , we find @xmath48 since @xmath49 , as it is seen from ( [ eq : tndnrecurrence2 ] ) , we finally arrive to the recurrence relation for @xmath34 : @xmath50 the recurrence relation ( [ eq : tnrecurrence ] ) looks complicated and does not reveal any similarities to the well known recurrence relations for special functions .",
    "therefore , we will try to find a non - recursive form for @xmath36 .",
    "since the recurrence relation ( [ eq : tnrecurrence ] ) is a linear homogeneous equation with constant coefficients , we let @xmath51 to form the characteristic equation @xmath52 the roots of the characteristic equation can be easily found , and are of the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 thus , with the roots ( [ e13 ] ) , the general solution to the recurrence relation ( [ eq : tnrecurrence ] ) can be written as @xmath56 where the parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are arbitrary constants .",
    "these constants are determined by requiring that ( [ eq : tngeneralarb ] ) gives the correct result for five different values of @xmath1 .",
    "we chose @xmath60 through to @xmath61 inclusive ( the specific choices for @xmath1 does not matter ; the constants will not change ) .",
    "this gives us a set of five simultaneous equations or `` boundary conditions '' in the five unknowns @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , which is sufficient to give unique values for these parameters .",
    "these boundary conditions force the five arbitrary constants to take on the following values : @xmath62}{2 \\delta   ( a^2 + 8b^2 -4b \\lambda ) } , \\label{eq : ppm}\\\\ q_{\\pm }   & = &   \\mp \\frac{\\lambda ( \\lambda+2b-\\delta ) -2a^2}{2 \\delta \\sqrt{\\chi_{-}^2 -4b^2 } } - \\frac{\\chi_{-}+b}{2\\delta } - \\frac{b [ 2b ( \\delta + 2b + 3 \\chi_{- } ) -a^2]}{2 \\delta   ( a^2 + 8b^2 -4b",
    "\\lambda ) } .\\label{eq : qpm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in principle , we have found the expression for @xmath34 that we were looking for , i.e. one that is a function of @xmath1 .",
    "however , it is somewhat unwieldy , and we will see in the next subsection that it can indeed be simplified .",
    "the solution ( [ eq : tngeneralarb ] ) can be simplified to a compact form . to show this ,",
    "let us consider the ordinary power series generating function of @xmath36 : @xmath63 from ( [ eq : tngeneralarb ] ) , we clearly have the equality @xmath64 which , after the substitution of ( [ eq : ppm ] ) and ( [ eq : qpm ] ) , becomes @xmath65 here we see the remarkable result that despite the complexity of the coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath59 in ( [ eq : ppm ] ) and ( [ eq : qpm ] ) , the resulting generating function is relatively simple",
    ". we may proceed further and find that it may be expressed as follows : @xmath66 one can recognize that the two terms enclosed by parentheses are the ordinary power series generating functions of the chebyshev polynomials of the second kind @xcite : @xmath67 we can therefore write @xmath68 b^n z^n.\\ ] ] expanding @xmath69 and using the cauchy product gives @xmath70 \\right\\ } b^n z^n.\\ ] ] the function @xmath36 may thus be expressed as follows : @xmath71 +   \\sum_{k=0}^{n } \\left [ u_k \\left ( \\frac{\\chi_{+}}{2b } \\right ) - u_k \\left ( \\frac{\\chi_{-}}{2b }",

    "hence @xmath83 is always real .",
    "this requires @xmath81 to be of the form @xmath84 , @xmath85 or @xmath86 , where @xmath87 . in terms of @xmath81",
    ", we find that @xmath88 where @xmath89    we thus have arrived at an expression for @xmath36 in a very simple form given in terms of chebyshev polynomials of the second kind : @xmath90 ^ 2 -   \\left [ u_{n+1 } \\left ( \\gamma \\rme^{-\\rmi \\alpha } \\right ) \\right]^2 \\right\\}. \\label{eq : tnfinalform}\\ ] ] the relation given in ( [ eq : tnfinalform ] ) is the principal result of the paper .",
    "its importance for our work is that we have turned the determinantal form of @xmath36 into an expression which is an analytic function of @xmath1 if we make use of the trigonometric definition of the chebyshev polynomials .",
    "if the exact roots of this equation could be found , we would have the explicit energy eigenvalues for single - photon states , valid for arbitrary chain lengths and coupling constants . despite this complication",
    ", we can obtain the explicit energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors for some special cases .",
    "we now proceed to illustrate the explicit analytical solutions of ( [ eq : tnfinalform ] ) for some simplified cases of chains of coupled atoms .",
    "we first consider the case of no nearest - neighbour interaction , @xmath91 .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : bnn_chainsplit ] , turning off the nearest - neighbour interaction effectively reduces the chain into two distinct subchains that do not interact with each other .",
    "let us consider a concrete example , a chain of five atoms only , as shown in figure [ fig : bnn_chainsplit_odd ] ( a ) . since the even - indexed atoms do not interact with the odd - indexed atoms , we are free to move them away from each other for clarity , as shown in figure [ fig : bnn_chainsplit_odd ] ( b ) . notice that a photon that originated from either subchain has no way of being transferred to the other subchain .",
    "thus , a five atom chain with the nearest - neighbour interaction ignored is equivalent to two sub - chains , one with three and the other with two atoms .",
    "this effect can also be seen in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : bnn_h ] ) .",
    "when we put @xmath92 in the hamiltonian , we obtain @xmath93 it is evident that a photon in the `` even '' chain will never migrate to the `` odd '' chain , and vice versa .            in practice , the procedure of removing the nearest - neighbour interaction can arise in two different ways :    * for critical values of @xmath94 such that the nearest - neighbour coupling vanishes while the next - nearest - neighbour coupling does not .",
    "this happens for example when @xmath94 is equal to 4.48 , 7.72 , @xmath95 for the case when @xmath96 . * separating all the even - indexed atoms from the odd - indexed atoms by an infinite distance  effectively forming two chains that are infinitely separated from each other .    the other case to consider is in the limit @xmath97 , which switches off the next - nearest - neighbour interaction",
    "this is common practice when using the nearest - neighbour approximation .",

    "the factors @xmath99 that appear in the characteristic polynomial ( [ eq : tnfinalform ] ) reduce to @xmath100 and @xmath101 we also have @xmath102 therefore in the limit of @xmath98 @xmath103 ^ 2 - \\left [ u_{n+1 } \\left ( 0 \\right ) \\right]^2 \\right\\ } .\\label{eq : tn_lim_a0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq : tn_lim_a0 ] ) takes two different forms depending on whether @xmath104 is even or odd .",
    "if @xmath104 is an odd integer , then @xmath105 , and we are left with the equation @xmath106 .",
    "this equation has @xmath104 roots given by @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "we disregard the trivial root @xmath109 when @xmath110 , since the trivial root is cancelled out by the factor @xmath111 present in the denominator of @xmath36 .",
    "the remaining @xmath1 eigenvalues @xmath112 are given by @xmath113 where @xmath108 , excluding @xmath110 .",
    "since the eigenvalues associated with @xmath114 equal those with @xmath115 , we can simplify the range of @xmath73 to @xmath116 , and state that the eigenvalues are _ doubly degenerate_. this is consistent with the idea that the chain should behave like two chains of length @xmath117 in this case .    for @xmath104",
    "even , @xmath118 ^ 2 = 1 $ ] , and therefore we look for the solutions of the equation @xmath119 , which are of the form @xmath120 this implies that the eigenvalues of the one - photon states are of the form @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are sets of integers that we will determine below .",
    "the result ( [ e42 ] ) is the analytical solution for the energies of one - photon states of a chain of @xmath1 atoms with the next - nearest - neighbour interaction only .",
    "we see that the energies , and thus the energy states , group into two separate manifolds .",
    "this is what we would expect from the above analysis of a simplified problem of five atom chain that in the limit of @xmath92 the atom chain effectively decouples into two separate chains . when the number of atoms is even , we have two sub - chains of equal length ( @xmath117 ) , and therefore doubly - degenerate energy levels .",
    "when the chain has an odd number of atoms , it decouples into two chains of unequal length : @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "this observation leads us to the following restrictions on the values of @xmath73 : @xmath126 which gives us a total of @xmath1 eigenvalues for the energies of the one - photon states .",
    "we now illustrate the rigorous solution for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the other extreme case of no next - nearest - neighbour interaction , @xmath97 . according to ( [ eq : gammadef ] ) , taking the limit @xmath97 is equivalent to @xmath127 .    expanding the chebyshev polynomials in ( [ eq : tnfinalform ] )",

    "these solutions are given by @xmath133 for @xmath134 .",
    "we thus obtain the energy eigenvalues @xmath135 which agrees with the result of lieb , schultz and mattis @xcite , who made use of the jordan - wigner transform to diagonalize the hamiltonian of the nearest - neighbour @xmath136 chain .",
    "an alternative derivation that does not use the jordan - wigner transform , but is restricted to the @xmath0 chain , is given in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will outline a power series approximation of finding the roots of the general characteristic polynomial ( [ eq : tnfinalform ] ) . in order to find the roots of @xmath36 ,",
    "let us look closely into the procedure of solving the following equation @xmath137 ^ 2 -   \\left [ u_{n+1 } \\left ( \\gamma \\rme^{-\\rmi \\alpha }",

    ", @xmath167 is large enough to show this limiting behaviour .    where the lines cross , the eigenstates associated with the two levels are clearly degenerate .",
    "we therefore have the interesting effect that including the next - nearest neighbour effect can induce degeneracy , which is not present in one - photon states when @xmath127 ( i.e. @xmath160 ) .",
    "these states are degenerate , however , when @xmath154 .",
    "when considering these pairs of degenerate states , we see that the highest pair has only one degenerate point ( at @xmath154 ) .",

    "the solutions in terms of @xmath81 also have interesting properties .",
    "these are obtained by simply solving ( [ eq : tnfinalform ] ) for @xmath81 , which has to be done numerically for the time being , since an analytic solution has not been found yet for arbitrary @xmath129 .",
    "consider figure [ fig : bnn : n4_abs_alpha ] , which shows the absolute value of the solutions @xmath81 for a 4-atom chain .",
    "we see that each solution curve @xmath168 touches the @xmath129 axis at only one location , @xmath169 . furthermore , the curve to the left of @xmath169 is purely imaginary ; to the right , it is real .",
    "figure [ fig : bnn : n4_imag_alpha ] shows only the imaginary component of @xmath81 ; the plot clearly supports this conclusion .",
    "this is a general trend for positive @xmath129 .",
    "based on similar graphs for longer chains , these real - imaginary crossover points always occur for @xmath170 ; we can therefore conclude that for @xmath171 , all solutions are real for positive @xmath129 .",
    "it is our hope that by pointing out this general feature that the solution curves turn through a right angle in the complex plane for some critical value of @xmath129 for @xmath170 , light is shed on the possible forms an analytic solution could have",

    "given the eigenvalues @xmath176 associated with the hamiltonian @xmath29 given by ( [ eq : bnn_h ] ) , the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath177 for single - photon excitations can be derived as follows .",
    "let the eigenvector @xmath177 be given by a linear superposition @xmath178 where @xmath179 is an eigenvector of @xmath180 for all @xmath134 .",
    "the eigenvalue equation @xmath181 implies that @xmath182 for @xmath183 ( and we have set @xmath184 without loss of generality for simplicity ) , and @xmath185 equation ( [ eq : eigvecrecurrence ] ) is valid for all @xmath186 provided we impose the boundary conditions @xmath187 these boundary conditions merely force ( [ eq : eigvecrecurrence ] ) to reproduce ( [ eq : eigvecrecurrencea ] ) , ( [ eq : eigvecrecurrenceb ] ) , and ( [ eq : eigvecrecurrencec ] ) .",

    "then @xmath191 this quadratic expression has the two solutions @xmath192 we then have two solutions for @xmath84 : @xmath193 we can therefore write the coefficients @xmath194 as @xmath195 where @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath168 , and @xmath43 are arbitrary constants whose values are derived by imposing the boundary conditions ( [ eq : eigvecboundaryconditions ] ) . we notice , however , that we have four boundary conditions , thus the naive solution to this system of equations is that @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath168 , and @xmath43 vanish .",
    "however , these four boundary conditions can not be linearly independent ; one of the arbitrary constants should be undetermined so that we can impose an arbitrary normalisation on the eigenstate .",
    "this means that we really have three independent equations . without knowing the specific form of the energy eigenvalue as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , however",
    ", we can not tell which boundary condition is a trivial consequence of the other three .",

    "we have illustrated the exact analytical solutions of the characteristic polynomial for two simplified cases of no nearest - neighbour coupling and no next - nearest - neighbour coupling .",
    "we have also derived the power series solution of the general characteristic polynomial .",
    "we have shown that there are patterns as to how many times a pair of eigenstates become degenerate .",
    "we have also outlined a simple approach by which the energy eigenstates for single excitations may be found .",
    "we hope that our presentation provides tools for further advancement towards an analytic solution for the energy eigenvalues of arbitrary excited linear chains and in the analytic studies and understanding of the energy structure of linear chains of coupled atoms and also to simplification of the mathematics involved .",
