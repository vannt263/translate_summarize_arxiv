    "diffusion in heterogeneous and porous materials @xcite , composed of two or more types of regions with very different diffusion properties , can be described as a sequence of independent scattering events occurring in the hard - scattering part of the material , followed by long jumps performed at almost constant velocity in non - scattering regions .",
    "the single - particle dynamics thus amount to a random walk , where each step length @xmath0 is a random variable with a given probability distribution @xmath1 .",
    "as it is well known , if @xmath0 has a finite variance , the ensuing process follows the standard laws of brownian motion .",
    "if instead the material is very heterogeneous on all scales , the step length distribution may become heavy - tailed and when @xmath2 diverges the diffusion can become anomalous @xcite . whenever the detailed structure of the underlying scattering media can be ignored ( _ annealed _ disorder ) , the dynamics is only ruled by the behavior of @xmath1 for large @xmath0 and the model corresponds to a standard lvy walk @xcite .",
    "if instead one takes into account that the steps are correlated by their mutual positions in the sample , the step length distribution represents a _ quenched _ disorder .",
    "it is argued that quenched and annealed disorder differ in many respects @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting application is multiple scattering of light in disordered media , which can often be described as a random walk process , analogous to the brownian motion of massive particles @xcite . in that case , if scattering elements are homogeneously distributed in space , one usually observes diffusive transport . however , when the local density of scattering elements is strongly inhomogeneous , the optical transport properties of a material can change dramatically and lead to superdiffusion , as exemplified for instance by photon diffusion through clouds @xcite .",
    "more recently , artificial materials have been assembled in the lab that allowed for an unprecedented experimental demonstration of light superdiffusion @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in experiments a change in the optical density of the diffusive media allows to tune the so called scattering length ( or scattering mean free path ) @xcite , which is a measure of the probability of experiencing a scattering event @xcite .",
    "also monte carlo simulations @xcite indicate that this is an important parameter , that may significantly affect the observability of asymptotic scaling regimes .",
    "it is thus important to asses the role of the scattering lengths on scaling properties of relevant observables , starting with probability distributions , to interpret correctly experiments and simulations in inhomogeneous scattering media .",
    "while in pure diffusive processes a varying scattering length can be simply encoded in a trivial change of the variance of the gaussian distributions , superdiffusive process have not been investigated in details .",
    "many relevant features of experiments on scattering in inhomogeneous media can be described as a random walk in a quenched , long - range correlated environment .",
    "the simplest case consists of a free particle moving through a one - dimensional array of barriers whose spacing is power - law distributed @xcite . to address the question discussed above , in this work we extend such models to the case in which the transmittance through each barrier can be tuned to be different from @xmath3 .",
    "this models a situation in which the velocity in the scattering media is not fully randomized at each collision . changing the barrier transmittance",
    "is thus akin to changing the scattering length in the diffusive portion of the material .    in the following",
    ", we will show that the probability distribution for the random walker to be a time @xmath4 in the point @xmath5 exhibits a scaling form and that the effect of varying the transmittance can be reabsorbed in the multiplicative coefficient of the scaling length of the process .",
    "numerical simulations confirm this superscaling behavior and evidence that not only the dynamical exponents are universal , as expected from the general scaling framework , but also the scaling functions are unchanged .",
    "notice that the latter are in general not gaussian in these systems .",
    "moreover , we obtain an analytic expression for the multiplicative coefficient of the scaling length as a function of the transmittance both in the annealed and in the quenched models ; in the annealed case the analytic form is calculated by solving directly the master equation of the process ; in the quenched models it can be derived , within the scaling hypothesis , by considering an extended einstein relation between the stationary conduction and the ( super)diffusion .",
    "interestingly such coefficient turns out to be different in the quenche and in the annealed models and , in the latter case , it is independent of the transmittance when superdiffusion is present .",
    "this evidences another relevant difference between the two approaches .",
    "finally , we apply the same scaling picture , as a function of the transmittance , to the time resolved transmitted intensity through a finite sample of length @xmath6 and to the total transmission , which are the quantities usually measured in experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we define the random and fractal quasi - lattices models with arbitrary transmittance , introducing the scaling picture and the superuniversal behavior . in section [ sec : annealed ] we calculate the exact expression , as a function of the transmittance , of the multiplicative coefficient for the scaling length in the annealed case . in section [ sec : quenched ] we turn to the quenched random and fractal quasi - lattices and we obtain an exact expression for the coefficients in these cases . in section",
    "[ sec : numerics ] we analyze the superscaling framework for random structures with lvy parameter @xmath7 , a case with non gaussian scaling functions .",
    "then , we focus on random structures with @xmath8 , where the gaussian scaling function obeys superscaling , but a subleading term determines the moments of the distribution .",
    "we evidence that also this subleading term can be studied in terms of a change in the multiplicative constant for the scaling length .",
    "we finally verify the superscaling framework in the deterministic case with @xmath9 where the scaling function presents log - periodic oscillations @xcite . in section [ sec : timeres ]",
    "we apply our superscaling approach to a different physical quantity , the time resolved transmission intensity , which is relevant for a realistic experimental setup in inhomogeneous optical media . in the last section we present our conclusions .",
    "we consider a continuous time random walk on one - dimensional structures ( see fig .",
    "[ model ] ) , where point - like scatterers are spaced according to a lvy distribution .",
    "the walker moves with constant velocity @xmath10 in between each two consecutive scatterers .",
    "when it arrives at a scatterer , it can reverse its direction of motion ( @xmath11 ) with probability @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 ) .",
    "clearly , @xmath14 is conserved during the evolution and we can set @xmath15 without loss of generality .",
    "we investigate two types of structures .",
    "the first is random and ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ model ] ) the probability for two consecutive scatterers , labeled by the indexes @xmath16 and @xmath17 , to be at distance @xmath5 is @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a cutoff fixing the scale length of the system .",
    "the second type is a class of deterministic quasi - lattices ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ model ] ) , built by placing the scatterers on generalized cantor sets @xcite .",
    "each set , and the ensuing step length distribution , is defined by the two parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 used in its recursive construction .",
    "the former represents the growth of the longest step when the structures is increased by a generation , so that the longest step in a structure of generation @xmath23 is proportional to @xmath24 ; @xmath22 is the number of copies of generation @xmath25 that form the generation @xmath23 , so that the total number of scatterers in the generation @xmath23 is proportional to @xmath26 ( see ref.@xcite for details ) . for this second type of structures , the role of the exponent @xmath27 of the random case",
    "is played by @xmath28 @xcite .    in the random case",
    ", we will average over different realizations of the structure and we will consider averages taken over processes starting from scattering sites .",
    "for quenched lvy processes , it is known that different averaging procedures can lead to different behaviors .",
    "moreover , properties arising from averages taken over processes starting in any point are different @xcite . in the deterministic case ,",
    "we consider averages performed over random trajectories starting from a given point , e.g the origin @xmath29 evidenced in fig .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "the main quantity we are interested in is the probability for a walker to be at time @xmath4 a distance @xmath5 from the starting point , which we denote by @xmath30 to emphasize the dependence on the two basic parameters of this class of models , @xmath27 and @xmath31 .",
    "the process on a lvy structure with given @xmath27 can be described by introducing a scaling function @xmath32 and a scaling length @xmath33 growing with time @xcite .",
    "the scaling form for @xmath30 can be written as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a function that vanishes in probability for large times : @xmath36 in @xcite , the scaling form , , has been analyzed in details and it has been shown to hold for @xmath37 . moreover ,",
    "the growth of @xmath38 has been shown to follow the asymptotic law @xmath39 for @xmath9 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "the presence of the subleading function @xmath42 and of long tails in @xmath32 , induce a nontrivial scaling of higher - order momenta , @xmath43 , leading to strongly anomalous diffusion @xcite .    here",

    "before discussing the effect of the transmittance @xmath31 in quenched systems , we consider the annealed case , where the length of the ballistic stretches is chosen randomly from the distribution independently at each scattering event . in this case",
    "the topology of the system is not taken into account and only the distribution of the steps influences the dynamics . in this simpler situation ,",
    "an analytical approach is feasible and the behavior of the scaling length as a function of the transmittance can be determined .",
    "let us introduce @xmath50 and @xmath51 as the probabilities of being in @xmath5 at time @xmath4 arriving respectively from the left and from the right . in the persistent random walk approach",

    "in particular in the asymptotic regime for large space and times , i.e. for @xmath55 and @xmath56 going to zero , we have the following estimates : @xmath57 where the complex constants @xmath58 depend on the distribution @xmath59 ( i.e. on @xmath27 ) but are independent of @xmath31 .",
    "the asymptotic scaling form of @xmath30 can then be obtained by inverting the fourier transform in . in particular we have : @xmath60 with @xmath61 where the function @xmath62 and proportionality constants in are independent of @xmath31 .",
    "as expected , the dynamical exponents in equation coincides with the well known results for the annealed lvy walks with @xmath37 , established in @xcite .",
    "in addition , equations ( [ panscal],[ell_an ] ) show that both the dynamical exponents and the scaling function @xmath62 are independent of @xmath31 , even in the non trivial case of anomalous diffusion i.e. @xmath63 . moreover , quite surprisingly for @xmath63 , i.e. in the ballistic and superdiffusive cases , even the coefficient of the scaling length does not depend on the transmittance and therefore the whole asymptotic regime is independent of the value of @xmath31 . on the other hand , for @xmath64",
    "the same coefficient depends in a non trivial way both on @xmath31 and on the step length distribution @xmath59 .",
    "indeed , @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "in particular , for the step lengh distribution considered in , @xmath67 . notice that the diffusivity diverges for @xmath68 ( perfect transmission ) , while for @xmath69 it vanishes only for @xmath70 , hence only when the step lengths do not fluctuate .",
