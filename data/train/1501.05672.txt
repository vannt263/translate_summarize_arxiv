    "the most well - studied collections of orthogonal polynomials come from measures of orthogonality supported on the real line and are known as orthogonal polynomials on the real line ( oprl ) .",
    "such polynomials have a variety of applications in spectral theory ( see @xcite ) , potential theory ( see @xcite ) , and the theory of special functions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the key features of oprl is the three - term recurrence formula satisfied by the orthonormal polynomials .",
    "many well - known families of oprl ( including the hermite polynomials , the laguerre polynomials , and the jacobi polynomials ) are polynomial solutions to particular families of linear second order differential equations with polynomial coefficients .",

    "therefore , to each infinitely supported probability measure @xmath0 on the unit circle , we can associate the sequence @xmath13 of _ verblunsky coefficients_. a theorem of verblunsky states that such a sequence also determines an infinitely supported probability measure ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "to this end , ismail and witte proved the following result in @xcite :    let @xmath14 be differentiable in a neighborhood of the unit circle , have moments of all integral orders , and assume that the integrals @xmath15 exist for all integers @xmath7 .",
    "then the corresponding orthonormal polynomials satisfy the differential relation @xmath16    from this result , one can derive a second order differential equation to which @xmath17 is a solution ; we refer the reader to @xcite for details .",

    "it is well - known and easy to show that all of the zeros of @xmath20 are distinct and lie on the unit circle .",

    "one of our main results is the next theorem , which can be thought of as an analog of the ismail and witte result that applies to paraorthogonal polynomials .",
    "in fact , the theorem applies to any degree @xmath7 monic polynomial satisfying the relation ( [ popucdef ] ) for some complex number @xmath18 . as in @xcite , we write a measure on the unit circle as a measure in the variable @xmath26 . for brevity and because there is no possibility for confusion , we will suppress the @xmath0-dependence of various quantities in our notation .",

    "it is not surprising that a particular configuration of charges can be in equilibrium with respect to different electric fields , so from a physical perspective , the lack of uniqueness of the differential equation is also expected .",
    "an intermediate step in the proof of theorem [ mainode ] is of interest in its own right and can be stated as follows :    [ sysodes ] suppose @xmath0 is as in theorem [ mainode ] and @xmath48 are distinct complex numbers .",

    "in fact , in the pre - image of any such paraorthogonal polynomial is a measure that satisfies the hypotheses of the above theorems .",

    "orthogonal polynomials have proven to be useful tools when studying the equilibrium positions of electrons that repel each other via the two - dimensional coulomb interaction .",
    "it was stieltjes work that lead to the discovery that if @xmath80 particles are confined to the interval @xmath81 $ ] interacting by means of a logarithmic ( i.e. coulomb ) potential , then the unique energy minimizing configuration consists of one particle located at @xmath19 , one located at @xmath82 , and the other @xmath83 particles located at the ( distinct ) zeros of a particular jacobi polynomial ( see @xcite and see @xcite for a proof ) .",
    "the key step in the proof of this fact is rewriting the equilibrium condition on a collection of points as a second order linear differential equation that is solved by the polynomial with zeros at precisely those points and then recognizing that a jacobi polynomial with the appropriate choice of parameters is a solution to this differential equation ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "further developments in the electrostatic interpretation of zeros of orthogonal polynomials on the real line can be found in @xcite .",
    "our main application of the results in section [ intro ] will be to demonstrate that the zeros of certain families of popuc are the locations of points that are in electrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we will use the convention ( as in @xcite ) that if a particle of charge @xmath84 is located at a point @xmath85 and a particle of charge @xmath86 is located at a point @xmath87 , then the force on the particle at @xmath88 due to the particle at @xmath89 is @xmath90 .",
    "we will consider the problem of creating an electric field that will keep identical charges at fixed points on the unit circle stationary . more precisely ,",
