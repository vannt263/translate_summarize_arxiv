    ", the computation of trajectories is very well controlled numerically .",
    "numerical methods are preferred mainly for their convenience and accuracy , especially when making comparisons with respect to the observations or their flexibility whatever the perturbation to be treated .",
    "conversely , analytical theories optimize the speed of calculations , allow to study precisely the dynamics of an object or to study particular classes of useful orbits .",
    "however , the calculation of the heo can still be greatly improved , especially as regards the analytical theories .",
    "indeed , when we are dealing with this type of orbit , we have to face several difficulties . due to the fact that they cover a wide range of altitudes , the classification of the perturbations acting on an artificial satellite , space debris , etc .",

    "* ) changes with the position on the orbit . at low altitude ,",
    "the quadrupole moment @xmath0 is the dominant perturbation , while at high - altitude the lunisolar perturbations can reach or exceed the order of the @xmath0 effect .",
    "one of the issues concerns the expansion of the third - body disturbing function in orbital elements .",
    "the importance of the lunisolar perturbations in the determination on the motion of an artificial satellite was raised by  @xcite . using a disturbing function truncated to the second degree in the spherical harmonic expansion",
    ", he showed that certain long - periodic terms generate large perturbations on the orbital elements , and therefore , the lifetime of a satellite can be greatly affected .",
    "later , @xcite took into account the third harmonic .",
    "@xcite introduced the inclination and eccentricity special functions , fundamental for the analysis of the perturbations of a satellite orbit .",
    "this enabled him to give in @xcite the first general expression of the third - body disturbing function using equatorial elements for the satellite and the disturbing body ; the function is expanded using fourier series in terms of the mean anomaly and the so - called hansen coefficients depending on the eccentricity  @xmath2 in order to obtain perturbations fully expressed in orbital elements .",
    "it was noticed by @xcite that , concerning the moon , it is more suitable to parametrize its motion in ecliptic elements rather than in equatorial elements . indeed , in this frame , the inclination of the moon is roughly constant and the longitude of its right ascending node can be considered as linear with respect to time . in light of this observation , @xcite established the disturbing function of an earth s satellite due to the moon s attraction , using the ecliptic elements for the latter and the equatorial elements for the satellite .",
    "some algebraic errors have been noticed in @xcite , but it is only recently that the expression has been corrected and verified in @xcite .",
    "the main limitation of these papers is that they suppose truncations from a certain order in eccentricity . generally , the truncation is not explicit because there is no explicit expansion in power of the eccentricity .",
    "but in practice , fourier series of the mean anomaly which converge slowly must be truncated and this relies mainly on the dalembert rule ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which guarantees an accelerated convergence as long as the eccentricity is small . because this is indeed the case of numerous natural bodies or artificial satellites , these expansions of the disturbing function are well suited in many situations",
    "however , for the orbits of artificial satellites having very high eccentricities , any truncation with respect to the eccentricity is prohibited .",
    "@xcite investigated this situation .",
    "they showed that the series in multiples of the elliptic anomaly @xmath3 , first introduced by @xcite and studied later by @xcite , converge faster than the series in multiples of any classical anomaly in many cases .",
    "this was confirmed by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the introduction of the elliptic anomaly increases seriously the complexity , involving in particular elliptical functions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the same paper , they provided the expressions of the fourier coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 in terms of hypergeometric functions , coming from the fourier series expansion of the elliptic motion functions in terms of the true anomaly and of the eccentric anomaly , respectively .",
    "more discussions and examples can be found in  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the expansion must be supple enough to define a trade - off between accuracy and complexity for each situation .",
    "to this end , the use of special functions is well suited to build a closed - form analytical model , like in the theory of @xcite for a lunar artificial satellite .",
    "development can be compact , easy to manipulate and the extension of the theory can be chosen for each case by fixing the limits on the summations .",
    "the complexity is relegated in the special functions , knowing that efficient algorithms exist to compute them . in short",
    ", we shall use the expression of the disturbing function introduced in @xcite and @xcite , mixing mainly the compactness of formulation in exponential form and the convergence of series in eccentric anomaly .",
    "besides the question of large eccentricities , the other issue concerns the explicit time - dependency due to the motion of the disturbing body . in the classical analytical theory , this is almost always ignored ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while it should be taken into account when constructing an analytical solution , in particular by means of canonical transformations .",
    "to do this , the key point is to start from a disturbing function using angular variables which are time linear .",
    "this is precisely the motivation to use ecliptic elements instead of equatorial elements for the moon perturbation , as explained above . in this situation , the pde ( partial differential equation ) that we have to solve to construct an analytical theory takes the following form:@xmath6 unfortunately",
    ", this mechanics is broken as soon as the fast variable of the satellite motion is no longer the mean anomaly @xmath7 , but the eccentric anomaly @xmath8 . in this case , the equation to solve looks like@xmath9 which admits no exact solution .    in this work",
