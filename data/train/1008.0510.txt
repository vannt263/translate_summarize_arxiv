    "the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ? * sdss ) provides a large data base of photometry for galaxies and stars , over 350 million objects in the 11663 square degree survey area , that can be used for a great variety of astrophysical science @xcite . besides its scale , another very important feature is the special care that has been paid to maintain the accuracy of the data , especially their photometric accuracy , from instrumentation throughout the eight year period of the survey .",
    "the photometric system is different from systems which have been traditionally used , so it must be internally defined consistently over that period .",
    "in addition , the survey attempted to apply photometric calibration to the over 1 million spectra obtained during the survey , and we will study this calibration as well .",
    "one of the important issues is the consistency between spectrophotometry and broad - band photometry with the five passbands , in the sense that the integral of spectrophotometric data with the determined response functions should give the proper broad - band flux .",
    "this has been a perennial problem inherent with the data bases available to date .",
    "synthetic colours obtained by integrating spectrophotometric data often give systematically increasing error with colours as obtained by broad band photometry , typically of the order of 0.1 mag , or sometimes larger , for stars for a range in @xmath1 from 0 to 1 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is probably largely to be attributed to a poor characterisation of the response functions of conventional detector systems .    in order to minimise these systematic errors and make the broad - band photometry as well specified as possible , much effort was invested in the sdss to characterise the response functions @xcite , in addition to a chain of stellar calibrations @xcite .",
    "the response functions for sdss photometry have been measured on site a number of times during the survey , which enables us to characterise their seasonal and secular variations .",
    "this work has been published in @xcite , where the representative response functions are also presented as the _ reference response functions _ of the 2.5 m telescope @xcite .",
    "these average response functions are recommended to be used unless the user s interests are in fine details .",
    "it is demonstrated in @xcite that the stellar data taken in the early period of the survey are consistent with those acquired in the later period within 0.01 mag after calibration , including the data for the @xmath2 passband which has suffered from a significant secular change in the system response and , therefore , the expected variations in photometry have been well compensated by the calibration process .",
    "it is concluded that the errors due to time varying changes , both seasonal and secular , in the response functions and calibration procedures that use several different systems are no more than 0.01 mag as a whole .",
    "the other special feature of the sdss observation is hourly monitoring of the atmospheric extinction with the ancillary 50-cm photometric telescope ( pt ) .",
    "a set of the sdss standard stars were observed every night , together with hourly observation of stars in the transfer fields from pt to the 2.5-m main telescope .",
    "the sdss standard stars are chosen as uniformly as possible both over the northern sky and in colour space so that they are not inclined to give weight towards particular classes of stars @xcite .",
    "for other efforts to maintain the accuracy of the photometry , see @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the photometric accuracies and properties of the data presented in the sdss catalogues , which are already in the public domain .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine , in particular , ( i ) the consistency between spectrophotometry and broad - band photometry , including the verification of the response functions for broad band photometry , ( ii ) the overall accuracy of photometric calibrations against standard stars , ( iii ) the location of stars in colour space in the sdss photometric system and its variation with the atmospheric parameters of stars , such as effective temperature , surface gravity and metallicity , ( iv ) colours of galaxies relative to stars , and ( v ) brightness and colour of the sun in the sdss photometric system .",
    "one of the important purposes of ( iii ) is to locate stars of known spectral type in colour space so that approximate spectral type can be inferred from colours of the sdss photometric system .",
    "we also give effective temperature for those stars .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for an earlier study along these lines .",
    "there is also a substantial amount of work done for observations of stars and for determinations of the atmospheric parameters in _ sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration _ ( segue ) under the sdss project ( see , @xcite ) . here",
    ", the problem is that the sdss acquired spectra of stars fainter than @xmath3 , whereas the stars for which high resolution spectra are available needed to determine the atmospheric parameters are brighter , such as @xmath4 ( nb : @xmath5 ) : hence , the overlap of the samples is small , which makes well - calibrated stellar science with the sdss not so straightforward .",
    "this also remains as our problem and we attempt to circumvent it by the use of bright sdss standard stars , or of spectrophotometric standard stars after verifying their brightness in the sdss photometric system .    the procedure of sdss broad band photometry is described in @xcite ; see also @xcite . in brief it is based on the network of 158 standard stars spanning a wide range of colours , which were measured by separate observations made at usno @xcite using filters and a detector system pseudo - equivalent to the sdss system @xcite with the colour tansformation between the two systems taken into account to offset the slight difference in their response functions .",
    "the zero point is ultimately set by the subdwarf bd@xmath6 whose brightness is defined by a synthetic calculation of the spectrophotometric data @xcite in the ab@xmath7 magnitude system @xcite .",
    "the main telescope data are calibrated using the set of stars which are observed simultaneously with both the main telescope and an ancillary 50 cm photometric telescope , the latter being also used to observe the sdss standard stars whose brightness is set by the work at usno , and to monitor hourly atmospheric extinction during survey operation .",
    "passband ) and 0.02 mag ( @xmath2 and @xmath8 passbands ) ; these differences are smaller than we are concerned with in this paper . ]",
    "spectroscopy was carried out with two fibre - fed double spectrographs covering the wavelength range 3800 to 9200   with two 2048@xmath9-pixel ccd detectors in each spectrograph .",
    "the spectrographs are fed with 640 fibers plugged into an aluminum plate in the focal surface , positioned with the astrometry obtained from the imaging data @xcite .",
    "the mean resolving power is @xmath10 depending on the wavelength .",
    "spectrophotometric calibration is carried out using spectrophotometric standard stars selected in each field .",
    "standard stars were intended to be typically f8 dwarfs @xcite but the set in actuality contains a variety of similar spectral types @xcite ; the spectra are fit to models given by gray et al ( 2001 ) , and the model spectra are used for calibration .",
    "spectrophotometric calibration also requires match between spectrophotometric fluxes and the broad - band photometric psf fluxes .",
    "this is done with a single calibration determined for each camera in a given plate @xcite .",
    "the data acquired in the sdss projects are all published in 7 data releases , dr1@xmath11dr7 @xcite .",
    "all dr data are cumulative , and dr7 stands for the final data release of the sdss i and ii , which employ the original instrumentation of the sdss .",
    "we use the data set from dr6 in the study presented in this paper .",
    "the photometric calibration is made against the set of standard stars .",
    "reddening corrections are not applied for the stars . the stars are located mostly in low extinction regions .",
    "if we take the extinction map of @xcite , the peak of the distribution is at @xmath12 with the mean 0.04 and the variance 0.03 ; only 2.6% of stars are located in the region @xmath13 .",
    "note that this reddening is the maximum value along the line of sight and the actual reddening for objects within the disk of the galaxy is smaller .",
    "in this paper we consider synthetic fluxes , obtained by integrating with the @xmath14 measure over the spectrophotometric data with the response functions for each filter .",
    "the flux calibration of the spectrophotometry was done by comparing the spectrophotometric data with the psf fluxes of the standard stars in each spectroscopic field ( actually two fields independently , one for each spectrograph . )",
    "so , it is important to confirm that synthetic spectrophotometric fluxes indeed agree with broad band photometric fluxes within tolerable errors for the majority of stars across the wide spectral range .    in figure [ fig:1 ] we present the difference of synthetic colours and photometric colours for ( a ) @xmath0 and ( b ) @xmath15 as a function of colours of stars .",
    "stars are taken from the observation for southern equatorial stripe ( stripe 82 ) , and the psf magnitude is adopted for broad band photometry .",
    "the error bar shows the variance in each colour bin , 0.2 mag in @xmath0 or @xmath15 .",
    "the offset of the mean is @xmath16 mag for most of the colour bins , and it increases to 0.08 mag for red stars with @xmath17 .",
    "the rms scatter we have seen is about 0.1 mag , and it goes up to @xmath18 mag towards redder stars with @xmath19 .",
    "this is compared with the rms error quoted for the spectrophotometric calibration , 0.04 mag ( dr7 ) .",
    "the smaller scatter for bluer stars offsets the larger rms scatter in longer wavelengths for the total sample .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath8 passbands are out of the range of our spectroscopy , which spans from 3800  to 9200   and therefore are not shown .",
    "we adopt the sdss spectroscopic data and use the reference response function for the sdss 2.5 m telescope presented in @xcite referred to the standard 1.3 airmass value for the atmospheric extinction corrections .",
    "the global tilt of the offset across colour is small .",
    "after 3@xmath20 rejection of highly deviant data points , the mean gives @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the range @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "this implies that the response curves are well characterised .",
    "synthetic colours may be substituted for broad band measurements at least in the mean over the stars in the sample and for non - variable stars .",
    "we consider that this is an improvement , crudely speaking , of a factor of 5 in accuracy compared with previous ` best ' spectrophotometry - photometry data sets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "highly deviant data points are likely to be variable stars or double stars , as found for subsamples @xcite .",
    "in figure [ fig:2 ] we plot @xmath25 of 290647 stars with @xmath26 against @xmath0 taken from the full dr6 catalogue .",
    "regions of densely populated points are represented by contours , which correspond to an increase of density by @xmath27 in each step .",
    "those denoted by individual points are 2660 stars , or 0.9% of all stars .",
    "the catalogue contains an additional 583 stars that fall outside the range and are not plotted .",
    "we also superimpose the data of 158 sdss standard stars given in @xcite and 175 spectrophotometric stars given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter gs83 ) .",
    "the colour of gs83 stars is derived by synthetic calculations with the reference response function of the 2.5 m telescope system at 1.3 airmass after taking the redleak of the @xmath2-filter into account colour with @xmath28 stars ) .",
    "this is much more than we expect from the difference between the two response functions , @xcite , which was adopted by lenz et al . , and @xcite adopted here .",
    "we expect that the two lead to a difference generally smaller than 0.02 mag and , at largest , @xmath29 mag for @xmath25 colour of red stars .",
    "we could not find the origin of this gross discrepancy . ] .",
    "since the gs stars are mostly located in the low latitude field and receive large reddening , dereddening correction is applied as in gs93 .",
    "it is noted that the reddening model used in that paper is probably oversimple , although the resulting colour does not differ too significantly from what is calculated using a more standard extinction curve .",
    "there are 5 gs83 stars that fall beyond the figure frames and are dropped .",
    "all sdss standard stars are shown .",
    "the redleak affects @xmath25 colour by no more than 0.02 mag for stars with @xmath30 , while it increases to 0.2 mag close to the red edge of the contour , @xmath31 .",
    "recognition of this correction improves agreement between the gs83 stars and other stars , if only slightly .",
    "the three solid squares around @xmath32 represent the metal poor f subdwarfs , bd@xmath6 , bd@xmath33 and bd@xmath34 , the latter two of which were added to the first to set up the network of f - subdwarf standards approximately 8 hours apart @xcite .",
    "accurate spectrophotometry is available only for the first two stars @xcite , but the third is sufficiently similar to the first two that the adopted linear interpolation to obtain its fluxes should be adequate .",
    "we confirmed that the contours of the distribution of stars change only moderately when we take stars of @xmath35 or 19 instead of @xmath36 . the distributions change in detail , doubtless due to the changes in stellar populations from old disk to thick disk and halo as one goes fainter @xcite .",
    "the contours , however , overlap very well for stars bluer than @xmath37 for the 3 samples that differ in brightness , indicating that the calibration is robust against brightness of stars .",
    "we see that both sdss standard stars and gs93 stars are located near the centre of gravity of the distribution of stars in the sdss general sample for @xmath38 .",
    "this also serves , albeit indirectly , as the evidence that spectrophotometry of the gs83 stars and spectroscopic synthesis give correct broad band colours to the level we have required .",
    "we see for red stars with @xmath19 some shift of the loci of these stars towards the upper side , @xmath25 being redder by @xmath39 mag . on the other hand",
    "there appears a second locus of the gs83 stars , which is shifted _ downwards _ by @xmath40 mag with respect to the centre of gravity .",
    "we ascribe this to widening of the gap in colour space between the distribution of luminosity class iii and v stars for @xmath41 , as shown in the next section . for red stars",
    "we observe that the locus of the gs83 stars is more heavily populated around the upper side , to which stars are driven by high metallicity ( nearly solar ) of the gs83 stars . in general , the scatter becomes larger towards the redder end , as a natural wilder variation of spectra due to molecular bands developed in later k to m stars for @xmath42 .",
    "the span of the @xmath25 colour range against the variation of metallicity , and also of gravity , increases towards the reddest stars .    for very blue stars with @xmath43",
    ", the locus of the gs83 stars does not agree with that of sdss standard stars and that of the general sdss stars , by 0.1 mag in @xmath0 or as much as 0.4 mag in @xmath25 .",
    "this is significantly larger than could arise from the different response functions of sdss specifications .",
    "one might suspect that this displacement is due to reddening , especially given the crudity of the gs reddening corrections .",
    "in fact , however , the displacement corresponds approximately to @xmath44 .",
    "such large extinction is very rare in the sdss data , but is present in essentially all the blue gs stars , and is poorly determined .",
    "however , if such corrections are systematic and are made , we would expect shifts in @xmath45 vs @xmath0 , for which the shift ( see figure [ fig:6 ] below ) , if any , takes place in a way opposite to that expected .",
    "note that the standard extinction curve @xcite gives reddening for @xmath15 and @xmath45 smaller than that for @xmath25 only by a factor of two ( see arrows for extinction in figure [ fig:8]-[fig:10 ] below ) . in @xmath15",
    "vs @xmath0 the two loci overlap at a good precision ; see figure [ fig:5 ] below , but the extinction for this colour is nearly parallel to the stellar locus , and it is not easy to separate out extinction .",
    "we thus do not find an easy explanation that accounts for the shift in @xmath25 vs @xmath0 plane between the gs83 stars relative to the sdss stars .",
    "we do note , however , that the _ populations _ of the blue gs stars and the blue sdss stars are completely different ; the blue gs stars are all main - sequence disk population i objects , and the blue sdss stars are essentially all low - mass , hot , highly evolved population ii objects of a variety of types , so the discrepancy may not be surprising .",
    "we note also that the locus of the sdss stars overlaps well that of the sdss standard stars .    to scrutinize the possible offset among the populations in three different star samples , i.e. , the sample in the sdss general catalogue , the sdss standard star sample and the gs83 sample , we plot in figure [ fig:3 ] the distribution of the three populations , projected onto the line orthogonal to @xmath46 which follows the locus of the stellar colour for @xmath47 , indicated as the line segment in figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the distribution of the three f subdwarfs is also shown .",
    "the distance along this base line measured from the locus of the population is denoted by @xmath48 ( mag ) with the positive direction towards the lower right ( increasing @xmath0 and decreasing @xmath25 ) .",
    "we see that all populations are distributed very well with respect to the common zero point , although the distribution for the sdss standard stars is somewhat skewed towards the bluer side , which can be understood by a larger weight of lower metallicity stars in that sample .",
    "no alarming offset is visible in the zero point among the four samples beyond @xmath49 mag in @xmath48 .",
    "the distance @xmath48 is correlated with metallicity .",
    "21 out of the 158 sdss standard stars and 44 out of the 175 gs83 stars are given estimates for metallicity with high resolution spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows those stars having colours in the range @xmath50 plotted in the plane of metallicity versus @xmath48 , indicating the correlation of metallicity with @xmath48 .",
    "it shows that the gs stars plotted in this figure have metallicity close to solar , while many of the sdss standard stars are indeed metal poor [ fe / h]@xmath51 , as expected from the fact that they are mostly high latitude halo objects @xcite .",
    "although these are partial samples of the gs83 and the sdss standard stars , this explains the difference of the two samples we saw in the @xmath25 vs. @xmath0 plane .",
    "we also plot the bundle of line segments which show the prediction of the kurucz atmosphere model @xcite for stars with f2v to g8v , metallicity from [ fe / h]=0.5 being at the top to @xmath52 at the bottom .    a similar plot is shown in figure [ fig:5 ] for @xmath15 vs. @xmath0",
    "the distribution is narrower and the agreement among the three distributions is much tighter than we have seen for @xmath25 vs. @xmath0 .",
    "the sdss standard stars are located very close to the centre of gravity of the general star sample .",
    "the gs83 stars are also located close to the centre of gravity : we observe a slight displacement between the sdss standard star sample and the gs83 star sample , which is of the order of the difference we expect from the different metallicity .",
    "the three f subdwarfs are also on the top of the loci .",
    "the difference in the loci between the luminosity class iii and v is negligibly small , as we see in the next section more quantitatively .",
    "a similar observation holds for the plot of @xmath45 against @xmath0 shown in figure [ fig:6 ]",
    ". we do not observe displacements among the three populations , again except for some disagreement for very blue stars .",
    "otherwise , the distributions of the standard stars and gs83 stars agree well with those of the stars in the sdss general catalogue .",
    "these considerations mean that the stellar loci are well defined in the sdss photometry and depend little on the sample taken , and also verify that the photometric calibration has been made well in colour against the standard stars .",
    "this does not mean that the broad band flux is accurate in physical units ( ab magnitude system ) , however .",
    "the main parameters that regulate colours of stars are effective temperature @xmath53 , surface gravity @xmath54 and metallicity [ fe / h ] .",
    "we first show that @xmath53 is well represented by @xmath0 colour ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the most accurate measurement of @xmath53 is made with michelson interferometry of stars to measure their diameters .",
    "this has been done , however , only for very bright stars and the sample is very limited .",
    "the sample may be extended by stars for which temperatures have been obtained from the infrared flux method ( irfm ) @xcite , which is calibrated against stars with michelson interferometry measurements of high accuracy . the irfm suffers from less model dependence ; temperatures from the irfm method are supposed to be accurate at the 1% level .",
    "the stars with effective temperatures estimated by irfm are still too bright for the main sample of sdss , but the gs83 sample has stars whose effective temperature has been estimated with irfm . the argument in the previous sections ensures that photometry from spectrophotometric synthesis for gs83 stars is sufficiently accurate",
    ".    figure [ fig:7 ] shows colours of 15 gs83 stars against inverse effective temperature that is given in the irfm catalogue of @xcite . among the panels that show @xmath25 , @xmath0 , @xmath15 and @xmath45 colours the correlation with @xmath0 colour is tightest :",
    "the stars are well fitted with the simple formula @xmath55 with an rms scatter around the fit @xmath56 or @xmath57k .",
    "note that the star sample contains different luminosity classes , iii ( 7 stars ) , iv ( 4 stars ) and v ( 4 stars ) , and metallicity is not differentiated .",
    "we do not observe any systematic difference for @xmath0 among the different luminosity classes .",
    "we note , however , that this colour - temperature relation is empirically verified only in the range , @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "the use of the castelli - kurucz atmosphere model ( indicated by the dotted curve in the second panel of figure [ fig:7 ] ) suggests that this inverse linear relation may break down for @xmath60 : for those stars with temperature higher than @xmath61 , @xmath53 is higher than eq.([eqn:1 ] ) indicates for given @xmath0 . a departure from eq.([eqn:1 ] ) is also indicated towards lower temperature below 3850k .",
    "the expression we derived above agrees well with the @xmath62 colour relation given by @xcite but only in a finite segment , @xmath63 , or @xmath64k .",
    "the latter relation gives temperature significantly lower than the irfm estimate for stars redder than @xmath65 .",
    "@xcite use a polynomial which is third order in @xmath0 to estimate @xmath66 from @xmath0 in the segue stellar parameter pipeline .",
    "it agrees with eq .",
    "( [ eqn:1 ] ) within 0.02 dex for the range @xmath67 ( @xmath68k ) .",
    "we see some systematic shifts among different luminosity classes for the @xmath25 vs. inverse temperature plot ; e.g. , all 4 class v stars lie below the fit line , and 6 of the 7 class iii stars lie above the line .",
    "the @xmath45 colour is also well correlated with temperature , the dispersion of @xmath45 being also small ( 0.03 ) .",
    "the corresponding dispersion of temperature , @xmath69k , however , is twice as large as that for the @xmath0 inverse temperature relation due to the shallower slope .",
    "metallicity has been estimated with high resolution spectroscopy @xcite for 9 among the 15 stars given in this figure and it ranges from [ fe / h]=@xmath110.69 to 0.31 .",
    "we do not observe a systematic trend with metallicity in the @xmath0 vs. @xmath53 plot .",
    "the variation with metallicity is significantly smaller than is seen with @xmath1 , since the metal lines are fewer and weaker in the @xmath54 ( and @xmath70 ) passband than in the @xmath71 passband .",
    "the scatter around the colour temperature relation is nearly as small as the one that would be obtained after the metallicity effect taken into account in the @xmath1 - @xmath53 relation , or the @xmath72 - @xmath53 relation for which the smallest scatter has been claimed @xcite .",
    "some metallicity trends are observed for the @xmath25 - @xmath53 plot in the way one would expect , but the present sample is too scanty to derive the metallicity dependence in a meaningful way . we conclude that @xmath0 colour is a good indicator for ( inverse ) temperature , much better than @xmath1 because of weak metal lines in the @xmath54 and @xmath70 passbands .",
    "we repeat in figure [ fig:8 ] , the @xmath25 vs. @xmath0 colour - colour distribution shown in figure [ fig:2 ] . in panel ( a ) the loci of gs83 stars are represented by the two curves , the solid curve for luminosity class v and the dashed curve for class iii .",
    "these curves are drawn by spline - interpolating the mean positions of the gs83 stars that are classified as iii and v. the curve segments that are not constrained well by the data are skipped in the figure .",
    "the ellipses are the areas where gs83 stars with some specified types , a0 and a1 stars ( denoted as a0@xmath111 ) , f0 and f1 stars , g0 , g1 and g2 stars , k0 stars and m0 stars fall ( as indicated ) , where iii and v are not distinguished .",
    "the size of the ellipses corresponds to the sample variance .",
    "the two curves cross at around @xmath73 , but the data are scanty for class iii and this crossover is yet to be examined with a larger data set .",
    "we see that the gap between the two curves widens for @xmath74 , which is likely to account for the gap between the two branches in the gs83 sample as we saw earlier , and as also noted by @xcite .",
    "we indicate at the bottom right of the panels how reddening affects colour .",
    "the length of the arrow corresponds to @xmath75 , and the extinction curve we used @xcite gives @xmath76 : @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we give in table [ tab : star ] the effective temperature and colours for given spectral types for stars in the gs83 sample , where the use is made of our eq .",
    "( 1 ) to estimate the effective temperature or , where available , the temperature is adopted from the irfm measurements @xcite .",
    "we calculate the mean over the available stars , although for most listings only one or two stars are available in the gs83 sample .",
    "it is expected that colour is affected by metallicity .",
    "to show the range in @xmath25 vs. @xmath0 colour space that is covered by the variation of metallicity , we indicate it in figure [ fig:8](b ) with line segments where the two edges correspond to [ fe / h]=+0.5 ( upper edge ) and @xmath111 ( lower edge ) for luminosity class v , taking the atmosphere model of @xcite in this figure due to the inclusion of h@xmath80o opacities and the revision of tio lines . ] .",
    "the asterisk on the segment shows the position of [ fe / h]=+0 .",
    "these line segments are shifted for luminosity class iii stars , somewhat irregularly for k and m stars .",
    "we expect that the kurucz atmosphere models may give the relative metallicity - dependent position with reasonable accuracy , though the absolute position may somewhat be shifted .",
    "the models properly represent the range covered by the variation of metallicity .",
    "this shows that the width of the distribution of stars in the general catalogue is consistent with the variation covered by the range of metallicity @xmath81[fe / h]@xmath82 along with further widening of the range due to the mixture of luminosity class iii and v stars .",
    "a similar figure is given for the @xmath15 vs. @xmath0 colour distribution in figure [ fig:9 ] .",
    "the splitting of tracks between luminosity classes iii and v is very small : the two curves are nearly degenerate except for red stars with @xmath83 .",
    "the variation due to metallicity is also reduced although it is still substantial in @xmath0 .",
    "this generally smaller variation makes the discrepancy between the observation and the kurucz atmosphere model , indicated by line segments in figure [ fig:9]b , somewhat more apparent .",
    "the kurucz atmosphere model fits the curve representing the data only at its lowest metallicity edge , although the discrepancy is only about 0.03 mag in @xmath15 .",
    "the trend is similar for the @xmath45 vs. @xmath0 colour distribution ( figure [ fig:10 ] ) .",
    "we see a small gap appearing between the two luminosity classes which is somewhat more conspicuous than is seen in @xmath15 vs. @xmath0 .",
    "metallicity induced colour variation is larger for @xmath45 , even larger than for @xmath25 , for red stars .",
    "all of the above indicates that the sdss system is relatively close to a true ab system ; the suspected corrections to an ab system of a few hundredths of a magnitude @xcite are small enough not to have been seen in this analysis .",
    "to give the idea as to the feature of sdss colours .",
    "we show in figure [ fig:11 ] the distribution of white dwarfs , the sample of which is taken from the 9300 spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs ( @xmath84 ) of @xcite .",
    "they are white dwarfs with temperature typically @xmath85k .",
    "cooler white dwarfs are degenerate with main sequence stars , and more with subdwarfs .",
    "selections other than colours are needed to find candidates for cooler white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the locus of quasars is also added ( solid curve ) taking the composite spectrum of @xcite as the fiducial and by redshifting it to @xmath86 .",
    "the lowest redshifts shown depend on colour : they are 0 for @xmath25 , 0.05 for @xmath0 , and 0.35 for @xmath15 .",
    "the locus of type ia supernovae at the epoch of their b - band brightness maximum is also shown ( dashed curve ) using the model spectrum of salt2 @xcite that is moved to non - zero redshift , @xmath87 .",
    "some parts of the locii lie outside the frame of the figure .",
    "the figure shows the distribution of white dwarfs well separated from normal stars due to their uv excess in the @xmath25 vs. @xmath0 plane , in so far as hot white dwarfs ( approximately with @xmath88k ) are concerned , as efficiently used in @xcite , and to some extent also in the @xmath45 vs. @xmath0 plane .",
    "a strong degeneracy with normal stars is seen in the @xmath15 vs. @xmath0 plane .",
    "white dwarfs are degenerate with the blue tip of the distribution of normal stars with these colours .",
    "low redshift quasars , having @xmath25 colors much bluer than most stars , are also well separated from normal stars on the @xmath25 vs. @xmath0 plane till quasars reach @xmath89 , where they mingle into the stellar locus .",
    "the confusion of quasars with white dwarfs may take place in the @xmath25 vs. @xmath0 plane , though quasars are somewhat redder in @xmath0 : this degeneracy is lifted if the @xmath45 vs. @xmath0 colour is used in addition .",
    "this demonstrates the advantage of multicolour space in the photometric selection of low redshift quasar candidates . the photometric target selection for quasars",
    "is discussed at length in the papers of @xcite and @xcite , and we do not discuss this problem further .",
    "the figure shows that type ia supernovae can be identified , well separated from the stellar locus , given the homogeneity of colours of type ia supernovae .",
    "the fiducial colour of the salt ii template at zero redshift , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , is compared with that derived from the sdss supernova sample , which reads @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 where the error represents the sample variance @xcite .",
    "the diagram shows that type ia supernova locus moves monotonically with redshift , indicating that the photometric redshift can be estimated with a good confidence , given good colors at maximum light .",
    "the three panels of figure [ fig:12 ] show colours of morphologically classified galaxies at @xmath96 .",
    "galaxy colours are taken from @xcite based on the visual classification of 2250 galaxies with @xmath97 in the northern equatorial stripe .",
    "magnitudes are petrosian .",
    "the error bars indicate the variance of the samples for e , s0 , sa , sb , sc and i m .",
    "galaxies occupy a colour space locus narrower than stars , with colours roughly corresponding to f5@xmath11k2 stars in the range @xmath98 .",
    "the brightness of the sun is taken as a basic unit in astrophysical work .",
    "the measurement of the brightness of the sun , however , is notoriously difficult due to its extreme brightness and angular extent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the measured broad band colour of the sun has been variously reported from @xmath99 to 0.68 by various investigators .",
    "the choice often taken is @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "we adopt the absolute spectrophotometry of the sun measured by solspec in the _ atmospheric laboratory for application and science _",
    "( atlas ) 3 mission @xcite , the absolute flux of which has been calibrated against a black body standard .",
    "we present in table [ tab : solar ] the synthetic broad band magnitudes of the sun for @xmath101 , @xmath1 , @xmath54 , @xmath25 , @xmath0 , @xmath15 and @xmath45 .",
    "we take the @xmath71 and @xmath101 response functions evaluated by @xcite , which seem to give the minimal offset of synthetic brightness against johnson broad band photometry among a number of response functions we tested @xcite .",
    "we also present synthetic values of brightness of the sun using another spectrophotometric table compiled by @xcite in order to indicate the size of possible systematic errors .",
    "the agreement among the different spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is within about 0.02 mag for the v band brightness .",
    "the sed of @xcite integrated with the reference response function of the sdss 2.5 m telescope with 1.3 airmasses , gives @xmath102 mag which agrees well with @xmath103 mag of the summary value of photometry , given by @xcite and is also close to the value , @xmath104 , adopted in allen s _ astrophysical quantities _",
    "the use of the sed from earlier missions of atlas also gives v band brightness within 0.02 mag of the atlas3 value .",
    "this is , in fact , the order of magnitude @xcite claimed as the error of calibration .",
    "this result leads us to expect that solar sed can also be used to calculate broad band colours .",
    "the @xmath1 colour from @xcite is @xmath105 . while this looks somewhat bluer than the conventional value , we should remark that @xmath1 colour estimated from the colour temperature relations for main sequence stars with the solar abundance also lie bluer , in the range 0.616@xmath110.635 ( see *",
    "the colour often quoted , @xmath106 , is rather close to colour of g4 stars than g2 , and is suspected to be too red .",
    "the modern sed of the sun gives a reasonable agreement among the different data sets for both absolute flux and colour .",
    "we calculate with a reasonable confidence @xmath0 , @xmath25 , @xmath15 and @xmath45 colour of the sun as given in table [ tab : solar ] in the ab@xmath7 magnitude system .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath0 colours thus obtained ( see the cross symbols in figure [ fig:8 ] ) fall close to the later - type edge of the 1 @xmath20 ellipse representing g0@xmath11g2 stars of the gs83 sample in figure [ fig:8 ] : @xmath107 and @xmath108 are close to the mean of two g2v stars in the gs83 sample , 1.22 and 0.43 , respectively .",
    "the same is true also for the redder passbands : @xmath109 and @xmath110 are compared with 0.12 and 0.03 of the gs83 stars .",
    "the sun thus matches very well with g2 stars .",
    "the brightness in the @xmath54 passband is @xmath111 .",
    "our @xmath101 and @xmath54 magnitudes translate to absolute brightness @xmath112 and @xmath113 taking the distance modulus @xmath1131.57 . for other colours , see table 2 .",
    "we have studied photometric properties of stars given in the data archive of the sdss , the primary question being whether the photometric calibration was , overall , properly done .",
    "we found that , over the entire lifetime of the survey , the photometric calibration for point sources has been made tightly against the sdss standard stars and colours of the stars are well defined .",
    "we have not identified a sample of stars which are significantly and systematically deviant from the sdss standard stars .",
    "we have also found that the synthesised colour from the gunn stryker spectrophotometric sample represents very well the colour of stars in the sdss general catalogue and vice versa .",
    "photometric properties are perfectly consistent mutually with each other among the three samples we studied .",
    "it is also gratifying that the the synthesis of the sdss spectrophotometric data with the use of the reference response function of the 2.5 m telescope of the sdss give broad band fluxes that agree with broad band photometry of sdss with little tilt along colours .",
    "we have also given the fiducial colours and temperatures for stars empirically given spectral types , and show how metallicity and surface gravity affect colours .",
    "this enables us to infer spectral type of stars when sdss colours is given .",
    "we show that @xmath0 colour can be used as a good estimator of the effective temperature of stars .",
    "the distribution of stars in colour space matches well with what we expect from the variations of metallicity and surface gravity .",
    "we also present the brightness and colour of the sun with synthetic calculations , which shows that colour of the sun matches well with g2v stars in the sdss photometric system .",
    "a problem we encountered in the present study is that the sample of stars with well known temperature and metallicity is still too scanty , and bright stars that have sdss photometry are small in number .",
    "this is especially depressing when we require these two quantities at the same time .",
    "there is a pressing need to acquire photometry with the sdss passbands for bright star samples which have good measured atmospheric parameters , ( composition , temperature , and gravity ) to connect more tightly sdss photometry with physical stellar parameters .",
    "we are grateful to maki sekiguchi and takashi ichikawa for their collaboration in our earlier work to define the ab system using the solar spectroscopic data ( sect .",
    "5 ) , and masayuki tanaka for his work measuring the response functions of the sdss imager",
