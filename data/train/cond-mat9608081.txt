    "the experimental study of tunneling through zero - dimensional states in quantum dots with high charging energies has received recently considerable interest @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies cover the classical regime ( high temperatures ) @xcite as well as the quantum - mechanical regime ( low temperatures ) @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "coulomb blockade and resonant - tunneling phenomena together with nonequilibrium generalizations of the kondo effect are expected to occur .",
    "this leads to zero - bias anomalies in the differential conductance , which recently have been observed by ralph & buhrman @xcite . in this article",
    ", we present a new real - time diagrammatic approach to describe resonant tunneling at low temperatures and compare our results to the latter experiment .",
    "the experiments for coulomb blockade phenomena in zero - dimensional systems are usually performed in double - barrier resonant - tunneling structures @xcite , split - gate quantum - dot devices @xcite , quantum point - contacts with single - charge trap states @xcite and quite recently also in ultrasmall metallic tunnel junctions @xcite with al particles of diameter below @xmath1 . in the latter experiment ,",
    "the level spacing is of order @xmath2 which is comparable to the coulomb charging energy in usual quantum dots .",
    "therefore , the quantum dot is described by the nonequilibrium anderson model where the energy level @xmath3 ( with spin label @xmath4 ) is coupled via tunneling barriers to two electron reservoirs with different electrochemical potentials @xmath5 and @xmath6 . the charging energy is described by a strong on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath7 which suppresses double occupancy of the dot level . in equilibrium , it is well known from the theory of strongly correlated fermions @xcite that the spectral density of the dot can exhibit a kondo resonance at the fermi level .",
    "it occurs for a low lying level @xmath8 and weak zeeman splitting @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the level width in the noninteracting case , and provided that temperature is lower than the kondo temperature @xcite @xmath11}$ ] . since the weight of the equilibrium spectral density at the fermi level is proportional to the linear conductance , an enhancement of the latter due to kondo - assisted tunneling was predicted @xcite .",
    "typical values for quantum dots are @xmath12 and @xmath13 which , for @xmath14 , yield a kondo temperature of the order @xmath15 . due to",
    "heating effects such temperatures are still hard to realize in realistic dots .",
    "a more pronounced feature was found for the nonlinear conductance which shows a zero - bias maximum even for temperatures above the kondo temperature @xcite . at zero magnetic field",
    "the spectral density of each spin channel exhibits a kondo resonance at each of the chemical potentials .",
    "an applied magnetic field causes the kondo peaks to shift from the chemical potential by the zeeman energy , in opposite directions for the different spin channels . as a consequence ,",
    "kondo - assisted tunneling can only occur if the bias voltage exceeds the zeeman energy .",
    "therefore , the zero - bias anomaly is split by an applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "these features have been observed experimentally by ralph & buhrman @xcite .",
    "they measured the differential conductance through single - charge traps in a metallic quantum point - contact .",
    "although this system does not allow a controlled variation of the level position , the appearance of a zero - bias maximum with a peak height varying logarithmically with temperature clearly demonstrates the mechanism of kondo - assisted tunneling .",
    "however , the detailed comparison of the line shape in the experiment and the existing theory showed significant deviations .    in this paper , we will describe a new approach to calculate nonequilibrium properties of strongly correlated mesoscopic systems coupled to fermionic or bosonic baths via particle and energy exchange .",
    "it consists in a real - time diagrammatic approach closely related to path - integral methods formulated in connection with dissipation @xcite or tunneling in metallic junctions @xcite .",
    "one of the difficulties of the present problem lies in the fact that we have to account for the coulomb interaction in a nonperturbative way .",
    "therefore , the standard many - body diagrammatic approaches are not sufficient ( since wick s theorem can not be applied naively ) .",
    "we circumvent the problem by keeping track explicitly of the time evolution of the density matrix of the dot and tracing out only the bath degrees of freedom , which are assumed to be in equilibrium .",
    "the final diagrammatic language is set up by an expansion in the coupling to the fermionic reservoirs whereas the strong correlations on the local system are exactly taken into account .",
    "the basic step is the calculation of transition and current rates between different states of the dot .",
    "we present an exact expression for these rates as the sum over all irreducible diagrams .",
    "the transition rate is used to set up a formally exact master equation from which the time - dependent probability distribution for the dot can be calculated .",
    "the current rate is generally not identical to the transition rate since it contains also the number of particles transferred to the reservoir where the current is calculated .",
    "this number can take arbitrary values if one considers all higher order processes .",
    "the occupation probabilities multiplied with the current rates are used to calculate the current flowing through the system . in earlier publications",
    ", we have presented this technique in connection with tunneling through a metallic island with a continuum of states @xcite and demonstrated the equivalence to path - integral methods @xcite .",
    "there we used an approximation for the rate to sum up `` inelastic resonant tunneling '' processes to arbitrary order where different electrons tunnel coherently back and forth between the island and the reservoirs . here , we apply an equivalent approximation to describe resonant tunneling between metallic leads through an ultrasmall quantum dot with a single level .",
    "an important advantage of our approach is that we can solve the noninteracting limit exactly and can control systematically if this limit is contained within a given approximation for the correlated case .",
    "the theory is current conserving and can be used for the calculation of correlation functions or green s functions as well .    for",
    "the case where the dot level is @xmath16-fold degenerate we recover for @xmath17 and a low lying dot level a kondo peak in the spectral function .",
    "an applied transport voltage leads to a splitting of the kondo peak ( at @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the lead ) , which results in a zero - bias anomaly in the differential conductance , such that the conductance has a maximum at @xmath20 . on the other hand , if the dot level lies above the fermi levels of the leads @xmath18 we predict @xcite a zero - bias anomaly in the conductance which has a minimum at @xmath20 .    several extensions will be considered .",
    "we study the case where the ( spin- ) degeneracy of the dot level is lifted , e.g. , by an applied magnetic field . in this case",
    "the kondo peaks of both spin channels move apart from each other by the level spacing @xmath21 , and kondo - assisted tunneling sets in only at transport voltages @xmath22 exceeding this splitting .",
    "the calculated conductance agrees well with the experimental results of ref .  .",
    "we , furthermore , account for inelastic interactions with bosonic modes coupled to the dot .",
    "they describe applied time - dependent fields , interaction with phonons , or the fluctuations in the electrodynamic environment .",
    "the investigation of this field has started only recently in connection with transport through interacting quantum dots .",
    "the classical regime ( @xmath23 ) has been analyzed for time - dependent fields @xcite and bosonic environments @xcite .",
    "photon- and boson - assisted tunneling leads here to resonant side peaks in the coulomb oscillations which can be used to analyze the complete excitation spectrum of the dot .",
    "the results agree well with experiments @xcite . in the kondo regime",
    "it has been found @xcite that time - dependent perturbations split the kondo resonances which leads to satellite anomalies in the differential conductance and offers the possibility to realize pump effects which are purely based on the presence of kondo resonances .",
    "the linear ac - conductance has been analyzed in ref .  .",
    "in this paper , we will investigate the influence of an external bosonic field on transport phenomena through ultrasmall quantum dots at low temperatures and small boson frequencies ( compared to @xmath24 ) .",
    "the emission and absorption of bosons causes additional kondo singularities , for a one - mode field at @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "again , these resonances lead to corresponding anomalies in the differential conductance , which are inverted if the level position of the dot is moved through the fermi energy .",
    "we concentrate here on a dot containing only one energy level @xmath27 with degeneracy @xmath16 . in a magnetic field , due to",
    "the zeeman energy the level position is spin dependent .",
    "the dot is connected via high tunneling barriers to two large noninteracting reservoirs and coupled capacitively to an external gate voltage .",
    "the model hamiltonian of this `` single - electron transistor '' ( see fig .  [ fig.transistor ] ) is @xmath28 here , @xmath29 is the hamiltonian for the dot .",
    "it includes the coulomb interaction of the dot electrons , which is described within the capacitance model of a single - electron transistor by the capacitances @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the left and right tunnel junction and @xmath32 for the gate .",
    "furthermore , the dot electrons are coupled to bosonic modes @xmath33 with electron - boson coupling @xmath34 .",
    "thus , @xmath29 reads @xmath35 ( throughout this work , we set @xmath36 and use the convention @xmath37 . ) the particle number on the dot with spin @xmath4 is @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "the scale of the charging energy is provided by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the total capacitance of the system . the transistor can be tuned by the gate voltage @xmath42 via @xmath43 .",
    "we remark here , that @xmath44 is invariant under a global shift of all energies .",
    "therefore , we can always choose symmetric bias , @xmath45 .    the next term in eq .",
    "( [ hh ] ) , @xmath46 , describes the reservoir @xmath19 of noninteracting electrons in the leads .",
    "finally , the dot is coupled via tunnel barriers to the left and right lead .",
    "this coupling is described by the tunnel hamiltonian @xmath47    the bosonic modes can represent interaction with phonons @xcite or fluctuations of the electrodynamic environment @xcite very similar to the caldeira - leggett model@xcite . for our theory no assumption is needed for the specific kind of the modes @xmath33 and the couplings @xmath34 . in this way we are able to present a general result for the current which shows the influence of inelastic interactions for an arbitrary environment .",
    "the capacitive model is equivalent to the anderson hamiltonian , which we obtain by defining the interaction @xmath48 and shifting the level position @xmath49 .",
    "the asymmetry factor @xmath50 accounts for a different capacitive coupling of the left and right lead .",
    "we see here , that the effective level position in the anderson model depends on the gate voltage , as well as , due to @xmath51 , on the transport voltage .",
    "the dot is then described by @xmath52    an unitary transformation @xcite with @xmath53 and @xmath54 yields @xmath55 , where @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 the electron - boson interaction renormalizes the level position and the coulomb repulsion , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and the tunneling term acquires phase factors @xmath61 .    for strong coulomb repulsion",
    "@xmath7 we restrict ourselves to states with @xmath62 .",
