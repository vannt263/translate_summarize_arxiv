    "a twist grain boundary ( @xmath5 ) state that appears as an intermediate state at the cholesteric ( @xmath1 ) - smectic ( @xmath6 ) phase transition in chiral thermotropic liquid crystals was predicted theoretically by renn and lubensky @xcite in 1988 and then , one year later , was independently observed experimentally @xcite . since that time",
    "a wealth of properties of this new state were discovered in a number of experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite investigations .",
    "the results of these studies and the results of the present paper are summarized in the phase diagram of fig . 1 where the parameters @xmath7 ( whose meanings will be explained in sect .",
    "ii ) are controlled by the following experimental conditions : temperature , concentration , pressure etc .",
    "the reason for such a variety of intermediate phases is that , the direct @xmath1-@xmath6 transition can not occur in a continuous way since the cholesteric twist of the director , @xmath8 , is incompatible with the smectic layered structure .",
    "the last one in chiral liquid crystals is known to be of either @xmath9 or @xmath10 type : in @xmath11 the director @xmath12 is parallel to the layers modulation vector @xmath13 whereas in @xmath10 it is tilted with respect to @xmath13 by a constant angle @xmath14 and forms a conical precession along the normal to layers .",
    "therefore , the transition occurs either by the first order untwisting of @xmath15 or via formation of intermediate @xmath5 phases .",
    "the actual sequence of the intermediate phases depends on the final @xmath6 state that occurs at low temperature .",
    "there is only one intermediate phase ( @xmath3 ) when the transition goes to @xmath11 @xcite and a series of phases when the transition goes to @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the general structure of the @xmath5 state is shown in fig .",
    "the compromise between the cholesteric twist of @xmath15 and layered structure of @xmath16 is achieved by formation of a set of rotated smectic slabs ( blocks ) , normal to those being follow the pitch @xmath17 .",
    "the slabs are separated by grain boundaries consisting of a series of equally spaced screw dislocations that provide the junction of the layers in adjusting slabs .",
    "the slab width @xmath18 , dislocation spacing @xmath19 , director pitch @xmath20 , and layer spacing @xmath21 are related by the following topological constraint @xcite :    @xmath22    coupling of the director with the modulation vector @xmath13 results in the unbending of @xmath15 close to the block center .",
    "when temperature decreases the director pitch and slab width diverge with further untwisting of @xmath23 . finally , they tend to infinity corresponding to the transition to the @xmath6 state .",
    "the variety of @xmath5 phases in fig.1 is provided by the different internal structure of @xmath5 blocks that are shown in fig.2b - e .",
    "generally , @xmath5 blocks are reminiscent of the final @xmath6 state that occurs at low temperature .",
    "therefore , the @xmath3 block is just the @xmath11 slab , shown in fig .",
    "2b , confined by grain boundaries , the layers modulation vector @xmath13 being parallel to the director @xmath12 in the slab center @xcite .",
    "similarly , the @xmath24 slab is provided by smectic layers that are inclined to @xmath12 by the angle @xmath25 .",
    "the inclination , however , can be done in other ways : when tilted layers are either parallel to the pith axis @xmath26 as in fig .",
    "2b , or tilted to it as in fig.2c .",
    "we call these phases @xmath27 and @xmath2",
    ". the blocks of the @xmath28 and @xmath2 phases actually have the structure of slabs of differently oriented @xmath29 , as distinguished from its chiral analog @xmath10 by the absence of the director precession . under certain conditions",
    "a transition @xmath30 occurs inside the @xmath24 slabs @xcite .",
    "the corresponding @xmath31 phase that appears close to the bulk @xmath10 phase ( see fig",
    ". 1 ) will be not considered in this paper .",
    "originally the @xmath27 phase was assumed to be an intermediate @xmath5 state at the @xmath1-@xmath10 transition @xcite ( there it was called @xmath32 ) . however",
    ", x - ray experiments @xcite and theoretical estimations @xcite demonstrate that the @xmath2 phase is indeed more stable . in @xcite",
    "this phase was called as the melted grain boundary ( @xmath33 ) phase to stress that the smectic order parameter vanishes at grain boundaries because of the small distance between screw dislocations .",
    "we prefer , however , to use the @xmath2 notation to emphasize the geometrical structure of this phase .    in this paper",
    "we revise the calculation of @xcite for the _ upper critical temperature _",
    "@xmath0 ( @xmath34-@xmath35-@xmath36-@xmath37 line in fig . 1 for the @xmath1-@xmath24 transition , taking into account the recent proof of the stability of the @xmath2 phase @xcite that was not considered in @xcite .",
    "we confirm and expand the estimation of @xcite to the whole region of parameters .",
    "in addition we calculate the principal parameters of the @xmath2 phase : upper critical temperature , slab width @xmath18 and the x - ray diffraction pattern that can be measured experimentally .",
    "several features that modify the phase diagram calculated in @xcite follow from our analysis .",
    "the @xmath3 phase that was shown in @xcite to be stable when the transition is to the @xmath11 phase , penetrates also into the @xmath10 region as a narrow stripe in between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 phases , and finishes in the tetracritical point @xmath35 far inside this region .",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath2 transition is split either by this @xmath3 stripe or by the narrow region of the new @xmath4 phase .",
    "the @xmath4 slab is superposed from two equivalent @xmath29 populations with left and right layers inclined to the pitch axis as shown in fig .",
    "this new phase can be viewed as a kind of standing density wave quantized by the grain boundaries . in reality",
    "it can be observed in between the @xmath1-@xmath3-@xmath2-@xmath4 tetracritical point @xmath35 and the point @xmath36 .",
    "location of these points is calculated in this paper .",
    "the upper critical temperature @xmath0 should have a kink at @xmath35 . under certain conditions",
    "the enhancement ( oscillation ) of @xmath0 between @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be observed .",
    "a remarkable feature of the @xmath3 phase was noted in @xcite to be an analogy with the abrikosov vortex state in superconductors in a magnetic field .",
    "this completed an analogy between the superconducting transition in metals and the phase transition between nematic ( @xmath38 and @xmath11 phases in liquid crystals , first pointed by de gennes @xcite . in the present article",
    "we show that the @xmath2 phase is the analog of the mixed state in superconductors with a space - modulated order parameter ( like larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrel phases @xcite ) , providing that modulation is perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "another interesting analogy we discuss is the similarity between the @xmath3-@xmath2 transition and the transition between the symmetry differing phases in an  unconventional ",
    "superconductor @xmath39 in the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "on a quantitative level , the appearance of @xmath5 state is described by the chen - lubensky ( cl ) model @xcite , which is known to be a quite general approach in explaining various phase transitions between cholesteric ( nematic ) phases and modulated smectic phases . in this model",
    "the cholesteric and smectic phases are described by two coupled order parameters : by the twisted director @xmath40 and the space modulated complex function @xmath41 , where the modulation of the smectic density is given by the real part of @xmath42 .",
    "the resulting energy consists of two parts :    @xmath43    where the elastic frank energy :    @xmath44    provides the twisted texture of the director . in the cholesteric phase @xmath45 .",
    "the chirality is provided by the parameter @xmath46 .",
    "when @xmath47 , expression ( [ ff ] ) reduces to the elastic energy of the nematic phase with @xmath48 .",
    "the smectic state is described by the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) functional @xmath49 , which has a finite-@xmath50 instability for the order parameter @xmath41 provided by a gauge derivative @xmath51 :    @xmath52    we take the quartic in the gradient term in the isotropic form @xmath53 which is slightly different from the original cl model where this term was written as : @xmath54 .",
    "this does not change the final results but simplifies the calculations .",
    "now we give a brief review of the properties of the cl model .",
    "in the nonchiral case ( when @xmath47 ) , a second order phase transition from nematic to smectic phases takes place @xcite .",
    "the type of the smectic phase depends on the sign of @xmath55 ( terms with @xmath56 and @xmath57 are assumed to be positive ) .",
    "when @xmath58 , a transition to the @xmath11 phase with the order parameter @xmath59 occurs at @xmath60 . when @xmath61 an additional transversal to @xmath12 modulation occurs , resulting in a @xmath29 order parameter @xmath62 with @xmath63",
    "this modulation is stabilized by the quartic gradient term at wave vector @xmath64 @xmath65 which gives the layers inclination angle as @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath67-@xmath29 transition occurs at @xmath68 .    in a chiral case @xcite ( when @xmath69 ) , the situation is more complicated since the gauge derivatives and anisotropic coefficients in the gradient terms in eq.([fpsi ] ) depend on the direction of @xmath12 which is not uniform in a space",
    "this provides a coupling of the order parameters @xmath70 and @xmath42 leading to an untwisting of @xmath71 when the smectic layers are formed .",
    "such a process occurs either directly , by the first order transition , or via the intermediate @xmath5 state . in both cases",
    "the final smectic phases are again either @xmath11 or @xmath29 .",
    "the scenario of the phase transition depends on the parameters of the cl model .",
    "we formulate those conditions below .",
    "when the direct @xmath1-@xmath72 transition takes place , the critical temperatures are calculated by comparison of the energies of the @xmath1 and @xmath16 phases @xcite . the @xmath73-@xmath11-@xmath10 tricritical point in the @xmath74 plane",
    "was found to be : @xmath75 the transition lines are given by :    @xmath76    when the transition occurs via an intermediate @xmath5 state , the critical temperatures and the detailed structure of the @xmath5 state are provided by a nonuniform solution of the gl equation obtained from ( [ fpsi ] ) :    @xmath77    where , @xmath78 .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in the structure of the @xmath5 state just below the @xmath1-@xmath5 phase transition that takes place at _ the upper critical temperature _ @xmath0 .",
    "we consider the case when @xmath61 , that is when the system has a tendency to form the @xmath10 phase at low temperature . in the following subsection",
    "we derive the basic equations that describe this transition .",
    "the order parameter in the @xmath5 state below @xmath0 is given by a periodic superposition of rotating blocks equally shifted by a distance @xmath18    @xmath79    the component of the modulation vector transverse to the pitch @xmath80 , follows the director twist : @xmath81 with phase advance ( retardation ) @xmath82 factors @xmath83 are the degenerate phason degrees of freedom @xcite .    the _ block profile function _",
    "@xmath84 is localized within the block width @xmath85 and , together with the phase @xmath86 , provides the structure of the @xmath87 slab . in the @xmath3 phase @xmath88 and @xmath84",
    "is a centered bell - shape function ( which has a gaussian profile @xmath89 at @xmath90 ) . the structure of the @xmath27 slab ( fig .",
    "2c ) is given by a centered bell - shape function @xmath91 and nonzero advancing ( retarding ) phase angle @xmath92 @xcite that results in the tilting of the layers parallel to the pitch axis .",
    "in the @xmath2 phase the angle @xmath86 is equal to zero and @xmath84 is modulated in the @xmath93 direction as @xmath94 .",
    "this corresponds to the right ( left ) transverse inclination of the layers as shown in fig .",
    "the profile function @xmath84 of the slab , located at the origin , and phase @xmath95 are found by solving of eq.([gl ] ) with the substitution @xmath96 .",
    "several simplifications are used in renn - lubensky theory .",
    "usually the block width @xmath18 is much smaller than the cholesteric pitch @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , on the scale of @xmath18 the twist of @xmath15 is minimal and approximately is written as @xmath98 .",
    "next , just below @xmath99 the amplitude of @xmath84 is small and only the terms linear in @xmath84 are relevant in eq.([gl ] ) .",
    "the corresponding linearized equation for @xmath100 and @xmath86 is :    @xmath101    @xmath102    this equation has a set of localized eigenstates @xmath103 with a discrete spectrum of _ eigentemperatures _ @xmath104 .",
    "the upper critical temperature @xmath0 of the @xmath1-@xmath5 transition is provided by the maximal value of @xmath104 .",
    "the block profile function is given by the corresponding eigenfunction @xmath105 .",
    "we assume further that @xmath88 , that is , the parallel layers inclination according to @xcite does not occur",
    ". the justification of this approximation will be presented in sect .",
    "it is convenient to use the dimensionless units :    @xmath106    we discuss first the values of parameters @xmath107,@xmath108,@xmath109 .",
    "parameter @xmath107 has a sense of the power of the cholesteric twist .",
    "usually in chiral liquid crystals the interlayer smectic spacing is much smaller than cholesteric pitch having @xmath110 .",
    "the small tilting angle @xmath111 results in @xmath112 .",
    "in contrast , parameter @xmath113 , which is related to the ratio of the layer compression elastic constant @xmath114 to the layer curvature energy @xmath115 , is larger than one @xcite and therefore is much large than @xmath108 .    neglecting @xmath55 in comparison with @xmath56 in the last term of eq.([lin ] ) , we rewrite it in dimensionless units as :    @xmath116    @xmath117    the order parameter @xmath118 of the @xmath5 state is reproduced by substitution of corresponding eigenfunction @xmath84 into ( [ struct ] ) .",
    "then , one can calculate the free energy @xmath119 ( [ struct ] ) of the @xmath5 state as a function of the slab width @xmath18 or , more conveniently , as a function of the geometrical factor @xmath120 .",
    "the actual value of this ratio is found by minimization of @xmath119 with respect to @xmath120 .",
    "it was found @xcite that @xmath120 @xmath121 when @xmath122 and the @xmath3 phase has a gaussian profile in the slab .",
    "the factor @xmath123 depends the relative strengths of cholesteric splay ( bend ) and the twist elastic energies @xmath124 .",
    "it varies from @xmath125 when @xmath126 ( the calculation in this case is reduced to minimizating the abrikosov factor @xmath127 ) , to @xmath128 when @xmath129 is large .",
    "we will use this result to evaluate @xmath120 in the @xmath130 phases when @xmath131 .",
    "in this section we calculate the eigenstates of eq.(@xmath132 ) that correspond to the upper critical temperature @xmath133 , and discuss the block structure just below @xmath133 for the different types of @xmath5 state at @xmath134 .",
    "note that eigentemperatures @xmath135 ( including @xmath133 ) and eigenfunctions @xmath136 are generally functions of @xmath107,@xmath108,@xmath113 . because of the scaling properties resulting from eq.(@xmath132 ) :    @xmath137    parameter @xmath108 can be excluded if one considers the dependence @xmath138 on the rescaled coordinates @xmath139 .    to proceede with the diagonalization of eq.(@xmath132 ) for @xmath140 , recall first the results of @xcite for the opposite case of @xmath141 when a transition occurs to the @xmath3 phase .",
    "when @xmath142 is large enough , the operator @xmath143 was shown @xcite to be truncatable to the more simple form of the harmonic oscillator @xmath144 the lowest eigenstate gives the gaussian profile @xmath145 of the @xmath3 block and the upper critical temperature @xmath146 .",
    "this result can be improved if one considers the residual part of @xmath147 as a perturbation :    @xmath148    the second term is smaller than the first one if @xmath149 , which is the condition of applicability of the approximation .",
    "the opposite case of @xmath150 will be discussed later .",
    "figure 3 shows the result of numerical diagonalization of ( @xmath132 ) for different @xmath113 when @xmath151 .",

    "note first the concurrence of two eigenstates with close eigentemperatures @xmath155 and @xmath156 that give the upper critical temperature @xmath157 .",
    "these levels often cross when @xmath107 changes , resulting in the oscillating behavior of @xmath158 .",
    "the oscillations of @xmath158 are strong at @xmath159 and more pronounced still at large values of @xmath113 .",
    "the appearance of these nearly degenerate eigenstates is related to two equivalent , right and left inclinations of layers in the @xmath2 slab .",
    "the corresponding block profile functions , @xmath160 and @xmath161 , however , can not be the eigenfunctions of eq.([lindim ] ) since they do not possess the definite parity with respect to the symmetry operation @xmath162 , which is a property of @xmath163 .",
    "the proper eigenstates @xmath164 with eigentemperatures @xmath165 are constructed as superpositions of both populations as @xmath166 @xmath167 that results in the @xmath4 phase just below @xmath168 the function @xmath169 has @xmath170- ( @xmath171- ) like oscillations and can be viewed as a standing wave between the grain boundaries .",
    "the effects of commensurability of this wave with block width @xmath18 stabilize either the even @xmath170-like or the odd @xmath171-like behavior as the lowest state to have a vanishing order parameter at the grain boundaries .",
    "the block width @xmath18 changes as a function of @xmath107 that alternates the order of the @xmath172eigenstates leading to the oscillations in @xmath158 .",
    "the tendency to @xmath29 slab formation at lower temperatures results in the further transition from the @xmath4 to @xmath2 phase determined by the lowest from @xmath173 critical temperatures renormalized by the nonlinear term @xmath174 in eq.([gl ] ) . below this second transition ,",
    "one of the populations starts to be suppressed and a block profile function is constructed now from both the @xmath175 and @xmath176 eigenstates to form the @xmath27 phase with either a @xmath177 or @xmath178 profile of the slab .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the @xmath1-@xmath2 transition is always split by the intermediate @xmath4 phase . at high @xmath107 the period of oscillations of @xmath179 becomes larger than its localization length , and the lowest eigenstate @xmath180 has the single - peak profile of the @xmath181 phase",
    ". the @xmath1-@xmath3-@xmath2-@xmath4 tetracritical point @xmath182 corresponds therefore to the highest in @xmath107 intersection of @xmath165 eigentemperatures . as follows from fig .",
    "3 , the appearance of the @xmath4 phase becomes practically invisible when @xmath107 decreases below the second intersection of @xmath165 at the point @xmath36 .",
    "we expect , therefore , that only the odd @xmath4 phase between @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be observed in reality .",
    "equation ( @xmath132 ) can be solved analytically in the two limit cases @xmath183 and @xmath184 , when the operator @xmath143 can be truncated to a more simple form .",

    "the corresponding eigentemperatures are given by the equation :    @xmath190    the oscillations of @xmath191 ( fig.3a ) are related to the quantum number @xmath192 of the lowest eigenstate that changes with @xmath107 , unlike what occurs in the harmonic oscillator where the @xmath193 eigenlevel is always the lowest one .",

    "the slab width is given by the width of the polynomial @xmath201 as :    @xmath202    the block profile function @xmath203 oscillates as @xmath204 with period @xmath205 @xmath206 .",

    "the parity of @xmath208 alternates with @xmath209 resulting in the different parity of @xmath210 and @xmath211eigenstates .",
