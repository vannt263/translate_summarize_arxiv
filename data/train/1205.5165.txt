    "in @xcite , the authors have posed the following problem : find a smooth bounded domain @xmath3 in a riemannian manifold @xmath4 with metric @xmath5 , such that the first eigenvalue @xmath6 of the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath3 has a corresponding real , positive eigenfunction @xmath7 satisfying @xmath8 on the boundary of @xmath3 . any such domain is called _ extremal _ because it provides a local minimum for the first eigenvalue @xmath6 of the laplace - beltrami operator , under the constraint of fixed total volume of @xmath3 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in special cases one can find a sequence of extremal domains @xmath9 with increasing volumes , such that the limit domain @xmath10 is unbounded , and its first eigenvalue vanishes as @xmath11 .",
    "this limit extremal domain is then called _ exceptional _ , and the corresponding limit function @xmath12 is a positive , harmonic function on @xmath3 which solves simultaneously the overdetermined boundary value problem with null dirichlet data and constant neumann data .",
    "the problem of finding exceptional domains in @xmath13 and their corresponding functions @xmath14 ( called  roof \" functions by the authors of @xcite ) is a nontrivial problem of potential theory .",
    "there is no obvious variational principle to use , on the one hand because @xmath3 is unbounded ( so the dirichlet energy of @xmath14 ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) will diverge ) , and , on the other hand , because the constant neumann data constraint is not conformally invariant .    in the absence of a suitable variational formulation",
    ", we may interpret the scaling @xmath11 described above as a dynamical process , in which the pair @xmath15 evolves so that the limit @xmath11 solves the overdetermined problem .",
    "in other words , we can turn this observation into a constructive method for finding ( building ) exceptional domains . in order to do this ,",
    "it is helpful to note that , upon compactification of the boundary @xmath16 ( with metric @xmath17 ) , the pair @xmath18 with flat metric becomes conformal to the half - cylinder @xmath19 , with metric @xmath20 under this reformulation , scaling of @xmath21 becomes equivalent to scaling of the metric structure given above , defined over the fixed space @xmath22 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the ricci flow , in which the metric structure @xmath5 evolves with respect to a deformation parameter @xmath23 according to the equation @xmath24 with the right side of the equation given by the covariant ricci tensor .",
    "it is known @xcite that for the case of a two - dimensional manifold , with metric given by @xmath25 , the ricci flow equations reduce to a single nonlinear equation @xmath26 ( since in two dimensions the riemann tensor has only one independent component ) .",
    "this is a heat equation with the generator given by the laplace - beltrami operator corresponding to the metric @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , if there is a stationary solution @xmath28 as @xmath11 , it will correspond to the scaling of the first eigenvalue @xmath29 and , by conformally mapping back @xmath22 using the solution @xmath30 , we will obtain the solution @xmath18 .",
    "in other words , we can summarize this constructive method for finding exceptional domains in @xmath31 as follows : starting from a 2-dimensional riemannian manifold with finite volume and metric encoded through the positive real function @xmath14 , and boundary set defined via @xmath32 , consider the time evolution given by the ricci flow , without volume renormalization .",
    "then @xcite the manifold will remain riemannian at all times , and in the @xmath11 limit the function @xmath14 will become a solution of the nonlinear laplace - beltrami equation . furthermore",
    ", if @xmath14 remains finite everywhere in the domain , then it is harmonic and satisfies both dirichlet and neumann conditions at all finite boundary components , so it is a solution for the overdetermined potential problem .",
    "considered together with the ( boundary ) point at infinity , the manifold is equivalent @xcite to a pseudosphere ( flat everywhere except at the infinity point , with overall positive curvature ) .",
    "( we wish to emphasize that there is no reason to assume that such constructive methods would be exhaustive . )",
    "thus , so motivated , it is natural to try to characterize exceptional domains in flat euclidean spaces .",
    "the authors in @xcite suggested that in two dimensions there are only three examples : a complement of a disk , a halfplane , and a nontrivial example obtained as the image of the strip @xmath33 under the mapping @xmath34 .",
    "they posed as an open problem to determine if these are the only examples ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7 ) .",
    "( they gave some evidence by characterizing the halfplane under a global assumption on the gradient of the roof function ( * ? ? ?",
    "they also posed the problem of finding nontrivial examples in higher dimensions and suggested the possibility of axially symmetric examples similar to the nontrivial example in the plane ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 2.1 ) .",
    "we address both of these problems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the theory of hardy spaces in order to address a subtlety that arises in connection with the regularity of the boundary of an exceptional domain .",
    "this leads us to assume in our theorems that the domain @xmath3 is smirnov . in section 3",
    ", we characterize exteriors of disks as being the only exceptional domain whose boundary is compact . in section 4 , we establish a connection between the  roof function  of an exceptional domain and the so - called _ schwarz function _ of its boundary , and we also show that the boundary of a simply connected exceptional domain @xmath3 can pass either ( i ) once or ( ii ) twice through infinity . in section 5 , we show that case ( i ) implies that @xmath3 is a halfplane . in section 6",

    "an analytic function @xmath36 is said to belong to the hardy class @xmath35 , @xmath37 , if the integrals : @xmath38 remain bounded as @xmath39 .",

    "5 ) ( also cf .",
    "@xcite ) provides the parametrization of functions in hardy classes by their zero sets , associated singular measures , and moduli of their boundary values .",
    "[ thm : factorization ] every function @xmath51 of class @xmath35 ( @xmath52 ) has a unique ( up to a unimodular constant factor ) factorization of the form @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a blaschke product , @xmath45 is a singular inner function , and @xmath55 is an outer function for the class @xmath35 .",
    "suppose @xmath3 is a jordan domain with rectifiable boundary and @xmath56 is a conformal map .",
    "then @xmath57 by theorem 3.12 in @xcite . by theorem [ thm : factorization ]",
    ", @xmath58 has a canonical factorization @xmath59 , and since @xmath60 is a conformal map @xmath58 does not vanish , so @xmath61 .",
    "then @xmath3 is called a _ smirnov domain _",
    "if @xmath62 so that @xmath63 is purely an outer function .",
    "this definition is independent of the choice of conformal map .",
    "there are examples of non - smirnov domains with , as above , @xmath61 , but now @xmath64 and the singular inner function @xmath45 is not constant .",
    "such examples were first constructed by m. keldysh and m. lavrentiev @xcite using complicated geometric arguments .",
    "their existence was somewhat demystified by an analytic proof provided by p. duren , h. s. shapiro , and a. l. shields @xcite . like the disk ,",
    "such a domain has harmonic measure at zero ( assuming @xmath65 ) proportional to arc - length .",
    "thus , its boundary is sometimes called a `` pseudocircle '' .    similarly , there are `` exterior pseudocircles '' , arising as the boundary of an unbounded non - smirnov domain @xcite for which the harmonic measure at infinity is proportional to arclength , and thus green s function with singularity at infinity provides a roof function that is a weak solution satisfying the boundary conditions almost everywhere .",
    "thus , this provides a pathological example of an exceptional domain in a weak sense . in order to construct such an unbounded non - smirnov domain ,",
    "let us follow the method in the above mentioned @xcite , which is presented in duren s book ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 10.4 ) .",
    "we recall that the construction is carried out by `` working backwards '' , first writing down a singular inner function @xmath45 as a candidate for the derivative @xmath66 of the conformal map @xmath51 .",
    "the difficulty is then to show that @xmath51 is not only analytic , but is also _ univalent _ so that it actually gives a conformal map from @xmath43 to some domain @xmath3 .",
    "univalence is established using a criterion of nehari which states that the following growth condition on the schwarzian derivative @xmath67 is sufficient for univalence : @xmath68    let us follow this procedure , indicating the step that needs to be modified .",
    "start with a measure @xmath69 , singular with respect to lebesgue measure on the circle , yet sufficiently smooth , so that it belongs to the zygmund class @xmath70 ( cf .",
    "* section 10.4 ) ) .",
    "we will also require @xmath71 to have the first moment zero , i.e. , @xmath72 this can always be acheived by symmetrizing @xmath71 around the origin and replacing @xmath71 by @xmath73 .",
    "then the center of mass is at the origin , which is ( [ eq : mu ] ) .",
    "as in @xcite , let @xmath55 be the schwarz integral of @xmath71    @xmath74    let @xmath75 be the exponential of a constant ( to be chosen later ) times @xmath76 , @xmath77 here is where we depart slightly from @xcite in order to get an unbounded domain as the image of @xmath51 . instead of taking @xmath75 as a candidate for @xmath66 , we take @xmath78 note that the residue of @xmath66 is zero ( from having made the first moment of @xmath71 zero ) so that its antiderivative @xmath51 is analytic in @xmath43 except for a simple pole at @xmath79 . also , @xmath80 a.e . on @xmath81 .",

    "thus , for a small enough choice of @xmath91 , @xmath67 satisfies the nehari criterion for univalence ( [ eq : nehari ] ) .    hence , @xmath51 is a conformal map mapping @xmath92 onto the complement of a jordan domain with rectifiable boundary . to see why the boundary is rectifiabile , note that , as stated in (",
    "* section 10.4 ) ) , @xmath93 , and so @xmath94 is in @xmath95 in an annulus @xmath96 .",
    "this seemingly excessive construction of an exterior pseudocircle can not be avoided by simply taking an inversion of an interior pseudocircle ; the result will be non - smirnov , but it will _ not _ be an exterior pseudocircle . nor can one simply take the complement . as p. jones and s. smirnov proved in @xcite ,",
    "the complement of a non - smirnov domain is often smirnov ! ( this unexpected resolution of a long standing problem put to rest all hopes to characterize the smirnov property in terms of a boundary curve . )",

    "his results confirm our conjecture for domains having finitely many boundary components and also show that the above infinite genus example is the only periodic exceptional domain for which the quotient by the period has finitely many boundary components .",
    "his methods use a remarkable nontrivial correspondence to minimal surfaces , perturbing an exceptional domain by harmonically mapping it to another domain in such a way that the graph of the new height function ( which pulls back to the roof function in the original domain ) satisfies the minimal surface equation .",
    "a miraculous ( and crucial to his approach ) by - product is that , whereas the graph of the roof function meets its boundary at a @xmath358-degree angle , the minimal graph meets its boundary vertically so that gluing it to its own reflection over the @xmath359-plane results in a smooth minimal surface ( without boundary ! ) embedded in @xmath360 .",
