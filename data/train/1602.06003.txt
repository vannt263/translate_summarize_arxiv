    "in previous work @xcite we have commented on the usefulness of a clifford algebra approach to reflection groups , and on the complementarity of these two approaches .",
    "this was mostly due to the uniquely simple prescription for performing reflections in clifford algebra , via a sandwiching procedure .",
    "the cartan - dieudonn theorem extends this to all orthogonal transformations by allowing to express them as products of reflections , and due to the homomorphism between @xmath1 and @xmath2 this in fact also extends to all conformal transformations .",
    "here we argue that the clifford framework is in fact the natural framework for root systems and reflection / coxeter groups . in order to perform a reflection in the vector space in question ,",
    "a metric is used to calculate the vector component parallel to the vector normal to the reflection hyperplane , which gets reversed under a reflection in that hyperplane .",
    "thus , one can always use this metric on the vector space to construct the corresponding clifford algebra .",
    "this setup then has the advantages of the approach above .",
    "the main route of interest in these structures is from a lie theoretic perspective .",
    "a continuous lie group , which is of interest for many local / gauge symmetry principles in high energy and gravitational physics as well as other areas , leads one to consider the lie algebra of infinitesimal transformations .",
    "these lie algebras usually have a triangular decomposition into the cartan subalgebra ( the quantum numbers ) and the positive and negative roots ( the creation and annihilation operators ) of a crystallographic root system ( which generates the weyl group of the root lattice ) on which the killing form always provides a metric .",
    "one can thus always use this killing form to construct the corresponding clifford algebra .",
    "we therefore point out that it is more economical to employ this clifford algebra structure ( which is implicit anyway ) , rather than simply using the vector space and inner product structures separately .    as an illustration of this method",
    ", we treat the example of the tetrahedral group associated with the root system @xmath0 .",
    "this is particularly interesting , as it does not contain the inversion , which has led to a lot of confusion in the literature .",
    "following the cartan - dieudonn versor approach , we will demonstrate concrete group theoretic calculations for all the different types of polyhedral groups ",
    "spinor , pinor , rotation and reflection  as groups of multivectors ( versors ) in the clifford algebra .    since the spinors in 3d have a 4d euclidean structure one gets as a by - product a remarkable result relating root systems in three and four dimensions : using a clifford spinor construction one can construct  starting from any root system in 3d  a 4d root system , which generates a corresponding 4d reflection group .",
    "the 4d root systems that arise in this way are precisely the exceptional root systems in four dimensions , and their unusual symmetries can also be easily understood only from the 3d spinorial point of view . these results and the clifford spinor construction do not appear to be known , and also present a more general context for the mckay correspondence .    via the homomorphism between @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "all conformal transformations can in fact also be generated via reflections in a space of signature @xmath3 , and the modular group , which is a subgroup of the 2d conformal group , can also be generated in this framework .",
    "we are interested in conformal field theory and string theory , in particular in relation to string theory on the torus , modularity and moonshine phenomena @xcite , and therefore present a cga construction of the 2d conformal and modular groups , which could have interesting novel applications .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ sec_cox ] introduces the framework of root systems , reflection and coxeter groups , as well as their graphical representation . in section [ sec_versor ] , we present the clifford algebra background , in particular a versor formalism for the cartan - dieudonn theorem , by which the full , chiral , binary and pinor polyhedral groups are all easily generated and treated within the same framework . in section [ sec_spin ] , we discuss the example of the root system of @xmath0 , restricting ourselves to the even subgroups ( spinors and rotations ) for simplicity , and show how one can perform group theoretical calculations in this way ; in particular , we discuss the conjugacy classes .",
    "the spinors in 3d have a 4d euclidean norm , which yields a remarkable theorem which induces from every 3d root system a 4d root system in a constructive way ( section [ sec_bin ] ) .",
    "we discuss this construction , the peculiar symmetries of the resulting root systems , and how this approach puts the mckay correspondence into a wider framework . in section [ sec_pin ] , we revisit the example of @xmath0 and treat the whole pinor and reflection groups in the versor formalism ",
    "@xmath0 is the most salient example in this regard . in section [ sec_cga ] ,",
    "we briefly outline how to extend the conformal geometric algebra treatment to the conformal and modular groups , which might have interesting new applications .",
    "we conclude with a summary and possible further work in section [ sec_concl ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce reflection groups via their generating root systems , which are sets of ( root ) vectors  i.e. they can be interpreted as polytopes . although perhaps unfamiliar , it is in fact a very simple concept , encapsulated in two straightforward axioms .    [ defrootsys ] a _ root system _ is a collection @xmath4 of non - zero vectors @xmath5 ( called root vectors ) spanning an @xmath6-dimensional euclidean vector space @xmath7 endowed with a positive definite bilinear form , which satisfies the two axioms :    1 .",
    "@xmath4 only contains a root @xmath5 and its negative , but no other scalar multiples : @xmath8 .",
    "2 .   @xmath4 is invariant under all reflections corresponding to root vectors in @xmath4 : @xmath9 , with the reflection @xmath10 in the hyperplane that @xmath5 is normal to given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the inner product on @xmath7 .    for a crystallographic root system , a subset @xmath13 of @xmath4 , called _ simple roots _",
    "@xmath14 , is sufficient to express every element of @xmath4 via @xmath15-linear combinations with coefficients of the same sign .",
    "@xmath4 is therefore completely characterised by this basis of simple roots . in the case of the non - crystallographic root systems",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the same holds for the extended integer ring @xmath19=\\lbrace a+\\tau b| a , b \\in \\mathbb{z}\\rbrace$ ] , where @xmath20 is the golden ratio @xmath21 . for the crystallographic root systems , the classification in terms of dynkin diagrams essentially follows the one familiar from lie groups and lie algebras , as their weyl groups are precisely the crystallographic coxeter groups .",
    "a mild generalisation to so - called coxeter - dynkin diagrams is necessary for the non - crystallographic root systems :    a graphical representation of the geometric content of a root system is given by _",
    "coxeter - dynkin diagrams _",
    ", where nodes correspond to simple roots , orthogonal roots are not connected , roots at @xmath22 have a simple link , and other angles @xmath23 have a link with a label @xmath24 .",
    "the _ cartan matrix _ of a set of simple roots @xmath25 is defined as the matrix @xmath26 .    for instance , the root system of the icosahedral group @xmath17 has one link labelled by @xmath27 ( via the above relation @xmath28 ) , as does its four - dimensional analogue @xmath18 , and the infinite two - dimensional family @xmath29 ( the root systems of the symmetry groups of the regular @xmath6-gons ) is labelled by @xmath6 .",
    "a host of examples of diagrams is presented in table [ tab:4 ] in section [ sec_bin ] .",
    "the reflections in the second axiom of the root system generate a reflection group .",
    "a coxeter group is a mathematical abstraction of the concept of a reflection as an involution ( squares to the identity ) as well as @xmath24-fold rotations ( two successive reflections generate a rotation in the plane defined by the two roots ) in terms of abstract generators .",
    "a _ coxeter group _ is a group generated by a set of involutive generators @xmath30 subject to relations of the form @xmath31 with @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "the finite coxeter groups have a geometric representation where the involutions are precisely realised as reflections at hyperplanes through the origin in a euclidean vector space @xmath7 , i.e. they are essentially just the classical reflection groups .",
    "in particular , then the abstract generator @xmath34 corresponds to the simple reflection @xmath35 at the hyperplane perpendicular to the simple root @xmath36 .",
    "the action of the coxeter group is to permute these root vectors , and its structure is thus encoded in the collection @xmath37 of all such roots , which in turn form a root system .    after explaining the reflection group framework , we now move onto the singularly simple prescription for performing reflections that clifford algebra affords , in spaces of any dimension and signature .",

    "this prescription for reflecting vectors in hyperplanes is remarkably compact ; and by compounding reflections one is led to defining a versor as a multivector @xmath51 which is the product of @xmath52 unit vectors @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "versors form a multiplicative group called the versor / pinor group @xmath54 under the single - sided multiplication with the geometric product , with inverses given by @xmath55 , where the tilde denotes the reversal of the order of the constituent vectors @xmath56 , and the @xmath57-sign defines its parity .",
    "every orthogonal transformation @xmath58 of a vector @xmath49 can thus be expressed via unit versors via @xmath59 unit versors are double - covers of the respective orthogonal transformation , as @xmath46 and @xmath60 encode the same transformation .",
    "even versors , called spinors or rotors , form a subgroup of the @xmath54 group and a double covering of the special orthogonal group , called the @xmath61 group .",
    "clifford algebra therefore affords a particularly natural and simple construction of the @xmath61 groups .",
    "the versor realisation of the orthogonal group is much simpler than conventional matrix approaches .",
    "table [ tab:1 ] summarises the various action mechanisms of multivectors : a rotation ( e.g. the continuous group @xmath62 or the discrete subgroup the chiral tetrahedral group @xmath63 ) are given by double - sided action of a spinor @xmath43 , whilst these spinors themselves form a group under single - sided action / multiplication ( e.g. the continuous group @xmath64 or the discrete subgroup the binary tetrahedral group @xmath65 ) .",
    "likewise , a reflection ( continuous @xmath66 or the discrete subgroup the full tetrahedral group the coxeter group @xmath0 ) corresponds to sandwiching with the versor @xmath46 , whilst the versors single - sidedly form a multiplicative group ( the @xmath67 group or the discrete analogue , the double cover of @xmath0 , which we denote @xmath68 ) . as we shall see later in the cga setup one uses the fact that the conformal group @xmath1 is homomorphic to @xmath69 to treat translations as well as rotations in a unified versor framework ( see section [ sec_cga ] ) .",
    "thus conformal and modular transformations are carried out by sandwiching with multivectors in a representation space with signature @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath71    the geometric algebra of three dimensions @xmath72 is spanned by three orthogonal ( thus anticommuting ) unit vectors @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and contains the three bivectors @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 that all square to @xmath79 , as well as the highest grade object @xmath80 ( trivector and pseudoscalar ) , which also squares to @xmath79 .",
    "here we work out a detailed case , for which we choose the tetrahedral group @xmath0 as both the simplest and most salient example .",
    "@xmath0 is the smallest out of the polyhedral groups ( the octahedral group @xmath81 is twice the order and the icosahedral group @xmath17 is five times the order ) .",
    "however , it is also the only one that does not contain the inversion  this means that the @xmath54 double cover does not simply consist of two copies of the @xmath61 group , as is the case for @xmath81 and @xmath17 .",
    "this point has led to much confusion in the literature , in particular as regards pure quaternions @xcite , which was cleared up in the context of the induction theorem of the next section in @xcite .",
    "we choose as our set of simple roots for @xmath0 @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . taking the closure of these simple roots under the simple reflections generated by them generates a root system consisting of 12 roots , which form the vertices of a cuboctahedron .",
    "one can then multiply these root vectors together in the clifford algebra to form higher grade multivectors that encode various different geometric transformations .",
    "however , rather than freely multiplying these vectors together , in this section we focus on even products of root vectors , e.g. @xmath85 etc .",
    "this yields a set of 24 spinors , @xmath86 , which is the binary polyhedral group @xmath65 .",
    "it is the even subgroup of the pinor group of order 48 and gives a double cover of the rotational / chiral tetrahedral group of order 12 .",

    "table [ tab:2 ] details the set of conjugacy classes for the spinor group , the binary tetrahedral group @xmath65 .",
    "it has 24 elements and 7 conjugacy classes , and calculations in the algebra are very straightforward ; standard approaches would have to somehow move from @xmath62 rotation matrices to @xmath118 matrices for the binary group  here both are treated in the same framework .",
    "the elements @xmath88 and @xmath79 are of course in conjugacy classes by themselves ( @xmath87 and @xmath119 ) , and then there are four conjugacy classes of order 4 . as spinors ,",
    "these are precisely one class which we denote by @xmath90 ( e.g. contains @xmath43 ) , its negative @xmath120 ( contains @xmath121 ) , its inverse @xmath100 ( contains @xmath122 ) and the negative of its inverse @xmath105 ( contains @xmath123 ) .",

    "one finds that 16 group elements can be written as @xmath143 for the 8 permutations of @xmath144 .",
    "these spinors are precisely those giving 3-fold rotations , i.e. the bivectors give the four planes of 3-fold symmetry of the cuboctahedron and tetrahedron ( vertices and faces ) .",
    "the 4 types of spinors @xmath145 for four different bivectors therefore correspond to the four @xmath90 conjugacy classes above , since the two @xmath57 signs encode @xmath121 and @xmath122 , respectively .",

    "the two conjugacy classes of order 8 give the same rotations , so result in an @xmath202 in @xmath0 ; likewise the remaining two @xmath192 and @xmath196 give a @xmath203 in @xmath0 , whilst the 12 root vectors @xmath188 only give 6 different reflections , i.e. another @xmath110 .",

    "the versor formalism is particularly powerful in the cga approach @xcite , as translations and other conformal transformations can also be handled multiplicatively as versors , which is interesting for lattices and quasicrystals @xcite .",
    "the conformal space of signature @xmath204 is given by adding two orthogonal unit vectors @xmath205 and @xmath206 to the algebra of the plane @xcite .",
    "it is therefore spanned by the unit vectors @xmath207 the 2d vector @xmath208 is then represented as a null vector in the conformal space by defining @xmath209 , and we enforce the normalisation @xmath210 .",
    "a null @xmath211 allows for a homogeneous ( projective ) representation of points .",
    "the 2d conformal group is 6-dimensional and consists of 2 translations @xmath212 by a vector @xmath213 which are given by a spinor @xmath214 via @xmath215 , the usual rotation in the plane @xmath216 , a dilation generated by @xmath217 and two special conformal transformations @xmath218 , where we can just take @xmath213 to be @xmath73 and @xmath74 for simplicity ; reflections in a ( spatial ) vector @xmath213 are not needed in the connected component of the conformal group as such , but are of course the fundamental building block given by @xmath219 , and inversions are given by reflecting in @xmath205 , @xmath220 .",
    "clifford analysis does not appear to have been applied to the particularly relevant area of 2d conformal field theory yet , which is the most important in the context of string theory , and has instead focused on general features in arbitrary dimensions rather than low - dimensional accidental properties , such as the fact that the 2d conformal algebra is infinite which makes ( anti)holomorphic functions a central concept in 2d cft . for the usual definitions of @xmath221 and @xmath222 in clifford analysis and defining the vector fields",

    "the modular group is a subgroup of the conformal group . given the complex structure of a torus @xmath20 one can embed the torus as a parallelogram tiling of the complex plane , with periodicity conditions across opposite edges , resulting in modularity in the complex plane : the torus does not change under wrapping around a circular direction , corresponding to a symmetry generator @xmath225 , nor under swapping the two circular directions , with the generator @xmath226 .",
    "@xmath227 and @xmath63 generate the modular group ; its defining relations are @xmath228 , i.e. it is the triangle group @xmath229 .",

    "the dimensions of the smallest irreducible representations of the monster group @xmath230 are @xmath231 .",
    "since the torus is periodic in two directions , one can fourier expand and get a set of coefficients for any modular function ; in particular for the generating function of modular functions , the klein @xmath232 modular function , one gets @xmath233 , where @xmath234 .",
    "monstrous moonshine is then the observation that these two seemingly very different areas of mathematics are intimately related via @xmath235 , @xmath236 and so on .",
    "the moonshine phenomenon we are currently interested in is somewhat different @xcite : it concerns as the analogue of the modular form ( in fact a weak jacobi form ) the elliptic genus of an @xmath237 superconformal field theory compactified on a @xmath238-surface ; the elliptic genus of @xmath238 has been known since the 80s and looks very unsurprising , unless one rewrites it in an inspired way in terms of the @xmath237 characters @xcite as @xmath239 where all the coefficients in the @xmath240-series @xmath241 are twice the dimension of some irreducible representation of the matthieu group @xmath242 whose irreps have dimensions @xmath243 ) .",
    "modularity is therefore very topical , also in other areas @xcite , and a clifford perspective on holomorphic and modular functions could have rather profound consequences .    in cga , the vector @xmath208 is related to the complex structure @xmath244 via @xmath245 .",

    "@xmath227 acts as @xmath249 .",
    "this corresponds to an inversion @xmath250 , followed by a reflection in @xmath73 , @xmath251 .",
    "thus , @xmath227 is given by @xmath252 via @xmath253 . since @xmath254 it is obvious that @xmath227 satisfies the first defining relation @xmath255 .",
    "it is also easy to show that @xmath256 in cga , so the second defining relation is also satisfied , and @xmath257 is essentially a 3-fold rotation in conformal space ( see section [ sec_bin ] ) .",

    "<S> in this paper , we make the case that clifford algebra is the natural framework for root systems and reflection groups , as well as related groups such as the conformal and modular groups : the metric that exists on these spaces can always be used to construct the corresponding clifford algebra . via the cartan - dieudonn theorem all the transformations of interest </S>",
    "<S> can be written as products of reflections and thus via ` sandwiching ' with clifford algebra multivectors . </S>",
    "<S> these multivector groups can be used to perform concrete calculations in different groups , e.g. the various types of polyhedral groups , and we treat the example of the tetrahedral group @xmath0 in detail . as an aside , this gives a constructive result that induces from every 3d root system a root system in dimension four , which hinges on the facts that the group of spinors provides a double cover of the rotations , the space of 3d spinors has a 4d euclidean inner product , and with respect to this inner product the group of spinors can be shown to be closed under reflections . in particular the 4d root systems / coxeter groups induced in this way are precisely the exceptional ones , with the 3d spinorial point of view also explaining their unusual automorphism groups . </S>",
    "<S> this construction simplifies arnold s trinities and puts the mckay correspondence into a wider framework . </S>",
    "<S> we finally discuss extending the conformal geometric algebra approach to the 2d conformal and modular groups , which could have interesting novel applications in conformal field theory , string theory and modular form theory . </S>"
