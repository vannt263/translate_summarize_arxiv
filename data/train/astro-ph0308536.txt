    "is a spectacularly variable accreting black hole in our galaxy .",
    "it was first detected in x - rays by the watch all sky monitor on board the _ granat _ satellite in 1992 ( castro - tirado , brandt & lund 1992 ) , but achieved fame when radio observations showed it to be the first galactic superluminal source , implying relativistic plasma ejection ( mirabel & rodrguez 1994 ) .",
    "several more superluminal jet sources have since been found ( gro j165540 , xte j1748288 , v4641 sgr ) , while a much larger number of black holes ( the _ microquasars _ ) show jet - like radio morphology ( e.g. mirabel & rodrguez 1999 ) .",
    "mildly relativistic jets are now recognized as a common feature of black holes at high mass accretion rates ( fender & kuulkers 2001 ) .    however ,  is still unique in its variability properties . on long timescales ,",
    "its outburst duration of over 10 years is unprecedented , and completely at odds with the predictions of the disc instability models which can successfully describe some aspects of the other black hole transient outbursts ( king & ritter 1998 ; dubus , hameury & lasota 2001 ; esin , lasota & hynes 2000 ) . on short timescales ,",
    "the x - ray variability is even more singular , showing episodes where it continually switches between states in a quasi  regular way ( greiner , morgan & remillard 1996 ; chen , swank & taam 1997 ) .",
    "belloni et al .",
    "( 1997a ) showed that these rapid changes were associated with the accretion disc spectrum switching from hot and bright , implying a small inner disc radius , to cooler and dimmer , with a larger inferred radius .",
    "they interpreted this as the result of a limit - cycle instability in the inner accretion disc , such that it is continually emptying and refilling .",
    "following belloni et al .",
    "( 1997a , b ) , most models for the origin of this unique limit - cycle behaviour of the accretion disc have concentrated on the radiation pressure instability in a standard shakura - sunyaev accretion disc ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . in the @xmath0 disc prescription",
    "the viscous heating is proportional to the total pressure @xmath1 , i.e. the sum of the gas and radiation pressures . where radiation pressure dominates the heating rate is dramatically sensitive to temperature ( @xmath2 compared to @xmath3 ) , and the radiative and convective cooling in the disc can not keep pace . by itself",
    ", this would just lead to the classic thermal - viscous instability ( lightman & eardley 1974 ; shakura & sunyaev 1976 ) .",
    "however , there is another stable disc solution at high temperatures , where optically thick advective cooling becomes important ( abramowicz et al .",
    "putting all this together at a given radius and @xmath0 gives rise to an s - curve on a plot of disc surface density , @xmath4 versus mass accretion rate through the disc , @xmath5 .",
    "the lower , middle and upper branches of the s corresponding to heating @xmath6 balanced by radiative cooling ( stable ) , heating @xmath7 balanced by radiative cooling ( unstable ) and heating @xmath7 balanced by advective cooling ( stable ; abramowicz et al .  1988 ; chen et al .",
    "no steady state equilibrium solution is possible at mass accretion rates corresponding to the middle branch .",
    "instead there is a continual limit - cycle with the material switching between the two stable states , one which has too high a mass accretion rate , leading to the emptying of the disc , and one with too low as mass accretion rate , so the disc refills .",
    "however , it is difficult to understand why the radiation pressure instability is not apparent in other black hole x - ray transients ( see e.g. gierliski & done 2003b , hereafter gd03 ) .",
    "the only features distinguishing black holes are mass and spin .",
    "is the most massive galactic black hole known at @xmath814  m@xmath9 ( greiner , cuby & mccaughrean 2001a ) , but this is not significantly larger than the typical @xmath10 of the other black holes ( bailyn et al .",
    "it may well be spinning close to maximal , but so may gro  j165540 ( zhang , cui & chen 1997 ; cui , zhang & chen 1998 ) .",
    "if the difference is not in the black hole itself , then it must be connected to the accretion flow .",
    "accretes at high fractions of the eddington limit , but so do many other black hole transients ( see e.g the review by tanaka & lewin 1995 ) .",
    "has a jet , which is clearly linked to limit - cycle behaviour of the disc ( pooley & fender 1997 ; eikenberry et al .",
    "1998 ) , but the ratio of radio to x - ray power is similar to that of other x - ray transients ( fender & kuulkers 2001 ) . why then is the variability from  unique ?    recently , done & gierliski ( 2003 ; hereafter dg03 ) used the huge _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) database to systematically analyze the spectra of many black hole systems .",
    "these were all consistent with the _ same _ spectral evolution as a function of eddington luminositym@xmath9 erg s@xmath11 for a mass @xmath12 throughout this paper .",
    "] fraction , @xmath13 , so these form a ` normal ' black hole sample for comparison with .",
    "here we analyze the _ rxte _ data on  and plot it together with the ` normal ' black holes .",
    "we show that  is unique in being the only black hole binary which spends any considerable time above @xmath14 , and speculate that this is the trigger for the limit - cycle variability in .",
    "the reason  alone gets to such consistently high mass accretion rates can be simply related to its evolutionary state .",
    "the secondary is a giant ( greiner et al .",
    "2001b ) , so roche lobe overflow occurs in a much wider binary than for a main sequence star .",
    "the 33.5-day period of  is by far the longest of any low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) known .",
    "this implies a huge disc size , as the outer radius is set by tidal truncation . during quiescence",
    "the disc builds up an immense reservoir of mass , which can fall onto the black hole when the outburst is triggered ( king & ritter 1998 ) .",
    "the underlying cause of all the unique long and short - term variability of  is then ultimately linked to the evolution of the huge disc structure , which can contain enough material to maintain super - eddington accretion rates over timescales of tens of years .",
    "_ rxte _ has been in operation since january 1996 . the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board _ rxte _ had undergone several major gain changes , marking five instrument epochs .",
    "here we analyze all pca data before the end of pca epoch 4 , i.e. observations between 1996 april 6 and 2000 may 11 ( epoch 5 is marked by the loss of the propane layer for detector 0 ) .",
    "we use ftools 5.2 and follow standard data reduction procedure as recommended by the _ rxte _ team . to maximize the number of observations",
    "which can be used we select data from pca detector 0 only , as it is switched on most of the time .",
    "the source is dramatically variable so we extract data in 128-s bins , giving a quite overwhelming number of 16489 individual spectra .",
    "there is variability on shorter timescales ( see e.g. belloni et al .",
    "2000 ; hereafter b00 ) but this is the shortest timescale on which the spectra are generally limited by systematic errors ( set to 1 per cent ) rather than statistical errors below 10 kev .",
    "we also accumulate both light curves and spectra for each of the 500 separate pointings , designated by unique observation ids , typically each giving a few kiloseconds of data .",
    "the light curves for each observation i d are extracted over 320 kev with the 16-second time resolution of the standard 2 data .",
    "we use xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) to fit the pca data in 320  kev range with 1 per cent error added in each energy channel to represent the systematic uncertainties of the detector response .",
    "we assume the abundances of anders & ebihara ( 1982 ) unless stated otherwise , and fix the interstellar galactic absorbing column at @xmath15 @xmath16 ( chaty et al .",
    "1996 ) . for calculating luminosities we assume distance of 12.5  kpc ( mirabel & rodrguez 1994 but see fender et al . 1999 ) .",
    "all parameter ranges are quoted for @xmath17 = 2.7 .",
    "following dg03 we fit a physically motivated continuum model consisting of a multicolour disc spectrum which also forms the seed photons for compton scattering to higher energies .",
    "we use the diskbb model ( mistuda et al .  1984 ) to describe the disc emission .",
    "the temperature is constrained to @xmath18  kev . so as not to produce an unphysically large component outside of the energy range of the pca data .",
    "for comptonization we use thcomp ( not included in the standard distribution of xspec , see zdziarski , johnson & magdziarz 1996 ) , parameterized by asymptotic photon spectral index ( @xmath19 ) and electron temperature ( @xmath20 100 kev ) .",
    "the physically motivated continuum model does not fully describe the observed spectra from x - ray binaries as there is also compton reflection from the disc .",
    "following dg03 we approximate this by adding a broad gaussian line ( width fixed at @xmath21  kev ) and smeared edge ( index for photoelectric cross - section fixed at -2.67 and smearing width of 7  kev ; see ebisawa 1991 ) .",
    "this model spectrum is described as m1 in table  [ tab : models ] and throughout the text .",
    "we use this to fit each 128-s spectrum from .",
    "it gives a good description of most of the data ; only 5 per cent have reduced @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is number of degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we follow the approach of dg03 in compressing all the resulting spectral information from the model fits into two _ intrinsic _ colours , which are calculated by integrating the ( absorption corrected ) model flux over 4 energy bands ( 34 , 46.4 , 6.49.7 , 9.716  kev ) to form soft and hard colours .",
    "these roughly describe the unabsorbed spectral slope from 36.4 kev and 6.416 kev , respectively .",
    "this method contrasts with that of the more usual instrument colours , which are defined using the ratios of observed counts in given energy bands ( as opposed to modelled flux ratios ) .",
    "both methods have their advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the advantage of our method is that modelling corrects for both instrument response and absorption in a single step , and gives colours which reflect the underlying source spectrum .",
    "thus many objects , with data taken from many different instruments and/or gain epochs , with very different absorption columns , can be easily plotted together on the same diagram .",
    "instrument colours can be modified to correct for different gain epochs ( e.g. di salvo et al .",
    "2003 , van straaten et al .",
    "2003 ) , but different absorptions prevent a straightforward comparison of many different objects .",
    "another advantage of our approach is that the model spectra allow us to estimate the _ bolometric _ luminosity , which is surely a major physical driver of the spectral evolution .",
    "the disadvantage of course is that these luminosities are model dependent ( though the colours are not as long as absorption does not substantially affect the spectrum above 3 kev : dg03 ) . more importantly , the requirement for good signal - to - noise spectra for the model fitting means that the intrinsic colours have lower time resolution than the instrument ones .",
    "belloni et al .",
    "( 2000 : hereafter b00 ) used instrument colours for their major study of the variability of  as seen in epoch 3 .",

    "the dotted line shows the continuation of this track which is seen in high time resolution data .",

    "[ fig : bell_col ] ) , whereas the straightforward instrument colours are strongly affected , with data from different epochs ending up at very different position in the diagram ( epoch 2 has much higher hr1 and hr2 than epoch 3 , while epoch 4 has much lower hr1 and hr2 ) . while these gain change effects can be corrected for ( di salvo et al .",
    "2003 ; van straaten et al .",
    "2003 ) , the key issue in this paper is that the unabsorbed flux ratios shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bell_col]c can be _ directly compared _ with the unabsorbed colours from many other black holes given in e.g. dg03 .",
    "we can use this straightforward comparison of multiple objects to search for the differences between  and the ` normal ' black holes which underlay its unique variability .",
    "b00 show that the unique limit - cycle variability of  occurs in only @xmath850 per cent of the data . rather than do a detailed classification of the variability pattern ( as in b00 ) , we simply parameterize the variability in a given observation ( one individual _ rxte _ pointing with unique observation i d ) by calculating the fractional r.m.s .",
    "( variance divided by mean intensity ) from its light curve with resolution of 16 s. some of the observations are too short for this to be reliable , so we restrict this to light curves in which there are more than 128 data points ( i.e.  over 2048 s of data ) .",
    "this fractional r.m.s . represents the integral of the power spectrum from frequencies lower than 1/2048 to 1/32 hz .",
    "the low frequency power spectrum is generally flatter than @xmath25 ( e.g. morgan et al .",
    "1997 ) so the fractional r.m.s . is not strongly dependent on the length of the light curve .    assuming that the power spectrum is stable for each type of variability , we can use the individual observation ids identified by b00 as being characteristic of each class to get an estimate of their fractional r.m.s .. the state transition classes @xmath26 and @xmath27 have @xmath28 and @xmath29 per cent variability , respectively , while the single state classes @xmath30 and @xmath31 have @xmath29 and @xmath32 per cent , respectively . while it is plain that our crude fractional r.m.s .",
    "criteria can not make subtle distinctions between the types of state transition , nevertheless it is clear that restricting the fractional r.m.s . to less than 5 per cent will select typically only the @xmath31 stable state ( through may include a little contamination by the @xmath30 and @xmath27 type of variability ) , while selecting fractional r.m.s .",
    "greater than 40 per cent will pick out the dramatic state transition variability of type @xmath33 ( perhaps with a little contribution from @xmath34 and @xmath35 states .",
    "it is these dramatic variability patterns which are unique to  which we want to identify .",
    "the intrinsic colours for the resulting 292 spectra were found using the model described above . obviously , some of the spectra are averaged over periods of high variability , including the limit - cycle spectral transitions .",
    "these do _ not _ represent real physical spectra : the average of two blackbodies of different temperatures is _ not _ a blackbody at the average temperature , nor is the average of two power laws of different spectral slopes given by a single power law of the average slope !",
    "instead , the colours extracted from these spectra give the time averaged position of the source on the colour - colour diagram .",

    "the high absorption means that the derived soft colour and disc luminosity change substantially with changing the model .",
    "nonetheless , we now have a physical model which incorporates all the observed spectral features so we can at least use this to get our best estimate for the intrinsic colours of the system .",

    "all the other spectra are harder , so a higher proportion of iron can be completely ionized , giving smaller equivalent width features .",
    "this can also feedback onto the wind acceleration mechanism if there is considerable line driving , so that there is intrinsically less wind at higher ionization ( e.g. proga & kallman 2002 ) .",
    "while our physically based models give generally good fits to all the individual observation i d spectra , these data are extracted from full _ rxte _ pointings .",

    "fortunately , the spectral fits from section  [ sec : obsids ] show that most of the change in derived soft colour and soft luminosity between the simple phenomenological description and the more physical model arises from the change in cold absorption . yet most of the increase in fitting time comes from modelling reflection .",
    "hence we use the simple phenomenological model of smeared edge and broad line to describe reflection ( as in model m1 of table  [ tab : models ] ) , with fixed anomalous abundances of si and fe to test how well this can reproduce the colours and luminosities derived from the physical model ( we call this model m5 ; see table  [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "a fit of this simple model to the seven selected spectra from section  [ sec : obsids ] shows that it gives a very good match to the colours from the physical model , and reproduces the soft luminosities to within a factor of @xmath82 .",

    "1999 , though the lower limit could present significant problems for the derived luminosity of the companion star : greiner et al 2001b ) so this could reduce the bolometric luminosity estimates by at most a factor 4 .",
    "thus it seems that the trigger for the characteristic limit - cycle variability in  is almost certainly super - eddington accretion rates .",
    "is the most luminous black hole system studied here , and is also the only one to show the characteristic limit - cycle variability .",
    "plainly the results are consistent with the accretion flow onto a black hole becoming unstable at very high luminosities of @xmath50 .",
    "the same instability does not seem to operate in neutron stars .",
    "z sources emit at 13 @xmath47 , while cir x-1 can reach up to @xmath51 ( dg03 ) . approximately half of the neutron star luminosity should be from the boundary layer , so the accretion flow luminosity is only @xmath80.51.5 @xmath47 in the z sources , perhaps too low to trigger the instability ( but not in cir x-1 ) .",
    "alternatively , irradiation of the accretion flow by the boundary layer may act as a stabilizing mechanism ( czerny , czerny & grindlay 1986 , but see mineshige & kusenose 1993 and below ) .",
    "following belloni et al .",
    "( 1997a , b ) , the instability itself is generally associated with the well known radiation pressure instability of a standard @xmath0 disc at high luminosities ( lightman & eardley 1974 ; shakura & sunyaev 1976 ) . in its simplest form",
    "this predicts that the inner accretion flow cycles between a highly luminous , hot , advection - dominated disc and a much lower luminosity , cooler , gas pressure - dominated disc ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ; honma , matsumoto & kato 1991 ; szuszkiewicz & miller 1997 , 1998 ; zampieri , turolla & szuszkiewicz 2001 ) .",
    "one key problem with this interpretation is that the limit - cycle variability should occur at well below @xmath47 ( see nayakshin , rappaport & melia 2000 for other problems ) .",
    "theoretical models show that the limit cycles become noticeable at @xmath52 ( janiuk , czerny & siemiginowska 2002 ) , yet",
    "_ none _ of the comparison sample of ` normal ' black holes above this luminosity show the limit cycle ( kubota et al .",
    "2001 ; kubota & makishima 2003 ; gd03 ) .",
    "gd03 summarize various ways to delay the onset of the radiation pressure instability in a standard disc .",
    "generally these involve some additional energy loss channel e.g. dissipating some of the accretion energy in a hard x - ray corona , or via a wind or jet .",
    "the problem with these is that the ` normal ' black holes can show disc - dominated spectra ( so no obvious energy loss in a corona / jet ) without producing the instability even at @xmath53 ( gd03 ) .",
    "by contrast  shows strong coronal emission _ and _ has a jet _ and _ a wind , _ all _ of which should act to stabilize the disc , yet _ does _ show the instability .",
    "irradiation of the disc by the strong coronal emission should also act as a stabilizing mechanism , similarly to that proposed for the boundary layer in neutron stars ( czerny et al .",
    "thus it seems unlikely that irradiation alone can stabilize the disc in the z sources since it does not manage to stabilize .",
    "the ` normal ' black holes show that the disc is stable up to at least @xmath54 , so its structure must be rather different from that predicted by the standard @xmath0 disc equations ( gd03 ) .",
    "the fact that the instability in  is triggered at or near eddington luminosity seems to suggest that radiation pressure does play a pivotal role in the formation of the dramatic variability .",
    "that the @xmath0 disc equations do not work in detail is perhaps not surprising given the _",
    "ad hoc _ nature of viscous heating in these models .",
    "the next generation of disc models will give a much better estimate for the disc structure , as these can incorporate the mhd dynamo which is the physical origin of the viscosity ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) .",
    "when these models are sufficiently developed to solve the time dependent 3d , coupled radiation and magneto - hydrodynamic equations over a substantial range of radii ( turner , stone & sano 2002 ; turner et al .",
    "2003 ) then the question of inner disc stability for highly luminous systems can be revisited .",
    "the unique short - term limit - cycle variability of  is plausibly because it reaches higher @xmath13 than any other known galactic black hole .",
    "but then the question becomes why  alone reaches such high luminosities ?",
    "the answer to this lies in the evolutionary state of .",
    "the system has the longest known period of any lmxb of 33.5 days , implying a very wide orbit ( greiner et al .",
    "the secondary is a low - mass giant star ( greiner et al .",
    "2001b ) , so the accretion takes place via roche lobe overflow ( eikenberry & bandyopadhyay 2000 ) .",
    "there is now considerable agreement that transient outbursts in the lmxbs are caused by the classic disc instability mechanism which operates when hydrogen goes from being mainly neutral to mainly ionized .",
    "this is a very different physical mechanism for a disc instability than the radiation pressure instability discussed above , and happens at much lower luminosity , but it gives rise to another s - shaped thermal equilibrium curve ( smak 1982 ) . in discs around white dwarfs it can trigger limit cycles where there are disc outbursts on timescales of days  weeks , followed by a period of quiescence lasting weeks  months ( see e.g. the review by osaki 1996 ) . in lmxbs the disc structure",
    "is strongly modified by irradiation once the outburst starts , keeping hydrogen ionized for much longer so that the outburst timescales are dramatically extended ( van paradijs 1996 ; king 1997 ; king & ritter 1998 ; dubus et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the peak luminosity at the start of the lmxb outburst is determined by the disc size , @xmath55 .",
    "the maximum mass the disc can hold before going into outburst is @xmath56 , while the inflow timescale is @xmath57 .",
    "thus the peak luminosity @xmath58 so the bigger the disc , the bigger the peak luminosity ( king & ritter 1998 ) . but the disc size in lmxb is fixed by tidal torques to @xmath81.4@xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the circularization radius of the binary ( shahbaz , charles & king 1998 ) , and the binary system parameters are determined by the requirement that the secondary star can overflow its roche lobe . for main sequence secondaries",
    "the orbit must be fairly small , so the disc is small .",
    "has a giant secondary , so has a huge disc , with @xmath61 cm for a mass ratio of @xmath62 ( e.g. frank , king & raine 1992 ) .",
    "the quiescent disc mass is @xmath810@xmath63 g ( shahbaz , charles & king 1998 ) , which can maintain an eddington accretion rate for @xmath810 years , similar to observed outburst timescale .",
    "thus both the long and short - term unique variability behaviour of  can be explained as a function of its evolutionary state , where the wide orbit allows a huge disc to form .",
    "is not in a separate class from ` normal ' black holes .",
    "when it is at the same @xmath13 then its spectra and ( more importantly ) time variability behaviour are similar to that seen in the normal black holes .",
    "its unique limit cycle variability only appears when it radiates at uniquely high ( super eddington ) luminosities .",
    "boldly goes to luminosities where no black hole has gone before , and we eagerly await the next generation of disc models which will more clearly identify the origin of the instability .",
