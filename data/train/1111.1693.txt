    "galaxy clusters are believed to form under the action of gravity in the hierarchical scenario of cosmic structure formation ( e.g. voit 2005 ) . they assemble cosmic baryons from the field and",
    "heat them up through adiabatic compression and shocks that take place during the dark matter halo collapse and accretion .",
    "simple self - similar relations between the physical properties in clusters are then predicted ( e.g. kaiser 1986 , 1991 , evrard & henry 1991 ) since gravity does not have any preferred scale and hydrostatic equilibrium between intra ",
    "cluster medium ( icm ) emitting in the x  rays ( mostly by thermal bremsstrahlung ) and the cluster potential is a reasonable assumption .",
    "these scaling relations are particularly relevant to connect observed quantities , such as x  ray luminosity , temperature and mass , to total cluster mass , which is used to constrain cosmological parameters ( e.g. allen , mantz & evrard 2011 ) .",
    "work in recent years has focused in defining x - ray mass proxies , i.e. observables which are at the same time relatively easy to measure and tightly related to total cluster mass by scaling relations having low intrinsic scatter as well as a robustly predicted slope and redshift evolution ( e.g. kravtsov et al .",

    "an important role in defining such proxies and assessing their robustness is played currently by cosmological hydrodynamical simulations , thanks to their ever improving numerical resolution and sophistication in the description of the physical processes determining the icm evolution ( e.g. borgani & kravtsov 2009 ) .    in this letter , we present and discuss the behaviour of the scaling relations generalized to include the dependence upon two independent observables , one accounting for the gas density distribution ( namely gas mass @xmath1 and x - ray luminosity @xmath2 ) , the other tracing the icm temperature , @xmath3 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the scaling relations investigated . in section  3",
    ", we discuss the redshift evolution and the normalization of these relations , and how they depend on the selection adopted to define the sample analyzed . in section  4 ,",
    "we summarize and discuss our results in view of their application to observational data .",
    "under the assumptions that the smooth and spherically symmetric intra - cluster medium ( icm ) emits by thermal bremsstrahlung and is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the underlying gravitational potential , the self - similar ( ss ) scenario relates bolometric luminosity , @xmath2 , gas temperature , @xmath3 , gas mass , @xmath1 , to the total mass , @xmath14 in a simple and straightforward way .",
    "for instance , the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath15 , allows to write @xmath16 , as long as the slope of temperature and gas density profiles are independent of cluster mass . by combining it with the definition of the total mass within a given overdensity @xmath17 with respect to the critical density at the cluster s redshift @xmath18 , @xmath19 , one obtains that @xmath20 , where @xmath21^{1/2}$ ] for a flat cosmology with matter density parameter @xmath22 , cosmological constant and hubble constant at the present time @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , the definition of the bremsstrahlung emissivity @xmath24 ( the latter being valid for systems sufficiently hot , e.g. @xmath25 kev ) relates the bolometric luminosity , @xmath2 , and the gas temperature , @xmath3 : @xmath26 @xmath27 , where we have made use of the above relation between total mass and temperature .    by combining these basic equations , we obtain that the scaling relations among the x - ray properties and the total mass are ( see also ettori et al .",

    "kravtsov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) introduced the @xmath31 mass proxy , which is given by the product of temperature and gas mass .",
    "owing to its definition , it is related to the total thermal energy of the icm .",
    "they demonstrated that , among the known mass indicators , @xmath31 is a very robust mass proxy .",
    "its scaling relation with @xmath32 being characterized by an intrinsic scatter of only 57 per cent at fixed @xmath31 , regardless of the dynamical state of the cluster and redshift , with a redshift evolution very close to the prediction of self - similar model .",
    "arnaud et al .",
    "( 2007 ) used _ xmm - newton _  data of a sample of 10 relaxed nearby clusters spanning a @xmath31 range of @xmath33 kev , and confirmed that the @xmath34 relation has a slope close to the self - similar value of @xmath35 , independent of the mass range considered .",
    "they showed that the normalisation of this relation is about 20 per cent below the prediction of numerical simulations which include cooling and supernova ( sn ) feedback , and explained this offset with two different effects : an underestimate of true mass due to a violation of the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium , and an underestimate of hot gas mass fraction in the simulations ( see also zhang et al .",
    "they confirmed that @xmath31 might indeed be a better mass proxy than @xmath3 and @xmath1 by comparing the functional form and scatter of the relations between different observables and mass .",
    "extensive use of the @xmath36 relation has been made in recent analyses aimed at constraining cosmological parameters through the evolution of the cluster mass function ( e.g. vikhlinin et al .",

    "( 2009 ) presented the x - ray luminosity scaling relations of 31 nearby clusters from the representative _ xmm - newton _  cluster structure survey ( rexcess ) , all having temperature in the range 29 kev and selected in x - ray luminosity so as to properly sample the cluster luminosity function .",
    "their analysis showed that scaling relations between bolometric x - ray luminosity and temperature , @xmath31 and total mass , are all well represented by power ",
    "law shapes with slopes significantly steeper than self - similar predictions .",
    "they concluded that structural variations have little effect on the steepening , whereas it is largely affected by a systematic variation of the gas content with mass .",
    "maughan ( 2007 ) analysed chandra acis - i data for 115 galaxy clusters at @xmath37 observed to investigate the relation between luminosity and @xmath31 .",
    "they found that the scatter is dominated by cluster cores , and a tight @xmath38 relation ( 11 per cent intrinsic scatter in @xmath39 ) is recovered if sufficiently large core regions ( @xmath40 ) are excluded .",
    "the tight correlation between @xmath31 and mass and the self - similar evolution of that scaling relation out to @xmath41 is confirmed .",
    "fabjan et al .",
    "( 2011 ) analysed an extended set of cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters , and confirmed that the @xmath42 scaling law is the least sensitive to variations of the physics in the icm and very close , in terms of slope and evolution , to predictions of the self  similar model .",
    "they also pointed out that @xmath43 is the relation with the smallest scatter in mass , whereas @xmath44 is the one with the largest among the considered scaling relations .",
    "in the present work , we generalise the definition of the @xmath31 mass proxy , by considering the scaling relation between total mass , @xmath45 , and a more general proxy defined in such a way that @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is either @xmath1 or @xmath2 and @xmath48 .",
    "the use of this relation generalizes the relation @xmath49 , while maintaining the attitude to recover total mass by combining information on depth of the halo gravitational potential ( through the gas temperature @xmath3 ) and distribution of gas density ( traced by @xmath1 and x - ray luminosity ) , the latter being more affected by the physical processes determining the icm properties . in doing that",
    ", we aim to minimize the scatter in the relations between total mass and observables by ( i ) relaxing the assumption of the self - similarity , ( ii ) adopting a general and flexible function with a minimal set of free parameters , ( iii ) offering a method that can be readjusted in dependence of the specific sample selection adopted .    in the recent past ,",

    "( 2010 ) presented an extensive discussion on the relaxation of some assumptions on the parametrization of the relation between optical richness and total mass , by introducing the possibility of deviation from a power  law shape , as well as richness and mass  dependence of intrinsic scatter .    to study the behaviour of the @xmath52 relation in minimizing the scatter , we used a sample of 24 lagrangian regions , selected around the most massive clusters with a radius equal to five times the virial radius , and extracted from a parent low - resolution n - body cosmological simulation with a box of size 1@xmath53gpc comoving , as described in bonafede et al .",

    "a set of 24 lagrangian regions , centred around as many massive clusters , were re - simulated by increasing mass resolution and adding high - frequency modes to the power spectrum ( tormen et al . 1997 ) . within the high resolution region ,",
    "dark matter particles have a mass @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 .",
    "the size of each lagrangian region was chosen in such a way that by @xmath63 there are no low  resolution particles within at least 5 virial radii from the central cluster . as a result",
    ", the large extent of each of these high  resolution regions allows one to identify more than one single cluster  sized halo within it , which is not contaminated by low ",

( 2007 ) . by selecting only objects with mass weighted temperature @xmath65 kev",
    ", we end up with 41 objects in each sample .",
    "a subset of the _ csf _ sample has been processed through the x - mas tool ( e.g. rasia et al .",
    "2008 ) to generate chandra mock observations , and then analyzed with an observational - like approach to measure temperatures and gas masses ( _ xmas _ sample ; rasia et al .",
    "the latter sample includes all the clusters with spectroscopic - like temperature larger than 2 kev , and observed along 3 orthogonal projection directions , so that we end up with 159 mock observations of simulated clusters .",
    "total and gas masses within @xmath66 are computed as as described in fabjan et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and rasia et al .",
    "gas temperatures and luminosities , both bolometric and in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band , are computed after excising cluster core regions , which are defined as the regions enclosed within @xmath40 .",
    "the effect of core excision is also considered in the discussion of the results and is shown not to affect the conclusions of our analysis .",
    "we fit a linear relation to the log - log scaling between total mass and proxies , normalized to the average values computed within each sample of simulated clusters : @xmath67 here we defined @xmath68 , with barred quantities indicating the average values of the corresponding quantities .    within each set of simulated clusters , containing n objects ,",
    "we compute for each pair of values of the slopes @xmath69 the corresponding scatter , which is defined as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 .",
    "we then search find the locus in the @xmath72 plane where scatter is minimized in a similar . in all cases , this locus is well represented by the lines @xmath73 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ab ] ) or , in a more concise form , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 corresponds to the power to which the gas density appears in the formula of the gas mass ( @xmath76 ) and luminosity ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "this correlation between logarithmic slopes allows us to reduce by one the number of free parameter in the linear fit of the generalized scaling law between observables and total mass .",
    "it is worth noticing that these relations reduce to the standard self - similar predictions in the appropriate cases : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 are recovered for @xmath81 and @xmath35 , respectively ; @xmath82 and @xmath83 , which is the corresponding relation of @xmath80 once gas mass is replaced by luminosity , are recovered for @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "however , to represent the tilted shape of the contours encircling the region with the minimum scatter in the simulated dataset here investigated , we should prefer the following relations among the logarithmic slopes , @xmath86 that are shown as dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ab ] .    in the following discussion",
    ", we refer to the ss case described from the equations  @xmath87 as the reference one .",
    "in this section , we discuss some properties on the redshift evolution and normalization of the generalized scaling laws , and present the results of the tests by which we have verified the robustness of our predictions .      with simple mathematical substitutions , we can predict the redshift evolution expected for the ss case , @xmath88 : @xmath89    we are now in the position to look for the scaling relation which has the weakest redshift dependence or , on the contrary , the relation which makes this dependence stronger .",
    "we note that there is no dependence on redshift only in two cases among the scaling relations here investigated ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ez ] ) : ( i ) @xmath90 ( and @xmath91 ) , i.e. for the scaling law @xmath79 ; ( ii ) @xmath92 ( and @xmath93 ) , i.e. for the relation @xmath94 .",
    "the prediction for the lack of evolution of these scaling relations can be tested against observational data .      as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ab ] , the normalization @xmath13 corresponding to the value of minimum scatter is close to zero .",
    "this is expected once the quantities are normalized to the averaged values @xmath95 .",
    "however , only @xmath96 and @xmath97 are known for an observed sample .",
    "thus , by adopting one of the relations in equation  [ eqn : ab ] , one can directly measure @xmath98 and recover the total mass @xmath45 only once @xmath99 is independently evaluated either through mock samples selected from catalogs of hydrodynamically simulated objects to contain the same number of objects , and with similar properties , of the observed ones , or through a self  calibration tuned by a sub - sample of clusters for which robust mass estimates are available . under this respect ,",
    "the suggested approach is the standard one , with the same limitations affecting any other application of the scaling laws : mass calibration and selection effects .",
    "the innovation , we are proposing , is to add an extra parameter , imposing a new constraint on the slopes of the scaling laws , to allow a further minimization of the scatter .      to assess the robustness of the analysis of the simulated dataset",
    ", we have repeated our calculations by extracting the simulated objects according to different criteria , e.g. , including or excluding the cluster core emission , adopting different overdensity , using different definition for the gas temperature , selecting only very hot or massive systems .",
    "all these samples reproduce consistently the plots shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ab ] , by varying only the location of the best - fit values , but confirming the dependence among the logarithmic slopes over the region of the parameter space that minimize the measured scatter ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : a_sample ] ) .",
    "when observational data are considered , several other selection effects can still affect both the definition of a sample and the measurements of the normalization and slope of the adopted scaling law .",
    "a proper treatment of the second  order moments and of the covariance related to the scaling relation has then to be addressed ( see , e.g. , stanek et al .",
    "2010 , rozo et al . 2009 and 2010 , mantz et al .",
    "we have presented new generalized scaling relations with the prospective to reduce further the scatter between mass proxies and total cluster mass .",
    "we find a locus of minimum scatter that relates the logarithmic slopes of the two independent variables considered in the present work , namely temperature @xmath3 , which traces the depth of the cluster potential , and another one accounting for the gas density distribution , such as gas mass @xmath1 or x - ray luminosity @xmath2 . within this approach ,",
    "all the known scaling relations appear as particular realizations of generalized scaling relations .",
    "for instance , we introduced the scaling relation @xmath100 , which is analogous to the @xmath101 relation , once luminosity is used instead of gas mass .",
    "also the evolution expected in the framework of the self - similar model are predicted for the generalized scaling relations . they can be used either to maximize the evolutionary effect to test predictions of the self - similar models itself or , on the contrary , to minimize them in case of cosmological applications .",
    "a linear function in the logarithmic space can be then fitted to the data normalized to the average values measured in the sample : @xmath102 with @xmath103 , @xmath6 , @xmath104 for @xmath105 and @xmath103 , @xmath7 , @xmath106 for @xmath107 . in a more concise form",
    ", the above relation can be recast as @xmath108 , where @xmath75 corresponds to the power with which gas density appears to define either gas mass ( @xmath76 ) or luminosity ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "this fitting function has 4 free parameters that are reduced to one ( plus the average value of the total mass of the objects in the sample ) thanks to the existing tight correlation found between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , at least within the region of the @xmath72 parameter space where intrinsic scatter is minimised .",
    "the method and the results presented in this work offer a robust framework to relate , with the request of a minimum scatter , the x - ray observables to the total gravitational mass of galaxy clusters for studies of their thermodynmical properties and for cosmological application .",
