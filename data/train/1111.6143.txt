    "sight is the most important sense that we posses .",
    "it enables us to truly perceive the outer world .",
    "it is crucial to understand the mechanics of vision in order to treat various diseases that may occur and disturb regular seeing .",
    "the eye s main part responsible for about two - thirds of refractive power is the cornea .",
    "it is one of the most sensitive parts of human body and its various irregularities can cause many seeing disorders .",
    "common diseases like myopia , hyperopia or astigmatism have their origin in some abnormalities in corneal geometry .",
    "thus , precise knowledge of corneal shape is very important .",
    "we can distinguish several mathematical models of cornea which are presently in use .",
    "most commonly , cross - section of cornea is described by some conic section @xcite ( for example , parabola or ellipse ) .",
    "the drawback of these models is that they have almost no physical motivation or derivation behind them .",
    "probably the most appropriate model of corneal geometry would be done with the use of shell theory @xcite .",
    "these models usually are quite complex and hence difficult to analyse .",
    "there are also models that use zernike polynomials @xcite .",
    "these are certain orthogonal polynomials that are used to model abberations in cornea or lens .    in this paper we present another model of corneal geometry based on a nonlinear membrane equation . assuming radial symmetry we reduce it to a one - dimensional case and",
    "then provide some estimates on the exact solution . when fitting with data we use its simplified form and find that mean error is of order of a few per cent .",
    "cornea is a biological structure which is similar to a shell .",
    "its diameter is about @xmath2 and its thickness is approximately @xmath3 in the center and @xmath4 in the peripheral part @xcite .",
    "thanks to its structural parameters cornea provides a great protection for more sensitive , inner parts of the eye .",
    "we will distinguish only interior and exterior surface of cornea although it is made of five layers . in order from the most exterior they are as follows : epithelium , bowman s layer , stroma , descement s membrane and endothelium .",
    "stroma is the thickest layer sometimes identified with cornea itself .",
    "we would like to derive an equation describing the steady state shape of cornea s surface ( either interior or exterior ) .",
    "we will describe this geometry by a function @xmath5 .",
    "assume that cornea is a two - dimensional thin membrane , that is , it has no bending or twisting moments and its tension @xmath6 is constant at every point .",
    "moreover , impose a pressure @xmath7 acting from below and normally to the surface . to model",
    "cornea s elastic properties we propose an additional restoring force which is proportional to the deflection @xmath8 .",
    "finally , let @xmath9 be the domain in @xmath10 plane on which this membrane is situated .    it can be shown ( see @xcite ) that a steady state membrane equation is of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the net force density ( pressure ) acting on the membrane . in our case",
    "the equation will be @xmath13 this is a second order nonlinear partial differential equation .",
    "the square root on the right - hand - side comes from the projection of normal vector onto the vertical @xmath14-axis . for",
    "the boundary conditions we impose @xmath15 appearing constants have following dimensions : @xmath16=\\frac{n}{m}=m t^{-2}$ ] , @xmath17=\\frac{n}{m^3}=m l^{-2 } t^{-2}$ ] and @xmath18=\\frac{n}{m^2}=m l^{-1 } t^{-2}$ ] , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath6 are dimensions of mass , length and time respectively .",
    "also , let @xmath21 be a typical linear size of the cornea ( for example its radius ) .",
    "taking @xmath22 we transform ( [ dimensional ] ) into a nondimensional equation ( dropping asterisks for clarity ) @xmath23 where we denoted @xmath24 and @xmath25 . from physical reasoning",
    "we allow only positive values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we will see in section [ fitting ] that these parameters are both of order of unity .",
    "from now on @xmath9 will be an unit circle in the @xmath10-plane .",
    "we assume that cornea has radial symmetry , thus @xmath8 depends only on radius @xmath28 and in polar coordinates @xmath29 . rewriting ( [ eqlap ] )",
    "we get @xmath30 with following boundary conditions @xmath31 the condition @xmath32 guarantees absence of singularities and smoothness at the origin .",
    "we transform ( [ eqpolar ] ) into an integral equation @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath7 are defined by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) are @xmath40-order modified bessel functions of first and second kind respectively . from elementary properties of bessel functions ( see @xcite ) we can deduce the following estimates @xmath41 thus , we have @xmath42 .",
    "also , it can be shown that @xmath43 hence the function @xmath44 is nonincreasing .",
    "since @xmath45 we have @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , notice the following useful formulas @xcite : @xmath47 and @xmath48 finally , it is easy to calculate that @xmath49 the question about existence and uniqueness of solution to ( [ eqpolar ] ) is answered by the following theorem which uses picard - lindeloeff iterations .    define the approximation sequence by @xmath50    @xmath51    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the sequence @xmath54 is uniformly convergent to the unique solution of boundary value problem ( [ eqpolar])-([boundary ] ) provided that @xmath55 [ exuniq ]    first , observe that p is lipschitz continuous : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 .",
    "we can write ( [ eqint ] ) and ( [ eqint ] ) as @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath60}(t ) + t v_0(t)v_1(r ) \\chi_{[0,r]}(t ) \\right ) , \\\\      g(r , t):=\\frac{b}{i_0(\\sqrt{a})}\\left ( t v'_0(r)v_1(t ) \\chi_{[1,r]}(t ) + t v_0(t)v'_1(r ) \\chi_{[0,r]}(t ) \\right ) . \\end{split}\\ ] ] it is an easy calculation using ( [ rv])-([pochodne ] ) to show that @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where @xmath63    let @xmath64 and similarly @xmath65 .",
    "we have to show that these series are uniformly convergent when @xmath66 . by estimate @xmath67 and",
    "generally @xmath68 we get @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is a supremum norm .",
    "moreover , @xmath71 that is @xmath72 . by the assumption @xmath73",
    ", so the dominant number series are uniformly convergent . from uniform cauchy - sequence argument , @xmath74 and @xmath75 for some @xmath76 .",
    "the equality @xmath77 follows from continuity of @xmath7 and ( [ hn ] ) .",
    "this ends the proof .    imposing more restrictions on @xmath27 we can prove some estimates for the solution to ( [ eqpolar ] ) .",
    "assume that @xmath78 , then @xmath79 [ lemest ]    take @xmath27 as in the assumptions . by ( [ bessel])-([eqint ] ) and since @xmath80",
    "we have the estimate @xmath81 now , by ( [ rv ] ) and our assumption on @xmath27 we deduce that @xmath82 next , by similar reasoning we have @xmath83 we have shown that @xmath84 , thus by ( [ eqv ] ) @xmath85 where @xmath86 . finally , from ( [ rv ] ) and ( [ p ] ) we deduce that @xmath87 similarly , estimating from below we can prove @xmath88 therefore we have proved our claims .",
    "let @xmath78 .",
    "solution of the problem ( [ eqpolar])-([boundary ] ) is a positive , nonincreasing function @xmath8 with @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are defined by ( [ h0])-([hn ] ) , while @xmath92 [ estimates ]    lemma [ lemest ] gives us the fact that @xmath8 is nonincreasing .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath93 .",
    "simple calculus allows us to deduce that @xmath94 . now using the equation for @xmath8 ( [ eqint ] ) we can conclude the proof .",
    "various estimates on @xmath8 are depicted on figure [ estpic ] .",
    "the convergence of @xmath54 is very fast .",
    "in fact , only after 4 iterations we have @xmath95 .",
    "although picard s iterations can be very demanding on computer power they converge very rapidly hence the number of iterations can be kept small .    to provide validity of theorem @xmath96 and corollary [ estimates ] we have to restrict the values of @xmath27 .",
    "nevertheless , we will see in the next section that values of @xmath97 calculated from the data lie in the admissible region .",
    "figure [ ab ] shows the assumed restrictions on @xmath27 .",
    "assumed in theorem [ exuniq ] and corollary [ estimates ] .",
    "solid line : @xmath98 . dashed line : @xmath99 . ]",
    "in this section we present the results of data fitting . instead of exact solution of ( [ eqpolar ] )",
    "we will use its zeroth - order approximation @xmath90 which is defined by ( [ h0 ] ) .",
    "the use of @xmath90 rather than @xmath8 is equivalent to making the assumption that the pressure acts in the @xmath14-direction as apposed to the normal direction .",
    "moreover , @xmath90 has a simple analytic form and hence is much easier to use in applications",
    ".    we will determine constants @xmath26 and @xmath27 by taking two measurements : cornea s maximum deflection and central radius of curvature .",
    "these two values are readily measurable quantities and allow us to make a fit on the whole domain .",
    "suppose we know maximum deflection @xmath100 and central radius of curvature @xmath101 , where @xmath102 . because @xmath103 we have @xmath104 , thus @xmath105 where in calculating the second derivative we used @xmath106 ( see @xcite ) . finally , using ( [ h0 ] )",
    "we deduce that @xmath26 is the solution of the following equation @xmath107 for two datasets consisting of @xmath108 points representing interior and exterior surfaces of the cornea we calculated that @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "it is evident that these points are within the admissible region depicted on fig .",
    "[ ab ] .    to make the fitting more accurate we can resign from assumed radial symmetry by making a slight perturbation in the domain @xmath9 .",
    "specificly , as @xmath9 we will use ellipse instead of a circle .",
    "the eccentricity of this ellipse can be calculated from the data , for example , by measuring the eccentricity of level curves of the corneal shape . in order to reshape our @xmath9 into an ellipse we have to change @xmath113 into @xmath114 , where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are semiaxes of the ellipse in the domain .",
    "mean fitting errors for interior and exterior surfaces are respectively @xmath117 @xmath118 and @xmath119 @xmath120 and squared eccentricities are @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the interior surface is thus slightly prolate while exterior is oblate .",
    "it is evident that deviations from circular shape are very minute .",
    "the magnitude of absolute fitting error is shown on fig .",
    "[ 3d ] .",
    "another important feature of cornea s geometry is its curvature . for measuring radius of curvature optometrists",
    "use the following quantity known as axial distance ( @xcite ) @xmath123 in the case of surface of revolution , normal vector lies in the meridional plane so @xmath124 is the distance along the normal vector from the surface point to the axis of revolution . the absolute error in fitting @xmath124 calculated for our @xmath90",
    "is depicted on fig .",
    "mean errors are approximately @xmath125 @xmath126 and @xmath127 @xmath128 for interior and exterior surfaces respecively .",
    "we have proposed a nonlinear mathematical model of corneal geometry based on a thin membrane equation .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of the solution was proved provided that one of the parameters was bounded in respect the the other .",
    "various estimates ( lemma [ lemest ] and corollary [ estimates ] ) showed that the solution behaves according to common physical intuition . approximating sequence ( [ hn ] )",
    "converges very rapidly to the exact solution what can be deduced from its definition and numerical experiments .",
    "we have fitted zeroth - order approximation @xmath90 to the two meshes of @xmath108 points representing interior and exterior surfaces of cornea .",
    "we have slightly perturbed its radial symmetry according to the measurable quantities .",
    "the mean fitting error was of order of a few per cent which provided a good fit .",
    "the error was slightly smaller for exterior than interior surface .",
    "also , the function known as axial distance representing cornea s radius of curvature was in a good accordance with the data . again , the magnitude of errors were of order of a few per cent what allows us to conclude that this is a good result for a model of that simplicity .",
