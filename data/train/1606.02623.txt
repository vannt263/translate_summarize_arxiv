    "recently there has been considerable interest in the study of extremizers , optimal constants , and sharp instances of various fourier extension inequalities .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is three - fold .",

    "secondly , we use concentration - compactness tools to study the qualitative behavior of extremizing sequences for this sharp inequality .",
    "thirdly , we explore the link between fourier extension inequalities and strichartz estimates for certain higher order schrdinger equations , and resolve some dichotomies concerning the existence of extremizers that have appeared in the recent literature . + throughout the paper , we normalize the fourier transform as follows : @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the usual inner product in @xmath3 . given a sufficiently nice function @xmath4 ,",
    "consider the hypersurface in @xmath5 @xmath6 endowed with projection measure @xmath7 which in turn is defined by requiring that the identity @xmath8 holds for every schwartz function @xmath9 .",
    "the fourier extension operator for the hypersurface @xmath10 is defined as @xmath11 estimates for this operator stem from the seminal works of tomas @xcite , stein @xcite and strichartz @xcite . in particular , under certain fairly general convexity assumptions on @xmath0 , the inequality @xmath12 holds in dimensions @xmath13 , see e.g. @xcite . to pursue this point further ,",
    "let us specialize the discussion to the two - dimensional case @xmath14 .",
    "using the fact that in this case the exponent @xmath15 is an even integer together with plancherel s theorem , the inequality @xmath16 can be rewritten in bilinear convolution form as @xmath17 we emphasize that , since the surface @xmath10 is not compact , inequality does not hold in general if the projection measure is replaced by the usual surface measure on @xmath10 .",
    "inequality will be established under some mild assumptions on @xmath0 in theorem [ main ] below .",
    "as we will see , it will follow from the fact that the convolution @xmath18 defines a measure which is absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure on @xmath19 , and whose radon  nikodym derivative is given by an essentially bounded function . + in the first part of the paper",

    "@xcite identify a monotonicity property of such integrals under a certain quadratic heat - flow .",
    "these proofs rely on the large symmetry group enjoyed by the paraboloid .",
    "perturbed paraboloids @xmath10 with @xmath30 no longer enjoy this special feature , and understanding the associated fourier extension operator in sharp form is an important step towards the understanding of general manifolds with positive gaussian curvature .",
