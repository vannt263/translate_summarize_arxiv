    "narrow gap semiconductors with non - trivial topological invariants ( @xmath1)@xcite are currently stimulating intense research activity in condensed matter physics and materials science driven by their conceptual novelties as well as potential for applications . in these novel materials , known as topological insulators ( tis),@xcite the bulk system is insulating , but the surfaces support metallic states with linear energy dispersion like a massless dirac fermion .",
    "these dirac fermions possess a helical spin - texture in * k*-space , are protected by time - reversal symmetry ( trs),@xcite and are not allowed to backscatter in the absence of magnetic impurities or other trs breaking perturbations .",
    "these unique properties of the dirac states in the tis provide an exciting playground for the realization of many topological quantum phenomena in a table - top setting , and as a basis for next generation electronic devices.@xcite    among the various known families of three dimensional ( 3d ) tis , bi@xmath0se@xmath2 and bi@xmath0te@xmath2@xcite have been the workhorse materials , which have been used widely for investigating topological states and their properties .",
    "they possess a relatively simple crystal structure composed of stacks of five - atomic - layer - blocks or quintuple blocks ( qbs ) .",
    "the qbs are held together by weak van der waals forces , providing natural cleavage planes without breaking strong bonds,@xcite and are theoretically predicted to support only non - trivial dirac cone states without the presence of trivial dangling bond states , in agreement with the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) results.@xcite along these lines , surfaces of qbs are normally assumed to be the termination surfaces in the binary bi - based class of tis and other layered materials . @xcite    the thallium - based ternary semiconductors tlbise@xmath0 and tlbite@xmath0 , which are of particular interest to this study , were first predicted theoretically to be 3d - tis , before the topological character of these materials was demonstrated experimentally.@xcite although the crystal structure of these tis is layered , it does not possess a weakly coupled pair of layers .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission experiments show that tlbise@xmath0 and tlbite@xmath0 support a single dirac cone surface state .",
    "@xcite the dirac node in tlbise@xmath0 lies within the bulk energy gap of 0.2@xmath30.3 ev , and it is well isolated from the bulk bands . as a result , the helical spin - texture of",
    "both the upper and the lower dirac cone in tlbise@xmath0 is accessible and , in fact , this is the first ti in which a chirality inversion from the surface state spin - texture was observed experimentally.@xcite the velocity of the dirac carriers in tlbise@xmath0 is higher than bi@xmath0se@xmath2.@xcite furthermore , it has been reported that bulk tlbite@xmath0 becomes superconducting with p - doping ( carrier density @xmath4 holes/@xmath5).@xcite reference shows that the fermi level at this doping lies @xmath6 150 mev below the bulk conduction bands where six leaf - like bulk hole pockets appear in the surface brillouin zone along with the topological surface state .",
    "these results suggest that bulk superconductivity in p - type tlbite@xmath0 originates from the six leaf - like bulk hole pockets and thus , in this state , it may be possible for the surface dirac cone to become superconducting due to the proximity of bulk superconductivity,@xcite making tlbite@xmath0 a possible host material for topological superconductivity .",
    "the preceding discussion makes it clear that tlbise@xmath0 and tlbite@xmath0 are interesting ti materials . the cleavage plane in these crystals , however , is not obvious due to the strong ionic - covalent - type bonding among the different atomic layers .",
    "theoretical studies predict the presence of trivial dangling bond states along with the dirac cone states over various flat se(te)- as well as tl - terminated surfaces;@xcite the trivial surface states have not been observed experimentally , even though dirac cone states are clearly visible in the bulk energy gap .",
    "recent scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) and core level - photoelectron spectroscopy ( cl - pes ) studies of tlbise@xmath0 @xcite indicate that the flat surface assumed in theoretical modeling may not be a realistic representation of the actual cleaved surface ; tlbise@xmath0 surface is found to exhibit a complicated morphology involving a se - terminated surface covered with islands of tl atoms with roughly a 50:50 coverage of se and tl terminations .",
    "such a surface with an equal number of se ( anion ) and tl ( cation ) atoms would be nonpolar like the ( 001 ) and ( 110 ) surfaces of recently discovered topological crystalline insulator snte,@xcite and result in the saturation of the trivial dangling bond states . despite this experimental evidence ,",
    "we are not aware of any first - principles study exploring such non - polar surfaces of tlbise(te)@xmath0 , which might also give insight into why the predicted trivial dangling bond states are not observed experimentally .    with this motivation ,",
    "we have carried out systematic _ ab - initio _ electronic structure calculations using a variety of surface terminations for both tlbise@xmath0 and tlbite@xmath0 .",
    "when we consider an essentially nonpolar surface with an equal number of se / te and tl atoms in the surface layer , as proposed in ref . , we not only obtain dirac cone states placed clearly within the bulk band gap in both tlbise@xmath0 and tlbite@xmath0 , but we also find that the trivial dangling bond states now disappear .",
    "moreover , the computed dirac band dispersions in tlbise@xmath0 as well as tlbite@xmath0 for the nonpolar surfaces reproduce the corresponding experimental dispersions in remarkable detail .",
    "finally , we explore the high - index ( 221 ) and ( 112 ) surfaces of the present compounds .",
    "the trivial states on the flat ( 221 ) and ( 112 ) se - terminated surfaces of tlbise@xmath0 are found to be shifted energetically to lie below the dirac node , and here also the dirac cone states become well isolated from the bulk as well as the trivial surface states .",

    "however , the surface atoms for t1 as well as t2 termination in both compounds maintain their in - plane positions without a tendency for reconstructions , reflecting presumably the highly directional nature of the bonding of the surface atoms with the underlying layers .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , there are significant relaxation effects with atoms experiencing out - of - the - plane displacements ; the distance between the first two top layers contracts , while that between the second and third layers expands with this pattern of alternating contraction and expansion decaying as one goes deeper into the bulk .",
    "specifically , the distance between the first two layers in tlbise@xmath0 ( tlbite@xmath0 ) contracts by 0.09 ( 0.11 ) and 0.22 ( 0.19 ) for t1 and t2 terminations , respectively ; the corresponding increases in the distance between the second and third layers is 0.11 ( 0.18 ) and 0.12 ( 0.13 ) for t1 and t2 .    turning to t3 termination , we modeled this complicated surface by taking a @xmath42 supercell of a tl - terminated slab in which we removed tl atoms from half of the surface layer as shown in fig .",

    "the absence of trivial states in t3 may be attributed to the stoichiometric slab configuration ( @xmath41 ) where we have a nonpolar surface geometry with an equal number of tl@xmath12 and se@xmath13 layers . since the dangling bond states are localized on tl and se surface atomic layers , the strong ionic nature of bonding between tl and se atoms",

    "we have computed the total energies of slabs with various terminations .",
    "note that slabs with different terminations contain different numbers of atoms and , therefore , their energies can not be compared directly .",

    "the existence of dirac cone states over the ( 221 ) surface of tlbise@xmath0 , which are well isolated from the bulk as well as the trivial dangling bond states , suggests that other high - index surfaces might also support such a behavior .",
    "accordingly , we have investigated another high - index surface , namely , the ( 112 ) surface .",
    "the ( 112 ) surface has an atomic structure similar to that of the ( 221 ) surface , although in this case the normal distance between the top four atomic layers is quite small [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:112surface](a ) ] . as a result ,",
    "the anion and cation layers lie close to the surface , and we might expect that the strong bonding between these layers will remove the trivial dangling bonds .",
    "this is indeed what happens as seen clearly in fig .",

    "[ fig:221surface](a ) , with anisotropic energy dispersions and velocities of dirac carriers .",
    "this anisotropy is a direct consequence of the reduced symmetry of these surfaces , and results in novel direction dependent properties of the carriers , which would potentially allow manipulation and engineering of new materials platforms for magneto - electronic devices such as anisotropic - magnetic - sensors,@xcite and use in table - top experiments to simulate high energy particles propagating in anisotropic space.@xcite other applications based on differences in carrier velocities at the interfaces of surfaces have been suggested.@xcite",
    "we have investigated the electronic structures associated with various surface terminations of tlbise@xmath0 and tlbite@xmath0 slabs within the framework of the first - principles density functional theory .",
    "the dirac cone states are found to coexist with the trivial dangling bond states for flat ( polar ) se / te- or tl- terminated surfaces in sharp disagreement with arpes experiments on tlbise@xmath0 and tlbite@xmath0 where no trivial states are observed near the fermi energy .",
    "we show that for a rough ( non - polar ) ( 111 ) surface with an equal number of tl and se ( te ) atoms in the surface layer of tlbise(te)@xmath0 , the trivial dangling bond states are removed , leaving a well - isolated dirac cone in the bulk band gap in remarkable accord with the experimental results .",
    "the computed spin - texture of the dirac states is helical with large in - plane polarization , which is also in agreement with the results of available spin - resolved arpes experiments .",
    "our study suggests that a rough , nonpolar surface model , such as the t3-termination model , is a viable model of the naturally occurring surfaces of tlbise@xmath0 and tlbite@xmath0 .",
    "finally , we consider tlbise@xmath0 and tlbite@xmath0 slabs with flat , ( 221 ) and ( 112 ) surfaces , and find that the trivial surface states in this case also tend to move away from the energy region of the bulk band gap , suggesting an alternate route for obtaining dirac cones which are well - isolated from the bulk and other trivial surface states . notably , in contrast to the nearly isotropic dirac states supported by the ( 111 ) surfaces of tlbise@xmath0 and tlbite@xmath0 , the ( 221 ) surface dirac states are more anisotropic , presenting interesting possibilities for fundamental physics as well as applications .",
