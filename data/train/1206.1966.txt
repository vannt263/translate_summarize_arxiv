    "neutrinos have played an important role in the evolution of particle physics , and nowadays the explanation of some of their properties is one of the main goals of models beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in the sm",
    ", there are three flavours of massless neutrinos , which take part in the charged and neutral current weak interaction , and the states that describe different flavour neutrinos are left - handed ( lh ) , orthogonal , and form a @xmath0 doublet with the corresponding charged lepton field @xcite .",
    "the existence of three different flavours is a well - established experimental fact , and from existing data it is concluded that they are always produced in weak interaction processes in a state that is predominantly left - handed .",
    "we do not have compelling evidence for the existence of predominantly right - handed neutrinos , and therefore conclude that they should be _ sterile _ , i.e. that their interaction with matter should be much weaker than the weak interaction of lh neutrinos .",
    "formally , this could be expressed by describing the rh neutrino as a @xmath0 singlet . in extensions of the sm ,",
    "rh neutrinos serve in the explanation of masses and mixing , as well as the disparity between neutrino and charged lepton and quarks mass scales , and the generation of matter - antimatter asymmetry .",
    "experiments with solar , atmospheric and reactor neutrinos provide evidence of neutrino oscillations , caused by non - zero mass and mixing matrices @xcite .",
    "formally , this means that the lh flavour neutrino fields @xmath1 which enter the expression for the lepton current in the cc weak interaction lagrangian ( _ weak eigenstates _ ) , are linear combinations of three or more fields @xmath2 with masses @xmath3 ( _ mass eigenstates _ ) , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a unitary matrix ( pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata pmns matrix ) .",
    "almost all existing data can be described with at least three light neutrinos , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , but the existence of additional , sterile neutrinos is not ruled out .    in order to give an explanation to the smallness of neutrino masses , basically two types of models",
    "have been attempted : seesaw and radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "the seesaw mechanism is often denoted as the most elegant scheme @xcite , and relies in the violation of lepton number at a very high energy scale ( @xmath8 ) , giving a mass with the form @xmath9 .",
    "there are three basic ways of realizing this mechanism : with a heavy right - handed majorana neutrino coupled to @xmath10 via the sm scalar doublet ( canonical , or type i seesaw ) ; with a heavy scalar triplet ( type ii ) , or a heavy fermionic triplet ( type iii ) . since the mass scale @xmath8 associated with the new fields is very high ( @xmath11 gev ) , these models have the huge disadvantage of not being accessible to experiments .    in the last few years",
    ", there have been numerous attempts of accommodating the seesaw mechanism in models in the tev scale , which could be probed in lhc .",
    "some of these models are based on the @xmath12 gauge symmetry , and are called 331 models for short . since the sm 321 group is a subgroup of 331 , it is possible to account for the known phenomenology , and try to fit new effects in the windows for new physics .",
    "one of the motivations of these models is the explanation of the origin of generations , and the prediction of charge quantization for three - family models .",
    "however , even after imposing restrictions , specially the cancellation of anomalies , there remains a free parameter @xmath13 and therefore it is not possible to identify a unique version of a 331 model .",
    "neutrino masses have been treated before in 331 models as radiative corrections , or including a scalar sextet which leads to majorana mass terms @xcite .",
    "many of these , particularly those with a scalar sextet , have the characteristic of including doubly - charged higgs bosons , which may or may not be observed experimentally . working with a sextet",
    "has a couple of down - sides , namely the huge amount of extra parameters , and the inclusion of a @xmath14 triplet with a very large mass . in this work ,",
    "we show an alternative for generating neutrino mass matrices in a 331 model with @xmath15 , which does not involve any exotic charges , neither in the fermionic nor in the scalar sector . with the addition of 331-singlet neutrinos , one can find light neutrino masses within the sub - ev range via the so - called inverse , double and linear seesaw mechanisms @xcite .    the article is organized as follows : in section [ elements ] , we review the basics of @xmath16 models , and mention previous works that address neutrino masses with this symmetry . in section [ model ] , we focus on our particular version , presenting both the scalar and fermionic sector , and the lagrangian that leads to the three different scenarios for neutrino masses . in appendix [ diag ]",
    "we show the procedure for the diagonalization of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "in order to construct a gauge model based on the group @xmath17 , first of all we need to ensure that it describes the electromagnetic interaction , which is done demanding that the sector @xmath18 contains the subgroup @xmath19 .",
    "the generator @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are diagonal generators of @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the quantum number associated to @xmath26 and is related to the free parameter @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "however , it is not possible to identify a unique version of a 331 model . some conditions that we have to impose on the model , and",
    "that will restrict the possible values for @xmath13 are : that it contains at least the phenomenological particles ( with all their degrees of freedom ) and the interactions among them , that the anomalies cancel ( so that it is a renormalizable theory ) , that the scalar sector must allow a ssb according to the scheme @xmath27 , and that the extra particles are heavier than the sm ones .",
    "one way of choosing @xmath13 is defining the electric charge of the exotic ( beyond the sm ) particles .",
    "quarks ( @xmath28 ) and leptons ( @xmath29 ) can be in the following representations : @xmath30 where the notation @xmath31 , @xmath32 corresponds to the embedding of the sm particles and @xmath33 , @xmath34 is associated to particles beyond the sm . both possibilities @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath24 multiplets are included in the flavor sector since the same number of fermion triplets and antitriplets must be present in order to cancel anomalies .",
    "one way to achieve this is choosing two quark families in one irreducible representation @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) and the other family of quarks and the three leptonic families in the representation @xmath36 ( @xmath35 ) . this way we guarantee a vector representation of fermions with respect to the @xmath24 group , i.e. a model free of chiral anomalies .",
    "gauge bosons associated to the group @xmath24 transform according to the adjoint representation : @xmath37 the gauge field associated to @xmath38 is represented as @xmath39 we have three gauge fields with @xmath40 ( that combine to form the photon and @xmath41 , @xmath42 bosons ) , two fields with @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and four fields with charges that depend on the choice of @xmath13 ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) , with @xmath47 finally , the ssb follows the scheme @xmath48 the transitions leave one massless gauge boson ( photon ) , and eight massive ( three weak and five exotic ) . the generators that should be broken each time impose a restriction over the possible scalar fields .",
    "also , since we need yukawa terms to give masses to the fermions , and such terms must be 331 invariant , we find that the scalar fields @xmath49 can be in the representations @xmath50 , @xmath36 , or @xmath35 .",
    "the choice of @xmath13 , as well as the particle content ( specially the scalar sector ) , and the possibility of imposing additional discrete symmetries , leads to a variety of 331 models .",
    "since our object of study is the problem of neutrino masses , we will now briefly review some versions and how they explain them .      in @xcite , a model with three scalar triplets @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , a leptonic triplet including right - handed charged fields @xmath55 and an additional heavy charged lepton singlet @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "gives massive charged fields in the tree level , and neutrino mass matrix appears at the 1-loop level . with an extra neutral singlet @xmath58 , there are new terms in the mass matrix from the tree - level .",
    "the model in @xcite contains the same fields as the previous one ( the three scalar triplets and the fermionic field @xmath59 ) , with the addition of a sextet @xmath60the yukawa couplings with the fields @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the ones that give rise to majorana mass terms ; the ratio @xmath63 controls the relation between neutrino and charged lepton masses .      in the 331 model with @xmath65 flavour symmetry",
    "@xcite , we have the leptons @xmath66 @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and the scalar sector",
    "@xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 , and they transform as @xmath76 , @xmath77 , under a @xmath78 symmetry .",
    "the charged leptons gain masses from the yukawa interactions of the @xmath79 triplet @xmath80 , while quarks may gain masses either from @xmath80 ( which leads to a ckm matrix equal to unity at first approximation ) , or from @xmath61 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "the yukawa couplings with @xmath83 lead to a neutrino mass matrix @xmath84 where @xmath85 have the usual form , as does the effective mass matrix for the active neutrinos @xmath86 , which is a combination of type i and type ii seesaw mechanisms .",
    "the model in @xcite also considers the symmetry @xmath65 , but with a different particle content .",
    "we have @xmath88 , @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 , where @xmath92 are negatively charged heavy leptons , and although the inclusion of right - handed neutral weyl states @xmath93 is optional , they are used for the realization of tree - level canonical seesaw mechanism . in the scalar sector , we have @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 . the active neutrino mass matrix is @xmath99 . with @xmath100",

    "the neutrinos do not achive mass in the tree level , but via radiative corrections .",
    "the models in @xcite have the same content as above , with the addition of a scalar sextet @xmath111 this allows the obtention of tree - level mass terms , and leads to the effective mass for the active neutrinos @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the yukawa coupling of the lepton triplets with the sextet , and @xmath114 the coupling with @xmath82 .",

    "@xmath134 plus the condition @xmath135 ; however , it leads to a poorer yukawa sector which is defeating to the goal of this work and thus will not be implemented . for the sake of simplicity , we only present the mass eigenstates for the potential ( [ v00 ] ) in table [ scalart ] @xcite , keeping in mind that adding ( [ v13 ] ) does not have significant implications for the main results of following sections .",

    "notice that the majorana mass , @xmath142 , is non - restricted so far ; it could be in a smaller or larger scale than the vev s .",
    "nevertheless , the diagonalization of the matrix @xmath8 as presented leads in first approximation to a light neutrino mass @xmath143    notice that both terms depend on the antisymmetric matrix @xmath144 , therefore , the symmetries in the lagrangian must be such that the yukawa coupling term between @xmath10 and @xmath58 does not cancel .",
    "furthermore , it should not be symmetric . on the other hand , we can set to zero the 13 entry of the mass matrix by using a discrete symmetry and we would still have tree - level masses for the lightest neutrinos .",
    "the matrix @xmath142 sets a scale for the breaking of lepton number ; if @xmath145 then the fields @xmath146 and @xmath147 could acquire vevs @xcite , say , @xmath148 @xmath149 .",
    "their values are restricted since they are also involved in the mixing among the exotic quarks and ordinary quarks of the same charge , thus in flavor - changing neutral - current processes ; to keep a consistency with the effective theory , it is safe to impose the constraints @xmath150 @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "now , for neutrino masses , to include these terms we would have to do the substitutions @xmath152 @xmath153 in ( [ general ] ) . since we expect yukawa matrices to be roughly of the same order , in cases where we keep the terms with both @xmath154 and @xmath155 ( such as cases 1 and 3 below ) , we can safeley neglect the extra terms . now",

    "therefore , we can safely assume that the presence of the small expectation values does not affect the results for neutrino masses in any of the cases considered .",

    "one charged , two neutral fields ) and two singlets ( one charged , one neutral ) for each family , we find that neutrinos may acquire tiny masses via the double , inverse or linear seesaw mechanisms .",
    "according to the selection of the majorana mass term @xmath142 for the singlet neutrino and additional discrete symmetries , we have three different scenarios for the exotic neutrinos : for large @xmath142 , three sterile neutrinos ( @xmath161 ) are in an intermediate scale ( e.g. @xmath215 gev ) , and other three ( @xmath162 ) in a heavier scale ( @xmath216 gev ) ; for small @xmath142 we have three pairs of pseudo - dirac neutrinos in the tev scale ; and for @xmath217 they combine to form three dirac neutrinos with masses in the tev scale as well .",
