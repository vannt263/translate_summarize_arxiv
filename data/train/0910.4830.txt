    "planet mars is a typical target for exploring the possibility that life arose in a planet different than earth .",
    "its present surface conditions are very inhospitables , if compared with most of the terrestrial environments , but several lifeforms have shown a strong capability to adapt to very harsh conditions and to survive even for some period in circumterrestrial space .",
    "if life , similar or different from the terrestrial one , existed on mars in the past , some life forms could have adapted to the climate changes and could have survived in some ecologic niche , near the soil or deep under the surface . moreover , while exploring mars , we may incidentally or voluntary drop terrestrial lifeforms , able to survive and to be reactivated once brought back in laboratories .",
    "finding conditions that allow the survival of lifeforms in a martian environment can have a double value : increasing the hope of finding extraterrestrial life and defining the limits for a terrestrial contamination of planet mars .",
    "in order to understand if some lifeforms may have survived on mars , we conceived and built two simulators of its environments @xcite where to perform researches with bacteria strains : lisa ( laboratorio italiano simulazione ambienti ) , that allows six simultaneous experiments , and a single - experiment version of it ( mini - lisa ) .",
    "our lisa environmental chambers may reproduce the conditions of many martian locations near the surface ( temperature ranging from 133k to 293k , atmospheric composition with the 95% of co2 at a pressure between 6 and 9 mb , strong uv radiation ) .",
    "since we use a 500 liters reservoir of liquid nitrogen , refuelled once per week , experiments not longer than 25 hours may be performed inside lisa , while in mini - lisa there is theoretically no time limit .",
    "we proceeded keeping in mind two important caveats : first , we do nt have ( yet ) neither martian bacteria nor martian soils to use for the tests , and so we must use terrestrial surrogates .",
    "second , lifeforms on a different planet may have a fully different combination of nucleic acids and aminoacids , so our conclusions could be fully wrong if applied to a `` martian life '' . however , they are useful for contamination- or terraforming- studies .    inside our simulators",
    "we have studied the survival of several bacterial strains belonging to the genus _ deinococcus _ , and to the endospore forming genera _ bacillus _ and _ clostridium_. cellular or endospores suspensions were layered on sterile coverslip dehydrated under sterile air flux , introduced in dedicated plates and then exposed to a pressure of 7.5 mbar of co@xmath0 and to @xmath14 w m@xmath2 of uvc light .",
    "we simulated both `` martian summer day '' ( 23 @xmath3c ) and `` winter day''(-80 @xmath3c ) conditions for several hours .",
    "in our experiments , we found that desiccation effect ( water escape because of low pressure ) may strongly decrease the survival of vegetative cells , but not of spores .",
    "in martian environment , uv light appears to have the most cytocidal effect , while atmospheric gases or temperature are not relevant to the survival of cells or spores .",
    "vegetative cells are inactivated by uv light in a few minutes , while spores may survive for hours ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "two of our _ bacillus _ strains , _",
    "b. pumilus _ and _ b. nealsonii _ , have a particular capability to survive in martian conditions without being screened by dust or other shields . as endospores suspension , they survive at least 4 hours and in some cases up to 28 hours in martian conditions .",
    "we simulated the dust coverage happening on the real planet by blowing on the samples a very smaller quantity of grain of volcanic ash or dust of red iron oxide .",
    "samples covered by these dust grains have shown a high percentage of survival , indicating that under the surface dust , if life was present on mars in the past , some bacteria cell could still be present .",
    "we would like to acknowledge the air liquide italy - north east region for kindly providing us the liquid nitrogen as support of this research .",
    "this work has been funded by the university of padua funds ( ex 60% ) ."
