    "in this section , we discuss the main features of the t=0 dielectric response of sr@xmath115tio@xmath116 and its relationship to that of srtio@xmath10 .",
    "we show that the anisotropy and sensitivity to changes in the lattice constants through epitaxial strain and thermal expansion can be understood by focusing on the ti - o chains and chain fragments .",
    "finally , we discuss the comparison of the results of our calculations to available experimental data .",
    "as noted in the previous section , the static dielectric tensor of sr@xmath115tio@xmath116 is rather anisotropic , with the response in the planes of the layers about three times greater than the response perpendicular to the layers .",
    "this can be understood by analyzing the ti - o chains . in srtio@xmath10 , the large dielectric response",
    "can be directly linked to the presence of infinite ti - o chains running in all three cartesian directions , with anomalously large born effective charges and low frequencies for modes with ti displacing relative to o along the chain  @xcite ( see table  [ table : srtio3 ] ) . in sr@xmath0tio@xmath1",
    "the infinite ti - o chains lying in the tio@xmath0 planes are preserved , while the ti - o chains along [ 001 ] are broken into short o - ti - o segments by the relative shift of the sro - terminated perovskite slabs ( see figure  [ fig : struct](c ) ) .",
    "correspondingly , as can be seen in table  [ table : becs ] the @xmath74 s in sr@xmath0tio@xmath1 for ti and o displacing along the infinite chains in the tio@xmath115 layers , @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) and @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) , are only slightly smaller than those of srtio@xmath10 .",
    "@xcite in contrast , the breaking of the ti - o chains into o - ti - o segments along [ 001 ] has a dramatic effect on the anomalous component of the ti and o born effective charges for motion along the segment , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , reducing them by over a factor of 2 . while it is true that the local anisotropy caused by the somewhat larger ti - o@xmath28 bond length compared with the ti - o@xmath27 bond length will also reduce the corresponding born effective charges ,",
    "this is a much weaker effect as suggested by the following calculation .",
    "we fixed the ti - o@xmath28 distance to that of the ti - o@xmath27 bond length of structure ( b ) ( where the in - plane plane lattice parameter was fixed to the lattice constant of srtio@xmath5 ) , creating a structure whereby the ti - o distances are equal in all three cartesian directions .",
    "the born effective charges along [ 001 ] were found to increase , but only slightly ( @xmath84=5.29 and @xmath85=-3.80 ) .    this reduction of the anomalous component of the born effective charges is quite similar to the reduction of the @xmath74 s observed in batio@xmath5 due to the ferroelectric transition .",
    "indeed , ghosez _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found that @xmath121 and @xmath122 in cubic batio@xmath5 while in the tetragonal phase they found @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "it was explained that this reduction of the @xmath74 s going from the cubic to the tetragonal phase resulted from the displacement of the ti atom along the ferrroelectric axis , resulting in a series of long - short ti - o bonds thereby  breaking \" the ti - o chains .",
    "@xcite in sr@xmath0tio@xmath1 this breaking of the ti - o chains can be thought of as being caused not by alternating ti - o bond lengths along a given direction , but by the shift of the sro - terminated srtio@xmath5 slabs , resulting in a sro - sro anti - phase boundary perpendicular to [ 001 ] as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : struct ] . finally , this breaking of the chains in sr@xmath0tio@xmath1 is arguably a much  stronger \" effect than the cubic to tetragonal transition in batio@xmath5 , as evidenced by the greater reduction of the born effective charges along [ 001 ] .",
    "the breaking of the [ 001 ] ti - o chains into segments lowers the dielectric response relative to srtio@xmath10 also by stiffening the low - frequency mode associated with relative displacement of ti and o along the chains .",
    "the in - plane @xmath127 ( to1 ) mode in sr@xmath115tio@xmath116 for the fully relaxed structure ( a ) is at 148 @xmath94 ( 134 @xmath94 for the structure with in - plane lattice constant fixed to srtio@xmath5 ( b ) ) comparable to our calculated value of 103 @xmath94 for srtio@xmath10 , while the corresponding out - of - plane @xmath128 ( to2 ) mode is at 378 @xmath94 for structure ( a ) ( 391 @xmath94 for structure ( b ) ) . as we discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the large anisotropy is almost completely accounted for by the large @xmath50 of the in - plane @xmath127 ( to1 ) mode as shown in table  [ table : modchrg ] .",
    "the topology of the ti - o chains thus appears to be much more important than the bond lengths and the details of the geometry .",
    "indeed , our calculations show that the dielectric permittivity tensor of sr@xmath0tio@xmath1 is not very sensitive to an in - plane tensile strain . from table  [",
    "table : die ] we see that @xmath112 for the fully - relaxed structure ( a ) and for the structure with the in - plane lattice constant constrained to the theoretical srtio@xmath5 value ( b ) only differ by @xmath11115@xmath70 .",
    "also , we see that this difference originates from the component of @xmath109 along in - plane directions while the lattice contribution to the dielectric permittivity tensor along [ 001 ] remains relatively constant .",
    "in particular , we see that @xmath109 along directions in which the ti - o chains were preserved is relatively more sensitive to a fixed strain than along directions in which these chains were broken . in fact this sensitivity can be attributed to a single e@xmath103 mode where it can be seen that the sum of the contributions to @xmath109 from the remaining e@xmath129 modes remains nearly constant for all the structures considered . as was pointed out in sec .",
    "[ sec : die ] this e@xmath103 mode also contributes predominately to the rather large anisotropy of the static dielectric permittivity tensor .",
    "thus , the difference in response between fully coherent and fully relaxed films is expected to be relatively insignificant , unlike the case of epitaxial thin films of srtio@xmath5 , in which the induced strain would influence the lattice dynamics and presumably could have significant effect on the dielectric properties .",
    "@xcite in addition , this insensitivity should reduce the tcf , especially for @xmath130 .",
    "anisotropy of the dielectric tensor has not been previously experimentally determined in sr@xmath115tio@xmath116 , though measurements have been carried out for single crystals of some isostructural oxides cayalo@xmath1 , candalo@xmath1 , and lasralo@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite in the latter case , the anisotropy is very small ( and in the case of lasralo@xmath1 , the out - of - plane component of the dielectric tensor , @xmath130= 20.02 , is slightly greater than the in - plane component @xmath131= @xmath132=16.81 ) .",
    "the absence of a large in - plane response in these materials highlights the unique physics of the ti - o chain .",
    "the anisotropy of the dielectric tensor is an important factor to be taken into consideration when comparing the computed dielectric response with experiment , and indeed in correctly interpreting experimental measurements .",
    "for ceramics , anisotropy of the single crystal response can give a range of values for the measured dielectric response , depending on the size , shape and interaction of the grains .",
    "in the single crystal films , the anisotropy complicates the interpretation of the microwave microscope method of determining the dielectric response .",
    "the effective dielectric constant obtained by this technique is in fact an average of the dielectric tensor components determined by the field distribution near the probe , which is itself determined by the anisotropic dielectric response .",
    "while an exact value requires detailed modeling of the field configuration , the expectation is that the measured value should be an average weighted in favor of the high dielectric response components .",
    "thus , the value @xmath133 = 44 obtained by haeni  @xcite is not @xmath130 , but is a weighted average of the three components , in accordance with our calculations .",
    "the agreement of this @xmath133 with the low - frequency electronic measurement is apparently coincidental .",
    "the latter measurement determines @xmath130 , but at low frequencies it is not unusual for additional extrinsic contributions to raise the value of the dielectric response .",
    "our calculation of the static dielectric tensor of sr@xmath115tio@xmath116 provides valuable information , not previously available , about the anisotropy of the response .",
    "this anisotropy is key to interpreting the available experimental data on the dielectric response of ceramic and thin film samples .",
    "we identify a dominant role played by ti - o chains in the lattice contribution to the response , which allows us to understand the anisotropy .",
    "this picture should generalize to higher rp phases of sr - ti - o , and further could be useful in tailoring the dielectric response of other perovskite - based systems .                                  is a common project of the universit catholique de louvain , corning incorporated and other contributors , see the url http://www.mapr.ucl.ac.be/abinit .",
    "it relies on an efficient fast fourier transform algorithm ( ref .  ) for the conversion of wavefunctions between real and reciprocal space , on the adaptation to a fixed potential of the band - by - band conjugate gradient method ( ref .  ) , and on a potential - based conjugate - gradient algorithm for the determination of the self - consistent potential ( ref .  ) .",
    "technical details on the computation of responses to atomic displacements and homogeneous electric fields can be found in ref .  , while ref .",
    "presents the subsequent computation of dynamical matrices , born effective charges , dielectric permittivity tensors , and interatomic force constants .",

    "the hybridization of the ti 3@xmath140 and o 2@xmath141 states has been shown to be the origin of the anomalous born effective charges ( becs ) in the perovskites  @xcite . because one expects this hybridization , or the rate of change of this hybridization  @xcite , to depend on the length of the ti - o bond we should compare becs in srtio@xmath5 and sr@xmath0tio@xmath1 at the same bond length ."
