    "even if such sources inevitably suffer from low efficiencies @xcite , this is currently the preferred way to inject single - photon wave packets as input for integrated quantum circuits through external fibre coupling @xcite , although an integrated source of heralded single photons has been recently realized @xcite .",
    "generation of pure single - photon states requires a quantum nonlinear source , i.e. ideally a two - level emitter that is prepared in its excited state and produces exactly a single quantum of light per pulse when relaxing to its ground state .",
    "one of the measures of sps efficiency is determined by the degree of antibunching in its second - order correlation function at zero - time delay , @xmath1 , whereby an ideal sps satisfies @xmath2 @xcite .",

    "the most promising results on single - photon emission have been originally achieved with iii - v materials , by using non - resonantly excited semiconductor quantum dots coupled to photonic microcavity modes , either in the purcell regime @xcite , in strong light - matter coupling @xcite , or even through a direct coupling to a one - dimensional mode such as a nanowire @xcite or a photon crystal waveguide @xcite .",
    "single - photon nonlinear behavior in the strong light - matter coupling regime has been shown also under resonant excitation @xcite , i.e. exploiting the photon blockade effect @xcite .",
    "the latter occurs in systems where two photons inside a resonant cavity produce an anharmonic shift of its response frequency that is greater than the line - broadening induced by losses and decoherence . under such conditions ,",
    "the transmission of a coherent light field is inhibited by the presence of a single - photon within the cavity , until such single - photon state is released : the system converts a low - power coherent state into single - photon streams at the same resonant frequency , thus behaving as a single - photon source .",
    "the efficiency of such a source can be assessed by measuring the antibunched @xmath3 in the transmitting channel , as experimentally shown for the first time with single caesium atoms strongly coupled to an optical fabry - prot cavity @xcite .",
    "a similar device can be realized when using a kerr - type nonlinear medium , which gives rise to an equivalent response in terms of the degree of photon antibunching of the transmitted field @xcite .",

    "no evidence of quantum nonlinear behavior from these systems has been reported , yet . besides this , applications of such devices as sps in integrated quantum photonics technologies might be limited in the long term by lack of suitable active media in the telecom - band , necessary to be interfaced with long - distance communication networks , and the commonly cryogenic working temperatures @xcite .    the possibility to engineer a sps based on single - photon blockade from _ non",
    "resonant _ kerr - type nonlinearities in passive devices ( such as nano - structured silicon or gaas platforms in the near infrared ) could represent a breakthrough from quantum photonics perspectives .",
    "first , it would allow large flexibility on the operational wavelengths , to be engineered in the telecom band by the photonic confinement in the materials transparency window .",
    "second , it would potentially allow room temperature operations , and possibly the elevated temperatures required for telecoms devices",
    ". finally , it would only require a coherent pump source such as a standard fiber - coupled telecom laser , thus providing a compact , stable , and relatively low cost device .",
    "it is a common perception that ordinary nonlinear media are intrinsically unable to display significant single - photon nonlinear behavior and a very large number of photons is necessary to produce appreciable effects , owing to the small value of the @xmath4 elements in ordinary bulk media @xcite .",
    "however , interesting perspectives might come from a proper nano - structuring of passive nonlinear materials , which could lead to strongly enhanced effective nonlinearities down to the single - photon level @xcite , especially using photonic crystal type confinement allowing to reach ultra - high quality factors @xcite and ultra - small confinement volumes @xcite in a purely dielectric structure . even if potentially not unrealistic , such goal is still quite challenging with single resonators .    here",
    "we report on an alternative strategy to realize an integrated sps based on non - resonant kerr - type nonlinearity , which exploits the effects of quantum interference in coupled photonic resonators @xcite .",
    "these effects have been shown to arise even for weak nonlinear response , namely for an anharmonic shift of the two - photon energy levels much smaller than the cavity mode linewidth .",
    "though very small , this anharmonic shift is enough to introduce a phase shift between different excitation pathways to the two - photon state , which for well chosen values of the system parameters suppresses its occupation as a result of destructive interference , leading to antibunching of the output light . we notice that an analogous mechanism had already been characterized in the simplest cqed system  a two - level atom coupled to a single mode resonator  in a seminal work by h. carmichael @xcite . for a given value of the anharmonic shift ,",
    "this scheme is able to relax by more than three orders of magnitude the cavity loss rate over conventional photon blockade devices , making the mechanism perfectly viable , for example , with commonly achievable defect cavities in photonic crystal structures . for such structures ,",
    "we further show that the photon antibunching is robust to typically expected rates of pure dephasing .",
    "a generalization of this scheme to multi - cavity arrays might give rise to interesting perspectives for the generation of continuous variable entangled states on chip @xcite .",
    "in the present work we concentrate our analysis on the optimization of @xmath3 as a figure of merit for sps , leaving the specific characterization of the device output in terms of single - photon wave packets for future reports . with this , we also expect this proposal to stimulate new research efforts in silicon quantum photonics and cmos - compatible quantum information technology .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ] we present the basic model , based on a master equation for the system hamiltonian and dissipative terms including the effects of losses and dephasing . in section [ sec : results ] , we give an overview of the steady state results , quantifying the optimized antibunching as a function of the system parameters , and test its robustness with respect to pure dephasing mechanisms . finally , we draw the conclusions of this work in section [ sec : conclu ] .",

    "the smaller the pumping rate , the better the single - photon behavior of the output .",

    "the delay - dependence of @xmath103 is determined by beatings between the two oscillators .",

    "this feature prevents the observation of photon antibunching in the pulsed excitation regime .",
    "however , it should be possible to address this issue by further processing the output of the two - cavity system .",
    "on one hand , a post - selective temporal filter with a @xmath106 delay window can be applied at the output of the coupled cavity device to ensure the presence of single - photon fock states . moreover",
    ", it was already shown that photon antibunching can be optimized in similar situations through passive interferometry @xcite or active quantum feedback schemes @xcite . in this sense , we believe @xmath107 is a necessary condition to be optimized before realizing a sps , but further analysis is needed to characterize its output , depending on the specific device implementation .",
    "such analysis goes beyond the scope of the present work .      , for different values of pure dephasing rate ( assumed equivalent for both symmetric and antisymmetric modes )",
    "parameters are as in figure  [ fig : gamma_pm ] , with @xmath108.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in photonic crystal molecules , the loss mechanism naturally leads to unbalanced quality factors for the symmetric and antisymmetric modes with respect to the quality factor of the isolated cavity that can be on the order of @xmath109 . neglecting the counterintuitive effect of possible antisymmetric ground states @xcite ,",
    "the lower energy mode is usually the symmetric combination of the two isolated cavity states , which has a reduced quality factor as compared to the isolated cavity @xcite .",
    "thus , we extract from the color plot in figure [ fig : gamma_pm ] the curve corresponding to @xmath110 ( i.e. the quality factor of the antisymmetric mode is larger than the one of the isolated cavity ) . the curve is plotted in figure [ fig : gamma_star ] ( curve corresponding to @xmath111 ) , showing a close - to - ideal anti - bunching of @xmath112 for @xmath113 , remarkably not far from the realistic ratio @xmath114 reported in literature @xcite for coupled photonic crystal cavities .",
    "a possible source of unwanted loss channels that could potentially spoil the effects of photon blockade induced by tunnel - coupling is pure dephasing . in a semiconductor cavity",
    ", dephasing can be due to thermal fluctuations or other nonlinear mechanisms enhanced by the same electromagnetic field confinement , giving rise to index fluctuations within the cavity region and hence a pure dephasing rate . even if such effect is usually neglected , and it is difficult to attribute a pure dephasing rate that is generally valid for any type of mechanism and material , it is of utmost importance to estimate such detrimental effects on the sps figure of merit for the purposes of the present work . as discussed in section [ sec : model ] , the effects of pure dephasing can be simply modeled by solving the master equation after adding the liouvillian term of the form represented in equation ( [ eq : deph12 ] ) .",

    "the robustness of such a device is tested against unwanted loss channels , e.g. giving rise to pure dephasing of the normal modes .",
    "further analysis will be needed to engineer the output of the device as a useful single - photon wave packet for actual applications in integrated quantum circuits .",
