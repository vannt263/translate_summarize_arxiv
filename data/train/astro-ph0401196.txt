    "the connection between type ic supernovae ( sne ) and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , as recently highlighted by grb030329=sn2003dh @xcite , have made a detailed understanding of this class of sne especially urgent .",
    "the first indication of an association of grbs with type ic sne was , however , already clear from the observations of grb980425=sn1998bw ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "type ic sne are believed to be the result of explosions of wolf - rayet stars , which have lost their hydrogen and most of their helium envelopes @xcite .",
    "progenitors of this type have strong stellar winds with mass loss rates @xmath3 and wind velocities @xmath4 .",
    "the interaction of the non - relativistic supernova ejecta with this wind has long been invoked to explain the radio and x - ray emission observed for this type of sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". for the grbs a relativistic version of the same scenario has been used to explain the properties of the grb afterglows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because of its small distance , 7.3 mpc , sn 2002ap has been subject to observations in several wavelength bands from radio to x - rays .",
    "the optical spectrum showed the sn to be a typical type ic , with no evidence for hydrogen or helium .",
    "although line blending made it hard to determine velocities accurately , @xcite argued that sn 2002ap belongs to the extremely energetic events sometimes referred to as hypernovae , where the prime example is sn 1998bw .",
    "the total kinetic energy is , however , sensitive to the fraction of the ejecta at very high velocity , which is not probed by the optical spectra .",
    "radio and x - ray observations are more sensitive to this part of the ejecta , since radiation in these wavelength bands are expected to arise in the shocked , faster moving outer material .",
    "hence , an accurate modeling of the radio and x - ray observations is well motivated .",
    "radio observations of sn 2002ap with vla , and modeling of these , have been discussed in @xcite ( in the following bkc ) . with the assumption of equipartion between magnetic fields and relativistic electrons , these authors showed that the radio light curves could be explained by a synchrotron self - absorption model , where the radio emitting material expands at @xmath5 c. while the fits to the light curves were satisfactory , there are some issues left open by the model . in particular , the implied optical thin synchrotron spectrum is considerably flatter than the observed one .",
    "the steeper than expected spectrum could be due to synchrotron cooling .",
    "if so , a magnetic field strength much in excess of equipartion is required .    in parallel to this",
    ", there has been several papers discussing xmm observations of sn 2002ap @xcite .",
    "these authors have interpreted the x - ray emission as coming from the thermal electrons behind the shock either directly as free - free emission or as inverse compton scattering of the photospheric sn photons . for such models to work ,",
    "the shock velocity has to be fairly low ( @xmath6 at day 6 ) . as we argue in this paper ,",
    "there is evience from optical line profiles that velocities higher than this are needed .",
    "furthermore , a low shock velocity implies a small size of the radio emission region and , hence , a high brightness temperature .    in this paper",
    "we show that a consistent picture of both the radio and x - ray observations can be obtained by a model where inverse compton cooling of the relativistic electrons by the photospheric photons is important .",
    "this explains both the steep radio spectrum , and the x - ray emission as coming from the same region , expanding at a velocity compatible with both optical and radio observations .",
    "the inclusion of the x - ray constraint also allows a determination of the ratio between the energy densities in magnetic fields and relativistic electrons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec_2 ] we discuss the constraints on different cooling processes of the relativistic electrons , using simple analytical arguments . in  [ sec_3 ]",
    "we illustrate this by a detailed model calculation of the observed light curves and radio and x - ray spectra .",
    "the implications of this and a comparison with related papers are given in ",
    "[ sec_disc ] . in",
    " [ sec_concl ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we will in the following use a distance of @xmath7 mpc for m 74 @xcite .",
    "an approximate expression for the optically thin synchrotron luminosity , @xmath8 , emitted at a frequency @xmath9 from behind a spherically symmetric , non - relativistic shock with velocity @xmath10 and radius @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the number density of relativistic electrons is denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the lorentz factor of electrons radiating at a typical frequency @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the energy distribution of the relativistic electrons injected behind the shock is parameterized as @xmath17 for @xmath18 and zero otherwise .",
    "the second bracket on the rhs of equation ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) is the fraction of the injected energy which is radiated away as synchrotron radiation .",
    "this is determined by three different time scales : @xmath19 is the dynamical time ( i.e. , the adiabatic cooling time ; roughly , the time since the onset of expansion ) , @xmath20 is the synchrotron cooling time for electrons radiating at a frequency @xmath9 , and @xmath21 is the cooling time corresponding to processes other than synchrotron radiation .",
    "the extensive observations of sn 1993j allowed a detailed modeling of the synchrotron radiation produced by the shock .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that behind the shock , the energy densities of relativistic electrons and magnetic field both scaled with the thermal energy density . furthermore , the shock expanded into a circumstellar medium in which density ( @xmath22 ) varied with radius as @xmath23 . as a result , @xmath24 .",
    "implicit in these scaling relations is the assumption of no time variation in @xmath25 .",
    "however , since the deduced value of @xmath26 was close to two , any variation in @xmath25 ( and/or @xmath27 ) would only introduce a logarithmic correction .",
    "the radio observations of sn 2002ap are such that a detailed modeling is not possible .",
    "hence , in order to limit the scope of our discussion , it will be assumed that the scaling relations obtained for sn 1993j are applicable also for sn 2002ap .",
    "this is not a critical assumption ; for example , as is shown below , the different scaling relations used by bkc give much the same results . with this background",
    "we will now discuss two alternative scenarios , where synchrotron respectively inverse compton cooling are responsible for the steep radio spectrum .",
    "consider first the case when synchrotron radiation dominates other cooling processes ( i.e. , @xmath28 ) . with the use of @xmath29 , one obtains from equation ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) the time variation of the optically thin synchrotron luminosity @xmath30 when radiative cooling is _ not _ important ( i.e. , @xmath31 )",
    ", this leads to @xmath32 where @xmath33 has been used .",
    "when synchrotron cooling _",
    "is _ important ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) , the corresponding expression for the synchrotron luminosity is @xmath35    the time dependence of @xmath36 in sn 2002ap used by bkc is the one for an ejecta whose structure is thought appropriate for a ic sn , expanding into a @xmath37 circumstellar medium .",
    "the self - similar solution @xcite then gives @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the effective power law index of the ejecta density .",
    "for the high velocities relevant for sn 2002ap , @xcite find @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "the observed optically thin synchrotron flux from sn 2002ap varies , roughly , as @xmath42 ( bkc ) .",
    "it is seen from equation ( [ eq:1.3 ] ) that this time dependence can be obtained for @xmath41 and @xmath43 .",
    "this is the same conclusion as that reached by bkc , although they used somewhat different scaling relations for the energy densities behind the shock .",
    "it is also consistent with an equipartition value for the magnetic field , since such a value implies @xmath31 .",
    "the latter is a necessary requirement for the validity of equation ( [ eq:1.3 ] ) .",
    "however , this solution predicts an optically thin spectral index @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "this is not consistent with the observed value @xmath46 .",
    "this discrepancy is exacerbated by the fact that the spectral range used to determine @xmath47 is rather close to where optical depth effects become important .",
    "hence , spectral curvature could make the actual spectral index of the optically thin radiation somewhat larger than the measured value of @xmath47 .",
    "short term variations are apparent in the radio light curves . as suggested by bkc , this is likely due to interstellar scattering and scintillation .",
    "these variations cause substantial variations in the instantaneous spectral index , which indicates that they are not broad - band .",
    "therefore , a spectral index measured at a given time should be treated with some care .",
    "the typical time scale for such flux variations is at most a few hours ; hence , the ratio of the fluxes at 4.86 ghz and 8.46 ghz averaged over several days should give a good estimate of the intrinsic optically thin spectral index of sn 2002ap .",
    "the value quoted above for the spectral index ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) was obtained by averaging over several observing periods and should thus be robust .",
    "an alternative solution would be to assume @xmath34 ( i.e. , synchrotron cooling is important ) and @xmath43 , since this gives a value of @xmath47 consistent with the observed one . the luminosity is then obtained from equation ( [ eq:1.4 ] ) as @xmath48 , which implies @xmath49 , or @xmath50 .",
    "incidentally , this is the same time dependence of the velocity as determined for the type iib sn 1993j .",
    "however , this scenario has a few not so attractive implications , as can be seen from the following arguments .",
    "the thermal energy density ( @xmath51 ) behind a non - relativistic supernova shock wave expanding into the circumstellar progenitor wind , varies with time ( @xmath52 , in days ) as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the mass loss rate of the progenitor star in units of @xmath55 and @xmath56 is its wind velocity in units of @xmath57 .",
    "the synchrotron cooling time for electrons radiating at a frequency @xmath9 is @xmath58 where @xmath59 . furthermore ,",
    "parameterizing the magnetic field strength as @xmath60 , the requirement for synchrotron cooling to be important ( i.e. , @xmath61 ) can be written @xmath62    in the cooling scenario , observations indicate that cooling is still important at @xmath63 ghz for @xmath64 days ( bkc ) . from equation ( [ eq:1.7 ] ) this implies @xmath65 since physically @xmath66 , equation ( [ eq:1.8 ] ) shows that cooling due to synchrotron radiation requires a very high mass loss rate . under such conditions free - free absorption in the circumstellar wind",
    "may become important .",
    "a realistic estimate of the free - free optical depth , however , necessitates a self - consistent determination of the temperature ahead of the shock ( cf .",
    "the discussion of sn 1993j in * ? ? ?",
    "this is not a straightforward exercise and , in addition , the result is rather model dependent @xcite .",
    "however , there is another consequence of the synchrotron cooling scenario that argues against its applicability to sn 2002ap . if cooling is important for electrons radiating at a frequency @xmath9 , then @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the fraction of the thermal energy , which goes into relativistic electrons .",
    "the logarithmic factor in equation ( [ eq:1.9 ] ) results from @xmath69 . with the use of the expression for @xmath51 , equation ( [ eq:1.9 ] )",
    "can be written @xmath70 the constraint in equation ( [ eq:1.8 ] ) then yields @xmath71 where the expression in equation ( [ eq:1.10 ] ) has been evaluated at @xmath72 days . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec_disc ] , the widths of the observed optical emission lines indicate velocities @xmath73 c , which is a lower limit for @xmath36 . hence , equation ( [ eq:1.11 ] ) requires an unprecedented low value of @xmath74 .",
    "although such a situation can not be excluded , we discuss in the next section a scenario in which cooling is dominated by compton scattering rather than synchrotron radiation .      when compton scattering dominates the cooling ( i.e. , @xmath75 $ ] , where @xmath76 is the time scale for compton cooling ) , the time variation of the optically thin synchrotron radiation is obtained from equation ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the energy density of photons .",
    "consider first the case when cooling is due to the external photons from the supernova itself ; hence , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the bolometric luminosity of the supernova .",
    "this then implies from equation ( [ eq:1.12 ] ) @xmath81 when compton cooling is strong ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) , the light curves for the optically thin frequencies are likely to show a minimum close to where the maximum of @xmath80 occurs . in cases where",
    "also the optically thick - thin transition is observed , this would give rise to a double peaked structure .",
    "the observed time variation of @xmath80 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "it is seen that the bolometric luminosity actually peaks during the main radio observing period .",
    "although the observations span a rather limited range in time and , furthermore , are likely to be affected by interstellar scattering and scintillation ( bkc ) , it is noteworthy that no pronounced minimum is apparent in the light curves for the optically thin frequencies .",
    "this can be understood if @xmath76 is roughly equal to @xmath19 .",
    "before making a more detailed numerical fit to the data , we will show that if @xmath83 we can obtain a consistent and plausible set of values for @xmath36 , @xmath1 and @xmath68 .    the time scale for compton cooling",
    "is given by @xmath84 with the use of @xmath85 the condition @xmath83 results in @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath88 and @xmath89 days have been used . as an illustration",
    "we show in figure [ fig1 ] the ratio of the compton cooling time scale to the adiabatic time scale for the specific model in  [ sec_3 ] with @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 . for other values @xmath94 .",
    "an x - ray flux was detected from sn 2002ap by xmm - newton on 2002 , feb3 ( @xmath95 days ) @xcite .",
    "due to the weak signal neither the total flux nor the spectral shape could be well determined .",
    "the uncertainty in the high energy flux is affected by the subtraction of the flux from a strong , nearby source with a hard spectrum , while at low energy the inability to constrain absorption in excess of the galactic value makes the observed flux a lower limit to the intrinsic one .",
    "the observations can be fitted either with a thermal or a power law spectrum . in the latter case , the deduced spectral index is consistent with that observed in the radio .",
    "it is therefore likely that the x - ray flux is the compton scattered optical radiation from the supernova .",
    "if this is the case , independent estimates of the energy densities in magnetic fields ( @xmath96 ) and relativistic electrons ( @xmath97 ) can be obtained . since @xmath43 @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the monochromatic optically thin synchrotron flux and @xmath100 is the corresponding x - ray flux .",
    "as it turns out , the deduced value of @xmath16 is such that the same electrons , roughly , are producing both the radio and x - ray fluxes .",
    "hence , equation ( [ eq:1.16a ] ) is not sensitive to the exact value of @xmath26 . assuming no intrinsic absorption and a power law spectrum with a spectral index consistent with that in the radio give at @xmath95 days a monochromatic x - ray flux @xmath101 . at the same time",
    ", @xmath102 and one finds from equation ( [ eq:1.16a ] ) @xmath103 if now @xmath83 , equations ( [ eq:1.16 ] ) and ( [ eq:1.17 ] ) lead to @xmath104 ; hence , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "together with the observed value @xmath107 at @xmath95 days , this implies @xmath108 .    with a supernova distance @xmath109 mpc ,",
    "the observed x - ray flux corresponds to a monochromatic x - ray luminosity @xmath110 , from which the energy density in relativistic electrons is obtained as ( cf .",
    "[ [ eq:1.1 ] ] ) @xmath111 where , again , the logarithmic factor is due to @xmath112 . furthermore , equation ( [ eq:1.18 ] ) assumes @xmath83 so that , roughly , half of the injected energy emerges as x - ray flux and that , in turn , half of this is emitted through the forward shock ( the other half being absorbed by the supernova ejecta ) .",
    "hence , at @xmath89 days , @xmath113 . with the use of @xmath108 , this leads to @xmath114 .",
    "since the unknown values of @xmath27 and @xmath25 enter only logarithmically in @xmath97 , this shows that in the compton cooling scenario for sn 2002ap , where the relativistic electrons cool on the external photons from the supernova itself , @xmath115 , i.e. , there is rough equipartition between the energy densities in magnetic fields and relativistic electrons .",
    "however , both of these energy densities are considerably smaller than that in thermal particles @xmath116 , unless the mass loss rate of the progenitor is small .",
    "the actual values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 deduced above are roughly the same as those derived by bkc using radio data alone ( in particular , the observed value of the synchrotron self - absorption frequency ) and _ assuming _ equipartition .",
    "the fact that these two independent methods to determine the energy densities in magnetic fields and relativistic electrons give the same value lends support to the compton cooling scenario .",
    "this is further strengthened by the determination of the shock velocity , for which both methods give approximately the same value .",
    "internally produced synchrotron photons are unlikely to contribute to the cooling as can be seen from the following argument . when cooling is important and @xmath112 , the energy density of synchrotron photons is @xmath117 .",
    "the condition corresponding to equation ( [ eq:1.8 ] ) then becomes @xmath118 .",
    "since @xmath119 is necessary for compton scattering to dominate synchrotron radiation , this requires an even higher mass loss rate than the synchrotron cooling scenario .",
    "the estimates above show that compton cooling can provide a natural scenario for sn 2002ap . a more detailed model fit to the observations is therefore warranted .",
    "we have for this purpose used the numerical model in @xcite , which solves the radiative transfer equation for the synchrotron radiation , including self - absorption , together with the kinetic equation for the electron distribution , including synchrotron , compton and coulomb losses .",
    "the latter is unimportant for sn 2002ap .",
    "as discussed above , we assume that a constant fraction , @xmath1 , of the thermal energy behind the shock goes into magnetic fields and a fraction , @xmath68 , into relativistic electrons .",
    "the other important input parameters are @xmath26 , @xmath120 , and @xmath39 , the ejecta density power law index ( specifying the shock velocity , see above ) .",
    "finally , the bolometric luminosity , @xmath80 , determines the compton cooling .",
    "for @xmath80 we use the bolometric light curve determined by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "because free - free absorption is unimportant in the cases we consider , and the synchrotron self - absorption is determined by @xmath16 , @xmath13 and @xmath121 only , @xmath120 always enters in the combination @xmath122 and @xmath123 , reducing the number of free parameters by one , but also preventing us from determining @xmath120 separately .    using this model ,",
    "we have varied the parameters to give a best fit of the radio light curves together with the xmm flux at 6 days , taken from @xcite . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the resulting light curves and in figure [ fig2 ] the full spectrum at 6 days , together with the vla and xmm observations . in this figure",
    "we have also added the luminosity from the supernova photosphere .",
    "the latter can on day 6 be well approximated as a black - body with temperature of @xmath124 k and a total luminosity of @xmath125 @xcite . as input electron spectrum we use @xmath126 , and @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the latter is only important for the upper energy limit of the gamma - ray flux from inverse compton .    in order to reproduce the decrease in the optically thin parts of the light curves , the best fit model has @xmath129 , in agreement with the expected density structure for the progenitor of an ic sn @xcite",
    "this is also consistent with hydrodynamical models of type ic supernovae , where the power law index varies between @xmath130 and @xmath131 for ejecta velocities above @xmath132 @xcite.the expansion velocity we find is @xmath133 at 10 days , somewhat lower than deduced by bkc . as discussed in  [ sec_2.2 ] ,",
    "the requirement that inverse compton scattering should reproduce both the x - ray flux and the synchrotron radio spectrum , sets the value of @xmath134 as well as @xmath135 , and we find that @xmath136 and @xmath137 . note that @xmath68 is roughly proportional to @xmath138 .",
    "since the values of both @xmath25 and @xmath27 are unknown , this introduces an uncertainty in the value of @xmath68 ; for example , using @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the lorentz factor of the electrons radiating at the synchrotron self - absorption frequency , yields @xmath141 . as anticipated in  [ sec_2.2 ] , inverse compton cooling of the electrons is important , leading to a steepening of the electron spectrum and a spectral flux @xmath142 , in agreement with observations ( bkc ) .",
    "the importance of compton cooling for the calculated light curves can be seen especially at high frequencies , where the cooling time is comparable to the dynamical time ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . for these",
    "a depression is apparent at the time of maximum compton cooling at @xmath143 days .",
    "in order to derive the main parameters characterizing an observed synchrotron source of unknown size , one often has to invoke the assumption of equipartition between energies in relativistic electrons and magnetic field ( i.e. , @xmath144 ) .",
    "the independent determination of these quantities requires either that radiative cooling is important within the observed frequency range , or that the compton scattered radiation is observed . in the latter case",
    ", the scattered radiation can be the synchrotron photons themself or come from a known external source of photons .",
    "we have shown in this paper that the radio , optical and x - ray observations of sn 2002ap can be understood in a scenario , wherein the relativistic electrons cool by inverse compton scattering on the photospheric supernova photons and thereby giving rise to the x - ray emission . since",
    "both radiative cooling and the compton scattered emission are observed , not only can a value for @xmath145 be derived but , in addition , an internal consistency check of the model can be made ; for example , the value of the synchrotron self - absorption frequency can be predicted .",
    "the compton cooling scenario _ implies _ rough equipartition conditions in sn 2002ap .",
    "furthermore , the actual value deduced for @xmath1 ( @xmath146 ) is close to the one derived by bkc from the observed values of the synchrotron self - absorption frequency and flux _ assuming _ equipartition .",
    "this shows that the model self - consistently predicts the frequency of the synchrotron self - absorption , as was illustrated in  [ sec_3 ] .",
    "there is , however , one underlying assumption ; namely , a spherically symmetric source",
    ". it is seen in  [ sec_2.2 ] that the only place where the assumption of a spherically symmetric source geometry enters is in the derivation of the energy density of relativistic electrons from the observed x - ray luminosity ( cf .",
    "[ [ eq:1.18 ] ] ) .",
    "deviations from spherical symmetry , for example a jet structure , would then have to be compensated for by an increased energy density of relativistic electrons . since the deduced values of @xmath16 and @xmath10 are not affected ( cf . eqs .",
    "[ [ eq:1.16 ] ] and[[eq:1.17 ] ] ) , this results in an increased synchrotron self - absorption frequency .",
    "due to the short term flux variations , which are likely caused by interstellar scattering and scintillation , the limits of the allowed variations of the predicted self - absorption frequency are hard to evaluate precisely .",
    "from the early observations at the lowest frequency ( 1.43 ghz ) , when the radiation at this frequency was optically thick , it seems unlikely that the observed self - absorption frequency has been underestimated by more than a factor two . since synchrotron self - absorption frequency scales with energy density of relativistic electrons as @xmath147",
    ", the value of @xmath68 can be increased at most by a factor ten .",
    "hence , the solid angle of a jet has to cover at least 10  % of the sky .",
    "this conclusion is similar to the one reached by @xcite , using a different line of reasoning .",
    "bkc argue that the observed xmm flux can be described as an extrapolation of the synchrotron flux .",
    "this is apparently based on the assumption that the radio spectral index is close to @xmath148 , which is needed to explain the light curves in the absence of cooling .",
    "the resulting spectral break in the optical frequency range due to synchrotron cooling in an equipartition magnetic field would give rise to an x - ray flux and spectral index in approximate agreement with those observed . however , as discussed in  [ sec_2.2 ] , the observed spectral index in the radio is @xmath149 , which is similar to that in the x - ray range , making this scenario untenable .",
    "@xcite explain the x - ray flux as a result of _ thermal _ inverse compton scattering by the thermal electrons behind the shock ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in order to have sufficient electron optical depth",
    ", they need to have the x - ray emitting region moving with a velocity @xmath150 .",
    "a similar low velocity of the forward shock is needed in the model by @xcite .",
    "they argue that the x - ray emission is free - free emission from the reverse shock .",
    "there are several features of these models which make them less attractive . in the thermal inverse compton scattering model",
    ", the spectral index is very sensitive both to shock temperature and optical depth .",
    "the low shock temperature in the free - free model requires a density structure of the ejecta corresponding to @xmath151 at velocities @xmath6 , which is quite different from that thought appropriate fora ic sn , @xmath152 @xcite , in this velocity range .",
    "in addition to these model specific problems , there are two rather model independent arguments against any model invoking such low shock velocities .",
    "first , the line emission observed in sn 2002ap should set a lower limit to the velocity of the forward shock .",
    "due to line blending , accurate velocities were hard to measure in sn 2002ap .",
    "however , it seems clear that velocities of at least @xmath153 are indicated .",
    "@xcite find in their first spectrum at 2 days a photospheric velocity of 30,000 km / s , and at 3.5 days 20,500 km / s .",
    "it is important to note that this is the velocity where the _ continuum _ is becoming optically thick and , therfore , provides a lower limit to the velocity of the _ line _ emitting regions .",
    "this is confirmed by the observations of @xcite , which show that the p - cygni profile of the o i @xmath154 line on day 15 extends at least to @xmath155 , where it becomes blended with other lines .",
    "this , in turn , should be a conservative lower limit to the _ shock _ velocity and , hence , calls in question the consistency of the proposed models .",
    "another issue for low velocity models is the incorporation of the observed radio emission . assuming the radio emission to come from behind the forward and/or the reverse shock , implies a brightness temperature which scales , roughly , as @xmath156 .",
    "the low shock velocities argued for in the above two models result in brightness temperatures about a factor 10 larger than the compton limit .",
    "this , in turn , would produce an x - ray flux much in excess to that observed .",
    "the rough equipartion between the energies in relativistic electrons and magnetic fields found for sn 2002ap is in sharp contrast to the conditions in sn 1993j for which @xmath157 was deduced by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these are the only two sne for which an independent estimate of @xmath158 has been possible to make . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that for the afterglows of grbs the deduced values of @xmath158 exhibit a large range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , there is a clear tendency for this ratio to be smaller , or for some afterglows much smaller , than unity .",
    "although the conditions for both magnetic field generation and particle acceleration may differ considerably between relativistic and non - relativistic shocks , a plausible cause for the substantial difference in the value of @xmath158 behind the non - relativistic shocks in sn 1993j and sn 2002ap is harder to find .",
    "we have shown that in sn 2002ap inverse compton scattering of the photospheric photons is important for those relativistic electrons producing the radio emission .",
    "the scattering cools the relativistic electrons , and gives rise to an x - ray flux which matches the observed flux level as well as the spectral index .",
    "the value for the shock velocity , @xmath0 , is in rough agreement with bkc .",
    "the deduced energy densities in magnetic fields and relativistic electrons are close to equipartition . however , without _ a priori _ knowledge of what fraction of the total injected energy density these quantities correspond to , no estimate can be made of the mass loss rate of the progenitor star . from the radio and x - ray observations",
    "the mass loss rate can be constrained to @xmath159 .",
    "bkc assumed @xmath160 , which would imply @xmath161 ; this is very low for a wolf - rayet star . turning this argument around",
    ", a typical wolf - rayet mass loss rate of @xmath162 and wind velocity of @xmath163 , would imply @xmath164 .",
    "an important conclusion from this paper is that any self - consistent model of the radio and x - ray flux observed from sn 2002ap needs to include effects due to the photospheric emission .",
    "it is likely that in any sne , for which the synchrotron emission from behind the shock becomes transparent not too long after the photospheric emission has reached its maximum , inverse compton scattering can be an important factor shaping the radio and/or x - ray spectrum .",
    "another outcome of our analysis is that the time variation of the radio emission allows a determination of the density structure of the ejecta .",
    "it is reassuring that the result is close to what is expected theoretically ."
