    "the 6.7ghz methanol maser transition has been detected from very many massive star - forming regions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . since the early report of @xcite ,",
    "the temporal properties of methanol masers have been intensively studied . in particular , the phenomenon of periodic or regular variability at 6.7ghz in high - mass young stellar objects ( hmysos ) is a matter of active debate .    to date , periodic variations in the maser emission have been detected from a dozen hmysos ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they are characterized either by flaring or sinusoidal patterns with periods ranging from 29.5 to 668d and the relative amplitude from 0.2 to more than 30 @xcite .",
    "some of the sources show periodic behaviour in part of the spectrum , whereas others display synchronised variations of all maser features , sometimes with delays in flaring between individual features ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the 12.2ghz maser emission , when observed , commonly shows periodic amplitude variations higher than those at 6.7ghz @xcite .",
    "g9.62 + 0.20e , an archetype of the class , exhibits a regular flaring behaviour also in the 107ghz methanol maser line @xcite .",
    "correlated periodic variability between the 6.7ghz methanol and 4.8ghz formaldehyde maser lines has been reported for g37.55@xmath00.20 @xcite .",
    "different models have been proposed to explain the regularity of the methanol maser flares . for sources with periods of 240 - 400d it has been postulated that a binary interaction between a hmyso and its companion could periodically alter either the seed photon flux or pump rate in the maser region ( @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , a colliding - wind binary ( cwb ) could produce a periodic pulse in the ionising radiation that changes the electron density and periodically modulates the free - free emission from the region against which the maser clouds are projected .",
    "in another model , the periodic maser variation is related to the flux of infrared emission that could be regulated by periodic accretion of material from the circumbinary disc onto a protostar or accretion disc @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed that the dust temperature variations in the circumbinary accretion disc are caused by rotation of hot and dense material of the spiral shock wave in the disc central gap .",
    "the maser brightness depends on the density of the shocked material along the line between the central star and the maser region .",
    "simulations of stellar evolution indicate that a hmyso still accreting at a rate larger than @xmath3yr@xmath2 and with a radius exceeding 100@xmath4 at maximum is pulsationally unstable @xcite .",
    "the expected variations of luminosity with typical periods of 10@xmath0100d could drive the periodic variability of methanol masers with a sinusoidal light curve .",
    "@xcite mapped g9.62 + 0.20e at 12.2ghz using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) and found that the brightness of the maser components increased during the course of a flare , whereas the overall structure was unchanged .",
    "the morphology of the 6.7ghz maser emission of the periodic source g22.357 + 0.066 was also unchanged in both observations near the burst maximum @xcite .",
    "these findings imply that the causes of the flares originate outside the maser region .",
    "in this paper we report the discovery of periodic variations in four 6.7ghz methanol sources and produce an updated light curve of the known periodic source g22.357 + 0.066 ( @xcite ) obtained as part of a long - term monitoring programme of a large sample of objects detected with the torun 32 m telescope ( @xcite ) .",
    "134 target sources were selected from the torun methanol maser catalogue ( @xcite ) using coarse criteria intended primarily to monitor the objects with peak flux density greater than 5jy and declination north of @xmath011 .",
    "these objects stay above the elevation limit for relatively long durations and are suitable for a survey with the torun 32 m radio telescope .",
    "a detailed description of the sample will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "each object was observed at least once a month during the period from 2009 june to 2010 october ; then the objects showing a strong variability were observed at irregular intervals of 5@xmath010d , until 2014 april .",
    "several gaps of 3@xmath04 weeks in the monitoring campaign occurred due to scheduling constraints .",
    "the 6668.519mhz methanol maser transition was observed in a frequency - switching mode using a dual - channel hemt receiver mounted on the 32 m radio telescope .",
    "the details of the observing setup have been described by @xcite . in summary , the system equivalent flux density was about 300jy , the half - power beam width 5.5 arcmin and the pointing accuracy 22arcsec .",
    "the autocorrelator was configured to record 4096 channels over 4mhz for each polarisation , yielding a spectral resolution of 0.09   after hanning smoothing .",
    "the typical rms noise level in the spectra was 0.200.25jy after averaging both polarisations .",
    "the system was calibrated by measuring the continuum point source 3c123 @xcite .",
    "further checks were undertaken using the methanol maser source g32.745@xmath00.076 , in which some spectral features have not shown variability higher than @xmath18per cent ( @xcite ) .",
    "the errors on the absolute flux density measurements , estimated from the standard deviation of the flux density values of non - variable features of this source , were usually less than 10per cent .",
    "the edited and flagged light curves were typically de - trended using a third - order polynomial or lower prior to period search .",
    "figure [ proc - effect ] shows the effect of these procedures for the light curve of 80.09 feature of source g22.357 + 0.066 .",
    "data points were discarded if their flux densities differed by @xmath5 from the values observed just on the previous and the next day .",
    "this criterion was applied only for the intervals of quiescent emission . in the flare intervals sampled daily",
    "the individual observations were discarded only if the flux density obviously dropped below @xmath5 as compared to the adjacent points . in effect about 2 per cent of observations of g22.357 + 0.066 were discarded while for the rest sources the percentage of flagged observations is smaller .",
    "slow and low amplitude changes of the flux density in the quiescent state were fitted with a third - order polynomial ( fig .",
    "[ proc - effect ] ) . in several cases",
    "a fit with a linear function was enough .    in order to calculate the period and assess its significance the ls periodogram ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    "this well established method is effective for unevenly spaced data as ours . for each periodically variable feature",
    "we obtained a normalised phase - folded flare profile by dividing the time - series into cycles based on its best - fit period and the flux density values in each cycle were divided by the maximum observed in the cycle .",

    "time delays in flaring between features were calculated with the discrete correlation function @xcite .",
    "we have detected periodicity in five sources of which four are reported for the first time .",

    "the light curves of features with periodic behaviour are shown in figures [ lc_g22p357 ] and [ lc_four - sources ] and their parameters are given in table [ periodic - features ] .",

    "periodic changes in the flux density of both spectral features occurred until mjd 56208 , then the red - shifted emission at 97.10 slightly decreased without any periodic modulation , whereas periodic changes of the blue - shifted emission centred at 94.78 were seen throughout our monitoring ( figs .",

    "no periodic emission is seen from the 62.30 cloud that is located 1.03 \" ( 7100au ) south - west from the site of the periodic emission .",
    "we conclude that the mechanism causing periodic changes of the flux density is effective only in a relatively small ( @xmath23480au ) region of the source . as the position uncertainty of the candidate of hmyso observed in the infrared ( fig .",
    "[ periodic - evn - three ] ) is comparable with the size of the overall maser distribution it is plausible that it may drive the maser periodicity .    g25.411 + 0.105 shows a ring - like distribution of the maser clouds ( fig .",
    "[ periodic - evn - three ] ) with a diameter of 190mas ( @xcite ) that corresponds to 1000au for the distance of 5.35kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "the maser emission does not show any velocity gradient ; some blue- and red - shifted clouds are considerably blended spatially and in some spectral channels ( e.g. 94.82 ) the emission appears at very different parts of the ring .",
    "in such a case the light curve of the blue - shifted emission can significantly differ from that of the red - shifted emission as we observed with the single dish .",
    "the range of brightness temperatures of the maser components is @xmath47k .",
    "the unresolved ( 0.8\"@xmath480.6  ) continuum source at 25.5ghz ( @xcite ) coincides within 200mas with the strongest maser component .",
    "this continuum emission is interpreted as an ionized jet at the base of a massive flow observed in the co lines ( @xcite ) and it may induce the maser variations . if the source could be detected at cm wavelengths it would be possible to evaluate the effect of the background emission on the maser flaring .",
    "we have inspected the first three objects listed in table [ periodic - features ] for continuum emission at 5ghz using the cornish survey ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "no emission was seen at the @xmath49 level of 2mjy .",
    "we found no evidence for cm radio emission in the remaining targets when searching the literature using the simbad database .",
    "one can speculate that our periodic sources are associated with hmyso in binary systems in very early phases with vigorous accretion processes .",
    "we have found four new periodic methanol sources at 6.7ghz and updated the light curve of the previously known source g22.357 + 0.066 .",
    "this study increases the number of known periodic masers to 16 with a median period of 210d .",
    "the period distribution hints to an association of the periodic masers with massive binary systems .",
    "the diversity of variability patterns can not be easily interpreted within the frame of a simple model of the colliding - wind binary system which provides periodic variations of the continuum emission from the background region .",
    "the study revealed that the periodic variations can be confined to a single feature in the spectrum for some sources . in two sources ,",
    "the maser flares originate in a region of linear size less than 480 - 760au that contributes 20 - 50 per cent of the overall maser distribution .",
    "this implies that the mechanism generating periodic maser variations affects only some parts of the masing regions .",

    "we are grateful to eric grard for careful reading and helpful comments on the manuscript and andrej sobolev and sergey parfenov for useful discussions .",
