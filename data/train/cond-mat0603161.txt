    "in particular , rather sharp kink - like change in doping dependence is observed in experiment at about @xmath265 , @xcite while it is found in our theory at lower doping .",
    "one obvious reason for this discrepancy is that , strickly speaking , we can not quantitatively address the phonon softening problem by using our _ static _ charge susceptibility .",

    "@xcite a dynamical susceptibility is therefore required which is however beyond the scope of present work .",

    "this contribution , which is a fraction of @xmath267 , @xcite will stabilize a gutzwiller band narrowing effect at doping levels @xmath268 below which a linear doping dependence @xmath269 due to a hole - dilution effect sets in .",

    "@xcite    in general , it seems that a kink feature in the doping dependence of @xmath19 phonon softening @xcite , which apparently parallels with the so - called `` yamada plot '' for the spin incommensurability @xcite , provides an interesting test case for theory .",

    "this relation makes it clear the origin of strong momentum structure in electron - phonon vertex function found in refs .",
    " this simply reflects highly momentum - selective action of the gutzwiller constraint on density fluctuations as we emphasized in previous sections of this paper . indeed , as @xmath275 at small momenta",
    ", one realizes that the effective electron - phonon interaction is essentially the bare one . at large momenta , however , it is strongly suppressed as the hole density @xmath3 is reduced .",
    "@xcite this results in a `` predominantly forward scattering '' of electrons on phonons in cases when this coupling is located in a density channel ( which is the case for the scattering on bond - stretching phonons ) . in the context of cuprates",
    ", one should however realize that this small - momentum peak structure in @xmath16 , hence also in @xmath272 is in fact suppressed by long - range coulomb repulsion .",
