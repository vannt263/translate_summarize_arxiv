    "the wind - driving mechanism of giant stars is poorly determined ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . conventionally , low- and intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath110.88 m@xmath1 ) ascending the asymptotic giant branch ( agb )",
    "are thought to first exhibit a magneto - acoustically driven wind , which later transitions to a pulsation - enhanced , dust - driven wind ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "initially , magneto - acoustic waves propagating through the outer stellar atmosphere heat a stellar chromosphere providing energy for an outflow , either directly or via solar - like magnetic reconnection events .",
    "later , @xmath12-mechanism pulsations are stochastically excited by the star s large atmospheric convective cells .",
    "these pulsations levitate its outer atmosphere .",
    "the levitated material cools and condenses into dust .",
    "the opaque dust absorbs outgoing stellar radiation and re - radiates it isotropically , imparting net outward momentum , which forces it from the star .",
    "collisional coupling with gas particles ejects the entire envelope into the interstellar medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the mechanism by which the wind is ejected is important not only for modelling this stage of evolution , but also for its extrapolation outside well - measured environments .",
    "it is particularly important in metal - poor stars , hence the early universe . here ,",
    "stars of a given mass are smaller and hotter , so a pulsation - driven wind must impart more energy to levitate material to the same dust - formation radius .",
    "less refractory material means a lower dust - to - gas ratio , decreasing the efficacy and velocity of a dust - driven wind .",
    "separation of gas and dust can occur , leading to a drift velocity , preventing the escape of the gas , and perhaps depleting the star of dust - forming elements .    despite this",
    ", prolific dust condensation is seen around metal - poor stars , indicating these stars somehow drive substantial stellar winds @xcite .",
    "dust production begins at @xmath96002000 l@xmath1 @xcite",
    ". however , there is insufficient opacity to drive the wind , particularly among oxygen - rich stars , until the star reaches higher luminosities @xcite . by measuring the wind expansion velocity and total mass - loss rate of stars as a function of properties such as luminosity and metallicity",
    ", we can determine the point at which the transition to a pulsation and/or dust - driven wind occurs .",
    "such measurements are usually derived from ( sub-)mm co lines . however , most metal - poor stars with well - known properties lie at large distances , in globular clusters or dwarf galaxies .",
    "their distance and interstellar radiation environment make them challenging to observe .",
    "a search for closer dust - producing giant stars with _ hipparcos _ parallaxes identified several nearby targets @xcite .",
    "one of these targets was eu del ( hip 101810 , hd 196610 ) , the stellar parameters of which are listed in table [ startable ] .",
    "eu del is among the closest bright giant stars .",
    "table [ startable ] lists its properties and figure [ sedfig ] shows its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "it is a semi - regular variable , with a characteristic period of @xmath960 days @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated that eu del had a metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath9 1 .",
    "however , their metallicity was poorly constrained and based on an automated fitting procedure that was not optimised for cool stars .",
    "iras _ lrs spectrum of the star originally led it to be classified as ` naked ' ( i.e.  not producing dust ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , detailed modelling of the entire spectral energy distribution shows it to have considerable infrared excess , indicative of circumstellar dust @xcite .",
    "unusually for an oxygen - rich star , it does not show the typical 10-@xmath10 m silicate or 11-@xmath10 m alumina dust features , which partly explains the difference in classificationsm .",
    "this is divided out and the normalised spectrum integrated .",
    "stars with @xmath138 per cent emission are classed as naked .",

    "methods 1 and 2 give [ fe / h ] = 0.30 @xmath2 0.05 and 0.23 @xmath2 0.06 dex , respectively .",
    "the quoted errors are almost certainly underestimates , as no uncertainties are given on the fitting factors in either method .",
    "based on the scatter of the [ fe / h ] of individual stars from the ` known ' cluster average ( * ? ? ?",

    "we also note that no iron lines are used , thus the determination of [ fe / h ] assumes a particular stellar composition .",
    "we must therefore account for the fact that the formalism is calibrated on @xmath31-enhanced stars in globular clusters .",
    "these stars are typically ca - rich and c - poor , which have opposing effects on the abundance determination ( na abundance can vary ; @xcite ) .",

    "russell diagram @xcite is not significantly to the blue of the main red giant branch , as would be expected for a markedly metal - poor star ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "metallic iron produces a mass - loss rate greater than that measured ( section [ mlrsect ] ) , however we argue in the previous paragraph why this does not necessarily mean it is invalid .    crucially , however , the expansion velocities in all cases are very small : only 2.1 , 2.4 , 7.5 and 5.5 km s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the metallic iron and amorphous carbon velocities are below the velocities at which the dusty models can be considered valid ( 5 km s@xmath3 ) and far below the expansion velocity of the wind of eu del ( 9.5 km s@xmath3 ) .",

    "they will therefore spend less time in the radiation - driving zone .",
    "hence , the time - integrated acceleration the wind experiences due to radiation pressure will be less than suggested by the velocities quoted above .      without direct observation of the magnetic field strength and the stellar rotation period , it is difficult to reasonably determine the energy in a magnetically - driven wind .",

    "this chromosphere has a low filling factor , but exhibits emission components to chromospherically active lines ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "such lines include h@xmath31 , h@xmath74 , h@xmath75 ( etc . ) , the infrared calcium triplet , the mg ii k and na ii d lines .",
    "emission components to these lines are variable in strength , but rarely disappear completely .",
    "no emission components are found in the optical spectrum of @xcite .",
    "emission components are normally observed to disappear in more luminous stars , probably when the chromosphere becomes destabilised by the stellar pulsation .",
    "they later give way to stronger , less structured emission lines as atmospheric shocks from the puslations again heat the circumstellar environment @xcite . in conclusion",
    ", we can not rule out a magnetically driven wind , but neither does it appear likely from qualitative indicators .",
    "over the course of the pulsation cycle , a fraction of the radiation from the stellar interior is trapped during the rising phase of the stellar pulsation and released during the falling phase . in a pulsation - driven wind ,",
    "the kinetic energy given to the wind must be less than half the energy trapped by the stellar atmosphere during the pulsation cycle .",
    "hence pulsations have sufficient energy to drive a wind if : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the peak - to - peak pulsation amplitude , measured as a fraction of the star s bolometric flux @xcite . this should be very similar to the light curve amplitude at the peak of the star s sed",
    ". light curves from the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) , although of poor signal - to - noise @xcite , show the amplitude of eu del rises from @xmath90.05 mag at 4.9 @xmath10 m to @xmath90.1 mag at 2.2 @xmath10 m ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the amplitude increases further to @xmath90.45 mag in the _ hipparcos _ data at 0.53 @xmath10 m @xcite .",
    "the star s sed peak is in the @xmath23-band .",
    "the @xmath23-band photometric amplitude is likely to be slightly larger than that at 2.2 @xmath10 m , but smaller than the optical variation . assuming the phase lag between the optical and infrared lightcurves is small",
    ", we can conservatively expect that the bolometric variability ( @xmath77 ) , is @xmath910 per cent of the total intensity .",
    "half of this is available to drive the wind , or 1.2 @xmath7 10@xmath78 w. were this energy liberated into the wind , it could support a mass - loss rate of a staggering 0.021 m@xmath1 yr@xmath3 . as highlighted by @xcite ,",
    "only a tiny fraction ( one part in @xmath910@xmath79 ) of this needs to be liberated to drive the wind .",
    "a more realistic estimate may come from pulsation growth rates .",
    "the dimensionless growth rate ( @xmath80 ) defines the fractional increase in pulsation amplitude per pulsation cycle .",
    "since most stars have stable pulsation amplitudes , this defines the maximum fraction of pulsation energy that could be expended to drive material from the star ( the remainder of which will likely heat the outer atmosphere ) , thus : @xmath81 for eu del , we can expect growth rates of @xmath910 per cent @xcite , meaning @xmath910@xmath82 w is available to drive the wind : substantially more than the @xmath475.6 @xmath7 10@xmath48 w mentioned at the start of section [ drivingsect ] .    of the energy expended by the stellar pulsation , almost all of it is required to overcome the gravitation potential of the star .",
    "the pulsation - enhanced , dust - driven wind model already relies on pulsation to provide half of this energy to levitate material from the stellar surface to @xmath92 r@xmath83 , so it is not unreasonable to suppose it can provide the remaining half as well .",
    "radiation pressure would then become a small additional component , creating a pulsation - p_driven _",
    ", dust-_enhanced _ wind .",
    "expansion velocity profiles of luminous evolved stars are not consistent with this pulsation - driven scenario ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , these stars have greater mass - loss rates ( @xmath910@xmath84 m@xmath1 yr@xmath3 ) and faster wind velocities ( @xmath91030 km s@xmath3 ) than we observe here .",
    "they are typically either massive supergiants with weaker , stochastic pulsations , or heavily obscured agb stars where trapped radiation can be more effective in driving a wind . while radiation pressure on winds may therefore be effective in these environments , they may not be effective in strongly pulsating but less obscured stars like eu del . given the difficulty of the other methods to drive a wind from eu del , we suggest the dominant driving mechanism for the wind of this low - luminosity agb star is the pulsation itself .",

    "power in shorter - period pulsation modes is typically associated with stars of a higher mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the origins of sequence f are not clear , but @xcite suggests this is the higher - mass counterpart of the fundamental mode .",
    "eu del appears to be an overtone ( sequence c@xmath94 ) pulsator , with the fundamental period being 132.6 days .",
    "the fundamental and overtone modes are shifted to the shorter - period side of sequences b and c , as is normal for an overtone pulsator ( see @xcite , his figure 4 ) .",

    "the fundamental mode is not clear , as no mode in sequence c seems to be excited .",
    "two modes bracketing sequence b are excited , as are two modes within the sequence f region .",
    "if sequence f represents the fundamental mode , a mass of @xmath90.95 or 1.08 m@xmath1 is implied for vy leo .",
    "we have highlighted the mass corresponding to the slightly stronger 84.5-day period ( 0.95 m@xmath1 ) in table [ starcomptable ] .",
    "this would make vy leo a more massive star .    for stars of the same luminosity",
    ", an observational correlation exists between power in longer - period , fundamental modes and the red infrared colours which indicate strong stellar mass loss ( * ? ? ?",

    "at the same luminosity , more massive stars have shorter - period pulsations .",
    "this is true of both their fundamental pulsation period ( eq .",
    "[ woodeq ] , @xcite ) and mode in which they pulsate ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their table 2 ) .",
    "therefore , at a given luminosity , longer pulsation periods imply lower stellar masses and higher mass - loss rates .",
    "hence , strong mass loss will start earlier in lower - mass stars , driven by their long - period pulsations .",
    "also , at any particular luminosity , a low - mass star will have stronger mass - loss than its high - mass equivalent .    in comparing eu del and vy leo , the increase in mass - loss rate appears to be caused by the more effective long - period pulsations driving mass loss .",
    "hence this provides additional evidence that the wind of eu del is driven by pulsations .",
    "pulsation likely does not enhance the wind of vy leo , hence it has a lower mass - loss rate . while eu del does not appear to be supported by a magnetically driven wind ( section [ magwind ] ) , vy leo may be",
    ". whatever the driving mechanisms involved , the similarity between the outflow velocities of eu del and vy leo adds support to our claim that radiation pressure on dust is ineffective .",
    "we can now turn to other samples to examine the hypothesis of a pulsation - driven dust - enhanced wind .",
    "pulsation amplitude and period are strong functions of effective temperature ( @xcite and eq .",
    "[ woodeq ] , respectively ) .",
    "effective temperature is a function of atmospheric opacity and hence metallicity .",
    "thus , if pulsation amplitude and period are linked to mass - loss rate , we would expect pulsation - driven winds to depend strongly on metallicity .",
    "however , the mass - loss rates of metal - poor rgb stars at these luminosities are largely metallicity independent @xcite .",
    "this independence implies that pulsation - driven winds are not important on the rgb , and that the transition to a dust - producing , pulsation - driven wind only happens on the agb .",
    "this would be observable in the luminosity distribution of dusty sources across the rgb tip .",
    "while the luminosity function of all stars decreases as one moves to brighter stars above the rgb tip , the luminosity function of agb stars should not .",
    "this is tentatively observed in globular clusters already ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "stellar wind theory dictates that , in a pulsation - enhanced , dust - driven wind , the mass - loss rate is set by the pulsations , but the terminal velocity is set by the radiation pressure on dust ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "numerous observations show that more luminous , dustier stars have faster winds , but that few single stars have co lines with velocities below @xmath9510 km s@xmath3 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "few direct observations of terminal wind velocities exist in single stars without pulsation - enhanced winds , due to their low mass - loss rates and lack of condensed molecules .",
    "there are indirect measurements from asymmetries in chromospherically active lines @xcite .",
    "the absorption cores of these lines form above the stellar chromosphere , but typically before the winds have reached their terminal velocity .",
    "they typically show a velocity of a few km s@xmath3 just above the stellar surface , again increasing with luminosity .",
    "near - ir he i line observations of early agb stars indicate a much faster terminal velocity ( @xmath930100 km s@xmath3 ; @xcite ) , implying that the terminal velocity should _ decrease _ with increasing luminosity in the early - agb phase , but these are difficult measurements that are hard to confirm .",
    "we can therefore expect that terminal wind velocities of early - agb stars are either stable and low , or decline with luminosity .",
    "there should then exist an inflection point , or a velocity minimum , after which the wind velocities increase in response to dust driving .",
    "this point should be reached at higher luminosities in metal - poor stars .",
    "eu del and vy leo should straddle this inflection , which probably occurs near 10 km s@xmath3 . further measurements of early - m - type stars likely to occupy this transition region would determine when dust driving is likely to begin .",
    "identification of this point will require accurate luminosities for these sources , which will require accurate distances .",
    "we have observed the co outflow from eu del , finding a wind close to the canonical 10 km s@xmath3 but with a mass - loss rate of a few @xmath7 10@xmath8 m@xmath1 yr@xmath3 .",
    "the metallicity and kinematic origin of eu del require further refinement .",
    "we project it to a relatively metal - poor member of the thin disk population of our galaxy , although the uncertainty on the metallicity is significant . using physical arguments , and by comparison to the similar star vy leo",
    ", we suggest that the wind of eu del is largely driven by stellar pulsation .",
    "radiation pressure on dust does not appear to modify the outflow velocity .",
    "we suggest that eu del is a low - mass agb star that has recently started strong enough mass loss to initiate dust production , thanks to excitation of its 132.6-day , fundamental - mode pulsation .",
