    "stochastic resonance ( sr ) is a resonant phenomenon triggered by noise which can be described as a noise - enhanced signal transmission that occurs in certain non - linear systems  @xcite .",
    "it reveals a context where noise ceases to be a nuisance and is turned into a benefit . loosely speaking",
    "one says that a ( non - linear ) system exhibits sr whenever noise _ benefits _ the system @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the signature of an sr benefit is an inverted - u curve behaviour of the physical variable of interest as a function of the noise strength .",
    "it can take place in systems where the noise helps detecting faint signals .",
    "for example , consider a _",
    "threshold detection _ of a binary - encoded analog signal such that the threshold is set higher than the two signal values .",
    "if there is no noise , then the detector does not recover any information about the encoded signals since they are sub - threshold , and the same occurs if there is too much noise because it will wash out the signal .",
    "thus , there is an optimal amount of noise that will result in maximum performance according to some measure such as signal - to - noise ratio , mutual information , or probability of success .",
    "recently the idea that noise can sometimes play a constructive role like in sr has started to penetrate the quantum information field too . in quantum communication , this possibility has been put forward in refs .",
    "@xcite and more recently in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this",
    "setting it has been shown that information theoretic quantities may `` resonate '' at maximum value for a nonzero level of noise added intentionally .",
    "it is then important to determine general criteria for the occurrence of such phenomenon in quantum information protocols .",
    "continuous variable quantum systems are usually confined to gaussian states and processes , and sr effects are not expected in any linear processing of such systems . however , information is often available in digital ( discrete ) form , and therefore it must be subject to `` de - quantization '' at the input of a continuous gaussian channel and `` quantization '' at the output  @xcite .",
    "these processes are usually involved in the conversion of digital to analog signals and vice versa . since these mappings",
    "are few - to - many and many - to - few , they are inherently non - linear , and similar to the threshold detection described above",
    ". we can thus expect the occurrence of the sr effect in this case .",
    "the simplest model representing such a situation is one in which a binary variable is encoded into the positive and negative parts of a real continuous alphabet and subsequently decoded by a threshold detection  @xcite . in some cases , one may not always have the freedom in choosing the threshold , and in such cases it becomes relevant to know that sr can take place .",
    "this may happen in _ homodyne detection _ if the square of the average signal times the overall detection efficiency ( which accounts for the detector s efficiency , the fraction of the field being measured , etc . )",
    "is below the vacuum noise strength @xcite .",
    "it is also the case in discrimination between lossy channels , where the unknown transmissivities together with a faint signal make it unlikely to optimally choose the threshold value .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a bit encoded into squeezed - coherent states with different amplitudes that are subsequently sent through a gaussian quantum channel ( specifically , a lossy bosonic channel @xcite ) . at the output , the states are subjected to threshold measurement of their amplitude .",
    "in addition to such a setting , we consider one involving entanglement shared by a sender and receiver as well as one involving quantum channel discrimination .",
    "finally , we also consider the sr effect in quantum communication as well as in private communication .",
    "for all of these settings , we determine conditions for the occurrence of the sr effect .",
    "these appear as _ forbidden intervals _ for the threshold detection values .",
    "a `` forbidden interval '' ( or region ) is a range of threshold values for which the sr effect does not occur .",
    "we can illustrate this point by appealing again to the example of threshold detection of a binary - encoded analog signal .",
    "suppose that the signal values are @xmath0 or @xmath1 where @xmath2 .",
    "then if the threshold value @xmath3 is smaller in magnitude than the signal values , so that @xmath4 , the sr effect does not occur  adding noise to the signal will only decrease the performance of the system . in the other case where @xmath5 , adding noise can only increase performance because the signals are indistinguishable when no noise is present . as we said before , adding too much noise will wash out the signals , so that there must be some optimal noise level in this latter case .",
    "our results extend those of refs .",
    "@xcite to other schemes .",
    "remarkably , in the private communication scheme , the width of the forbidden interval can vanish depending on whether the sender or the receiver adds the noise .",
    "this means that in the former case the noise is always beneficial .",
    "let us consider a lossy bosonic quantum channel with transmissivity @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "our aim is to evaluate the probability of successful decoding , considered as a performance measure , when sending classical information through such a channel .",
    "we consider an encoding of the following kind .",
    "let us suppose that the sender uses as input a displaced and squeezed vacuum .",
    "working in the heisenberg picture , the input variable of the communication setup is expressed by the operator : @xmath7 encoding a bit value @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the position quadrature operator , @xmath10 is the displacement amplitude , and @xmath11 is the squeezing parameter @xcite .    under the action of a lossy bosonic channel @xcite with transmissivity @xmath12 the input variable transforms as follows : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the position quadrature operator of an environment mode ( assumed to be in the vacuum state for the sake of simplicity ) .    at the receiver s end , let us consider the possibility of adding a random , gaussian - distributed displacement @xmath15 , with zero mean and variance @xmath16 , to the arriving state .",
    "then , the output observable becomes as follows : @xmath17 notice that we could just as well consider the addition of noise at the sender s end . in that case , the last term @xmath18 of ( [ noiseb ] ) would appear with a factor @xmath19 in front .    upon measurement of the position quadrature operator , the following signal value @xmath20 results @xmath21 following ref .",
    "@xcite , we define a random variable summing up all noise terms : @xmath22 its probability density @xmath23 is the convolution of the probability densities of the random variables @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , these being independent of each other .",

    "we explicitly get @xmath34    the output signal ( [ signal1 ] ) can now be written as @xmath35 the receiver then thresholds the measurement result with a threshold @xmath36 to retrieve a random bit @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the heaviside step function defined as @xmath40 if @xmath41 and @xmath42 if @xmath43 .    to evaluate the probability of successful decoding , we compute the conditional probabilities @xmath44   p_{n}\\left (   n\\right )   \\;dn\\nonumber\\\\ & = & 1-p_{y|x}(1|0 ) \\",

    "( [ eq : qmessage1 ] ) . also , we consider the case in which information is transmitted through a lossy bosonic channel characterized by the transmissivity parameter @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the input variable after the transmission through the noisy channel is hence expressed by eq .",
    "( [ lossych ] ) .",
    "first , suppose that the noise is added at the receiver s end . in this case , the quantity @xmath233 is not affected at all by the noise , and so the behavior of @xmath235 versus @xmath53 is simply determined by @xmath232 .",
    "since this latter relies on the probability of success given by equation ( [ pe1 ] ) , we are in the same situation as in proposition [ prop : unassisted - comm ] . in particular , the private communication rate in eq .",
    "( [ cp ] ) exhibits a non - monotonic behavior as a function of the noise variance if and only if the threshold value @xmath3 lies outside of the forbidden interval @xmath236 $ ] , where @xmath55 are the two roots of equation ( [ eq - p1 ] ) .",
    "second , suppose that the noise is added at the sender s end . in this case ,",
    "equation ( [ noiseb ] ) changes as follows : @xmath237 using a threshold decoding , we get the same expression as in equation ( [ pe1 ] ) for the success probability , upon replacing @xmath238 . from this , it is straightforward to calculate the mutual information @xmath232 . in turn , we assume that the eavesdropper has access to the conjugate mode at the output of the beam - splitter transformation , and so its variable is given by @xmath239 the maximum mutual information between the sender and eavesdropper is given in terms of the holevo information @xcite . since the average state corresponding to the variable ( [ evemode ] ) is non - gaussian , the analytical evaluation of its holevo information appears not to be possible",
    ". however , the monotonicity property of the holevo information under composition of quantum channels ensures that it has to be a monotonically decreasing function of the noise variance @xmath16 . as a consequence",
    ", we expect that its contribution to the private communication rate will increase with increasing value of the noise .",
    "indeed , a numerical analysis suggests that the private communication rate can exhibit a non - monotonic behavior as function of @xmath53 for all values of @xmath3 .",
    "examples of this behavior are shown in figure [ private ] .",
    "we are then led to formulate the following conjecture :    [ forbprivate ] [ the forbidden interval ] the private communication rate @xmath235 shows a non - monotonic behavior as a function of @xmath53 for all @xmath156 if @xmath18 is added at the sender s end .    ) , equation ( [ cp ] ) , versus @xmath53 , for the case of noise added by the sender .",

    "in conclusion , we have determined necessary and sufficient conditions for observing sr when transmitting classical , private , and quantum information over a lossy bosonic channel or when discriminating lossy channels .",
    "nonlinear coding and decoding by threshold mechanisms have been exploited together with the addition of gaussian noise .",
    "specifically , we have considered a bit encoded into coherent states with different amplitudes that are subsequently sent through a lossy bosonic channel and decoded at the output by threshold measurement of their amplitudes ( without and with the assistance of entanglement shared by sender and receiver ) .",
    "we have also considered discrimination of lossy bosonic channels with different loss parameters . in all these cases ,",
    "the performance is evaluated in terms of success probability .",
    "since the mutual information is a monotonic function of this probability , the same conclusions can be drawn in terms of mutual information .",
    "sr effects appear whenever the threshold lies outside of the different forbidden intervals that we have established .",
    "if it lies inside of a forbidden interval , then the sr effect does not occur .",
    "actually , absolute maxima of success probability are obtained when the threshold is set in the middle of the forbidden interval .",
    "generally speaking , sr effects are known to improve analog - to - digital conversion performance @xcite .",
    "in fact , if two distinct signals by continuous - to - binary conversion fall within the same interval they can no longer be distinguished .",
    "in such a situation the addition of a moderate amount of noise turns out to be useful as long as it shifts the signals apart to help in distinguishing them .",
    "while it is important to confirm this possibility also in the quantum framework , we have also shown that the same kind of effects may arise in a purely quantum framework .",
    "indeed , we have also considered the transmission of quantum information , represented by a qubit which is encoded into the state of a bosonic mode and then decoded according to a threshold mechanism .",
    "the found nonmonotonicity of the average channel fidelity and of the output entanglement ( quantified by the logarithmic negativity ) outside the forbidden interval , represents a clear signature of a purely quantum sr effect .    in all the above mentioned cases it does not matter whether the sender or the receiver adds the noise . the exception occurs when the goal is to transmit private information . in fact , by considering achievable rates for private transmission over the lossy channel , we have pointed out that the forbidden interval can change drastically , depending on whether the receiver or the sender adds noise . in the former case ,",
    "it is exactly the same as the case of sending classical ( non private ) information . in the latter case",
    ", we conjecture that it vanishes , i.e. , the noise addition turns out to be beneficial always .",
    "this feature of the private communication rate can be interpreted as a consequence of the asymmetry between the legitimate receiver of the private information and the eavesdropper .",
    "in fact , while the legitimate receiver is restricted to threshold detection , we have allowed the eavesdropper to use more general detection schemes ."
