    "the halo of the milky way is rich with substructure .",
    "large optical surveys have revealed enhancements in the density of stars in the halo which trace out filaments across the sky .",
    "it is believed that each such filament is generated by stars being tidally stripped from a progenitor which has entered the influence of the milky way and hence these structures are called tidal streams .",
    "tidal streams probe the outer parts of the galactic potential , where the potential is expected to be dark - matter dominated . by understanding their formation",
    "it should be possible to constrain properties of the galactic potential @xcite .",
    "one way of approaching this problem has been to assume the members of the stream delineate an orbit @xcite .",
    "if we are given phase - space coordinates for objects that lie at different phases of a single orbit , then the path of the orbit , and hence the underlying potential , may be recovered .",
    "even if the observables are not well known , the orbit and underlying potential can be recovered with reasonable accuracy . if the data lie along an orbit then full six - dimensional phase - space information is redundant : @xcite showed that the orbit and potential could be recovered with positions , distances and line of sight velocities and @xcite did the same with proper motions instead of line of sight velocities .",
    "the technique of orbit fitting to stream data has been utilised most successfully by @xcite who used data for the stream gd-1 @xcite to constrain a simple two - parameter logarithmic potential for the milky way as well as a more complex multi - component milky way potential .",
    "the study of tidal streams has a natural expression in angle - action variables @xcite and in the correct potential a stream should reveal a clear signature in angle - action space . @xcite",
    "discussed and demonstrated the formation of streams in angle - action space through n - body simulations .",
    "the authors investigated the degree to which orbits delineate streams and found that assuming the stream lies along a single orbit can lead to systematic biases in estimates of the potential parameters .",
    "however , these authors were limited to quantifying the degree of misalignment for potentials in which the angle - action coordinates are analytically tractable ( spherical and stckel potentials ) .",
    "the effect of the misalignment in more realistic galactic potentials remains an open question .",
    "in particular , is the misalignment for known streams in the galaxy expected to significantly bias orbit - fitting algorithms ?    in the next section we review the known tidal streams of the milky way and summarise the data from the literature which will be of use in answering this question . in section  [ formalism ]",
    "we present the angle - action formalism and discuss the formation of tidal streams in this framework . in section  [ motivation ]",
    "we motivate the need for an improvement on orbit - fitting algorithms by investigating the degree to which streams delineate orbits in realistic galactic potentials , specifically focussing on which of the known streams can be reliably analysed using orbit - fitting algorithms . in sections  [ massdependence ] and  [ anisotropies ]",
    "we discuss the validity of the presented formalism using n - body simulations and demonstrate the results obtained are independent of the progenitor s mass .",
    "we close by investigating the anticipated errors introduced by orbit - fitting when attempting to constrain the parameters of a two - parameter family of realistic galactic potentials from stream data .",
    "this paper is the first of two papers on the problem of stream - orbit misalignment .",
    "motivated by the results of this paper , the second paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) presents an alternative to orbit - fitting based on the angle - action formalism .",
    "before we discuss the theory of tidal streams and how they may be used to constrain the galactic potential we give a short description of known long streams .",
    "it is important that we understand the available data before we concern ourselves with the details of analysing stream data . for each stream",
    "we have summarised the information from the literature that is useful for the following discussion .",
    "there are other streams , which we have not included .",
    "these streams are associated closely with globular clusters and dwarf galaxies and as such are short and not as useful for constraining the galactic potential .",
    "the majority of the listed streams were discovered using matched - filter star counts @xcite on sloan digital sky survey data ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite detected a @xmath0 stellar stream in sdss data using star counts .",
    "this stream is referred to in the literature as gd-1 .",
    "the stream is extremely narrow , from which the authors conclude that the progenitor was a globular cluster .",
    "however , the progenitor has not been identified suggesting that it has been completely disrupted . because it is exceptionally long and thin , the gd-1 stream has been used by both @xcite and @xcite to constrain the galactic potential . additionally , gd-1 is relatively close to the sun for a tidal stream ( @xmath1 ) , which allowed these authors to construct a full 6d phase - space map of the stream .",
    "both sets of authors used the assumption that the stream delineates an orbit .",
    "the data for gd-1 is currently the best data set for a tidal stream : @xcite provides us with 6d phase - space coordinates for different fields along the stream .",
    "the authors fit an orbit to this stream using a 3-component potential .",
    "the best - fit orbit has its pericentre at @xmath2 , apocentre at @xmath3 and reaches a maximum height above the galactic plane of @xmath4 .",
    "the orphan stream was discovered independently by both @xcite and @xcite using sdss photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "the nearest part of the @xmath5-long stream is @xmath6 from the sun .",
    "the orphan stream is so - called due to the lack of a progenitor .",
    "@xcite suggested that ursa major ii galaxy ( uma ii ) may be the progenitor .",
    "however , using distances and radial velocities @xcite fitted an orbit to the stream which seemed to rule out uma ii as the progenitor .",
    "the more recently discovered star cluster segue-1 @xcite seems a more - likely candidate .",
    "@xcite find a best - fitting orbit for the orphan stream with pericentre at @xmath7 , apocentre at @xmath8 and reaching a maximum height above the galactic plane of @xmath9 .",
    "the anticenter stream was detected by @xcite  as a @xmath10 long overdensity approximately @xmath11 away in the direction of the galactic anticentre .",
    "@xcite concluded that it was not associated with the monoceros ring , despite lying in the same region of the sky , and this conclusion was strengthened by the kinematics measured by @xcite , who measured a 6d phase - space point of the stream .",
    "this single point may be used to construct an approximate orbit for the stream .",
    "a @xmath12 stream was detected by @xcite .",
    "it appears to coincide with the much smaller tidal tails of ngc 5466 found by @xcite , so it is believed to be associated with this extremely metal - poor globular cluster . in this case",
    "we are in the fortunate position of confidently identifying the progenitor and we may use the orbit of the progenitor as a proxy for the path of the stream . an approximate orbit for the progenitor",
    "may be constructed from the 6d coordinates of ngc 5466 given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "palomar 5 ( pal 5 ) is a very low mass , sparse halo cluster lying @xmath13 from the sun , which was found to have short ( @xmath14 ) , strong leading and trailing tidal tails by @xcite .",
    "it was the first example of tidal tails being resolved around a cluster and has received much attention in the literature as an example of the formation of tidal streams @xcite .",
    "further observations found that the stream extended up to @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "as with ngc 5466 , we may use the 6d phase - space coordinates of the progenitor , given by @xcite , to construct an approximate orbit for the progenitor , and hence for the stream members .",
    "the sagittarius dwarf galaxy was discovered by @xcite and is the third largest satellite of the milky way .",
    "@xcite predicted that the sagittarius dwarf would be heavily disrupted , and that debris might be observed in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "@xcite observed extended leading and trailing tidal tails , which @xcite found wrapped at least once around the galaxy .",
    "its length and number of constituent stars make the sagittarius stream useful for constraining the galactic potential",
    ". however , the sagittarius stream is very broad and could potentially reflect the internal properties of the progenitor @xcite .",
    "complex models , which account for dynamical friction ( see later ) , are required to use the sagittarius stream to constrain the galactic potential .",
    "@xcite found that the sagittarius stream had what they dubbed a bifurcation .",
    "these authors were limited to observing the stream in the northern galactic hemisphere .",
    "recently @xcite have extended the observations to the southern galactic hemisphere and found that the bifurcation is also present there .",
    "it is believed that the bifurcation is actually due to a fainter stream which runs alongside the sagittarius stream .",
    "this secondary stream is chemically distinct from the sagittarius stream @xcite , which seems to rule out the possiblity that the secondary stream and the sagittarius stream share a common progenitor .",
    "it is believed that the secondary stream originated from a different progenitor , presumably a companion of sagittarius .",
    "we take the sky coordinates of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy from @xcite , the distance from @xcite , the line - of - sight velocity from @xcite and the proper motions from @xcite , giving us a 6d phase - space point on the orbit of sagittarius .",
    "four streams were discovered by @xcite using a matched - filter technique and were named acheron , cocytos , lethe and styx in order of increasing distance from the sun .",
    "the first three of these are very narrow and lie between @xmath16 and @xmath17 from the sun spanning between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "styx is much more distant ( @xmath20 ) , broader and spans at least @xmath21 .",
    "none of the four streams has an identified progenitor although the styx stream is believed to be associated with the concurrently discovered cluster bootes iii . in the discovery paper @xcite",
    "fits orbits to the available data to predict a 6d phase - space point in each of the streams .",
    "the aquarius stream was detected as an overdensity in the line - of - sight velocity data from the radial velocity experiment ( rave ) by @xcite .",
    "the stream passes very close to the sun ( within @xmath22 ) , is particularly broad and has no identified progenitor .",
    "@xcite fits an orbit to this stream with pericentre at @xmath23 , apocentre at @xmath24 and reaching a maximum height above the galactic plane of @xmath25 .",
    "the cetus stream was discovered by @xcite in velocities from the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue , * ? ? ?",
    "these observations were corroborated by @xcite who observed the cetus stream in the sdss southern galactic hemisphere data .",
    "the stream lies @xmath26 from the sun and follows an approximately polar orbit .",
    "@xcite discovered a faint overdensity in the constellation of virgo from sdss stellar number counts .",
    "the virgo overdensity was also observed as a velocity overdensity in measurements of rr lyrae stars @xcite .",
    "the overdensity has a large spatial extent but it is unclear whether it is a stream or not .",
    "the triangulum stream was very recently discovered by @xcite by searching sdss data using a matched - filter technique .",
    "the stream extends over @xmath27 and lies approximately @xmath3 from the sun .",
    "these three streams do not have sufficient data in the literature to reliably construct their 6d phase - space structure .",
    "a simple orbit fit may be possible but this is beyond the scope of this exercise .",
    "@xcite and @xcite explained the formation of tidal streams in angle - action space . in this formulation streams",
    "are formed because stars do not share a common orbit .",
    "it is this formulation which we present here .",
    "given 6d phase - space information , the angle - action coordinates for each star along the tidal stream may be found .",
    "we assume that each star does not feel the gravitational influence of the stars in the stream but only the external galactic potential .",
    "angle - action variables provide a simple way to follow the dynamics of the stream as the actions are constants of the motion whilst the angles increase linearly in time . for a single star in the stream ,",
    "the angle - action coordinates , @xmath28 , obey the equations @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the frequencies of the hamiltonian , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the time since the star was stripped from the progenitor .",
    "all the stars in the stream are assumed to derive from a progenitor with actions @xmath33 .",
    "the progenitor is assumed to be of low mass so that we may neglect dynamical friction , and the actions of the progenitor are constant throughout the motion . also , we assume that once a star has been stripped , the influence of the progenitor can be neglected so the star s actions are constant from the time the star was stripped .",
    "the stream is formed by the difference in angles between the progenitor and the stars in the stream , @xmath34 , increasing with time . for a single star we have @xmath35",
    "@xmath36 is the initial difference in angles between the progenitor and a given star .",
    "@xmath37 is the difference in frequencies .",
    "both @xmath36 and @xmath37 depend upon the progenitor mass ( see section  [ massdependence ] ) .",
    "when a stream has formed , @xmath36 has become small compared to the term @xmath38 so we have @xmath39 as the frequencies and the angles depend on the potential , this equation provides a constraint for the potential .",
    "however checking whether this equation is obeyed for all stars in the stream in a given potential is complicated for two reasons :    the progenitor of the stream may be unknown , and    the time that the star left the progenitor , @xmath32 , is not known .",
    "nevertheless , equation   provides a useful constraint on the potential .",
    "if the difference between the actions of the stream stars and those of the progenitor is small , the frequencies of a stream star are well approximated by the taylor expansion @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the hessian matrix @xmath42 this matrix is symmetric , so at each point of action space it is characterised by three orthogonal eigenvectors , @xmath43 , with associated real eigenvalues , @xmath44 . with the taylor series for the frequencies given in equation  , the difference in angles is related to the difference in actions by @xmath45 in this framework we can understand the conditions required for a stream to form .",
    "once a star has been stripped from the cluster , the action difference , @xmath46 , is frozen in and the angle difference increases with time .",
    "the hessian determines along which directions the cluster spreads . for a long thin stream to form from an approximately isotropic cluster in action space",
    ", one eigenvalue of the hessian must be much larger than the other two , @xmath47 . in this case",
    "the stream will stretch along the eigenvector @xmath48 and @xmath49 hence the frequency difference should be aligned with the principal eigenvector of the hessian for all stars in the stream , independent of their action .",
    "we have seen that if the hessian matrix is dominated by a single eigenvalue , @xmath50 , the stream will stretch along the corresponding eigenvector , @xmath48 . in general this vector will be misaligned with the progenitor frequency vector , @xmath51 , with the angle , @xmath52 , between them given by @xmath53 the misalignment between these two vectors gives an indication of the error expected when the galactic potential is constrained by assuming that the stream delineates an orbit .",
    "the potential in which the stream appears to delineate an orbit will , in general , be different to the true potential .",
    "orbit - fitting algorithms also assume that the actions of all the constituent stars are the same which can also lead to errors .",
    "however , this effect is small , as the stream spans a small range in actions , so we assume that the misalignment angle gives rise to all the error in orbit - fitting algorithms .",
    "importantly , this misalignment is independent of the progenitor mass , and depends only on the progenitor orbit , and hence the underlying potential ( see section  [ massdependence ] ) . moving to lower - mass , and hence narrower streams , does not decrease the misalignment .",
    "one key result of @xcite is that when this misalignment is @xmath54 in the isochrone potential , the mass of the galaxy is overestimated by approximately @xmath55 when using an orbit - fitting algorithm .",
    "thus , even a small value of @xmath52 can lead to significant error in the potential .",
    "@xcite found the misalignment angle to be @xmath56 at every point in action space in the isochrone potential , whereas in a stckel potential the angle was as large as @xmath57 .",
    "these are special cases so it is necessary to explore the magnitude of this angle for realistic galaxy potentials to assess the need to go beyond orbit - fitting algorithms .",
    "we calculate @xmath52 by first finding the hessian matrix at each point in action - space .",
    "this calculation is simply performed using the torus machine @xcite .",
    "the torus machine constructs orbital tori of given actions for a general potential .",
    "position and velocity coordinates are determined as functions of the angles on the surface of the torus .",
    "given a set of actions the torus machine returns the corresponding frequencies .",
    "it is these properties which make it an appropriate tool for this task .",
    "for each point in action - space we use the torus machine to differentiate estimates of the frequency numerically .",
    "the error in the estimated actions of points that lie on a torus created by the torus machine is estimated as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the rms variation in the energy across the torus and @xmath60 are the frequencies . for each action - space point",
    "we create a torus with the required actions , @xmath61 , and accuracy , @xmath62 , as well as neighbouring tori which lie @xmath63 away from the action - space point in each action - space direction .",
    "we use the calculated frequencies of these tori to construct numerically the hessian matrix , @xmath64 , at the action - space point .",
    "we require @xmath65 to ensure the numerical differentiation is accurate .",
    "the angle between the principal eigenvector of this matrix and the frequency vector at the action - space point is @xmath52 .",
    "we also calculate @xmath66 which gives a measure of the width of a stream formed at this action - space point .",
    "if this ratio is large , a long thin stream forms and equation   is satisfied .",
    "however , if the ratio is small , the stream will be broad .    for a given choice of @xmath62 and @xmath63 the error in @xmath52 is estimated by calculating it for a known case . in the kepler potential",
    "the angle is zero @xcite and we use this fact to estimate the error in @xmath52 in a general potential .",
    "we perform the above procedure on two potentials : the two - parameter logarithmic potential and the best - fit potential from @xcite ( hereafter referred to as pjm11 ) .",
    "the logarithmic potential is defined as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the asymptotic circular speed and @xmath69 is the flattening parameter .",
    "we choose @xmath70 and @xmath71 which gives a good representation of the potential of the milky way @xcite .",
    "the pjm11 potential is a multi - component potential generated by a bulge , thick and thin discs and a halo , which has been fitted to current experimental constraints .",
    "[ log ] and fig .",
    "[ pjm11 ] show @xmath52 and the eigenvalue ratio in two action planes for these two potentials ] .",
    "@xmath72    @xmath73    for the logarithmic potential @xmath52 is small ( about @xmath74 ) , but crucially non - zero at all points in the action - space planes explored .",
    "this is similar to the value found by @xcite for the isochrone potential .",
    "@xmath52 decreases with increasing @xmath75 and increasing @xmath76 as orbits move further out in the potential , but the trend is very subtle .",
    "the errors in @xmath52 are @xmath77 . the eigenvalue ratio , @xmath66 , is greater than @xmath78 for all action - space points shown .",
    "therefore , we expect long thin streams which are misaligned with the orbit of their progenitor .    for the pjm11 potential @xmath52",
    "is @xmath79 for all the action - space points shown in fig .",
    "[ pjm11 ] , and can be as large as @xmath80 for orbits with low @xmath75 .",
    "these low-@xmath75 orbits are planar disc - like orbits so clearly the discs in the pjm11 potential have a large effect on the misalignment angle . for these orbits",
    "the ratio of eigenvalues is small so broad structures will form from debris stripped from disc - like orbits .",
    "@xmath52 decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath75 such that for orbits which spend most of their time out in the halo , @xmath52 has a similar value to that found for the logarithmic and isochrone potentials",
    ". similarly the ratio of the eigenvalues increases with increasing @xmath75 . in the halo",
    ", long thin streams will form .",
    "the planes of constant @xmath75 show that orbits with large @xmath76 will form narrower streams which are more aligned with their progenitor orbit .",
    "interestingly , despite the magnitudes of @xmath52 being similar far out in the halo , the shapes of the @xmath52 surface and the @xmath66 surface are very different for the two potentials .    in both potentials examined here ,",
    "@xmath52 is a few degrees far out in the halo .",
    "however , for the pjm11 potential , this can increase to several tens of degrees for orbits which spend more time in the disc .",
    "therefore , simulations which use the logarithmic potential may not give a good representation of the evolution of a tidal stream .",
    "the stream will potentially delineate the orbit more than it should in a realistic potential giving the impression that orbit - fitting algorithms are appropriate .",
    "we note that both the logarithmic potential used here and the pjm11 potential have approximately spherical halo potentials . with more halo flattening",
    "we expect the misalignment angle will increase ( c.f .",
    "the stckel potential analysed by * ? ? ? * ) .      we have seen that @xmath52 is definitely non - zero and can be large for realistic galaxy potentials , and thus systematic errors can be made when an orbit - fitting algorithm is used .",
    "we now explore the magnitude of the misalignment angle for the known streams described in section  [ knownstreams ] to decide whether orbit - fitting algorithms are appropriate for analysing available stream data . for this task",
    "we must make estimates of their actions and then use the torus machinery as above .    with the information collected in section  [ knownstreams ]",
    "we can construct approximate 6d phase - space points for each of the streams .",
    "for those streams with known progenitors ( palomar 5 , sagittarius , ngc 5466 ) we use the 6d coordinates of the progenitor .",
    "the acheron , cocytos , lethe and styx streams have predicted 6d stream points from an orbit fit by @xcite .",
    "the anticenter stream has a single measured 6d stream coordinate .",
    "the remaining streams ( gd-1 , orphan , aquarius ) have approximate orbit fits from the literature . in our chosen potential",
    "we can produce similar orbits and find a single 6d point on these orbits .",
    "the actions in the pjm11 potential for each of these points are found using the stckel - fitting algorithm from @xcite ( this algorithm is briefly discussed in the appendix of paper ii ) .",
    "there is an error of @xmath81 in the actions introduced by the stckel - fitting algorithm , but this is irrelevant when compared with the observational uncertainties in the coordinates of these streams . with these actions we find @xmath52 to a precision of better than @xmath82 using the torus machine .",
    "for each stream table  [ streamactiontable ] gives the approximate actions , the ratio of the two largest eigenvalues of the hessian and @xmath52 .",
    "the misalignment angle varies from @xmath83 to @xmath84 with the largest misalignment angle producing the smallest eigenvalue ratio , and hence the broadest streams .",
    "the anticenter , aquarius and ngc 5466 streams all have @xmath85 and small eigenvalue ratios ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "therefore , just from their actions we anticipate that the streams formed will be broad .",
    "this is definitely true of the aquarius stream , and the anticenter stream is a complex which is believed to consist of three separate streams with the whole complex having a width of @xmath87 @xcite . for all other streams we find @xmath88 and",
    "the eigenvalue ratio is large ( @xmath89 ) so narrow streams are expected .",
    "when presenting the angle - action formalism of stream formation we made little mention of the progenitor mass .",
    "we would like to know for what range of progenitor masses this approach and the above results are valid .",
    "stream progenitor masses span a large range : gd-1 is observed to have a mass of @xmath90 @xcite , whilst the sagittarius dwarf is believed to be @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "here we discuss each of the assumptions made in the angle - action formalism in the context of mass - dependence :    the progenitor actions are assumed to be constant for all time .",
    "this is valid in the limit that dynamical friction is negligible .",
    "we can neglect dynamical friction if we are in the regime where @xmath92 where @xmath68 is the circular speed of the potential , and @xmath93 is the pericentre radius .",
    "this mass is approximately @xmath94 for a gd-1-like orbit , so we expect this effect to be negligible for @xmath95 .",
    "many streams lie much further out in the halo where this limit is expected to be much larger . additionally , the effects of dynamical friction are expected to be comparable for the cluster and the stream , such that the relative structure of the stream is not affected , but the global cluster - stream complex is .",
    "we expect that dynamical friction is irrelevant for most streams , but its effects on the sagittarius stream may be important @xcite .",
    "we have assumed that a particle is instantaneously released from the cluster , and subsequently has constant actions .",
    "however , the self - gravity of the cluster will always be significant , regardless of mass .",
    "it is the self - gravity of the cluster which determines whether a particle leaves the cluster on each pericentric passage .",
    "a particle will always leave the cluster in the same way ( approximately through the lagrange points at pericentre ) , irrespective of the mass . in the absence of self - gravity",
    "we do not have this restriction as particles leave the cluster more uniformly .",
    "therefore , we expect that the inclusion of self - gravity will have an impact on the overall shape of the angle - action space structure of the stream , independent of the mass ( see  [ anisotropies ] ) .",
    "we also expect that increased cluster self - gravity will produce broader streams as particles leave the cluster with a larger range of actions .",
    "thus the role of progenitor mass is to set the scale of the stream s structure without affecting its morphology in any other way . despite the cluster self - gravity always being important , it should produce mass - independent effects on the overall shape of the stream ( see below ) .",
    "we assume that we can neglect the finite angle size of the cluster , @xmath36 after some time @xmath32 as it is negligible compared to the contribution of secular evolution to @xmath34 .",
    "assuming the secular evolution of the stream stretches the angle distribution along one direction ( see below ) @xmath36 will act to broaden the stream perpendicular to this principal direction .",
    "this is mass - dependent , and is related to the above self - gravity arguments , but when a stream has formed this term is always unimportant .",
    "as long as initial spread in angles is symmetric about the stream path this term will not affect the presented formalism .",
    "we employ a taylor expansion in @xmath46 when finding the relationship between the frequencies and actions .",
    "this is important as it leads to the conclusion that @xmath37 for each particle will lie along the same vector @xmath48 .",
    "this assumption is valid provided @xmath96 if the hamiltonian is a function of some low power of @xmath61 then this reduces to @xmath97    if we are in the progenitor - mass regime where we can neglect the above effects , what effect does the progenitor mass have on the resulting angle - action space distribution ?",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath37 and @xmath34 are all functions of the progenitor mass .",
    "we expect that larger progenitor masses produce larger spreads in the actions , frequencies and angles of the resulting stream , but we would like to know their exact mass dependence . following",
    "@xcite we have that @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the velocity dispersion of the progenitor . for axisymmetric systems",
    "this is approximately @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the difference between the apocentric and pericentre radius , and @xmath102 is the maximum height above the plane reached by the orbit .",
    "@xmath103 is calculated at pericentre as this is where the majority of particles are stripped . under the assumption of equation  ,",
    "@xmath37 is linearly related to @xmath46 via the ( mass - independent ) hessian @xmath104 , and @xmath34 is linearly related to @xmath37 via the time since stripping , @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , both @xmath37 and @xmath34 will have the same dependence on mass as @xmath46 .    from the virial theorem",
    "we relate the velocity dispersion of the cluster to its mass and radius via @xmath105 and the tidal radius , @xmath106 , is related to the mass of the cluster via @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the mass of the host galaxy contained within @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , the progenitor mass is proportional to the velocity dispersion cubed or @xmath109 . as @xmath46 , @xmath34 and @xmath37",
    "are proportional to @xmath99 in the regime we are considering , we expect all these quantities to also depend on @xmath110 .",
    "@xcite showed from n - body simulations that the energy difference of stripped particles obeyed this same scaling with progenitor mass in a spherical halo .",
    "similarly , @xcite demonstrated that the density profile along a stream was described by the same analytic form scaled by @xmath110 , and @xcite utilised this scaling relation to develop a semi - analytic formalism for predicting the morphology of a recently formed stream .",
    "these arguments convince us that the progenitor mass acts only to scale the angle - frequency distribution , and the shape is independent of the mass , provided we are in the aforementioned regime .",
    "therefore , the misalignment angle is mass - independent .    using these results",

    "to be stripped it must leave the cluster through the lagrange points l1 and l2 at pericentre . for the orbit considered ,",
    "the motion is dominated by the radial motion , and at pericentre the lagrange points lie in a plane which is nearly parallel to the plane @xmath168 .",

    "this increased radial motion will in turn increase / decrease the radial frequency @xmath169 depending on whether the particle leaves through l1 or l2 . similarly the angular frequency @xmath170 will increase / decrease as the particle moves to a smaller / larger radius without changing its transverse velocity . if we consider the motion in @xmath171 to be completely decoupled from the radial motion , which in the orbit considered is a fair assumption , increased motion in @xmath172 as the particle leaves the cluster will not alter the vertical action @xmath75 and frequency @xmath173 .",

    "however , the misalignment for the known streams is still shown to be non - negligible when the effects of self - gravity are included .    the angle - action formalism is a clear framework in which to view and discuss stream formation . it has enabled us to quantify the errors involved in orbit - fitting methods for interesting potentials and led to the conclusion that orbit - fitting algorithms are not appropriate when analysing many streams in the milky way .",
