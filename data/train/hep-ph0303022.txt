    "one way to analyze the microscopic structure of atomic nuclei is to study the distribution of quarks and gluons , as well as their correlations , in nuclei .",
    "these nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdfs ) can be accessed using various deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) processes : inclusive scattering of leptons , high - mass dimuon production using proton beams , exclusive electroproduction of vector mesons .",
    "none of the above processes determines npdfs comprehensively , only taken together do these experiments provide stringent constraints on npdfs .",
    "the discussion of the present paper is centered around the nuclear effects of nuclear shadowing and antishadowing ( enhancement ) , which affect npdfs at small values of bjorken variable @xmath5 , @xmath12 .",
    "nuclear shadowing of npdfs is developing into an increasingly important subject because it is involved in the interpretation of the rhic data on jet production , evaluation of hard phenomena in proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions at the lhc , estimates of the black limit scattering regime in dis , etc .",
    "the major obstacle that hinders our deeper knowledge of npdfs at small @xmath5 is that , up to the present day , all experiments aiming to study npdfs are performed with fixed ( stationary ) nuclear targets . in these data , the values of @xmath5 and @xmath13 are strongly correlated and one measures npdfs essentially along a curve in the @xmath14 plane rather than exploring the entire plane .",

    "when one attempts to globally fit the available data by modeling npdfs at some initial scale @xmath17 and then performing qcd evolution , various groups @xcite produce significantly different results .",
    "an alternative to the fitting to the data is to combine the gribov theory @xcite , which relates the nuclear shadowing correction to the total hadron - deuteron cross section to the cross section of diffraction off a free nucleon , with the collins factorization theorem  @xcite for hard diffraction in dis .",
    "the resulting leading twist theory of nuclear shadowing was developed in @xcite and later elaborated on in @xcite .",
    "the gribov theory has been applied to the description of nuclear shadowing for many years .",
    "first it was done in the region of small @xmath13 , where generalized vector dominance model gives a good description of diffraction , see review in @xcite , and later in deep inelastic region , where large diffractive masses @xmath18 dominate @xcite .",
    "a number of successful model calculations were performed @xcite before the experimental data from hera became available . a calculation constrained to reproduce",

    "a fair agreement of the data with the gribov theory has been found .",
