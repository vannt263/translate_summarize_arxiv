    "one of the main goals in the study of heterotic string compactifications is to understand how the dimensional reduction of the ten - dimensional @xmath9 supersymmetric yang  mills gauge sector can be used to fix the multitude of free parameters present in the higgs and yukawa sectors of the standard model , and its extensions .",

    "again , without an explicit construction of the non - constant spinor zero - modes on @xmath11 it is not possible to be more specific , but the important point here is that the choice of almost khler structure on the internal coset space influences the yukawa interactions in the dimensionally reduced field theory . whether or not the choice of nearly khler structure described in ",

    "the study is motivated by heterotic string theory , and although our model lacks two features of that theory ( we use the gauge group @xmath242 rather than @xmath12 and we do not insist on supersymmetry ) we believe that the model retains enough of the features of the heterotic model for the analysis to be instructive .",

    "the higgs potential in particular has the exciting new feature of having vacua corresponding to solitonic solutions , opening up the possibility of higgs masses that are inversely proportional to the gauge coupling , ( [ solitonmass ] )  a new aspect of the higgs mechanism that has not been noticed before .",
    "we have also analysed the yukawa couplings as functions of the moduli and computed induced fermion mass matrices arising from dynamical symmetry breaking , although only in some specific cases , since the general case is technically formidable and beyond our present techniques .",
