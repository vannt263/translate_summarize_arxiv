    "we do not consider the tensor structure here and restrict our attention to dimension-6 operators involving quark bilinears . in the case of a linear realization of the higgs sector",
    "the operator must be invariant under the full electroweak gauge group @xmath14 which means that only the spinor structure @xmath15 is relevant . for a non - linear realization of the gauge group , which is natural for a strongly coupled electroweak symmetry breaking sector @xcite ,",

    "we also note that as ongoing experimental searches for rare @xmath2 decay modes reach higher levels of precision ( see for example @xcite ) , almost half of the bounds listed in table 2 will become more stringent . as mentioned previously , searches for @xmath29 in charmonium and bottomonium decays may help to constrain some of the operators for which we could at present find no limits .",
