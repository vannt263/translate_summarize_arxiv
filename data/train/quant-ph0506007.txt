    "the damped harmonic oscillator is one of the simplest quantum systems displaying the dissipation of energy .",
    "moreover , it is of great physical importance and has found many applications especially in quantum optics .",
    "for example it plays a central role in the quantum theory of lasers and masers @xcite .",
    "as is well known there is no room for the dissipative phenomena in the standard hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "the schrdinger equation defines one - parameter unitary group and hence the quantum dynamics is perfectly time - reversible .",
    "the usual approach to include dissipation is the quantum theory of open systems @xcite . in this approach",
    "the dynamics of a quantum system is no longer unitary but it is defined by a semigroup of completely positive maps in the space of density operators @xcite ( for recent reviews see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there is , however , another way to describe dissipative quantum systems based on the old idea of bateman @xcite .",
    "bateman has shown that to apply the standard canonical formalism of classical mechanics to dissipative and non - hamiltonian systems , one can double the numbers of degrees of freedom , so as to deal with an effective isolated classical hamiltonian system .",
    "the new degrees of freedom may be assumed to represent a reservoir .",
    "applying this idea to damped harmonic oscillator one obtains a pair of damped oscillators ( so called bateman s dual system ) : a primary one and its time reversed image .",
    "the bateman dual hamiltonian has been rediscovered by morse and feshbach @xcite and bopp @xcite and the detailed quantum mechanical analysis was performed by feshbach and tikochinski @xcite .",
    "the quantum bateman system was then analyzed by many authors ( see the detailed historical review @xcite with almost 600 references ! ) .",
    "surprisingly , this system is still worth to study and it shows its new interesting features .",
    "recently it was analyzed in @xcite in connection with quantum field theory and quantum groups ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "different approach based on the chern - simons theory was applied in @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite",
    "a damped oscillator was quantized by using feynman path integral formulation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the corresponding geometric phase was calculated and found to be directly related to the ground - state energy of the standard one - dimensional linear harmonic oscillator .",
    "bateman s system has been also studied as a toy model for the recent proposal by t hooft about deterministic quantum mechanics @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we propose a slightly different approach to the bateman system .",
    "the unusual feature of the bateman hamiltonian is that being a self - adjoint operator it displays a family of complex eigenvalues .",
    "we show that these eigenvalues correspond to the poles of energy eigenvectors and the corresponding resolvent operator when continued to the complex energy plane .",
    "the similar analysis for the toy model of a quantum damped system was performed in @xcite .",
    "eigenvectors corresponding to the poles of the resolvent are well known in the scattering theory as resonant states @xcite .",
    "it shows that the appearance of resonances is responsible for the dissipation in the bateman system . obviously , the time evolution is perfectly reversible when considered on the corresponding system hilbert space @xmath0 .",
    "it is given by the 1-parameter group of unitary transformations @xmath1 .",
    "it turns out that there are two natural subspaces @xmath2 such that @xmath3 restricted to @xmath4 defines only two semigroups : @xmath5 on @xmath6 , and @xmath7 on @xmath8 .",

    "is directly related to the old observation of pontriagin @xcite ( see section  [ sec - pontr ] for review ) that any non - hamiltonian system of the form @xmath10 may be treated as a hamiltonian one in the extended phase - space @xmath11 with the hamiltonian @xmath12 note , that the above hamiltonian has exactly the form considered by t hooft @xcite .    from the mathematical point of view",
    "the natural language to analyze the bateman system is the so called rigged hilbert space approach to quantum mechanics @xcite .",

    "as is well known any dynamical system may be regarded as a part of a larger hamiltonian system .",
    "approach is based on adding to the primary system a time reversed ( dual ) copy .",
    "together they define a hamiltonian system .",
    "there exists , however , a general approach to canonical quantization of non - hamiltonian systems based on an old observation of pontriagin @xcite .",
    "suppose we are given an arbitrary non - hamiltonian system described by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a vector field on some configuration space @xmath52 .",
    "for simplicity assume that @xmath53 , that is , the system has @xmath54 degrees of freedom .",
    "this system may be lifted to the hamiltonian system on the phase space @xmath55 as follows : one defines the hamiltonian @xmath56 by @xmath57 where @xmath58 denote canonical coordinates on @xmath59 .",
    "the corresponding hamilton equations read as follows : @xmath60 for @xmath61 . in the above formulae @xmath62",
    "denotes the standard poisson bracket on @xmath59 @xmath63 clearly , the formulae ( [ ham-1 ] ) reproduce our initial dynamical system ( [ dotx - x ] ) on @xmath52 .",
    "the canonical quantization is now straightforward . assuming the symmetric weyl ordering one obtains the following formula for the quantum hamiltonian @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the wigner - weyl transform of a space - phase function @xmath66 .",
    "recall , that the wigner - weyl transform of @xmath67 is defined as follows @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath70 .",
    "clearly , @xmath71 defines a schrdinger system in @xmath72 .",

    "one may ask what is the relation between bateman s hamiltonian ( [ bham ] ) and that obtained via pontriagin procedure ( [ h - osc - d ] ) .",
    "surprisingly they are related by the following simple canonical transformation @xmath84 :    @xmath85    assuming the symmetric weyl ordering one obtains the following representation of the quantum bateman s hamiltonian ( [ hhh ] ) with @xmath86 and @xmath87",

    "the corresponding generalized eigenvectors let us note that in polar representation the hilbert space @xmath111 of square integrable functions in @xmath74 factorizes as follows : @xmath112 therefore , the spectral problem splits into two separate problems in @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",

    "now , using ( [ psi - n - lambda ] ) one obtains @xmath131 where the radial and azimuthal propagators are given by @xmath132 and @xmath133 respectively .",
    "finally , formulae ( [ phi - n ] ) and ( [ r - lambda ] ) imply @xmath134 and @xmath135 therefore , the time evolution is given by @xmath136 which perfectly agrees with ( [ u - t ] ) .",
    "now we are going to relate the energy eigenvectors @xmath137 corresponding to the real spectrum @xmath138 with the family of discrete complex eigenvalues of the bateman s hamiltonian .",

    "what is the physical meaning of the complex eigenvalues @xmath249 ? to answer this question let us consider the resolvent operator of the bateman s",

    "finally , let us turn to the evolution generated by the bateman s hamiltonian .",

    "we have shown that perfectly reversible quantum dynamics @xmath282 on the full hilbert space @xmath283 is no longer reversible when restricted to the subspaces @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",

    "therefore , the corresponding generalized eigenvectors may be interpreted as resonant states of the bateman dual system .",
    "it proves that dissipation and irreversibility is caused by the presence of resonances .    from the mathematical point of view",
    "the bateman system gives rise to the so called gelfand triplet or rigged hilbert space @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a gelfand triplet ( rigged hilbert space ) is a collection of spaces @xmath287 where @xmath111 is a hilbert space , @xmath288 its dense subspace and @xmath289 is the dual space of continuous linear functionals on @xmath288 .",
