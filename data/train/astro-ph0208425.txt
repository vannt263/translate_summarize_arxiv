    "overall , a brightening of the characteristic magnitude is observed for galaxies in groups with a statistical significance @xmath77 .",
    "this is particularly significant for type 1 galaxies that are the main contributors to the general lf of galaxies in groups ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the denser environment of groups could be thought as the natural responsible of this brightening .",
    "in this particular environment , galaxy mergers seems to be the most probable cause since tidal interactions are more effective when the galaxy encounter is slow .",
    "the later situation , is more frequently observed in groups where smaller velocity dispersions contrast with the high velocity dispersions observed in rich clusters .",
    "other processes , as ram - pressure ( abadi , moore & bower 1999 ) or galaxy harassment ( moore et al .",
    "1996 ) should not be as effective as in rich cluster where the intra - cluster gas is much denser and the interaction rate is higher . + nevertheless , the processes mentioned above may be important in the generation of red low mass galaxies , that are possibly the remnants of dynamical stripped galaxies in high mass systems and can be the responsible for the steepening of the luminosity function in clusters .",
    "the observed difference in the @xmath53 parameter for type 1 galaxies ( lower panel of figure [ comp ] ) may be explained in this framework . in order to test this scenario , we reanalyze the lf for non star - forming galaxies ( type 1 ) splitting the sample in high ( @xmath79 ) and low ( @xmath80 ) group mass subsets . a significant difference is observed at the faint end slope of the lf from this comparison , resulting schechter @xmath53 parameters of ( @xmath81 ) and ( @xmath82 ) for high and low mass subsamples respectively ( figure [ type1 ] ) .",
    "these results may support our hypothesis that in groups , mergers are probably responsible for the @xmath11 brightening , meanwhile process as the ram - pressure and galaxy harassment could generate the increase at the lf faint end slope as observed for non - star forming galaxies in high mass systems . besides the steepening of the faint end slope of type 1 galaxies lf in higher mass systems , the galaxy lf for high and low mass groups do not differ appreciatively between them showing roughly the same behaviour as the overall lf of galaxies in groups ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .    despite the differences between the resulting luminosity functions per spectral type ,",
    "the general lf of galaxies in groups is quite similar to that of 2df field galaxies obtained by norberg et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and madgwick et al .",
    "this behaviour could be possibly due to the different relative abundances of type 1 galaxies in the field and groups . in groups type",
    "1 galaxies are by far the dominant population , consequently , these galaxies almost determine by themselves @xmath11 . meanwhile , in the field , types 2 , 3 and 4 contribute more strongly to the lf , generating a @xmath11 brighter than the corresponding to type 1 galaxies alone .",
    "regarding the faint end slope of the overall lf , the main contributors are late type galaxies ( except for high mass groups , as stated above ) in both , field and groups .",
    "since there are no significant differences between the @xmath53 parameters for late types in the field and groups , then the overall faint end slopes are similar .",
    "the next step in this work is to analyse the luminosity distribution of groups independently of the detailed arrangement of luminous material within each object . in this section",
    "we determine individual group luminosities that allow us the computation of the group luminosity function and the subsequent comparison with previous determinations and predictions from semianalytical models of galaxy formation .",
    "we compute group luminosities following the prescription by moore , frenk & white ( 1993 ) . for each group the total luminosity , @xmath83 ,",
    "is the sum of the luminosities of the galaxy members ( @xmath84 ) plus the integrated luminosity of galaxies below the magnitude limit of the survey ( @xmath85 ) @xmath86 in the computation of @xmath87 we assume that group members are independently drawn from the previously computed schechter fit to the luminosity function of galaxies in groups .",
    "consequently , the expected luminosity of faint group members is @xmath88 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( @xmath92 band ) .",
    "the reliability of this scheme for computing luminosities of virialized systems was widely tested by moore , frenk & white ( 1993 ) using groups from the cfa catalogue and flux and volume limited mock catalogues . in order to apply this procedure to our group catalogue",
    "we introduce some changes that take into account the particular sky coverage of the parent catalogue : @xmath93 is a function of the angular position of the group and @xmath94 , where the sum extends over the group members and each member is weighted with the inverse of the redshift completeness , @xmath95 , at its angular position .      as a first step in computing the group luminosity function using the @xmath30 method , it is necessary to find out the completeness limit in group apparent magnitude of our catalogue .",

    "we have defined group luminosities following moore , frenk & white ( 1993 ) , as the sum of its observed luminosity plus a normalised integral of the galaxy luminosity function below the flux limit of the survey .",
    "this definition has proved to be reliable in the computation of group total luminosity using observations and artificial flux and volume - limited catalogues .",
    "the main aim of this computation is the determination of the luminosity function for our group catalogue . since the @xmath152 method for luminosity function estimation requires a fair selection criterion , we have used the rauzy ( 2001 ) @xmath112 statistics to determine an apparent magnitude cut - off for the 2dfggc that ensures the highest level of completeness .",
    "our final flux - limited group sample comprises 922 groups with apparent magnitudes brighter than @xmath153 ( figure [ rauzy ] ) .",
    "the resulting group luminosity function for this sample ( figure [ grouplf ] ) is consistent with moore , frenk & white ( 1993 ) determination for groups in the cfa redshift survey and with the semianalytical model prediction of a @xmath125 cold dark matter cosmology performed by benson et al .",
    "this agreement is acceptable in the luminosity range @xmath154 .",
    "the differences observed at fainter luminosities are mainly due to the lack of groups with less than 4 members in the 2dfggc .",
    "the intrinsic characteristics of the group finding algorithm used in the construction of the 2dfggc by merchn & zandivarez ( 2002 ) , determine that below this limit any resulting sample has an unacceptable level of contamination by spurious detections .",
    "the flux - limited group sample adopted in the luminosity function computation is also fair enough for the determination of the group mass function .",
    "this determination was achieved by using an adapted version of the @xmath128 that considers the sky coverage of the group sample .",
    "finally , a comparison with analytical predictions of halo abundances is made using a simple scheme to relate group virial masses and that corresponding to the adequate overdensity in our cosmological model .",
    "the results are displayed in figure [ fig6 ] , where it can be seen a notorious agreement with the press & schechter ( 1974 ) , sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) and jenkins et al .",
    "( 2001 ) mass functions for masses @xmath155 .",
    "again , the disagreement for low masses can be attributed to absence of poor groups .",
    "the statistical significance of the group catalogue used in this work allowed us to obtain very important clues about internal properties of intermediate mass systems and also to observe the level of agreement obtained from both analytical and semianalytical predictions in the framework of a @xmath125 cold dark matter model .",
    "we are indebted with diego g. lambas and hernn muriel for interesting comments and discussions .",
