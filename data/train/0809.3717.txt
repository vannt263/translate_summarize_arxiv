    "the radiative decay of mesons has been traditionally advocated as a good tool to investigate the nature of the controversial mesons .",
    "in particular the decay into @xmath3 has had a special attention @xcite .",
    "the scalar mesons have been those most thoroughly studied given the on going debate on whether they are @xmath4 states , tetraquarks , or meson - meson molecules as a particular case of the more general one , dynamically generated states from the meson - meson interaction in coupled channels , see @xcite for a recent review .    in this work",
    "we want to call the attention to two particular mesons , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states , because in a recent paper @xcite the two mesons were found as dynamically generated states from the @xmath5 interaction in the hidden gauge approach for the vector mesons @xcite .",
    "the attraction was stronger in the spin s=2 channel than in the scalar one , but in both channels there was enough attraction to generate bound states .",
    "in other channels the interaction was either very weak or repulsive , such that these two states stand as particular cases which can be viewed as largely being @xmath5 molecules in that framework .",
    "it is interesting to see how this idea immediately leads one to evaluate rather accurately the partial decay width of the two states into @xmath3 and this is the purpose of this paper .    although ref .",
    "@xcite contains the first theoretical evaluation of the @xmath2 bound system , it is interesting to recall that , based on phenomenological properties ( the large @xmath6 versus @xmath7 ) , the @xmath2 molecular nature of the @xmath0 was also suggested in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 is , however , widely believed to be part of a p - wave nonet of @xmath4 states @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite support the suggestion of @xcite for the @xmath0 as a @xmath2 molecule , but surprisingly also show that for spin s=2 the @xmath2 interaction is attractive and about three times larger than in the case of s=0 , thanks to which a stronger bound @xmath2 state appears for s=2 , which was identified in @xcite as the @xmath1 resonance .",
    "the experimental situation is rich in the case of the @xmath1 , which has a very pronounced peak in @xmath3 scattering going to pions .",
    "compatible results are found in different laboratories and using different methods , crystal ball @xcite , mark ii @xcite , jade @xcite , topaz @xcite , md-1 @xcite , cello @xcite and venus @xcite .",
    "the pdg quotes the result @xmath8 kev @xcite .",
    "recent results are also presented by the belle collaboration in @xcite and in @xcite , where the preferred solution gives @xmath9 kev .",
    "the situation of the @xmath10 decay of the @xmath0 is rather unclear .",
    "the latest edition of the pdg @xcite does not quote any value , superseding old results which were ambiguous .",
    "the belle collaboration has the most recent results in this direction  @xcite .",
    "this work quotes a central value for the mass of the @xmath0 of 1470 mev , but with very large uncertainties , of the order of 255 mev , mostly of systematic origin .",
    "it also quotes a value for the radiative decay of this resonance , again with a very large uncertainty , @xmath11=(@xmath12 ) ev .",
    "the same work quotes more accurate values deduced by the crystal ball collaboration  @xcite , @xmath11=(@xmath13 ) ev , with , however , much less statistics than belle .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "an evaluation of the radiative decay into @xmath14 of the @xmath0 has been done in @xcite , where using a model where the scalars are a mixture of @xmath4 and @xmath15 the authors find a small value between @xmath16 kev .",
    "much bigger values , of the order of @xmath17  kev are obtained in @xcite assuming the state to be basically a @xmath4 of non strange nature , although actually the value quoted is used as input to determine parameters of the theory",
    ". ratios of radiative widths between scalar states are also quoted in @xcite under the assumption that they are @xmath4 states mixing with glueballs .",
    "results for the @xmath3 decay of the @xmath1 state are also obtained in @xcite , where assuming that the resonance is a @xmath4 state , a satisfactory description of this decay rate together with that of the @xmath18 is obtained at the expense of fitting two free parameters .",
    "the novel picture of @xcite puts the @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances on the same footing , allowing one to calculate the @xmath3 radiative width within the same formalism .",
    "this is the aim of the present paper .",
    "the evaluation presented here turns out to be rather simple technically , once the formalism for the generation of the two resonances is developed in @xcite .",
    "we will find that the widths obtained are rather precise , with respect to uncertainties from the parameters of the model , and agree well with the well known experimental results for the case of the @xmath1 , while the one for the @xmath0 follows the actual experimental trend that it is indeed about one order of magnitude smaller than that for the @xmath1 state .",
    "in @xcite the driving term for the @xmath19 interaction was obtained from the hidden gauge lagrangian @xmath20 where the symbol @xmath21 @xmath22 stands for the @xmath23 trace and @xmath24 is given by @xmath25~~,\\ ] ] with @xmath26 , and @xmath27 mev is the pion decay constant .",

    "in addition , intermediate @xmath40 states , driven by pion exchange through anomalous @xmath41 couplings , were also taken into account .",
    "it was found there that the real parts of the @xmath39 and @xmath40 intermediate states mechanisms were individually small compared to the dominant tree level @xmath42 mechanisms and in addition there were cancellations between the @xmath39 and @xmath40 contributions , rendering the tree level @xmath19 terms largely dominant .",

    "@xcite uses a full relativistic treatment of the loop functions , which guarantees exact unitarity and analiticity of the amplitudes .",

    "@xcite ( see pag 4 of this reference ) , particularly because a small fine tuning of the parameters is allowed in the approach to fit one resonance mass , which allows one to cope with small correcions stemming from different sources .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] shows results including also the box diagram accounting for @xmath39 decay , which plays a minor role in the binding of the two states but enlarges the width of the states due to the large phase space available for decay into two pions .",

    "the agreement is very good , but one is left to think why more accurate results are claimed in the crystal ball work than in @xcite in spite of having much less statistics .",

    "admitting that the qcd dynamics is richer than the one provided by the hidden gauge mechanism used in the present approach , the hopes are that the model resulting from the present framework can be a good approximation to the real dynamics of the interaction of vector mesons in a certain energy regime where we move .",
    "how good this approximation is can only be found by testing the model with experimental data .",

    "other tests would be most welcome to gradually find support for the idea of these two resonances as being , largely , dynamically generated states from the @xmath19 interaction , or @xmath19 bound states in the present case .",
    "certainly , precise measurement of the decay rate for the @xmath0 state , together with simultaneous results for both resonances in other models would be most helpful to further advance in our knowledge of the nature of these resonances .",

    "we extended the formalism to account for the radiative decay of the resonances into @xmath3 .",
    "the extension has been done following the standard method to deal with dynamically generated resonances , in which the photons are coupled to the components of the resonance , in this case @xmath2 .",
    "this is technically implemented by means of loop functions which involve the photon couplings to the components of the resonance . in the present case ,",
    "the peculiarity of the hidden gauge approach , in which the photons couple directly to one @xmath62 , allows a factorization of the strong part of the interaction and the final result is converted into a tree level contribution , hence rid of any ambiguity due to possible divergences of the loops .",
    "the results obtained for the radiative width of the @xmath1 are in perfect agreement with experimental data .",
    "so are those for the @xmath0 when they are compared with the experimental results of the crystal ball collaboration , or those of the more recent experiment by belle within its large errors .",
    "yet , the large systematic errors quoted in the work from belle , that has much better statistics , should raise some caution on these experimental numbers . with the ultimate goal of learning about the nature of the two resonances discussed , and having in mind the picture",
    "as dynamically generated states emerging from the @xmath2 interaction in the local hidden gauge approach , the test passed here in the radiative decay is a first step in the search of support for this idea , and further tests should be most welcome .",
    "to further strengthen this idea it would be most useful to have good results for the radiative decay width of the @xmath0 state , as well as results from other theoretical models for both resonances which could tell us how stringent is the test of this radiative decay to discriminate among different models . the work presented here should stimulate research along these lines .",

    "<S> using recent results obtained within the hidden gauge formalism for vector mesons , in which the @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances are dynamically generated resonances from the @xmath2 interaction , we evaluate the radiative decay of these resonances into @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain results for the width in good agreement with the experimental data for the @xmath1 state and a width about a factor two smaller for the @xmath0 resonance , which is also in agreement with the data of the crystal ball collaboration and with the more recent ones from the belle collaboration , which however have a very large uncertainty . </S>"
