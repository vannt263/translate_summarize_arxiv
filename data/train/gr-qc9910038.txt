    "there is a growing interest in new classes of objects : soft - gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) . until now ,",
    "four identified sgrs are reported observationally .",
    "their associations with supernova remnants strongly suggest that the sgrs are young neutron stars ( see e.g. kulkarni & frail @xcite ; murakami et al .",
    "furthermore , recent measurements ( see e.g. kouveliotou et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) of the period and period derivative yield evidence for these pulsars to be ultramagnetized neutron stars with field strength ( @xmath0 ) in excess of @xmath1 , i.e. , _ magnetars _",
    "( duncan & thompson @xcite ; thompson & duncan @xcite ) .",
    "some class of x - ray pulsars also suggests the magnetic fields with @xmath2@xmath3 ( see e.g. mereghetti & stella @xcite ) .",
    "such magnetic fields are much stronger than that of known pulsars ( @xmath4@xmath5 ; see e.g. taylor et al .",
    "@xcite ) until then . though the relation between the sgrs and the axps is not yet clear , there",
    "exist neutron stars with very strong magnetic fields . in these ultramagnetized stars ,",
    "the magnetic influence becomes important as well as the relativistic effects .",
    "if we assume that a long - lived electric current flows in highly conductive neutron - star matter , the magnetic pressure corresponding to the lorentz force comes into play .",
    "hence , it induces deformation of stars . in this paper , we study such deformation from spherical stars within a general relativistic framework .",
    "the quadrupole deformation of magnetized newtonian stars was discussed by chandrasekhar & fermi ( @xcite ) and ferraro ( @xcite ) , in which incompressible fluid body with a dipole magnetic field is assumed .",
    "this deformation has been discussed also in relation to the gravitational radiation ( galtsov et al .",
    "@xcite ; galtsov & tsetkov @xcite ) . the general relativistic approach by bocquet et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and bonazzola & gourgoulhon ( @xcite ) has appeared recently .",
    "however , their approach is fully numerical . in this paper",
    ", we develop almost an analytical treatment by assuming weak magnetic fields compared with gravity .",
    "this assumption is valid even in the magnetars .",
    "our formulation is regarded as a general relativistic version of chandrasekhar & fermi ( @xcite ) and ferraro ( @xcite ) . in our method",
    ", we can easily include realistic equations of state ( eos ) and construct relativistic magnetized stars .",
    "furthermore , this method gives simple calculations of ellipticity of deformed stars , and so on .",
    "since the observed ultramagnetized neutron stars have long periods ( @xmath6 ) , we may neglect the rotation of the magnetized stars , that is , we discuss static cases .",
    "we take non - rotating , spherical relativistic stars as backgrounds , and consider the magnetic fields as the perturbation . in particular , we consider only axisymmetric , poloidal magnetic fields produced by long - lived ( toroidal ) electric currents , because toroidal magnetic fields would break the symmetric property ( see also bocquet et al .",
    "@xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume a perfectly conducting interior . since we now consider non - rotating configurations , this implies that the electric field inside the stars must be zero .",
    "hence , there is no electric charge inside the stars . from this , we can write the 4-current as @xmath7 ( bocquet et al .  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the surface charge should be absent , since the total charge should vanish in astrophysical situations .",
    "otherwise , the electromagnetic field itself would have the angular momentum due to the non - vanishing electric field produced by the charge ( feynman et al .",
    "@xcite ; ma @xcite ; de castro @xcite ) .",
    "this is not the purely static case .",
    "the current distribution is introduced as the first - order quantity with respect to the perturbation .",
    "the corresponding magnetic field is solved by the maxwell equation .",
    "we shall investigate deformation of stars due to the resultant magnetic stress , which arises as the second - order correction to the background field .",
    "this perturbation method is very similar to that of slowly rotating stars developed by hartle ( @xcite ) , in which the rotation is regarded as a small parameter .",
    "our formalism can be applied to any configurations of the magnetic fields . however , we restrict ourselves to dipole magnetic fields because the dipole fields are important in many astrophysical situations .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sect .  2 ,",
    "the magnetic fields are investigated in the background space - time .",
    "the effect arising from the magnetic stress on equilibrium of stars is considered in sect .",
    "the solution corresponding to the quadrupole deformation of the stars will be given .",
    "to evaluate the deformation quantitatively , the ellipticity is discussed in sect .",
    "4 . finally ,",
    "5 is devoted to the discussion . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the units in which @xmath8 , and the gaussian system of units for electromagnetic fields .",
    "we now consider an axisymmetric , poloidal magnetic field created by a 4-current @xmath9 in a non - rotating , spherical star .",
    "we suppose that the magnetic field is weak , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "the line element of the spherically symmetric space - time is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath14 only .",
    "since we do not consider electric fields , we can assume that the electromagnetic 4-potential @xmath15 has only the @xmath16-component , i.e. , @xmath17 ( see also bocquet et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in this case , the maxwell equation is reduced to @xmath18 where the prime denotes the differentiation with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "we expand the potential @xmath19 and the current @xmath20 as follows ( regge & wheeler @xcite ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the legendre s polynomial of degree @xmath23 . substituting these forms into eq .",
    "( [ la ] ) , we have @xmath24 for a given current @xmath25 , we can obtain the potential @xmath26 and , therefore , the magnetic field . from now on ,",
    "we only consider a dipole magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath27 . the potential outside the star is easily solved ( ginzburg & ozerno @xcite ; petterson @xcite ; wasserman & shapiro @xcite ) in the form @xmath28 , \\ ] ] where @xmath29 is a constant corresponding to the magnetic dipole moment with respect to an observer at infinity , and @xmath30 is the total mass of the background star . in order to describe the magnetic field inside the star ,",
    "we require the current distribution @xmath31 .",
    "the current @xmath31 is not arbitrary but subject to an integrability condition ( ferraro @xcite ; chandrasekhar & prendergast @xcite ; bonazzola et al .",
    "@xcite ) . as will be shown in eq .",

    ", we can construct the magnetic field in the whole space - time .",

    "[ mgfield - bth ] displays the tetrad component @xmath42 on the equatorial plane ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath14 .",
    "we have normalized them by the typical magnetic field strength @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the radius of the star .",
    "the solid lines denote a relativistic case , whereas the dashed lines correspond to a newtonian case . in these calculations ,",
    "we have used the polytropic eos : @xmath46 . from these figures , we see that the intensity of the magnetic field increases as @xmath14 becomes closer to the center . furthermore , these two figures show that despite the same magnetic moment with respect to an observer at infinity , the central magnetic field of the relativistic star is stronger than that of the newtonian star by about 50% of the newtonian case .",
    "therefore , it follows that the relativistic effect strengthens the internal magnetic fields .",
    "next , we consider deformation of magnetized stars due to the magnetic stress , which is regarded as the second - order effect .",
    "we formulate the deformation of the star and space - time , following hartle ( @xcite ) .",

    "we turn our attention to the interior solution . for a given eos",

    "for the actual numerical work , we investigate the behavior of the metric functions in the vicinity of the center .",
    "first , we consider the metric functions @xmath50 and @xmath104 . the solution in which both @xmath50 and @xmath104 vanish at the center ( see also chandrasekhar & miller @xcite ) is given by @xmath105 where @xmath39 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ a_ext ] ) .",

    "the regular solution at the center is @xmath107 where constants @xmath108 and @xmath109 are not independent by the regularity condition at the center .",
    "finally , we can obtain the metric functions by imposing the junction conditions ( obrien & synge @xcite ) at the surface : @xmath110 where @xmath111 denotes the metric components . from these conditions ,",
    "the integration constants @xmath89 , @xmath94 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are fixed .",
    "we consider the magnetic field on the stellar shape of the equilibrium .",
    "the additional lorentz force @xmath112 mainly acts on it in the perpendicular direction to the symmetry axis ( @xmath43 ) , that is , flattens the star .",
    "the flattening effect is also recognized by considering the @xmath113 component of the magnetic stress tensor , @xmath114 along the symmetry axis , @xmath115 must vanish owing to the axisymmetry .",
    "hence , the stress @xmath116 is negative on this axis . on the other hand , on the equatorial plane , since @xmath117 is zero at any @xmath14 , the stress @xmath116 has the opposite sign .",
    "this indicates that the spherical star is shrunk in the parallel direction to the symmetry axis ( @xmath118 ) and expanded in the perpendicular direction ( @xmath43 ) by the magnetic effect .",
    "thus we can see the flattening effect .",
    "next , in order to evaluate the deformation quantitatively , let us introduce the ellipticity , which is defined as @xmath119 where these radii denote the circumferential radii under general relativistic situations . from this definition , ellipticity is given by ( chandrasekhar & miller @xcite ) @xmath120 the first term of the right - hand side in eq .",
    "( [ elp ] ) corresponds to , in a sense , the effect of the ` lorentz force ' , the second term represents the effect of the perturbation of the ` gravitational potential ' induced by the magnetic effect , and the third term is a ` purely relativistic term ' which arises from a definition of the radius , that is , the circumferential radius .",
    "these contributions to the ellipticity are shown in fig .",
    "[ elp - t ] as a function of the relativistic factor @xmath121 .",
    "we have normalized them by @xmath122 ( @xmath123 is the moment of inertia , which is well defined also in the relativistic case ) , and we have used a polytropic eos ( @xmath124 ) . from this figure , we can see that the term due to the ` gravitational potential ' does not change significantly , while the term concerning the ` lorentz force ' increases with the relativistic factor @xmath121 as known from figs .",
    "[ mgfield - br ] and [ mgfield - bth ] .",
    "[ elp - mr ] displays the ( total ) ellipticity for different polytropic models ( @xmath125 and @xmath126 ) . from this figure",
    ", we find that the ellipticity becomes large as the relativistic factor @xmath121 increases , in each case of @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the common feature of the monotonic increase shows the effect of the ` lorentz force term ' to be effective .",
    "an important thing is that the relativistic calculation leads to much larger ellipticity for a fixed value of @xmath127 .",
    "finally , we give a comment concerning the previous general - relativistic studies . the quantity plotted in fig .",
    "[ elp - mr ] is exactly the _ magnetic distortion factor _ @xmath128 introduced by bonazzola & gourgoulhon ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is noticed that although the eos which we have used is different from that of bonazzola & gourgoulhon ( @xcite ) , both calculations give the same results ( see fig .  2 of their paper ) ,",
    "that is , @xmath128 takes the values very close to @xmath129 .",
    "recent observations suggest that some class of neutron stars has strong magnetic fields .",
    "these may promote a new branch with magnetized stars . as a simple approach to the models",
    ", we have formulated the structure of the magnetized stars within a general relativistic framework , considering the perturbation from a spherical star . in particular ,",
    "a dipole magnetic field has been dealt with .",
    "we have showed the current distribution which yields equilibrium configurations up to the second order in @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , the ellipticity of the star has been estimated as a simple example .",
    "we have found that the ellipticity becomes large as the relativistic factor @xmath121 increases , for the same energy ratio of the magnetic energy to the gravitational energy .",
    "our analytical approach have made the calculations much simpler than that of the previous work .",
    "this method can be extended to more general cases of realistic eos and general current distribution , in which the current exists in some domain of the star .",
    "therefore , this can be applied to wider range of astrophysical situations .",
    "another extension of this work is to incorporate rotation of stars .",
    "the stationary configurations , in which the rotation axis is aligned with the magnetic axis , make the calculations complex because of appearance of non - vanishing electric fields . however , this can be managed . since the rotational effect deforms the star as well as the magnetic effect , we are also interested in seeing which of them to be effective",
