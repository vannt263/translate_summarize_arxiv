    "regular self - assembled adatom structures , ranging from superlattices via nanodot arrays to strain relief pattern are interesting for various general and technological reasons , reviews were given in [ 1,2 ] . while interactions of adatoms comprise various mechanisms [ 3 ] the focus on elastic interactions in this paper is driven by the question on their importance compared with other interactions .",
    "in recent calculations on the stability and dynamics of strain mediated superlattices it was shown that the role of elastic interactions was underestimated compared with surface state mediated interactions [ 4 ] , so other surface phenomena seem worth to be discussed in the light of strain mediated interactions .",
    "anisotropies of adatom pattern can act as a probe for indicating strain mediated interactions via correlation to anisotropies of the substrate elastic constants .",
    "the calculations on the stability and dynamics of strain mediated superlattices [ 4 ] covered a low coverage region and left the question open how adatoms arrange under equilibrium conditions when the coverage is increased .",
    "the experiments of plass et al . on domain patterns [ 5 ]",
    "provide a challenge to prove the ability of an elastic continuum theory in building a bridge between superlattices and stress relief patterns .",
    "such bridge was built before with a green function method for the non - equilibrium case [ 6 ] .",
    "the focus on cu@xmath0111@xmath1 has good reasons as well : cu is among the substrates with the highest elastic anisotropies and cu@xmath0111@xmath1 seems to be a preferred surface for experiments .",
    "unfortunately the crystal directions are often not published , so a solid proof of elastic effects is hindered .",
    "the predictions of this work are intended to allow a verification of the theory by experiments .",
    "the model used in this work to simulate adatom morphologies is an adaptation of the one used in [ 4 ] .",
    "the latter used a grid - less molecular dynamic algorithm suited for low coverages .",
    "for the higher coverages up to 1 ml and the @xmath0111@xmath1 surface discussed in this work it had to be converted to a grid base where adatom positions reside on a triangular lattice representing identical threefold coordinated substrate sites .",
    "the interaction mechanism has been kept ; it is based on the isotropic stress individual adatoms on threefold coordinated sites exert to their neighborhood .",
    "the limitations of such interaction mechanisms and of other model assumptions are discussed below .",
    "the model results will be presented as sample adatom configurations for increasing coverages and for three variants of the interaction .",
    "the variants stand for three different strengths of short range interactions and should give an idea of the interplay between short- and medium - term interactions .",
    "the model results will also be presented as pair distributions derived from averaging over sample configurations .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section 2 the details of the interaction model are recalled and the simulation model is detailed . furthermore the calculation method for pair distributions is described . in section 3",
    "the model results will be presented as sample adatom configurations and as pair distributions derived from averaging over sample configurations . for symmetry reasons the pair distributions will cover 30@xmath2 segments only . in section 4",

    "section 5 closes with a summary of the results .",

    "+ the assumption of a perfectly flat surface excludes the effects of steps , known for their active role in nucleation and growth , partly due to strain in their neighborhood . +",

    "the adatom configurations with interaction @xmath57 at @xmath43=0.045 resulting from an off - grid algorithm in [ 4 ] could be repeated with an on - grid algorithm .",
    "both results and the derived pair distributions are consistent with the solution of a born - green - ivon type integral equation describing the adatom pair distribution from statistical mechanics principles [ 7 ] .",

    "this is explained by minimization of the total configuration energy by forming adatom clusters or stripes or vacancies around 5 lattice distances apart .",
    "substrate strain generated by adatoms stressing the surface is allowed to release within the unpopulated sites .",

    "the trends when increasing the short range attraction are + - larger clusters + - triangular instead of linear clusters ( reflected by an increasing next neighbor pair distribution ) + - more connected clusters + - less influence of the substrate on the superlattice and stripe directions , i.e. more isotropic configurations + - slightly increased feature size .",
    "strain mediated superlattices on cu@xmath0111@xmath1 in the coverage region up to @xmath43=0.045 ml were already discussed and compared with experiments [ 10,11 ] in [ 4 ] .",
    "the agreement was good enough to propose strain mediated interactions as an alternative to the one discussed in [ 10,11 ] .",
    "the current investigation was triggered by an unknown referee of [ 4 ] .",
    "he raised the point how other manifestations of elastic interactions on surfaces , especially stress domains [ 12 ] , are related to adatom superstructures .",
    "stress domains are ordered patterns of less dense and more dense adatom areas , for example adatom gas areas and monolayer areas forming spontaneously .",
    "they minimize surface energy by balancing short - range attractive with long - range repulsive interaction .",
    "substrate strain created by surface stress in the more dense areas is allowed to relax in the less dense areas .",
    "the domains reflect the elastic anisotropy of the substrate .",
    "observations at the pb / cu@xmath0111@xmath1 system [ 5 ] can be characterized by + - ordered but mobile circular droplets ( containing thousands of adatoms ) at low coverages + - stripes at medium coverage with a long range order improving when reducing temperature + - ordered inverse droplets at high coverages approaching a monolayer ( as predicted earlier , see references in [ 5 ] ) .",
    "+ the periodicity of patterns is in the 100 nm range , decreasing with increasing temperature .",
    "the observed temperature range is 623 k to 673 k. the order of droplets can - from a first glance - be interpreted as a superlattice type .",
    "the sequence of island superlattices , domain patterns and inverse droplets on pb / cu@xmath0111@xmath1 with increasing coverage observed in [ 5 ] would serve as a striking experimental evidence of the theory and the simulation results presented in section 3.4 if the length scales and the temperature would be the same .",
    "unfortunately [ 5 ] describes a high temperature experiment with adatom clusters of thousands of adatoms while the experiments showing superlattice effects on a few lattice constant scale have been performed in the 10k region [ 10,11 ] .",
    "so the question arises if the present molecular dynamics simulation could be extended to handle clusters and structures of hundreds or thousands of adatoms",
    ". unfortunately this would be far beyond the resources of a pc , so we must rely on scaling arguments to argue the same driver - elastic interactions - for both phenomena , adatom superlattices and stress domain patterns :    following the cluster section of [ 8 ] we argue a simple superposition ansatz for the elastic interactions : two clusters of @xmath78 and @xmath79 adatoms create @xmath78*@xmath79 times the elastic inter cluster energy of two single adatoms .",
    "this ansatz , of course , is a strong restriction not considering e.g. short range adatom - adatom interactions and lattice mismatch effects .",
    "two n=@xmath80 clusters would create an interaction @xmath81 @xmath82 times @xmath28 .",
    "the temperature range for the stress domain experiments at 650 k is a factor@xmath83 higher than the regime of single adatom effects , so the scaled cluster interaction @xmath84=@xmath81/@xmath85 t would be @xmath86 times higher . the typical length according to eq .",

    "the coverage @xmath89 would be reduced by a factor of about 464 ( noting that the coverage of adatoms and of clusters have different meaning ) .",
    "we summarize that length scales may differ from 5 substrate lattice constants to 100 lattice constants in the example above , but the elastic interaction mechanism is the same .",
    "it would be a big surprise if such simple scaling arguments could explain the physics of stress domains more than qualitatively .",
    "in fact the measurement in [ 15 ] shows a decrease in domain feature size from 140 nm to 40 nm when the temperature rises from 590 k to 650 k , far beyond the above scaling effects .",
    "the authors explain such decrease in stripe periodicity with the change in domain - boundary free energy caused by thermally broken pb - pb bonds .",
    "thus the effects of short range interactions override the effects of elastic medium range interactions under certain conditions .",
    "this is not in contradiction to the scaling arguments above since eq .",
    "( 2.9 ) is valid only for a type interaction which does not include short range effects .",
    "the influence of substrate anisotropy as observed in [ 13 ] is reflected in the present simulations and the pair distributions derived . the dominating stripe orientation at coverage @xmath43=0.5 ml reported is @xmath0 - 1 - 12@xmath1",
    ", the model results show a weak stripe orientation in the same directions . .",
    "the assumed equilibrium conditions are confirmed by experiments with reversible shape transitions ( droplet to elongated islands with dog - bone - like shapes ) during heating cycles [ 14 ] .",
    "an increase in temperature changes the shapes the same way as an increasing coverage does , again in line width the scaling arguments outlined above ( same shape of if reduced or @xmath43 increased ) .",
    "both experimental results can be seen as a hint for the validity of the assumptions and conclusions .",
    "the lack of details reported makes the comparison of further experiments with the present model similarly difficult .",
    "two further examples should show its ability and its limitations :    n on cu@xmath0111@xmath1 forms elongated islands , stable at room temperature , aligned in 3 equivalent crystal directions .",
    "the islands show a characteristic distance of about 10 nm and are often colliding [ 16 ] . since coverage and crystal directions are not reported , a comparison with stripes as calculated from the model is incomplete , but similarities with figs .",
    "3.e , 4.e , 5.e should encourage further research .",

    "they are different from the ones found in this calculations due to their tendency of bi - layer growth even at moderate coverages .",
    "triangular bi - layer islands show lateral displacements of the co - co bond lengths ( measured by the surface state electron energy ) dependent on their positions within the islands , associated with lateral strain .",
    "the following picture for strain mediated morphologies is concluded : + stripe morphologies correlate with repulsive short range interaction while attractive short range interactions destabilize stripes and - via multilayer growth - lead to islands .",
    "islands create strain and interact via strain and their shape minimizes elastic energy .",
    "clusters arranged in superlattices and stress domain patterns on cu@xmath0111@xmath1 in the temperature range of about 10k with a characteristic length of about 5 to 6 lattice constants hopefully may be found in existing material .",
    "more experimental material is needed to determine size and nature of short range interactions and also the orientation of cluster/ stripe structures relative to the substrate crystal directions .",
    "first principles methods ( like density - functional - theory ) need to be applied for estimating the stress parameters .",
    "a further question is how the theory successfully describing mesoscopic stress patterns [ 12 ] can be utilized to better understand the microscopic effects discussed in the present analysis : when domain boundary effects play an important role in the mesoscopic range , the effects of short range interactions in the microscopic range should be similarly significant .",
    "the morphology of adatoms on other surfaces is an equally interesting topic , the much stronger effects of elastic anisotropy on @xmath0001@xmath1 surfaces of many materials is expected to lead to further insight .",
    "increasing the accuracy of the simulation by increasing the diameter of the simulation area on much more powerful computers may also lead to additional insights .",
    "bi - layer effects would extend the scope of the model but require some basic work .",
    "it should be noted that long range magnetic interactions should also be considered in the co case .",
    "the restrictions of the present isotropic stress model motivated an extension of the model [ 19 ] : dimers are supposed to create anisotropic stress by stretching their bond . such stress creates other types of elastic interactions including lattice mismatch .",
    "substrate strain mediated adatom configurations have been simulated for cu@xmath1111@xmath1 surfaces for three short range interaction types .",
    "the adatom coverages range up to nearly a monolayer .",
    "pair distributions have been derived to prove morphologies from superlattices of single adatoms and clusters to ordered stress domain patterns .",
    "higher coverages beyond 0.5 monolayers show vacancy structures just inverted .",
    "the short range interaction shows a significant influence on the cluster size within the superlattices .",
    "substrate elastic anisotropy influences the superlattice orientation with respect to the substrate crystal directions .",
    "experiments showing similar structures have been compared with the model . for low temperatures superlattices of single adatoms",
    "have been found while for increased temperatures ordered islands and stripes of adatoms have been reported .",
    "there is some evidence of elastic interactions being the common cause but a final conclusion on the validity of the theory remains open at this point in time .",
    "in the course of recent calculations a code fault affecting previous results [ 4,7 ] was detected : the @xmath56 term in eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) was omitted in the code there .",
    "therefore the p=6 interaction terms on @xmath0111@xmath1 surfaces had a sign error .",
    "as a consequence the results have to be rotated by 30@xmath2 . in the current version of this paper",
    "the fault has been corrected .",
