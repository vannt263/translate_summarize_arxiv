    "the story of relic gravitational waves has revealed the character of ya .",
    "b.  zeldovich not only as a great scientist but also as a great personality .",
    "one should remember that the beginning of the 1970 s was dominated by the belief that massless particles , such as photons , neutrinos , gravitons , can not be created by the gravitational field of a homogeneous isotropic universe .",
    "zeldovich shared this view and was publishing papers supporting this picture .",
    "he was enthusiastic about cosmological particle creation @xcite and contributed a lot ( together with coauthors ) to this subject .",
    "however , he thought that something interesting and important could only happen if the early universe was highly anisotropic .",
    "when i showed @xcite that massless gravitons ( gravitational waves ) could , in fact , be created by the gravitational field of a homogeneous isotropic universe , a considerable debate arose around this work .",
    "i argued that the coupling of gravitons to the ` external ' gravitational field follows unambiguously from the equations of general relativity , and it differs from the coupling of other known massless particles to gravity .",
    "in contrast to other massless fields , this specific coupling of gravitational waves allows their superadiabatic ( parametric ) amplification by the ` pumping ' gravitational field of a nonstationary universe .",
    "( a similar coupling to gravity can be postulated for the still hypothetical massless scalar field . )",
    "if classical gravitational waves were present before the era of amplification , they would have been amplified .",
    "but their presense is not of necessity : even if the waves are initially in their quantum - mechanical vacuum ( ground ) state , the state will inevitably evolve into a multi - particle state .",
    "in phenomenological language , gravitational waves are being generated from their zero - point quantum oscillations .",
    "the intense debate has finished in a surprising and very flattering way for me .",
    "it is common knowledge that it was virtually impossible to win a scientific bet against zeldovich - he knew practically everything about physics and had tremendous physical intuition .",
    "but sometimes he would find a cute way of admitting that his previous thinking was not quite right , and that he also learned something from a debate . on this occasion it happened in the following manner .",
    "after one of his rare trips to eastern europe ( as far as i remember , it was poland ) ya.b",
    ". gave me a gift .",
    "this was a poster showing a sophisticated , impressionist - style , lady .",
    "the fact that this was a poster with a sophisticated lady was not really surprising - you could expect this from yakov borisovich . what was surprising and flattering for me was his hand - written note at the bottom of the poster .",
    "in my translation from the russian , it said  thank you for your goal in my net \" .",
    "ya.b . was hinting at my passion for football , and he knew that this comparison would be appreciated much better than any other .",
    "so , this is how a great man admits a clarification of an error ; he simply says  thank you for your goal in my net \" .",
    "it was clear from the very beginning of the study of relic gravitational waves that the result of amplification of a wave - field should depend on the strength and time evolution of the gravitational pump field .",
    "we know little about the very early universe these days , even less was known at the beginning of the 70 s .",
    "the best thing you can do is to conider plausible models .",
    "the simplest option is to assume @xcite that the cosmological scale factor @xmath0 in the expression @xmath1\\ ] ] consists of pieces of power - law evolution : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are constants .",
    "then , the perturbed einstein equations for @xmath5 simplify and can be solved in elementary functions . in particular , the intervals of power - law evolution ( [ a ] ) make tractable the effective ` potential barrier ' @xmath6 in the gravitational wave ( g.w . ) equation @xcite : @xmath7 = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 .    using eq.([a ] ) and the unperturbed einstein equations one can also find the effective equation of state for the ` matter ' , whatever it is , which drives the intervals of @xmath0 : @xmath9    the somewhat strange form of the index @xmath10 in eq.([a ] ) was motivated by a serious concern of that time - it was necessary to prove that even a small deviation from the exceptional law of evolution @xmath11 guarantees the effect of g.w .",
    "it is only in this exceptional case that the effective potential @xmath6 vanishes , and therefore the superadiabatic coupling of gravitational waves to the nonstationary pump field @xmath0 also vanishes .",
    "( the analogous effective potential is absent in equations for photons , massless neutrinos , and some massless scalar particles . )",
    "the convenience of the notation utilized in eq.([a ] ) is that it parameterises the exceptional case by @xmath12 and deviations from this case by a small @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , it was shown @xcite that the amplitude of the generated g.w .",
    "mode is proportional to small @xmath4 ; but it is not zero if @xmath13 . at the same time , if @xmath4 is not especially small , the amplitude of the gravitational wave @xmath14 , soon after the beginning of the superadibatic regime and while the wave is still in this regime , i.e. before any further processing of the amplitude , evaluates to @xmath15    estimate ( [ hb ] ) is approximate ( we will be discussing more accurate formulas below ) but it contains all the necessary physics .",
    "the underlying concepts of generation and detection of primordial gravitational waves have not changed since the first calculations @xcite , and it is important for our further discussion to recall them again .    to begin with , we note that eq.([hb ] ) is formulated for the dimensionless amplitude @xmath16 of a given g.w .",
    "mode characterised by a constant dimensionless wavenumber @xmath17 .",
    "( the @xmath18 and @xmath19 mode - functions are related by @xmath20 . )",
    "the wavelength @xmath21 , measured in units of laboratory standards ( as zeldovich used to say , measured in centimeters ) , is related to @xmath17 by @xmath22 .",
    "it is convenient to use ( and we will always do this ) such an @xmath23-parameterisation of @xmath0 that the present - day scale factor is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the present - day value of the hubble radius .",
    "then , @xmath26 is the wavenumber of the waves whose wavelength today is equal the prsent - day hubble radius .",
    "longer waves have smaller @xmath17 s , and shorter waves have larger @xmath17 s .    expression ( [ hb ] ) is essentially a consequence of the following two assumptions .",
    "first , it is assumed that the mode under consideration has entered the superadibatic regime in the past , and is still in this regime .",
    "this means that the mode s frequency , instead of being much larger than the characteristic frequency of the pump field , became comparable with it at some time in the past . or , in cosmological context , the wavelength @xmath27 of the mode @xmath17 , instead of being much shorter than the instanteneous hubble radius @xmath28 , became equal to it at some moment of time @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30 . for the scale factors of eq.([a ] ) , this condition leads to @xmath31 .",
    "second , we assume that by the beginning of the superadiabatic regime at @xmath32 , the mode has still been in its vacuum state , rather than , say , in a strongly excited ( multi - particle ) state .",
    "that is , in the language of classical physics , the mode s amplitude near @xmath29 was not much larger than @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the planck length , @xmath35 .",
    "this condition on the amplitude follows from the requirement that initially there were only the zero - point quantum oscillations of the g.w .",
    "field , and the initial energy of the mode was @xmath36 . because of the condition @xmath30 , we can also write @xmath37 as @xmath38 .",
    "the amplitude of the mode , after the mode s entrance to the amplifying superadiabatic regime , and as long as this regime lasts , remains at the constant level @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath39 .",
    "this holds true instead of the adiabatic decrease of the amplitude @xmath40 that would be true in the adiabatic regime . in general , the quantity @xmath41 is different for different @xmath17 s : @xmath42 therefore , a specific dependence on @xmath17 arises in the function @xmath37 , and this is how one arrives at eq.([hb ] ) in a simple qualitative manner .",
    "formula ( [ hb ] ) gives the evaluation of the primordial ( before further processing ) g.w .",
    "spectrum @xmath14 . roughly speaking , the initial vacuum spectrum",
    "@xmath43 has been transformed into the primordial spectrum @xmath44 , where @xmath45 characterizes the scale factor of the era when the transition from the adiabatic to superadiabatic regime has taken place for the given interval of wavenumbers @xmath17 .",
    "however , the same mode @xmath17 can sooner or later leave the amplifying regime and start oscillating again .",
    "obviously , this reverse transition from superadiabatic to adiabatic regime is being described by the same theory .    the final amplitudes at some fixed moment of time ( for example , today s amplitudes ) @xmath46",
    "are related to the @xmath14-amplitudes by @xmath47 where @xmath48 characterizes the era when the opposite transition from the superadiabatic to adiabatic regime has taken place ( this is why the minus sign arises in front of @xmath49 in the exponent ) .",
    "the discussed amplitudes @xmath50 are in fact the root - mean - square ( @xmath51 ) amplitudes of the multi - mode field , they determine the mean - square value of the wave field @xmath16 according to the general formula @xmath52    it is necessary to say that in the beginning of the 80 s , the inflationary cosmological scenario governed by a scalar field @xcite was gaining popularity . its central element is the interval of desitter expansion , which corresponds to @xmath53 in eq.([a ] ) ( @xmath23 grows from @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 in eq.([w ] ) . by the time of publication of the inflationary scenario , unusual equations of state for ` matter ' driving the very early universe , including such exotic ones as @xmath57 , had already been the subject of cosmological research , most notably in the work of a. d. sakharov @xcite .    the g.w .",
    "calculations for the special case @xmath53 were performed in a number of papers ( see for example @xcite ) . if @xmath53 , the dependence on @xmath17 vanishes in the general eq.([hb ] ) , and the primodial ( unprocessed ) spectrum @xmath14 becomes ` flat '  that is , @xmath17-independent .",
    "ironically , the prospects of direct detection of the stochastic g.w .",
    "background characterised by the corresponding processed ( today s ) spectrum had already been explored by that time @xcite ; the processed spectral index for this model is @xmath58 in notations of that paper .",
    "ref.@xcite also suggested the use of cross - correlated data from two detectors and touched upon the technique of ` drag - free satellites ' that was later developed in the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) .",
    "the generality of inflationary , quasi - desitter , solutions was a serious concern for zeldovich during long time .",
    "he kept wondering about the sensitivity of inflationary solutions to the choice of initial conditions .",
    "nobody would take the inflationary scenario seriously if it were a very contrived or unstable solution .",
    "however , it was shown @xcite that the inflationary - type evolutions are , in fact , attractors in the space of all possible solutions of the corresponding dynamical system . this decisive property made inflationary evolutions more plausible and appealing .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath59 expected today is depicted in fig.1 ( for more details , see @xcite ) . almost everything in this graph",
    "is the result of the processing of the primordial spectrum during the matter - dominated and radiation - dominated stages .",
    "the postulated ` zeldovich s epoch ' governed by a very stiff effective equation of state , is also present in the graph , as shown by some relative increase of power at very high frequencies .",
    "the primordial part of the spectrum survives only at frequencies below the present - day hubble frequency @xmath60 hz .",
    "the available cmb observations determine the amplitude and spectral slope of the g.w .",
    "spectrum at frequencies around @xmath61 , and this defines the spectrum at higher frequencies .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath62 at frequencies around @xmath61 is determined by the numerical value of the observed quadrupole anisotropy of cmb .",
    "as will be shown in great detail in sec.4 , it follows from the theory of cosmological perturbations that relic gravitational waves should provide a significant fraction of the observed cmb signal at very large angular scales ( barring the logical possibility that the observed anisotropies have nothing to do at all with cosmological perturbations of quantum - mechanical origin ) .    in other words , the final theoretical results do not contain any dimensionless parameter which could be regulated in such a manner as to make the contribution of , say , density perturbations to the quadrupole anisotropy several orders of magnitude larger than the contribution of gravitational waves .",
    "these contributions must be roughly equal , but the theory can not exclude that one of them will turn out to be a numerical factor 2 - 3 larger than another . assuming that relic gravitational waves provide a half of the signal , one can find from the observed @xmath63 that @xmath64 and , hence , it follows from eq.([hb ] ) that @xmath65 .",
    "the slope of the primordial g.w .",
    "spectrum is also taken from cmb observations .",
    "the commonly used spectral index @xmath66 ( we denote it by a roman letter @xmath66 in order to distinguish from the wavenumber @xmath17 ) is related to the parameter @xmath4 appearing in eq.([hb ] ) by the relationship @xmath67 .",
    "the same relationship is valid for density perturbations , to be discussed later .",
    "the current observations @xcite give evidence for @xmath68 , which corresponds to @xmath69 .",
    "the particular graph in fig .",
    "1 is plotted for @xmath70 , which tallies with the cobe data @xcite .",
    "( this spectral index @xmath71 implies that @xmath72 , according to eq.([w ] ) .",
    "it is not difficult to imagine that such an effective equation of state could hold in the very early universe , if the recent supernovae observations hint at the validity of @xmath72 even in the present - day universe ! ) in simple words , the position and orientation of the entire piece - wise function @xmath73 is defined by the known value of the function at the point @xmath74 and the known slope of the function in the vicinity of that point .",
    "incidentally , the initial quantum vacuum conditions for gravitational waves , at all frequencies shown in the graph , are formulated at the ` initial ' moments of time , when each wavelength of interest was appreciably longer than the planck length .",
    "therefore , the shown results are immune to the short scale ambiguities of the so - called ` trans - planckian ' physics ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it is a different matter that at some frequencies the initial state is allowed to be a somewhat excited state , rather than the pure vacuum state , without running into a conflict with the adopted approximation of small perturbations .",
    "this exotic possibility and the corresponding modifications of the spectrum were discussed long time ago @xcite ( see also a related work @xcite ) .",
    "the graph in fig.1 shows the piece - wise envelope of the today s spectrum .",
    "the displayed result is quite approximate . in particular",
    ", it completely ignores the inevitable oscillations in the spectrum , whose origin goes back to the gradual diminishing ( squeezing ) of quantum - mechanical uncertainties in the phases of the emerging waves and the macroscopic manifestation of this effect in the form of the standing - wave pattern of the generated field .",
    "( this is also related to the concept of ` particle pair creation ' . )",
    "we will discuss these spectral oscillations below .    nevertheless , the graph in fig.1 is convenient in that it gives simple answers to the most general questions on the amplitudes and spectral slopes of relic gravitational waves in various frequency intervals .",
    "for example , it shows the expected amplitude @xmath75 at @xmath76 hz . this is the level of the signal that we shall be dealing with in experimental programs . in terms of the parameter @xmath77 , @xmath78 it corresponds to @xmath79 at frequency @xmath76 hz and in its vicinity .    where do we stand now in the attempt of direct detection of relic gravitational waves ?",
    "the sensitivity of the presently operating ground - based interferometers is not good enough to reach the predicted level , but the experimenters are making a lot of progress . the data from the recently completed s3 run of ligo",
    "@xcite will probably allow one to reach the astrophysically interesting level of @xmath80 , as shown in fig .",
    "2 ( courtesy of j. romano and the stochastic backgrounds group of lsc ) . fortunately",
    ", the projected sensitivity of the advanced ligo ( @xmath812011 ) will be sufficient to reach the required level of @xmath82 , when a month - long stretch of cross - correlated data from the two detectors is available .",
    "the esa - nasa space - based mission lisa ( @xmath812013 ) will have a better chance to discover relic gravitational waves .",
    "since the expected spectrum has larger amplitudes at lower frequencies , the detectability condition is potentially improving at lower frequencies . in fig .",
    "3 we show the lisa sensitivity in frequency bins of @xmath83 hz , which corresponds to an observation time of 1 year . this observation time should make it possible to resolve the g.w .",
    "lines from thousands of white dwarf binaries in our galaxy , radiating at frequencies larger than @xmath84 hz . by removing the contribution of the binaries from the observed records , or by using sophisticated data analysis techniques without actually removing the contaminating signals from the data , one can effectively clean up the window of instrumental sensitivity at frequencies above @xmath84 hz .",
    "this window in the area of maximal sensitivity of lisa is shown in the graph together with the expected level of relic gravitational waves in that window .",
    "the expected amplitudes of relic gravitational waves reach their highest level in the frequency interval of @xmath85 hz .",
    "this is why one has very good prospects for indirect detection of relic gravitational waves through the measurements of anisotropies in the distribution over the sky of the cmb temperature and polarisation .",
    "( for an introduction to the theoretical tools of cmb physics , see for example @xcite . )",
    "the accurately calculated power spectrum @xmath86 is shown in fig . 5 @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is calculated at the moment of decoupling ( recombination ) of the cmb , with the redshift of decoupling at @xmath87 .",
    "the derivation of the spectrum takes into account the quantum - mechanical squeezing of the waves phases , which manifests itself macroscopically in the standing - wave character of the generated gravitational waves . from the viewpoint of the underlying physics ,",
    "it is this inevitable quantum - mechanical squeezing that is responsible for the oscillations in the power spectrum .",
    "the displayed spectrum was obtained under the assumption that @xmath88 @xmath89 , i.e. for a flat primordial spectrum .",
    "the survived part of the primordial flat spectrum is seen on the graph as a horizontal part of the curve in the region of very small wavenumbers @xmath17 .",
    "the normalisation of the spectrum is chosen in such a way that the induced quadrupole anisotropy of the cmb today is at the level of the actually observed quadrupole @xcite .",
    "specifically , the temperature function @xmath90 in fig .",
    "4 , calculated from the spectrum in fig . 5 ,",
    "gives the required value of 960 @xmath91 at @xmath92 .",
    "the distribution of other induced multipoles is also shown in fig .",
    "figures 4 and 5 are placed one under another on purpose .",
    "this placement gives a better visual description of the fact noticed and explained previously @xcite .",
    "namely , the oscillations in the metric ( gravitational field ) power spectrum are entirely responsible for the oscillations in the angular power spectrum of the cmb temperature , with almost universal correspondence between extrema in the wavenumber space @xmath17 and extrema in the multipole moment space @xmath93",
    ". if there is much / little power in the gravitational field perturbations of a given interval of wavelengths , one should expect much / little power in the temperature fluctuations at the corresponding angular scale .",
    "it is the oscillations in the metric power spectrum that are responsible for the oscillations in the @xmath93-space , and not the mysterious explanations often repeated in the literature , which claim that the peaks in the function @xmath90 arise because of some waves being caught ( at the moment of decoupling ) in their maxima or minima , while others are not . to illustrate the role of standing gravitational waves and the associated power spectrum oscillations , versus traveling gravitational waves with no power spectrum oscillations , it was explicitely shown @xcite that the later hypothesis does not produce oscillations in the @xmath93-space .",
    "incidentally , it was argued @xcite that in the case of density perturbations , the main contribution to the peaks in the temperature function @xmath90 can also be provided by oscillations in the metric power spectrum , rather than by the temperature variations accompanying sound waves in the photon - electron - baryon plasma at the last scattering surface . in the case of density perturbations ,",
    "the metric power spectrum is mostly associated with the gravitational field of the dark matter , which dominates other matter components in terms of the gravitational field .",
    "oscillations in the metric power spectrum in the early universe are inevitable , and for the same reason as in the g.w.case , namely , because of the standing - wave pattern of the metric perturbations that is related to their quantum - mechanical origin . therefore , the often - discussed  acoustic \" peaks in the @xmath93-space may well turn out to be  gravitational \" peaks .",
    "it remains to be seen how this circumstance can change inferences about cosmological parameters .",
    "we shall now turn to the cmb polarisation .",
    "( for some important papers on cmb polarisation , see for example @xcite . )",
    "it follows from the radiation transfer equations that the polarisation of cmb is mainly determined by the first time - derivative of the metric perturbations in the interval of time when the polarisation is mainly produced .",
    "therefore , it is the power spectrum of the function @xmath94 that is of a primary importance . since the g.w .",
    "field itself , including its normalisation , has been fully determined , the quantity of our interest is directly calculable . in fig .",
    "7 we show @xcite the power spectrum @xmath95 , calculated at the time of decoupling .    the induced @xmath96 and @xmath97 components of polarisation are shown in fig .",
    "this graph was derived under the usual assumptions about the recombination history , which means , in particular , that the polarisation was primarily accumulated during a relatively short interval of time around @xmath98 .",
    "similarly to the case of temperature anisotropies , the extrema in the graphs of fig . 7 and fig . 6",
    "are in a good correspondence with each other .",
    "if there is not much power in the first time - derivative of the metric , you should not expect much power in the polarisation at the corresponding angular scale .",
    "on the other hand , the region of wavenumbers @xmath99 , where there is the first pronounced peak in fig .",
    "7 , is fully responsible for the first pronounced peak in fig .",
    "6 at the corresponding angular scales @xmath100 .    in fig .",
    "8 we combine together some of the expected signals from relic gravitational waves .",
    "they are encoded in the cmb anisotropies and polarisation .",
    "this figure includes also a possible polarisation bump , discussed previously by other authors , at very small @xmath93 s .",
    "this feature arises because of the extended reionisation period in the relatively late universe , around @xmath101 . in agreement with the explanations given above , the amplitude and position of this bump in the @xmath93-space",
    "are determined by the amplitude and position of the first maximum in the power spectrum @xmath102 of the function @xmath94 , calculated at @xmath103 .",
    "the resulting graphs in fig . 6 and fig .",
    "8 are qualitatively similar to the graphs derived by other authors before us .",
    "however , we take the responsibility of claiming that the numerical level of , say , the @xmath97 component of polarisation shown in our graphs is what the observers should expect to see on the sky . of course , this statement assumes that the observed large - scale anisotropies of cmb are caused by cosmological perturbations of quantum - mechanical origin , and not by something else",
    ".    the true level of the @xmath97 signal can be somewhat higher or somewhat lower than the theoretical level shown in our figures .",
    "but the signal can not be , say , several orders of magnitude lower than the one shown on our graphs .",
    "in contrast , the inflationary literature claims that the amount of  inflationary gravitational waves \" vanishes in the limit of the flat primordial spectrum @xmath53 ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "therefore , the most likely level of the @xmath97 mode signal produced by  inflationary gravitational waves \" is close to zero .",
    "this would make the detection impossible in any foreseeable future .",
    "it is a pity that many of our experimentall colleagues , being guided by the wrong theory , are accepting their defeat even before having started to build instruments aimed at detecting relic gravitational waves via the @xmath97 component of polarisation .",
    "their logic seems to be the following : ` we would love to discover the fundamentally important relic gravitational waves , but we were told by inflationists many times that this is very unlikely to happen , so we agreed to feel satisfied even if we succeed only in putting some limits on , say , polarisation properties of dust in the surrounding cosmos ' .",
    "the author of this contribution fears that in a complex experiment like the @xmath97-mode detection , this kind of logic can only lead to overlooking the important signal that the experiment originally targeted .    concluding this section i would like to say as a witness that zeldovich suggested using the cmb polarisation as a g.w .",
    "discriminator , as early as in the very beginning of the 80 s .",
    "this was clearly stated in private conversations , but i am not aware of any written records .",
    "why bother about relic gravitational waves if inflationists claim that the amount of relic gravitational waves ( inflationists and followers call them  inflationary gravitational waves \" ) should be zero or almost zero ?",
    "this claim is a direct consequence of the so - called ",
    "standard inflationary result \" , which is the main contribution of inflationary theorists to the subject of practical , rather than imaginary , cosmology .    in the inflationary scenario ,",
    "the ` initial ' era of the universe expansion is driven by a scalar field @xmath105 with the scalar field potential @xmath106 .",
    "it is in this era that the initial quantum vacuum conditions for cosmological pertubations are being formulated .",
    "the inflationary solutions for the scale factor @xmath0 are close to the desitter evolution characterised by @xmath107 in eq.([a ] ) .",
    "the effective equation of state for the scalar field is always @xmath108 , so that for the power - law intervals of expansion driven by the scalar field , the parameter @xmath4 can only be @xmath109 , see eq.([w ] ) .",
    "therefore , one expects the primordial spectrum of the generated metric perturbations to be almost flat , i.e. the primordial spectral index @xmath66 should be close to @xmath110 , with @xmath111 .",
    "the beginning of the amplifying superadiabatic regime for the given mode of perturbations is often called the ` first hubble radius crossing ' , while the end of this regime for the given mode is often called the ` second hubble radius crossing ' .",
    "the  standard inflationary result \" is formulated for cosmological perturbations called density perturbations ( scalar , @xmath112 , perturbations ) as opposed to the gravitational waves ( tensor , @xmath113 , perturbations ) considered in sec . 1 .",
    "the  standard inflationary result \" states that the final ( second crossing , @xmath114 ) amplitudes of quantities describing density perturbations are related to the initial ( first crossing , @xmath115 ) values of @xmath105 and other quantities , according to the evaluation : @xmath116    the numerator of the last term on the r.h.s . of eq.([sir ] ) is the value of the hubble parameter taken at the moment of time when the given mode enters the superadiabatic regime .",
