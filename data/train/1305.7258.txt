    "_ d_-electrons can spontaneously split into spin - up and spin - down sub - bands , which leads to ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "although the stoner theory@xcite provides the grounds for understanding the itinerant ferromagnetic state , there are still questions left to be answered about the role of spin fluctuations and the quantum criticality in the itinerant ferromagnetic systems .",
    "itinerant ferromagnets are of particular interest for studying the mechanism of magnetism and superconductivity near a quantum critical point ( qcp ) . unlike the classical phase transitions driven by temperature ,",
    "a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) at zero temperature is driven by non - thermal parameters.@xcite a qcp is thought to be a singularity in the ground state , at which point the characteristic energy scale of fluctuations above the ground state vanishes.@xcite in itinerant ferromagnets , the temperature dependence of the magnetic properties has often been interpreted in terms of spin fluctuations.@xcite with the spin fluctuations , an ordered ground state can change into a non - ordered state by crossing a qcp .",
    "non - fermi liquid behaviors of the materials associated with a qcp can often be observed , such as the temperature divergences of the physical properties.@xcite moreover , superconductivity has been discovered in the vicinity of a qcp in weakly ferromagnetic systems , such as in the case of uge@xmath9@xcite and ucoge@xcite . on the boundary of a ferromagnetic state at low temperatures ,",
    "a strong longitudinal magnetic susceptibility and magnetic interactions may lead to a superconducting state.@xcite the parallel - spin quasiparticles in the ferromagnetic system should form pairs in odd - parity orbitals , based on pauli exclusion principle .",
    "theories suggest this type of superconductivity should be spin - triplet and magnetically mediated.@xcite thus , the suppression of ferromagnetism and the search for a qcp in the itinerant ferromagnetic systems may offer a better understanding of the magnetically mediated superconductivity and non - fermi liquid behaviors .",
    "chemical doping , pressure and magnetic field are often used to tune the magnetic orderings , and drive the criticality .",
    "for example , a qcp emerges in zr@xmath1nb@xmath0zn@xmath9 when the doping level reaches @xmath10 = 0.083,@xcite and in cepd@xmath1ni@xmath0 when the doping level is 0.95.@xcite ybagge@xcite , ybptbi@xcite and ybrh@xmath9si@xmath9@xcite can be driven to field induced qcps associated with a non - fermi - liquid behavior in the resistivity . in the case of mnsi@xcite and uge@xmath9,@xcite",
    "itinerant - electron magnetism disappears at a first order transition and a qpt appears as pressure is applied .",
    "lacrge@xmath2 was reported to be metallic and to order ferromagnetically at 78 k.@xcite it forms in a hexagonal perovskite type ( space group @xmath11 ) structure .",
    "previous work suggests it is an itinerant ferromagnet , with an estimated effective moment , 1.4 @xmath12/f.u .",
    ", significantly lower than the expected values of cr@xmath13 ( 2.8 @xmath12 ) or cr@xmath14 ( 3.8 @xmath12).@xcite lavge@xmath2 , adopted the same crystal structure , is found to be non - magnetic above 2 k.@xcite based on the band structure calculated for both compounds , it is claimed that they have very similar dos features and can probably be explained by the rigid band model.@xcite for lacrge@xmath2 , the _ d_-state of cr manifests as a sharp peak near the fermi level in the dos , consistent with itinerant ferromagnetism as suggested by the stoner model.@xcite lavge@xmath2 , with fewer electrons , fills the band up to a lower energy level .",
    "thus , the fermi level of lavge@xmath2 lies at a local minimum of the dos , and shows paramagnetic behavior .",
    "to suppress the ferromagnetism in this system , substituting v for cr in lav@xmath0cr@xmath1ge@xmath2 is one of the rational choices , since this is expected to tune the dos by changing the position of the fermi level .",
    "studies of polycrystalline samples show that v - substitution does change the magnetic exchange interactions , and the long - range magnetic ordering is suppressed.@xcite only the temperature dependence of magnetization was measured on the polycrystalline samples , and the precise stoichiometry of this doped system was not analyzed by chemical or physical measurement .",
    "the v - concentration dependence of curie temperature was not reported , and it is not clear at which concentration the ferromagnetism is fully suppressed .",
    "detailed measurements of transport and thermodynamic properties of the doped system are needed , since they allow to follow the evolution of the ferromagnetism and shed light on its mechanism .    besides chemical substitution",
    ", an itinerant magnetic system can often be perturbed by applying pressure .",
    "thus , for the lav@xmath0cr@xmath1ge@xmath2 series , pressure can also be used to suppress the magnetic state and discover a possible qcp .    in this work ,",
    "we report the synthesis of single crystalline lav@xmath0cr@xmath1ge@xmath2 ( _ x _ = 0  0.21 , 1.00 ) samples , and present a systematic study of their transport and thermodynamic properties . a ferromagnetic transition has been confirmed , and the system shows a strong axial anisotropy in its ordered state .",
    "both of the effective moment and the saturated moment per cr decrease systematically as v - concentration increases , indicating that the cr moment is fragile and the system is an itinerant ferromagnet .",
    "the curie temperature decreases with v - substitution .",
    "the magnetic ordering is suppressed down to 36 k for the highest level of v - substitution obtained ( @xmath3 = 0.21 , other than the non - magnetic lavge@xmath2 ) . given that ferromagnetism is not completely suppressed by our highest level of v - substitution , measurements of magnetization under pressure were performed on the @xmath3 = 0.16 sample .",

    "[ fig : eff ] , as @xmath3 increases , the slope of the @xmath15 curve rises gradually , and the curie - weiss temperature decreases from 91.7 k for @xmath3 = 0 to 6.7 k for @xmath3 = 0.21 monotonically .",
    "the positive @xmath21 values indicate that ferromagnetic interactions are dominant in this series .",
    "the decrease in @xmath21 suggests that the ferromagnetic interaction is suppressed by v doping .",
    "based on all of these results , it is highly likely that the cr ions in the lav@xmath0cr@xmath1ge@xmath2 compounds manifest non - local - moment like behavior .    the electrical resistivity as a function of temperature for lav@xmath0cr@xmath1ge@xmath2 is presented in fig .
