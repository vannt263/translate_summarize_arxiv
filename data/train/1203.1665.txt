    "blueprints are a common generalization of commutative ( semi)rings and monoids .",
    "the associated geometric objects , blue schemes , are therefore a common generalization of usual scheme theory and @xmath1geometry ( as considered by kato @xcite , deitmar @xcite and connes - consani @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility of forming semiring schemes allows us to talk about idempotent schemes and tropical schemes ( cf .",
    "all this is worked out in @xcite .",
    "it is known , though not covered in literature yet , that the @xmath0-construction from usual algebraic geometry has an analogue in @xmath1-geometry ( after kato , deitmar and connes - consani ) . in this note",
    "we describe a generalization of this to blueprints . in private communication ,",
    "koen thas announced a treatment of @xmath0 for monoidal schemes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we follow the notations and conventions of @xcite .",
    "namely , all blueprints that appear in this note are proper and with a zero .",
    "we remark that the following constructions can be carried out for the more general notion of a blueprint as considered in @xcite ; the reason that we restrict to proper blueprints with a zero is that this allows us to adopt a notation that is common in @xmath1-geometry .",
    "namely , we denote by @xmath3 the ( blue ) affine @xmath4-space @xmath5\\bigr)$ ] over a blueprint @xmath6 . in case of a ring , this does not equal the usual affine @xmath4-space since @xmath7 $ ] is not closed under addition .",
    "therefore , we denote the usual affine @xmath4-space over a ring @xmath6 by @xmath8^+\\bigr)$ ] . similarly , we use a superscript `` @xmath9 '' for the usual projective space @xmath10 and the usual grassmannian @xmath11 over a ring @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath6 be a blueprint and @xmath12 a subset of @xmath6 .",
    "we say that @xmath12 is _ additively closed in @xmath6 _",
    "if for all additive relations @xmath13 with @xmath14 also @xmath15 is an element of @xmath12 . note that , in particular , @xmath16 is an element of @xmath12 .",
    "graded blueprint _ is a blueprint @xmath6 together with additively closed subsets @xmath17 for @xmath18 such that @xmath19 , such that for all @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , the product @xmath23 is an element of @xmath24 and such that for every @xmath25 , there are a unique finite subset @xmath26 of @xmath27 and unique non - zero elements @xmath28 for every @xmath29 such that @xmath30 .",

    "the subblueprint @xmath34 equals @xmath6 if and only if for all @xmath35 , @xmath36 . in this case",
    "we say that @xmath6 is _ trivially graded_. by the uniqueness of the decomposition into homogeneous elements , we have @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",

    "since @xmath39 is multiplicatively closed , it can be seen as a subblueprint of @xmath6 .",
