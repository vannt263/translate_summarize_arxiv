    "active galactic nuclei  ( agns ) are believed to be powered by gravitational energy released from accreting matter onto supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies .",
    "the electromagnetic spectra of agns are observed in broadband ranging from radio to @xmath6-ray , however , the agn spectra are possibly contaminated by the components of stellar processes related to star - forming activity in their host galaxies . in the radio regime at lower than @xmath1  ghz , optically - thin synchrotron emissions from agn jets and/or supernova remnants dominate the spectral energy distributions  ( seds ) and are generally thought to exhibit a steep spectrum with a spectral index of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the flux density at the frequency @xmath10 .",
    "however , agns show a wide variety of radio spectral shapes .",
    "blazars generally show flat spectra ( @xmath11 ) with significant flux variations , as a result of dominance of radio cores by relativistic beaming effect due to innermost fast jets aligned close to our line of sight @xcite .",
    "compact strong radio sources with no significant variation frequently exhibit convex spectra peaking at @xmath12  mhz ( compact steep spectrum : css ) and @xmath13  ghz ( gigahertz - peaked spectrum : gps ) , which are caused by absorption of low - frequency radio on small - scaled radio galaxies that are young or reactivated recently ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "nearby low - luminosity agns are frequently detected as weak radio sources , which show flat or slightly inverted spectra for a spatially - extracted nuclear component @xcite ; their origin is still unclear , although a compact jet base powered by radiatively inefficient accretion flows  ( riaf ) at a low accretion rate is the most promising candidate @xcite .",
    "such component of flat or slightly inverted spectra sometimes dominate at millimeter bands ( @xmath12  ghz ) rather than the steep spectrum synchrotron emission , free ",
    "free emission , and dust emission associated with the host galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite reported the discovery of `` high frequency excess ( hfe ) '' in radio continuum spectra of several radio - quiet quasars / luminous seyferts on the basis of early vla observations at 1.514.9  ghz .",
    "the hfes show a steep spectrum at low frequencies but flatter or inverted at higher frequencies ( @xmath14  ghz ) .",
    "the physical origin of the high - frequency component is unclear .",
    "these luminous agns might not be the case applicable to the riaf for low accretion rates .",
    "@xcite discussed the physical validity of self - absorbed synchrotron from a compact agn radio core and free  free emission related to agn and stellar activities . on the basis of the coexistence of radio variability and flat or inverted spectrum as well as a vlbi detection , @xcite suggested that radio cores as scaled - down versions of those seen in radio loud quasars are more likely in these radio - quiet quasars .",
    "@xcite also found millimeter radio excesses in several radio quiet agns , and suggest accretion disk coronal emissions as its origin ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite predict a synchrotron luminosity detectable in the submillimeter regime if nonthermal electrons in addition to thermal ones are present in a magnetized disk corona in a nearby seyfert galaxy .",
    "ngc  985 ( mrk  1048 ) , a luminous seyfert type-1 galaxy located at a redshift of 0.0427 , was one of the sample of @xcite and @xcite and showed one of the most prominent signature of the hfe : a steep spectrum at 1.48.4  ghz and an inverted spectrum at 8.415  ghz .",
    "the luminosity of ngc  985 is @xmath15 , which puts this object in the luminous infrared galaxy group .",
    "this is a peculiar galaxy with a prominent ring - shaped zone at several kiloparsecs from the nucleus @xcite , suggesting that the galaxy is undergoing a merging process .",
    "the galaxy contains a double nucleus ( a seyfert nucleus and a non - agn ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; the nuclei are separated by 3  arcsec ( 2.5  kpc of projected distance ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which indicates that the intruder galaxy responsible for the formation of the ring is sinking in the nuclear potential of the primary galaxy @xcite .",
    "an ionized absorber has been observed in the x - ray spectra of ngc  985 , indicating the presence of ionized outflows with velocities of @xmath16500  km / s @xcite , as well as a hard x - ray component suggesting inverse - compton radiation from corona on an accretion disk of the seyfert nucleus .",
    "studies including other radio observations have been made by @xcite , which mainly mentioned a low - frequency ( @xmath17  ghz ) radio structure on the basis of vla observations at higher angular resolutions .",
    "these results will be incorporated into our study for the spectrum of ngc  985 at the radio - to - fir regime .",

    "we conducted new vla observations toward ngc  985 at 22  ghz on 2001 september  28 with the cnd - configuration ( ad456 ) and at quasi - simultaneous 8.4643.3  ghz on 2003 december  24  with the b - configuration ( ad489 ) .",
    "the 15 , 22 , and 43-ghz observations were carried out by fast switching of antenna pointing between the target source and a nearby calibrator to reduce atmospheric phase fluctuations for long baselines .",

    "we reduced the data in the standard manners using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ; * ? ? ? * ) , developed at the national radio astronomy observatory  ( nrao ) .",
    "the calibrator 3c  48 served a flux scaling factor at each frequency .",
    "we followed the guidelines for accurate flux density bootstrapping @xcite , including correcting the dependence of the gain curve on elevation for the antennas and atmospheric opacity and by using the source structure models in self - calibrations .",
    "the bootstrap accuracy should be 1%2% at 20 , 6 , and 3.6  cm , and perhaps 3%5% at 2 , 1.3 , and 0.7  cm @xcite . in the present study , for scaling factors , we assumed uncertainties of 3% and 5% at 8.46  ghz and 14.943.3  ghz , respectively .",
    "all target images were synthesized from calibrated visibilities with natural weighting and deconvolved with the clean algorithm using the aips task imagr .",

    "ab489 data with the vla - d / a hybrid array was imaged from visibilities tapered to 100  k@xmath29 resulting in @xmath30 resolution .",

    "for the present study , we retrieved the image data of @xcite from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database  ( ned ) archive , and then , analyzed it and found a compact component of @xmath32  mjy for the untapered case .",
    "we observed ngc  985 using the nobeyama millimeter array  ( nma ) on 2003  april  26 , may  14 , 24 , and 25 .",
    "we used the d - configuration that is the most compact array configuration , resulting in half - power beam widths ( hpbws ) of synthesized beams of @xmath33 .",
    "visibility data were obtained with double - sided receiving system at centre frequencies of 89.725 and 101.725  ghz , where each band has a bandwidth of 1  ghz , i.e. , 2  ghz in total .",
    "the ultra wide - band correlator ( uwbc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was used .",
    "typical system noise temperature , @xmath34 , is about 150  k. we made scans of b0238@xmath35084  ( ngc  1052 ) every 25  minutes for gain calibration .",
    "bandpass calibrators of 3c  279 or 3c  454.3 were observed once a day .",
    "the data were reduced using the uvproc - ii package , developed at the nobeyama radio observatory  ( nro ) .",
    "visibilities of both the sidebands were combined with the same weight , which resulted in an averaged centre frequency of 95.725  ghz ( @xmath36  mm ) .",
    "each daily image was individually processed in natural weighting , and then deconvolved using the aips .",
    "furthermore , the visibilities of all the days were combined with a weight of @xmath37 , resulting in an aggregated observing time of 12.6  hours , and then imaged .",
    "flux scales of the gain calibrator were derived with the uncertainty to 10  per  cent by relative comparisons to flux - known calibrators like the uranus , which were scanned quasi - simultaneously at almost the same elevations .",
    "consequently , no significant emission appeared above three - times the r.m.s .  of image noise ( @xmath38  mjy  beam@xmath20 ) .",
    "the new results are listed in table  [ table : observation ] and plotted in figure  [ figure : spectrum ] , which also include data from the literature . in all detected cases ,",
    "a single emission component was found .",
    "its flux density and deconvolved size were measured using the aips task jmfit , gaussian - profile model fitting .",
    "the error of the flux measurements was determined by root - sum - squares of image noise , the fitting error , and the flux scaling uncertainty . in non - detections , we defined three times the image r.m.s .",
    "noise ( @xmath39 ) as the upper limit of flux density .",
    "the source was apparently unresolved in any detected cases .",
    "the radio source size was constrained to be @xmath40 , corresponding to @xmath5  pc ; the vla observation an114 provided an image with the highest quality and the upper limit of deconvolved size with a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath41 and a major - axis beam size of @xmath42 .",
    "radio photometry using interferometry is sometimes affected by resolution effect if a radio structure is significantly larger than fringe spacings of its shortest baselines . at @xmath43  ghz ,",
    "the nvss flux density ( vla - d at a @xmath44 resolution ) is significantly larger than the results of vla - c and vla - d / a hybrid ( tapered to 100  k@xmath29 resulting in @xmath30 at all frequencies ) by @xcite ( figure  [ figure : spectrum ] ) ; this is clear evidence of resolution effect .",
    "the radio morphology of ngc  985 , which has been presented by @xcite on the basis of vla - d observations at 4.9 and 8.4  ghz , exhibited a twin - peaks ( separated by @xmath45 ) with a brighter component associated with the position of the seyfert nucleus and a second one which lies to the west just inside the outer ring of the host galaxy , the latter of which is presumably related to star forming activity .",
    "@xcite reported the result of vla - a observation at 4.89  ghz toward the seyfert nucleus as a total flux density of @xmath31  mjy from heavily tapered visibility data while @xmath13  mjy in the untapered map ( @xmath32  mjy by our re - analysis ; section  [ section : vlaarchivaldata ] ) ; therefore , the authors pointed out that the bulk of the radio emission toward the agn is probably from an extended , low surface brightness component .",
    "the vla - d observation at 4.9  ghz showing 3.38  mjy for the nucleus supports this picture @xcite .",
    "thus , a substantial fraction of the brighter emission itself originates in low - brightness component .",
    "similarly , the discrepancy between our vla - a and vla - b results at 8.46  ghz ( table  [ table : observation ] ) is possibly attributed to the resolution effect on such a radio structure .",
    "thus , as in the lower - frequency emission ( @xmath46  ghz ) , it is unclear whether the physical origin is agn jets or star forming activity , which is discussed later in section  [ section : discussion ] . on the other hand",
    ", we have no evidence of resolving out for the higher - frequency emission .    the contribution from the secondary nucleus ,",
    "which is a non - agn and separated by @xmath47 , is negligible for the radio photometry toward the seyfert nucleus .",
    "no signature of the radio emission appeared at the putative location of the secondary nucleus in the vla - a image with the highest sensitivity ( @xmath28  mjy  beam@xmath20 at 8.46  ghz ) in the present study , even in a heavily tapered map .",
    "the resultant radio spectrum ( figure  [ figure : spectrum ] ) consists of two components : ( 1 )  a steep spectrum from @xmath13  ghz to @xmath1  ghz ( @xmath0 , where @xmath8 ) , and ( 2 )  an inverted spectrum from @xmath1  ghz at least up to @xmath48  ghz ( @xmath2 ) ; we used the data of aa48 , ab486 , and ad489 , which were obtained at multi - frequency quasi - simultaneously , for determining these spectral indices .",
    "the hfe previously discovered at 8.4614.9  ghz by @xcite ( open squares in figure  [ figure : spectrum ] ) ; two 22.5  ghz observations in 1985 and 1990 , which had not been published although observed quasi - simultaneously with the lower frequencies , showed upper limits that are not so strong constraint to rule out the continuity of the hfe .",
    "our observation on 2001 at 22.5  ghz showed a detection and provided evidence for the presence of the hfe at a higher frequency . on 2003 ,",
    "our nma observation resulted in a non - detection , which provides an insufficient constraint to probe a potential peak on spectrum .",
    "finally , our vla observations at quasi - simultaneous multi - frequency showed a clear evidence of the hfe up to 43.3  ghz .",
    "the transition frequencies between a steep and an inverted spectra ( @xmath1  ghz ) on 1990 and 2003 seem to be different .",
    "the optical position of the seyfert nucleus is r.a.@xmath49 , decl.@xmath50 ( an error of @xmath51 ) on the basis of the sloan digital sky survey data release  9 ( sdss  dr9 ; * ? ? ?",

    "on the other hand , many observations for nearby llagns indicate that radio luminosities roughly an order of magnitude greater than those predicted by the adaf model @xcite ; more efficient ( thermal ) synchrotron emission from a jet base , which may corresponds to a steady jet in x - ray binaries in the low / hard state , may additionally contribute the observed radio luminosities @xcite .",
    "the llagn ngc  266 is an example clearly showing the coexistence of steep and inverted spectral components @xcite , the latter of which can be attributed to the adaf and jet base components .",
    "however , ngc  985 is a relatively luminous seyfert with a eddington ratio of 0.02 , which is possibly higher than a critical accretion rate for the application of the adaf model .",
    "we attempt to calculate an expected radio flux density from the adaf according to the model presented by @xcite ; as a result , only @xmath139  mjy would be expected at 43.395.7  ghz from thermal hot electrons with @xmath140  k ; even a ten - times larger value as a jet base would be insufficient for the observed hfe .",
    "this discussion suggests only thermal synchrotron process can not be responsible for the observed luminosity .",
    "@xcite presented that the synchrotron from nonthermal electrons in corona above an accretion disk of nearby seyfert galaxies is potentially detectable at the submillimeter regime using the alma sensitivities .",
    "a strong correlation is known to exist between the quiescent radio and x - ray emission in coronally active cool stars : radio - to - x - ray ratio @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "if the same mechanism magnetically heats corona above accretion disks , agns may also satisfy this relation ; @xcite predicts that the signature of x - ray emitting corona from radio - quiet quasars possibly appears in the millimeter band , because of synchrotron self - absorption making spectra strongly inverted with the index @xmath142 , which is significantly flatter than that of dust spectrum ( @xmath143@xmath144 ) in the rayleigh - jeans region ( section  [ section : dust ] ) . for ngc  985@xmath145  kev , which was converted from that at @xmath146@xmath147  kev with the photon index @xmath148 @xcite , and an radio luminosity at 5  ghz estimated by a spectral extrapolation with @xmath95 ( optically - thin ) from the observed flux density at 43.3  ghz for the hfe component .",
    "] , @xmath149 , which is consistent with this correlation .    using the model of @xcite",
    ", we found realistic parameters of the physical condition of corona that is required from both the observed luminosities of x - ray and hfe radio emissions from the ngc  985 nucleus : @xmath150 schwarzschild radius for the corona size , an equipartition magnetic field of 150  gauss , the 10%-eddington ratio , an electron temperature of 100  kev , and the non - thermal energy fraction @xmath151% .",
    "such a corona size is roughly consistent with the sizes estimated by observations for several agns possibly showing millimeter excesses @xcite and the day - scale variability @xcite . at this time ,",
    "our radio data are still in a limited quality .",
    "precise sed modeling based on ( quasi-)simultaneous alma  x - ray observations would be demanded to discriminate the coronal origin from other processes .",
    "the radio spectrum including high - frequency excess  ( hfe ) that previously discovered by @xcite toward the seyfert nucleus in ngc  985 has been confirmed by our new observations at higher radio frequencies as well .",
    "the steep spectrum at low frequencies can be interpreted as the stellar origin of the star - forming activity in this merging galaxy .",
    "dust emission at the rayleigh - jeans regime , compact jets under synchrotron self - absorption , or thermal synchrotron from hot accretion flow such as adaf can not be responsible for the observed hfe .",
    "on the other hand , we can not rule out the free  free emission from blr clouds , synchrotron jets free ",
    "free absorbed by a circumnucler photo - ionized region , and self - absorbed nonthermal synchrotron from disk corona as the origin of the hfe , with limited qualities of data at this time .",
    "conclusive evidence for determining the origin of hfe would be obtained by more detailed high - frequency radio spectrum from future alma observations with a high - angular resolution ( sufficient for resolving extended components ) in cooperation with ( quasi)-simultaneous observations at optical ( blr clouds radiating free  free emission ) and x - ray ( corona radiating nonthermal synchrotron ) to investigate the correlation of time variations .",
