    "he ever - increasing loading of transmission networks together with a steady increase in load demands has pushed the operation conditions of many power systems ever closer to their stability limits @xcite-@xcite .",
    "voltage stability has become one of the major concerns for the secure operation of power systems .",
    "voltage stabilities are classified into transient voltage stability , mid - term stability and long - term stability based on different time scales .",
    "the distinction between mid - term and long - term can be based on neither fixed time - frame basis nor modelling requirements@xcite , hence we only use long - term time scale in this paper to denote the one beyond the transient time scale for stability analysis .",
    "this paper considers the long - term voltage stability model .",
    "power system dynamic models are large and involve different time scales , and it is time - consuming and data - demanding to simulate the dynamic behaviors over long time intervals .",
    "based on the idea of time scale decomposition , the quasi steady - state ( qss ) @xcite@xcite seeks to reach a good compromise between accuracy and efficiency",
    ". however , there are certain limitations of the qss model such as singularity problem .",
    "when this happens , the newton iterations diverge in practice and the simulation can not proceed .",
    "there are several papers that addressed the singularity problem and tried to solve it by a combination of detailed simulation and the qss approximation@xcite , newton method with optimal multiplier @xcite , and continuation method @xcite .",
    "however , less attention has been paid to a severe situation when the assessment based on the qss model is not reliable . in this situation ,",
    "the qss model gives incorrect stability assessments in long - term stability analysis which means the qss model concludes the stability of the complete model , which is in fact unstable . due to the existence of these situations",
    ", the qss model may not consistently give conservative stability analysis of the complete model .",
    "in other words , the qss model does not work under certain conditions , thus sufficient conditions are needed under which the qss model provides correct stability assessment of the complete model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sectiondymodel ] and section [ sectionqssmodel ] briefly introduce the basic concept of complete dynamic model and the qss model with numerical examples .",
    "section [ counterexample ] presents two counter examples in which the qss model fails to provide correct approximations of the complete model . specifically , while the qss model is stable , the complete model suffers from voltage instabilities",
    "also , theoretical explanation for this failure is presented .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are stated in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the complete power system model for calculating system dynamic response relative to a disturbance comprises a set of first - order differential equations and a set of algebraic equations@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the algebraic equations : @xmath0 describing the electrical transmission system and the internal static behaviors of passive devices . while the transient dynamics are captured by differential equations : @xmath1 which describe the internal dynamics of devices such as synchronous generator and its associated excitation system , interconnecting transmission network together with static load , induction and synchronous motor loads , as well as other devices such as hvdc converter and svc . @xmath2 and @xmath3 are smooth functions , and vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the corresponding short - term state variables and algebraic variables respectively . both continuous equations and discrete - time equations are needed to represent long - term dynamics : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the continuous and discrete long - term state variables respectively , and @xmath9 is the maximum time constant among devices .",
    "these equations describe the dynamics of exponential recovery load and thermostatically recovery load , turbine governor , ltc , oxl and armature current limiter , as well as shunt capacitor / reactor switching all belongs to long - term dynamics .",
    "note that shunt switching and ltc are typical discrete components captured by eqn ( [ longtermdiscrete ] ) .",
    "usually , transient ( model ) dynamics have much smaller time constants compared with those of long - term dynamics , as a result , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are also termed as slow state variables , and @xmath12 are termed as fast state variables . if we represent the above equations in @xmath13 time scale where @xmath14 , and we denote @xmath15 as @xmath16 , then we have : @xmath17 hence , the complete power system dynamic model involves different time scales which makes the time domain simulation over long time intervals very demanding .",
    "the qss model based on time - scale decomposition is proposed in @xcite@xcite@xcite and will be briefly stated in the following section .",
    "the quasi steady - state ( qss ) model is derived using the idea of time - scale decomposition and aims to offer a good compromise between the efficiency and accuracy@xcite . in the qss model ,",
    "the differential equations describing transient dynamics are replaced by their equilibrium equations under the assumption that transient dynamics are stable and settle down infinitely fast in the long - term time scale .",
    "table [ table1 ] illustrates the concept of time - scale decomposition .",
    "the transient model is obtained by assuming that slow variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 are constant parameters . while in the qss model , the transient dynamic equations ( [ longtermeqn ] ) are replaced by the corresponding equilibrium equations : @xmath18    .the mathematical description of model for power system [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     under certain conditions , the qss model performs quite well with similar accuracy as the detailed complete model , while it takes much less time to simulate if a larger time step or adaptive time steps are implemented . also , compared with the complete model",
    ", the jacobian matrix of the qss model does not need to be updated at every time step , and it can be updated only following discrete events such as ltc or oxl activation unless slow convergence rate is observed@xcite . as a result , the qss model is faster to simulate than the complete model .",
    "this paper focus on the accuracy and reliability of the qss model instead of efficiency , thus the same time step as that of the complete model will be used and the jacobian of the qss model is updated at every time step as the complete model .",
    "a numerical example is presented below which shows the trajectory comparison between the complete model and the qss model . the qss model and the complete model",
    "finally settle down to the same long - term stable equilibrium point ( sep ) in this case , and the qss model provides a good approximation of the complete model in long - term stability analysis .",
    "however this is not always true which can be seen from the counter examples presented in section [ counterexample ] .",
    "the numerical study was performed using psat 2.1.6@xcite on a modified model of ieee 14-bus test system whose one - line diagram is attached in appendix [ numerical_ap ] .",
    "there was a fault at bus 9 at 1s and the fault was cleared at 1.083s by opening the breaker between bus 10 and bus 9 . in the complete model , the fast variables settled down by 30s after the contingency , while the dynamics of load tap changer , turbine governors and exponential load evolved in a longer time period .",
    "the qss model was used starting from 30s when transient dynamics almost settled down . when the qss model was used , fast variables converged infinitely fast when slow variables evolved .",
    "finally , both the qss model and the complete model converged to the same long - term sep .",

    "[ my14completeqss ] .",
    "before presenting numerical examples , relevant definitions are needed to give a theoretical explanation of the simulation results .",
    "if we are interested in the study region @xmath19 , both models have the same set of equilibrium points , that is @xmath20 .",
    "assuming @xmath21 is an asymptotically long - term sep of both the qss model and the complete model starting from @xmath22 , and let @xmath23 be the trajectory of the complete model and @xmath24 be the trajectory of the qss model starting from the same initial point , then the stability region for the complete model are defined as : @xmath25    for the qss model , its dynamics are constrained to the set : @xmath26 which is termed as the constraint manifold .",
    "note that the constraint manifold may not be smooth due to the discrete behavior of @xmath11 .",

    "the qss model has some limitations in dealing with severe disturbances . as stated in @xcite",
    ", the qss model can not reproduce the instabilities where the slow variables trigger instability of fast variables .",
    "this means the qss model can not capture the insecure cases when the fast variables are excited by the slow variables , thus result in voltage instabilities .",
    "in addition , the qss model may converge to another stable equilibrium point different from the one the complete model converges to . under these two situations ,",
    "the qss model does not capture the dynamic behavior of the complete model and give inaccurate approximations of the complete model . in brief , the qss model can lead to incorrect stability assessment .",
    "this system was set up based on the modified ieee-14 bus system in section [ sectionqssmodel ] .",
    "apart from the two turbine governors at bus 1 and bus 2 , there were three exponential recovery loads at bus 9 , bus 10 and bus 14 respectively , and five over excitation limiters were added for each exciter which started to work after a fixed delay 10s . besides there were three load tap changers which are discrete models@xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the lap changer ratio .",

    "[ my14completeqss_try ] .    in this case , the qss model failed to give a correct approximation of the complete model .",
    "the time domain simulation of the complete model stopped and stated that there was `` singularity likely '' in the system around 101.2155s ( 71.8155@xmath13 ) , while the qss model did not encounter such problems and continued to converge to the long - term sep . from fig .",
    "[ my14completeqss_try ] , it can be seen that in the complete model , fast dynamics @xmath12 were excited when slow variables evolved .",
    "the violent variation of fast variables @xmath12 due to slow variables finally resulted in voltage instability of the complete model such that it did not converge to the same asymptotically sep as the qss model . however , if we only look at the qss model , the dynamics of fast variables @xmath12 due to slow variables are not noticeable since @xmath12 and @xmath44 converged to the transient seps immediately",
    ". therefore , if the state of long - term sep is acceptable , the post - fault system will be misclassified as stable . in this case , the assumption behind the qss model that transient dynamics are stable in long - term time scale is violated .",
