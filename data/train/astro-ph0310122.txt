    "a proven fruitful way of probing galactic magnetic fields is by way of faraday rotation in the magneto - ionic ism .",
    "traditionally , the galactic magnetic field is probed by determining the rotation measure @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the thermal electron density in @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the magnetic field component along the line of sight in @xmath4 g , and @xmath5 is the path length of the polarized radiation in pc ) of pulsars and linearly polarized extragalactic point sources ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , due to their sparse and irregular distribution in the sky a better background to study magnetic field structures on degree scales with is the polarized component of the diffuse galactic synchrotron background .",
    "however , depolarization of a beam ( beam depolarization ) occurs if there is structure in polarization angle on scales below the beam width .",
    "this can destroy the linear relation between polarization angle @xmath6 and wavelength squared @xmath7 and therefore hamper a reliable rm determination .",
    "furthermore , if synchrotron emission and faraday rotation occur in the same medium , depolarization along the line of sight ( depth depolarization ) will change the polarization characteristics as well ( @xcite ) .",
    "depth depolarization can also destroy the linear @xmath8 relation and can cause apparent jumps in rm ( @xcite ) . furthermore , as radiation originating at large distances is more easily depolarized , most of the observed polarization probes the nearby medium .",
    "the effective `` polarization horizon '' depends on frequency and bandwidth , and varies with position .",
    "the polarization horizon has been estimated to be 600  pc for 350  mhz observations ( @xcite ) , and ( less than ) a few kpc at 1.4  ghz ( @xcite ) .",
    "many observations show discrete faraday rotation structures in polarized intensity @xmath9 and/or polarization angle @xmath6 which are not visible in total intensity , nor related to maps in any other wavelength .",
    "a particularly intriguing structure is a ring in polarization in a @xmath10 field centered at @xmath11 observed with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) at five frequencies around 350  mhz , discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the structure is ring - like in @xmath9 , and shows a regular increase in @xmath6 from the center outwards ( fig .",
    "[ f_ringq ] ) .",
    "this figure also shows rm , which is the most negative in the center , increases outwards and is positive outside the radius of the ring in @xmath9 . as a change in sign of rm indicates a change in direction of @xmath3 , the direction of the parallel magnetic field must reverse in the ring .",
    "furthermore , the strength of @xmath3 and/or @xmath1 must be at a maximum in the center of the ring .",
    "this behavior rules out any circularly symmetric origin of the structure , such as a snr s , stellar winds or hii regions , as these structures would show symmetric magnetic field structure along the line of sight , or a maximal magnetic field along the edges of the structure .",
    "therefore , this structure is most likely predominantly magnetic and funnel - like , with a maximum magnetic field in the center directed away from the observer . as in this orientation",
    "both @xmath3 and @xmath5 are maximal , magnetic tunnels in other orientations may have too low rm compared to the background to be observed",
    ".    more circular or elliptical structures in polarization have been observed ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "as rm information is not yet available for any of them , it is not possible to distinguish between an electron density or magnetic field structure .",
    "if all these structures have the same origin , magnetic tunnels of parsec size could be fairly common in the ism .",
    "maps of @xmath9 at different frequencies and resolution show narrow extended `` depolarization canals '' ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the canals are exactly one beam wide , and the polarization angle changes by 90@xmath12 across them ( fig .",
    "[ f_canal ] ) .",
    "both beam depolarization and depth depolarization give this signature , but the two depolarization mechanisms demand a different underlying rm structure .",
    "if the canals are caused by beam depolarization , rm must exhibit a sudden change of @xmath13 within one beam .",
    "if depth depolarization is responsible for the canals , the rm within a canal must be @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , canals due to beam depolarization do not shift in position with frequency ( as observed ) , whereas depth depolarization canals do .",
    "[ f_canal ]    to study the true rm vs.  the rm computed from the observations , we constructed numerical models of the magneto - ionic ism using the 3d eulerian mhd code zeus-3d ( @xcite , @xcite ) . to simulate a faraday screen ,",
    "the modeled ism was irradiated with a polarized background , see fig .",
    "[ f_model ] .",
    "the `` observables '' of the radiation after propagation through the model , stokes @xmath15 and @xmath16 , were smoothed with a gaussian of width @xmath17 pixels to simulate beam depolarization . as there is no depth depolarization in this model , we can estimate the effect of purely beam depolarization on the radiation ( @xcite ) .     and",
    "@xmath16 distributions are smoothed to simulate a telescope beam , and rm is computed from the smoothed @xmath15 and @xmath16 similar to the observations . ]",
    "the most obvious result of the models is that they produce depolarization canals similar to the canals observed in many @xmath9 maps .",
    "the canals are created at positions where the rm shows a sharp gradient in one dimension .",
    "if the magnitude of the rm gradient is @xmath18 ( @xmath19  rad  m@xmath20 at 350  mhz ) , the angle difference will be @xmath21  rad , causing complete depolarization .",
    "so these models show that beam depolarization can indeed cause the observed canals .",
    "furthermore , from the rotation measures computed with the smoothed @xmath15 and @xmath16 values , we conclude that for the typical parameters of the discussed wsrt observations , beam depolarization is expected to add an error of about 15% to the computed rm .",
    "the rm distribution of the observed ring - like structure in polarized intensity suggests that the structure is not spherical but a pc - scale funnel - like structure or magnetic flux tube .",
    "numerical models show that sharp elongated gradients in rm , which can cause observed depolarization canals , can exist in the warm ism .",
    "beam depolarization gives an additional error of @xmath22  15% in rm in the wsrt 350  mhz observations discussed .",
