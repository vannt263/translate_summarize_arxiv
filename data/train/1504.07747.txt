    "luminous red novae ( lrne ) are a rare type of stellar transient typically more luminous than most novae , but fainter than supernovae ( sne ) , and characterized by a reddening color as they fade .",
    "the canonical system is v838 monocerotis , which produced an outburst in early 2002 , peaking at @xmath2 and later generating a spectacular light echo @xcite .",
    "the only extragalactic red transient with a similar peak magnitude is m31-rv @xcite .",
    "additionally , several other extragalactic transients show some similar properties to lrne , but are significantly more luminous at peak ( e.g. , m85  ot2006 - 1 , @xcite ; ptf  10fqs , @xcite ) , and often grouped as intermediate luminosity red transients ( ilrts ) .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain these events , including ( 1 )  a classical nova mechanism @xcite , ( 2 )  an unusual sn mechanism ( e.g.  @xcite ) , ( 3 ) giant planet capture @xcite , ( 4 )  stellar mergers @xcite and ( 5 )  extreme agb stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite , in a study of ilrts sn 2008s and ngc 300 ot2008 , suggested that lrne and ilrts may have different physical origins , favoring the extreme agb scenario as the likely mechanism for ilrts .",

    "master ot j004207.99 + 405501.1 ( hereafter m31lrn  2015 ) was discovered on 2015 january 13.63  ut by the master - kislovodsk auto - detection system at @xmath3 @xmath4 ( j2000 ) with an unfiltered magnitude of 19.0 @xcite .",
    "the transient then brightened significantly from @xmath5 on january 13.74 to @xmath6 on january 14.71 @xcite .",
    "a spectrum was taken by @xcite on 2015 january 14.8 , which revealed the presence of h@xmath1 emission , leading to the tentative classification of the transient as a classical nova in m31 .",
    "additional observations and analyses have been reported by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    as part of our extensive optical follow - up campaign for m31 novae",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) , we observed m31lrn  2015 photometrically and spectroscopically with the liverpool telescope ( lt ) , a fully robotic 2 m telescope on the island of la palma .",
    "we obtained multi - color photometric observations of m31lrn  2015 using the io : o ccd camera on the lt @xcite .",
    "typically @xmath7  s exposures were taken in each filter , which were decreased to @xmath8  s at later times as m31 became more difficult to observe .",
    "b _ , _ v _ and @xmath9-band photometric data were calibrated using eight stars from @xcite , with the @xmath9-band magnitudes computed using transformations from .",
    "the @xmath10-band data were calibrated using a single sdss dr9 @xcite star ( the only star in the field suitable for the calibration ) , j004225.86 + 405651.4 , which may have affected the reliability , but by comparison to the @xmath9-band photometry , we determined any systematic effect is small ( @xmath11  mag ) .",

    "our data imply optical peak was reached between 2015 january 19.89 and january 22.84 .",
    "m31 has a distance modulus of ( _ m@xmath47m_)@xmath48 @xcite .",
    "if we assume foreground reddening of @xmath49 @xcite and maximum total extinction at that position in m31 of @xmath50 , we conservatively assume that m31lrn  2015 was subject to reddening of @xmath51 .",
    "as such , the absolute peak magnitude of the transient was @xmath0 .",
    "it is possible that the peak magnitude was slightly brighter , although probably not significantly , given that the available photometric data in all filters seems to suggest a smooth transition from the rise to decline phases of the light curve .",
    "we obtained four spectra of m31lrn  2015 using the sprat spectrograph on the lt in red optimized mode , with a resolution of 18 , under photometric conditions .",
    "a spectrophotometric standard ( hiltner 600 ; @xcite ) was observed on the night of 2015 february 4 in @xmath52 seeing ( fwhm ) and used to flux calibrate the data .",
    "sprat has a fixed width slit equivalent to @xmath53 on the sky .",
    "seeing in the science spectra varies in the range @xmath54 ( fwhm ) between nights .",
    "this seeing variation forms the major cause of uncertainty in our absolute flux calibration , which we estimate as @xmath55 .",
    "however since all observations were obtained with the slit aligned with the parallactic angle , the relative flux calibration within a single spectrum is better constrained ( typically @xmath56 between 5000 and 7500  for all data ) .",
    "the first spectrum was obtained on 2015 january 16.86 , 3.2  days after discovery , and prior to peak .",
    "the only strong feature is the h@xmath1 emission , which has a fwhm of @xmath57kms@xmath58 and peaks at @xmath59 , consistent with an m31 origin .",
    "we derive a h@xmath1 flux of @xmath60erg@xmath61s@xmath58 from the best - fit gaussian profile",
    ". a small amount of na  i d absorption is detected ( fwhm = @xmath62kms@xmath58 ) , although this could be interstellar in origin , as well as h@xmath63 being tentatively identified .",
    "this , along with the other sprat spectra taken of m31lrn  2015 , is shown in figure  [ spec ] .",
    "the second spectrum was obtained 17  days later on february 2.86 . in this spectrum ,",
    "the h@xmath1 flux had weakened to @xmath64erg@xmath61s@xmath58 , the continuum is much redder , na  i d absorption is now strong and several other strong absorption features have emerged .",
    "the third spectrum , taken february 12.84 , is somewhat similar , but h@xmath1 is now only just visible above the continuum ( which is even redder ) .",
    "the most prominent absorption features in the second and third spectra are at @xmath65  ( na  i d ; fwhm = @xmath66kms@xmath58 ) , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . the @xmath69  absorption line ( fwhm = @xmath70kms@xmath58 ) is likely to be ba  ii ( 6496.9 ) blueshifted by @xmath71kms@xmath58 , making the more poorly constrained @xmath67  line consistent with ba  ii ( 6141.7 ) .",
    "there is also a less prominent absorption feature blue - ward of na  i d with a minimum at 5841.6 , but a profile could not be fit , which is possibly caused by ba  ii ( 5853.7 ) .",
    "the absorption at @xmath68 , may be caused by fe  ii , as seen ( along with ba  ii ) in the v838 mon spectra published by @xcite .",
    "we estimate the na  i d equivalent width ( ew ) as @xmath72  on january 16.86 and @xmath73  on february 12.84 . using the relation from @xcite , this gives a rough approximation of @xmath74 on january 16.86 and @xmath75 on february 12.84 .",
    "note however that those authors warn against using na  i d ew in low - resolution spectra to estimate absolute extinction , but it does at least show that the absorbing column may be increasing between the two epochs .",
    "the fourth spectrum was taken february 28.85 and showed significant changes , with the spectrum now somewhat resembling that of a k or m - type supergiant .",
    "no significant h@xmath1 emission is detected and there are clear tio absorption bands , with the ba  ii and na  i d lines still present .",
    "a spectrum was also taken on february 25.84 but is not included as it was very similar to the one taken february 28 , but noisier .",
    "having successfully recovered a number of progenitor systems for m31 novae , we used the same method to search for a possible progenitor system of m31lrn  2015 . the archival _",

    "i d : 10273 ) .",
    "three @xmath9-band lt frames taken on 2015 january 17.87 were stacked and 37 bright stars common to both observations were used to compute the geometric transformation between the two datasets using iraf @xcite routines . this transformation was used to determine the position of the quiescent m31lrn  2015 in the archival _ hst _ data .",
    "this analysis reveals a source within 1@xmath76 of the position of m31lrn  2015 in the _ hst _ data .",
    "photometry was performed on all sources using dolphot ( v2.0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the closest source to the calculated position of m31lrn  2015 , the progenitor candidate , is located at a distance of 0.55 acs / wfc pixels , 0.5@xmath76 or @xmath77 , and has magnitudes of f555w @xmath78 and f814w @xmath79 ( these are in agreement with a similar analysis by * ? ? ?",
    "we also note there is an additional source 1.4@xmath76 or @xmath80 away .",

    "using a similar method to that described in @xcite , we determine the probability of a source being within @xmath77 by chance is just @xmath82 , given the resolved local stellar density .     and",
    "3@xmath76 errors on the calculated position of the quiescent system are represented by green circles .",
    "the red crosses represent the positions of the nearby sources in the _ hst _ data.[prog ] ]    employing the conversions from @xcite and using the distance and reddening toward m31lrn  2015 in m31 ( see section  [ photobs ] ) we estimate the absolute magnitude of the progenitor candidate to be @xmath83 , @xmath84 with ( @xmath85)@xmath86 , consistent with a red giant .",
    "the local group galaxies survey ( lggs ; @xcite ) data reveal a nearby source , j004208.06 + 405501.7 , at @xmath87 , ( @xmath88 ) @xmath89 , ( @xmath90 ) @xmath91 and ( @xmath92 ) @xmath93 .",
    "while it would first appear that the progenitor is brighter in the @xcite catalog , an inspection of the images reveals this source is in fact a blend of several of the stars visible in figure  [ prog ] , including the two brightest .",
    "a source is clearly visible at the position of m31lrn  2015 in the lggs narrowband h@xmath1 data ( taken 2002",
    "september 11 ) , but nothing is seen at this position in either the [ o  iii ] or [ s  ii ] data . to remove any contribution from continuum emission in these narrowband images we subtracted the scaled lggs _",
    "r_-band image from both the h@xmath1 and [ s  ii ] images , and the scaled _",
    "v_-band image from the [ o  iii ] image .",
    "the scaling was calculated by determining a linear fit between the broadband and narrowband data using sextractor ( v2.19.5 ; ) photometry of @xmath94 objects in each image . a clear source was seen in the continuum - subtracted h@xmath1 data , indicating a strong h@xmath1 excess in the spectrum of the pre - outburst m31lrn  2015 .",
    "@xcite , who also used the lggs data , list it as an h  ii region ( # 1527 in their paper ) , with an estimated luminosity of @xmath95ergs@xmath58 .",
    "if indeed this is a star forming h  ii region , the luminosity implies a star formation rate of @xmath96  m@xmath97yr@xmath58 ( using the conversion from ) .",
    "a sn remnant origin for this emission seems unlikely , due to the lack of [ s  ii ] emission and the small size , which implies an age of less than a few hundred years .",
    "if this is not an h  ii region , the most likely source of the h@xmath1 emission is the progenitor system itself , either directly from the progenitor or a companion , or from a period of mass loss .",
    "m31lrn  2015 is a luminous , red transient in m31 , characterized by weakening h@xmath1 emission on an increasingly red continuum , with a number of absorption lines emerging after peak , including na  i d and ba  ii , and tio bands appearing at later times . considering the spectroscopic and photometric evolution of the outburst",
    "we conclude that this object is a lrn in m31 , a conclusion that @xcite reached independently from their data .",
    "we now compare the properties of this system to those of other proposed lrne and ilrts .",
    "the light curves of both lrne and ilrts are characterized by slow evolution ( compared to most novae ) and significant reddening as they fade .",
    "the light curves of lrne v1309 sco and v838 mon show the brightness quickly falling in the bluer filters , but plateauing in the red filters .",
    "the light curve of v4332 sagittarii ( another lrn ; @xcite ) also shows this object to be reddening about two weeks after discovery , although there is no color information for the earlier periods .",
    "the only lrn that shows clear evidence of a significant multiple - peak light curve structure is v838 mon .",
    "ilrts are more luminous at peak than the lrne discussed above and they also show different photometric evolution .",
    "the first ilrt discovered , m85  ot2006 - 1 , shows a long plateau phase ( @xmath98  days ) , with relatively little color evolution until later times @xcite .",
    "ilrt ptf  10fqs showed a plateau phase ( @xmath99  days ) , before rapidly reddening @xcite , and ngc 300 ot2008 also shows no major optical color evolution until later times @xcite .",
    "our observations show that m31lrn  2015 clearly resembles lrne , rather than ilrts , both in peak luminosity and light curve evolution . in the late - time m31lrn  2015 light curve ( see figure  [ lc ] ) , the @xmath9-band plateau appears to be ending , giving a plateau time of 40@xmath4750  days . comparing the plateau time and luminosity to the common - envelope event",
    "theoretical models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 1 ) , m31lrn  2015 is consistent with the model for a merger with ejecta mass of 0.1  m@xmath97 , but is also consistent with an event where the entire envelope is ejected .",
    "the spectra of lrne and ilrts do show similarities , with both types of object exhibiting strong na  i  d absorption and narrow h@xmath1 emission , but they also appear to show some differences .",
    "strong [ ca  ii ] emission has been seen in several ilrts ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which is not the case for lrne .",
    "additionally , strong tio absorption bands were seen at later times in lrne v4332 sgr @xcite and v838 mon ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these were also seen in m31-rv @xcite .",
    "v838 mon is the lrn with the best spectroscopic coverage , and the evolution of m31lrn  2015 seems to match that very well , for example , ba  ii ( 6496.9 ) appears between @xmath100  days prior to peak ( @xmath101  days ; on 2002 february 5 ) and @xmath102  days in v838 mon @xcite , and also appears in m31lrn  2015 after peak .",
    "it can be seen from figure  [ spec ] that our second and third spectra of m31lrn  2015 are remarkably similar to spectra taken around @xmath103  days of v838 mon published by @xcite , with our fourth spectrum of m31lrn  2015 similar to v838 mon at @xmath104  days .",
    "the only significant differences between m31lrn  2015 and v838 mon are the pre - outburst detections of the progenitor systems and the second bright peak in the light curve of the latter .",
    "the v838 mon system contains a young main - sequence binary companion @xcite . for the case of m31lrn  2015",
    ", we may again be seeing a binary companion , but at a more evolved stage , and depending on the mechanism , this may not represent different progenitor stars for the outbursts themselves .",
    "notably , no young stellar population similar to the locale of v838 mon was found to be coincident with m31-rv @xcite . if the giant planet capture mechanism was responsible for lrne outbursts , this system ( along with m31-rv ) would represent the first ( albeit indirect ) detection of extragalactic planetary systems .",
    "while the detected progenitor candidate does not exclude a classical nova mechanism @xcite for m31lrn  2015 , the presence of a high - mass main - sequence star in the v838 mon system and the strong evidence for a stellar merger in the case of v1309 sco appears to rule it out for those systems .",
    "the spectra are not consistent with a typical nova eruption , although @xcite offer an explanation for this .",
    "the strong evidence for the v1309 sco outburst being caused by the merger of a contact binary suggests that if a single progenitor mechanism is responsible for all lrne , this is likely to be the stellar merger scenario .",
    "@xcite reported possible pre - outburst variability in m31lrn 2015 from difference image analysis ( dia ) of archival data .",
    "although the presence of many faint sources in such crowded fields ( see section  [ sec : prog ] ) can affect the reliability of photometry , even when employing dia , it is unlikely in this case and the significant brightening they detect from @xmath105 to @xmath106 between 2009 and 2014 certainly warrants further investigation .",
    "in this letter we have presented photometric and spectroscopic observations of m31lrn  2015 , and a search for the progenitor system in broad and narrowband archival data . here",
    "we summarize the main conclusions",
    "we used the lt to photometrically and spectroscopically observe m31lrn  2015 , which is a lrn peaking at an absolute magnitude of @xmath0 .",
    "it took several days to reach optical peak , with the optical colors becoming increasingly redder over the following weeks .",
    "the spectra are characterized by a reddening continuum , weakening h@xmath1 emission and emerging absorption features , including na  i d and ba  ii . at later times",
    "tio absorption bands are also seen .",
    "m31lrn  2015 shows a number of similarities with the spectra of other transients classified as lrne , resembling v838 mon particularly closely .",
    "the likely progenitor system has an absolute magnitude of @xmath83 with ( @xmath85)@xmath86 , although this could represent photometry of a more luminous companion star .",
    "pre - outburst h@xmath1 emission is likely to be related to the progenitor system , either directly or the local environment .",
    "the nature of all of the lrn class of objects is still uncertain , but our observations of m31lrn  2015 and its likely progenitor system suggest that the mechanism(s ) must produce very similar outbursts ( in peak luminosity , timescale and outburst evolution ) , and possibly within differing stellar populations . if a single progenitor mechanism is responsible for all lrne , the balance of evidence favors the stellar merger pathway .",
