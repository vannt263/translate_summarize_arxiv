    "evaluation of electromagnetic @xmath4 transition helicity amplitudes ( @xmath5 electrocouplings ) from the data on @xmath0 electroproduction represents an important direction in the studies of @xmath5 structures with clas @xcite .",
    "the contributions from @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath0 exclusive channels account for almost 90% of the meson electroproduction cross section in the @xmath5 excitation region .",
    "these channels combined are sensitive to a major part of excited proton states .",
    "moreover , these exclusive channels are strongly coupled by hadronic interactions of the respective final states .",
    "therefore , nucleon resonance studies in single ( 1@xmath8 ) and charged double pion ( 2@xmath8 ) exclusive channels are of key importance for the entire @xmath5 physics .    in this proceeding",
    "we present recent developments in phenomenological studies of clas data @xcite on @xmath0 electroproduction off protons .",
    "the analysis was carried out in a wide area of invariant masses of the final hadronic system @xmath1 gev and photon virtualities @xmath2 @xmath3 with the ultimate objective of evaluating electrocouplings of almost all excited proton states with masses less than 1.8 gev from the fit of all available differential and fully integrated cross sections combined .",
    "the analysis presented in these proceedings incorporates differential and fully integrated @xmath0 cross sections of the recent clas data @xcite and previous data @xcite .",
    "these measurements cover a wide kinematical area of 1.3@xmath9w@xmath91.8 gev and 0.25@xmath9q@xmath10@xmath91.5 gev@xmath11 providing for the first time nine independent differential cross sections in each bin of @xmath12 and @xmath13 . both experimental data sets @xcite consist of @xmath14p , @xmath14@xmath15 , @xmath15p invariant masses ; @xmath15 @xmath14 p cm polar angular distributions and of three distributions over angles @xmath16 between two planes , respectively , composed by the momenta of the initial proton and final hadron ( first plane ) and two the other final hadrons ( a second plane ) with three possible combinations amongst these pairs .",
    "these data make it possible to establish all essential reaction mechanisms from the studies of their manifestations in observables , as peaks in invariant mass distributions or sharp slopes in angular distributions .",
    "the remaining mechanisms without pronounced kinematical dependencies can be established from the studies of correlations between shapes of their cross sections in various observables . employing this strategy",
    "the phenomenological meson - baryon model jm06 @xcite was developed with primary goal of determining @xmath5 electrocouplings from the combined fit of all nine differential cross sections .",
    "this model was initially utilized for the analysis of data @xcite in the kinematic area of 1.3@xmath9w@xmath91.56 gev and 0.25@xmath9q@xmath10@xmath90.6gev@xmath11 . in this kinematic region",
    "the jm06 model describes the @xmath17 production amplitude as a superposition of @xmath18 , @xmath19 isobar channels and direct double pion production mechanisms .",
    "the production amplitudes for @xmath20 intermediate states consist of resonant contributions @xmath21 , and non - resonant terms . all well established resonances with observed @xmath20 hadronic decays were incorporated into the jm06 model as well as a 3/2@xmath22(1720 ) candidate state @xcite .",
    "however , at 1.3@xmath9w@xmath91.56 gev only the contributions from @xmath23 and @xmath24 states were outside of the experimental data uncertainties .",
    "the non - resonant amplitudes were calculated from the well established born terms and presented in @xcite .",
    "additional contact terms were implemented in order to account for possible contributions from other mechanisms to @xmath20 production @xcite .",
    "the analysis of clas data @xcite allowed us to establish the contribution from direct charged double pion ( 2@xmath8 ) production mechanisms , when the @xmath25 final state is created without the formation of unstable hadrons in the intermediate states .",
    "the amplitudes for these processes , have been determined for the first time , are described in @xcite .",
    "recently the jm06 model was updated based on the analysis of the clas data @xcite collected in a wider kinematic area of 1.4@xmath9w@xmath91.8 gev and 0.5@xmath9@xmath13@xmath91.5 @xmath3 .",
    "the previous analysis of this data within the framework of the jm05 model version @xcite was limited to four differential cross sections : @xmath14p , @xmath14@xmath15 , @xmath15p invariant masses and @xmath15 angular distributions .",
    "the current analysis incorporates all nine differential cross sections mentioned above .",
    "the jm06 model production mechanisms , determined from the data @xcite at w@xmath91.56 gev , were extended by implementing quasi - two - body channels : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath26 isobar channel becomes visible in the data at @xmath30  gev with significant resonant contributions for @xmath31  gev .",
    "the production amplitudes for @xmath26 intermediate states consist of the resonant contributions @xmath32 , and non - resonant terms . here",
    "the non - resonant amplitudes are estimated by a diffractive ansatz , that has been modified in order to reproduce experimental data in the near and sub - threshold regions @xcite .",
    "the contributions from the @xmath33 and @xmath34 isobar channels are seen in the @xmath35 and @xmath36 mass distributions at @xmath37  gev ( fig .  [ 9sectok ] ) .",
    "the @xmath33 amplitudes are derived from the born terms of the @xmath20 isobar channels by implementing an additional @xmath38-matrix that accounts for the opposite parity of the @xmath24 with respect to the @xmath39 .",
    "the amplitudes of @xmath40 isobar channel are parametrized by lorentz invariant contractions of the initial and final particle spin - tensors and by effective propagators for the intermediate state particles .",
    "the magnitudes of these amplitudes are fitted to the data @xcite .    within the framework of the updated jm06 approach",
    ", we achieved a good description of the clas @xmath0 data over the entire kinematic range : 1.31@xmath9w@xmath91.8 gev and 0.25@xmath9@xmath41@xmath91.5 gev@xmath11 .",
    "as a typical example , the model description of the nine differential cross sections at @xmath42  gev and @xmath43  gev@xmath10 are presented in fig .",
    "[ 9sectok ] together with the contributing mechanisms .",
    "direct 2@xmath8 electroproduction mechanisms , that account for up to 30% of the cross sections at w@xmath9 1.56 gev @xcite , decreases with w and become negligible at w@xmath44 1.65 gev .",
    "the different mechanisms result in qualitatively different shapes of their respective contributions to various observables .",
    "the successful simultaneous description of all nine differential cross sections enables us to identify the essential contributing processes and to access their dynamics at the phenomenological level .",
    "the separation of resonant and non - resonant contributions based on the jm model parameters are shown in fig .",
    "[ 9secnstbck ] .",
    "resonant and non - resonant parts have qualitatively different shapes in all observables .",
    "this allows us to isolate the resonant contributions unambiguously .",
    "uncertainties for resonant and non - resonant parts of cross sections shown in fig .",
    "[ 9secnstbck ] are comparable with uncertainties of experimental data .",
    "good separation between resonant and non - resonant cross sections , achieved within the framework of the jm model , allowed us to extract the @xmath45 electrocouplings for several excited proton states with masses less than 1.8 gev .",
    "the clas data have enabled us for the first time to determine the @xmath23 , electrocouplings over a wide range of photon virtualities by analyzing the two major exclusive channels : 1@xmath8 and 2@xmath8 electroproduction @xcite . as an example , the electrocouplings of the @xmath23 state are shown in fig .",
    "[ p11 ] .",
    "the agreement of the results obtained from the analyses of 1@xmath8 and 2@xmath8 channels is highly significant since these meson electroproduction channels have completely different non - resonant amplitudes .",
    "the successful description of the large body of data on 1@xmath8 and 2@xmath8 electroproduction with almost the same values for the @xmath23 electrocouplings , shows the capability of the analysis methods developed for description of 1@xmath8 and 2@xmath8 electroproduction to provide a reliable evaluation of the resonance parameters .",
    "light cone quark models @xcite provided reasonable data description at @xmath41 @xmath44 2.0 gev@xmath11 and , therefore , strongly suggest that the quark core of @xmath23 state represents predominantly the first radial excitation of the three quark ground state nucleon . for the first time we observed the sign change in the q@xmath11 evolution of @xmath46 electrocoupling for @xmath23 state .",
    "this distinctive feature was predicted by light cone quark models , showing the essential role of light front effects in the structure of @xmath23 .",
    "however , the light cone model expectations @xcite and the data on @xmath46 electrocouplings of @xmath23 become considerably different at @xmath41@xmath91.0 gev@xmath11 .",
    "this discrepancy offers an indication that at distances of the order of the typical hadron size , not only quark core , but also others degrees of freedom as meson - baryon dressing may have substantial contribution to the resonance structure .",
    "extensive studies of meson - baryon dressing contributions to the structure of low lying @xmath5 are now in progress @xcite .",
    "the clas data on @xmath0 electroproduction @xcite allowed us for the first time to determine with a good accuracy electrocouplings of high lying resonances , that mostly decay to the @xmath47 final states .",
    "these data analysis was carried out within the framework of the updated jm model , outlined above .",
    "n@xmath48 hadronic couplings were taken from analyses of experiments with hadronic probes , presented in pdg . as it was shown in @xcite , with this choice of resonance hadronic couplings we need to account for the contributions from @xmath49 candidate state .",
    "electrocouplings of @xmath50 and @xmath51 states obtained from the analysis of the @xmath0 electroproduction data @xcite within the framework of the jm model are shown in fig .",
    "[ d33 ] and fig .",
    "[ p13 ] . for comparison the world data on electrocouplings of @xmath50 state , available before the clas @xmath0 electroproduction data , are shown by open circles .",
    "they were determined from the analysis of single pion electroproduction channels .",
    "the branching fraction to the @xmath52 final states for the @xmath50 decays is less than 20% .",
    "therefore , single pion electroproduction channels have not enough sensitivity to the electrocouplings of this state .",
    "this is the reason for huge uncertainties of the previous world data shown in fig .",
    "the studies of @xmath0 electroproduction provided first information on the electrocouplings of @xmath50 and @xmath51 states with reasonable accuracy .",
    "we observed a rapid fall - off of the @xmath46 electrocoupling of @xmath51 state with the photon virtuality q@xmath11 . at q@xmath11 above 0.9 gev@xmath11",
    "the absolute values of the helicity non - conserving @xmath53 electrocouplings become larger than the helicity conserving @xmath46 amplitude .",
    "search for the helicity conserving regime , expected at asymptotically high photon virtualities , represents an interesting open question for the future studies of this state at high photon virtualities .",
    "analysis of the clas data on the charged double pion electroproduction off protons @xcite within the framework of the jm model allowed us to establish all essential mechanisms contributing to this exclusive channel at 1.31@xmath9w@xmath91.8 gev and 0.25@xmath9@xmath41@xmath91.5 gev@xmath11 .",
    "a good description of nine differential cross sections in each bin of w and q@xmath11 was achieved , allowing us to isolate the resonant contributions to cross sections , needed for evaluation of @xmath5 electrocouplings .",
    "for the first time electrocouplings of several excited proton states with masses less than 1.8 gev were determined from the @xmath0 electroproduction channel .",
    "electrocouplings of @xmath23 state obtained from the analysis of two major single and charged double pion electroproduction channels with completely different non - resonant mechanisms are in a good agreement , showing the capability of the jm model to provide a reliable evaluation of the resonance parameters .",
