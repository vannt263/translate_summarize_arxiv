    "in a recent paper @xcite we reported on the calculation and analysis of low - temperature series for the square lattice spin-1 ising model . the series was derived to 79th order ( in the variable @xmath0)$ ] using the finite - lattice method @xcite and employed a new algorithm which removed much of the memory - size restrictions of previous implementations . in this paper",
    "we report on a further extension of these series to order 113 for the specific heat and spontaneous magnetisation and order 112 for the susceptibility .",
    "the extension is obtained by direct calculation of the series to order 99 and use of a new extrapolation procedure to extend the series by an additional 13 or 14 terms .",
    "the improvement in the direct series derivation is due to a more efficient implementation of the algorithm and the use of parallel computation .",
    "the extrapolation procedure is similar to and inspired by work on directed percolation @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian defining the spin-1 ising model in a magnetic field @xmath1 can be written : @xmath2 where the spin variable @xmath3 .",
    "the first sum is over nearest neighbour pairs and the second sum is over sites .",
    "the constants are chosen so the ground state ( @xmath4 ) has zero energy .",
    "the low temperature expansion is based on perturbations from the fully aligned ground state .",
    "the expansion is expressed in terms of the temperature variable @xmath5 and the field variable @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "the expansion of the partition function in powers of @xmath8 may be expressed as @xmath9 where @xmath10 are polynomials in @xmath11 .",
    "it is more convenient to express the field dependence in terms of the variable @xmath12 and truncate the expansion at @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a series in @xmath8 formed by collecting all terms in the expansion of @xmath16 containing factors of @xmath17 .",
    "standard definitions yield the spontaneous magnetisation    @xmath18    since @xmath19 in zero field .",
    "for the zero - field susceptibility we find @xmath20.\\ ] ]    the specific heat series is derived from the zero field partition function ( via the internal energy @xmath21 ) ,    @xmath22    so in order to obtain the series expansion of the specific heat , spontaneous magnetisation and susceptibility it suffices to calculate the three quantities @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    on the square lattice",
    "the infinite lattice partition function @xmath16 can be approximated by a product of partition functions @xmath26 on _ finite _ ( @xmath27 ) lattices , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a cut - off which limits the size of the rectangles considered .",
    "the weights @xmath30 are small integers and are known explicitly @xcite for the square lattice ,    @xmath31    due to the symmetry of the square lattice one obviously has that @xmath32 so one need only consider the case @xmath33 and change the weights @xmath30 appropriately , i.e. , multiply by 2 if @xmath34 .    for the low - temperature expansion of the ising model @xmath26 is calculated as the sum over all spin configurations on the finite lattice .",
    "all spins outside the @xmath35 range are fixed at @xmath36 .",
    "the number of terms derived correctly with the finite lattice method is given by the power of the lowest - order connected graph not contained in any of the rectangles considered , which in this case are chains of sites all in the ` 0 ' state . from the ising hamiltonian we see that such chains give rise to terms of order @xmath37 . for a given value of @xmath29",
    "the series expansion is thus correct to order @xmath38 .",
    "the efficient way of calculating @xmath26 is by transfer matrix techniques .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed description of the algorithm . for this work we used a more efficient implementation of the algorithm and a parallel computer and",
    "were able to derive the series directly up to a maximal cut - off @xmath39 .",
    "the series can be extended significantly via an extrapolation method similar to that of @xcite .",
    "consider the series for @xmath40 .",
    "for each @xmath41 we use the finite - lattice method to calculate the polynomials @xmath42 correct to @xmath43 . as already noted these polynomials agree with the series for @xmath44 to @xmath45 .",
    "next , we look at the sequences @xmath46 obtained from the difference between successive polynomials @xmath47 the first of these correction terms @xmath48 is often a simple sequence which one can readily identify . in the case of @xmath23",
    "we find the sequence @xmath49 from which we conjecture @xmath50 the formula for @xmath51 holds for all the @xmath52 values that we calculated and we are very confident that it is correct for all values of @xmath29 . as was the case in @xcite the higher - order correction terms @xmath53 can be expressed as rational functions of @xmath48 . due to the form of the first correction term this leads to the general extrapolation formulae @xmath54 the factors in front of the sums",
    "have been chosen so as to make the leading coefficients particularly simple .",
    "we were able to find formulae for all correction terms up to @xmath55 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 and up to @xmath56 for @xmath25 .",
    "the coefficients in the extrapolation formulae are listed in tables [ z0corr][z2corr ] .",
    "it is clear from equation that the @xmath57 terms available from the various sequences for the correction terms are not sufficient to determine all the @xmath58 unknown coefficients in the extrapolation formulae for large @xmath59 .",
    "however , from tables [ z0corr][z2corr ] we immediately see that the leading coeffients , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , in the extrapolation formulae are alternating in sign but otherwise constant , e.g. , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "in general we have found that the leading coeffients are expressible as polynomials in @xmath59 ,    @xmath64    and @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "the coefficients of these polynomials are listed in and .",

    "we analysed the series using the same methods as in our previous paper @xcite to which we refer the reader for details . here",
    "we will give only a short summary of the results including improved estimates for the critical point and amplitudes .",
    "the estimates @xmath112 for the physical singularity and @xmath113 for the critical exponent of the spontaneous magnetisation were obtained from homogeneous differential approximants ( which are equivalent to dlog pad approximants ) by averaging over @xmath114 $ ] approximants with @xmath115 using at least 100 series terms .",
    "the figure in parenthesis represents the spread among the approximants ( basically one standard deviation ) and should _ not _ be viewed as a measure of the true error as they can not include possible systematic sources of error . from these estimates",
    "it is clear that @xmath116 as expected .",
    "however , the estimates converge very slowly towards this value and even with a series as long as the present 114 terms the estimates have not yet settled down to their true value and there is a slight downwards drift in the estimates for both @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "analysis of the susceptibility and specific heat series yield exponent estimates fully in agreement with the expectations that @xmath119 and @xmath120 . by using our knowledge of the exact values of the critical exponents and assuming that close to @xmath117 the estimates for the exponents depend linearly on the estimates for the critical point ( inspection of the various approximants clearly supports this assumption )",
    "we are led to the improved estimate for the critical point @xmath121 .",
    "we calculated the critical amplitudes using two different methods , both of which are very simple and easy to implement .",
    "in the first method , we note that if @xmath122 , then it follows that @xmath123 .",
    "so we simply form the series for @xmath124 and evaluate pad approximants to this series at @xmath125 .",
    "the result is just @xmath126 .",
    "this procedure works well for the magnetisation and susceptibility series ( it obviously can not be used to analyse the specific heat series ) and yields the estimates @xmath127 and @xmath128 where the error bar primarily reflects the uncertainty due to the estimate of @xmath117 . for the specific heat series two different approaches have been used . in the first approach we look at the derivative of the specific heat series for which the above method should work with @xmath129 .",
    "this yields the estimate @xmath130 . in the second approach",
    "we start from @xmath131 and form the series @xmath132 which has a singularity at @xmath117 with exponent @xmath133 . one virtue of this approach is that no prior estimate of @xmath117 is needed .",
    "however , the spread among estimates from different approximants is quite substantial , though the amplitude estimate is consistent with that listed above . biasing the estimates at @xmath117 yields @xmath134 . in the second method , proposed by liu and fisher @xcite ,",
    "one starts from @xmath135 and then forms the auxiliary function @xmath136 .",
    "thus the required amplitude is now the _ background _ term in @xmath137 , which can be obtained from inhomogeneous differential approximants @xcite .",
    "this method can also be used to study the specific heat series .",
    "one now starts from @xmath138 and then looks at the auxiliary function @xmath139 . as before the amplitude can be obtained as the background term in @xmath137 .",
    "this analysis yields the amplitude estimates listed in . with the exception of the specific heat amplitude",
