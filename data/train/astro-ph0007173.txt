    "the local group compact elliptical galaxy m32 has long been recognized as an important stepping - stone for interpreting the stellar content of more distant galaxies .",
    "the structural characteristics of m32 appear to be related to massive classical ellipticals ( e.g. kormendy 1985 ) . nevertheless , m32 is also the closest example of a class of compact elliptical galaxies that are junior partners in hierarchal systems ( prugniel , nieto , & simien 1987 ) , suggesting that the high central concentration may be the result of tidal interactions ( e.g. faber 1973 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "nieto & prugniel ( 1987 ) find that the separation between m31 and m32 decays at a rate of @xmath11 kpc gyr@xmath12 . as a result ,",
    "the interactions between m31 and m32 were likely less intense in the past , and nieto & prugniel ( 1987 ) conclude that the structural characteristics and mass of m32 have not changed dramatically with time . while it is a matter of debate whether or not m32 and classical ellipticals share a common evolutionary heritage , it is clear that there is little hope of understanding the stellar contents of more distant galaxies if we can not understand the stellar content of a nearby , resolved system like m32 .",
    "m32 has been the target of numerous spectroscopic investigations , and these have detected signatures of a relatively blue main sequence turn - off ( oconnell 1980 , rose 1985 ) , and an extended asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) ( davidge 1990 ) , both of which are indicative of an intermediate - age population .",
    "m32 also has a very red ultraviolet / visible color when compared with other elliptical galaxies ( burstein et al .",
    "1988 ) , and this can be explained if a large intermediate age population is present ( e.g. ohl et al .",
    "1998 , yi et al . 1999 ) .    during the past decade",
    "there has been increased emphasis on studies of the resolved stellar content of m32 .",
    "imaging of the outer regions of m32 at visible wavelengths failed to detect an extended agb ( freedman 1989 , davidge & jones 1992 ; grillmair et al 1996 ) .",
    "this is not unexpected , as the visible light from highly evolved metal - rich giants is affected by line blanketing ( bica , barbuy , & ortolani 1991 ) , with the result that metal - rich agb - tip stars can be significantly fainter at visible wavelengths than less evolved metal - poor stars .",
    "the effects of line blanketing are greatly reduced at wavelengths longward of @xmath13 m ( e.g. davidge & simons 1994 ) , and infrared imaging surveys have discovered agb stars as bright as m@xmath14 in m32 ( freedman 1992 , elston & silva 1992 ) , which are much more luminous than agb stars in galactic globular clusters .    the outer regions of m32 contain stars spanning a range of metallicities ( freedman 1989 ; davidge & jones 1992 ) , with the peak of the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) occuring between [ fe / h ] =  0.2 and  0.3 ( grillmair et al .",
    "the mdf of m32 at intermediate radii can not be fit with a simple one - zone enrichment model ( grillmair et al .",
    "1996 ) , suggesting a complex chemical enrichment history , possibly like that proposed for the massive elliptical galaxy ngc 5128 by harris , harris , & poole ( 1999 ) .",
    "long slit spectra ( cohen 1979 , davidge , de robertis , & yee 1990 , davidge 1991 , hardy et al .",
    "1994 ) and the spatial distribution of resolved and unresolved uv sources ( brown et al . 1998 ) indicate that population gradients are present , with mean metallicity being one of the parameters that likely changes with radius .",
    "while the central regions of m32 contain strong - lined stars that originate from a very metal - rich component ( rose 1994 ) , only a modest population of uv - bright sources , which are thought to have evolved from the extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) of a very metal - rich population , have been detected in m32 , and brown et al .",
    "( 1998 ) conclude that the progenitors of these objects account for only 0.5% of all main sequence stars .    in the present study ,",
    "high angular resolution near - infrared images of two fields , sampling different regions of the galaxy , are used to investigate the evolved red stellar content of m32 .",
    "in addition to probing highly evolved stars , observations at infrared wavelengths also provide important information for decoupling the effects of age and metallicity in integrated light measurements ( davidge 1991 ) .",
    "finally , the contrast between the reddest , most evolved , stars and the unresolved , relatively blue , body of the galaxy is enhanced in the infrared with respect to the visible , making it easier to resolve evolved stars in crowded fields .",
    "the observations , the data reduction procedures , and the photometric measurements are discussed in  2 .",
    "the stellar contents of the two fields are investigated in  3 , and it is demonstrated that the density of the brightest agb stars scales with surface brightness at distances in excess of a few arcsec from the nucleus , indicating that the relative size of the intermediate age component measured with respect to the rest of the galaxy is constant over a large range of radii . however , within 1 arcsec of the nucleus the integrated near - infrared broad - band colors and the @xmath10 m co index vary with radius .",
    "a brief summary and discussion of the results follows in  4 .",
    "the data were recorded with the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) adaptive optics bonnette ( aob ) and kir imager on the nights of ut september 6 and 7 , 1998 .",
    "the aob has been described by rigaut et al .",
    "the detector in kir is a @xmath15 hg : cd : te array with 0.034 arcsec pixels , so that the imaged field is @xmath16 arcsec .",
    "a field that included the nucleus of m32 ( the ` inner ' field ) was observed through @xmath17 m continuum , and @xmath10 m co filters .",
    "the galaxy nucleus , which was used as the reference source for ao compensation , was offset 10 arcsec from the field center so that the minor axis of m32 could be sampled out to a distance of 40 arcsec .",
    "a complete observing sequence for each filter consisted of 5 co - added exposures recorded at 4 dither positions , which were offset in a @xmath18 arcsec square pattern .",
    "the total exposure times were 1200 sec in each of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , 1800 sec in the @xmath21 m continuum filter , and 2400 sec in co. the seeing conditions were mediochre when these data were recorded , and the delivered image quality is 0.4 arcsec fwhm .",
    "deep @xmath19 and @xmath20 images , with 1200 sec total exposure times per filter , were also recorded of a field 2.3 arcmin from the nucleus ( the ` outer ' field ) centered on the star gsc 02801  02082 , which was used as the reference source for ao compensation .",
    "this field is slightly offset from the minor axis of the galaxy , and the data were recorded using the observing sequence described for the inner field .",
    "the seeing conditions were very good , and the delivered image quality is 0.20 arcsec fwhm in @xmath22 and 0.15 arcsec in @xmath23 and @xmath20 .",
    "the data were reduced using the procedure described by davidge & courteau ( 1999 ) , which consists of the following steps : ( 1 ) subtraction of dark frames , ( 2 ) division by dome flats , ( 3 ) subtraction of a dc sky level from each image , and ( 4 ) subtraction of fringe and thermal emission patterns , using calibration frames that were constructed from blank sky fields .",
    "the images for each field were then aligned and median - combined on a filter - by - filter basis .",
    "the final @xmath20 images of these fields are shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "stellar brightnesses were measured with the psf - fitting program allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) , using psfs and target lists generated with daophot ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "a single psf was constructed for each field @xmath24 filter combination .",
    "the use of a single reference star for ao - compensation produces a variable psf ( ` anisoplanaticism ' ) , and this is a source of photometric errors if a single psf is adopted for the entire field .",
    "however , studies of globular clusters conducted with the cfht aob demonstrate that the photometric uncertainties introduced by psf variations amount to only a few percent over the kir field ( davidge & courteau 1999 ; davidge 2000a ) , and an examination of the psf - fitting residuals in the inner and outer field m32 data indicate that psf variations do not introduce uncertainties of more than a few percent . the modest scatter in the m32 outer field cmds (",
    " 3 ) is further evidence that psf variations do not seriously affect the current photometry .",
    "the photometric calibration was defined using standard stars from casali & hawarden ( 1992 ) and elias et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , which were observed throughout the 3 night run .",
    "the unresolved body of m32 creates a non - uniform background in the inner field that complicates efforts to measure stellar brightness , and this was removed using the iterative procedure described by davidge , le fevre , & clark ( 1991 ) .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath26 cmds of the m32 outer field are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the rgb and upper portions of the agb are clearly evident in these data : the onset of the former causes a slight broadening in the color distribution when @xmath27 , while the latter extends from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , and has a scatter of @xmath30 mag in @xmath31 and @xmath9 .",
    "there is also a 0.2 mag gap in the cmds near @xmath32 .",
    "data from table 1 of freedman ( 1992 ) are compared with the current observations in the right hand panel of figure 3 .",
    "freedman observed an area four times larger than the aob field , and so it is not surprising that she detected sources that are brighter than those in the present dataset .",
    "the cmds constructed from the aob data have less scatter than the freedman observations , and extend @xmath33 mag fainter in @xmath6 .",
    "the ridgeline of the freedman observations , which can be traced by identifying the colors with the highest concentration of data points , is located near the left hand side of her data distribution and matches the locus of the aob data .",
    "a gap in the cmd immediately above the rgb - tip is also evident in the freedman data .",
    "freedman suggested that the objects in her dataset with @xmath34 are carbon stars .",
    "stars with this color are not seen in the current dataset , even though a significant number would have been expected based on the freedman observations .",
    "while stars with @xmath34 are present in the elston & silva ( 1992 ) @xmath26 cmd , the relative number of these objects with respect to bluer stars is much smaller than in the freedman ( 1992 ) dataset .",
    "freedman ( 1992 ) notes that some stars in her study have large photometric uncertainties , which may be as great as 0.5 mag in @xmath35 and 0.2 mag in @xmath31 .",
    "we speculate that the reddest stars in her sample are objects with large photometric errors .",
    "the @xmath6 lf of the outer field is plotted in figure 4 .",
    "artificial star experiments indicate that incompleteness and photometric errors become significant when @xmath36 , and so only data brighter than this are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the dashed line shows a power - law that was fit to the lf between @xmath37 and @xmath38 using the method of least squares .",
    "the fitted power - law has an exponent @xmath39 , which is near the low end of what is seen in the galactic bulge ( e.g. davidge 2000b ) .",
    "when @xmath40 the lf consistently falls below the extrapolated power - law fit , indicating that the rgb - tip produces a significant discontinuity in the @xmath6 lf , even though models predict that the brightness of the rgb - tip is sensitive to age and metallicity near @xmath41 m ( see below ) .",
    "the bolometric lf of stars in the outer field , calculated using the bolometric corrections for field giants shown in figure 1b of frogel & whitford ( 1987 ) , is plotted in figure 5 .",
    "a distance modulus of @xmath42 has been adopted , based on an rgb - tip brightness of @xmath43 for m32 ( davidge & jones 1992 ) , which is 0.1 mag brighter than that in m31 ( davidge 1993 ) , for which @xmath44 ( van den bergh 2000 ) .",
    "the data have also been corrected for a foreground reddening of e(b  v ) = 0.08 ( burstein & heiles 1984 ) .",
    "the most luminous stars in the m32 outer field have m@xmath45 , which is comparable to what is seen in baade s window ( e.g. frogel & whitford 1987 ) .",
    "the dashed line in figure 5 is the lf of inner bulge giants measured by davidge ( 1998 ) , which has been scaled to match the number of stars in the m32 field with m@xmath46 .",
    "there is excellent agreement between the bulge and m32 lfs .",
    "the brightnesses of the agb - tip and rgb - tip from the z = 0.001 ( [ m / h ] = 1.2 ) , z = 0.004 ( [ m / h ] = 0.6 ) , and z = 0.020 ( [ m / h ] = 0.1 ) bertelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ) models are compared with the observations in figure 6 .",
    "m@xmath47 was computed from the m@xmath48 and @xmath49 entries in tables 8 , 9 , and 11 of bertelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , while @xmath9 colors were calculated using the field giant color relations listed in table 3 of bessell & brett ( 1988 ) .",
    "the model sequences in figure 6 consistently fall to the right of the outer field observations , although the significance of this result is low due to uncertainties in , for example , the mixing length and the adopted relation between @xmath49 and @xmath9 .",
    "if the distance to m32 has been overestimated then the agreement along the color axis will improve slightly . while there are uncertainties in the color calibration , the relative model - to - model color variations are likely reliable , and the scatter on the upper agb is consistent with a dispersion of @xmath50 dex in [ m / h ] or @xmath51 dex in age .",
    "comparisons between models and observations that are based on brightness are more reliable than those that rely on color .",
    "the inner field observations suggest that the agb - tip occurs near @xmath8 in m32 (  3.2 ) , which is consistent with the brightest stars detected in the freedman ( 1992 ) and elston & silva ( 1992 ) datasets , and corresponds to m@xmath52 if @xmath53 .",
    "it is evident from figure 6 that models with log(t@xmath54 ) @xmath55 are required to match the agb - tip brightness .",
    "caution should be exercised when attempting to derive absolute ages from a highly evolved state such as the agb - tip , and the age limits inferred from figure 6 are uncomfortably close to those defined by the visible spectrum of m32 , which indicate that the galaxy does not contain a large population with log(t@xmath54 ) @xmath56 ( bica et al .",
    "1990 ) .      in this section the stellar content in the inner m32 field is compared with that in the outer field .",
    "mean age and/or metallicity may change rapidly with radius near the center of m32 , and so the inner field was divided into three regions , sampling distinct stellar density regimes centered on the nucleus .",
    "the radial limits and the mean surface brightnesses of these regions are listed in table 1 .",
    "the effects of crowding in region 1 are extreme , and the stellar content in this area will be investigated using integrated colors in  3.3 .",
    "the @xmath6 lfs of regions 2 and 3 are shown in figure 7 .",
    "the lower stellar density in region 3 means that the brightness in @xmath6 where incompleteness becomes significant , estimated from the point at which number counts in the lfs decline , is 0.5  1.0 mag fainter in region 3 than in region 2 .",
    "many of the sources detected in regions 2 and 3 are not individual stars , but blends of two or more moderately faint objects .",
    "the effects of blending become less severe with increasing brightness , and the densities of stars with @xmath29 are sufficiently low that the sources with @xmath8 in regions 2 and 3 are likely individual stars .",
    "this can be checked by comparing the densities of @xmath8 stars in the freedman ( 1992 ) and elston & silva ( 1992 ) datasets with those in region 2 and 3 after correcting for differences in surface brightness .",
    "the observed densities of @xmath8 stars in the inner field are @xmath57 per square arcmin ( region 2 ) and @xmath58 per square arcmin ( region 3 ) .",
    "freedman ( 1992 ) detected 4 stars with @xmath6 between 15.75 and 15.25 in a 1.11 square arcmin area 2 arcmin south of the m32 nucleus , where the surface brightness is @xmath59 mag per square arcmin ( kent 1987 ) .",
    "if the spatial distribution of @xmath8 stars follows the integrated light profile of the galaxy then the densities of these objects in the circumnuclear region should be @xmath60 per square arcmin ( region 2 ) and @xmath61 per square arcmin ( region 3 ) .",
    "elston & silva ( 1992 ) detected 10 stars with @xmath6 between 15.25 and 15.75 in a 16 square arcmin field 3 arcmin east of the nucleus , where the surface brightness is @xmath62 mag per square arcmin .",
    "the densities of @xmath8 stars predicted from these data is @xmath63 per square arcmin ( region 2 ) and @xmath64 per square arcmin ( region 3 ) .",
    "the bright star densities predicted for regions 2 and 3 from the freedman and elston & silva studies agree within the estimated uncertainties , and the unweighted means are @xmath65 ( region 2 ) and @xmath66 ( regions 3 ) .",
    "thus , the observed densities of bright red stars in regions 2 and 3 differ from the densities inferred from the outer regions of m32 at less than the @xmath67 level .",
    "the calculations described above indicate that the the brightest red stars have a spatial distribution that follows the surface brightness profile of the galaxy to within a few arcsec of the nucleus .",
    "these comparisons can be extended to fainter stars by scaling the outer field lf to match the surface brightnesses in regions 2 and 3 .",
    "the effects of crowding are significant among all but the brightest sources in regions 2 and 3 , and statistical crowding corrections appropriate for each region were applied to the outer field lf after calculating the probability that two stars in a given brightness interval occur in the same resolution element , the diameter of which equals the fwhm of the psf , and thus produce a blended image that would be counted in the next brightest lf bin .    the outer field lf , scaled and corrected for crowding based on the stellar densities in regions 2 and 3 , is shown as a dashed line in figure 7 . while the agreement with the region 3 lf is excellent when @xmath68 , the comparison with the region 2 lf is inconclusive , as incompleteness becomes significant in region 2 when @xmath69 .",
    "the data thus indicate that at distances in excess of 20 arcsec from the center of m32 , which is the inner radius of region 3 , the evolved red stellar content scales with @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the intermediate - age population is not more centrally concentrated than other populations at distances in excess of 20 arcsec from the nucleus . while the density of @xmath71 stars suggests that this may also be the case for radii as small as 5 arcsec , which is the inner radius of region 2 , this",
    "can not be verified with fainter stars until data with better image quality are obtained .",
    "although m32 contains a metallicity gradient ( e.g. hardy et al .",
    "1994 ) , this will not have a major impact on the comparisons discussed above , as the radial changes in mean metallicity are modest .",
    "if @xmath1mg@xmath72/@xmath1log(r ) = @xmath73 and @xmath74log(r ) = @xmath75 ( hardy et al . 1994 ) , then the difference in indices between the outer field and region 3 ( @xmath1log(r ) = 0.7 ) is @xmath1mg@xmath76 and @xmath77 , while between the outer field and region 2 ( @xmath1log(r ) = 1.0 ) @xmath1mg@xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "these correspond to @xmath1[fe / h ] = 0.1 dex ( region 3 ) and @xmath1[fe / h ] = 0.2 dex ( region 2 ) with respect to the outer field according to the solar metallicity models of worthey ( 1994 ) .",
    "the radial behaviour of @xmath35 , @xmath9 and co near the center of m32 is investigated in figure 8 , where radial averages of these quantities in 0.4 arcsec annuli are plotted .",
    "@xmath9 becomes bluer when @xmath80 arcsec , while the co index becomes larger .",
    "given that @xmath35 does not change markedly with radius , it appears that the color gradients are driven primarily by changes in the spectral - energy distribution ( sed ) at wavelengths longward of @xmath81 m .",
    "the colors in figure 8 are insensitive to uncertainties in sky brightness , which was measured in the upper left hand corner of figure 2 , because they are restricted to the high surface brightness central regions of the galaxy .",
    "peletier ( 1993 ) used images with an angular resolution of 1.5 arcsec fwhm to investigate near - infrared color gradients in m32 .",
    "the data in table 2 of peletier ( 1993 ) indicate that within the central few arcsec of m32 there is a clear tendency for @xmath9 to weaken with decreasing radius , and for co to strengthen , in qualtitative agreement with the trends in figure 8 .",
    "several studies have measured the visible and uv colors near the center of m32 .",
    "michard & nieto ( 1991 ) examined data with 0.7  0.9 arcsec resolution and concluded that @xmath82 and @xmath83 do not vary with radius near the nucleus of m32 .",
    "however , the measurements listed in table 2 of peletier ( 1993 ) , indicate that @xmath84 and @xmath82 may redden towards smaller radii .",
    "lauer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) examined images recorded with wfpc2 and concluded that @xmath85 does not change with radius , while @xmath86 may redden with decreasing radius .",
    "ohl et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find that the color of m32 in the far - ultraviolet becomes significantly redder towards smaller radii , although this trend is defined with measurements at distances in excess of 2 arcsec from the center , and so may not be related to changes in stellar content near the nucleus .",
    "the published data indicate that visible and near - infrared colors do not change dramatically with radius in m32 when @xmath87 arcsec , and none of the studies detect a central bluing in the uv and visible portions of the spectrum .",
    "when combined with the results in figure 8 , the published data suggest that the sed of m32 undergoes complex changes close to the nucleus , becoming bluer with decreasing radius longward of 2@xmath88 m , not changing with radius at visible wavelengths , and possibly becoming redder with decreasing radius shortward of @xmath89 m .",
    "the @xmath90 and @xmath91 diagrams , shown in figure 9 , provide a means of probing the sed near the nucleus of m32 .",
    "when @xmath92 arcsec the near - infrared sed is similar to that of star clusters in the magellanic clouds .",
    "however , at smaller radii the m32 data depart from a sed appropriate for star clusters , in the sense that while @xmath35 remains at a value appropriate for stellar systems , @xmath31 decreases by more than 0.1 mag .",
    "when @xmath80 arcsec @xmath9 decreases towards smaller radii , while the co index increases .    the large nuclear co index of m32 is not easily explained",
    "mobasher & james ( 1996 ) , and james & mobasher ( 1999 ) measured the strength of @xmath10 m co absorption in a moderately large number of elliptical galaxies .",
    "these data were recorded through 2.4 arcsec wide slits , and hence are not dominated by light from the galaxy nuclei ; nevertheless , these data still provide insight into the co index of composite metal - rich systems . after transforming the spectroscopic co measurements into the photometric co system using the relation defined by doyon , joseph , & wright ( 1994 ) ,",
    "it is concluded that co@xmath93 , compared with co = 0.36 near the nucleus of m32 .",
    "the only other stellar system having a published co index with a spatial resolution comparable to the m32 observations is the galactic center , which would have co = 0.26 if viewed at a distance of 1 mpc ( davidge 2000c ) .",
    "luminous red giants in the vicinity of sgra and red supergiants in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds have co indices comparable to the nucleus of m32 ( elias et al .",
    "1985 , kenyon 1988 , davidge 1998 ) .",
    "however , these stars have @xmath94 , and hence do not provide suitable templates for the nucleus of m32 .",
    "therefore , it appears that the near - infrared sed of the m32 nucleus differs from that of benchmark systems such as nearby bright giants , star clusters , and the central few arcsec of elliptical galaxies .",
    "near - infrared images have been used to investigate the stellar content of the local group compact elliptical galaxy m32 .",
    "agb stars as bright as @xmath8 , which were detected in earlier infrared studies of the outer regions of the galaxy , are also found near the center of the galaxy .",
    "the number density of these objects increases towards smaller radii , indicating that they are actual members of m32 , and not luminous agb stars in the outer disk of m31 .",
    "hence , these data confirm the presence of the intermediate - age population predicted by spectroscopic investigations .",
    "the bright agb stars in the outer regions of m32 have @xmath4 , and it is suggested that the very red objects detected by freedman ( 1992 ) have large photometric errors .",
    "the @xmath6 lf of the brightest agb stars scales with integrated surface brightness to within 20 arcsec of the galaxy center , suggesting that the relative frequency of bright agb stars , as measured with respect to fainter stars , does not change over most of the galaxy .",
    "this does not rule out the presence of a subtle ( @xmath95 gyr ) age gradient in m32 , since the brightness of the agb - tip changes slowly with age in all but the youngest intermediate - age populations .",
    "the uv portion of the spectrum is very age - sensitive during intermediate epochs ( yi et al .",
    "1999 ) , and an age gradient , in the sense that younger stars occur at smaller radii , provides one explanation for the uv color of m32 increasing with decreasing radius ( oconnell et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the data presented in this paper indicate that the near - infrared sed changes within a few tenths of an arcsec of the center of m32 , and that the center of the galaxy has colors that differ from those of star clusters and the main bodies of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the central properties of m32 are peculiar in other ways .",
    "for example , the ratio of central x - ray flux to mass is the smallest of any known super - massive black hole , suggesting that the central object may be fuel - starved , or is not an efficient accretor ( loewenstein et al .",
    "in addition , the gravitational field from the central object influences the central arcsec of m32 ( van der marel 1999 ) , so variations in stellar content and/or morphology might be expected to occur in this area . however , the core of m32 lacks conspicuous structure at uv ( cole et al .",
    "1998 ) and visible ( lauer et al . 1998 ) wavelengths .",
    "m32 also lacks a centrally concentrated blue population , and this is puzzling since stellar interactions in the dense nuclear regions might be expected to produce a large number of blue stragglers ( lauer et al .",
    "the changes in near - infrared photometric properties detected in the current study occur on an angular scale that is comparable to the region influenced by the central black hole ( van der marel 1999 ) , suggesting a possible connection .",
    "the ` stubborn refusal of m32 to reveal any departures from utter normalacy at small radii ' noted by lauer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) appears to break down when data spanning a broader range of wavelengths are considered .",
    "the relative size of the intermediate - age population with respect to the rest of the galaxy can be estimated from the integrated brightness of agb stars brighter than the rgb - tip .",
    "the integrated brightness of the outer field based on the kent ( 1987 ) surface brightness profile , assuming that @xmath96 for a typical spheroidal galaxy ( kent 1987 ) and that @xmath97 for m32 ( frogel et al . 1978 ) , is @xmath98 . for comparison ,",
    "the integrated brightness of stars on the upper agb is @xmath99 , so luminous agb stars contribute 20% of the total light from the outer field in @xmath6 .",

    "the ratio of light in @xmath6 from bright agb stars to that of the entire cluster is a well - defined quantity among these objects , with a mean value @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , if the intermediate age component in the m32 outer field has an age of a few gyr then this population accounts for roughly 25% of the total light in @xmath6 .",
    "the m / l ratio in @xmath6 of an intermediate age population that has a salpeter imf and an age of a few gyr is one - half to one - third that of an old population ( buzzoni 1989 ) . if the main body of m32 is relatively old , then the intermediate - age population in the outer field thus accounts for roughly 10% of the total mass , with an estimated uncertainty @xmath101 . for comparison , bica et al .",
    "( 1990 ) predict that the central regions of m32 contain an intermediate - age population that accounts for 15% of the mass .",
    "the good agreement between these two mass estimates , obtained using very different techniques in different parts of the galaxy , is further evidence that the intermediate - age population in m32 is uniformly distributed throughout the galaxy , as expected based on the comparisons in  3.2 .",
    "the presence of an intermediate age population accounting for 10% of the galaxy mass indicates that m32 had a significant ism a few gyr in the past . what was the source of the gas from which these stars formed ?",
    "m31 is a nearby reservoir of star - forming material , and there are signs that m32 has interacted recently ( cepa & beckman 1988 ) with material in the disk of this galaxy ( byrd 1976 , 1978 ; sofue & kato 1981 ) .",
    "however , if m32 was able to cull large amounts of gas from m31 during intermediate epochs then it must have been a special event , as subsequent passages through the disk of m31 have not produced noticeable bursts of star formation .",
    "mass ejected from evolved stars is another source of an ism .",
    "sage , welch , & mitchell ( 1998 ) estimate that stellar mass loss should have produced an ism in m32 with mass @xmath102 m@xmath103 since the last interaction with m31 .",
    "this is consistent with the mass of hi within the central 3 square arcmin , which emerson ( 1974 ) measures to be @xmath104 m@xmath103 .",
    "however , based on the non - detection of co 1 - 0 emission from m32 , sage et al . ( 1998 ) conclude that the mass of h@xmath72 is @xmath105 m@xmath103 within the central 160 pc of the galaxy .",
    "the mean separation between m32 and m31 was significantly greater in the past ( nieto & prugniel 1987 ) , and m32 could have built up a larger ism from stellar mass loss during earlier epochs due to decreased tidal interactions with m31 . if the bright agb stars formed from gas that originated in m32 then these objects should be among the most metal - rich in the galaxy , with metallicities within a factor of 2 of solar according to the grillmair et al .",
    "( 1996 ) mdf .",
    "high - quality visible and near - infrared spectra can be obtained of the brightest agb stars using instruments on 4 or 8 metre telescopes , thereby providing a direct means of measuring the metallicities of these objects .",
    "if the agb stars are found to be relatively metal - poor then a source of gas external to m32 would seem likely ; for example , if star formation in m32 during intermediate epochs was fueled by the accretion of the high velocity clouds that have been interpreted as the remnants of the material from which the local group formed , then the agb stars would have [ fe / h ] @xmath106 ( blitz et al ."
