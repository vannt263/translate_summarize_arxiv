    "in order to make realistic predictions for @xmath10 at the linear collider ( lc ) , one needs to understand the role played by qcd in the energy dependence of total cross - sections .",
    "this will allow to reduce the large errors coming from the present large uncertainties in the @xmath11 and which affect present predictions at the lc .",
    "it must be noticed that presently all total cross - sections exhibit the same general features , namely an initial decrease followed by a more or less gentle rise@xcite , as shown in fig.([fig : allfig1 ] ) .",
    "we however lack a complete theoretical model and while we might be able to do a good parametrization of the proton - proton data , we do not know how to gauge the inherent theoretical uncertainties .",
    "this results in further uncertainties in the photoproduction cross - section and in an even larger uncertainty in predictions at lc .",
    "thus we should study in detail the cross - talk between future measurements of total proton - proton cross - section at the lhc and a similar hera measurement , to develop and fully understand what to expect at lc in terms of the hadronic background .",
    "the curve shown in fig.([fig : allfig1 ] ) is obtained by embedding the qcd mini - jet cross - section in an eikonal formulation @xcite @xmath12 \\label{stot}\\ ] ] where we put @xmath13 , and @xmath14 in this eikonal minijet model ( emm ) , the rise is driven by the jet cross - section , which is calculated using current parton densities down to a minimum jet transverse momentum , @xmath15 .",
    "the impact parameter distribution is the ( normalized to unity ) fourier transform of the initial transverse momentum of the colliding partons , in leading order the valence quarks , obtained through the bloch nordsieck soft gluon summation@xcite .",
    "this model can also be applied to the photo - production and @xmath16 data .",
    "the results , for a set of @xmath17 values , are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : gggpfig2 ] ) , with cjkl @xcite parton densities .",
    "the emm model with soft gluons has the virtue of reproducing the gentle rise with energy which characterizes the proton - proton data and is also compatible with the photon data .",
    "this is not true for other models , as we show in fig.([fig : gggpfig3 ] ) , where a fit @xcite of the @xmath18 data with a regge - pomeron type parametrization , indicates a harder rise with energy than what is present in the proton - proton data .",
    "we also show the photoproduction data and compare it with the ( i ) emm model without soft gluons @xcite and with the ( ii ) aspen model  @xcite .",
    "present tevatron data for total cross - section lead to uncertainties when extrapolated to the lhc energies .",
    "such uncertainties are also found in predictions for lc hadronic cross - sections which suffer from uncertainties in the @xmath19 cross - sections .",
    "we have emphasized that to obtain realistic estimates for the hadronic background at lc , we need combined model predictions for lhc as well as the hera data . an example has been provided through our soft gluon formula for the purely hadronic as well as the @xmath19 data .",
