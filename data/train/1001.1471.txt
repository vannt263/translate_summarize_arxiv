    "after allowing for the accurate determination of the pulsar spin - down , pulse arrival - time measurements display two types of irregularities in the pulsar rotation rate : timing noise and glitches .",
    "timing noise is a continuous wandering of the pulsar rotation rate , on time - scales of days , months and years . in most young pulsars ,",
    "timing noise is generally very `` red '' , i.e. , stronger at lower frequencies @xcite , and the second time - derivative of the pulse frequency is commonly used as an indicator of the level of noise .",
    "glitches are characterized by a sudden increase in the pulsar rotation rate , often followed by a ( partial ) recovery toward the pre - glitch status .",
    "glitches were first observed in the vela pulsar @xcite and it was soon realized that they could be an important diagnostic for studying neutron - star interiors @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed that these events are caused by either sudden and irregular transfer of angular momentum from a faster rotating interior super - fluid to the solid crust of the neutron star , or quakes in a solid component of the star , or even both .",
    "the result is a sudden increase in the rotational frequency @xmath3 of the pulsar with a relative magnitude normally in the range @xmath8 .",
    "large glitches ( @xmath9 ) are usually accompanied by jumps in the spin - down rate ( @xmath10 to @xmath11 ) .",
    "a characteristic feature of many glitches is a relaxation after the frequency jump , which may occur over periods of minutes to years . in some cases ,",
    "this relaxation is approximately exponential toward the extrapolated pre - glitch state , but many different forms of relaxation are observed , some with multiple timescales .",
    "@xcite presented evidence that the degree of relaxation in different pulsars is related to their spin - down rate @xmath4 .",
    "although glitches are a rather rare phenomena , an increasing number of these events have been reported @xcite , permitting more comprehensive statistical studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to date about 170 glitches have been observed , in 51 of the over 1800 known pulsars .",
    "the most frequent glitches have been detected in psrs b0531 + 21 ( crab ) , j0537@xmath26910 , b0833@xmath245 ( vela ) , j1341@xmath26220 and b1737@xmath230 , which have characteristic ages in the range @xmath12 to @xmath13   yr .",
    "psr j0537@xmath26910 has glitched 23 times in seven years , with most of the glitches being relatively small in @xmath14 terms ( typically a few parts in @xmath15 ) .",
    "their amplitude shows a strong correlation with the interval to the following glitch @xcite .",
    "glitches in the crab pulsar are even smaller , with @xmath14 typically @xmath16 @xcite . there is normally a rapid exponential decay over several days and a persistent increase in slow - down rate @xcite .",
    "the vela pulsar is the prototypical pulsar showing large glitches , with @xmath14 generally @xmath17 although some small and intermediate - sized glitches have been observed .",
    "the post - glitch decay is initially exponential , with evidence for several timescales ranging from 1 minute to several hundred days , but subsequently linear till the next glitch @xcite .",
    "psr b1737@xmath230 is a frequently glitching pulsar which shows a large range of glitch sizes and a high value of the glitch activity parameter @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total data span @xcite .",
    "significant post - glitch decays are observed for the larger glitches .    clearly , the glitch phenomenon in pulsars is complex .",
    "further observations of a larger sample of pulsars will help to quantify and understand processes responsible for the very different glitch and post - glitch behaviours observed both between different pulsars and in different glitches in the same pulsar .",
    "nearly 280 pulsars are being monitored regularly at urumqi observatory in a timing program which commenced in 2000 .",
    "the aims of the project are to make precise measurements of the position and timing behaviour of pulsars , to provide ephemeris for observations at radio and other wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and to investigate the interiors of neutron stars by monitoring irregularities in their rotation behaviour . in this paper",
    "we describe the glitches detected in our observations , together with updated descriptions of the relaxations for some previously reported glitches .",
    "timing observations of pulsars using the urumqi observatory 25-m radio telescope at nanshan started in 2000 january with a dual - channel room - temperature receiver .",
    "a dual - channel cryogenic receiver system has been used at the central observing frequency of 1540 mhz since 2002 july .",
    "approximately 280 pulsars are observed regularly three times each month and results to 2008 december are reported here .",
    "the two polarizations , each of bandwidth 320  mhz , are sent to a filter - bank consisting of @xmath20 channels of width 2.5  mhz .",
    "the data are digitized to one - bit precision , and the integration time is typically 4 to 16  min @xcite .",
    "off - line data reduction was performed in the following steps .",
    "the data for each pulsar were dedispersed and summed to produce a total intensity profile centered at 1540  mhz .",
    "local arrival times were determined by correlating the data with standard pulse profiles ; the pulse times of arrival ( toas ) normally correspond to the peak of the main pulse .",
    "toas at the solar - system barycenter were obtained using the standard timing program tempo with the jet propulsion laboratories de405 ephemeris @xcite . a model for the pulsar timing",
    "was fitted to these barycentric toas , weighted by the inverse square of their uncertainty .",
    "errors in the fitted parameters are taken to be twice the standard errors obtained from tempo .",
    "the basic timing model for the barycentric pulse phase , @xmath21 , as a function of time @xmath22 , is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the phase at time @xmath25 and @xmath3 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 represent the pulse frequency , frequency derivative and frequency second derivative respectively .",
    "pulsar positions were derived from long inter - glitch intervals with the residuals being `` whitened '' by fitting of higher - order frequency derivatives if necessary .",
    "glitches can be described as combinations of steps in @xmath3 and @xmath5 , of which parts may decay exponentially on various timescales .",
    "we assume a glitch model for the observed phenomenon as below : @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are , respectively , the permanent changes in frequency and frequency derivative relative to the pre - glitch values and @xmath32 is the amplitude of the exponential recovery with a decay time constant of @xmath33 .",
    "we note that for glitches the jump in frequency @xmath3 is positive and the jump in frequency derivative @xmath5 is usually negative .",
    "since @xmath26 is negative , a negative jump corresponds to an increase in magnitude of the spin - down rate .",
