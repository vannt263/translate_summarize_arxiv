    "in the current scenario of structure formation , galaxies are assumed to form in the cosmic density field through a series of physical processes , such as non - linear gravitational collapse , gas cooling and star formation . in this scenario the distribution of galaxies in space is expected to trace the underlying density field to some degree , but the relationship is not expected to be perfect , because many of the processes involved in galaxy formation can complicate the relationship between galaxies and the dark matter density field .",
    "thus , the study of galaxy clustering in space is an important step both in understanding the mass distribution in the universe , and in understanding how galaxies form in the cosmic density field .",
    "the statistical tool commonly adopted to quantify galaxy clustering in space is the correlation functions of galaxies ( peebles 1980 ) . during the last two decades , many authors have estimated the two - point correlation functions of galaxies using various redshift catalogs , to study how galaxy clustering depends on the properties of galaxies , such as luminosity ( e.g. brner , mo & zhou 1989 ; park et al . 1994 ; loveday et al .",

    "all these analyses show that galaxies of different properties may have different distributions in space , indicating that galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying density field and that one has to be careful when using the observed galaxy distribution to infer the mass distribution in the universe .",
    "the observed correlation functions of galaxies can provide important constraint on the relationship between galaxies and dark matter halos , as is demonstrated clearly in the recent halo - occupation and conditional - luminosity - function models ( jing , mo & brner 1998 ; seljak 2000 ; peacock & smith 2000 ; berlind & weinberg 2002 ; cooray & sheth 2002 ; yang , mo & van den bosch 2003 ; van den bosch , yang & mo 2003 ) . with accurate measurements of the clustering properties for galaxies of different properties , it is now possible to study in great detail how different galaxies occupy different halos and how galaxies trace the cosmic density field .",
    "the correlation analyses carried out so far are mostly based on the auto - correlation function of galaxies .",
    "although such analyses can provide important information about how a population of galaxies is distributed in space , they do not tell us anything about the relationship between galaxies of different properties .",
    "for example , two populations of galaxies may each be strongly clustered in space and yet be spatially segregated so that the cross - correlation between them is weak . in reality",
    ", all populations of galaxies may be biased tracers of the underlying mass distribution , and so they must all be positively correlated in space .",
    "however , the amplitude of the cross - correlation between any two populations of galaxies depends not only on the bias factors of these two populations , but also on how well each of them trace the mass density field , i.e. on the stochasticity in the bias relation .",
    "thus , it is important to measure the cross - correlation functions between galaxies of different properties , so as to quantify the relationships between the spatial distributions of different galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we use galaxy samples constructed from the sloan digital sky survey data release 4 ( sdss - dr4 ) to measure both the auto - correlation functions for galaxies of different luminosities and colors and the cross - correlation functions between different galaxies .",
    "we compare the shapes of the various correlation functions to check the validity of the assumption of linear bias . for each population of galaxies ( i.e. for galaxies within given ranges of luminosity and color )",
    ", we estimate its relative bias factors using its auto - correlation function as well all its cross - correlation functions with other populations of galaxies .",
    "these bias factors are averaged to give a mean bias factor for each population , and compared among themselves to constrain possible stochastic / nonlinear component in the bias relation ( mo & white 1996 ; dekel & lahav 1999 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_data ]",
    ", we describe the galaxy samples to be used and how random samples are constructed . in section [ sec_method ] , we describe our method for estimating the correlation functions .",

    "the version of the nyu - vagc used here is based on the sdss data release 4 ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2006 ) which consists of three regions : two in the northern galactic cap ( ngc ) and one in the southern galactic cap ( sgc ) .",
    "we refer the two ngc regions separately as ngce ( which is along the celestial equator ) and ngco ( which is off the equator ) .",
    "the sgc contains three stripes : one along the celestial equator , one to the north and one to the south . in this paper",
    ", we measure the correlation functions separately for ngce , ngco and sgc , and obtain the variance from these samples . while the total correlation functions of the whole samples are obtained by combining the pair counts in all these three regions .",
    "note that these three regions have quite large angular separations which ensure us to obtain a good estimation of the cosmic variance , except for those faintest galaxies at very low redshift where the variance may be somewhat underestimated .",
    "our main sample contains 284489 galaxies with extinction - corrected petrosian magnitudes in the range @xmath31 , redshifts in the range @xmath32 and absolute magnitudes in the range @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath34-band absolute magnitudes are corrected to redshift @xmath35 using the @xmath36-correction code of blanton et al.(2003a ) and the luminosity - evolution model ( @xmath37-correction ) of blanton et al.(2003b ) , given by @xmath38 in what follows , all absolute magnitudes and luminosities are quoted with such k- and e - corrections . in the apparent - magnitude limits adopted here , @xmath39 , the bright end is chosen to avoid incompleteness due to the large angular sizes of galaxies , while the faint end is chosen to match the magnitude limit of the sdss main galaxy sample . in our analysis",
    ", we will also use another apparent - magnitude criterion , @xmath40 to construct a supplemental sample .",
    "this sample has in total 287728 galaxies , about 3239 more than the main sample described above .",
    "most of these additional galaxies are intrinsically bright galaxies with low redshifts , and the use of these galaxies can significantly improve the signal of the cross - correlation function between the brightest and faintest samples by increasing their overlapping volume between them . as we will see below ,",
    "since we can normalize the cross - correlation function with the random sample constructed according to the faint sample that is complete , and since the incompleteness introduced by including the brightest galaxies is not expected to be correlated with the real structure , the incompleteness should not introduce significant bias in our results .    from our main sample , we first construct 6 volume - limited samples ( samples v1  v6 ) in six bins of absolute - magnitude ( @xmath41 ) : v1 ( -23.0,-21.5 ] , v2 ( -21.5,-21.0 ] , v3 ( -21.0,-20.5 ] , v4 ( -20.5,-20.0 ] , v5 ( -20.0,-19.0 ] , v6 ( -19.0,-18.0 ] , with detailed selection criteria given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "obviously , the redshift overlap between the brightest and faintest samples is small ( and sometimes none ) . in order to enlarge the redshift overlap , which is necessary in order to measure the cross correlations reliably ,",
    "we also construct 6 volume - limited samples , va  vf , from our supplemental sample . in the upper panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : mgr ] we show the magnitude - redshift distributions of 10% of all these volume - limited samples : v1v6 ( upper left panel ) and va  vf ( upper right panel ) .",
    "in addition to the volume - limited samples described above , we also construct 6 flux - limited samples , f1  f6 .",
    "as for samples",
    "v1  v6 , these are defined by the apparent magnitude limits @xmath42 and by a bin in absolute magnitude .",
    "however , no limits are imposed on the redshifts , as illustrated in the lower - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mgr ] .",
    "the details of these samples are given in table  [ tab2 ] , where the last column indicates the minimum and maximum redshifts of the galaxies in each sample ( which simply arise because of the apparent magnitude limits ) .",
    "the advantage of using flux - limited samples is that we have more galaxies in each sample , but the drawback is that the samples are not homogeneous in the radial direction , and so the two samples to be cross - correlated do not occupy exactly the same volume . as we will show below , the results based on the flux - limited samples are very similar to those based on the volume - limited samples . because of this , we will focus on the flux samples to take advantage of the larger sample sizes . for each of the flux - limited sample , we further divide galaxies into two color subsamples according to their @xmath43 colors .",
    "the dividing line is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath34 are the @xmath45-band and @xmath34-band magnitudes that are @xmath36-corrected ( blanton et al .",
    "2003a ) and @xmath37-corrected ( blanton et al .",

    "galaxies with @xmath43 color above ( below ) this line are called red ( blue ) galaxies , and the corresponding samples are denoted by @xmath19  @xmath29 ( red subsamples ) and @xmath20  @xmath30 ( blue subsamples ) .",

    ", we also construct a reference sample , f * , which includes all galaxies within a @xmath47-magnitude bin around @xmath5 .",
    "the selection criteria for this sample are listed in the last line of table [ tab2 ] .      in order to measure the two - point correlation functions",
    ", one needs to construct random samples to normalize the galaxy - pair counts .",
    "since we will study the clustering properties separately for all , red and blue galaxies , we need to generate random samples separately for each of them . in general ,",
    "if we know the luminosity function of galaxies , we can first construct a random sample with the luminosity function and then apply the observational magnitude limits .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have the luminosity functions for the red and blue galaxies defined according to the color criterion described above .",
    "because of this , here we adopt a method proposed in li et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , where a random sample is generated by assigning each galaxy in the real sample a random position in the sky while keeping all other properties ( i.e. , redshift , color , magnitude , etc . )",
    "unchanged . in what follows",
    "we refer to the random samples thus constructed as random samples of type r1 .",
    "note that these random samples have , by construction , exactly the same redshift distribution , @xmath48 , as the original sample .",
    "consequently , it is not exactly ` random ' in that it can still reveal structures in @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , this method is only expected to work well for wide - angle surveys in which the sky coverage is much larger than the large - scale structure in question .",
    "in addition , it requires that the variation in survey depth be small across the sky coverage ( li et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "although li et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that two - point correlation functions based on the random samples described above match well those obtained using random samples based on the luminosity function , we need to test whether or not the use of different random samples can have significant impact on our results for the smaller subsamples used here . to do this ,",
    "we generate another set of random samples for all galaxies according to the luminosity function obtained by blanton et al .",
    "( 2003b ) . here",
    "a large set of points are randomly distributed within the survey sky coverage and each point is assigned a redshift and a magnitude according to the luminosity function .",
    "this set of random samples will be referred to as type r2 .    for both sets of random samples ,",
    "the _ mangle _ software provided by a. hamilton ( hamilton & tegmark 2004 ) is used to locate the polygon i d for each random galaxy and to determine the completeness and magnitude limit ( which changes slightly across the sky coverage ) for this polygon using the mask provided by blanton et al .",
    "the completeness and magnitude limit so obtained are then included in the random samples . in calculating the two - point correlation functions for all galaxies we use random samples that are 10 time bigger than the observational data . while for red or blue galaxies we use random samples that are 15 times bigger than the observational data .",

    "we first obtain an average value of @xmath49 , @xmath405 , from all the correlation functions and then fit the projected 2pcf to get @xmath50 keeping @xmath406 .",

    "the only exception is @xmath408 , where the values of @xmath50 and @xmath49 for the volume - limited and flux - limited samples are significantly different , largely because the presence of the supercluster at @xmath409 that makes the correlation properties quite sensitive to how the sample is exactly formed .",
    "there is a clear trend in the correlation length @xmath50 that brighter galaxies have larger @xmath50 .",
    "the cross - correlations between bright and faint galaxies are also stronger than the auto correlations of faint galaxies . on the other hand",

    "[ fig2 ] shows that the clustering strengths for the samples that involve the brightest galaxies are enhanced on small scales ; in particular the cross correlation between the brightest and faintest galaxies is much stronger on small scales .",
    "for faint galaxies , the clustering strengths on small scales are similar to those based on the power laws obtained on large scales .",
    "this suggests that there is a significant population of faint galaxies that are distributed around the brightest galaxies and the number drops rapidly with the increase of the distance to the brightest galaxies . as we will see below ,",
    "it is likely that this population is dominated by faint red galaxies in clusters and groups .",
    "having investigated the clustering strengths for galaxies of different luminosities , we now study the bias factor in the distribution of galaxies as a function of galaxy luminosity .",
    "since we do not know the two - point correlation function of the cosmic density field , we can only study the bias factor in a relative sense . to do this ,",
    "we choose f4 as our fiducial sample , because it has a good overlap in volume with both the faint and bright samples .",
    "since each sample is used in a number of projected 2pcfs , we can estimate the relative bias for each sample in a number of ways .",

    "note that there is one data point missing in the first and fifth panels , because the overlap between samples f1 and f6 is too small to have a reliable measurement of @xmath421 .",
    "the dashed line in each panel is the average value of the relative bias obtained from the seven different approaches .",
    "as one can see , the relative bias factors obtained with different approaches are consistent with each other .",
    "we estimate the mean luminosity of galaxies in each sample f1f6 as @xmath422 , and the corresponding average absolute magnitudes thus obtained are @xmath423 , @xmath424 , @xmath425 , @xmath426 , @xmath427 , and @xmath428 , respectively .",

    "there is no enhancement in the cross - correlation functions on small scales between red galaxies and all except the brightest blue galaxies .",

    "( 2007 , in preparation ) , we find that @xmath994 ( @xmath995 ) of the brightest blue galaxies are the central galaxies of groups with masses @xmath996 ( @xmath997 ) , compared to @xmath998 ( @xmath999 ) for the red galaxies in the same luminosity bin .",
    "it is therefore possible that a fraction of the brightest blue galaxies are in fact ` early - type ' galaxies and their relatively blue colors are probably due to rejuvenation of star formation or agn activities in their centers .",
    "clearly , further analysis is required in order to understand the properties of this population of galaxies in more detail .",
    "next we discuss how our results may put constraints on the stochasticity / non - linearity in the bias relation .",

    "in general we may write it in terms of the density field of another population , @xmath1001 , as @xmath1002 where the first term on the right - hand side describes the linear part of the correlation between the two populations , the second term is the non - linear part , and @xmath1003 is the stochastic , uncorrelated part : @xmath1004 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath1005 and @xmath1006 thus , for any two populations we can define two relative bias factors , one based on the cross correlation with another population , and one based on the auto - correlation functions of the two populations : @xmath1007 @xmath1008 the square of the ratio between these two bias factors is @xmath1009 where @xmath1010 describes the contribution due to the non - linear part of the relative bias relation .",
    "note that @xmath1011 is related to the linear correlation coefficient , @xmath34 , defined in dekel & lahav ( 1999 ; their eq.[13 ] ) as @xmath1012 . for two populations , @xmath8 and @xmath9 that are entirely uncorrelated",
    "one has that @xmath1013 , while @xmath1014 when @xmath8 and @xmath9 are perfectly correlated .",
    "both the stochastic component , @xmath1015 , and the non - linear component , @xmath1016 , can cause @xmath10 to deviate from unity , and in general it is difficult to separate stochasticity from non - linearity . on large scales , however , the non - linear component in the bias relation may be neglected , and we have that @xmath1017 to examine the importance of stochasticity / non - linearity in the relative bias relations , we calculate @xmath10 for galaxies of different luminosities and colors . based on equation ( [ ratio : bias ] ) , we estimate @xmath10 using @xmath1018 where @xmath1019 and @xmath1020 are the auto - correlation functions of subsamples ` @xmath8 ' and ` @xmath9 ' , respectively , and @xmath7 is the cross- correlation function between the two subsamples . note that ` @xmath8 ' and ` @xmath9 ' denote not only luminosity samples but also color samples . unlike what we did above",

    "the large value of @xmath1029 on small scales between red and blue galaxies ( except the brightest blue galaxies ) is almost certainly due to the fact that blue galaxies of low and intermediate luminosities avoid dense groups and clusters while red galaxies reside preferentially in such places .",
