    "the standard model of particle physics is a successful theory that has passed a number of high - precision tests .",
    "one crucial building block is the higgs sector which renders the perturbative expansion of correlation functions well defined and parameterizes the masses of matter fields and weak gauge bosons .",
    "so far , the higgs sector has been indirectly tested by the precision data but will be directly explored at the lhc . beyond this success ,",
    "two problems of the standard model have been particularly inspiring to design new ideas for a larger fundamental framework : the hierarchy problem and the triviality problem .",
    "whereas the hierarchy problem is not a fundamental problem in the sense of rendering the standard model ill - defined , the triviality problem truly inhibits an extension of the standard model to arbitrarily high momentum scales . loosely speaking",
    ", the scale of maximum ultra - violet ( uv ) extension @xmath2 induced by triviality is related to the landau pole of perturbation theory .",
    "the standard model has triviality problems in both the higgs sector @xcite as well as the u(1 ) gauge sector @xcite .",
    "but since @xmath3 of the higgs sector is much smaller than that of the u(1 ) sector @xcite , evading triviality in the higgs sector is of primary importance .",
    "in fact for heavy higgs boson masses , the scale of maximum uv extension @xmath2 could be much smaller than the planck or gut scale @xcite .",
    "for supersymmetrically extended models , @xmath2 can even be smaller than in the standard model @xcite .",
    "traces of the triviality problem can already be found in perturbation theory .",
    "the relation between bare and renormalized four - higgs - boson coupling @xmath4 in one - loop rg - improved perturbation theory is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the bare and @xmath7 the renormalized coupling ; @xmath8 is the uv cutoff scale and @xmath9 denotes a renormalized mass scale .",
    "the first @xmath10 function coefficient @xmath11 is generically positive for @xmath12 theories . keeping @xmath7 and @xmath9 fixed ,",
    "say as measured in an experiment at an infrared ( ir ) scale , an increase of the uv cutoff @xmath8 has to be compensated by an increase of the bare coupling @xmath6 .",
    "but @xmath6 eventually hits infinity at a finite uv scale @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "this landau pole provides for a first estimate of the scale of maximum uv extension @xmath14 .",
    "of course , perturbation theory is useless for a reliable estimate of @xmath2 , since it is an expansion about zero coupling .",
    "near the landau pole , nonperturbative physics can set in and severely modify the picture .",
    "in fact , the qed landau pole has been shown to be outside the physical parameter space , since it is screened by the nonperturbative phenomenon of chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "( still , there remains a finite scale of maximum uv extension @xmath15 . ) a study of the triviality problem therefore mandatorily requires a nonperturbative tool .",
    "the hierarchy problem of the standard model is a fine - tuning problem of initial conditions and arises also from the properties of the higgs sector . for generic values of",
    "the initial squared bare higgs mass scale @xmath16 at uv cutoff @xmath8 , the system is either in the symmetric phase exhibiting no electroweak symmetry breaking , or it is in the broken phase with gauge , higgs - boson and fermion masses of order @xmath8 .",
    "both phases are separated by a quantum phase transition at a critical value @xmath17 . a large hierarchy , i.e. , a large separation of particle masses from the cutoff scale , requires an extremely fine - tuned value of @xmath18 close to the critical value . for instance , separating the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking @xmath19 from the uv scale , e.g. , given by a gut scale @xmath20 , requires to fine - tune @xmath18 to @xmath21 within a precision of @xmath22 .",
    "this problem of `` unnatural '' initial conditions stems from the fact that the mass parameter in the higgs sector renormalizes quadratically @xmath23 . in a renormalization group ( rg )",
    "language , the critical value @xmath17 denotes a strongly ir repulsive fixed point with critical exponent @xmath24 .",
    "again , these statements hold in the vicinity of the gauian fixed point , where all couplings are small and perturbation theory holds .",
    "we stress that there is nothing conceptually wrong with fine - tuned initial conditions , but it is generally considered as unsatisfactory .",
    "a solution of the hierarchy problem should either explain the fine - tuned initial conditions within an underlying theory or correspond to a uv extension of the standard model which has no critical exponents significantly larger than zero , implying a slow , say logarithmic , running of the parameters .",
    "this work is devoted to an investigation of a simple yukawa model , serving as a toy - model for the higgs sector of the standard model . using the functional rg as a nonperturbative approach , we systematically search for the existence of non - gauian interacting fixed points of the rg flow which could facilitate an extension of the model to arbitrarily high momentum scales .",
    "if such a system sits on a trajectory that hits the fixed point in the uv , the uv cutoff can safely be taken to infinity , @xmath25 , and the theory is _ asymptotically safe _ in weinberg s sense @xcite , see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "such fixed points would not only solve the triviality problem by construction , but could have small critical exponents as required for a solution of the hierarchy problem .",
    "a paradigm example for an asymptotically safe theory are four - fermion models such as the gross - neveu model in @xmath26 dimensions @xcite .",
    "even though these models are perturbatively not renormalizable and thus seemingly trivial , they are nonperturbatively renormalizable at a non - gauian fixed point and hence can be extended to arbitrarily high scales .",
    "a similar result has been found for nonlinear sigma models in @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "recently , even the program of quantizing gravity with the aid of a non - gauian fixed point within an asymptotic - safety scenario has become exceedingly successful @xcite ; this also includes certain models with a nontrivial scalar sector @xcite .",
    "asymptotically safe scenarios have also been successfully developed for extra - dimensional gauge theories @xcite .",
    "furthermore standard - model alternatives without a fundamental higgs field have been based on asymptotically safe fermionic scenarios @xcite , which , however , are generically plagued by a strong hierarchy problem ; see also @xcite for an asymptotically free fermionic model where nonlocal interactions lead to an improved hierarchy .    in the context of the higgs sector of the standard model , an asymptotically safe scenario can have further advantages in addition to solving the fundamental problems of triviality and hierarchy .",
    "contrary to many other ideas for addressing these problems , our approach does not introduce new degrees of freedom or further symmmetries and thus no new parameters . indeed , asymptotic safety can lead to a reduction of parameters and hence have more predictive power , since the number of physical parameters to be determined by experiment depends on the properties of the non - gauian fixed point , i.e. , on the dynamics of the theory . the price to be paid",
    "is that we have to give up on the requirement of perturbativity @xcite , stating that the standard model should never leave the gauian fixed - point regime , being the domain of validity of perturbative theory .",
    "there might indeed be no fundamental reason for this requirement except for saving human beings from having to deal with nonperturbative problems .",
    "a crucial question for all nonperturbative techniques is the systematic consistency and reliability of the results . in this work ,",
    "we compute the rg flow of the model in a systematic derivative expansion of the effective action .",
    "this expansion is controlled if the momentum dependence of full effective vertices takes only little influence on the flow .",
    "a direct means for measuring this influence is the size of the anomalous dimensions @xmath28 of the fields , since next - to - leading order contributions couple to the leading - order derivative expansion only via terms @xmath29 .",
    "monitoring the size of @xmath28 thus gives us a direct estimate of the reliability of our results .",
    "our results can be summarized in a simple picture : the rg flow of the yukawa model can be in the symmetric ( sym ) regime or in the regime of spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) where the bosonic field expectation value @xmath30 is nonzero , @xmath31 .",
    "whereas we do not find interacting fixed points in the sym regime , the structure of the flow becomes richer in the ssb regime , since new interactions can be mediated by the condensate .",
    "however , the flow in the ssb regime is typically characterized by a _",
    "freeze - out _ of all couplings .",
    "this is because all particles coupling to the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) acquire a mass and decouple from the flow .",
    "our central idea is that the contributions with opposite sign from bosonic and fermionic fluctuations to the vev can be balanced such that the vev exhibits a conformal behavior , @xmath32 . here , @xmath33 is the scale at which we consider the couplings of the system .",
    "the dimensionless squared vev @xmath34 has a flow equation of the form @xmath35 if the interaction terms are absent , the gauian fixed point @xmath36 is the only conformal point , corresponding to a free massless theory .",
    "if the interaction terms are nonzero , e.g. , if the couplings approach interacting fixed points by themselves , the sign of these terms decides about a possible conformal behavior . a positive contribution from the interaction terms gives rise to a fixed point at @xmath37 which can control the conformal running over many scales .",
    "if they are negative , no conformal vev is possible .",
    "since fermions and bosons contribute with opposite signs to the interaction terms , the existence of a fixed point @xmath38 crucially depends on the relative strength between bosonic and fermionic fluctuations . more specifically ,",
    "the bosons have to win out over the fermions .    .",

    "dotted line : fermions dominate , inhibiting an acceptable non - gauian fixed point for positive @xmath40 . dashed line : bosonic fluctuations dominate , inducing a non - gauian fixed point @xmath41 with conformal behavior of the higgs expectation value . in the present set of yukawa systems ,",
    "this behavior occurs at small @xmath1 , @xmath42 .",

    "[ fig : sketch ] , we sketch various options for the flow of the dimensionless squared vev @xmath40 .",
    "the solid line depicts the free massless theory with a trivial gauian fixed point at @xmath36 .",
    "if the fermions dominate , the interaction terms are negative and the fixed point is shifted to negative values ( being irrelevant for physics ) , cf .",
    "dotted line .",
    "if the bosonic fluctuations dominate , the @xmath40 flow develops a non - gauian fixed point at positive values @xmath41 that can support a conformal behavior over many orders of magnitude , cf . dashed line .",
    "this fixed point is uv attractive , implying that the vev is a relevant operator near the fixed point .",
    "if the interaction terms are approximately @xmath40 independent , the slope of @xmath43 near the fixed point is still close to @xmath44 , corresponding to a critical exponent @xmath45 and a persistent hierarchy problem .",
    "an improvement of `` naturalness '' could arise from a suitable @xmath40 dependence of the interaction terms that results in a flattening of the @xmath40 flow near the fixed point , cf .",
    "dot - dashed line .",
    "whether or not this happens is a result of and can be computed within the theory .    for the simple yukawa systems considered here",
    ", we find fermionic dominance for one or more fermion flavors , excluding an asymptotic safety scenario of this kind .",
    "in fact , a careful analysis of the model in the sym regime as well as the ssb regime reveals that no non - gauian fixed point exists in the accessible parameter range neither for strong coupling nor induced by balanced threshold behavior . nevertheless , this fermion dominance is not an unavoidable property of the system , but a result of the algebraic details of the model .",
    "this is illustrated by treating the flavor number @xmath1 as a continuous variable .",
    "we observe boson dominance for @xmath46 , implying the existence of a suitable non - gauian fixed point and a non - trivial interacting fundamental theory valid on all scales .",
    "we also find a dependence of the largest critical exponent on the flavor number , supporting also reductions from the value @xmath24 .",
    "however , a significant hierarchy always remains in the simple models considered here .",
    "two features render our mechanism particularly attractive : first , the uv fixed - point properties are such that the system has one parameter less than expected ; in other words , once the top mass and the higgs vev are fixed , the higgs mass is a true prediction of the theory .",
    "second , the set of all possible flows that start from the uv fixed - point lead to a constrained set of physical low - energy values ; most importantly , the top mass does generically not become much lighter than the vev , offering a natural explanation for the large mass of the top .",

    "the search for asymptotically safe field theories adds an interesting twist to the realm of quantum field theoretic problems .",
    "standard problems start from a microscopic bare action that has to be quantized in order to construct quantum correlation functions . in the present case",
    ", we do not even know the microscopic action to be quantized , but we try to construct it by searching for a non - gauian fixed point action in the space of all possible action functionals , i.e. , in _ theory space_. in other words , we wish to quantize a generic action of a system which is specified by its degrees of freedom and its symmetries .",
    "this is indeed possible with the aid of the functional rg which provides a vector field @xmath48 in theory space in terms of rg @xmath10-functions for all possible generalized couplings @xmath49 .",
    "the functional rg can conveniently be formulated in terms of a flow equation for the effective average action @xmath50 , the wetterich equation @xcite : @xmath51          = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{str}\\{[\\gamma^{(2)}_k[\\phi]+r_k]^{-1}(\\partial_tr_k)\\ } ,          \\quad { \\partial_t}=k\\frac{d}{dk }        .\\ ] ] here , @xmath52 is the second functional derivative with respect to the field @xmath53 ( the latter representing a collective field variable for all bosonic or fermionic degrees of freedom ) , and @xmath54 denotes a momentum - dependent regulator function that suppresses ir modes below a momentum scale @xmath33 .",
    "the solution to the wetterich equation provides for an rg trajectory in theory space , interpolating between the bare action @xmath55 to be quantized @xmath56 and the full quantum effective action @xmath57 , being the generating functional of 1pi correlation functions ; for reviews , see @xcite .",
    "a quantum field theory can be considered as fundamental , if its rg trajectory can be extended over all scales which requires that the uv cutoff @xmath8 can be sent to infinity .",
    "this is , for instance , possible if the trajectory approaches a fixed point in theory space .",
    "let us assume that the effective average action @xmath50 can be parameterized by a possibly infinite set of generalized dimensionless couplings @xmath58 .",
    "then , the wetterich equation provides us with the flow of these couplings @xmath59 .",
    "a fixed point @xmath60 is defined by @xmath61 the fixed point is non - gauian , if at least one fixed - point coupling is nonzero @xmath62 .",
    "if the rg trajectory flows into a fixed point in the uv , the uv cutoff can safely be taken to infinity and the system approaches a conformally invariant state for @xmath63 .",
    "in addition to being fundamental , we also want the theory to be predictive . for this , we consider the fixed - point regime , where the flow can be linearized , @xmath64 diagonalizing the stability matrix @xmath65 , @xmath66 in terms of right - eigenvectors @xmath67 which are enumerated by the index @xmath68 , the resulting _ critical exponents _",
    "@xmath69 allow for a classification of physical parameters .",
    "the solution of the coupling flow in the fixed - point regime is given by @xmath70 where the integration parameters @xmath71const .",
    "define the initial conditions at a reference scale @xmath72 . whereas all eigendirections with @xmath73 die out towards the ir and thus are irrelevant",
    ", all relevant directions with @xmath74 increase towards the ir and thus determine the macroscopic physics ( for the marginal directions @xmath75 , it depends on the higher - order terms in the expansion about the fixed point ) .",
    "hence the number of relevant and marginally - relevant directions determines the number of physical parameters to be fixed .",
    "the theory is predictive if this number is finite .",
    "if a critical exponent is much larger than zero , say of @xmath76 , the rg trajectory rapidly leaves the fixed - point regime towards the ir .",
    "therefore , separating a typical uv scale where the system is close to the fixed point from the ir scales where , e.g. , physical masses are generated requires a significant fine - tuning of the initial conditions . in the context of the standard model ,",
    "the size of the largest @xmath69 is a quantitative measure of the hierarchy problem .    for the flow towards the ir , the linearized fixed - point flow eq .",
    "generally is insufficient and the full nonlinear @xmath10 functions have to be taken into account .",
    "even the parameterization of the effective action in terms of the same degrees of freedom in the uv and ir might be inappropriate .",
    "nevertheless , we use the same bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom on all scales in the present work , since we specifically want to address the question whether standard - model ir degrees of freedom can have an interacting uv completion .      in the present work ,",
    "we concentrate on a @xmath0 invariant yukawa theory , involving one real scalar field and @xmath77 dirac fermions .",
    "this model mimics the higgs sector of the standard model , in the sense that spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) in the scalar sector can generate fermion masses .",
    "also , since the symmetry is discrete , no goldstone bosons are generated in the ssb phase .    in the spirit of perturbative power - counting near the gauian fixed point , the microscopic action subject to perturbative quantization",
    "would read @xmath78 where the bare parameter space would be spanned by the boson mass @xmath79 , the boson interaction @xmath80 and the yukawa coupling @xmath81 .    in order to allow for more general actions also near interacting fixed points",

    "let us finally mention that the derivative expansion is not only technically motivated due to its systematics and consistency , it has also proved to contain the relevant degrees of freedom for a variety of systems , yielding quantitatively satisfactory results .",

    "in the following two sections , we carefully analyze the system in the sym as well as the ssb regime for @xmath47 .",
    "we have checked that our findings for the search for non - gauian fixed points extend also to larger natural values of the flavor number .",

    "the resulting higgs mass then is a parameter - free prediction of the system .",

    "it runs to a constant value in the ir , corresponding to the properties of the ssb phase .",
    "the middle and the lower plot show the running of @xmath114 and @xmath129 from the uv fixed point regime via the crossover regime to the ir decoupling regime as described in the text.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ] .",

    "an interesting property of the asymptotically safe system is that the set of possible ir values for the renormalized couplings is generically bounded , i.e. , not all conceivable values of the physical parameters lie on rg trajectories that emanate from the non - gauian fixed point . in the present case",
    ", we observe that it is not possible to tune the flow for @xmath189 below a certain value @xmath190 , implying that a lower bound on @xmath191 exists .",
    "the mechanism behind this property can easily be understood .",
    "the rg flow passes essentially through three regimes : the fixed - point regime in the uv , the decoupling regime in the ir , and a crossover regime in - between . in the uv fixed - point regime",
    ", the system behaves conformally and all couplings stay close to their fixed point values .",
    "the decoupling regime in the ir is characterized by the freeze - out of the dimensionful higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath30 .",
    "this generates higgs and top masses which decouple from the flow at scales @xmath192 .",
    "no massless modes remain and all running couplings freeze out and approach their ir values . the crossover regime in - between connects the uv fixed - point with the ir decoupling regime . here , all couplings run fast and the full nonperturbative dynamics becomes important .",
    "generically all @xmath10 functions are sizeable here , so that the system spends little `` rg time '' in the crossover regime .",
    "this implies that the yukawa coupling has little rg time to run from its large uv fixed - point value to its physical ir value , before it freezes out due to decoupling .    technically , we observe that there is a very robust ir fixed point in the ssb flow equations that attracts the flow towards the ir in the crossover regime . in the simple @xmath12 truncation ,",
    "it is characterized by fixed - point values @xmath193 .",
    "this fixed point is not directly physically relevant as @xmath194 .",
    "the ssb constraint @xmath37 however implies that the physical yukawa coupling is bounded by this ir fixed - point value , @xmath195 .",
    "we conclude that an asymptotically safe yukawa system offers a natural explanation for a large top mass .",
    "we have used a simple @xmath0-invariant yukawa system with massless fermions and a real scalar field in order to explore the possibility of asymptotically safe yukawa systems for a solution of the triviality and hierarchy problem in the standard model . employing the functional rg within a systematic and consistent derivative expansion of the effective action",
    ", we have identified a new mechanism based on a conformal higgs vacuum expectation value that can give rise to a non - gauian interacting stable uv fixed point . by contrast , our study of the symmetric regime at vanishing expectation value confirms the triviality of the higgs sector nonperturbatively , as both essential couplings , the yukawa coupling and the @xmath12 interaction , are marginally irrelevant .",
    "whether or not asymptotic safety based on a conformal higgs expectation value is realized , depends on the algebraic structure of the theory , in particular on the relative strength between bosonic and fermionic fluctuations .",
    "our results show that this yukawa model is not asymptotically safe for @xmath47 or larger , since fermionic fluctuations dominate the running of the expectation value , rapidly driving the system to decoupling of massive modes . allowing for arbitrary positive real values of @xmath1 , we discover yukawa systems at @xmath46 where a conformal expectation value induces the desired non - gauian fixed point and renders the models asymptotically safe .",
    "these models do not have a triviality problem but can be extended to arbitrarily large momentum scales and are thus candidates for a fundamental quantum field theory . within the derivative expansion , we find evidence that the hierarchy problem can be less severe in these systems in the sense that the largest relevant coupling renormalizes softer than quadratically .",
    "there are two most attractive features of such asymptotically safe yukawa systems .",
    "first , the uv fixed point exhibits only two rg relevant directions , implying that the ir physics of the system is fully determined by fixing two physical parameters .",
    "for instance , once the top mass and the higgs vacuum expectation value are fixed , the higgs mass is a true and parameter - free prediction of the model .",
    "this clearly distinguishes our scenario from many other suggestions of physics beyond the standard model where the hierarchy and triviality problem are solved or reparameterized at the expense of an increasing number of parameters .",
    "second , the range of possible physical ir parameters is generically bounded , since the set of possible rg trajectories emanating from the uv fixed - point map out a bounded ir parameter region . in the present example , the top mass is bounded from below for models in the higgs phase of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "therefore , our scenario offers a natural explanation for large values of the top mass .",
    "even though our basic concept does deliberately not invoke supersymmetric structures , there are certain similarities to properties of supersymmetric theories . in the latter ,",
    "supersymmetric partners to standard - model particles are introduced in order to enhance the symmetry of the theory .",
    "this enhanced symmetry guarantees substantial cancellations between bosonic and fermionic fluctuations , such that crucial parameters such as the higgs mass remain protected against strong renormalization . in our case , there is no enhanced symmetry , but the dynamical properties of the theory itself make it possible that fermionic and bosonic fluctuation contributions to the vacuum expectation value @xmath30 balance each other and induce a conformal threshold behavior over many orders of magnitude .    from a technical perspective ,",
    "asymptotically safe scenarios are difficult to establish due to the inherent nonperturbative and hence less controllable nature .",
    "this is particularly true if a possible non - gauian uv fixed point is a pure strong - coupling phenomenon . in the present case , asymptotic safety",
    "does not predominantly rely on strong coupling but is induced by the conformal threshold behavior of the higgs expectation value . even though threshold physics is also",
    "inherently nonperturbative , it does not require particularly strong coupling .",
    "our findings indicate , that the derivative expansion of the effective action is not only systematic and consistent , but also well suited to reliably explore this asymptotic - safety scenario : the anomalous dimensions , serving as effective expansion parameters , remain small , and all qualitative features are robust when going from leading - order to next - to - leading order . on the other hand , reliable quantitative results for physical quantities such as the uv critical exponents or the ir higgs mass prediction certainly require a larger truncation particularly in the boson - fermion coupling sector .    in the light of our results , a search for asymptotically safe yukawa systems also by other methods would be highly welcome . for the present simple system ,",
    "small-@xmath1 expansion techniques appear to be most promising .",
    "these indeed exist within the worldline approach to quantum field theory , where subclasses of infinitely many feynman diagrams can be resummed into closed worldline expressions order by order in a small-@xmath1 expansion .",
    "these methods have been shown to work in pure scalar models so far @xcite and need to be generalized to fermions .",
    "of course , also many non - perturbative lattice studies of yukawa systems exist , see @xcite for reviews , recently also employing chirally - invariant lattice fermions @xcite .",
    "the fact that no non - gauian fixed points have been found in standard settings so far ( for alternative higher - derivative models , see @xcite ) is well in accord with our findings .",
    "since lattice realizations often have a large fermion number , the resulting fermion dominance generically inhibits a conformal threshold behavior required for our scenario .",
    "moreover , since our non - gauian fixed point has two relevant directions , a tuning of two bare parameters is required in order to take the corresponding continuum limit on a line of constant physics . even though this is certainly possible on the lattice , this point",
    "can easily be missed during a general lattice study .",
    "whereas yukawa systems with @xmath46 are unlikely to be relevant for the true higgs sector of the standard model , our results clearly indicate that an asymptotic safety scenario based on a conformal threshold behavior requires a balancing between bosons and fermions .",
    "hence , we expect that a variety of realistic models exists where the fermion contributions are balanced by a sufficiently large bosonic sector .",
    "work in this direction also involving chiral structures is in progress .",

    "<S> , we look for uv stable fixed points which could render the system asymptotically safe . whether a balancing of fermionic and bosonic contributions in the rg flow induces such a fixed point depends on the algebraic structure and the degrees of freedom of the system . within the region of parameter space which can be controlled by a nonperturbative next - to - leading order derivative expansion of the effective action </S>",
    "<S> , we find no non - gau ian fixed point in the case of one or more fermion flavors . </S>",
    "<S> the fermion - boson balancing can still be demonstrated within a model system with a small fractional flavor number in the symmetry - broken regime . </S>",
    "<S> the uv behavior of this small-@xmath1 system is controlled by a conformal higgs expectation value . </S>",
    "<S> the system has only two physical parameters , implying that the higgs mass can be predicted . </S>",
    "<S> it also naturally explains the heavy mass of the top quark , since there are no rg trajectories connecting the uv fixed point with light top masses . </S>"
