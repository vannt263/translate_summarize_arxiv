    "the incompressible quantum liquids ( iqls ) @xcite continue to be the subject of extensive studies ever since the famous discovery of the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect @xcite .",
    "the iqls are formed by two - dimensional electrons placed in a high magnetic field @xmath4 which causes them to fill a particular fraction @xmath5 of one of the lowest landau levels ( ll@xmath6 , @xmath7 , 1 ,  ) .",
    "the most recent storm of interest in the iqls is motivated by the concept of `` topological quantum computation '' @xcite employing non - abelian statistics of some of the wave functions proposed for a partially filled ll@xmath8 .",
    "the main idea is that the quantum information may be encoded in ( topologically ) different quantum states corresponding to the same spatial configuration of the non - abelian quasiparticles ( qps ) of a given underlying iql .",
    "transition between such different states would only be possible by a global transformation of the qp braiding , thereby making quantum information inherently protected from decoherence caused by any local processes ( e.g. , coupling to phonons or atomic spins ) .",
    "the best known candidate for a non - abelian wave function is the `` pfaffian '' state proposed by moore and read @xcite and believed to describe the fqh state in a half - filled ll@xmath8 .",
    "other wave functions with different complexities of braiding statistics have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "the convincing demonstration of non - abelian statistics in a real physical system has clearly risen to the challenge of greatest importance .",
    "the reason to search for the signatures of non - abelian statistics in ll@xmath8 is that , on the one hand , the partially filled ll@xmath9 are successfully described by the composite fermion ( cf ) theory @xcite predicting fractional but abelian qps and , on the other hand , that higher lls favor ordered electron phases .",
    "crucial recent experiments in ll@xmath8 include confirmation @xcite of the anticipated qp charge of @xmath10 for the half - filled state at @xmath1 and careful measurements @xcite of the minute excitation gaps . in theory ,",
    "some of the most recent advances are related to the role of layer width @xcite and ll mixing @xcite in real systems , and the nature of the qps @xcite .",
    "it is quite remarkable that , despite intensive studies , connection of the fqh states in ll@xmath8 ( @xmath1 , @xmath11 , @xmath2 , or @xmath12 ) to the few proposed wave functions remains yet to be conclusively established .",
    "in fact , in some cases it seems only tentatively assumed for the lack of other candidates .",
    "this is an urgent problem , as the anticipation of non - abelian statistics in nature is largely driven by the connection of some of these wave functions to the particular conformal field theories .",
    "a wealth of iqls found in various systems ( electrons or cfs at different fillings of different lls , in layers of varied width @xmath13 ) also invites a more general question of possible iqls with arbitrary ll filling @xmath5 and interaction @xmath14 .",
    "this paper is an extension of our brief communication @xcite .",
    "we report here on the use of large scale exact diagonalization in the search of iqls with non - abelian statistics .",
    "we demonstrate that non - abelian iqls in ll@xmath8 can only emerge in the narrow , particle - hole symmetric range of filling factors @xmath15 . in this range ,",
    "the known non - abelian candidates at @xmath1 and @xmath2 are closely examined ( including such previously neglected realistic effects as finite layer width and ll mixing ) and found to have favorable correlation energies . outside of this range",
    ", the ll@xmath8 hosts the family of abelian ground states of noninteracting cfs each carrying four magnetic flux quanta , repeating the states known from the lowest ll .",
    "the borderline @xmath16 ground state in ll@xmath8 is adiabatically connected to the laughlin state of ll@xmath9 , but it has a smaller gap and distinct short - range correlations .",
    "we consider the systems of @xmath17 spin - polarized fermions ( electrons ) on a haldane sphere with unit radius and the magnetic monopole of strength @xmath18 inside @xcite . in this geometry , ll@xmath6 is a shell of angular momentum @xmath19 , and different @xmath17-body wave functions at the same @xmath5 are ( unlike on a torus ) conveniently distinguished by a ` shift ' @xmath20 between the ll degeneracy and @xmath21 ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) .",
    "in contrast to the previous exact diagonalization studies we begin by searching the universality classes @xmath23 of the gapped ground states with arbitrary interactions @xmath14 rather than confining ourselves to the particular physical systems defined by @xmath24 , @xmath13 , etc .    it is a trivial fact that the many - body dynamics in a degenerate ll is completely determined by an interaction pseudopotential , defined @xcite as the dependence of the pair energy @xmath14 on the relative angular momentum @xmath25 , 3 ,  .",
    "less obviously , @xmath26 induces particular correlations only through its deviation from a reference `` harmonic pseudopotential '' given by a straight line over the consecutive @xmath27 s @xcite .",
    "hence , the low - energy spectra of @xmath26 can be accurately reproduced by a suitable effective pseudopotential @xmath28 with only a few appropriate coefficients .",
    "in our calculations we have used @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "higher - order terms have been ignored , as they are essentially irrelevant for the dynamics in a liquid phase with short - range correlations . on the other hand , going beyond the ( earlier used ) @xmath30 and @xmath31 was needed for an improved description of the two lowest ( electron or cf ) lls known to host iql states . at the same time , it still allowed for useful graphical representation of the ground state properties in an effectively two - dimensional space of the ( normalized , @xmath32 ) parameters @xmath28 .",

    "the gap @xmath33 is defined as the energy difference from the ground state to the first excited state in the same spectrum as long as the ground state happens to be nondegenerate ( i.e. , has zero total angular momentum , @xmath42 ) ; otherwise @xmath33 is set to zero .",
    "the iql candidates are the islands of positive @xmath33 repeating regularly in the same area of the map for different values of @xmath17 .",
