    "collisions of binary black holes are expected to be one of the primary sources of gravitational radiation to be detected by interferometric gravitational wave detectors . given the non - symmetric , time - dependent nature of the problem , the only realistic hope of modeling a collision is via numerical simulations .",
    "unfortunately , given computer limitations , it is expected that in the near future most evolutions will have to start with the black holes quite close to each other .",
    "this brings to the forefront the problem of specifying initial data for the binary black hole collisions .",
    "ideally , one would like to have initial data representing `` astrophysically relevant '' situations , that is , resembling the situation the two black holes would be in when they are in a realistic collision at the given separation .",
    "unfortunately , providing realistic data is tantamount to solving the evolution problem .",
    "since this can not be done , one is left with generating families of initial data based on mathematical or computational convenience . initial attempts to provide initial data concentrated on solutions to the initial value problem that were conformally flat @xcite .",
    "conformally flat spatial metrics simplify considerably the constraint equations but suffer from drawbacks , most notably the inability to incorporate kerr black holes , which are not known to have conformally flat sections ( for a perturbative proof of non - existence , see @xcite ) . recently",
    ", attention has been drawn to the construction of initial data based on the kerr ",
    "schild form of the schwarzschild and kerr metrics .",
    "these constructions have several attractive properties : the slices are horizon - penetrating , which makes them suitable for the application of the `` excision '' technique for evolving black holes , and they can naturally incorporate boosted and spinning black holes @xcite .    there have been two different proposals to use kerr  schild coordinates for binary black holes . in the proposal of huq , matzner and shoemaker @xcite , two black holes individually in kerr ",
    "schild form were superposed . in the proposal of bishop _",
    "@xcite the superposition was carried out in a way that the resulting superposed metric was in kerr ",
    "schild form .",
    "this latter proposal has the property that in the `` close limit '' in which the separation of the holes is small , the metric is given by a distorted kerr - schild black hole .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the evolution of the bishop _",
    "et al . _ family of initial data in the close limit , by treating the space - time as a small perturbation of a non - rotating kerr  schild black hole .",
    "the evolution will be carried out using a recently introduced perturbative formalism that allows to evolve schwarzschild black holes in arbitrary spherically symmetric coordinates @xcite .",
    "we will present an explicit solution to the initial value problem posed by bishop _",
    "_ in the close limit and use it to compute the radiated energy in the black hole collision",
    ". this in turn will help use clarify the meaning of free parameters that appear in these families of data .",
    "in their paper , bishop _ et al . _",
    "@xcite assume that at the initial slice , the three metric and the extrinsic curvature are of kerr - schild ( ks ) type .",
    "the ks space - time metric is defined by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is null .",
    "the `` background '' metric @xmath2 is taken to be the minkowski metric with coordinates @xmath3 such that @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the null vector @xmath1 satisfies @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 . as an example , for the schwarzschild geometry , @xmath10 for a ks metric , the three metric and extrinsic curvature with respect to a slice @xmath11 are @xmath12 , \\label{eq - ksgk2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the lapse and where @xmath14 refers to the flat metric @xmath15 .",
    "s solution procedure consists in inserting ( [ eq - ksgk1],[eq - ksgk2 ] ) into the constraint equations and to solve the resulting equations for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is assumed to be given .",
    "( @xmath19 has only two independent components since @xmath8 . ) below , we review the discussion of these equation where a particular ansatz is made for @xmath19 representing two nearby non - rotating and non - spinning black holes .",
    "a single schwarzschild black hole can be represented as @xmath20 .",
    "for two black holes , bishop _",
    "_ make the ansatz @xmath21 where @xmath22 denote the position of the black hole @xmath23 which has mass @xmath24 .",
    "if the black holes are located at @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , @xmath27 may be expanded in a sum over multipoles : @xmath28 where @xmath29 denote standard legendre polynomials and where @xmath30 are polar coordinates for @xmath31 .",
    "it is important to note that the expansion ( [ eq - twobhexp ] ) is only valid for @xmath32 .    defining the separation parameter @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the total mass , and imposing the center of mass condition @xmath35 ,",
    "the close limit of ( [ eq - twobhexp ] ) becomes @xmath36 as a result , to first order in @xmath37 , @xmath19 is given by @xmath38 where here and in the following , @xmath39 .",
    "the remaining amplitudes are expanded according to @xmath40 ( in bishop _",
    "s notation : @xmath41 and @xmath42 . ) introducing this into the constraint equations , and keeping only terms of the order @xmath37 , one obtains the equations @xmath43 here , a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath44 .",
    "the system ( [ eq - c2],[eq - c3 ] ) can be re - expressed as a single second order equation . introducing the dimensionless quantities @xmath45 and @xmath46 , this equation reads @xmath47",
    "once we have solved this equation , the remaining amplitudes @xmath48 and @xmath49 are obtained from ( [ eq - c1 ] ) and ( [ eq - c2 ] ) , respectively .      a particular solution of ( [ eq - keyeq ] ) is given by @xmath50 in order to find the solutions of the homogeneous equation , one performs the transformations @xmath51 , @xmath52 , which yields the bessel differential equation @xmath53 the solutions are a linear combination of the bessel functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "while @xmath54 behaves as @xmath56 for small @xmath57 , @xmath55 has the expansion @xcite @xmath58 near @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the general solution to ( [ eq - keyeq ] ) is @xmath60 , with @xmath61 while @xmath62 is regular at @xmath63 for any values of the constants @xmath64 , @xmath65 , equation ( [ eq - c2 ] ) shows that in order for @xmath48 to be regular at @xmath63 , it is necessary that @xmath62 decays at least as fast as @xmath66 .",
    "comparing the expansion ( [ eq - y4exp ] ) with ( [ eq - vsol ] ) one sees that by choosing @xmath67 , one can get rid of all terms which decay slower than @xmath68 . by looking at gauge - invariant expressions",
    ", we will show later that this choice is indeed necessary in order to get an asymptotic flat solution .",
    "therefore , @xmath64 is fixed by physical means . the role of the constant @xmath65",
    "is discussed below .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have recently derived a gauge - invariant generalization of the zerilli equation which allows to study perturbations on a schwarzschild background written in any spherically symmetric coordinates . in appendix",
    "a of this paper we have written the perturbed metric in terms of the generalized zerilli function @xmath69 , that one obtains using the formalism of @xcite for the case at hand : @xmath70 , even parity perturbations of a ks background .",
    "this metric is a solution of einstein s vacuum equations provided the zerilli function @xmath71 satisfies @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and now @xmath75 , @xmath76 .    in order to evolve the ks initial data",
    ", we have to relate the amplitudes @xmath62 , @xmath49 and @xmath48 to the scalars @xmath71 and @xmath77 ( introduced in @xcite ) which satisfy the zerilli equation ( [ zerilli_equation ] ) . using the expansions ( [ eq - exp1],[eq - exp2 ] ) in the expressions ( [ eq - ksgk1],[eq - ksgk2 ] )",
    ", it is straightforward to calculate @xmath71 and @xmath77 using the formulae given in @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath78 \\ , , \\label{eq - psi}\\\\ \\dot{\\psi } & = & -\\mu\\left [ \\frac { 2x^3(2x - 1 ) \\hat{v } + x^4(x - 2 ) \\hat{v } ' + 6(x-1 ) } { 6x^2(2x+3 ) } \\right]\\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have also used ( [ eq - c2 ] ) in order to eliminate @xmath48 .",
    "since @xmath71 is gauge - invariant , it is clear that the free constants @xmath64 and @xmath65 appearing in @xmath79 can not represent a gauge freedom . in order to have an asymptotic flat solution , @xmath79 must vanish at infinity . as discussed in the previous subsection , this fixes the value of the constant @xmath64 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath77 fall off like @xmath66 at infinity .",
    "the constant @xmath65 is still free and will determine different sets of initial data as one chooses its value .",
    "the radiation content , as we will see , depends on @xmath65 .",
    "the constant is therefore clearly associated with the `` spurious radiation '' that the initial data contains with respect to `` astrophysically relevant '' initial data .",
    "one could probably determine this content by evolving the initial data set backwards in time .",
    "this calculation would be possible ( at least for a limited amount of time ) within the confines of the close approximation if the black holes are initially very close .",
    "one could therefore follow the space - time backwards for a short time and see if incoming radiation is present at a finite distance of the holes .",
    "we have not performed such a study , but it is feasible ( we thank jeff winicour for bringing this to our attention ) .",
    "it should be noticed that the initial data for the zerilli function diverges in the limit @xmath80 for all values of @xmath65 , so one can not single out a preferred value of this constant by demanding the initial data to be finite in this limit ( even though , as already mentioned , the multipole expansion is , in any case , valid only for @xmath81 ) .",
    "et al . _ have argued that the position of the apparent horizon is related to the constant @xmath65 .",
    "here we perform a linearized analysis of the position of the horizon , to clarify the meaning of their finding .",
    "given initial data @xmath82 , @xmath83 on a space - like slice @xmath84 , the location of an apparent horizon ( ah ) can be determined by the equation @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the unit outward normal to the ah . if the ah is given by @xmath87 for some function @xmath88 on @xmath84 , we have @xmath89 , where @xmath90 . for ks initial data of the form ( [ eq - ksgk1],[eq - ksgk2 ] ) ,",
    "it was assumed in @xcite that the ah coincides with a surface @xmath91 which is orthogonal to @xmath92 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath93 , and one can check that equation ( [ eq - ahf ] ) is compatible with the result in @xcite , i.e. @xmath91 is an ah if @xmath94 on @xmath91 .",
    "for spherically symmetric initial data , @xmath95 we must have @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and the ah equation ( [ eq - ahf ] ) yields @xmath98 .",
    "it is not difficult to show ( either by using the ks form of the schwarzschild metric or more generally by integrating the constraint equations ) that this is equivalent to @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the adm mass .",
    "we now want to linearize the ah equation around a spherically symmetric background and to find the deviation of the ah from @xmath99 . in the linear regime",
    ", we expect that the location of the ah can be described by the image of the circle @xmath101 under a map of the form @xmath102 the deviation function @xmath103 is related to the function @xmath104 as follows : @xmath105,\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is a function describing the ah to zeroth order ( for example @xmath107 ) .",
    "using also @xmath108 , we obtain @xmath109 .    on the other hand , for linear perturbations around a spherically symmetric background , the normalization of @xmath86 yields @xmath110",
    "while equation ( [ eq - ahf ] ) gives @xmath111 where @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are defined by @xmath116 in terms of the function @xmath88 , @xmath117 , and the linearized ah equation finally becomes @xmath118 performing a multipolar decomposition of @xmath103 , this equation becomes a set of algebraic equations for @xmath119 .",
    "evaluating for the ks data proposed in section ii a , we find that @xmath120    so we see that the position of the apparent horizon is given by the image of the circle @xmath121 under the map @xmath122 where the deviation function @xmath123 can be expressed algebraically in terms of the perturbed three metric and extrinsic curvature . for a ks metric and @xmath124 , @xmath125 it is now clear that the deviation function depends on the value of the constant @xmath126 .",
    "in particular , we can choose @xmath65 such that @xmath127 vanishes .    a way to see that the meaning of the constant @xmath65 is not just a choice in the position of the apparent horizon is to notice that once one has fixed the values of @xmath128 and @xmath129 , the ks form of the metric completely fixes the coordinates on the ks slice ( at least to linear order ) .",
    "indeed , a gauge mode must satisfy the constraint equations ( [ eq - c1],[eq - c2],[eq - c3 ] ) . on the other hand , the general solution to these equations",
    "is completely determined by @xmath79 , which can not contain gauge modes since it is related to the gauge - invariant amplitude @xmath71 according to ( [ eq - psi ] ) .",
    "therefore , we have two possibilities to fix the coordinate location of the apparent horizon ( at @xmath124 , say ) : the first possibility is to perform an infinitesimal coordinate transformation such that the apparent horizon appears unperturbed relative to the schwarzschild horizon . in this case , the initial data will not have ks form anymore .",
    "the second possibility is to adjust the constant @xmath65 such that the apparent horizon is at the location we desire . clearly , these two methods are different since the former corresponds to a gauge transformation , while the latter corresponds to a true physical change in the initial data , as we anticipated before .",
    "so indeed the constant @xmath65 is related to the position of the apparent horizon as was noticed by bishop _",
    "et al . _ , but through a genuine change ( not just a gauge change ) in the initial data .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the initial data for the zerilli function and its time derivative for different values of @xmath65 . in the next section",
    "we shall analyze the dependence of the total radiated energy and waveforms on @xmath65 .",
    "an expression for the radiated energy in terms of gauge - invariant quantities is given in @xcite .",
    "since here we have expanded all perturbations with respect to the legendre polynomial @xmath130 , this energy expression becomes @xmath131 with @xmath132 being evaluated in the radiative zone .",
    "we have written a code that solves our generalized regge - wheeler and zerilli equations . as a consistency check ,",
    "we have evolved the close limit of some maximally sliced initial data ( which can be seen as perturbations of schwarzschild in usual coordinates ) , being able to reproduce previous values for the total radiated energy ( e.g. misner s initial data @xcite , or boosted black holes @xcite ) .",
    "the code is a standard second order dissipative , finite differencing , one . in the case of a ks background",
    "we perform excision , i.e. we place the inner boundary inside the black hole , and in that way avoid giving boundary conditions there . in figure 3",
    "we show the zerilli function , scaled by @xmath133 ( i.e. @xmath134 ) versus time , extracted at @xmath135 for two different values of @xmath65 . from that plot",
    "one can notice , for example , the typical ringing frequency for schwarzschild black holes .",
    "given the linearity of zerilli s equation , and the form of the ks initial data , the dependence of the zerilli function on the parameters of the problem is @xmath136 where the functions @xmath137 and @xmath138 are dimensionless .",
    "accordingly , the total radiated energy is @xmath139 therefore one needs to perform only three runs to obtain the complete dependence of the radiated energy on the free parameters .",
    "the result is @xmath140 the quantity @xmath141 , as a ( quadratic ) function of @xmath65 , has a local minimum at @xmath142 , where it takes the value @xmath143 .",
    "this function is plotted in figure 3 .",
    "we have evolved the initial value family of bishop _",
    "et al . _ in the limit in which the black holes are close to each other by treating the spacetime as a single distorted kerr  schild black hole and solving the linearized einstein equations for the distortion .",
    "the evolution sheds further light on the role of the integration constants present in the family .",
    "an obvious question to ask would be `` does this family contain more / less radiation than other families '' ( for instance the misner data ) .",
    "unfortunately , the family has explicit free parameters and therefore the comparison is highly dependent on the arbitrary values of these parameters .",
    "this should not be misinterpreted as a problem : it just highlights that the initial value problem for binary black holes inevitably contains ambiguities .",
    "some proposals may resolve the ambiguities based on aesthetic criteria , but from a physical point of view that is not more satisfactory than simply picking values for the constants involved .",
    "these issues could be better understood if one evolved the systems backwards in time and tried to establish the amount of incoming radiation .",
    "the present results should be of interest in the calibration of numerical codes based on the kerr - schild coordinate system .",
    "experiments with the maya binary black hole code @xcite to compare results are currently under way .    this work was supported in part by the swiss national science foundation , by grants nsf - phy-0090091 , nsf - phy-9800973 , by fundacin antorchas , by the eberly family research fund at penn state and the horace c. hearne jr .",
