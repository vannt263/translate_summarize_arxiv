    "according to the famous dictum of gravity / gauge theory duality or maldacena s anti de sitter ( ads ) conformal field theory ( cft ) correspondence  @xcite , an ads space with a black hole is dual to a field theory at a finite temperature .",
    "ads / cft has been an excellent tool to study not only strongly coupled gauge theories at a large t hooft coupling limit but also to study hydrodynamic properties of a certain class of boundary cfts at a finite temperature .",
    "one of the highly celebrated results over the last decade is that , for a large class of four - dimensional cfts , the ratio of the shear viscosity @xmath4 to the entropy density @xmath5 is ( in units @xmath6 ) given by  @xcite @xmath7 this result has been known to hold for all gauge theories with einstein gravity dual .",
    "this is due to the fact that in pure einstein gravity all black holes satisfy the bekenstein - hawking entropy law or the area formula of black hole entropy @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the planck constant , @xmath10 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath11 is the area of the ( black hole ) horizon corresponding to the surface at @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the newton s constant @xmath13 . in general gravity theories with higher derivative or higher - curvature corrections , however , the ratio @xmath2 can be different from @xmath3 . in the same context ,",
    "a violation of causality might occur in the boundary cft when @xmath2 is too low ( @xmath14 ) . here",
    "we shall argue that any such a violation of micro - causality can be related to a violation of black hole entropy bounds or a violation of certain laws of black hole thermodynamics .    to show that this might be the case , and also to establish better contact with qcd via ads holography , in a holographic context ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , one might like to consider the following gravitational action @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a dimensionless coupling and @xmath17 is a bulk cosmological term .",
    "in fact , the regge slope or the coefficient @xmath16 appearing in the effective action  ( [ main - action ] ) can be a complicated function of some microscopic parameters of the quantum gravity theory , which may even depend on the details of compactification and on dilaton couplings .",
    "nevertheless , in the simplest scenario to be considered in this paper , one would assume that @xmath18 .",
    "here one might also note that , especially , in an ads@xmath19 space , the coefficients of @xmath20 terms in a dual supergravity action are determined by the central charges of a cft in four dimensions .    in most of our discussions we will focus to the gravity sector in a five - dimensional ads space , for which we have from the ads / cft correspondence , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the string scale and @xmath24 the string coupling and nc is the number of color charges or rank of the gauge group . in the dual supergravity description ,",
    "a small @xmath16 corresponds to the strong coupling limit , i.e. , @xmath25 , since @xmath26 .",
    "the gauss - bonnet term is obtained by setting @xmath27 and @xmath28 in ( [ main - action ] ) , for which there would be no need to treat @xmath16 as small , at least , for the purpose of obtaining exact ( black hole ) solutions  @xcite .",
    "recently , kats and petrov  @xcite and brigante et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that , for a class of cfts in flat space with gauss - bonnet gravity dual , the ratio @xmath2 , which reads @xmath29 where @xmath30 , can be smaller than @xmath3 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 . based on the bulk causal structure of an ads@xmath19 black brane solution , one may actually find an even more stronger bound for @xmath33 , that is , @xmath34 which otherwise violates a microcausality in the dual cft defined on a flat space . here",
    "we show that the critical value of @xmath33 beyond which the theory becomes inconsistent is related to the entropy bound for a large class of ads black holes .",
    "in fact , in the holographic context , ads black hole solutions with spherical and hyperbolic event horizons allow much wider possibilities for @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "it is quite plausible that in the presence of curvature terms like @xmath35 with @xmath36 , which generate six and higher derivatives in the metric , or the @xmath37 terms arising as @xmath38 corrections to low energy effective action of type iib string theory , the ratio @xmath2 takes a value slightly larger than @xmath3 ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "however , in any consistent gravity models , interaction terms like @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , must be suppressed in a sensible derivative expansion , implying that such corrections could arise only as subleading or next - to - subleading terms . here",
    "we show that when an underlying theory admits a large violation of the conjectured kss bound @xmath41 or the ratio @xmath2 becomes too small , then certain laws of thermodynamics can be violated in the same limit .",
    "this effect can be seen also in terms of a violation of causality in the boundary field theory .",
    "the bound @xmath42 may be restored only at weak couplings or in the limit of large @xmath43 , since in such cases the shear viscosity can grow faster as compared to the entropy density .",
    "for an ads gb black hole , the entropy and hawking temperature are given by  @xcite @xmath44 ( in units @xmath45 ) where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , with @xmath48 being the unit volume of the base manifold or the hypersurface @xmath49 .",
    "the entropy of a gb black hole depends on the curvature constant @xmath50 , whose value determines the geometry of the event horizon @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , for @xmath53 and @xmath54  , especially , with a constant coupling , @xmath55 , so we take @xmath32 . ] .",
    "especially , at the @xmath54 extremal state with zero temperature , @xmath56 thus , beyond a critical coupling @xmath57 , the entropy @xmath58 becomes negative , which indicates a violation of cosmic censorship or the second law of the thermodynamics . in the ads@xmath19 case , @xmath59 .",
    "this critical value of @xmath33 above which the theory is inconsistent nearly coincides with the bound @xmath60 required for a consistent formulation of a class of cfts in a flat space with gauss - bonnet gravity dual .    to be more specific ,",
    "let us consider small metric fluctuations @xmath61 around an ads gb black hole metric  , using @xmath62 to denote this perturbation with one index raised @xmath63 and writing @xmath62 in the basis @xmath64 . ]",
    "@xmath65    where @xmath66 and @xmath67^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath68 is the curvature of ads@xmath19 space .",
    "the scalar metric fluctuation ( along the @xmath69 direction ) @xmath70 ( where @xmath71 ) satisfies the following ( linearized ) equation of motion @xmath72 this structure is not affected by maxwell type charges but it may well be affected by dilatonic scalar charges and rotation parameters . in the simplest scenario",
    "one may neglect both the scalar charge and rotation parameters .",
    "in pure gb gravity defined on an ads@xmath19 spacetime , we find @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75,\\ ] ] where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "( [ linear - eq ] ) may be solved with the following incoming boundary conditions at the horizon @xmath81 where @xmath82 is an infinitesimal boundary source for the fluctuating field @xmath62 . to the leading order in @xmath83 , and in the limit @xmath84 ,",
    "the solution is given by  @xcite @xmath85.\\ ] ] by identifying @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is a component of the energy - momentum tensor on the field theory side , we may obtain the retarded two - point green s function . indeed , gb black holes admit a stable five - dimensional anti - de sitter vacuum only if @xmath88  @xcite .",
    "this result is independent of the types of interactions the gauss - bonnet term can have with matter fields ( including gauge and scalar fields ) .    from the above result",
    ", we can easily see that the curvature on a boundary may not affect the shear viscosity @xmath89 obtained using the kubo formula @xmath90 \\equiv \\lim_{w\\to 0 } \\frac{1}{w } { \\rm i m } g^r_{12 , 12 } ( w,0).\\ ] ] as is evident , this formula relates @xmath4 to zero spatial momentum ( @xmath91 ) , low frequency limit of the retarded two - point green s function @xmath92\\rangle,\\ ] ] which satisfies @xmath93 .",
    "the ratio @xmath2 is now modified as @xmath94 the standard result in einstein gravity , i.e. @xmath0 , is obtained only at a fixed @xmath95 , i.e. when @xmath54 and @xmath96 .",
    "the minimum of entropy density actually occurs at @xmath97 , implying that @xmath98 at this extremal state the shear viscosity is given by @xmath99 the positivity of extremal entropy density implies that @xmath100 and hence @xmath101 for the @xmath102 and @xmath103 for the @xmath54 solutions .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the lower bound found above , i.e. @xmath104 , is similar to a lower value of @xmath2 found at some relativistic heavy ion collision experiments  @xcite .",
    "the bound @xmath105 was found in  @xcite by considering a ricci flat horizon or assuming that the boundary theory is defined on a flat space . here",
    "we note that , in the @xmath106 case , the lower value of @xmath2 can be slightly stronger than that in flat space .",
    "especially , in a flat space , a non - violation of causality requires the square of local speed of graviton on a constant @xmath107-hypersurface to be less than unity , i.e. @xmath108 or @xmath109 .",
    "this limit can be slightly altered by the maxwell term @xmath110 and also by @xmath111 type corrections to maxwell fields  @xcite   as a function of @xmath112 , which is the case only with the gauss - bonnet gravity , then the perturbation of the transverse gravitons can get decoupled from the fluctuations of matter fields . ] .",
    "specifically , in the presence of a maxwell charge @xmath113 , the ratio @xmath2 is given by @xmath114 , where @xmath115 . in the standard case of an non - extremal black hole one may be required to satisfy two separate conditions @xmath116 and @xmath117 , leading to the bound @xmath118 as first reported in  @xcite .    for the consistency of a dual gauss - bonnet gravity action , and also from a viewpoint of classical stability of gb black holes ,",
    "one is required to take @xmath119 respectively , in the ads@xmath120 and the ads@xmath121 cases .",
    "next let us briefly discuss the results in the @xmath1 gravity , which is obtained by setting @xmath122 and @xmath123 in eq .",
    "( [ main - action ] ) . in this theory",
    ", we find  @xcite   should be corrected by a factor of 2 : the source of this difference is that in @xmath1 gravity the entropy function is increased by a factor of @xmath124 , in the case of a ricci - flat horizon , which was however not considered there . ]",
    "@xmath125 this result shows that the kss bound @xmath126 can be violated for a finite @xmath127 , unless that the contribution to @xmath2 coming from next - to - leading order terms , such as @xmath128 terms , are of a comparable magnitude to that of the @xmath20 terms .",
    "this scenario is , however , almost unlikely since the couplings associated with the cubic and higher powers in riemann tensors , such as @xmath39 with @xmath129 , must be suppressed in a sensible derivative expansion .",
    "notice that the limit @xmath130 , as implied by eq .",
    "( [ main - sqrm ] ) and required for positivity of @xmath2 , is the same as implied by the positivity of extremal entropy of a @xmath1-corrected ads black hole .",
    "this result is consistent with the following observation .",
    "the conformal anomaly of a four - dimensional cft can be identified by considering the theory in a curved spacetime and writing @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 are , respectively , the four - dimensional euler density and the square of the weyl curvature , and @xmath134 , @xmath135 are the two central charges of a dual cft . as explained by hofman and maldacena in  @xcite",
    "( see also  @xcite ) , for the consistency of a low energy action with sensible derivative expansion , one may be required to consider cfts for which @xmath136 in fact , the gravity dual of a class of cfts for which @xmath137 , must be defined in a curved background , so the choice @xmath102 may not be very physical , at least , in the presence of @xmath1 type corrections",
    ".    taking into account all three possibilities for the boundary topology that @xmath102 or @xmath138 , and demanding that @xmath139 , we find @xmath140 it is not known yet whether either of these limits applies to nuclear matters at extreme densities and temperatures , or heavy ion collision experiments , but it would be interesting to know anything specific to the universality of the result @xmath141 through numerical hydrodynamic simulations of data from high energy experiments , including the relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) and large hadron collider .",
    "recent developments in gravity / gauge theory duality , supersymmetric field theories and black hole mechanics have shown that ads black holes are excellent objects to study the properties of strongly coupled gauge theories . in this note",
    "we have studied the limits on black hole entropy and shear viscosity for the simplest class of higher curvature - corrected black hole solutions defined on ads spaces .",
    "we also considered the causal problem on the boundary field theory to see what kind of constraints we can get on the ratio @xmath2 ( where @xmath4 is the shear viscosity and @xmath5 is the entropy density ) so as to keep the theory phenomenologically viable and internally consistent .",
    "it has been known for quite sometimes that the limit @xmath142 on the gauss - bonnet coupling can be viewed as a classical limit of a consistent theory of quantum gravity  @xcite .",
    "recent results coming from the studies of viscosity bound violation in higher curvature gravity  @xcite have shown that the bound on the shear viscosity of any fluid in terms of its entropy density may be saturated , i.e. @xmath0 , by all gauge theories but only at large t hooft coupling , as this limit correspond to the cases where all higher - order curvature contributions are absent .",
    "nevertheless , this bound is naturally in immediate threat of being violated in the presence of generic higher derivative and higher - order curvature corrections to the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "it is important to note that by tuning of the gauss - bonnet coupling or the generic higher derivative couplings , the ratio @xmath2 can be adjusted to a small positive value .",
    "causality violation might take place when @xmath2 is too low , i.e. @xmath143 .",
    "we have shown that limits on curvature coupling can be imposed by demanding the positivity of extremal black hole entropy or by keeping boundary causality in tact , or both .",
    "we have not found any obvious explicit bound on @xmath33 from the thermodynamics of spherically symmetric ads gauss - bonnet black holes .",
    "this could however arise as a consequence of causality violation of a boundary cft .",
    "the critical value of @xmath33 beyond which the theory becomes inconsistent is found to be related to the entropy bound for an ads gb black hole with a hyperbolic or euclidean anti - de sitter event horizon .",
    "this remark applies also to the @xmath1 gravity .",
    "some other inconsistencies of higher - derivative gravity , such as an appearance of tacyonic mode , or semi - classical instability at short distances , can also be related to classical limits on black hole entropy and viscosity bounds .",
    "we conclude with a couple of remarks . in the presence of a maxwell type charge @xmath113 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath2 is generally modified , which is given by @xmath144 , where @xmath145 . in the extremal limit ( @xmath146 )",
    ", we put a restriction on the coupling @xmath33 such that @xmath147 , which guarantees that the gravitational potential of a black brane is positive and bounded .",
    "the kss bound @xmath41 is saturated only in the extremal limit , while in general it is violated also by charged gauss - bonnet black brane solutions .",
    "the bound @xmath148 found in  @xcite with a nonzero charge is stronger than for pure einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity in flat space , namely @xmath149 .",
    "our analysis showed that in the ads@xmath19 case , the entropy of a gb black hole could be negative for @xmath150 , leading to a possible violation of unitarity in this range .",
    "as shown recently in  @xcite , a scalar dilaton field coupled to the gauss - bonnet can have an additional non - trivial contribution to the ratio @xmath2 : a scalar charge generally lowers the kss bound . in some more recent papers  @xcite , there have appeared new examples , including string theory constructions , where the standard result of einstein gravity , namely @xmath0 , is modified in a modest way .",
