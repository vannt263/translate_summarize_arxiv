    "modern understanding of polymer liquids relies heavily on the study of highly simplified models , and of theories that predict highly universal behavior .",
    "the best developed example of this is the theory of dilute and semidilute polymer solutions in good solvent @xcite . experiments and simulations in this regime",
    "are well described by a scaling theory that predicts a universal dependence on only two dimensionless parameters , which measure the extent of overlap and the strength of the bare repulsion per chain .",
    "the theory is based on an analysis of a highly simplified model , due to edwards @xcite , of polymers as continuous random walks with a short - ranged repulsion between segments .",
    "perhaps the most important step in testing this theory was the demonstration that experimental data for polymer solutions is consistent with the scaling hypothesis , which was achieved by comparing data from a variety of chemical systems , over a range of conditions and chain lengths @xcite .",
    "we are interested here in dense polymer liquids , such as block copolymer melts and polymer blends , rather than solutions . coarse - grained theories of these systems are based on a simple generalization of the edwards model . to describe dense liquids ,",
    "the model is studied in a nearly - incompressible limit in which density fluctuations are strongly suppressed .",
    "following matsen , we will refer to this as the `` standard model '' @xcite for this class of liquids .",
    "the purpose of the current paper is to verify a scaling hypothesis suggested by a long series @xcite of theoretical studies on this model , which predict behavior that depends only on the parameters required as inputs to self - consistent field theory and one additional parameter , @xmath5 , which is a measure of overlap .",
    "specifically , we test a prediction that the structure factor @xmath4 in disordered symmetric diblock copolymer melts should exhibit a universal dependence on two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , independent of many details of different simulation models and experimental systems .",
    "this is tested by comparing simulation results for @xmath4 obtained from several different simulation models over a range of chain lengths and parameter values .",
    "the vast majority of theoretical work on block copolymers and polymer mixtures has thus far been based on the self - consistent field ( scf ) approximation @xcite .",
    "self - consistent field theory ( scft ) is a coarse - grained density functional theory that expresses the free energy functional of an inhomogeneous polymer liquid as a sum of the free energy of an inhomogeneous ideal gas of random - walk polymers and an excess free energy , and in which the excess free energy is taken to be a local functional of composition . in the simplest and most common form of the theory , for systems with two types of monomers a and b ,",
    "the excess free energy per monomer @xmath6 is taken to be a function @xmath7 , in which @xmath8 represents the local average volume fraction of @xmath9 monomers , and @xmath2 is the flory - huggins interaction parameter .",
    "scf theory predicts a universal dependence of all equilibrium properties on a small set of dimensionless parameters . in systems with two types of monomer , such as diblock copolymer melts and binary polymer blends , scf predictions all depend on a product @xmath0 that quantifies the excess free energy of mixing per chain , where @xmath3 is a degree of polymerization .",
    "other relevant parameters include ratios of chain and block lengths , macroscopic composition ( in polymer mixtures ) , and ratios of statistical segment lengths or radii of gyrations .",
    "thus , for example , for idealized diblock copolymer melts with monomers of equal statistical segment lengths @xmath10 , scft predicts a universal phase diagram @xcite that depends on only @xmath0 and the volume fraction @xmath11 of the @xmath12 block .",
    "we focus in this contribution on the behavior of the structure factor @xmath4 in simulations of symmetric diblock copolymer melts .",
    "@xmath4 is a correlation function for composition fluctuations , defined by @xmath13 where @xmath14/2 $ ] is a composition field . here",
    ", @xmath15 is a deviation of the number concentration of @xmath9 monomers from the spatial average value @xmath16 ( @xmath17 : total average monomer concentration ) .",
    "it is possible to use the scf approximation to calculate @xmath4 , by employing the relationship between correlation functions and functional derivatives of @xmath18 .",
    "this yields the so - called random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite .",
    "the rpa yields a prediction for the quantity @xmath19 in symmetric diblock copolymer melts of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a known analytic function , @xmath22 is the unperturbed radius of gyration , and @xmath23 is an effective interaction parameter . in the most general form of scft , the effective interaction parameter that appears in the rpa",
    "is given by a derivative @xmath24 of the scf excess free energy per monomer .",
    "in the special case of symmetric diblock copolymer melts , the rpa thus predicts that @xmath4 depends on one non - dimensionalized wavenumber @xmath25 and a single thermodynamic parameter @xmath26 .    in any theory that is based on the standard model , physical predictions must be invariant under changes in how we define `` monomer '' .",
    "the standard model is based upon a description of polymer conformations as idealized fractals ( wiener processes ) , with no chemical microstructure .",
    "as such , the definition of a monomer , or the number n of monomers per chain , is arbitrary .",
    "consequently , all scf and rpa predictions can be expressed as relationships among dimensionless quantities that are invariant in this sense . among such invariants",
    "are the product @xmath26 , which is a measure of excess free energy per chain for transferring an a chain of @xmath3 monomers into a b - rich environment , the invariant scattering intensity @xmath27 , and quantities such as @xmath28 in which a length scale is non - dimensionalized by comparing it to a measure of the coil size .",
    "this invariance principle also , however , admits one parameter that does not appear in scft predictions ( except as a trivial prefactor in expressions for total free energy ) , which is a measure of dimensionless concentration . in an incompressible one - component liquid of chains of length @xmath3 , with a monomer concentration @xmath17 and a polymer concentration @xmath29 , we may define an invariant concentration @xmath30 which is the number of chains in a volume @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a random - walk approximation for the root - mean - squared end - to - end length .",
    "alternatively , following fredrickson and helfand @xcite , we may define an `` invariant degree of polymerization '' @xmath33 we use @xmath34 to define @xmath35 and @xmath1 , rather than the radius of gyration or some other measure of coil size , simply for consistency with the definition of @xmath1 used in previous work @xcite .",
    "this choice is arbitrary .",
    "notably , scf predictions depend non - trivially upon all of the dimensionless parameters that are allowed by the invariance principle _ except _ the parameter @xmath35 or @xmath1 .",
    "the predicted absence of any dependence on @xmath1 is a peculiarity of the scf approximation .",
    "a series of closely related one - loop theories @xcite of the standard model , which go beyond the scf approximation , all yield predictions that depend upon @xmath1 as well as the parameters that appear in scf predictions .",
    "moreover , these theories all predict results that reduce to corresponding scf or rpa predictions in the limit @xmath36 .",
    "these studies thus suggest that the scf approximation is exact in the limit of infinitely strongly overlapping chains , but not finite chains . for symmetric diblock",
    "copolymer melts , the renormalized one - loop ( rol ) theory predicts a structure factor that is given by a universal function @xmath37 of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath1 , where @xmath38 .",
    "the renormalized one - loop theory @xcite yields an explicit prediction in which the function @xmath39 is given as the sum of an rpa prediction ( the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sqrpa ] ) with renormalized values of @xmath23 and @xmath40 , plus a correction that is proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "one - loop theories of fluctuations predict @xmath42 corrections to scf predictions appear in many other quantities , including the critical region for polymer blends and corrections to the random walk statistics .",
    "it appears that this one - loop correction is simply the first term in a renormalized loop expansion of corrections to rpa and scf predictions that ( if pursued further ) would yield a taylor expansion of @xmath43 in powers of @xmath41 , in which the rol theory for @xmath4 retains only the first two terms @xcite .",
    "we thus expect the existence of a scaling relation of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sq ] ) to have a wider range of validity than the one - loop approximation .    extensive simulations of diblock copolymer melts have been carried out previously using a variety of coarse - grained lattice and continuum models .",
    "the use of coarse - grained models for this purpose presumes a high degree of universality , both among different simulation models and between coarse - grained simulations and experiments .",
    "because none of these coarse - grained models provide an accurate representation of any real polymer liquid , it would be pointless to study them unless one believes that the equivalent behavior can be obtained from corresponding states of models or physical systems that differ in many details .",
    "the goal of the present contribution is to test the extent to which data for @xmath4 from several different simulation models of diblock copolymers is consistent with the existence of a universal function of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sq ] ) .",
    "the scaling hypothesis of eq . ( [ eq : sq ] ) simply postulates that the invariant scattering intensity @xmath44 exhibits a universal dependence upon all of the invariant dimensionless parameters that appear in the standard model . as such , a test of the adequacy of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sq ] ) is also a test of the adequacy of the standard model as a generic description of models and experimental systems that differ in many microscopic details .",
    "we have studied three coarse - grained models .",
    "the first model is a lattice bond fluctuation model , which has been described in refs .",
    "the second is a bead - spring model with a steeply repulsive weeks - chandler - anderson ( wca ) pair repulsion , similar to that used by kremer and grest @xcite .",
    "the third is a bead - spring model with a much softer pair interaction that allows monomers to overlap @xcite .",
    "we will refer to these models in what follows as models l (  lattice \" ) , h (  hard \" ) , and s (  soft \" ) , respectively .",
    "model l ( the bond fluctuation model ) is based on a cubic lattice , with a lattice spacing @xmath45 , in which each monomer occupies ( i.e. , excludes other monomers from ) the eight lattice sites of a cube of volume @xmath46 .",
    "the bond between consecutive monomers along a chain is allowed to have any of @xmath47 vectors with lengths up to @xmath48 , excluding the vector of length @xmath49 in the @xmath50 direction to avoid bond crossing .",

    "theories that are based on the highly idealized standard model of polymer liquids implicitly assume the validity of a principle of corresponding states : they presume that equivalent behavior should be obtained from simulations and experimental systems that can differ in many microscopic details , as long as we compare systems with equal values for all of the dimensionless parameters that appear in the standard model .",
    "the work presented here is motivated by the observation that this is a testable scaling hypothesis , and which can be tested without reference to any quantitative theory , by comparing results of different simulation models . in this paper , we have tested this scaling hypothesis by comparing results for the structure function @xmath4 from three substantially different simulation models of symmetric diblock polymer melts .",
    "the results strongly support the scaling hypothesis .",
    "the main conceptual difficulty that had to be overcome was the fact that the hypothesis allows all of the quantities of interest to exhibit an unknown dependence on a phenomenological interaction parameter that is an unknown , model - dependent function of the parameters that one can control in a simulation .",
    "we devised two tests of universality that did not require knowledge of this dependence .",
    "the first of these involved a comparison of the relationship between two observable quantities , the peak wavenumber and the peak intensity .",
    "the second involved a test of whether the data for peak intensity from different models could be collapsed by searching for an @xmath3-independent mapping between corresponding values of the control parameters in different models .",
    "we believe that analogous methods of analyzing data may be useful for analysis of experimental data . in order to compare to experiments",
    ", however , it may be important useful to allow for the effects of various types of asymmetry that are not present in these simulations .",
    "our results strongly support the scaling hypothesis .",
    "results for the peak position and peak intensity from three substantially different models were found to exhibit almost perfect universality . for comparisons involving model",
    "s , this was found even for surprisingly short chains , with as few as @xmath174 monomers .",
    "notably , the level of agreement between different models for the relationship between the peak wavenumber and peak intensity was substantially better than the already rather good agreement obtained between results of model h and the rol theory @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the accuracy of the scaling hypothesis is a measure of the accuracy of the standard model itself , which should have a wider range of validity than the one - loop approximation for this model .",
    "we emphasize that the goal of this paper was not to test the accuracy of a particular theory for @xmath4 or other equilibrium properties .",
    "nothing in the analysis presented here referred to a specific theory .",
    "instead , we sought to test whether it was possible for _ any _ coarse - grained theory based on the standard model to describe the data from different simulation models .",
    "one consequence of this approach is that our analysis did not yield estimates the interaction parameter @xmath175 for any of the models that we have studied .",
    "the only way to obtain an estimate of @xmath175 for a particular model or experimental system is to compare simulation or experimental results to a quantitative theory .",
    "the quality of the resulting estimate can , of course , be no better than the quality of the theory upon which it is based .",
    "the analysis presented here shows only that it is possible to construct a theory ( or simply a set of empirical correlations ) that can describe a variety of simulation models .",
    "the scaling hypothesis that we discuss here can be easily generalized to ordered phases of block copolymer melts , and to other types of dense polymer liquids , such as polymer mixtures . in future work",
    ", we plan to extend this analysis so as to test the universality of behavior in the vicinity of the order - disorder transition of diblock copolymer melts , and in the ordered phases .",
    "the hypothesis that we tested here is intentionally very simple , in that it allows physical properties to depend only on the variables that appear explicitly in the standard model .",
    "it neglects a variety of phenomena that could lead to non - universal deviations from scaling in more realistic models and in experimental systems . among these",
    "are the possible existence of a square - gradient corrections to the local excess free energy , leading to a non - universal @xmath176 contribution to @xmath177 , and the possibility of special corrections to the excess free energy arising from chain ends and junctions , as discussed in ref .",
    "the fact that the scaling hypothesis holds to very high accuracy in the models studied here implies , however , that such non - universal corrections must be very small in this particular set of models .",
    "this is encouraging , but it remains to be seen how large may be the deviations from scaling in other simulation models , and in experiments .",
    "the type of analysis presented here is , however , the natural starting point for quantifying any such deviations .",
