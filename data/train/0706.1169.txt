    "wireless multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems offer the possibility to increase data rate over conventional wireless communications without need for more physical radio spectrum by means of multiple antenna elements at both transmitter and receiver side .",
    "since the pioneering work in the field @xcite , countless implementations for those mimo systems have been proposed .",
    "they can be classified by the side where the signal processing takes place .",
    "depending on the proposed system solution , there can be need for major signal processing at the receiver side , the transmitter side or both of them .",
    "this work is concerned with systems where sophisticated signal processing is required solely at the transmitter side .",
    "this is advantageous for transmitting data to low - cost or battery - driven devices such as cell - phones and pdas .",
    "it is an unavoidable feature of wireless mimo systems that signals sent at different antenna elements of the transmit array are received with severe crosstalk at the respective antenna elements of the receive array . in order to compensate for this crosstalk",
    ", one can use linear joint transmitter processing , also known as linear vector precoding , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "this comes , however , at the expense of the need for an increased transmit power in order to maintain the distance properties of the signal constellation .",
    "a more sophisticated method for transmitter processing is nonlinear vector precoding , in this work simply referred to as vector precoding .",
    "it is based on the concept of tomlinson - harashima preecoding @xcite which was originally proposed to combat intersymbol interference .",
    "it was proposed for use in context of mimo systems in @xcite . for a general survey on vector precoding the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we are mainly concerned with the performance analysis of vector precoding . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is no published literature on the performance analysis of nonlinear vector precoding by analytical means .",
    "this paper aims to pave the way a first step forward towards this direction employing the replica method which was originally invented for the analysis of spin glasses in statistical physics @xcite and has become increasingly powerful to address problems in wireless communications and coding theory @xcite .",
    "we use the analytical results developed in this paper to compare real - valued vector precoding with complex - valued vector precoding as well as with some hybrid forms of it which are newly proposed in this work .",
    "the paper is composed of five more sections .",
    "section  [ vp ] introduces vector precoding from a general point of view .",
    "this point of view is more general than the way vector precoding is dealt with in the references mentioned earlier , but it is well suited to the replica analysis to follow .",
    "section  [ ps ] formulates vector precoding as a non - convex quadratic programming problem and introduces the technical assumptions that we require for the analytical analysis .",
    "section  [ gr ] derives the general replica symmetric solution to any non - convex quadratic programming problem for which the search space can be factorized into kronecker products of scalar sets in the limit of a large number of dimensions of the search space .",
    "section  [ pr ] specializes the general results to mimo channels with channel matrices composed of independent identically distributed entries and various choices for the relaxation of the symbol alphabet .",
    "section  [ c ] summarizes the main conclusions .",
    "particularly technical derivations are placed in the two appendices .",
    "vector precoding aims to minimize the transmitted power that is associated with the transmission of a certain data vector @xmath0 of length @xmath1 . for that purpose",
    ", the original symbol alphabet @xmath2 is relaxed into the alphabet @xmath3 .",
    "the data representation in the relaxed alphabet is redundant .",
    "that means that several symbols in the relaxed alphabet represent the same data .",
    "due to the redundant representation , we can now choose that representation of our data which requires the least power to be transmitted .",
    "this way of saving transmit power is what we call vector precoding .",
    "that means , for any @xmath4 there is a set @xmath5 such that all elements of @xmath6 represent the data @xmath7 .",
    "take binary transmission as an example , i.e.  @xmath8 . without vector precoding ,",
    "it is most common to choose @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this modulation is called binary phase shift keying . for binary modulation ,",
    "vector precoding is the idea to have @xmath11 and @xmath12 , i.e.  to allow for supersets of the binary constellation .",
    "a popular choice for those supersets is due to tomlinson and harashima @xcite , see also fig .",
    "[ 1dlattice ] .    here",
    ", we have @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "in order to avoid ambiguities , we should have @xmath15 in addition , one would like to design the sets @xmath16 such that the distance properties between the presented information are preserved .",
    "this is easily achieved by letting the sets @xmath17 to be distinct sub - lattices of @xmath18 .",
    "however , we are not concerned with these design issues here .",
    "we aim to analyze the power saving achieved by a particular choice of the sets @xmath17 .",
    "this goal is achieved using the replica method invented in statistical physics .",
    "let @xmath19^{\\rm t}$ ] denote the information to be encoded .",
    "let @xmath20 be the vector being sent .",
    "then , the precoding problem can be written as the minimization of the following quadratic form @xmath21 over the discrete set @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "this type of problem is known in context of optimization as non - convex quadratic programming .    in order to allow for analytical tractability",
    ", we need the follwing definition and assumptions :    let @xmath24 denote an arbitrary probability distribution .",
    "let @xmath25 then , the r - transform of @xmath24 is @xmath26 with @xmath27 denoting the inverse of @xmath28 with respect to composition , i.e.  @xmath29 .",
    "we have @xmath30 for all @xmath31 , i.e.  convergence in probability .    for all @xmath32 ,",
    "the continuation of the function @xmath33 onto the positive real line is equal to @xmath34 in the right - sided vicinity of @xmath35 .",
    "the random matrix @xmath36 , can be decomposed into @xmath37 such that the matrices @xmath38 and @xmath39 are diagonal and haar distributed , respectively .",
    "moreover , as @xmath40 , the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of @xmath36 converges to a non - random distribution function which can be uniquely characterized by its r - transform @xmath41 .",
    "when applying the replica method to solve the saddle - point equations , we will assume that the extremal point is invariant to permutations of the replica index .",
    "for a detailed discussion of replica symmetry , the reader is referred to the literature of spin glasses , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the first three assumptions are rather technical and should hold well in the application we are addressing .",
    "the validity of replica symmetry for the minimum value of @xmath42 is an approximation , which is made for analytical tractability and , for sake of simplicity , no further justification is made here .",
    "it should be pointed out though that , even when replica symmetry is not valid the correct value of quantities such as @xmath43 do not differ much from the corresponding values evaluated within the replica - symmetric assumption , cf.@xcite .",
    "in this section , we derive a general solution to the non - convex quadratic programming problem ( [ qp ] ) in the limit of a large number of dimensions @xmath1 .",
    "we find the following result :    let assumptions 1 to 4 hold .",
    "let @xmath44 denote the limit of the empirical distribution function of the information symbols @xmath45 as @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , let the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 be solutions to the following pair of coupled fixed - point equations @xmath48 with @xmath49 being the complex gaussian measure . then , if @xmath50 , we have @xmath51 in probability as @xmath40 .",
    "the remainder of this section is dedicated to the derivation of proposition 1 .",
    "further sections will not make reference to the remainder of section  [ gr ] .    with assumptions 1 and 2 , we find for the average transmitted energy per symbol in the large system limit @xmath52 where the argument of the logarithm in ( [ eq518 ] ) is given by is used as shortcut for @xmath53 . ] @xmath54\\\\ & = & \\lim\\limits_{k\\to\\infty}\\frac1k\\log\\expect\\limits_{{\\mathlette{\\boldmath}{j } } } \\sum\\limits_{\\{{\\mathlette{\\boldmath}{x}}_a\\in { \\cal x}\\ } } \\exp\\left[{\\rm tr } \\left(-\\beta { \\mathlette{\\boldmath}{j } } \\sum\\limits_{a=1}^n { \\mathlette{\\boldmath}{x}}_a { \\mathlette{\\boldmath}{x}}_a^{\\dagger}\\right)\\right ] .",

    "this integration was studied by harish - chandra @xcite and itzykson & zuber @xcite in the mathematics and physics literature , respectively .",
    "it was applied in context of wireless communications in @xcite .",
    "guionnet and mada @xcite solve this integral in terms of the r - transform @xmath41 of the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of @xmath36 .",
    "following their approach yields @xmath55 \\label{intx}\\ ] ] with @xmath56 denoting the @xmath57 positive eigenvalues of @xmath58    the eigenvalues @xmath56 are completely determined by the inner products @xmath59    in order to perform the summation in ( [ intx ] ) , the @xmath60-dimensional space spanned by the replicas is split into subshells @xmath61 where the inner product of two different replicated vectors @xmath62 and @xmath63 is constant in each subshell .",

    "this procedure is a change of integration variables in multiple dimensions where the integration of an exponential function over the replicas has been replaced by integration over the variables @xmath70 . in the following the two exponential terms in ( [ domsh ] )",
    "are evaluated separately .",
    "first , we turn to the evaluation of the measure @xmath71 .",
    "the fourier expansion of the dirac measure @xmath72 \\frac{{\\rm d}\\tilde{q}_{ab}}{2{\\pi}{\\rm j}}\\ ] ] with @xmath73 , gives @xmath74 with @xmath75 in the limit of @xmath40 one of the exponential terms in ( [ domsh ] ) will dominate over all others .",
    "thus , only the maximum value of the correlation @xmath76 is relevant for calculation of the integral .    at this point , we assume replica symmetry .",
    "this means , that in order to find the maximum of the objective function , we consider only a subset of the potential possibilities that the variables @xmath76 could take . in particular , we are interested in the most general form of the positive semidefinite matrix @xmath77 with permutational symmetry when exchanging its replica indices . therefore , we need a matrix with all off - diagonal elements equal to each other . thus , we restrict them to the following two different possibilities @xmath78 and @xmath79 where @xmath80 since @xmath77 has to be positive semidefinite . one case distinction has been made to distinguish correlations @xmath76 which correspond to correlations between different and identical replica indices , respectively .",
    "we apply the same idea to the correlation variables in the dual ( fourier ) domain and set with a modest amount of foresight @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "note that despite the fact that @xmath77 is complex , in general , its values at the saddle - point are in fact real .    at this point",
    "the crucial benefit of the replica method becomes obvious .",
    "assuming replica continuity , we have managed to reduce the evaluation of a continuous function to sampling it at integer points . assuming replica symmetry we have reduced the task of evaluating infinitely many integer points to calculating four different correlations ( two in the original and two in the fourier domain ) .",
    "the assumption of replica symmetry leads to @xmath83 and @xmath84 note that the prior distribution enters the free energy only via ( [ lastmk ] ) .",
    "we will focus on this later on after having finished with the other terms .    for the evaluation of @xmath85 in ( [ domsh ] ) , we can use the replica symmetry to explicitly calculate the eigenvalues @xmath56 .",
    "considerations of linear algebra lead to the conclusion that the eigenvalues @xmath47 and @xmath86 occur with multiplicities @xmath87 and 1 , respectively .",
    "thus we get @xmath88 since the integral in ( [ domsh ] ) is dominated by the maximum argument of the exponential function , the derivatives of @xmath89 with respect to @xmath46 and @xmath47 must vanish as @xmath40 .",
    "is expressed in terms of @xmath90 , the relevant extremum is in fact a maximum and not a minimum .",
    "this is due to the fact that when drops below unity , the minima of a function become maxima and vice - versa . for a detailed analysis of this technicality ,",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "taking derivatives after plugging ( [ lineq ] ) and ( [ ext1 ] ) into ( [ tedr ] ) , gives @xmath91 solving for @xmath92 and @xmath93 gives @xmath94 with the limits for @xmath95 @xmath96    consider now the integration over the prior distribution in the moment - generating function .",
    "consider ( [ lastmk ] ) giving the only term that involves the prior distribution and apply the complex hubbard - stratonovich transform @xmath97 then , we find with ( [ lastmk ] ) @xmath98 moreover , for @xmath40 , we have by the law of large numbers @xmath99    in the large system limit , the integral in ( [ saddlemu ] ) is dominated by that value of the integration variable which maximizes the argument of the exponential function .",
    "thus , partial derivatives of @xmath100 with respect to @xmath93 and @xmath92 must vanish as @xmath40 .",
    "an explicit calculation of the two derivatives gives the following expressions for the macroscopic parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xmath101 moreover , we find @xmath102 finally , the fixed point equations ( [ theoq ] ) and ( [ theob ] ) simplify via the saddle point integration rule to ( [ theoq1 ] ) and ( [ theob1 ] ) .",
    "note that the minimization with respect to the symbol @xmath103 splits the integration space of @xmath104 into the voronoi regions defined by the ( appropriately scaled ) signal constellation @xmath6 .",
    "returning to our initial goal , the evaluation of the average transmitted energy per symbol , and collecting our previous results , we find @xmath105 now , we use lhospital s rule , re - substitute @xmath47 and @xmath46 , make use of @xmath106 and get ( [ theoes1 ] ) . note that for any bound on the amplitude of the signal set @xmath107 , the parameter @xmath46 is finite . even without bound",
    ", @xmath46 will remain finite for a well - defined minimization problem .",
    "the parameter @xmath47 behaves in a more complicated manner .",
    "it can be both zero , finite , and infinite as @xmath108 depending on the particular r - transform and the signal sets @xmath109 . for @xmath110",
    ", the saddle - point limits have to be re - considered .",
    "the general result leaves us with two components to specify : 1 ) the statistics of the random matrix entering the energy per symbol via its r - transform .",
    "2 ) the relaxed signal alphabets @xmath111 .",
    "while the relaxed alphabets characterize a particular method of precoding , the random matrix statistics depends on the wireless communication system . in the following",
    ", we will consider the following choice for the statistics of the random matrix .",
    "consider a vector - valued communication system .",
    "let the received vector be given as @xmath112 where @xmath113 is white gaussian noise .",
    "let the components of the transmitted and received vectors be signals sent and received at different antenna elements , respectively .",
    "we want to ensure that the received signal is ( up to additive noise ) identical to the data vector .",
    "this design criteria leads us to choose the precoding matrix @xmath114 this means that we invert the channel and get @xmath115 if the matrix inverse exists .",
    "this allows to keep the signal processing at the receiver at a minimum .",
    "this is advantageous if the receiver shall be a low - cost or battery - powered device .    to model the statistics of the entries of @xmath116",
    "is a non - trivial task and a topic of ongoing research , see e.g.@xcite and references therein . for sake of convenience ,",
    "we choose in this first order approach that the entries of the channel matrix @xmath116 are independent and identically distributed complex gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance @xmath117 .",
    "for that case , we find in the appendix that @xmath118 it also turns out helpful to recognize that @xmath119    in the following , we compare the performances of several constructions of the redundant signal re - presentations for the channel model specified above .      consider binary one - dimensional modulation .",
    "let @xmath120 this is the mathematical description of binary phase - shift keying on the real line in context of vector precoding .    using the specifications above",
    ", we find in the limit @xmath108",
    "@xmath121    moreover , let without loss of generality @xmath122 and @xmath123 this case describes tomlinson - harashima precoding @xcite with optimization over @xmath124 different representations for each information bit .",
    "an example of such a respresentation for integer lattice points is shown in fig .",
    "[ 1dlattice ] .",
    "the boundary points of the voronoi regions are @xmath125 and the fixed - point equations for @xmath46 and @xmath47 become @xmath126 with @xmath127 denoting the gaussian probability integral .",
    "for the case of no precoding at all , i.e.  @xmath128 , we get @xmath129    for the case of general @xmath124 , we first restrict to the special case of a square channel matrix .",

    "the gramian is only invertible for @xmath137 .",
    "however , the r - transform is well - defined for any positive aspect ratio . for singular random matrices ,",
    "the r - transform reflects the fact that the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution has some point mass at infinity .",
    "thus , we find @xmath138 it is convenient to replace the parameter @xmath47 by the substitution @xmath139 which gives @xmath140 and @xmath141 finally , combining the last three equations , we get @xmath142    the solutions of these fixed - point equations are shown by the solid lines in fig .",

    ", the parameter @xmath46 tends to 1 , i.e.  0 db , as in that case , no gain due to precoding is possible and the symbol with smallest magnitude is preferred .",
    "the minimum of the transmit power is shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ rect ] .",
    "note that precoding enables to achieved finite transmitted energy per symbol even if the channel matrix is singular .",
    "this effect has already been explained for marchenko - pastur distributed random matrices . unlike the curve without precoding , the curves for @xmath143 do not have poles at the threshold load .",
    "instead , a phase transition occurs and the energy per symbol jumps discontinuously from a finite value to infinity .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that the threshold load at which this happens is universal for a large class of random matrices in that it depends only on the specifics of the precoding lattice but not on the channel statistics .",
    "consider now the case shown in fig .",
    "[ figth4q ] .",
    "it has the following properties : @xmath144 this case extends the one - dimensional precoding of binary phase - shift keying ( bpsk ) on the real line to two - dimensional precoding of quaternary phase - shift keying ( qpsk ) in the complex plane such that gray mapping is applied and we can consider the pre - coding for qpsk as independent pre - coding of bpsk in both quadrature components .",
    "the symmetry in both quadrature components implies that @xmath145 compared to the one - dimensional case , the only difference is that the right hand sides of the two fixed point equations are multiplied by a factor of 2 which stems from adding the contributions of both quadrature components . in order to allow for a fair comparison with 1-dimensional modulation",
    ", we shall consider the energy per bit @xmath146 to be the performance measure of choice .",
    "due to de - coupling between quadrature components , we find that ( [ es1diminv ] ) remains valid and @xmath147 and @xmath46 are given by @xmath148 the solutions to these fixed point equations are shown in fig .  [ grayinv ] .",
    "remarkably , the energy per bit remains as small as @xmath149 for any load if @xmath124 grows large .",

    "the boarderlines of the voronoi regions are not parallel to the real and imaginary axes but intersect these by an angle of @xmath153 .",
    "considering an unconstrained lattice , i.e.  infinitly many lattice points , we can rotate the lattice by @xmath153 degrees without loss of generality due to the rotational invariance of the complex gaussian integral kernel in the fixed - point equations for @xmath47 and @xmath46 .",
    "after rotation we find the same lattice as in the two - dimensional quadrature precoding except for a lattice scaling by a factor of @xmath154 .",
    "thus , the energy per symbol will be half the energy per symbol of quadrature precoding and the energy per bit will be identical .",

    "we have found that vector pre - coding can significantly reduce the required transmitted power . in fact , with appropriate pre - coding , the transmitted power stays always finite .",
