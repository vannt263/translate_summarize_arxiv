    "in fact , the contributions of the sls interaction and those of the als one are separated to each other by considering the linear combinations of the vector analyzing powers , the spin correlation coefficients , the polarization transfer coefficients , etc . , each of which is proportional to the strength of the sls or als interactions .",
    "similar linear combinations have been found to be sensitive to the tensor interactions and the spin - independent and spin - spin central ones .    a part of the theoretical predictions is numerically examined for the @xmath155 scattering as an example .",
    "the observables have been calculated by the use of the series of the nsc97 interactions and it has been found that some linear combinations of the observables are useful to discriminate the different versions of the interaction even when their cross sections are similar to be indistinguishable .",
    "the total cross section has been investigated for the unpolarized beam and target as well as for the longitudinal - polarized ones and for the transverse - polarized ones .",
    "these provide the imaginary parts of the amplitude of the forward scattering by the spin - independent central interactions , the spin - spin central ones , and the tensor ones .",
    "measurements of these cross sections in scattering of neutral hyperons by the proton therefore will provide important information of the interactions , particularly of the nature of the coupling with the related reaction channels .",
    "due to the significance of information on the @xmath1 interaction , we hope more experiments to be performed for polarization phenomena in the @xmath1 scattering so that the details of the interactions , which include the spin dependence , will be determined .",
