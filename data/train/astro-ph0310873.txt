    "observations of high redshift type ia supernovae ( snia ) have recently generated much excitement and interest in @xmath0cdm cosmological models , deriving strong constraints on the cosmological constant , @xmath0 ( e.g. perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ; riess et al .",
    "there are still uncertainties regarding the standard candle assumption that underlies this approach , however , and we do nt yet have a good understanding of snia physical processes .",
    "it is therefore important to develop independent ways to constrain @xmath0 in order to confirm this tantalizing result , as different methods suffer from different systematic uncertainties .",
    "different astronomical datasets are sensitive to different combinations of the cosmological parameters . for example , the recent wmap cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations provide a strong constraint on @xmath11 ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , whereas the shape of the matter power spectrum , probed by either galaxies ( percival et al . 2001 ) or qsos ( outram et al . 2003 ) , is sensitive to @xmath12 . by combining several approaches we can break these degeneracies and hence derive much stronger constraints on the model that best describes our universe ( e.g. efstathiou et al .",
    "neither the cmb nor the large - scale structure observations , however , are directly sensitive to @xmath13 , and can only indirectly infer its value when the two datasets are combined .",
    "alcock & paczynski ( 1979 ) suggested that @xmath0 might be measured directly from redshift - space distortions in the shape of large - scale structure , by making the simple assumption that clustering in real - space is on average spherically symmetric .",
    "geometric distortions occur if the wrong cosmology is assumed , due to the different dependence on cosmology of the redshift - distance relation along and across the line of sight , and from the size of these geometric distortions , the true cosmology can be determined .",
    "one approach to implementing this test is to use the distribution of qsos to probe large - scale structure . by comparing the clustering of qsos along and across the line of sight and modelling the effects of peculiar velocities and bulk motions in redshift space ( ballinger et al .",
    "1996 , matsubara & suto 1996 ) , geometric distortions can be detected .",
    "the ideal sample for this is the recently completed 2df qso redshift survey ( 2qz ) .",
    "data for 2qz were obtained using the aat 2df facility .",
    "the completed survey comprises some 23000 @xmath14 qsos in two @xmath15 declination strips , one at the south galactic pole and one in an equatorial region in the north galactic cap spanning the redshift range @xmath16 .",
    "the 2qz catalogue and spectra were released in july 2003 ( croom et al . 2003 ) and can be obtained at http://www.2dfquasar.org .",
    "outram et al .",
    "( 2001 ) produced a preliminary analysis of redshift - space distortions in the power spectrum , @xmath2 , of the incomplete 10k 2qz survey ( croom et al .",
    "2001 ) . to help develop the method , and to test estimators designed to discriminate the effects of infall ( measured via the parameter @xmath17 ) , small - scale velocity dispersion , and geometric distortions ,",
    "a simulation of the 2qz was used .",
    "three light cone strips of the redshift survey were simulated , using the virgo consortium s huge hubble volume n - body @xmath0cdm simulation ( frenk et al .",
    "2000 , evrard et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the effects of infall and geometry on the clustering distribution are very similar , and this approach alone could therefore only provide a degenerate constraint on @xmath0 and @xmath18 .",
    "outram et al",
    ". found , however , that this degeneracy could be broken by jointly considering a second constraint based on mass clustering evolution . using the hubble volume simulation , outram et al .",
    "predicted that this method should constrain @xmath18 to approximately @xmath19 , and @xmath13 to @xmath20 using the final 2qz catalogue . a complementary approach , using the two - point correlation function , @xmath21 , to investigate redshift - space distortions in qso clustering",
    "can also be considered ( hoyle et al . 2002 ) . here",
    "we shall apply the analysis developed in outram et al . to the final 2qz sample , and hence derive this significant new constraint on @xmath0 .",
    "we reapply the analysis described in outram et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to the final 2qz catalogue , containing 22652 qsos ( only those qsos with quality 1 are used in this analysis ; see croom et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for further details ) .",
    "for convenience we review the main details below .",
    "we account for the various selection effects introduced into the 2qz catalogue by generating a catalogue of random points that mimics the angular and radial selection functions of the qsos but otherwise is unclustered .",
    "details of the qso selection function used can be found in section 2.1 of outram et al .",
    "we are measuring qso clustering as a function of comoving distance , and so need to assume a cosmology in order to convert from redshift into comoving distance .",
    "geometric distortions in the shape of large - scale structure occur if this cosmology is wrong , due to the different dependence on cosmology of the redshift - distance relation along and across the line of sight . from the size of these geometric distortions , measured in the qso power spectrum , @xmath2",
    ", the true cosmology can be determined .",
    "the choice of adopted cosmology should nt matter in this analysis ; adopting an incorrect cosmology does not affect the validity of this result . to check for consistency ,",
    "however , we consider two possibilities ; an einstein - de sitter ( @xmath22=1.0 , @xmath13=0.0 ) cosmology @xmath5 ( eds hereafter ) and an @xmath23=0.3 , @xmath13=0.7 cosmology @xmath5 ( @xmath0 hereafter ) . to limit incompleteness , we restrict our analysis to @xmath24 .",
    "this restricts our sample to 19549 qsos with a mean redshift of @xmath25 .",
    "the power spectrum estimation is carried out as described in outram , hoyle & shanks ( 2001 ) . when calculating @xmath2 , information about the line of sight",
    "must be retained . to achieve this",
    "the data are divided into subsamples that subtend a small solid angle on the sky , and the distant - observer approximation is then applied .",
    "the data from each declination strip are split into 8 regions each approximately @xmath26 during this analysis .",
    "each region is embedded into a larger cubical volume , which is rotated such that the central line of sight lies along the same axis of the cube in each case .",
    "the density field is binned onto a 256@xmath27 mesh , using nearest grid - point assignment .",
    "the power spectrum of each region is estimated using a fast fourier transform ( fft ) , and the average of the resulting power spectra is taken .",
    "the results , binned logarithmically into @xmath28 and @xmath29 , are plotted in figure  [ figdataom ] ( assuming an eds @xmath5 ) and figure  [ figdatalam ] ( assuming a @xmath0 @xmath5 ) .",
    "the measured power spectrum is convolved with the power spectrum of the window function .",
    "the power spectrum of the window function is shown in figure  [ figwin1d ] .",
    "we compare the 2qz window function to that of the 10k catalogue and the 25k mock catalogue determined in outram et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . due to the varying observational and spectroscopic incompleteness imprinted on the angular distribution of the 2qz qsos ,",
    "the points lie slightly above those of the mock catalogue ( where it was assumed that the angular distribution of the final catalogue would be uniform ) , but significantly lower than those of the 10k catalogue , due to the increased coverage .",
    "outram et al .",
    "( 2001 ; section  2.3 ) adopted limits of @xmath28 & @xmath30 @xmath31mpc@xmath32 for the analysis of @xmath2 to avoid any problems due to the effect of the window function on large scales .",
    "whilst slightly higher than that of the mock catalogue , the window function is still sharply peaked in @xmath33-space , and so we adopt the same limits in the case of the @xmath0 @xmath5 analysis .",
    "any window function effects should still be negligible .",
    "assuming an eds @xmath5 , however , the comoving distances probed are smaller , and hence the window function affects smaller scales . the appropriate limits to adopt in this case are @xmath28 & @xmath30 @xmath34mpc@xmath32 .",
    "a different error estimate is adopted in this paper from that of outram et al .",
    "they adopted two methods to estimate the error in the power spectrum measurements ; either via the dispersion between the power spectrum measurements from three declination strips of the hubble volume simulation , or the error estimate obtained using the method of feldman , kaiser & peacock ( fkp ; 1994 ) .",
    "the two estimates agree fairly well , but with large scatter .",
    "the fkp error is , on average , slightly lower than the error estimated from the dispersion betwen the three mock strips .",
    "neither approach is ideal ; the error estimated from the dispersion has a high uncertainty due to the small number of mock catalogues , and relies on the power of the mock catalogues being similar to that of the 2qz catalogue , whereas the fkp error estimate assumes a thin shell geometry , and can under - estimate the error on some scales , due , for example , to the onset of non - linearity .    in order to apply the distant - observer approximation ( see section  [ pse ] ) the qso power spectrum was estimated separately in sixteen individual @xmath35 regions . for this paper we have chosen to estimate the errors self - consistently from the data by considering the dispersion in these sixteen power spectrum measurements .",
    "as these regions are taken from just two contiguous strips , they lie next to each other , and are not entirely independent .",
    "it is therefore possible that they slightly underestimate the error in the power estimate , especially on large scales .",
    "whilst we believe this effect would be small on the scales of interest , and hence do not consider it further in this paper , to test this fully would require several independent simulations of the survey , which are not currently available due to the large volume probed .",
    "this error estimate agrees well , on average , with estimates obtained from the hubble volume simulation ( see section  2.4 of outram et al .",
    "2001 ) , but is slightly larger than the fkp error estimate .",
    "the power spectrum model incorporating redshift distortions that we fit to the data is presented in ballinger , peacock and heavens ( 1996 ) , and briefly summarized below .",
    "the power spectrum analysis was carried out assuming either an @xmath22=1.0 , @xmath13=0.0 cosmology or an @xmath23=0.3 , @xmath13=0.7 cosmology .",
    "if the true cosmology differs from this then geometric distortions will be introduced into the clustering pattern , due to the different dependence on cosmology of the redshift - distance relation along and across the line of sight .",
    "our distance calculations will be wrong by a factor @xmath36 perpendicular to the line of sight , and @xmath37 along the line of sight ( as defined in ballinger et al .",
    "thus we can define a geometric flattening factor :    @xmath38    ( ballinger et al .",
    "the effect this has on the power spectrum is given by @xmath39^{\\frac{n}{2}}\\ ] ] ( ballinger et al .",
    "1996 ) where @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the spectral index of the power spectrum . by measuring the size of this geometric flattening , @xmath42 , seen in the power spectrum @xmath43 , we can therefore calculate the true value of @xmath13 .",
    "unfortunately the problem is complicated by the fact that redshift - space distortions are also caused by peculiar velocities .",
    "the main cause of redshift - space distortions on the large linear scales probed by the qso power spectrum are coherent peculiar velocities due to the infall of galaxies into overdense regions .",
    "this anisotropy takes a very simple form in redshift - space , depending only on the density and bias parameters via the combination @xmath44 : @xmath45 ^ 2\\ ] ] ( kaiser 1987 ) where @xmath46 , and @xmath47 refer to the redshift - space and real - space power spectra respectively .",
    "whilst we expect the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath23 , and hence @xmath18 to vary as a function of redshift , we determine an average @xmath49 over the redshift range @xmath24 from the 2qz data , and hence only fit a single value of @xmath50 to the observed distortion .",
    "we consider the effect of allowing @xmath51 to vary on the model , to test whether such variations could introduce systematic uncertainties , and whether the value of @xmath18 obtained represents a true average value for @xmath52 over the range @xmath24 .",
    "combining the redshift - space distortion power spectrum models generated using a varying @xmath51 , weighted using the qso @xmath53 , we can determine an average model @xmath49 .",
    "we assume a simple bias model , designed to match the observations of outram et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , where the qso clustering amplitude increases linearly with redshift by 30 per cent from @xmath54 to @xmath55 ( assuming @xmath0 ) . in this evolving bias model , the best - fitting value of @xmath51 increases with redshift from @xmath56 , reaching a maximum of @xmath57 , before decreasing to @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the value averaged over the qso @xmath53 is @xmath60 , in almost perfect agreement with the simple model with a single value of @xmath61 , and the value of @xmath13 obtained was unchanged , indicating that any systematics introduced by variations in @xmath18 with redshift are much smaller than the errors .    to truly constrain @xmath18 as a function of redshift , using redshift - space distortions",
    ", we would have to measure the qso power spectrum in redshift bins .",
    "unfortunately , due to the smaller sample sizes and volume probed for each bin , the errors in such an analysis would be considerably larger than any expected change in @xmath18 with the size of the current dataset , and so no useful constraint would be obtained .",
    "therefore we have not included such an analysis in this paper .",
    "anisotropy in the power - spectrum on small scales is dominated by the galaxy velocity dispersions in virialized clusters .",
    "this is modelled by introducing a damping term .",
    "the line of sight pairwise velocity ( @xmath62 ) is implicitly divided by @xmath63 and quoted in units @xmath64mpc .",

    "1996 ) where @xmath70 .",
    "following outram et al . ( 2001 ) , we also consider a second constraint on @xmath0 and @xmath18 , based on the evolution of mass clustering from the average redshift of the 2qz to the present day .",
    "first we need an estimate of the @xmath71 mass clustering amplitude . for this",
    "we could adopt local measurements of @xmath72 ( e.g. eke et al 1996 ; hoekstra et al 2002 ) , however , to limit systematics , we choose to determine the local mass clustering amplitude using the reverse of the method applied at @xmath73 using 2qz .",
    "therefore we will use the recent observations of the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) .",
    "hawkins et al . ( 2003 ) used the 2dfgrs catalogue to determine the real - space galaxy correlation function at an effective redshift of @xmath74 , finding it to be well - described by a power - law @xmath75 out to scales of @xmath76mpc , where @xmath77mpc and @xmath78 . using the same sample of galaxies , hawkins et al . produced a measurment of @xmath79 , using redshift - space distortions in the two - point galaxy correlation function",
    "the value of @xmath80 was measured on scales @xmath81mpc .    for each cosmology ( again we only consider flat cosmologies ) the value of the galaxy - mass bias can be found from @xmath82 , which in turn gives the amplitude of the mass correlation function from the measured galaxy correlation function .",
    "the evolution in the mass correlation function from @xmath74 to @xmath83 can then be calculated for this cosmology using linear theory , and hence by comparing the @xmath83 mass correlation function to the 2qz correlation function , an estimate of the qso bias factor , and therefore @xmath50 can be obtained , as a function of cosmology . as in the previous section",
    ", this method assumes that a single value of @xmath52 applies at the average redshift of the qso survey , which , at least in the case of the evolving bias model discussed in section  3 , is a good approximation ( we obtain a best fit of @xmath84 in the evolving bias model , assuming @xmath0 , almost identical to the average value of @xmath60 ) .",
    "here we fit the redshift - space distortions model discussed in section  [ secmod ] to the qso power spectrum , @xmath2 , described in section  [ secpk ] .",
    "there are several free parameters in the model ( equation  [ model ] ) ; @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , the underlying real - space power spectrum .",
    "to reduce the uncertainties on the parameters of interest , @xmath18 and @xmath42 , we make simple assumptions about the other parameters .",
    "there is an uncertainty in determining qso redshifts from low s / n spectra of @xmath87 ( croom et al .",
    "this introduces an apparent velocity dispersion of @xmath88km@xmath66s@xmath32 . by adding this in quadrature to the intrinsic small - scale velocity dispersion in the qso population",
    ", we therefore expect an observed velocity dispersion of @xmath89km@xmath66s@xmath32 ( assuming an intrinsic velocity dispersion of @xmath90km@xmath66s@xmath32 ) .",
    "@xmath62 is not well constrained in this analysis , due to the large scales probed and so we have allowed @xmath62 to vary , within the range @xmath91km@xmath66s@xmath32 , choosing the value that maximised the likelihood of the fit . whilst @xmath62 has relatively little effect on the power spectrum at large scales ,",
    "any difference in the true value from our assumed range would lead to a small systematic shift in the resulting best fit values of @xmath13 and @xmath18 .",
    "this could be due , for example , to an underestimate of the qso redshift determination error caused by the intrinsic variation in line centroids between qsos .",
    "we reconstruct a real - space power spectrum self - consistently from the measured qso redshift - space power spectrum ( outram et al . 2003 ) . to remove noise",
    "we adopt the best - fitting model redshift - space power spectra given in table 4 of outram et al .. the real - space power spectrum is then obtained by inverting the above redshift distortion equations in each cosmology for an average value of @xmath92 .",
    "finally , we assume a flat cosmology , consistent with the recent wmap cmb results ( spergel et al .",
    "we choose to fit the variable @xmath13 , and fix @xmath93 .",
    "we fit the model to the 2qz data by performing a maximum likelihood analysis , allowing the parameters @xmath18 , and @xmath13 to vary freely and determining the likelihood of each model by calculating the @xmath94 value of each fit . only those wavenumbers with @xmath95 , and @xmath96 ( assuming @xmath0 ) , or @xmath97 , and @xmath98 ( assuming eds ) are used in the fit .",
    "the former constraints are applied to remove the effects of the window function , and the latter because the fft is unreliable at smaller scales .",
    "this constraint also prevents excessive non - linearity , where the model breaks down .",

    "@xmath18 plane , assuming an eds and @xmath0 cosmology @xmath5 respectively .",

    "the absolute @xmath94 values indicate that the best - fitting models provide an adequate fit to the power spectrum .",

    "[ figfitom ] and  [ figfitlam ] show , there is a large degeneracy between the fitted values of the two parameters , due to the similarity in the shape of the redshift - space and geometric distortions ( ballinger et al .",

    ", monte carlo simulations were performed .",
    "1000 realizations of the @xmath0 @xmath5 2qz power spectrum were drawn from the best fitting model ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) , assuming a fractional uncertainty on each data point equal to that estimated from the true power spectum ( see section  [ errsec ] ) .",
    "the redshift - space distortions model was fitted to each realization of the qso power spectrum , as discussed above .",

    "this was derived using significantly smaller scales than the @xmath2 analysis , and so we can treat the results as independent and hence combine the likelihoods , yielding a much stronger fit .    assuming an eds @xmath5 , the joint best fit values obtained are @xmath8 and @xmath9 . the best fitting flat @xmath111 model with @xmath112 ( shown in figure  [ figdataom ] )",

    "hence we are implicitly assuming that bias is scale independent on these scales . whilst this is likely to be true ( e.g. verde et al .",
    "2002 ) , a non - linear bias on these scales would introduce a systematic error in our results . to reduce any possible systematic effects further the value of @xmath114",

    "although at a much lower redshift , there will also still be a small cosmological dependence in the determined value of @xmath114 which should be taken into account .    instead of using the correlation function amplitude to trace the evolution in clustering ,",
    "the amplitude of the spherically averaged qso power spectrum ( outram et al . 2003 ) could be compared to that of local galaxies ( percival et al .",
    "the different effects on the respective power spectra of small - scale velocity dispersions , redshift uncertainties and , most importantly , the two survey window functions have to be taken into account in the comparison .",

    "in this paper we have reported on measurements of the cosmological constant , @xmath0 , and the redshift space distortion parameter @xmath1 , based on an analysis of the qso power spectrum parallel and perpendicular to the observer s line of sight , @xmath2 , from the final catalogue of the 2df qso redshift survey .",
    "we have derived a joint @xmath3 constraint from the geometric and redshift - space distortions in the power spectrum . by combining this result with a second constraint based on mass clustering evolution , obtained by comparing the clustering amplitude of 2qz qsos at @xmath73 with that of 2dfgrs galaxies at @xmath71 ( hawkins et al . 2003 )",
    ", we have broken this degeneracy , obtaining strong constraints on both parameters .    assuming a flat ( @xmath131 ) cosmology and a @xmath0 cosmology @xmath5 we find best fit values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "assuming instead an eds cosmology @xmath5 we find that the best fit model obtained , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , is consistent with the @xmath0 @xmath5 results , and again strongly favours a @xmath0 dominated cosmology .",
    "indeed , the eds cosmology @xmath5 result is inconsistent with a flat @xmath10 cosmology at over 95 per cent confidence .",
    "we determine the 2qz power spectrum in a single adopted cosmology .",
    "following alcock & paczynski ( 1979 ) , ballinger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and outram et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we fit the size of the geometric distortions in the power spectrum that arise if this cosmology is incorrect , hence deriving a constraint on the true value of @xmath13 .",
    "an alternative approach would be to measure the 2qz power spectrum in each of the cosmologies considered in this paper ( with @xmath132 ) , rather than just an adopted cosmology , then measure the goodness - of - fit of the redshift - space distortions model ( without geometric distortions ) in that cosmology , determining which cosmology provides the best overall fit .",
    "obviously , this would be expected to occur when there were no geometric distortions in the power spectrum .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath94 values obtained for the best fits to the @xmath0 and eds cosmology 2qz power spectra suggests that this method might provide an even tighter constraint on @xmath13 . however , there is considerable ( @xmath105 per cent ) noise in the absolute @xmath94 value of the best fit to any power spectrum realisation ( which manifests itself even when only subtle changes to the fft parameters or binning are made , let alone changes in the adopted cosmology ) . whilst this has little effect on the best fitting @xmath18 and @xmath13 parameters in a given realisation ( much smaller than the quoted uncertainties ) ,",
    "it does inhibit the comparison of @xmath94 fits from different realisations .",
    "this approach would no doubt also confirm that @xmath0 dominated cosmologies are strongly favoured by the 2qz power spectrum , however , a much noisier picture would therefore emerge .",
    "outram et al .",
    "( 2003 ) presented an analysis of the spherically - averaged 2qz power spectrum .",
    "they found very good agreement between the qso power spectrum and the hubble volume @xmath0cdm simulation over the whole range of scales considered . from the shape of the qso power spectrum outram et al . derived a low value of @xmath133 ( where @xmath134 is the hubble parameter ) that is hard to reconcile with a standard ( @xmath135 ) cdm model .",
    "their results are entirely consistent with the analysis described in this paper , of redshift - space distortions in the same qso power spectrum , and taken together they provide strong evidence in favour of the @xmath0cdm scenario .",
