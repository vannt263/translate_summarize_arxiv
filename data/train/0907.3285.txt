    "symmetries have played an important role in particle physics . in quantum mechanics a symmetry is associated with a group of transformations under which a lagrangian remains invariant .",
    "symmetries limit the possible terms in a lagrangian and are associated with conservation laws . here",
    "we will be concerned with the role of discrete symmetries : space reflection ( parity ) @xmath5 : @xmath6 , time reversal @xmath7 : @xmath8 and charge conjugation @xmath9 : @xmath10 .",

    "also , all lorentz invariant local quantum field theories are @xmath11 invariant . however , in weak interactions @xmath9 and @xmath5 are maximally violated separately but as we will see below , @xmath0 is conserved",
    ".    first indication of parity violation was revealed in the decay of a particle with spin parity @xmath12 called @xmath13-meson into two modes @xmath14 ( parity violating ) , and @xmath15 @xmath16(parity conserving ) .",
    "lee and yang in 1956 , suggested that there is no experimental evidence for parity conservation in weak interaction .",
    "they suggested number of experiments to test the validity of space reflection invariance in weak decays .",
    "one way to test this is to measure the helicity of outgoing muon in the decay : @xmath17    the helicity of muon comes out to be negative , showing that parity conservation does not hold in this decay . in the rest frame of the pion ,",
    "since @xmath18 comes out with negative helicity , the neutrino must also come out with negative helicity because of the spin conservation . thus confirming the fact that neutrino is left handed .",
