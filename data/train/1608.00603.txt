    "pests are a major concern in agriculture .",
    "locally , outbreaks cause financial losses and regionally , outbreaks threaten the food security of entire populations .",
    "this is of particular concern in developing nations for which agriculture constitutes a larger share of the economy but agricultural practices have not yet reached the same technical and procedural standards as in developed nations . in india , for example , the `` army worm '' _ spodoptera litura _ ( fabr . ) has defoliated many economically important crops including cotton , sunflower , and soybean @xcite .",
    "farmers have traditionally resorted to pesticides to prevent and mitigate pest outbreaks , but their use may have unwanted consequences including insect resistance , resurgence , outbreak of secondary pests , and pesticide residues affecting human health and the environment .",
    "heavy usage of synthetic pesticides have been linke to pest resistance , pest resurgence , health risks from exposure , and food contamination @xcite    biological pest control is an alternative to chemical pest control in which naturally occurring pathogens rather than pesticides are used to control the pests .",
    "the use of pathogens to suppress insect pests has several advantages over chemical pest control , in particular safety for farmers , consumers , and non - targeted organisms such as other natural enemies of the pest .",
    "entomopathogens can potentially be efficacious at low cost and should not normally pose any danger for either farmers or consumers .",
    "they can be host - specific , they preserve natural enemies , and they may beneficially impact biodiversity @xcite . unlike the use of pesticides ,",
    "there is little consensus on how to apply entomopathogens for maximal efficiency .",
    "this is not only because biological control agents have been introduced relatively recently , but it is also a consequence of a complex interplay of non - linear interactions between the crop , the pest , and the entomopathogen .",
    "the potential benefits of improved biological pest - control strategies are particularly large for inundative and augmentative control , in which large numbers of entomopathogens are released , as the timing of the release may significantly affect the total cost and efficacy .    a handful of studies have explored design of biological pest - control strategies from the perspective of mathematical analysis and/or optimal control theory .",
    "these studies have considered problems of bioeconomic equilibrium , demographic stability , and optimal release strategies @xcite .",
    "while these studies have furthered our understanding of biological pest control , the proposed pest - control strategies can not easily be communicated to agriculture professionals as they typically lack a regular pattern and often require continuous release of entomopathogens . moreover , with cardoso et al .",
    "( 2009 ) as an important exception , only single - objective optimization is usually considered . finally , to the authors",
    "knowledge , the studies to date have not explicitly modeled the crop , which as a third dynamic state variable could potentially impact the results . developing simple but efficient rules for biological pest control in agricultural systems with crop - pest - pathogen interactions thus remains an important challenge from both a theoretical and applied perspective .    in this paper",
    ", we develop simple strategies for biological pest control that are easy to apply , efficacious , and simultaneously near optimal ( 85% of maximum ) in terms of profit .",
    "the strategies are pareto - efficient in that they offer an optimal trade off between profit and efficacy .",
    "we demonstrate how to use our methods on a dynamic model of the _ spodoptera litura _ worm defoliating soybean crops while being controlled by a natural enemy , the _ spodoptera polyhedrosis _ virus @xcite .",
    "specifically , we investigate one - off control strategies and periodic control strategies . using our measures of efficacy and profit",
    ", we find pareto - efficient one - off and periodic control strategies that are close to optimal in the sense of profit and simultaneously not sensitive to perturbations .",
    "we show that one - off control strategies are preferable when immigration of pest is relatively low and intermediate .",
    "we also show that , for high immigration rates , one - off control can be replaced by simple periodic controls to achieve even better results .",
    "we first model a pest - pathogen - crop system in which pest is controlled biologically through the release of individuals that are infected with a virus .",
    "the infection spread into the susceptible pest population and thus control the growth of pest biomass in the field .",
    "second , we give a precise definition of the control strategies that we consider for the release of infective individuals .",
    "this class of control strategies is chosen for conceptual simplicity , though as we will show these strategies are capable of achieving near - optimal profits .",
    "third , we define our measures of profit and efficacy , after which we describe the concept of pareto efficiency used for dual - objective optimization .",
    "finally , we list the software packages used for numerical analysis .",

    "an overview of model variables and parameters is given in table [ tab01 ] .",
    "to arrive at a tractable model that nonetheless incorporate the essential features of the crop - pest - pathogen system , we integrate two influentaional and established models in theoretical biology , the rosenzweig - macarthur predator - prey model @xcite and the classical si - compartment model in epidemiology @xcite . on this basis , we assume that the dynamics of the crop are given by the following ordinary differential equation :    @xmath4    where the terms on the right hand side represent logistic growth in the absence of consumption by the pest , and consumption of susceptible and infected pests respectively .",

    "we have considered biological control of agricultural pests . using a dual - objective approach and the economic concept of pareto - efficiency ,",

    "depending on the immigration rate of pests from nearby fields , we recommend either one - off control , with entomopathogens released only once in the beginning of the growing season , or periodic control , with entomopathogens released at periodic intervals .",
    "surprisingly , as we showed in sect .  [ sect_optimal ] , these two conceptually simple pest - control strategies come close to the best that can be achieved , even when allowing for complicated continuous - release strategies .    the exact threshold for the immigration rate at which one should switch from one - off control to periodic control as well as the other control parameters can be determined from our model after it has been parameterized for the system of interest .",
    "we also believe that it should be possible to determine reasonable values for the control parameters through controlled field experiments , or even individual experimentation .",
    "future work may aim to overcome the problem of parametrization by deriving even more general insights , such as adaptive rules which relate the timing of release or the released quantity to observed changes in the crop and pest population .    when defining the periodic control strategies in sect .",
    "[ sec : model_control ] , we assumed that the same amount of pest is released once a week .",
    "this assumption should be considered more as an example than a rule .",
    "in fact , the efficacy of the periodic control will only be marginally affected by smaller changes in the length of this time interval .",
    "the costs associated with the periodic control does , however , strongly depend on the price of placing the infected pests in the field ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "a lower price will make the controls that releases more often ( higher @xmath18 ) better .",
    "moreover , a natural extension of the periodic controls tested here would be to allow for the combination of one - off control and periodic control .",
    "we have seen that one - off control performs well in most tested cases , and therefore we believe in releasing larger amounts of pest at impulses in the beginning of the growth season , and smaller amounts later during the season .",
    "we will further discuss this below .",
    "we have considered dual - objective optimization which accounts for both efficacy and profit .",
    "the fundamental drawback with optimizing profit alone is that the resulting crop trajectory may behave similar to the trajectory for crop biomass given in fig .",
    "[ fig : one]b .",
    "even worse , the increase in crop abundance may come closer to the end of the season so that a small perturbation during the growth season may pass it beyond the end of the season , as the trajectories of crop in fig .",

    "hence implies a high risk for farmers , we introduced in sect .",
    "[ sec : method ] a measure of efficacy , the half - biomass time , and applied a dual - objective approach through pareto - efficiency .",
    "our measure of efficacy , half - biomass time , is related to resilience , which is nowadays frequently used in ecology @xcite . in essence , short half - biomass time corresponds to high resilience as it means that the crop is quickly able to approach an equilibrium state . in ecology",
    ", resilience is usually defined as the reciprocal of the return time to a stable equilibrium of a trajectory , perturbed from the same equilibrium .",
    "therefore , a high resilience relates to a short half - biomass time .",
    "we define half - biomass time based on typical growth patterns for crops in our model .",
    "however , a similar definition will apply to other models showing similar growth patterns , involving models where biomass is assumed to grow logistic .",
    "it is worth noting that the measure half - biomass time may be replaced by any other suitable measure which can be defined for the model in question .",

    "the two objectives are measures of the number of prey ( the pest ) and the number of predators ( the natural enemy of the pest ) which are released . like us , these authors aim to derive more practical pest - control strategies by moving away from continuous - release strategies towards release at specified time points , so - called impulsive release @xcite .",
    "apart from the different choice of study system , a few differences are worth noting : first , cardoso et al .",
    "( 2009 ) do not compare the impulsive - control strategies that they derive with simple one - off control and periodic - control strategies as considered here .",
    "second , whereas we develop and motivate a non - linear measure of pest - control efficacy , cardoso et al .",
    "( 2009 ) uses a measure of the number of released natural enemies as the second objective .",
    "third , we explicitly consider the dynamics of the crop and move beyond the traditional lotka - volterra framework by incorporating realistic functional responses .",
    "interestingly , the optimal strategies presented in figs .  3 - 5 of cardoso et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have a clear resemblance to a periodic control except at the beginning and the end of season .",
    "based on this observation and our own results , we conjecture that effective strategies of biological pest control can be obtained by combining one - off control and periodic control .",
    "figure 3d shows the pareto - front for profit and half - biomass time when allowing for such combinations in the setting of intermediate immigration @xmath43 . in particular , the combined control has four control variables ; the amount of released pest in the beginning of the season ( @xmath47 ) , the total amount of released pest during the following periodic control ( @xmath48 ) , the number of days between pest impulses ( @xmath49 ) and the total number of impulses ( @xmath50 ) . by comparing figure 2b with figure 3d",
    "we conclude that the pareto - front is slightly higher in figure 3d .",
    "thus , allowing for combinations of periodic controls and one - off controls opens for slightly more efficient control strategies .",
    "moreover , the dotted curves in figure 3d , which reaches near pareto optimality , consists of strategies with only two impulses ( @xmath32 ) , the first at the beginning of the season and the second near the end of the season .",
    "hence , simple strategis performs well also when allowing for combinations of one - off control and periodic control .",
    "as noted in this paper , several studies in applied mathematics have aimed to determine optimal strategies of biological pest control .",
    "these studies draw upon and synthesize a rich scientific heritage of mathematical modeling in ecology , dynamical systems theory , and optimal control theory .",
    "the crowning achievement is the ability to determine the optimal timing for releasing entomopathogens across a range of pest - pathogen systems .",
    "this accomplishment of modern science will , however , be almost for nothing if insights are not distilled and the results disseminated in a form that is useful for the agricultural community .",
    "our aim with this paper has been to demonstrate how practically useful pest - control strategies can be determined from mathematical models of crop - pest - pathogen interactions . while we have arguably not succeeded in bridging the full width of the gulf that currently exist between mathematical theory and practical applications , we expect the width of that gulf to shrink as future authors continue the effort to uncover practically useful strategies of biological pest control .",
