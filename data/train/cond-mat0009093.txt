    "polymer solutions have attracted the attention of theorists and experimentalists alike for many decades , and a theoretical understanding of their structure and phase behavior , based on mean - field and on scaling or renormalization group arguments , is by now well established  @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a growing interest in the structure , phase behavior and rheology of binary systems involving colloidal particles and non - adsorbing polymer  @xcite . in such mixtures the mean size of the polymer coils , i.e.  their radius of gyration @xmath0 , is comparable to , or smaller than the diameter @xmath1 of the colloidal particles . since the latter may , for most purposes , be modeled as `` hard '' convex bodies dominated by excluded volume effects on the mesoscopic scale @xmath1 , it is clear that a statistical description of the polymer coils requires a high degree of coarse - graining to provide a tractable theory of these mixtures .",
    "such coarse - graining is , more generally , desirable for theoretical investigations of large scale phenomena involving large numbers of interacting polymer chains in the dilute of semi - dilute regimes . in particular",
    ", simulations of solutions involving many interacting polymer chains become rapidly intractable if a detailed description at the level of monomers or even of kuhn segments is retained .",
    "it is therefore tempting to consider polymer coils as `` soft '' particles , and to replace the detailed interactions between segments by an effective interaction acting between the centers of mass ( cm ) of different polymer coils as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : effective ] .",
    "similarly , an effective interaction must be worked out between the `` soft '' polymer coils and the `` hard '' colloidal particles .",
    "such a drastic reduction in the number of degrees of freedom , achieved by formally averaging over the coordinates of individual polymer segments , leads to a considerable simplification of the initial problem involving @xmath2 colloidal particles and @xmath3 polymer segments , where @xmath4 is the number of polymer coils and @xmath5 the number of monomers or segments per polymer ( i.e.  the length of a polymer ) .",
    "the idea of representing a polymer coil by a single particle of radius of the order of @xmath0 goes back to the work of flory and krigbaum  @xcite , who considered the infinite dilution limit of two isolated interacting polymers .",
    "a brief outline of subsequent theoretical and numerical work on the two - coil problem is given in section  [ sec : twopol ] .",
    "in this paper we generalize the idea to finite concentrations , i.e.  to dilute and semi - dilute polymer solutions . the effective interaction between the cm of polymer coils",
    "is determined by a combination of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of a detailed segment model of interacting polymers , and of an inversion technique which allows the effective pair interaction to be extracted from the mc results for the center of mass pair distribution function .",
    "a similar inversion technique is applied to the density profiles of the cm of the polymers near a hard wall to determine the effective interaction between a wall , impenetrable to the polymer segments , and the cm of interacting polymers .",
    "the effective polymer - polymer and wall - polymer interactions provide a first step towards a complete description of colloid - polymer mixtures , with the hard wall considered in this paper representing a single colloidal particle of infinite radius .",
    "the ultimate goal is to go well beyond the familiar asakura - oosawa ( ao ) model which considers polymers to be non - interacting point particles , excluded from a sphere of radius @xmath6 around each colloidal particle  @xcite .",
    "this model leads to the well - known ao depletion interaction between hard sphere colloids  @xcite . as an application of the general method outlined in this paper",
    ", the limitations of the ao picture will be illustrated in a calculation of the depletion interaction between two parallel hard walls .",
    "the effective interaction between polymer coils will be shown to lead to considerable deviations from the ao results , even in the dilute regime .",
    "a preliminary account of parts of the present work has been published elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "a related soft particle picture has recently been applied to polymer melts and polymer blends  @xcite . however , the phenomenological coarse - graining procedure proposed by these authors , and its practical implementation , differ considerably from the present `` first principles '' approach , which is better adapted to dilute and semi - dilute polymer solutions .",
    "both methods are good examples of current efforts to bridge widely different length and time scales in complex fluids .",
    "many physical properties of polymers in solution already emerge from simple models which ignore chemical detail and describe the polymers as self avoiding walks ( saw ) with hard segments interacting through a simple potential .",
    "for example , solutions of linear polymers in a good solvent are well modeled by @xmath7 athermal saw s , each made up of @xmath5 non - intersecting segments , on a cubic lattice of @xmath8 sites , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this model captures the leading scaling behavior and has been used for many decades to describe polymer solutions@xcite .",
    "slightly more sophisticated models exist , such as the fluctuating bond model  @xcite or off - lattice hard sphere chains@xcite , but the saw lattice model is simple , efficient and allows for comparisons with previous studies .    within the lattice model , the monomer packing fraction is equal to the fraction of lattice sites occupied by polymer segments , @xmath9 , while the concentration of polymer chains is @xmath10 . for a single saw chain , the radius of gyration scales as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the flory exponent@xcite .",
    "the overlap concentration @xmath13 , signalling the onset of the semi - dilute regime , is such that @xmath14 , and hence @xmath15@xcite .    to sample the configuration space of the polymer system",
    "we employ the monte carlo pivot algorithm@xcite which attempts to rotate part of the polymer around a random segment ( the pivot ) .",
    "if the new trial configuration shows no overlap , the move is accepted , otherwise the old configuration is restored .",
    "this simple scheme turns out to be very effective for single polymers and dilute polymer solutions where we found that it efficiently samples configurational space up to densities @xmath16 for @xmath17 polymers .",
    "because the polymers are restricted to a cubic lattice , the pivot move can only take place in 5 possible directions .",
    "for efficiency we store the complete lattice in memory , so that overlap between different polymers can be easily checked for . in this way",
    "one has only to check of order @xmath5 sites per polymer move , which is much more efficient than the @xmath18 sites needed when each pair of segments has to be tested for overlap .",
    "in addition to the pivot moves , we also attempt to translate the polymer .",
    "this monte carlo move enhances the relaxation to equilibrium of the polymer solution , although the acceptance ratio for this move decreases rapidly if the density exceeds @xmath19 ( for @xmath17 polymers ) . for densities deep in the semi - dilute regime , @xmath20",
    ", we therefore also perform configurational bias monte carlo ( cbmc ) moves  @xcite , in which part of the interior polymer is regrown .",
    "in addition , we attempt reptation moves where a limited number of segments at one end of the polymer are removed and regrown at the other end . by regrowing the polymer a bias",
    "is introduced , which is then corrected for in the sampling  @xcite . in the simulations at high densities",
    ", we find that we can regrow groups of up to about 20 - 40 segments in a cbmc move with a reasonable acceptance ratio ( about 40 - 50  % ) .",
    "more sophisticated algorithms for very dense polymer systems are available  @xcite , but are not necessary in our relatively dilute systems .",
    "the theory of the effective interaction between two polymer coils in dilute solution has a long history .",
    "the first calculations were by flory and krigbaum in 1950@xcite , who showed that , within a mean - field picture , saw polymers in a good solvent have a strongly repulsive interaction of the form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the distance between the cm of the two polymer coils , @xmath23 is the usual flory parameter , and @xmath24 is the reciprocal temperature , with @xmath25 denoting boltzmann s constant . as long as the polymers are in a good solvent , the chains can be regarded as athermal , and for that reason we set @xmath26 in the rest of this paper .    the interaction strength at full overlap , @xmath27 , can be understood from the following argument : each polymer coil has a density of monomers @xmath28 , while the volume of a polymer scales as @xmath29 , so that @xmath30 ( here @xmath31 is the flory exponent ) . if two polymers overlap completely then the mean - field free - energy of interaction would be proportional to the number of monomers times the probability of contact of two monomers on different chains : @xmath32 which implies that the polymer repulsion increases with polymerization @xmath5 , and is typically much larger than @xmath33 .    in an elegant paper , grosberg , khalatur , and",
    "khokhlov@xcite showed that flory s argument was in fact incorrect . from scaling theory",
    "it follows that the probability of an interaction between two monomers on different chains scales as @xmath34@xcite instead of simply @xmath35 , so that the free energy of interaction scales as : @xmath36 in other words , the free energy of interaction at full overlap of two equal - length polymers is independent of the degree of polymerization ; polymer coils are not nearly as `` hard '' as one might naively expect .",
    "krger , schfer , and baumgrtner@xcite put these ideas on a firmer footing using elaborate renormalization group ( rg ) calculations .",
    "in particular they calculated the full free - energy of overlap of polymers as a function of the cm distance .",
    "they found @xmath37 from an r - space @xmath38 expansion and @xmath39 from a @xmath40-space @xmath38 expansion ( @xmath41 , so @xmath42 for 3 dimensions ) .",
    "although there are still significant quantitative differences between an @xmath43 and an @xmath44 calculation , implying that the @xmath38 expansion has not quite converged , the qualitative picture is clearly that of a repulsive gaussian type potential , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v0 ] .",
    "these calculations were confirmed by a number of computer simulation studies , notably those by olaj and collaborators@xcite , and by dauntenhahn and hall@xcite .",
    "we repeated the calculation of the effective interaction between two isolated saw polymer coils , to make sure that the simulations are carried out under conditions sufficiently close to the scaling limit . for two polymers at infinite dilution",
    ", the effective interaction can be determined by calculating the normalized probability @xmath45 of finding their respective cm s at a separation @xmath22 .",
    "the effective potential @xmath46 is then defined as @xmath47 in the course of the simulation we sample configurations of two polymers infinitely far apart using only the pivot algorithm .",
    "after every 1000 pivot moves , we calculate the overlap probability as a function of cm distance , by moving the polymers towards each other while checking for overlap .",
    "in addition , the radius of gyration is calculated for each length considered , from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "this reproduces the well known flory scaling law @xmath50 .",
    "the effective interactions between two polymers of various lengths are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : v0 ] ; the distance @xmath22 is scaled with the measured radius of gyration @xmath0 . as expected , @xmath51 has a gaussian shape centered on @xmath52 .",
    "the potentials are almost indistinguishable for @xmath53 , but for smaller @xmath22 the potentials differ slightly for different @xmath5 .",
    "this is most pronounced at full overlap of the polymers , where @xmath54 decreases with length @xmath5 . in the scaling limit @xmath55",
    ", @xmath54 is expected to reach a finite value while for finite @xmath5 , we expect @xmath56 to scale as : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a ( negative ) constant and the logarithmic term arises because @xmath45 scales linearly .",
    "this finite - size scaling behavior is confirmed in fig.[fig : v0fits2 ] and in the @xmath59 limit this equation goes over to eq .",
    "( [ eq1.2 ] ) . using a non - linear fit of the mc data to eq .",
    "( [ eq1.5 ] ) we estimate @xmath60 , a value slightly higher than the best @xmath61 rg calculations which give @xmath62 .",
    "the difference is most likely due to a lack of convergence of the @xmath38 expansion  @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath63 is actually more relevant for the thermodynamic properties of polymer solutions than @xmath56@xcite , and , as demonstrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : v0 ] , the former varies less with @xmath5 than the latter , such that for @xmath63 the scaling limit appears to be reached even for chains as short as @xmath17 .",
    "similarly , with the effective pair - potentials we can calculate the 2nd osmotic virial coefficient : @xmath64 since the potentials scale with @xmath65 , this means that @xmath66 should be independent of @xmath5 in the scaling limit . as demonstrated in fig.[fig : b2 ] , the scaling limit appears to be practically reached for @xmath17 .",
    "we estimate that for @xmath67 , @xmath68 , which is consistent with other results obtained from simulations ( @xmath69@xcite ) or rg calculations ( @xmath70@xcite ) .",
    "note that although @xmath71 scales as @xmath72 , as required by scaling theory@xcite , this does not imply that the polymer - polymer interaction is hard - sphere like , as is sometimes implied in the literature@xcite .",
    "having derived the effective potential between two isolated polymers , we now attempt the same for polymers in solution at finite concentration . whereas for simple fluids , the interaction potential is generally independent of the thermodynamic state , this is not true for effective potentials in complex fluids .",
    "the latter typically follow from a coarse - graining procedure , which amounts to averaging out certain degrees of freedom , the individual microscopic polymer segments in the present case .",
    "the effective total interaction potential energy @xmath74 is in fact a _ free _ energy which depends here on the polymer density @xmath75 and on the configuration @xmath76 of the polymer cm s .",
    "the bare pair - interaction term @xmath46 can be defined as the effective potential between two isolated polymers , the bare triplet interaction term @xmath77 can be defined for three isolated polymers and so forth .",
    "one could in principle calculate higher and higher order n - body terms , but this rapidly becomes intractable . even if explicit expressions for each of the terms were obtained , the total interaction energy would be very difficult to evaluate because the number of n - tuple coordinates increases exponentially .    instead , we follow a different route and approximate the pair and higher order terms by an effective , ( state dependent ) pair interaction @xmath78 which is constructed to exactly reproduce the two - body correlations of the full underlying many - body system .",
    "in fact , it can be proven that for any given pair distribution function @xmath73 and density @xmath79 , there exists a corresponding _ unique _ two - body pair potential @xmath78 which reproduces @xmath73 _ irrespective of the underlying many - body interactions _ in the system@xcite . of course",
    ", @xmath73 will contain contributions not only from the bare pair - potential @xmath46 , but also from the three and more body terms . as a consequence",
    ", the effective pair interaction @xmath80 will also be state dependent ( in the polymer case , density dependent ) and a new effective potential must be calculated for each density .",
    "nevertheless , the effective potential leads back to the true thermodynamics of the full many - body system through the compressibility relation : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the fourier transform ( ft ) of the pair correlation function @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is the ft of the direct correlation function . using a variational argument ,",
    "reatto@xcite has shown that @xmath78 may also be viewed as the `` best '' pair representation of the true interactions .",
    "however this inversion approach says nothing about a possible volume term @xmath85 , in the coarse - grained total potential energy , which contributes to the e.o.s .  , but not _ directly _ to the pair - correlations@xcite .",
    "of course the volume terms may still contribute _ indirectly _ , for example when they induce phase - transitions .",
    "the inversion of @xmath73 to extract @xmath78 is a well known procedure and has been studied extensively in the field of simple fluids@xcite .",
    "we invert @xmath73 using the hypernetted - chain ( hnc ) closure , @xmath86 of the ornstein - zernike equation@xcite . while the simple hnc inversion procedure would be inadequate for dense fluids of hard core particles , where more sophisticated closures or iterative procedures are required@xcite , we are able to demonstrate the consistency of the hnc inversion in the present case .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations of @xmath7 saw polymers of length @xmath17 on a cubic lattice of size @xmath87 .",
    "the number of polymers was varied from @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) to @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "note that at the highest density the monomer packing fraction is @xmath92 , meaning that the conditions for the semi - dilute regime , namely @xmath93 _ and _ @xmath94 begin to be violated . at even higher densities",
    "the system will approach the melt regime where monomer packing effects become important@xcite .",
    "more generally , for finite length saw polymers , there is a limited density regime for which both conditions for the semi - dilute regime can be simultaneously satisfied .",
    "we find empirically that @xmath95 for saw polymers on a simple cubic lattice , so that the monomer packing fraction at the overlap concentration is given by @xmath96 thus , for @xmath48 chains we find @xmath97 so that there is only a very small density range which might be called semi - dilute , while for @xmath17 chains @xmath98 and a meaningful semi - dilute regime exists .",
    "the literature contains several claims of semi - dilute scaling behavior for saw lattice polymers with @xmath99 , but , as the analysis above shows , these polymers do not have a semi - dilute regime large enough to derive scaling relations .",
    "an example of this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zbf ] .    in the course of the simulations the cm of each polymer was tracked in order to construct the cm radial pair distribution function @xmath73 .",
    "the latter is only known up to a cutoff radius @xmath100 , which corresponds to half the size of the simulation box ( lattice size ) . for the inversion , we need @xmath73 for all @xmath22 , so we employ the following iterative scheme to extend @xmath73",
    ". first we set @xmath101 for @xmath102 and calculate the corresponding @xmath78 by inversion .",
    "we then set @xmath103 for @xmath102 and determine the corresponding @xmath73 for @xmath104 by a regular hnc calculation , using a simple iterative procedure .",
    "the @xmath73 for @xmath105 is then replaced by the measured @xmath73 , and the process is repeated until convergence . for low density , @xmath73 and @xmath106 converge very quickly , but for higher densities , say @xmath20 , the convergence is slower , and the mixing factor of the old solution into the new one has to be increased to a value as large as 99% .",
    "in fact , because of the finite box - size , the inversion process is underdetermined , and our ansatz that @xmath103 for @xmath107 is needed to find a unique solution .",
    "this is not unreasonable since we do nt expect the interactions between the polymer coils to be significant beyond a distance a few times the radius of gyration .",
    "however , to make sure that this is actually the case , we found that relatively large simulation boxes were needed , with a lattice size of up to @xmath108 .",
    "this is especially important at high density , where the inverted potential becomes longer ranged and more sensitive to small changes in the radial distribution function @xmath73 . in all our inversions we checked explicitly",
    "that @xmath106 becomes effectively zero for an @xmath109 , confirming our initial ansatz .",
    "the resulting radial distribution functions @xmath73 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gl500 ] , and are similar in shape to those of the pure gaussian core model@xcite . as the density goes up the correlation hole at small @xmath22 decreases in range and height . except for a small maximum around @xmath110 ,",
    "the pair correlation functions do not show oscillations within the statistical noise of about @xmath111 , for any density considered here .",
    "the effective polymer - polymer potentials @xmath80 , obtained from the @xmath73 s , are shown in fig.[fig : veffl500 ] .",
    "careful inspection of the figure reveals that the effective pair potential is not very sensitive to the polymer concentration .",
    "the value at @xmath52 first increases slightly with @xmath79 , before decreasing again at the highest concentrations , as is depicted in the inset of fig  [ fig : veffl500 ] , while the range of @xmath78 increases with @xmath79 . a more subtle feature , highlighted in fig .  [ fig : veffneg ] ,",
    "is that the effective potential becomes slightly negative @xmath112 for @xmath113 at the higher concentrations .",
    "these effects become apparent only when large enough box - sizes are used .",
    "although the negative tails seem very small , they are nevertheless significant since the thermodynamics depend on the integral of @xmath114 . for example , leaving them out can easily induce a @xmath115 change in the pressure .",
    "it is , therefore , paramount to include these effects in ( quasi)-analytical representations of the effective potentials .",
    "for that reason , a simple fit to a gaussian or a sum of gaussians is not accurate enough to reproduce the structure and the thermodynamics of the saw polymer systems and consequently , we chose to use an interpolation spline fit to describe the potentials .",
    "first , the raw effective potential data were fitted to a gaussian : @xmath116 subsequently , the difference @xmath117 was fitted by employing a least squares spline procedure with 8 nodes ( the `` dfc '' routine of the slatec library @xcite ) .",
    "the values of the nodes are not known in advance , except for the boundaries @xmath52 and @xmath118 .",
    "additional constraints on the spline fit were : @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "we optimized the spline fit by moving the nodes on the x - axis using a monte carlo procedure .",

    "[ fig : checkvpol ] the pair distribution function @xmath123 from md simulations is compared with the original saw @xmath73 for two densities in the semi - dilute regime .",

    "even so , the difference between the two distribution functions is still typically less then @xmath124 .",
    "we conclude that the hnc inversion procedure yields very accurate effective potentials for soft particles , capable of describing the structure of the fluid with an absolute error of less than @xmath124 .    in a previous paper",

    "<S> dilute or semi - dilute solutions of non - intersecting self - avoiding walk ( saw ) polymer chains are mapped onto a fluid of `` soft '' particles interacting via an effective pair potential between their centers of mass . </S>",
    "<S> this mapping is achieved by inverting the pair distribution function of the centers of mass of the original polymer chains , using integral equation techniques from the theory of simple fluids . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting effective pair potential is finite at all distances , has a range of the order of the radius of gyration , and turns out to be only moderately concentration - dependent . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the effective potential on polymer length is analyzed in an effort to extract the scaling limit . </S>",
    "<S> the effective potential is used to derive the osmotic equation of state , which is compared to simulation data for the full saw segment model , and to the predictions of renormalization group calculations . </S>",
    "<S> a similar inversion procedure is used to derive an effective wall - polymer potential from the center of mass density profiles near the wall , obtained from simulations of the full polymer segment model . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting wall - polymer potential turns out to depend strongly on bulk polymer concentration when polymer - polymer correlations are taken into account , leading to a considerable enhancement of the effective repulsion with increasing concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the effective polymer - polymer and wall - polymer potentials are combined to calculate the depletion interaction induced by saw polymers between two walls . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated depletion interaction agrees well with the `` exact '' results from much more computer - intensive direct simulation of the full polymer - segment model , and clearly illustrates the inadequacy  in the semi - dilute regime  of the standard asakura - oosawa approximation based on the assumption of non - interacting polymer coils .    2 </S>"
