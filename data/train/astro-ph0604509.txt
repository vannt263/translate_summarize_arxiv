    "over the past decade , x - ray observations have made it increasingly clear that black holes are capable of accreting gas under a variety of flow configurations . in particular ,",
    "there is convincing evidence that a distinct form of hot accretion exists at sub - eddington rates , which contrasts with the classical `` cold and thin '' accretion disk scenario ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . hot accretion appears to be common in the population of supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei and during the quiescent phases of accretion onto stellar - mass black holes in x - ray transients ( e.g. narayan et al .",

    "theories for the structure and properties of hot accretion flows remain controversial , however . inspired by the work of shapiro , lightman & eardley ( 1976 ) , narayan & yi ( 1994 ; 1995a , b ) derived self - similar adaf solutions which emphasized the important stabilizing role of radial heat advection ( see also ichimaru 1977 ; rees et al .",
    "1982 ; abramowicz et al . 1988 ) .",
    "subsequent analytical work on hot accretion flows has emphasized the possibility of outflows , motivated by a positive bernoulli constant ( narayan & yi 1994 ; adios : blandford & begelman 1999 ) , and the potential role of convection ( cdafs ; narayan et al .",

    "the purpose of this work is to consider the possibility that thermal conduction , which has been a largely neglected ingredient , could affect the global properties of hot accretion flows substantially . in  2 , we use existing observational constraints on a few nearby galactic nuclei to argue that hot accretion is likely to proceed under weakly - collisional conditions in these systems , thus implying that thermal conduction could be important . in  3 , we extend the original 1d self - similar solutions of narayan & yi ( 1994 ) to include a saturated form of thermal conduction and we study the effects of conduction on the flow structure and properties . in  4 , we generalize the 2d solutions of narayan & yi ( 1995a ) in the presence of thermal conduction and find that this extra degree of freedom allows the emergence of rotating thermal outflows . in  5 , we discuss our results in the context of recently established observational trends for hot accretion flows and related outflows . in  6",

    "_ chandra _ observations provide tight constraints on the density and temperature of gas at or near the bondi capture radius in sgr a * and several other nearby galactic nuclei .",
    "these observational constraints have been used before to estimate the rate at which the gas is captured by the black hole in these systems , following bondi theory ( e.g. loewenstein et al . 2001 ; di matteo et al .",
    "2003 ; narayan 2003 ) .",
    "here , we use these same constraints ( taken from loewenstein et al . 2001 ; baganoff et al . 2003 ; di matteo et al . 2003 ; ho , terashima & ulvestad 2003 ) to calculate mean free paths for the observed gas .",
    "it should be noted that these constraints are not all equally good , in the sense that _ chandra _ has probably resolved the gas capture radius in sgr a * and m87 but not in the other nuclei .",
    "galactic nuclei and their associated gas properties on @xmath4 scales are listed in table  [ tab : one ] : @xmath5 is the gas number density , @xmath6 is the temperature , @xmath7 is the @xmath4 size - equivalent at the nucleus distance , @xmath8 is the mean free path for the observed @xmath4 conditions and @xmath9 is the capture radius , inferred from the gas temperature and the black hole mass in each nucleus . from spitzer s ( 1962 )",
    "expressions for collision times , a standard expression for the thermal speed and a coulomb logarithm @xmath10 , one gets the simple mean free path scaling @xmath11  cm ( cowie & mckee 1997 ; valid for both electrons and protons in a 1-temperature gas ) .",
    "we have used this relation to calculate @xmath8 values in table  [ tab : one ] .",
    "the inferred mean free paths are in the few hundredths to few tenths of the observed @xmath4 scales ( @xmath12 values in table  [ tab : one ] ) . assuming no change in the gas properties down to the inferred capture radius , values of @xmath13",
    "are deduced in four of the six nuclei .",
    "one could also reformulate these scalings by stating that the @xmath4 mean free paths are systematically @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the schwarzschild radius ( the typical length - scale associated with the accreting black holes ) .",
    "these numbers suggest that accretion will proceed under weakly - collisional conditions in these systems .",
    "the weakly - collisional nature of adafs has been noted before ( e.g. mahadevan & quataert 1997 ) , in the sense of collision times longer than the gas inflow time , but these are model - dependent statements .",
    "direct observational constraints on the gas properties near the capture radius favor a weakly - collisional regime of hot accretion , more or less independently of the exact hot flow structure .",
    "whether the gas adopts an adaf , cdaf or adios type configuration once it crosses the capture radius , it is expected to become even more weakly - collisional as it approaches the black hole , since the relative mean free path scales as @xmath16 in these flow solutions with a virial temperature profile and a density profile @xmath17 .",
    "tangled magnetic fields in the turbulent accretion flow would likely reduce the effective mean free paths of particles .",
    "the magnitude of this reduction , which will depend on the field geometry , is currently unknown .",
    "we return to this important issue in our discussion section .",
    "even if the effective mean free paths of electrons are reduced to values @xmath18 , thermal conduction may be important .",
    "it is therefore of interest to investigate its effects on the structure and properties of hot accretion flows in general .",
    "we begin with a study of 1d adaf models with conduction in  3 and then move on to study a 2d version of these hot accretion flows in  4 .",
    "the standard spitzer formula for thermal conduction applies only to gas well into the collisional ( `` fluid '' ) regime , with a mean free path @xmath19 , for any relevant flow scale @xmath20 .",
    "we expect radial temperature variations on scales @xmath21 from self - similarity . in a weakly - collisional regime with @xmath22 or even @xmath23 , a saturated ( or equiv .",
    "`` flux - limited '' ) thermal conduction formalism should be adopted if one is to avoid unphysically large heat fluxes .",
    "we adopt the formulation of cowie and mckee ( 1977 ) and write the saturated conduction flux as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the saturation constant ( presumably @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 is the gas mass density and @xmath28 is its isothermal sound speed . with this prescription ,",
    "the largest achievable conduction flux is approximated as the product of the thermal energy density in electrons times their characteristic thermal velocity ( assuming a thermal distribution and equal electron and ion temperatures ; see cowie and mckee 1977 for details ) .",
    "because it is a saturated flux , it no longer explicitly depends on the magnitude of the temperature gradient but only on the direction of this gradient .",
    "heat will flow outward in a 1d hot accretion flow with a near - virial temperature profile , hence the positive sign adopted for @xmath29 .    with this formulation for conduction ,",
    "the steady - state 1-temperature self - similar adaf solution of narayan & yi ( 1994 ) can be generalized to include the divergence of the saturated conduction flux in the entropy - energy equation ( see also honma 1996 and manmoto et al .",
    "2000 for investigations of the role of `` turbulent '' heat transport in one - dimensional adaf - like flows ) . adopting the same cylindrical geometry and notation as narayan & yi ( 1994 )",
    ", we consider a `` visco - turbulent '' , differentially rotating hot flow which satisfies the following height - integrated equations for the conservation of momentum and energy @xmath30 supplemented by the continuity equation , which is rewritten as @xmath31 .",
    "the last term in equation  ( [ eq : ent ] ) is the additional divergence of the saturated conduction flux . in these equations",

    "a shakura - sunyaev prescription has been used to capture the `` visco - turbulent '' nature of the flow , with an equivalent kinematic viscosity coefficient @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the traditional viscosity parameter .",
    "we look for solutions to these equations of the form @xmath43 and use the notation @xmath44 .",
    "we find that the three unknowns @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 satisfy the relations @xmath48 while the density scale , @xmath49 , is fixed by the accretion rate , @xmath50 .",
    "contrary to the original adaf solution , the energy relation ( eq .  [ [ eq : enrel ] ] ) is not a quadratic in @xmath51 because of the extra saturated conduction term .",
    "we solve this fourth order polynomial with a standard numerical technique ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) and discard the two imaginary roots as well as the real root with negative @xmath47 , which is unphysical because of a conduction flux going up the temperature gradient .",
    "the main features of the new self - similar solutions with saturated conduction are illustrated in figure  [ fig : one ] , as a function of the value of the saturation constant , @xmath52 .",
    "we are showing results for two distinct solutions here , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 , while we have fixed @xmath40 and @xmath55 in both cases . even though a value of @xmath56 may not be physically meaningful , it is useful to illustrate more clearly how solutions depend on @xmath57 .",
    "original 1d adaf solutions are recovered at small @xmath25 values .",
    "as @xmath25 approaches unity , however , the solutions deviate substantially from the standard adaf . the sound speed , @xmath28 , and the radial inflow speed , @xmath58 , both increase with the magnitude of conduction , while the squared angular velocity , @xmath59 , decreases .",
    "formal solutions still exist when @xmath59 becomes negative but they are obviously physically unacceptable .",
    "the solution with @xmath53 reaches the non - rotating limit at @xmath60 , while the solution with @xmath61 reaches this limit for @xmath62 .",
    "both solutions have sub - virial temperatures ( @xmath63 ) and subsonic radial inflow speeds ( @xmath64 ) , which appear to be rather general properties .",
    "supersonic solutions may exist for large @xmath42 values when @xmath65 .",
    "as the level of saturated conduction is increased , more and more heat flows from the hotter , inner regions , resulting in a local increase of the gas temperature relative to the original adaf solution .",
    "simultaneously , the gas adjusts its angular velocity ( which reduces the level of viscous dissipation ) and increases its inflow speed to conserve its momentum balance ( increasing at the same time the level of advection ) .",
    "one can show from the energy equation that @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the magnitudes of the conduction and advection terms : solutions cease to exist once advection balances exactly the heating due to saturated conduction .",
    "we have found that variations in the advection parameter , @xmath69 , have relatively minor effects on the solutions , as long as @xmath69 is not @xmath70 .",
    "the breakdown of the solutions ( when @xmath71 ) occurs at lower values of the saturation constant @xmath25 for smaller @xmath42 and larger @xmath57 values .",
    "solutions with @xmath72 can be viewed as bondi - like solutions with saturated conduction .",
    "clearly , conduction can significantly affect the structure and properties of hot accretion flows , even at a level well below the saturated flux value ( i.e. for @xmath73 ) .",
    "by analogy with the reasoning of narayan & yi ( 1995a ) on convection in 2d self - similar adaf solutions , one might expect conduction to be more important in the polar regions of hot accretion flows than at their equator . to better understand the role of conduction , it is therefore important to study it in a more realistic two - dimensional setting , without height integration .",
    "we now extend the analysis of the previous section to two - dimensional hot accretion flows , following closely the methods of narayan & yi ( 1995a ) .",
    "we also discuss in appendix c the relation between our work and that of anderson ( 1987 ) . adopting spherical polar coordinates ( @xmath74 )",
    ", we consider axisymmetric , steady - state flows ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "we define keplerian angular and linear velocities as , respectively , @xmath76 and we use the same @xmath42-prescription as before to describe the visco - turbulent nature of the flow : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the isothermal sound speed ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the fluid equations obeyed by the visco - turbulent accretion flow are written as follows : @xmath80+\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla \\cdot ( \\lambda \\nabla t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the viscous stress tensor ( divided by the dynamic viscosity , @xmath82 ) .",
    "the notation for the other flow variables is the same as in  3 .",
    "it should become clear , later on , that our main results are not expected to depend critically on the exact form of the viscous stress tensor adopted . to allow a direct comparison with our results in  3 and for consistency with narayan & yi ( 1995a )",
    ", we use the same advection parameter @xmath69 to quantify the cooling efficiency of the flow .",
    "we will see , however , that this parameter is in fact ill - defined for solutions with conduction .",
    "fully developed forms of these equations ( with a few typos and no thermal conduction term ) can be found in narayan & yi ( 1995a ) .",
    "contrary to the formulation adopted in  3 , we do not write the conduction flux in a saturated form here , but return instead to a traditional form where the flux depends linearly on the local temperature gradient . justifications for this choice are provided in appendix  a. we adopt a form of the thermal conductivity coefficient which preserves the radial self - similarity of the solutions : @xmath83    following narayan & yi ( 1995a ) , we consider separable solutions satisfying @xmath84 in narayan & yi ( 1995a ) , the @xmath85 in the equivalent of eq .",

    "solutions automatically satisfy the continuity equation , eq .",
    "( [ cont ] ) .",
    "the problem is reduced to a one - dimensional differential system along the polar coordinate , @xmath87 .",
    "we are left to solve the following four coupled differential equations for the dimensionless variables @xmath88 and @xmath89 :    @xmath90 , \\label{momc}\\\\\\nonumber\\\\ -\\frac{3}{2}\\epsilon ^{\\prime } v_r & \\:=\\:&\\alpha\\left\\{3v_r^{2}+ \\left(\\frac{dv_r}{d\\theta}\\right)^{2 } + \\sin^{2}\\theta\\left[\\frac{9}{4}\\omega^{2 } + \\left(\\frac{d\\omega}{d\\theta}\\right)^{2}\\right ] \\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad+\\lambda_{0}^{\\prime}\\frac{1}{p } \\left[c_{s}^{2}+\\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta}\\frac{d}{d\\theta } \\left(\\sin\\theta \\frac{d c_{s}^{2}}{d\\theta}\\right)\\right ] . \\label{energy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for convenience , the parameters @xmath91 were introduced in the energy equation ( eq .  [ [ energy ] ] ) , where @xmath92 is the adiabatic index of the gas .",
    "this is a seventh - order differential system of four variables .",
    "the three momentum equations ( eqs  [ [ moma][momc ] ] ) are identical to those presented in narayan & yi ( 1995a ) .",
    "the energy equation ( eq .  [ [ energy ] ] ) differs in that extra terms corresponding to the radial and polar contributions to heat conduction are now present .",
    "this qualitative difference turns out to be crucial in providing the extra degree of energetic freedom necessary for inflow or outflow at the pole . while the original energy equation seemed to require that rotating solutions be static ( @xmath93 ) along the polar axis because of the positivity of all the viscous terms ( no rotating solutions with @xmath94 at @xmath95 were found by narayan & yi 1995a ) , the addition of thermal conduction terms allows for radial velocities at the pole which are generally non - zero .",
    "furthermore , for outflows to be energetically favored , the polar contribution to heat conduction ( second term in the last square bracket in eq .",
    "[ [ energy ] ] ) must be negative enough to overcome the positive sum of the radial conduction term and all the viscous terms on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) . when that happens , advection can act as an effective heat source , with a positive sign for the radial velocity , @xmath34 ( on the lhs of eq .",
    "[ [ energy ] ] ) .",
    "as we shall see below , this sign change for @xmath34 preferentially happens in polar regions of the flow and only for certain combinations of model parameters .",
    "boundary conditions for the system of differential equations are obtained by requiring that all flow variables be symmetric and continuously differentiable across the pole and the equator .",
    "this corresponds to the following conditions at @xmath96 and @xmath97 : @xmath98 as noticed by narayan & yi ( 1995a ) , these conditions are not all independent from each other , given eqs .",
    "( [ moma][energy ] ) , so that the system ends up not being over - constrained .    the net mass accretion rate , which one obtains from the volume integral of the continuity equation ( eq .  [ [ cont ] ] ) , is @xmath99 where the radial dependence has been omitted because of self - similarity .",
    "this integral supplies two additional boundary conditions to our system because we enforce it by solving the corresponding differential equation for @xmath100 and imposing the values of @xmath101 at @xmath95 and @xmath102 .",
    "the @xmath101 integral then uniquely determines the scaling of @xmath103 in our solutions . in what follows ,",
    "we have used @xmath104 ( from @xmath105 to @xmath106 ) consistently in all the solutions .",
    "we find numerical solutions with an implementation of the relaxation code described in hameury et al .",
    "we do not implement the adaptive mesh feature but simply solve the set of equations on a grid of @xmath107@xmath108 points equally spaced in @xmath87 .",
    "after recovering the original 2d adaf solutions of narayan & yi ( 1995a ) , we explored the parameter space of solutions with conduction in detail , in terms of the model parameters @xmath42 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows latitudinal profiles ( @xmath95 at the pole ) of the four dynamical variables in our model , for solutions with @xmath111 , @xmath112 and several values of @xmath110 . except for the density , @xmath27 ( which is normalized to @xmath113 ) , the radial velocity , @xmath34 , the angular velocity , @xmath35 , and the isothermal sound speed squared , @xmath114 , are all scaled to the local keplerian values . for small enough values of @xmath110 ( = @xmath115 ) ,",
    "solutions remain very close to the original 2d adaf solutions of narayan & yi ( 1995a ) , with @xmath34 ( nearly ) zero at the pole .",
    "note that this solution , with @xmath112 , is denser and cooler at the equator than at the pole and it corresponds to something like a `` thin disk '' surrounded by a hot coronal atmosphere .    as the value of @xmath110",
    "is increased , the solutions start deviating substantially from the original adaf , with faster radial inflow at the equator and significant radial outflow appearing in polar regions . the solution with @xmath116 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] illustrates this transition clearly .",
    "the flow also becomes hotter ( except around the poles ) , is rotating more slowly ( being more pressure supported ) and has a more uniform density profile , with a reduced density at the equator : it is gradually approaching spherical symmetry .",
    "as we shall see below , some of these variations in properties are shared by the original adaf solutions if the flow is forced to be more advective ( by reducing the value of @xmath109 ) .    as the value of @xmath110",
    "is increased further , another qualitative change in the solutions occurs , with inflow at the pole , outflowing regions away from the pole and still faster inflow at the equator . in other words , the outflow adopts a conical geometry .",
    "the solution with @xmath117 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] illustrates this regime . for even larger values of @xmath110 ,",
    "the solution switches to a global inflow pattern ( @xmath118 ) , with increasingly faster inflow in the polar regions , which ultimately overcomes the inflow speed at the equator ( @xmath119 ) . at the end of this sequence ( @xmath120 )",

    "we note that along this entire sequence of solutions , maximum inflow and outflow speed remained everywhere subsonic .",
    "as we shall see below in more detail , most of these solution properties can be understood in terms of the relative contributions of radial and polar conduction terms to the flow energetic balance .",

    "solutions with small @xmath109 values ( @xmath130 ) do not exhibit outflows , but only pure inflow regimes .",

    "the energy equation is then satisfied only if advection acts to cool the flow everywhere , which must then be globally inflowing . for the largest values of @xmath110 considered ,",
    "advection very nearly balances conduction as the viscous term drops precipitously and the non - rotating limit is reached . in good analogy with what we have seen for 1d solutions with conduction in  3 , the non - rotating bondi - like limit corresponds to strict equality between conduction and advection .    from this examination of energy balance in our radially self - similar solutions ,",
    "it is clear that the key to thermal outflows is the existence of strong enough cooling in the flow for advection to be allowed to act as a heat source .",

    "perhaps one of the most interesting property of the profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is that they show explicitly that there is no distinction , from the point of view of momentum balance , between inflowing and outflowing regions of the flow .",
    "this confirms that outflows , when they exist , are purely determined by energetic considerations .",

    "much of the discussion in the literature on the likelihood of outflows from hot accretion flows is articulated around the value of the bernoulli parameter , @xmath163 ( or , more generally , the bernoulli function ) .",
    "narayan & yi ( 1994 ; 1995a ) first emphasized the positivity of @xmath163 in their solutions and raised the possibility that this would lead to bipolar outflows .",
    "furthermore , blandford & begelman ( 1999 ) s motivation and method to develop adios is rooted in the notion that hot accretion flows with positive @xmath163 must have outflows and that their structure and properties should be accordingly modified , leading to a mass accretion rate varying with radius .",
    "the relevance of the value of @xmath163 for the generation of outflows has also been discussed in the context of numerical simulations ( e.g. stone et al .",

    "one concludes that the positivity of @xmath166 does not in general discriminate between inflowing and outflowing regions in our solutions .",

    "notice in particular in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] how solutions with @xmath166 changing from positive at the pole to negative at the equator can be alternatively ( nearly ) static , outflowing or inflowing at the pole .",
    "similarly , solutions with globally positive values of @xmath166 can be globally inflowing without any difficulty .",
    "the additional panels in figure  [ fig8 ] show two particularly striking examples of the loose relation between the sign of @xmath166 and the inflow / outflow properties of our solutions . in one solution , with @xmath172 ,",
    "the outflow has a conical geometry .",
    "while the value of @xmath166 decreases monotically with @xmath87 , the radial velocity is clearly not monotonic , with two sign changes . in the other solution , with @xmath173 ,",
    "the outflow is polar but there is a small regions at mid - latitudes where outflowing gas has negative @xmath166 value .",
    "although this type of `` violation '' is generally marginal , it clearly demonstrates that there is no strict relation between the sign of @xmath166 and the inflow / outflow properties of gas in our solutions .",
    "it should be noted that for large enough values of @xmath110 , one would expect the bernoulli parameter ( which is an adiabatic , inviscid quantity ) to lose its physical significance , since the flow must then become strongly diabatic .",
    "we suspect that the @xmath174 outflow region shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] and the globally inflowing solutions with globally positive @xmath166 values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] are all manifestations of this loss of significance of @xmath166 in flows with significant conduction .",
    "it is difficult to evaluate , from self - similar solutions alone , what the radiative efficiency of hot accretion flows with conduction may be . in our solutions ,",
    "the flow structure adjusts so that the divergence of the conduction flux generated in the innermost regions is balanced by an increased level of entropy advection .",
    "there will be no extra source of energy available in the presence of conduction ( in fact less is available in our solutions , since the viscous dissipation rate drops with @xmath35 ) , but the dissipated energy is redistributed differently in flows with conduction than in flows without .",
    "this redistribution affects the local flow properties ( density , temperature ) , which in turn affect its cooling properties .    using our 1d solution scalings (  3 ) for simplicity , it is possible to estimate crudely the modified level of emission expected relative to a standard adaf .",
    "free - free emission scales as @xmath175 for a given value of the accretion rate , @xmath176 .",
    "we find that this emission is effectively reduced , e.g. by as much as @xmath177 in the 1d solution of fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] with @xmath178 ( and much more in the @xmath61 solution ) .",
    "even though conduction heats up the gas locally , the reduced density resulting from the larger inflow speed dominates , leading to a net decrease in the expected level of free - free emission .",
    "on the other hand , the very steep dependence of synchrotron emission on the electron temperature ( e.g. mahadevan 1997 ) suggests that hotter solutions ( with conduction ) may be radiatively more efficient from the point of view of that process .",
    "these are only rough scalings , however . in light of several complications expected in global solutions with conduction ( see discussion in  6 ) , it is unlikely that we can determine , from self - similar solutions alone , how the global radiative efficiency of a hot accretion flow may be affected by conduction .",
    "we postpone a thorough discussion of this important issue to future work and focus here instead on the possible relevance of the outflows found in our solutions to a variety of observationally established trends for accreting black holes .    in recent years",
    ", much progress has been made in understanding the outflow / jet properties of accretion flows around black holes in x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei .",
    "various observational studies suggest that , in both classes of systems , there is a regime of steady outflow when black holes accrete well below the eddington rate ( for luminosities @xmath179 ) , while the outflow regime becomes flaring / unsteady at higher accretion rates ( e.g. ho 2002 ; gallo , fender , pooley 2003 ; merloni , heinz & di matteo 2003 ; fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ; nipoti , blundel & binney 2005 ; sikora , stawarz & lasota 2006 ) .",
    "some of the latest results support the notion that black holes accreting at sub - eddington rates do so through an advective form of accretion ( e.g. greene , ho & ulvestad 2005 ; koerding , fender & migliari 2006 ) , but there is some evidence in the `` low / hard '' state of at least two galactic black hole systems ( miller et al .",
    "2006 ) that a standard thin disk remains embedded in the hot flow ( a situation which may favor outflows according to our large @xmath109 solutions ) .",
    "it is tempting to relate these various observational trends with our results on thermal outflows from steady , hot accretion flows with conduction .",
    "the association would be strengthened if one could show that thermal conduction is expected to be equally important in hot accretion flows around stellar - mass and supermassive black holes .",
    "after all , we made the case for weakly - collisional accretion conditions only for systems harboring supermassive black holes in  2 .",
    "while the temperature profile does not depend on black hole mass in self - similar solutions scaled in units of the schwarzschild radius , density profiles do . to address this question , we compare the scalings for the coefficient of turbulent viscosity ( @xmath180 ) and the spitzer coefficient of thermal diffusivity ( @xmath181 ) , using for simplicity the adaf scalings in schwarzschild units of narayan et al .",
    "( 1998b ) .",
    "the comparison of these two diffusivity coefficients is the relevant one since it captures the relative magnitude of `` viscous '' and conduction effects on any scale of interest .",
    "we find that the two coefficients scale identically ( linearly ) with the mass of the central black hole , which suggests that conduction would indeed be equally important in hot accretion flows around stellar - mass and supermassive black holes .",
    "this conclusion is also consistent with the similar scalings with black hole mass of the accretion time and collision times discussed by mahadevan & quataert ( 1997 ) .",
    "it would be interesting to strengthen this comparison by using , as much as possible , observational constraints on hot accretion flows in x - ray binaries , as we have done for agn in  2 .    establishing on a firmer ground the relevance of the thermal outflows found in our solutions to observational trends for accreting black holes will clearly require additional work .",
    "in the meantime , we note that our solutions allow a direct scaling of the expected outflow power , per unit accreted mass , which is a quantity of obvious interest .",
    "recalling that the bernoulli constant , @xmath166 , represents the asymptotic value of the energy of gas escaping from the central mass gravity , we can use it as a measure of the outflowing energy rate and compare that to the rate of energy release due to accretion .",
    "the outflow power is simply @xmath182 .",
    "the accretion power is @xmath183 , if we pick a radius of maximum energy release of @xmath184 schwarzschild radii to fix the accretion efficiency to @xmath185 as is usually done . at @xmath186 , @xmath187 . for a ratio of @xmath188 ( solutions with @xmath189 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and a corresponding value of @xmath190 for outflowing regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) , we deduce a ratio @xmath191 that reaches up to @xmath192 in our solutions .",
    "therefore , provided that solutions with realistic cooling properties can be constructed with radiative efficiencies @xmath193 ( i.e. less than a hundredth of the fiducial @xmath147 value ) , it may be possible to explain the `` jet - power dominance '' of radiatively - inefficient accretion flows which has been recently emphasized by several authors ( e.g. nagar , falcke & wilson 2005 ; koerding et al .",

    "( 2006 ) .    in this context ,",
    "understanding how thermal outflows may relate to the relativistic jets of accreting black holes will likely be important .",
    "after all , outflow velocities decrease with radius as @xmath196 in our solutions ( by virtue of self - similarity ) , which is a rather unappealing feature .",

    "one of the best systems available to us for the study of radiatively - inefficient accretion flows ( and related outflows ) is sgr  a*. in recent years , the focus of theoretical work to interpret the rich set of data has in fact shifted to include a jet or outflow component ( e.g. falcke & biermann 1999 ; falcke & markoff 2000 ; melia & falcke 2001 ; markoff et al .",

    "other geometries have been proposed for other classes of systems ( e.g. elvis 2000 ) .",

    "the possibility that tangled magnetic fields strongly limit the efficiency of thermal conduction in a hot flow constitutes a major theoretical uncertainty for our models . in recent years",

    "1999 ) , but this remains somewhat of an open issue . if tangled magnetic fields were to limit the effective mean free paths in the hot flow to @xmath198 , conduction would likely still have important consequences for the flow structure and properties .",
    "if , on the other hand , tangled magnetic fields act to make @xmath199 , a much weaker role for conduction ( if any ) is to be expected .",
    "explicit numerical simulations with anisotropic conduction along field lines in an mhd turbulent medium could greatly help in settling this issue ( see , e.g. , cho & lazarian 2004 ; sharma et al .",
    "it should be emphasized that the energy transport mechanism which permits the existence of outflows in our solutions does not have to be thermal conduction .",
    "any form of heat transport ( e.g. turbulent , as emphasized by balbus 2004 ) acting like thermal conduction would have similar consequences for the flow .",
    "one of several limitations of our self - similar hot accretion flow solutions with conduction is their 1-temperature structure .",
    "narayan & yi ( 1995b ) have shown how crucial it is to account for the 2-temperature structure of the hot flow to obtain solutions with realistic cooling properties . in such solutions ,",
    "the expected decoupling of electron and ion temperatures in the inner regions of the hot flow would modify the role of conduction .",
    "for one thing , ions may be partially insulated from electron conduction .",
    "in addition , self - similarity is broken in the 2-temperature regime and the electron temperature profile flattens to a sub - virial slope ( e.g. narayan et al .",
    "in global solutions , conduction is expected to flatten both the polar and the radial temperature profiles ( while it only affects the polar profile in the radially self - similar solutions discussed here ) . furthermore ,",
    "if a saturated form of conduction is appropriate , the saturated flux should be reduced in regions of the flow where the electrons become relativistic , since their `` free streaming '' velocity then becomes limited by the speed of light .",
    "finally , the break - down of self - similarity implies that the radial contribution to conduction , which acts only to heat up the flow in our solutions , will have to be done at the expense of inner regions that will now be cooling by conduction .",
    "clearly , it will be interesting to see how all these effects combine with each other in global models of hot accretion flows with conduction .",
    "a potentially more fundamental limitation of our work may be the use of simple fluid equations to describe a weakly - collisional plasma obeying a more complex set of equations .",
    "for instance , balbus ( 2001 ) has argued that the dynamical structure of hot flows could be affected by the anisotropic character of conduction in the presence of magnetic fields ( see also parrish & stone 2005 ) , while quataert et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have emphasized additional effects due to the anisotropic pressure tensor present in the weakly - collisional regime ( see also sharma et al .",
    "2006 ) . on the other hand , it is possible that a scale analysis could justify the use of simpler fluid equations to describe the dynamics of the weakly - collisional magnetized plasma on the largest scales of interest in the context of hot accretion flows .",
    "such an analysis would clearly be valuable since essentially all the literature on hot accretion flows relies on collisional fluid equations ( magnetized or not ) .    in recent years",
    ", much emphasis has been put on reducing the rate at which gas is accreted by a central black hole , within a hot flow , either by arguing that a negative bernoulli constant is required for an accretion solution with imposed winds to be physically viable ( blandford & begelman 1999 ) or by invoking a gradual reduction in the rate of mass accretion in the flow due to the effects of convection ( narayan et al .",
    "2000 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000a ) .",
    "our results , combined with the possibility that conduction may be important in hot accretion flows , could pose a challenge to both of these scenarios .",
    "we have already seen that the sign of the bernoulli constant does not determine the existence of thermal outflows , or even discriminate between inflowing and outflowing regions , in our solutions with conduction .",
    "our solutions also show that a radially varying @xmath101 is not necessarily associated with the existence of such outflows .",
    "in addition , if conduction is important on all scales of interest in the hot flow , convection may be suppressed altogether when a displaced fluid element efficiently reaches thermal equilibrium with its environment through conduction .",
    "obviously , our results do not exclude the existence of other classes of spontaneously outflowing solutions with radially varying @xmath101 , density profiles deviating from the canonical @xmath200 , more realistic flow patterns allowing for non - zero latitudinal velocities , polar funnels , or a role for other radial and latitudinal energy / momentum transport mechanisms ( see , e.g. , the issues of adiabatic stability discussed in blandford & begelman 2004 , but also balbus 2001 for the diabatic case with anisotropic conduction and magnetic fields ) .",
    "it would be particularly interesting to contrast the study of these generalized solutions with the results for averaged flow properties emerging from simple hydrodynamical and mhd numerical simulations ( e.g. mckinney & gammie 2002 ; proga 2005 ) , in an effort to make the best use of these two complementarity approaches to the black hole accretion problem .",
    "if conduction is generally important in hot accretion flows around black holes , it could have additional interesting consequences besides the ones illustrated in our specific solutions .",
    "for instance , if the hot flow residing inside the capture radius around a black hole is able to heat up the ambient gas outside of that capture radius , the bondi rate of gas capture ( @xmath201 ) may be effectively reduced . while gruzinov ( 1998 ) invoked",
    "`` turbulent '' heat flows to achieve this , the weakly - collisional conditions discussed in  2 for several galactic nuclei suggest that this could be done by `` microscopic '' conduction itself .",

    "the conduction term in the energy equation becomes : @xmath222.\\ ] ]    returning to our analysis , there are still differences between our work and that of anderson ( 1987 ) , both in the formalism and in the results .",
    "anderson works in the limit of `` weak shear viscosity , '' with several viscous terms dropped from the dynamical equations ( as compared to ours ) .",
    "he adopts a polytropic equation of state , a prescription for viscosity which differs from shakura - sunyaev and there is no inertial term in his radial momentum equation . as a result",
    ", his set of differential equations is reduced to a third order system , as opposed to a seventh order one in our case . despite these technical differences ,",
    "our results are qualitatively consistent with many of his conclusions .",
    "differences appear mostly at the quantitative level , for instance in the rates of mass outflow ( which appear a few times larger in our solutions ) .",
    "one qualitative feature which has apparently been missed by anderson ( 1987 ) is the existence of solutions with conical outflow geometries in sub - regions of the parameter space .    from this comparison",
    ", we can safely conclude that many of the qualitative features exhibited by our solutions should be relatively robust to changes in the various prescriptions adopted ( e.g. conduction and viscosity ) .",
