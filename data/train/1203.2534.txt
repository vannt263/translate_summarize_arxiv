    "the fluxes at the two periods agree with each other within the uncertainty , indicating no appreciable variations in the flux .",

    "significant excess emission at wavelengths longer than 5@xmath10 is clearly seen and the detected flux densities at 9 and 18@xmath10 are 5 and 10 times larger than the photosphere , unambiguously indicating the presence of a warm and bright debris disk .      to examine the excess emission in detail , we subtract the estimated photospheric emission from the observed irs spectrum ( figure  [ fit_fused ] ) .",
    "the photosphere - subtracted spectrum shows two significant emission features centered at around 9 and 20@xmath10 .",
    "a weak feature at 16@xmath10 is also seen .",
    "a ubiquitous dust species family , silicate , which has spectral features around @xmath28 and @xmath29 , can be considered as a main carrier of the observed features at the first sight . however , sub-@xmath3-sized amorphous olivine and pyroxene commonly seen in celestial objects have features around 9.39.7@xmath10 and @xmath30 , which can not reproduce the observed spectrum completely . as an alternative carrier of the observed features around",
    "around 9 and 20@xmath10 , we consider amorphous silica ( silicon dioxide ) , which also has si - o and o - si - o modes and shows broad features at similar wavelengths to amorphous silicate .      to estimate the dust temperature and the species ,",
    "we perform a fit with an sed model that consists of blackbody emission , silicate and silica emission .",
    "the model flux density is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the solid angle of a blackbody representing the continuum emission from large dust ( @xmath33 in size ) , @xmath34 is the planck function with the temperatures @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the mass absorption coefficients of the dust , and @xmath37 s are the scaling factors proportional to the dust mass . for silicate ,",
    "we choose one from eight mass absorption coefficients ( amorphous olivine or pyroxene with the size of 0.1 , 1.0 , 1.5 , or 2.0@xmath10 ) computed from the optical constants of mgfesio@xmath38 and mg@xmath39fe@xmath39sio@xmath40 @xcite based the mie theory @xcite .",
    "we take the specific mass densities of both olivine and pyroxene as 3.3 g  @xmath41 . for silica , we choose one from fused quartz @xcite or annealed silica @xcite .",

    "we take the mass absorption coefficients of annealed silica and compute that of fused quartz for the shape of continuous ellipsoidal distribution @xcite from the optical constants measured in laboratories @xcite .",
    "we search for parameters minimizing the reduced @xmath42 using the data between 5 and 35@xmath10 with respect to each of @xmath32 and @xmath37 s .    at first",
    ", we find that a combination of blackbody , 1.5@xmath10-sized amorphous pyroxene and fused quartz provides the best fit ( figure  [ fit_fused ] ) .",
    "the second best combination is blackbody , 1.5@xmath10-sized amorphous pyroxene , and annealed silica .",
    "the best - fit model spectra and parameters of these combinations are shown in figure  [ fit_fused ] and table  [ fitparameter ] , respectively .",
    "the models with the two combinations of dust components seem fairly good , suggesting that it is a robust conclusion that silica dust is one of the major dust species of debris dust together with amorphous pyroxene dust around hd  15407a .",
    "the model spectrum with annealed silica explains the observed small feature at @xmath43 while it produces a sharp extra emission at @xmath44 , which is not observed . since fused quartz and annealed silica have similar but slightly different band features , we perform a tuned fit assuming that the silica component is a mixture of fused quartz and annealed silica , and that the silicate is 1.5@xmath10-sized amorphous pyroxene with @xmath45 .",
    "the best - fit model spectrum and parameters in this dust combination are shown in figure  [ fit_fused ] and table  [ fitparameter ] , respectively .",
    "since this model provides the least @xmath42 among the models considered here , we adopt this model ( @xmath46  k and @xmath47  k ) in the following discussion .",
    "the masses of amorphous pyroxene and silica dust around hd  15407a are derived as @xmath48 and @xmath49  kg , respectively , assuming that the dust emission is optically thin .",
    "the derived total mass of the fine dust in the warm debris disk is @xmath50  kg @xmath0 .",
    "this value does not include the mass of the blackbody dust , which is supposed to come from large - sized ( @xmath33 in size ) grains and rubbles .",
    "we estimate the distances from the central star of the blackbody and the 1.5@xmath10-sized amorphous pyroxene dust from the dust temperatures and emissivities assuming that the grains are in radiative equilibrium around a f3v star with the luminosity of @xmath51 . the derived distance for the blackbody and the pyroxene dust is 0.6 and 1.0  au , respectively , which corresponds to a terrestrial ( rocky ) planet region .",
    "the silica dust must contact with other dust species to keep its temperature high since it is transparent in the visible wavelength and the stellar radiation solely can not heat silica grains to the observed temperature . thus , although the distance of silica from the star in radiative equilibrium is @xmath52  au , the silica dust is considered to be located at a region similar to those of pyroxene and blackbody dust .",
    "only upper limits are available for the far - infrared ( fir ) flux densities from _ iras _ observations and the extension of the debris disk can not be estimated .",
    "high spatial resolution observations and fir  radio observations are required for further examination of the radial distribution of dust around the star .",
    "the fractional luminosity ( @xmath53 ) of the warm debris disk is estimated as @xmath2 from the fitting of the sed .",
    "figure 3 plots the maximum fractional luminosity @xmath54 predicted by a simple model of the steady - state evolution of debris disks produced by collisions @xcite with the stellar parameters of hd  15407a and the derived dust disk radii ( @xmath55 and 1.0  au for blackbody and pyroxene dust , respectively ) .",
    "the ratio of @xmath56 of the debris disk around hd  15407a is larger than @xmath57 if we assume 2.1  gyr as the age of hd  15407a as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the observed fractional luminosity of hd  15407a system can not be accounted for by a simple steady - state model .",
    "even when we assume the age of @xmath7  myr suggested by @xcite , @xmath56 is about @xmath58 and significant enhancement of @xmath59 compared to @xmath54 is secure . to date several warm debris disks",
    "are known , whose fractional luminosities are much larger than the steady - state model and in which transient events are suggested to be responsible ; e.g.  @xcite estimated @xmath60@xmath58 for bd  + 20  307 , hd  72905 , @xmath61  corvi , and hd  69830 , which possess warm dust at @xmath62@xmath63  au .",
    "hd  15407a is one of the highest-@xmath56 debris disks among these and seems a non - typical warm debris disk .",
    "the disk is not a protoplanetary one since h@xmath64 , h@xmath65 , and h@xmath66 lines are seen in absorption , not in emission , in the oao / hides optical spectrum of the star , which suggests the absence of gas accretion around the star .",
    "hd  15407 is a possible binary system and hd  15407b might disturb circumstellar material around hd  15407a dynamically . at present",
    "there is no theoretical model of debris disk evolution for a binary system in terms of fractional luminosity .",
    "however , the study of the stability zone in a binary system by @xcite suggests that material at @xmath67 and @xmath68  au from hd  15407a is dynamically stable for cases where the eccentricity of the system is 0.0 and 0.8 , respectively .",
    "the radiation pressure should blow out @xmath3-sized small grains , which show prominent feature in the mir , in the vicinity of a f3 star in a short ( @xmath69  years ) time scale .",
    "it can not be concluded only from available data whether or not hd  15407a shows a time variation of its feature emission .",
    "time variation in the continuum flux level of the excess is not seen in the observations after _ iras _ , which can be accounted for since grains responsible for the continuum excess are large ( @xmath70 ) and thus have long ( @xmath71  years ) lifetime .",
    "monitoring observations of mir spectrum would be important to examine the actual lifetime of small dust around hd  15407a .",
    "if dust features towards hd  15047a do not change over decades , mechanisms that retain the fine grains near the star should be playing a role in hd  15407a , such as shepherding of dust around a planet as in saturn @xcite and uranus @xcite or dust capture in a resonance as in the circumsolar dust ring @xcite , which are in effect in the solar system .",
    "alternatively the fine dust may be produced violently and continuously over decades around hd  15407a .",
    "it should be noted that the @xcite model does not assume the presence of planet and trapping dust in a resonance in a planetary system .",
    "there is no evidence of a planet orbiting around hd  15407a at present .",
    "but if trapping of dust takes place efficiently , the predicted fractional luminosity from the model may be different than in debris disks without planets .",
    "the mineralogical characteristics of the detected dust provide a clue for the origin of the debris dust . in the solar system , silica is one of the most abundant minerals in the earth s crust .",
    "the presence of amorphous silica is also suggested from the analysis of the comet 81p / wild 2 dust sample retrieved by the stardust mission @xcite .",
    "the presence of annealed silica dust in the protoplanetary disk around several t tauri stars ( ttss ) has been indicated in their _ spitzer _ mir spectra @xcite . however , silica is not a major constituent of the interstellar medium since the expected 9@xmath10 feature is not seen in the interstellar medium towards the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the presence of silica - like dust has also been suggested in debris disks .",
    "an almost equivalent amount of @xmath3-sized amorphous pyroxene and fused quartz are detected towards hd  15407a in addition to the blackbody component .",
    "ground - based observations of @xmath72@xmath73 spectroscopy indicate the presence of the @xmath74-peaked broad feature which is attributable to amorphous silica around the 100  myr - old g0 field star hd  23514 @xcite .",
    "_ spitzer_/irs spectroscopy reveals the presence of abundant amorphous silica dust around the a0v star hd  172555 whose age is estimated as @xmath75 myr @xcite .",
    "detections of silica among protoplanetary disks around ttss , debris disks , and the solar system suggest that silica might be ubiquitously present through the planet formation processes . debris disk stars with silica dust share a common habit that they show excesses emission in the near - infrared ( @xmath76 ) , suggesting the presence of very warm dust in the vicinity of the stars .",
    "the presence of very warm dust might be important for silica grains , which are almost transparent in the optical wavelength and thus needed to be heated by contact with other dust species thermally and emit in the mir .",
    "it is widely accepted that debris dust is produced from collisions of planetesimals .",
    "therefore , if a large amount of silica - rich planetesimals around hd  15407a collide with each other actively , the presence of abundant silica dust around hd  15407a could be accounted for .",
    "although the origin of silica - rich planetesimals is still an open question , a breakup of a large differentiated rocky body may be a likely possibility . a similar mechanism has been proposed as an origin of the enstatite - rich bright debris disk around hd  165014 @xcite .    as a probable source of silica dust around hd  172555 , in which abundant sio gas is also detected , giant hypervelocity",
    "( @xmath77  km s@xmath78 ) impact between large rocky planetesimals is suggested by @xcite .",
    "it may be similar to the one that formed the moon ( giant impact ) or the one that stripped the surface crustal material off of mercury s surface .",
    "the comparable silica - to - silicate ratio in @xmath3-sized small dust around hd  15407a suggests a similar origin of the silica dust with that of hd  172555 .",
    "this also seems harmonic with the large fractional luminosity of hd  15407a s debris , which may be connected with a transient event .",
    "however , the presence of sio gas around hd  15407a is not confirmed in its _",
    "spitzer_/irs spectrum .",
    "assuming that sio gas is really absent around hd  15407a , a substantial time ( @xmath79@xmath58  yr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) should have elapsed after the impact and sio gas should have disappeared due to the process of re - condensation even if a hypervelocity impact might have occurred and have produced silica - rich dust around hd  15407a .",
    "taking account of the short lifetime of @xmath3-sized dust , dust trapping and/or continuous dust production by collisional grinding of the large rubbles are required after the possible impact .",
    "further theoretical studies in addition to observations with high spatial resolution and wide wavelength coverage will provide hints on the possible linkage between the large infrared excess , the dynamical evolution , and the possible transient event of the intriguing debris disk around hd  15407a .",
