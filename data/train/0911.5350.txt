    "3.0 ) in extremely low luminosity dwarf spheroidal galaxies is changing our perspective on the early chemical enrichment within these objects , the formation of the outer regions of the milky way halo , and the role of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsph ) within the @xmath10cdm paradigm of the manner in which the milky way formed .    initial observations of the brighter dsph ( helmi et al .  2006 , and references therein ) led to the conclusion that dsph contained no stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath9 3.0 , while detailed studies of relative abundances ( in particular [ @xmath5/fe ] ) showed patterns that were unlike those of galactic halo stars in the solar neighborhood ( venn et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ; see also tolstoy , hill , & tosi 2009 ) .",
    "the paucity of brighter milky way dsph and their chemical relative abundances seem at odds with the cdm paradigm ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ) and the concept that these systems are the building blocks of at least part of the galaxy s halo .",
    "the recent identification of several `` ultra - faint '' systems , with luminosities many orders of magnitude fainter than those of the classical dsph , through analyses of the imaging data from the sloan digital sky survey ( e.g.  belokurov et al .  2006 , 2007 ) has revitalized discussions of satellite luminosity and mass functions .",
    "further , these ultra - faint systems contain extremely low - metallicity stars ( kirby et al .",
    "2008 ; norris et al .",
    "2008 ) , perhaps redressing the apparent deficit in brighter dsph .",
    "arguably even more interesting than their relevance as building blocks is to understand the galaxies themselves .",
    "are they the first objects ?",
    "did they cause reionization ?",
    "what do they tell us of the first stars ? what was the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) at near zero metallicity ? how are the faintest dsph related to more luminous dsph and the milky way ?    in a study of several ultra - faint dsph , kirby et al .",
    "( 2008 ) first reported stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath11 ( with metallicities as low as [ fe / h ] @xmath12 ) , based on moderate - resolution spectra in the range 83008500 , while norris et al .",
    "( 2008 ) from multi - object spectroscopy of the botes  i dsph found a similar result , with the most metal - poor star having [ fe / h ] @xmath13 based on the caii k line ( 3933 ) in moderate resolution blue spectra .",
    "more recently , frebel et al .  ( 2009 ) have obtained the first detailed elemental abundances , based on high - resolution , high @xmath1 spectra , of extremely metal - poor stars in the ultra - faint systems , with observations of com ber and u ma ii ( m@xmath14 respectively ) .",
    "of the six stars studied , one has [ fe / h ] @xmath15 , and another @xmath16 .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result of their investigation is that in these stars [ @xmath5/fe ] is similar to that found in the bulk of galactic halo stars .",
    "that is to say , these low metallicity stars in these faint satellite galaxies were apparently enriched by sne from a similar stellar imf to that which enriched their milky way counterparts .",
    "the most metal - poor  and possibly oldest  stars in the more luminous dsph also show the same level of enhancement of the @xmath5-elements ( e.g. koch et al .  2008 ) .",
    "these results stand in some contrast to results at higher abundance , in which regime the dsph member stars have significantly lower levels of [ @xmath5/fe ] than seen in field halo stars of the same iron abundance ( e.g.  venn et al .",
    "2004 ) , plausibly reflecting the more extended star formation and self - enrichment in the dsph in contrast to the field halo ( unavane , wyse & gilmore 1996 ) .",
    "the ultra - faint systems have sufficiently low luminosities and low metallicities that one might observe the anticipated signatures of enrichment by single type ii supernovae , perhaps even by population  iii massive stars .    the botes  i system was discovered by belokurov et al .  ( 2006 ) and is an ultra - faint dsph ( m@xmath3 , luminosity @xmath17  l@xmath18 ; martin et al .",

    "given the complicated trend and scatter in [ ba / fe ] values seen in the figure , and the paucity of stars below [ fe / h ] = 3.5 , more data would be required to address this issue ; and ( 5 ) for the representative @xmath5-elements , the [ mg / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] values of boo@xmath21137 are both higher , by approximately twice their errors of measurement , than the cayrel et al .",

    "is that all of the boo@xmath21137 relative abundances are larger that those of the galactic halo at the [ fe / h ] value of boo@xmath21137 .",
    "is this significant ? to address this problem we proceed as follows .",
    "rows ( 1)(6 ) , columns ( 1)(7 ) , of table 4 present the relevant input data : columns ( 1)(3 ) contain the atomic species involved , the rms scatter for material having [ fe / h ] @xmath9 3.0 about the regression lines in figure  6 ( from cayrel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and the present work ) , and the resulting values of the relative abundances of the galactic halo at [ fe / h]@xmath61 = 3.66 .",
    "columns ( 4)(7 ) show for boo@xmath21137 its relative abundance and error , the distance it falls above the halo line , and that distance expressed in units of the star s abundance error .",
    "we then use monte carlo analysis to address the following question : if one draws putative stars at random from a gaussian distribution for a galactic halo having the abundance dispersions in column ( 2 ) , and superimposes on that a random gaussian error corresponding to the observational errors of boo@xmath21137 in column ( 5 ) , what fraction of the resulting abundances would be at least as large as the observed distance of boo@xmath21137 above the halo lines ( presented in column ( 6 ) ) .",
    "the results are presented in the final column of table 4 .",
    "one sees in rows ( 1)(6 ) that , taken individually , the probabilities of boo@xmath21137 lying above the galactic halo values are in the range 0.030.14 , broadly consistent with the results in column ( 7 ) of the table .",
    "the most stringent condition , as might be expected , comes from the average of the @xmath5-elements in the sixth row : the likelihood of finding the observed enhancement of the averaged @xmath5-elements is 0.017 .",
    "one might also ask the question : what is the probability of _ all _ of the boo@xmath21137 [ mg / fe ] , [ si / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] , [ ti i / fe ] , and [ ti ii / fe ] values falling above their respective galactic halo lines .",
    "the answer , based on the monte carlo simulations , is that the fraction of relative abundances as large as seen for the five @xmath5 species is 3  @xmath28  10@xmath62 .",
    "this assumes , however , that the abundances of each of the above species is independent of all of the others , which is not the case , given the observed propensity of several of them to often have correlated behaviour .",
    "an example of such correlation is highlighted in figure  [ fig : alphas ] where the red star represents the data of cayrel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for cs22968014 , which for all species fall below the least - squares lines of best fit to the cayrel et al",

    "( we note for completeness that mcwilliam et al .",
    "( 1995 ) also analyzed cs22968014 , and first reported the low relative abundances of its @xmath5-elements . )",
    "the reader will see other examples of this effect in figure  [ fig : alphas ] .",
    "given such correlated behavior , we shall not consider further the test in this paragraph , which is inappropriate .",
    "the reader may recall from  3.2 that we found small systematic differences between the relative abundances of cayrel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and those we obtained using our techniques . those relevant here are @xmath6[mg i / fe ] = 0.049 , @xmath6[ca i / fe ] = 0.008 , @xmath6[ti i / fe ] = 0.033 , and @xmath6[ti ii / fe ] = 0.019 , in the sense [ cayrel et al .",

    "if we adjust the results in column ( 4 ) for these four species and [ @xmath5/fe ] to take the corrections into account , the fraction of monte carlo simulations having [ @xmath5/fe ] lying at or above the observed boo@xmath21137 values then increases to 0.024 .",

    "inspection of figure  [ fig : alphas ] suggests that given the decreasing sample size as one moves to lower abundances one should proceed with caution .",
    "for example , there are only five objects in the figure that have [ fe / h ] @xmath9 3.5 .",
    "more data are clearly needed before one regard these estimates as definitive .    with this caveat in mind , we note that these dispersions for [ fe / h ] @xmath9 3.1 are somewhat larger than reported for metal - poor dwarfs in the range 3.0 @xmath4 [ fe / h ] @xmath4 2.0 : by magain ( 1989 ) ",

    "( 2002 ) , the dispersion of these elements at lowest abundance places strong constraints on the yields of sne , the imf , and galactic chemical enrichment at the earliest times .",
    "we shall return to the implications of this point below .",
    "we note in concluding this section that feltzing et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have recently reported an anomalously large value of [ mg / ca ] = 0.73 ( at [ fe / h ] = 2.0 ) for one of seven stars they have observed in botes  i ( all with [ fe / h ] @xmath64 3.0 ) .",
    "the value we obtain for boo@xmath21137 is [ mg / ca ] = 0.05 , which is not too dissimilar from the mean value of 0.11 @xmath27 0.06 that one obtains for their other six stars .",
    "what are the implications from figures  [ fig : xfe ] and [ fig : alphas ] for the manner in which chemical enrichment occurred in botes  i ? as noted in  4.2 above , the initial impression of overall similarity between the abundances of boo@xmath21137 and those of the galactic halo in figure  [ fig : xfe ] is perhaps not too surprising .",
    "intuitively , one might expect that for abundances as low as [ fe / h ] = 3.7 , and an old stellar population , it is more likely to find abundance patterns driven by enrichment from core - collapse supernovae from massive - star progenitors , without the later modification by type sn ia .",
    "this of course will depend on the rate and duration of star formation  only the earliest stars will have enrichment from only core - collapse supernovae , and , should galactic chemical enrichment occur for long enough , one will see the sn  ia signature downturn of [ @xmath5/fe ] vs [ fe / h ] to more solar - like values as one moves from lower to higher [ fe / h ] . in the sculptor and draco dsph , for example",
    ", the onset of the decrease is evident already at [ fe / h ] @xmath0 2.0 , compared with 1.0 for the galactic halo ( see e.g. tolstoy et al .",
    "2009 , their figure 11 , and cohen & huang 2009 , respectively ) .",
    "the chemical evolution of botes  i probably involved a relatively short - lived epoch of star formation and self - enrichment in a dark matter dominated potential , terminated by catastrophic gas loss in ( type  ii)-supernova - driven winds ( saito 1979 ; wyse & silk 1985 ; dekel & silk 1986 ) in which the bulk of the initial ( gaseous ) baryonic mass was lost .",
    "as noted earlier , the color - magnitude diagram of botes  i ( belokurov et al .",
    "2006 ) is consistent with an old , metal - poor population .",
    "forming stars would then have been chemically enriched by only core - collapse supernovae , resulting , for example , in enhanced [ o / fe ] and [ @xmath5/fe ] compared with the solar value .",
    "the actual value of the relative enhancement depends on the mix of masses of the sne progenitors , since model sne yields show that more massive progenitors produce relatively more intermediate - mass elements than iron for many elements , so that an imf biased towards the most massive stars will , with good sampling of the imf and good mixing so that an imf - average is achieved in star - forming regions , provide higher mean [ o / fe ] , [ @xmath5/fe ] , etc .",
    "( see e.g.  wyse & gilmore 1992 ; argast et al .",
    "2002 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "2006 ) . the low stellar - mass and low level of enrichment of botes  i mean that it would not be surprising if either the underlying imf were not well - sampled in star - forming regions , or that they were not well - mixed , or both .",
    "our demonstration that the @xmath5-elements appear enhanced with respect to iron in boo-1137 , relative to the mean of the metal - poor halo stars , by @xmath65/fe ] @xmath0 0.2 is consistent with enrichment of the material from which boo@xmath21137 formed being biased towards the ejecta of sne with more massive progenitors than the bulk of the metal - poor galactic halo .",
    "this could reflect a biased underlying galaxy - scale imf , or incomplete mixing and/or poor sampling of an invariant imf , or be due to the shorter lifetimes of the most massive core - collapse progenitors in an invariant imf .",

    "this is the most conservative of the three suggested reasons behind the elemental ratio enhancements we gave above , and we advocate this conclusion .",
