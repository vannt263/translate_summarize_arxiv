    "x - ray based cluster mass determinations generally assume that morphologically - symmetric ( i.e. non - merging ) clusters are isothermal .",
    "however , this accepted wisdom has recently been challenged by markevitch et al .",
    "( 1998 ; hereafter m98 ) who found evidence for decreasing temperature profiles in a sample of nearby hot clusters ( @xmath7 kev ) observed with asca .",
    "a subsample of 17 regular / symmetric clusters displayed remarkably similar temperature profiles ( when normalized and scaled by the virial radius ) consistent with @xmath8^{-3 \\beta ( \\gamma-1)/2}$ ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the typical decrease is therefore a factor of @xmath112 in going from 1 to 6 core radii ( or .09 to 0.5 virial radii ) .",
    "this result remains controversial as three subsequent studies of large samples of clusters concluded that the majority of cluster temperature profiles show little , or no , decrease with radius ( irwin , bregman , & evrard 1999 ; white 2000 ; irwin & bregman 2000 ) .",
    "most recently , de grandi & molendi ( 2002 ) have presented a composite temperature profile based on _",
    "beppo_sax data which exhibits an isothermal core and then decreases quickly .",
    "here we present results derived from recent high - resolution numerical simulations and show that there appears to be a universal temperature profile which declines significantly even within half a virial radius of the cluster center .",
    "we also show that these simulated profiles are consistent with the most recent cluster observations except in the very innermost regions of a cluster ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the simulated clusters used in this work are part of an ongoing project to create extensive numerical `` catalogs '' of clusters .",
    "this catalog has already been used to investigate the effect of large - scale structure on weak gravitational lensing mass estimates ( metzler et al .  1999 , 2001 ) and the role of `` temperature bias '' in sunyaev - zeldovich determinations of the hubble constant ( lin , norman , & bryan 2001 ) .",
    "the cluster simulation data are available on - line at the simulated cluster archive : http://sca.ncsa.uiuc.edu ( norman et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the cosmological model adopted for the bulk of the simulations is a current `` best - guess '' flat universe with a cosmological constant ( @xmath0cdm ) and parameters : @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the 25 most - massive clusters in the 256 h@xmath1 mpc volume have been fully analyzed and comprise the @xmath0cdm sample used in this work . for comparison ,",
    "a smaller sample of 10 scdm clusters has been simulated in the same volume ( and with the same random - seed for the initial fluctuations ) with parameters : @xmath14 and @xmath15    an initial low - resolution simulation was used to identify clusters in the 256 h@xmath1 mpc volume and then high - resolution simulations were performed which evolved the entire volume but adaptively refined the region from which a specific cluster formed .",
    "the root , or level 0 ( l0 ) , grid covers the entire periodic domain with @xmath16 cells .",
    "the lagrangian volume of a given cluster is further refined with two levels of subgrids ( l1 and l2 ) , each with twice the spatial resolution and eight times the mass resolution of the previous one , in order to refine the initial conditions within this volume .",
    "an additional five levels of refinement are introduced adaptively and automatically within the l2 grid as the simulation progresses .",
    "the clusters form from particles on the l2 grid which have a mass of @xmath17h@xmath18m@xmath19 .",
    "the best spatial resolution is 15.6 h@xmath1kpc .",
    "the cosmological adaptive - mesh refinement ( amr ) code used here is described in detail in bryan ( 1999 ) and norman & bryan ( 1999 ) .",
    "briefly , this code solves the equations of hydrodynamics using the higher - order accurate piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ; collela & woodward 1984 ) and employs an adaptive particle - mesh algorithm ( using second - order accurate tsc interpolation ) for the dark matter particles .",
    "the eulerian hydrodynamics algorithm exhibits several crucial characteristics including excellent shock - capturing ( within 1 - 2 zones with correct entropy generation ) , and equal accuracy in high or low density regions ( for the same zone size ) .",
    "the key component of the code is its use of structured adaptive mesh refinement ( berger & collela 1989 ) in order to enhance resolution when and where needed .",
    "our code was tested as part of the santa barbara cluster comparison project ( frenk et al .",
    "1999 ) in which 12 groups simulated a coma - like cluster using a variety of codes and resolutions our results ( curves labeled  bryan \" ) are among the highest resolution results presented in that paper ( central resolution of @xmath20 kpc ) .",
    "we agree well with the highest resolution @xmath21 results except that our central temperature is somewhat higher , and our radial temperature profiles continue to rise at small radii rather than flattening within @xmath22 kpc .",
    "frenk et al .",
    "( 1999 ) note that this discrepancy is more or less present in all the grid - based codes but provide no explanation . to check whether this might be a result of numerical resolution or algorithms employed",
    ", we recomputed the santa barbara cluster with low , medium and high resolution initial conditions corresponding to @xmath23 and @xmath24 particles / cells in the l0 grid , and l7 resolutions equal to 15.6 , 7.8 , and 3.9@xmath25 kpc , respectively . instead of ppm",
    ", we also tested the artificial viscosity , finite - difference algorithm for gas dynamics used in the zeus codes ( stone & norman 1992 ) . in all cases",
    "we found the temperature profile agreed with our result presented in frenk et al . to within a few percent at all radii ;",
    "i.e. , our temperature profile has converged .",
    "note also that there is excellent agreement between our results for the santa barbara cluster and those of a new , completely independent amr code ( see fig.1 of kravtsov , klypin , & hoffman 2001 ) .",
    "for each simulation , clusters were identified in the refined subvolume and their virial radii ( r@xmath26 ) determined as the radius at which the mean enclosed density was @xmath27 times the critical density ( at @xmath28 , @xmath29 for @xmath0cdm and 178 for scdm ; e.g. , bryan & norman 1998 ) . projected gas density , x - ray surface brightness , and emission - weighted gas temperature images ( 5 h@xmath1 mpc on a side )",
    "were constructed for each cluster assuming a raymond - smith spectrum with metallicity 0.3 solar in the ( 1.5 - 11.0 ) kev bandpass used in the analysis of m98 .",
    "2d radial temperature profiles ( centered on the x - ray peak ) were determined from the temperature images and a global temperature ( t@xmath30 ) calculated by summing the emission - weighted temperature within 1.0 h@xmath1mpc .",
    "this procedure was intended to duplicate , as closely as possible , that of m98 .    the distribution of cluster temperatures ( t@xmath30 ) , virial masses ( m@xmath26 ) , and virial radii ( @xmath31 ) in the @xmath0cdm sample are shown in fig .",
    "the complex , non - isothermal structure of the clusters is shown in the thumbnail images in fig .",
    "[ tempmaps ] .",
    "although complicated , a number of patterns can be discerned : the core of the cluster is generally hotter than the outskirts ; low - temperature  holes \" correspond to infalling groups with lower masses and hence , lower temperatures .",
    "in addition , a few clusters show strong shocks due to recent major mergers , but these are generally not spherically symmetric and tend to be of order a mpc from the core and so might be difficult to detect observationally .",
    "the evolution of the temperature structure and the significant differences between scdm and @xmath0cdm clusters at @xmath32 will be discussed in a forthcoming paper ( loken et al .",
    "2002 ) .    the key result of this current paper concerns the 2d temperature profiles shown in figs .  [ temp_all ] and [ profs ] .",
    "a given cluster s temperature profile is normalized by its global temperature ( @xmath33 ) and the radius is scaled by the cluster s virial radius .",
    "note that the resulting profiles are remarkably similar even when comparing @xmath0cdm and scdm clusters .",
    "in addition , the majority of the profiles fall within the band drawn by m98 ( reproduced in figs .",
    "[ temp_all ] and [ profs ] ) to encompass the majority of their data points and error bars .",
    "[ profs ] is a``tidied '' version of fig .",
    "[ temp_all ] which includes only those clusters whose x - ray appearance is fairly regular and symmetric .",
    "this is exactly the same selection cut imposed by m98 and others searching for a general temperature profile .",
    "however , even the excluded profiles are , for the most part , not dramatically different in general appearance .",
    "the discarded profiles generally have strong bumps or wiggles at the radius corresponding to a merging subcluster .",
    "13 of 22 @xmath0cdm cluster profiles are kept in fig .",
    "[ profs ] ( similarly , m98 find that 17 of their 33 clusters are symmetric ) .",
    "however , only 3 of 10 scdm cluster are sufficiently regular ; presumably this reflects the fact that clusters are still forming at @xmath28 in an scdm universe .",
    "we find that the temperature profiles in fig .",
    "[ profs ] can be well fit with an expression of the form : @xmath34 ^{-\\delta}$ ] , where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 on the radial range @xmath38 .",
    "m98 chose instead to fit their temperature profiles with a polytropic equation of state : @xmath39^{-3 \\beta ( \\gamma-1)/2}$ ] . using this form on the same radial range as m98 , @xmath40 , we find @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ( assuming @xmath44 ) .",
    "m98 found a very similar fit : @xmath9 and @xmath45 .",
    "we note , however , that the shape of the fit changes when the fitted range is extended to @xmath38 in which case : @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this sensitivity to the choice of fitting range appears to be due to the fact that the scatter in the data decreases for @xmath49 and suggests that observations must extend to near the virial radius in order to converge on the true , universal temperature profile .    though the two forms for the temperature profile both yield acceptable fits , we prefer the first form for two reasons .",
    "first , the key difference between the two fits is that the polytropic form turns over and begins to level - off at small radii while the first one continues to rise ( just as in fig .  [ profs ] ) .",
    "if the fits are extended within @xmath50 , then the polytropic form yields an increasingly poor fit .",
    "it is difficult to draw any strong conclusions , however , because this is exactly the region within which non - adiabatic effects would become important and , as well , our limiting resolution is @xmath51 for a typical cluster .    the second argument against the polytropic form is the fact that it is not well - motivated physically . in fact , it can be derived by assuming that the gas is : _ isothermal _ , follows a @xmath52-model for the x - ray surface brightness , and obeys the _ polytropic _ equation of state , @xmath53 .",
    "clearly , this is an inconsistent derivation .",
    "moreover , the assumption of a polytropic equation of state amounts to assuming that the gas is isentropic which clearly contradicts the outwardly rising entropy profiles which we and others find from simulations ( e.g. , frenk et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "recently , de grandi & molendi ( 2002 ) have analyzed _",
    "beppo_sax data for a sample of 21 clusters with and without cooling flows .",
    "they concluded that non - cooling flow cluster temperature profiles are flat in the innermost regions ( @xmath54 ) and that the profiles of both types of clusters decline rapidly with radius outside @xmath55 .",
    "their mean data points for the two types of clusters are shown in fig  [ beppo ] along with profiles for two of our clusters which are discussed in  [ physics ] .",
    "again , the shape and normalization of the observational profiles agree well with the simulations though the flat innermost region may signal the need for some additional physics in the simulations ( e.g. de grandi & molendi 2002 ) .",
    "the present adiabatic simulations are the first step in a planned series of simulations which will incorporate non - adiabatic physical effects .",
    "thus they form a baseline sample for evaluating the significance of additional physics .",
    "though potentially important processes like cooling and galaxy feedback are not included in the simulations for the adiabatic cluster catalog , we would expect any effects to be strongly limited to the cluster core and to have very little effect in the outer regions .",
    "these expectations now appear justified by our most recent non - adiabatic simulations .",
    "two of the clusters in our sample have been re - run with identical parameters and resolution in order to include the effects of radiative cooling ( motl et al . 2002 ) .",
    "these new runs are compared with the adiabatic simulations in fig .",
    "[ cooling ] .",
    "the temperature profiles of the cooling clusters are scaled as in the adiabatic case except that we omit the inner core ( @xmath56 ) when calculating the global temperature . in addition",
    ", one of us ( mln ) has recently performed a higher resolution ( 7.8@xmath25kpc ) simulation including both radiative cooling , and type ii supernovae feedback .",
    "this cluster , which has the same initial parameters as the santa barbara comparison cluster ( frenk et al .",
    "1999 ) is also included on the figure for comparison .",
    "we caution that this is just a first simulation and hence the full parameter space of star formation and feedback parameters has not been explored .",
    "note that , as expected , the temperature profile of the cooling cluster is virtually indistinguishable from that of the adiabatic cluster outside of the cool core ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that our conclusions about declining cluster temperature profiles are not the result of neglecting radiative cooling .",
    "perhaps even more interesting is the higher - resolution simulation which incorporates both cooling and feedback .",
    "again , the shape of the corresponding temperature profile is remarkably similar to the other cases . fig .",
    "[ cooling ] makes clear that the non - adiabatic profiles also fit well within the observational bounds determined by m98    electron thermal conduction , which is not included in our simulations , would have to be a significant fraction of its spitzer value in order to erase temperature gradients on the scale we observe .",
    "the suppression of thermal conduction by tangled cluster magnetic fields is an open area of research which has , as yet , reached no firm conclusion ( chandran & cowley , 1998 ; malyshkin & kulsrud , 2001 ) .",
    "we have used our volume - limited catalogs of numerically - simulated clusters to demonstrate that both @xmath0cdm and scdm clusters follow a universal cluster temperature profile with @xmath58 ^{-1.6}$ ] .",
    "this temperature profile agrees very well with the observationally - determined profile of m98 and the more recent _",
    "beppo_sax data of degrandi & molendi ( 2002 ) ( fig .",
    "[ beppo ] ) .",
    "our simulations also reveal a wealth of extremely complex and non - isothermal temperature structure ( fig .  [ tempmaps ] ) which current x - ray telescopes may be able to probe .",
    "interestingly , our preliminary analysis suggests that the large - scale cluster temperature structure ( particularly for @xmath59 ) is a potential discriminator of cosmological model .",
    "our current adiabatic catalogs of clusters were intended to serve as a well - defined baseline sample for statistical and individual comparison with both observed clusters and with future simulations that include additional physical effects .",
    "remarkably , our initial simulations of clusters with more realistic physics ( radiative cooling and galaxy feedback ) give rise to temperature profiles ( fig .  [ cooling ] ) that agree well with our adiabatic profile and suggest that this truly is a universal cluster temperature profile .      this work has been partially supported by nasa grant nag5 - 7404 and nsf grant ast-9803137 .",
