    "the temporal flux variability from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , detectable in nearly all wavelength regimes , contains information on the underlying emission processes and source geometry that is otherwise difficult to probe @xcite .",
    "however , precise details of the physical mechanism generating the observed nuclear variability in agn remain unclear @xcite .",
    "current and future large - scale photometric time - domain surveys have motivated many recent studies of the optical broadband variability properties of various agn subclasses using large numbers of well - sampled light curves .",
    "this has been especially useful for agn identification and selection @xcite .    beyond the optical , large - scale surveys of agn variability",
    "have been pursued at many other wavelengths , including the radio @xcite , ultraviolet @xcite , and @xmath2-ray regimes @xcite .",
    "fewer studies of agn variability have focused on the infrared ( ir ) , due in part to the expectation that non - variable dust and the host galaxy dominate the emission at these wavelengths ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "explanations of agn variability in the optical as due to localized temperature fluctuations in inhomogeneous accretion disks @xcite or global accretion rate changes @xcite predict little flux variability from disk emission in the ir .",
    "reprocessing of variable optical emission by a dusty torus has been suggested by @xcite as a possible cause for the nir variability , although the time - lags between the optical and nir are difficult to detect .",
    "for example @xcite have shown small time lags between nir and x - ray data for the agn 3c273 , with the nir variability leading the x - ray by @xmath41.5 days , implying this nir variability originates near the nucleus .    a study of nir variability in the spitzer deep wide - field survey botes field by @xcite showed that although only 1.1% of objects appear to be variable in the near - ir ( nir ) , the vast majority of the variable objects were agn .",
    "small samples of agn monitored in both the optical and nir have shown that while nuclear variability is prevalent , the amplitude of variations decreases towards longer wavelengths .",
    "for example , @xcite have produced realistic models of the optical to nir variability for ngc 4151 , which show a small amplitude time lag and decreasing amplitude variability as a function of wavelength . however , this is not true for blazars , whose nir flux is dominated by non - thermal emission from a relativistic jet , rather than circum - nuclear dust which is not expected to be non - variable @xcite .",
    "recent results from optical / nir monitoring of @xmath5 @xmath2-ray blazars have shown that flat - spectrum radio quasars are more variable in the nir than in the optical @xcite . @xcite",
    "have used 7 year photometric light curves of 7 blazars , spanning the optical to nir bands ( @xmath6 ) , to find that variability amplitudes increase with wavelength for these objects .    in this study",
    "we search for nir variability of luminous agn using well sampled light curves from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) calibration data , finding one highly variable blazar ( sdssj14584479 + 3720215 ) .",
    "we explore the utility of nir variability - based selection of agn , including its use in identifying counterparts to @xmath5 @xmath2-ray sources .",
    "we also study the nature of non - agn contaminants with similar nir colors and variability properties , laying groundwork for the agn variability science possible with current and future multi - epoch ir surveys .",
    "the 2mass survey observed the full sky in the near - ir over the timespan of june 1997 to february 2001 using the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 bands @xcite .",
    "photometric zero - points for calibrating the survey were based on hourly observations of a set of 40 standard fields , each @xmath10 in size , and spaced evenly throughout the sky .",
    "these fields were visited repeatedly over the course of the survey , resulting in 562 to 3692 epochs of observation per field .",

    "these light curves are the most precise nir time domain survey to date and provide a novel dataset in which to study the infrared variability properties for a wealth of astrophysical phenomena .",

    "we make use of these data to search for nir variability of agn with unprecedented precision .    the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has created the deepest mid - ir survey of the entire sky in four photometric bands , from 3.4 @xmath11 m to 22 @xmath11 m .",
    "several recent studies have demonstrated the utility of wise colors for effectively separating agn from stars and unresolved galaxies .",
    "we spatially matched the cal - pswdb objects to the wise all sky data release using a match radius of 15 .",
    "this resulted in 52,148 objects with @xmath0 light curves and a detection in at least one wise filter .",
    "the distribution of these point sources in wise color  color space is shown in figure [ wcolor ] .",
    "for comparison , we show the wise `` blazar strip '' , defined in @xcite as the gaussian kernel density estimate of the wise colors of blazars from @xcite .",

    "objects were classified as variable if they had @xmath14 mag . of the `` milliquas '' agn in our dataset , only the known blazar , sdssj14584479 + 3720215 , exhibited variability above this threshold .",
    "the @xmath7-band and @xmath12 color light curves for this blazar , with 1972 epochs of cal - pswdb photometry spanning over three years , are presented in figure [ lc ] .",
    "the remaining 26 known agn in our sample displayed no significant nir variability using this metric .",
    "we found strong variability in sdssj14584479 + 3720215 in all three 2mass bands with our densely sampled light curves .",
    "however , as seen in figure [ lc ] no significant variation in @xmath12 color was found for this object , indicating the underlying variability was `` grey '' over this wavelength regime . a larger sample of such well studied variable objects is needed to test if this is truly a generic property of blazars in the nir .",
    "characterizing photometric variability timescales has proven to be a very efficient means of selecting a clean sample of agn from time domain surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the so - called `` damped random walk '' ( drw ) model provides a robust fit to agn light curves as a function of two observable free parameters : the characteristic timescale @xmath15 , and the variability amplitude sf@xmath16 .",
    "stars are easily removed when fit with this model , as their primary sources of variability are typically stochastic ( e.g. flares or flickering ) or strongly periodic ( such as pulsations or rotation ) in nature .",
    "combining drw variability models with multi - wavelength photometry provides even greater power in separating blazars from `` normal '' agn @xcite .    from our cal - pswdb",
    " wise matched sample we selected all light curves having at least 50 good @xmath7-band epochs ( ph_qual = a , b or c ) , median @xmath7-band magnitudes brighter than 16.5 mag , and wise colors of @xmath17 to remove main sequence stars @xcite .",
    "we also required sources to be detected as variable using the @xmath18 cut described above , and removed objects known to be periodic ( binaries and pulsating variables ) or long period variable stars ( * ? ? ? * davenport 2014 in prep ) .",
    "this yielded 22 variable cal - pswdb targets to search for drw timescales , which included our known blazar object , but did not select any other previously identified agn . for completeness",
    "we also analyzed the other 26 known `` milliquas '' sources for drw variability .",
    "for each object we down - sampled the light curves to a single data point per night , using the median of the @xmath7-band photometry , which reduced the light curves to an average of 144 epochs .",
    "we then ran the drw fitting code from @xcite and @xcite on the reduced @xmath7-band light curves for all 47 objects .",
    "we used the probability thresholds outlined in @xcite to determine which light curves had significant drw variability .",
    "the known blazar had a weakly constrained drw timescale of @xmath19 days , and a significant driving amplitude of @xmath20 mag year@xmath21 .",
    "the relative likelihood for the drw versus an infinite or unconstrained timescale was log(l@xmath22/l@xmath23 ) = 1.4 , where values greater than  0.05 are considered significant .",
    "similarly , the relative likelihood for the drw model versus pure noise was log(l@xmath22/l@xmath24 ) = 153 , which was much greater than the threshold for significance of 0 .",
    "none of the other 26 previously identified agn showed any signs of significant drw variability .",
    "however , 7 of the variability - selected objects did show significant drw variability .",
    "we discuss the origin of these objects in the following section .",
    "we additionally fit these light curves using the continuous auto - regressive moving average , or carma(p , q ) , models of @xcite , where @xmath25 is the auto - regressive order and @xmath26 the moving average order .",
    "the drw is a special case of the carma models , equivalent to a carma(1,0 ) , or a first - order continuous auto - regressive process with no moving average . in the carma formalism , a drw model s power spectral density is described as a single lorentzian function with a characteristic break frequency . as mentioned above , the drw has been shown to empirically model the behavior of qso light curves well , but is otherwise inflexible . by looking at higher order carma models we search for more complex behavior in the light curve power spectral density , such as stochastic variability on multiple timescales or quasi",
    " periodic oscillations . for sdssj14584479 + 3720215",
    "we found a moderate preference for the carma(2,0 ) model compared to a drw when using the deviance information criterion for model selection .",
    "the drw model provides a sufficient fit to the data , in that the sequence of residuals is independently and normally distributed .",
    "a markov chain monte carlo analysis of the carma(1,0 ) model provided 1-@xmath3 confidence levels on the timescale of @xmath27 days , and on the standard deviation of the driving noise of between 0.14 and 0.20 magnitudes .",
    "the recovered drw timescales for the seven variability - selected objects we found in the previous section had an average timescale of @xmath28 days , significantly shorter than the typical timescale seen in the optical for agn @xcite , as well as for our blazar target .",
    "this was reproduced in the carma(1,0 ) models as well .",
    "these seven objects all reside in field # 90009 , which was centered on the star forming region @xmath1 ophiuchus , making these likely ysos . of these ysos",
    ", five had x - ray detections in the literature , one coming from a targeted x - ray monitoring campaign of the field @xcite , and four from the chandra x - ray source catalog @xcite .",
    "the other two ysos in our sample did not have a published x - ray counterpart within 0.1@xmath29 .",
    "nir light curve properties for ysos within this field in the cal - pswdb have been studied in great detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these seven ysos had mid - ir colors that placed them within the blazar strip , nir variability amplitudes comparable to our known blazar , and light curves best parameterized by a carma(1,0 ) model .",
    "we thus highlight ysos as a potentially important source of contamination for classifying agn from future multi - wavelength time domain searches .",
    "while using longer wavelength filters can improve the efficiency of selecting agn from normal stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ysos remain a potential contaminant for object classification ( see also color spaces in fig 7 of * ? ? ?",
    ". however , these objects may be distinguished from bona fide agn based on their @xmath410x shorter characteristic timescales under a carma(1,0 ) model .",
    "ysos are also mostly confined to the galactic disk and dense star forming regions , and as such can be avoided by surveys .",
    "the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ provides the deepest survey to date in the 100 mev to 100 gev regime , and has discovered 886 @xmath2-ray agn in the 2nd _ fermi _ agn catalog @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of these agn are blazars .",
    "however , @xmath430% of _ fermi _ sources in the _ fermi _ 2nd point source catalog ( 2fgl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are unidentified , largely due to the poor angular resolution of _ fermi _",

    "thousands of potential faint @xmath2-ray blazars lie below the @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) detection threshold , but are difficult to localize due to extremely low photon counts .",
    "these faint @xmath2-ray blazars have large positional uncertainties , with error ellipses with radius @xmath3420  for 3@xmath3 fermi detections using 4 years of photon data @xcite .",
    "the strong @xmath0 variability exhibited by the blazar sdssj14584479 + 3720215 relative to the quasars in our sample suggests that this nir variability is likely to be indicative of strongly beamed jets , which are characteristic of blazars , and are known to produce strong @xmath2-ray emission .",
    "this allows for nir - variability based identification of previously unidentified or undetected @xmath2-ray blazars .",
    "sdssj14584479 + 3720215 was not included in the _ fermi _ 2fgl catalog , and thus had @xmath35 is 2 years of photon data .",
    "however , motivated by the strong nir variability we observe , we investigated whether this blazar can be detected at high significance using more photon data .",
    "we downloaded approximately 4.5 years of available pass 7 _ fermi _ photon data of the source event class , spanning mission elapsed time 239557417 to 383570220 seconds .",
    "we selected photons in the 200 mev to 100 gev energy range , within a 10@xmath29 region of interest ( roi ) centered on the blazar .    using the standard binned likelihood analysis scripts provided in the fermi science tools package , we performed photon event selection with a roi - based zenith angle cut of @xmath36100@xmath29 and a rock angle cut of @xmath3652@xmath29 .",
    "we produced a spatial model of the likely @xmath2-ray sources within 15@xmath29 of the blazar based on the 2fgl catalog , using the 2fgl best fit values for the template spectral model of these sources .",
    "we included the blazar sdssj14584479 + 3720215 as an additional point source , modeled as a simple power - law spectrum .",
    "the spectral normalization for all sources within 15@xmath29 was allowed to vary , and all spectral parameters were set as free parameters within the roi .",
    "we included the appropriate 2-year pass 7 galactic diffuse emission and extragalactic isotropic diffuse emission models in our source model fit to the observed counts map .",
    "the blazar sdssj14584479 + 3720215 is detected with @xmath37 , approximately a 5@xmath3 detection , with a @xmath2-ray power - law spectral slope of @xmath38 , typical of _ fermi _ blazars @xcite .",
    "this detection significance is consistent with the @xmath39 found in a preliminary version of the _ fermi _ 4-year point source catalog by @xcite , produced using 4 years of photon data .",
    "we note minor discrepancies in our modeling of the brightest object in the field , noticeable in the lower - left corner of the difference image .",
    "these are well - known issues in _ fermi _ source analysis caused by the finite resolution of the counts maps , and do not affect our detection .",
    "we have conducted a search for nir variability from agn using the 2mass c al - pswdb light curves .",
    "no significant variability was found for 26 of the 27 known agn in our sample .",
    "one previously known agn , showed strong variations in the 2mass filters , and we have presented the 1972 epoch nir photometric light curve for this blazar ( sdssj14584479 + 3720215 ) .",
    "this previously known blazar is a benchmark object , displaying almost 1 magnitude of variability in the @xmath0 bands , but with no significant variation in @xmath12 color .",
    "this is the best sampled nir light curve of a blazar ever measured .",
    "we note a handful of other agn candidates from the 2mass cal - pswdb were recently identified by @xcite , including the blazar sdssj14584479 + 3720215 .    our detection of sdssj14584479 + 3720215 as a @xmath2-ray source , selected by infrared variability , has implications on the association and classification of multi - wavelength counterparts of _ fermi _ sources .",
    "current selection methods such as mid - ir color @xcite and optical variability @xcite suffer from low efficiency .",
    "this is often due to `` normal '' type 1 quasars , which have similar colors in the mid - ir and are also variable in the optical .",
    "as this pilot study demonstrates , these issues may be surmounted by the inclusion of ir variability information , since normal agn are not significantly variable at this wavelength regime .",
    "a search for other such light curves in the 2mass cal - pswdb reveals a large number of contaminating ysos .",
    "this study establishes a baseline for the agn variability science possible with current and future multi - epoch ir missions such as the wise , the wide field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ; * ? ? ?",
