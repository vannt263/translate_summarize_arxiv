    "this set of data constitutes a very precious starting point for studying the multi - band variability of this object .",
    "in particular , with the launch of _ fermi _ in june 2008 an intense gamma - ray monitoring of the source has started @xcite and triggered observations along the whole electromagnetic spectrum , coordinated by several groups .",
    "this extensive and regular look at the source , together with the comparison with the historical long - term behaviour at all wavelengths , will allow us to investigate the properties and origin of the high - energy emission in greater detail than it had ever been done before .",

[ database ] ) .",
    "in addition , for the x - ray band , information about the spectral parameters used to extract the fluxes is also available .",

    "[ fvar ] ) .",
    "for example , the increasing amplitude of the variations and the decreasing time scales when going from long radio to short millimeter wavelengths is the typical signature of the superposition of synchrotron flares from shock waves propagating along the jet .",
    "the different variability properties in the x - rays below and above 20 kev seem to support the possibility of two separated emitting components , possibly non thermal comptonisation ( as in seyfert galaxies ) and inverse compton from the jet ( as in blazars ) .",
    "as an alternative , a single component characterised by at least two independently varying parameters could also explain the x - ray timing properties .    in any case",
    ", the dominant hard x - ray ( @xmath5 ) emission is most probably not due to electrons accelerated by the shock waves in the jet as their variability does not correlate with the flaring millimeter emission at short time lags ( fig .",

    "the hard x - rays seem to be associated to long - timescale variations in the optical domain .",
    "this optical component is consistent with being optically thin synchrotron radiation from the base of the jet and the hard x - rays would be produced through inverse compton processes ( synchrotron self - compton and/or external compton ) by the same electron population .        in the gamma - ray domain , the limited data available before _",
    "agile _ and _ fermi _ observations did not allow to draw a firm conclusion about the variability in the mev - gev energy range .",
    "the increase of the variability amplitude observed in the x - rays seems to continue up to the gamma - rays , possibly even above 100  mev where the observed decrease is likely due to the large uncertainties of the egret fluxes ( circles in fig .",

    "a flux variability by a factor of 4 within one week is the most extreme behaviour observed for  at gamma - rays by egret @xcite .",
    "multiwavelength campaigns have been carried out simultaneously to the the gamma - ray observations in 19931995 and showed that the emission detected by egret can be equally well explained with synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) , external compton ( ec ) or proton - initiated cascade ( pic ) models @xcite .    during the first year of observations , _",

    "the average flux above 100  mev , @xmath16 , is significantly larger than the historical measurements of egret , with a peak flux of @xmath1 detected during a large flare in september 2009 .",

    "the decrease of @xmath17 observed with egret above 100  mev was likely due to its limited sensitivity .",
    "in addition , the amplitude of the variations measured in the gamma - rays by _ fermi _ is the highest across the whole electromagnetic spectrum , confirming the extreme variability nature of the gamma - ray emission .         on the last 3 months of observations . during the large flare of september 2009",

    ", the variations of the spectral slope do not seem to be significant , when the uncertainties are taken into account , with the exception of a decrease of the photon index when the source brightened during the last 3 months of observations ( fig .",
    "[ fermi_flare ] ) .",
    "in fact , when plotting the photon index versus flux , the source behaviour `` harder when brighter '' is clearly observed ( fig .",
    "[ fermi_scatter ] ) : when  was brighter than @xmath20 , the photon index was always smaller than 2.8 .",
    "the same effect was observed also in egret data during two flares of  @xcite and seems to be a common behaviour of the gamma - ray emission of blazars ( see for example 3c  454.3 and ao  0235 + 164 ; @xcite ) . as proposed by pacciani et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to explain the gamma - ray variability observed with _",
    "agile _ , the inverse compton peak might be shifted toward higher frequencies following an accelaration episode of the electron population . since the inverse compton peak of  usually falls in the 110 mev range @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ sed ] ) , a shift toward higher energies could indeed produce a harder spectrum in the lat energy band .     with photon indices always below the average value of @xmath21.,width=226 ]",
    "gamma - ray observations of  are essential to constrain the overall shape of the inverse compton branch and to better understand the connection between the jet emission in different energy domains .",
    "the most recent radio to gamma - ray campaigns carried out on this object , together with the numerous ones performed in the past , provide a large set of data to model the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) during several epochs and with different integration times ( the average sed in fig .",
    "[ sed ] ) .",
    "multiwavelength campaigns performed during egret observations could not discriminate between the most common models used to describe the high - energy emission of blazars @xcite .",
    "a different variability behaviour below and above @xmath22 suggested that two different mechanisms are responsible for the emission in the mev and in the egret domain , with the latter one being most likely produced by inverse compton scattering of accretion disc photons @xcite . on the other hand , the different variability of the hard x - rays and gamma - rays detected by _",
    "integral _ and _ agile _ has been explained by a single external compton component shifted toward higher energies following an acceleration of the electron population , whereas a synchrotron self - compton contribution is evident at lower energies @xcite .",
    "several multiwavelength monitoring programs are on - going to follow the evolution of  and many other gamma - ray sources .",
    "the preliminary results presented during the _ 2009 fermi symposium _ for  indicate that there is a correlation between the gamma - ray flaring states and the brightening of the vlbi core , with gamma - ray flare following the ejection of a superluminal knot by up to 70 days @xcite .",
    "this would indicate that the gamma - ray high states are related to a disturbance crossing the millimeter - jet core .",
    "an increase of the radio emission at 15  ghz has been observed quasi - simultaneously to the large september 2009 gamma - ray flare , and the optical flux started also to increase in july / august 2009 , but no data were available at the time of the gamma - ray flare @xcite .",
    "in addition , a correlation between the small gamma - ray flare of april 2009 and the optical emission is clearly detected @xcite .    as the flaring optical emission of",
    "is believed to be synchrotron emission related to the millimeter jet , a gamma - ray / optical correlation would support the origin of the high - energy emission in the millimeter jet and could indicate that the same electron population is responsible for both emissions through synchrotron and inverse compton processes . on the other hand , we found the hard x - ray emission to be related rather to another optical component , varying on longer time scales , and produced as synchrotron emission further away from the millimeter jet @xcite .",
    "therefore , this would point to a different origin of the hard x - ray and gamma - ray emissions .",
    "thanks to its large field of view and its unprecedented sensitivity above 100 mev , the lat instrument is providing us with long - term , well sampled light curves and spectral information for a large number of agn @xcite . among them ,  is a bright quasar extensively observed at all wavelengths and showing a particularly intense gamma - ray activity since the launch of _ fermi_. this source was detected during the first 15 months of observations with an average flux of @xmath0 , corresponding to an average luminostity of @xmath23 , and an average photon index of @xmath4 . in september 2009 , during a very bright flare reaching a peak flux of @xmath1 , the hint of a spectral hardening accompanied the brightening of the source , possibly indicating a shift of the inverse compton peak from 110 mev ( as typically observed in ) toward higher energies .",
    "when looking at the multi - band behaviour , the amplitude of the variations seems to constantly increase from the x - rays up to the gamma - rays , with the mev - gev range showing the largest variations along the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "on one side the correlation of the gamma - rays with the millimeter jet and with the optical flaring component @xcite , and on the other side the lack of correlation between the hard x - rays and the millimeter emission @xcite might indicate a different origin of the high - energy emission below and above the peak of the inverse compton hump .",
    "an extensive correlation study and an accurate modelling of the broad band spectral energy distribution during several epochs @xcite will allow to shed more light on the origin of the gamma - rays in  and their connection to the emission in other bands .",
